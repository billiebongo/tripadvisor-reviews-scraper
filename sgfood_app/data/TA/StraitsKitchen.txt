It has been a few months since my last visit to The Straits Kitchen, my favourite buffet in town. It was easy to like this place because everything they served up was top quality, or at least you can tell they tried their best.But, my last visit two weeks ago was a rude surprise as the drop in quality and service standards were so noticeable. Looking back, the decline was very subtle and had begun more than a year ago eg the Kueh Dadar was no longer made on the spot at the local dessert counter. It was a popular great in-house dessert but they removed it and farmed it out to a supplier. It was never the same again.I noticed the Popiah was also no longer the same as it was, which was a pity as it was one of my favourite draws to this place. Also, when I asked for two pieces in English, the lady server looked at me and answered in Mandarin. When I told her I did not understand what she was saying to me, she quickly replied in English. I did not appreciate her service approach.Even the Chinese wok station's food was noticeably sub standard. The steamed fish looked messily unpresentable with its dug in appearance. And the number of items seemed reduced.Another favourite was the Satay station. This too failed in service when the servers were standing around not grilling the chicken satay (which is usually the most popular) while there was only one stick lying on the tray. They only started grilling it when approached by me. I wonder if this is an efficient way of serving their customers ie grilling on demand or is it a way to slow down consumption? I walked away without eating satay as I did not feel like going back to be disappointed or have to be kept waiting again.One more let down for me was the durian ice cream. It was watered down to a more milky taste than the strong durian flavor it used to be. Disappointing to say the least.The redeeming stations are the Indian and Roast Meat Counters which did not fail me.I hope the Management and Chefs at Straits Kitchen will bring back their glorious standards to showcase Singapore's multi-racial and cultural flavors. You can do it

So much varity from Malay, Indian, Chinese, western and nyonya. Included in buffet are many kind of drinks. They even make fresh tea and coffee tarik. Cold drinks and fresh fruit juice also included. Price above average but i feel it is worth the money spent if you are big eater. They also provide prayer rooms for man and women separately complete with ablution area
5
We stayed at the grand Hyatt and ate at the restaurant 2 times per day almost. They have a good abundance of choices from the region, like you would find in the local hawker center. The food taste and quality were amazing. Definitely one of the spots i will remember for the next tri

I have friends from Indonesia for visit. This is one of the best Asian Hala food available in Singapore. With a great variety of food and desert is no mistake to be at.Great ambience and support staff
5
A lovely way to spend a special occasion and with a large array of cuisines at the buffet, it’s great
5
I had a wonderful dinner with my family , we have a lot of different kind of food in one restaurant which is a good ideal fir the traveller .. one place for all !!! Seem to be shortage of manpower however all of your staff still provide a good service to the guest .. sure we will be back again !!

A sumptuous buffet spread based mainly of traditional Asian favourites. Satay, Char Quay teow, otah, Prata, Murtabak, you name it, you will find it here. All in a very trendy place, right in the Orchard road. Well stocked juice bar where I could find celery and cucumber juice and other freshly squeezed juices. There is a pretty decent Indian corner as well, the offerings include prawn curry, malai chicken kebab and tandoori mutton chops, later is a must try. Overall a double thumbs up for Straight kitchen

Asian food buffet is great with a wide variety of food. Good spread of desserts too. Will recommend for big group dinin
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the wide selection of local & asian food! Weekend lunch buffet starts at 12:30pm. Would have loved to have local kopi and teh though
5
I took business colleagues to this restaurant within the Grand Hyatt Singapore after a recommendation. And we were not disappointed, a buffet journey through Asia was truly exceptional, the food choice, the textures and taste were a gourmet delight. The staff were helpful professional and the atmosphere relaxed. A great place to visit for business and or just good old dining out, well worth a visit, if only for the soft crab!
4
It's been awhile since I was last back and at that time, they served up one of the best Indian meals at breakfast. Seriously underated. Today, quality has slipped a little but still good. Service is good, even at peak hour. The selection of food is great, as is quality of produce
4
Fantastic local spread and quality food. Worth the money. We really enjoyed the food. Son ate oysters to hearts delight and chilli crab was good.
4
great food..a lot of variety and choices...always enjoy the dessert there..durian ice cream is really good..
4
I was surprised at the amazing assortment of appetizers, soups, dishes and desserts they offered on their buffet line. Recommend you go there with the intent of trying as many local dishes as you're able to consume. Don't overfill your plate with any one dish as there are way to many dishes to try. Highly recommend
4
The food is very good. The price a little on a steep side for local fares. The fisball noodles and the chicken soup is terrible. Should look into it. The service is pretty alright as there wasn't much crowd on Monday night
4
cosy ambience for dinner & catch up w friends! food selection was ok; price a bit on the steep side th

We enjoyed the Saturday lunch buffet. In particular, the Malay food was exceptional, especially the otak-otak which had the right flavour. Also, the chef was happy to custom-make my rojak according to my requirements. The dessert table was quite good and there were already some Chinese New Year cookies out though our visit was in December. Service staff were attentive and plates were cleared in quick time.
5
Good food that captures the cuisines of Chinese, Indian and Malay. Many selections of heavy food and a myriad of desserts! Awesome
4
Everything was delicious and fresh. Halal Asian Fares. Wide varities and very value for money. 1 problem was it took them very long to clear the tables. We had to call them 2 and 3 times to ask for our used plates to be cleared. Other than that, food was great
4
It's been awhile since I last visited Straits Kitchen, and boy, they didn't certainly disappoint me! They had a wide variety of Asian food, which was great coz it's definitely spoilt for choices. The desserts were nice too, mainly traditional kuehs. The wait staffs were friendly too. Will definitely be back here again
4
It was a very relax year-end get together lunch in a very soothing ambience. Overall the food is good but you should not miss our in trying their naan with butter chicken and palak paneer. Its yummy. Also service staff were attentive.

I booked a special Christmas Eve dinner online and received a confirmation. However the staff claimed that no booking existed and were quite rude and condescending. They even implied that I must have booked a different restaurant. Annoying I had problems with my mobile phone so couldn't prove it, but upon returning home I was able to double check the booking and sure enough I was right. Maybe they had computer problems but there's no excuse for the rudeness
4
Enjoyed the great variety of Malay, Chinese, North Indian, and local food, with free flow of fruit juice and coffee and tea from the machines.My favourites were the chicken rice, Tandoori chicken, satay, otak, orh nee, popiah and the pandan kaya cake. As we came on the Friday before Christmas, it was rather crowded as many patrons were given the afternoon off at work.The lunch was good value with the 1-for-1 with the UOB Visa Infinite
4
Despite it being hawker fare, the selection is excellent and there's a wide variety too! The ambience is good for large groups as well!
5
This is my favorite buffet ever. Everything is so delicious, quality is top-notch. There is something for everyone here. I love the tandoori chicken and the biryani rice. I think Straits Kitchen has one of the best indian cuisine in Singapore. The ambience is wonderful too. Highly recommended for all
3
I've been here for dinner before and the selection is better (they only have the chilli crab at dinner). Food was good, but not a massively wide selection in my opinion. Service was excellent though! A great place to take out-of-town guests so they can try all the different local foods (and then you can take them to specific restaurants when they know what they like!
4
It is always a pleasure to be at Straits Kitchen. A sampling of Singapore food most available in the market but now setting in a clean and good ambience restaurant. Staff always on hand to remove the used place better then many other buffet place. Many choices of desert available
3
You will find the food excellent on your first visit. As they do not change the variety of the dishes in the buffet line, subsequent visit will be very very boring
4
We enjoyed the different food and everything was very tastefull. Busy place and you might need a reservation. Service so and so like most buffet restaurants, but always quick if you asked for something
4
Had a great time and enjoyed the food. The Asian style Buffet suits those who love Singaporean food. Staffs are friendly and attentive.
2
Comparing their breakfast with the one I had yesterday at the Regent hotel....just no comparison.It is like the difference between the earth and the sky!Limited varieties of bread.Limited varieties of sausages No cheese available until I told the head waiters, that made only 2 poor items availableNo meat cold cuts (salaries, etc...)Tea took them 10 minutes to bringLadies and gentlemen, it was a mild joke!!
3
The beverage section only consists of a variety of coffee/tea and assorted fruit/veg juices. I am not a coffee drinker so my choice is only narrowed down to tea and juices. However their juices didn't taste good. No offer of water or at self help station. Indian section was good. Steamed fish had lots of unremoved scales and Crab was salty, laksa and Prawn noodles were good from the Chinese section. Only had satay from the Malay section. Too much curry, spices and spicy food. Not a good buffet to bring children. Dessert section has a good selection but limited ice cream sorbet selection, only 2-3 types each. However dessert weren't that yummy too. Staff were great though. Overall, could have add $20 more for an international buffet experience

I have stayed at the hotel many times but usually eat breakfast elsewhere. This time breakfast was included in my room rate so of course decided to try it. At first glance there seemed to be so many choices but depending what kind of breakfast you eat the choices became much smaller. Ordering coffee when we were first shown to a table was quite a chore as the waitress struggled with English and got the order wrong. Luckily I then found a serve yourself machine. Where were all of the beautiful tropical fruits? I found watermelon and pineapple. Sides to go with my poached eggs? There were lots of sausages, potatoes and a vegetable dish but Where were the simple grilled tomatoes or bacon? Clearing tables also took forever. I think this is my last visit for breakfast, definitely not my choice of breakfast food
1
Pretty lousy service. Did not make an effort to satisfy customer. Did not bother to chat with us. Only interested in making coffee. Did not clear tables promptly. Not like a great hotel at all.

We returned to Straits Kitchen for a business dinner at the invitation of a business colleague. We were a big group and were accommodated in the private area so we could have our business dinner privately.Straits Kitchen still serve the best Asian buffet in Singapore. There are 4 main sections; the Starter/Dessert Station, Indian Station, Chinese Station and Malay Station. The food are all cooked fresh right there and then by the chefs. I started with freshly made popiah from the Starter Station which was very yummy. You could also get your rojak made for you at the this station. The butter curry chicken from the Indian Station is to die for! You can order prawn noodle soup, fried kueh tiaw and chicken rice from the Chinese Station. The Malay Station served satay and the usual Malay dishes eg. nasi campur, beef rendang etc.The last time I visited Straits Kitchen was 3 years ago but the quality of the food and professional service remains top notch. You canâ€™t go wrong if you choose to have some Asian buffet at Straits Kitchen as the food is absolutely delicious. Their service remains impeccable too. Waiters are always on hand to clear the table as soon as you finish your dish. Highly recommended!

A friend invited me to celebrate deepavali in straitskitchen buffet for lunch. The place was crowded (well what can u expect, its holiday) . Still we enjoyed all the local food that they have, and i like the waitress attitude, they were very accomodating and smiling while serving. We will surely come back but not in a busy day i guess
5
Eaten here for dinner a couple of times but tried the breakfast buffet for the first time. Has a combination of western style breakfast together with local breakfast cuisine. Quite an amazing mix of breakfast food options. And love the large fresh juice selection and coffee machine. Though an enjoyable breakfast, you really need to dine here for the dinner buffet especially if you're looking for all the various local cuisines in one location and unlimited servings. And I did on the same trip
5
This is a great place to come with family and friends, especially those visiting overseas in order to show them a variety of Singaporean dishes in only one place. The service is fantastic and the food is supreme. It is buffet style, desserts and non-alcoholic drinks are also included. Worth trying

Did not know that this was a buffet. I generally do not like buffets because I have a lot of allergies, but since we had the reservation, we stayed. Good thing we did. This was a wonderful introduction to Singaporean and Malaysian cuisine (which I have never had before apart from beef rendang). There was some tasty Indian food and Chinese food as well. I had never seen or tried about a quarter of the desserts.Pros:1. Great food - standouts were the satay and peanut sauce and almost all of the Indian dishes. I mainly had Indian dishes because most of these are vegetarian. All the rice I had was perfectly cooked, which is rare for a buffet. I liked the beef rendang. It was spicier than what I have had before, but I didn't mind.2. Stiff cocktail - I had a coconut cocktail that had Mailbu, fresh coconut water and a ribbon of coconut jelly. It was outstanding. I would go back for that drink alone.3. Variety - this is divided by Indian, Malay/Singapore, and Chinese food. There is a coffee, tea area, a fresh juice area, and a dessert area. I tried durian ice cream. I personally found it to be awful and pallet busting (I only had one teaspoon), but to each his own.4. Decor - modern, clean. This also is a lot more casual than I expected. Most ladies wore a nice top and jeans. No need to dress up too much for this which is good for a tourist.Cons:1. Busy - we went on a Saturday night. Place gets very crowded after 8:00 pm. It is a buffet, so fellow patrons can be greedy. Food runs out fast and things like the satay were not replenished for a good 40-50 minutes.2. Spicy - I have a very high spice tolerance, so for the most part, I did not struggle with the food and actually loved it. However, my friend struggled a lot with the Indian dishes as they were too spicy for her. So, if you don't like spice or cannot tolerate it for dietary reasons, you might not have the best of times here.3. Service - there are not enough servers. They were stretched really thin and it took a long time to get drinks, the bill... The service was impersonal as a result.4. Labels - I don't think half the dishes had labels. I took a shrimp chip thinking that it was a mini version of something else. I am allergic to shrimp and immediately had to take a Benedryll, but still had a small breakout. Please label the food as it was sometimes difficult to get the attention of the chefs as they were busy cooking behind the buffet. Taking a Benedryll after 22+ hours of flying, adjusting to a 15C+ degree temperature and humidity, and a stiff drink, made me extremely groggy and dizzy. We left the buffet earlier than anticipated because I was falling asleep at the table. I asked what was in everything before taking it except of that one chip. Overall, a great meal apart from the allergic reaction. If you have allergies, and even if you are familiar with some of the dishes, ask what's in them as almost all of the Malay dishes had seafood or some kind of fish stock in them

Overall quality of food is sub parChoice is rather limitedService is poor due to lack of personnelSignature dish, Rendang, is not authentic with over use of spicesIndian food not up to standards: Tasteless biryanniMost local dishes don't match Singapore food centers'Decor is goo

The service there was quite bad and the extra juices even cost $10!The only person that is friendly is someone called Ronald

What I liked1. When, I booked I didn't realize this would be a buffet. We were told a la carte is only after 10 pm. The buffet turned out to be a great option since it allowed us to enjoy so many different types of food - Indian Chinese Malay.2. After visiting other restaurants in Singapore, we think the dishes were the most authentic in a nice setting ( Grand Hyatt hotel). The food was well seasoned and some a bit spicy.3. Great food drinks and coffee or tea selection included in buffet price4. Very nice relaxing evening!5. Great location- right off Orchard road and walking distance from Orchard subwayWhat could be improved1. The buffet price is around 70 dollars. Based on this price and the size of the restaurant I find they were too understaffed. The wait staff never had a moment rest and it took at least 15 minutes to even get their attention to pay the bill. 2. The drinks are in glass containers at the drink bar. They should either not be filled up to the top or the guy at the counter would be of better use if he helped fill people's glasses. Several people kept spilling juiceOther1. If you want to try "Durian", then the ice cream is available. Personally I didn't like it and found it stinks like rotting onion
5
Have been here several times with family and friends. last visit in September 2017. The restaurant offers a buffet of Asian Cuisine, good place to try most of the regional cuisines under one roof, the buffet is sumptuous supported with appropriate desserts. Good for Family, Friends, Business and Couples. Recommended for visitors on short trips who want to try the regional cuisine within one dinner
5
I would like to compliment straits kitchen team for the splendid coordination for my fiancee's bday celebration. Made reservations on 29th Sep 2017 via email, speedy replies. Request for complimentary cake fulfilled. She love the chocolate cake, unable to finish as both of us is too full from the delicious spread of food. Compliments to staffs; kristine, lucia, foo, prasad, anantha (a few i can remember). These staff went their extra mile for the excellent service. I will return here again for dinner or maybe lunch with friends & families

I visited this place for a Saturday lunch as was looking forward to some good food after reading the many reviews. However, I was appalled to find the low standard of many signature Singaporean dishes such as the laksa and popiah. The chefs at the station were also constantly away from the stations and they were apparently preparing other things.  The overall service standard of the place was bad and the portions of the food was so big that we ended up wasting a lot of food. I was also stunned to hear that I had to pay $10 for a cup of sugarcane juice. Shouldn't drinks be free flow in a buffet? I will never come back here for lunch again
4
Brought our overseas guest to try out Singapore food. Service was excellent esp the lady who served us. Think her name was Guita. Food is great as usual too.
5
A great place in a formal dining setting to sample almost all types of food delicacies of Singapore. The service is excellent and its worth paying the little high price
4
Quality was good. Wide choices over different cuisines. Quality was good. Staff were friendly. The low side was the data provided for each food and cuisines. If you are a forigner, you hardly can know the taste or ingredients of foods just by names
4
You get to taste multi cuisine under one roof here. There are respective specialty stations - eg. Tandoori, Chicken Rice, Juice Bar, etcHowever, I do not recall seeing a fresh cold seafood station. If you are looking for a good Halal Buffet in Singapore, this is certainly one of the better ones
4
Buffet with a wide range of variety from many different asian cuisine . Great enviroment . Staff were very friendly and attentive
5
We have a very unforgettable family dinner last week , just in one place can try all the local cuisine , my parents love the Indian corner very much and the service is incredible. We sure will be back soon!
5
Special compliments to chefs Lau Chee Singapore, Ng Ee Huat and Nelson Wong. Their dedication, passion and attitude towards their work is commendable. They pay detailed attention to the dishes served and make sure that food is always replenished to meet the needs of us. As for Chef Nelson Wong, I used to patronise Pete's Place and knew him from there. His excellent service is also worth mentioning. With his wide knowledge and skills in cooking, he is able to bring out the taste in even the simplest ingredients. Hope to see him back in Pete's Place again. Keep up the good work, Chefs! *thumbs up

If you're looking for a wide variety of halal food under one roof, this is the place to head to. Unlike many other buffets, there are chefs at each station ensuring freshness and high quality food at all times. The ability to see them at work lends a visual enjoyment while reminding diners of the authenticity of the food. This is especially valuable at the satay and prata stations. The satay is beautifully succulent and flavourful with a wonderful char one can only get from fresh grilling. The prata is at once fluffy and crispy, unlike the lacklustre flat pancakes one usually finds at hotel buffet lines. In terms of variety, the Straits Kitchen seems to have been set up very much like a high end hawker centre with different stations representing different stalls and cuisines - the chicken rice was glistening and offered a fab array of condiments. The Indian food had all the favourites - tandoori, butter chicken, naan, prata... I wish I had more stomach space.The crabs were another favourite at our table and when we asked for a crab cracker, the staff also brought a bowl of water for our fingers, showing thought and consideration. The service was attentive and pleasant and whilst the happy birthday singing seemed slightly awkward, the earnestness and sincerity of their delivery was charming.The durian ice cream was surprisingly full of durian flavour and despite the Horlicks ice cream not tasting all that Horlicky in contrast, there was a lovely malty texture which more than made up for it.What I also love about SK is their juice bar offerings of calamansi (perfect combination of sweet and sour without tasting like concentrate), guava, pineapple and mango (thick but v sweet) and red Apple juice - most other hotel buffets aren't as generous with their drink options.That being said, it's not big on international fare so if you need your sashimi and pasta, you're not gonna get it here. All in all, a wonderful option for tourists seeking local fare and Muslims seeking halal food
3
The last time I visited Straits Kitchen was several years ago. There is a clear marked drop in the variety and quality of the food.
4
Buffet with various local dishes from China, Indonesia etc. The food was good and the service/staff very friendl
4
I used to patronize Straits Kitchen either for lunch or dinner and I realised that the soup has a better taste now as compared earlier.However I noticed that simple prawn crackers are missing which I used to pacify the children.May I suggest the Kitchen takes some initiatives to improve the menu out there
5
I enjoyed lunch here with a friend. Most of the food was quite heavy Malaysian food - very tasty though, but what we loved, and what we went back for seconds, was the soup. The first soup we had was the laksa. Best laksa I've tasted with the right amount of heat in it. The second soup was hot and sour brother. As name suggests, it was 'hot' but it was soooo good. I'd go back here just for the soups
4
One can choose from the Chinese, Indian, English buffet style breakfast selection. Plenty of different fruit juices, bread as well. There are various stations for noodles, eggs etc. Recommended to go if you are staying in Hyatt.
4
One of the better looking restaurants for Halal buffet. Food selection is great, as with its name it's South and South East Asian dishes. Duck rice - 5 stars Indian dishes - 4 stars Malay dishes - 4 stars Laksa noodles- 4 stars Dessert - 3 stars Overall very good and nice place to visit with family. Service was great!
5
From food to ambience to service. This spot is an excellent one. Kudos! I really recommend this to all couples out there. If you want to have a great food trip experience, try StraitsKitchen. 
4
All staff are very helpful, friendly & accomodative from the start till the end of our evening. Great place for a celebration definitely! Thank you to all staff on 16th August 2017.
5
Very good buffet spread ,a variety of cuisine and dessert can choose. Nice service staff even if the restaurant a bit busy, they still willing to help us.Nice and unforgettable experience
5
The people were nice and accommodating. Aside from the sumptuous food they served, the ambiance of the restaurant added to the great experience I had. I will surely return and eat at StraitsKitchen.
4
The dinner buffet was excellent with a wide selection of local favourites such as fried carrot cake, Hainanese chicken rice, satay (barbecue meat on skewers), Indian curry fish etc. Desserts were of great assortment, such as Nonya kueh (sweet rice cakes with coconut milk), yam paste and ice cream of local flavours.
5
We have a family dinner few days back , my family love the food so much especially the Indian corner although a little bit spicy for their age but they enjoy it so much ! Receive very warm & friendly service from the waiter & waitress ... we definitely will be back !
5
Lots of choices. affordable and great value. We love the dessert sections. It's delicious and there is even ice chendol and ice kachang. Our favourites
3
We came here expecting to have sumptuous dinner considering it was part of Grand Hyatt Hotel. Unfortunately, we were disappointed because the choices were limited and the taste was on average. One thing we liked was that the foods were halal so we could enjoy our dinner with no worry. Muslim readers, hence, could put this restaurant on their list of limited halal food establishments
3
Two of us had a very late lunch of prawn mee. Being an all time local favorite, I felt the prawn stock was rather uninspiring. It did not have the robust flavors that you find in some specialist prawn mee stalls. I would rate it very average. The restaurant was empty apart from the 2 of us, & yet I had to ask 3x for water, where no apology was given. Alan LeongSingapore
5
It's always good to dine in air condition place especially in a country like Singapore when you want to try the local food and yet wanted to escape the humidity out in the open.Straits kitchen serves most of the local delicacies, clean and authentic .It has also become one of my favorite place to host friends from overseas at this heritage restaurant. Because it's in a buffet spread, they will be no fuss in taking considerations of what allergies or food preferences the guests have . The local desserts are especially good in strong and rich coconut 
4
This is our 2nd visit, company dinner. As we have a Malay colleague, we opt for this buffet that is HalalSetup is pretty much the same, still have lots of choices of food, covering almost all of the local delight.Personally, Satay is my favourite, my colleagues enjoyed the Chinese double boiled soup.This will be a good choice if you are looking for Halal or if you need to host overseas friends that like to have most of the local food under one roo
3
We frequented this at night for a quiet beer or wine and most of the staff were lovely. Some seriously acted like they couldn't see you. I did have a burger for lunch one day, it was sloppy and the fries were so salty I couldn't eat them. I'll stick to the wine next time.
4
Had a great afternoon break with well laid out seating, friendly staff and sumptious buffet as well as menu
5
We have a wonderful dinner at StraitsKitchen. Serve many different types of local dishes in one place , which is the best place to dine especially if you have foreign friends. Attentive and friend service receive from the restaurant staff.

What was meant to be a memorable occasion, celebrating the landmark 70th birthday of my dear brother at Hyatt, was quickly dashed as soon as we were shown our seats at the restaurant. The food on display that evening, made the aircon even colder as we shivered in despair at what was put on offer. Do note that this wasn't our first visit but we've been here so often that we invested in a membership from what we had previously experienced. Little did we know that complacency was what was served to us. The food at each of the various stations got from bad to worst, it was like a bad horror movie where the guests were forced to eat their own entrails. It's like the restaurant just gave up and didn't even want to try to live up to their premium billing. The food tasted like it was cooked the night before, and only chucked in the microwave an hour or so before. We would've been better off buying a happy meal from Mac D's for what we paid but at $70.00 ++per pax, one can hardly blame us for expecting a lil more, happy meal toy included. Now I'm stuck with this membership card that I wouldn't even sell at half price on carousell, in fear of negative review i'll get from peddling such a card. But if there was a saving grace that sour abysmal evening, it was that the server sending our drinks was courteous and helpful as he ran back and forth to get everyone in my entourage a cup of teh tarik so kudos to him. To say I will not return to this restaurant is an understatement, for i would be repulse to even walk on the footpath outside this overcharging nose-in-the-air hotel. Thank you but I will spend my hard earned cash somewhere better
3
Been a choice restaurant for introducing local cuisine to overseas friends. Recent visit was disappointing with food quality and service not worthy of a 5-star. Time to invest in more staff and quality control
5
My friend and I were there to enjoy a birthday dinner. The restaurant serves a wide buffet spread of Asian styled dishes and there is always a crab dish. The crab dish is cooked with spring onion and chilli padi, and is delicious. Yummy! The cooking style is different from the precious time that I had dinner at Straits Kitchen, which is black pepper style. Well, both styles are superb! I think my friend ate at least 3 crabs! They also surprised us with a birthday cake and a fun birthday song! And the service is also good. The dessert chef also creates interesting dessert for us with ice cream and other dessert items! Thumbs up to him.
5
Was there for my wife's birthday. They granted my request to surprise my wife. Food was excellent and wide variety. However the service provide was abit lacking.. staff was insufficient i guess.. that we actually took the plain water ourselves from the counter.. not yo blame them as the crowd was huge.. kudos straits kitvhe
5
In a word, outstanding. Everything was great, from the service to the food to the price. Will be back next time I am in town.
5
I visited for having lunch buffet on Sunday.As I traveled alone and was difficult to have many kind of Singapore local food, so decided to go this restaurant.There were many kinds of Asian foods, not only Singapore food, such as Indonesian food or Chinese food.I wanted to try all dishes but could not, so I will go again in the next time
4
The buffet in the afternoon provides a wide spectrum of local and SE Asian food. The qualities of most food are good. The drinks of fresh fruits are good for thirst especially in tropical country.The restaurant is always fully booked and advance booking is recommended.One defect is that the 'Club at the Hyatt Card' cannot be utilized unless you live in the Hotel. This practice is not that acceptable
3
Was here when my boss treat us for lunch. They serves mostly are local food and some peranakan and Indian food. For me, the food just OK. Nothing really impress me there. But it could be a great place to have family lunch or dinner. Bear in mind, during peak hours it could be very crowded and noisy. It will be better if you do rsvp
5
Very good representation for Singaporean cuisine, all at one place! Love the indian cuisine the most! Can miss the chinese section!
4
Nice place, good ambiance, different cuisines, fast service and better taste. What else do you need? Staffs are not that friendly. We didn't get a good smile from any staff. We went for dinner and has a good time
4
A cut above most Asian hotel buffets, along the lines of the Shangri-la's Cafe Too. Specialist stands with the chefs doing their thing, always a plus for us foodies. This time I chose the breakfast a la carte menu, breakfast mee fan for myself and my colleague choosing the fresh yoghurt and fruit plates. The noodles were I must say, fantastic, appropriately spicy and a massive portion. The yoghurt and fruit for my health conscious friend were both well presented, excellent quality and generous portions. While the venue was chosen for us for convenience sake, it was not a place for a business meeting as it was noisy what with the influx of tourists and a good smattering of children running about. I'd suggest it as a place for food consumption only and for gawking at the chefs' expertise - leave the paperwork at home
5
We are regulars to the Straits Kitchen as we particularly enjoy the Indian cuisine which is consistently good. The Pilau rice is exceptionally fluffy and the naan cooked to perfection. There is also a wide choice of prawns, fish, meat and vegetarian dishes to suit all tastes. We've never been let down.There is also a wide choice of Malay and Chinese favourites of which the roast duck is well worth a mention. The sweet selection is also very good as I'm particularly partial to the durian ice cream!The service is attentive and as soon as you have finished one course the old dishes are whisked away.This establishment is highly recommended for the buffet lunch when visiting Singapore as the food is authentic and the setting very comfortable
5
we come here almost once a month. the food is consistently good, freshly made and promptly replenished. it's a convenient way to get all your local favorites under one roof ( with aircon ! 
5
I have been here now a couple of times and the food is just fabulous. If you go for lunch bring a good appetite as the choice and selection is juts awesome and the flavours are authentic. Street food in a more luxury setting. All self service buffet style and I will be back

The buffet restaurant is on the ground floor of the Grand Hyatt and offers a great array of local Singapore dishes. There's bound to be something for everyone. They have curries, satays, sashliks, sushi, chilli crab etc. Service is great to

Definitely 1 of d worst restaurant I ever eat probably because I juz comeback from Japan where d food in general were superb even 7 - 11 food was better than this !We ordered Laksa (too spicy ), Cheese Burger was dry (d beef patty) and Rendang was tasteless and the worst was Hor Fun. The only good food was Hainan Chicken Rice.Service was okMy guessed was we come 10 pm so they rushed our order so d result was unacceptable.
5
My experience at straits kitchen is awesome and superb. I would like to thank the two servers, Mr Kok Sing and Miss May for attending to our family needs. Both of them deserve a commendation for their patience. Mr Kok Sing has gone out of his way to give my father a glass of warm water for his throat as he was coughing alot and without even asking from Mr Kok Sing. Thank you very much for tremendous hospitality.
5
This Waitress is very friendly and helpful and fast in her work. Good Job Nami. Enjoy our Team dinner at this restaurant and food is nice.
5
This is the first time we went to a buffet with no sashimi and fresh seafood, my husband was quite paranoid and hesitant about it. But it turned out that all went well. The food was super delicious especially the Indian cuisine. I would also like to compliment Kristine, who was the best smiley staff ever.
5
You will spoiled for choice with this amazing buffet of Malay, Singaporean and Indian food. Food is done well and all are delicious. Many items are prepared or grilled right in front of you. Save room for dessert - that's a whole buffet on its own
4
Fresh Buffet style eating with foods from across the Straits of Malacca. Addition of sushi and steamed/boiled prawns was new since my last visit. Fairly priced for Singapore considering it's all you can eat. Recommend to start slow and not to fill up on the breads or rice
5
Food was fantastic! Service was great! Went there with a Friend and we had a blast. Looking forward to visiting again
4
Delicious buffet with Singaporean food with Indian Malay and Chinese cuisines. Great option and very good quality. Only thing is you can't get a drink! Well worth a visit.
4
We had a table of 8 people for dinner, so saw a good cross section of the food on offer, and got a feel for the venue.Firstly, the venue. It was quite busy when we were there, because as a Halal venue it also attracted people who were breaking fast. It meant it was a little bit hectic, & was not as classy as some buffet venues around Singapore. The service was a bit slow (getting water, clearing the table) and some of the dishes were taking a little while to be replenished.The food however was great, with the Indian kitchen probably the highlight. In addition, there was good variety across the board, with the seafood excellent, some great local & Malay dishes, and some very nice Chinese. Being Halal, no alcohol is served, so fresh juices or tea are the way to go. Parking vouchers were offered to guests who had used the hotel carpark. So if your focus is food rather than the environments, StraitsKitchen is a good choice. If you want a more refined & classy atmosphere, there are better options in some of the other major hotels.
4
Varied menu with food options for people from all over. Plenty of vegetarian fare for breakfast and easy stations to select from and self serve coffee as well. Convenient, good tasting food - reasonable prices for location. Casual, affordable
4
And amazing array of exotic treats for dinner, seems quite authentic and everything we tried was delicious and well prepared. This buffet went way beyond the usual for few simple ethnic choices of food. The service staff members were somewhat dismissive though and dessert selections we're extremely limited
4
It would have been nicer if there is more traditional kueh-kueh added during the breakfast ramadhan.
4
One of my regular visits when the cravings kick in.Great Indian spread. Its a buffet by itselfGreat chicken rice and duck.Good live noodle stationDecent Malaysian cornerGood satayFor me it is always to polish off with a hot goreng pisang and 2 scoops of the coconut ice cream. Then durian ice cream.Heavenl
5
Straits Kitchen has a great wide selection of Singapore's food culture. Food was simply amazing and the staff were very friendly and attentive to detail.Kudos to the team and the wonderful staff behind the service. Cheers and all the best
4
There were wide selection of straits food. The popiah and laksa deserved mention. The ice cream is a must to try with the exotic flavours. Best to keep some space for desserts and kue2.
5
The spread of food never fails to impress me. I am very impressed with the Hainanese Chicken cooked just right for perfection. As usual wide spread of deserts available
5
It was for an overseas farewell for an expat colleagues of mine and the experience was such a pleasant one. It is the best ever halal buffet restaurant I've ever had! Great variety of food and was delicious. Staff around was friendly and quick to attend to us despite it was a crowded Friday evening
5
I was staying at the Grand Hyatt and a friend recommended that StraitsKitchen as a great restaurant in the area. I only got down there for breakfast but the selection of food was great as was the service.
3
I don't fancy buffet local food but i Went there for a work dinner. Average food, lack of variety & bad price. The food served, you can find at a hawker with better taste. The dessert was the worst, taste does not represent local/asian food.Dried & hard.Well, it was my 1st & last experience at Straits kitchen
5
Man, we just got back home and my family is still fantasising about the breakfast spread here, 5 star food, the hokkien chinese, Indian, malay, juice bar, bakery, all were out of this world, they also made fresh to order, congee with anchovies, stir fry, the siew mai, the dim sum, the ice kachang, masala omelettes, the roti chanai, 5 on 5 for the spread, cleanliness, quality, we spent 8 days at the hotel, everyday, there was something new, amazing! The wait staff, were super, at times a wee bit untrained ( they cleared utensils even before i was done), but were always polite , service with a smile, we even went for a la carte meals at 3 pm, my wife still raves about the prawn noodle soup she had and one occasion, we also tried the afternoon buffet, that was super!!! Awesome spread, great value for money, cant wait till next time folk
3
The quality of the flavors are terrific, but there is not a single premium item offered. The most premium item on offer were shrimps, and they weren't the better quality types either. Tons of chicken, vegetables, and carbs. Sure, the food tastes great, but in terms of value, it's pretty bad. You can get much higher quality food at various local restaurants for the same price or less. Swissotel has a local buffet that's priced about the same but with much higher quality food items, plus, there's terrific discounts if you have an Amex Platinum card. I still don't understand the price tag that comes with the StraitsKitchen buffet. Also, I'm not sure if it was a regular thing, but the atmosphere was ruined by groups of unruly tourists causing long lines for the buffets and they were walking around incessantly and taking pictures of/with literally everything. One of the worst experiences I've ever had; definitely not what I would've expected from the Grand Hyatt
5
If you are an Asian food lover like me then the food at straits kitchen would blow you away. Fantastic Indian cruisine is served as well as other local favorites and a sweet ending with the various local desserts and Montana keys.. Yummy!
4
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 3 nights and had breakfast here for 3 mornings. The foods were delicious and with good variety. They served Chinese, Western, Indian and local Singaporean dishes. The first two breakfasts we experienced very good and prompt service, but the last one the service was lousy. Seems it was a very busy Sunday morning. I love the fresh juice and Chinese foods spread including their porridge
5
Top Asian Food Experience! A must visit when in Singapore, as to experience different kind of Asian cuisines coming from the wider geographical area
5
We had a great evening with business colleagues arranged courtesy of our hosts. The flavour and variety of eating was a fantastic way to explore, Thai, Malay and Singaporean food. Highly recommend. Sadly I cannot comment on the price, as this was covered by out hosts, but I would happily return.
5
Good food variety plus (and this is a huge PLUS!) very nice and friendly service. There were two very tired (of walking all day long) and very hungry travelers entering this lovely place at 6:45pm. There were two very refreshed but very tired (of decision making of what eat next) people leaving this place at 8pm.
5
It's hard to dine out with allergies. Straits Kitchen was very accommodating. I emailed them ahead of time with regards to my child's multiple food allergies. They were very responsive and accommodating. This will be another go to restaurant when we head out to eat as a family.
5
Fish is freshChicken and duck roasted to perfectionWide variety of Malay and Indian cuisine Wide variety of deserts and ice cream Fine selection of tea and coffeeFree flow of juicesGood service

Come for one ....Asian Hawker Food ,,,,,and see all of it congregating in Straits Kitchen ...I mean ,,food ....glorious Asian street food , from Chinese ,Malay ,Indian to Pranakan , they are all there , so if you have a visitor from overseas ..this the place , old friends and kaki gathering ..this the place ..food are the kind you grow up with , everyone knows how to spells it and pronounce it... no need to be pompous and pretentious ...food taste as it should be and surrounded by nice serving waiters and waitresses ...for its food simplicity , intent and content ...a 4 for me.
5
My boyfriend and I had a blast while dinning in StraitsKitchen. First of, the service crews were really friendly and nicer, making the extra effort to ensure that customers are comfortable. Also, there's a wide range of local food for people to choose from! Not forgetting the fact that it was delicious and it was really a good experience. Thank you team!
5
Visited for their buffet lunch for $52. They have a really nice spread of food which will fit all asian tastes. Highly recommend their indian food and fried carrot cake. Their mango pudding is exceptionally nice. Didn't like the celery juice very much. Probably good for my health but didnt appreciate it as a drink. The rose drink more than compensated for it though
5
Stayed at the hotel and had breakfast each day. Plenty of options and very comfortable. The design means that don't feel like in a big hal
5
We had a good time as we dine in StaitsKitchen, as we find their buffet to have a variety of local food to try. And we find it very affordable as they offer freshly squeezed juice and the local "Teh Tarik", is a must to try!! The sevice is good also.... thumbs to this team
4
A fantastic selection of food, Singaporean, Malay and Indian. All the dishes look and taste amazing and are freshly made. To many dishes to mention, just go and sample them all. Highly recommend buffet style dinning experience
5
StraitsKitchen at the Grand Hyatt Hotel is our favorite place to bring family and friends to sample the best of Singaporean food in the comfort of a 5 stars hotel service and setting.The restaurant has a buffet style of lunch and dinner for food from India, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, and local Singapore, systematically arranged in each station showcasing food freshly made with a wide range of varieties from satay, prawn mee soup, chicken rice, laksa, to rotie prata. It also has a juice and drink station, and an impressive desserts station. The place is a fine dinning version of Singapore hawker food but yet it's in a casual vibe. Dinners are generally happy to see the varieties and be able to choose and eat to their heart contend in an air conditioned and nicely decorative setting. Service was friendly and attentive during our visits.Don't forget to order a Teh Tarik to finish your dinner. It's very nice
4
They have a good variety of food. The Malay cake and other dessert is really good. Try the roast duck. And dont forget to have the durian and coconut ice cream
5
Very good buffet spread restaurant where you can try Chinese, Indian, and Malay cuisine. You'll have a good experience seeing chefs preparing some fresh food in the middle of the restaurant. This is a must have experience in Singapore
3
There are plenty of choices of food to eat here, including some dessert and different varieties of Singapore cuisine. It is, However, I think that the quality of the food is just average good and nothing specia
2
I was on a visit in Singapore. So I wanted to invite some of my friends for a dinner. As somebody mentioned that the Straitskitchen has a buffet dinner I went through the reviews. There were good reviews and very bad reviews. But I took the risk.We altogether eight persons got one long table even though we asked for a round one. The waiter told us that their round tables accommodate only maximum seven persons!!!We had less contact with the waiters but, they appeared very friendly.The Restaurant is clean, quiet and spacious.Different types of juices and food preparations of different countries were there. The dishes were always with enough items.If you are looking for plenty of eatables you will be happy here.But if the taste is important for you it would be a disaster. Remember, this is not a cheap restaurant. For about 73 SGD per person one should expect some minimum quality. We have tried different Items. None of the items was mentionable.Tandoor is a part of the Indian kitchen and tandoori preparation is famous for its special taste. So we tried Tandoori Chicken too. But nothing special. I hope the Indian Tandoori Cooks excuse.If one is not familiar with tasty cooking please forget this review
4
Good buffet spread - taste of Singapore all in one place. Friendly service staff even surprised us with a complimentary birthday cake.
5
Good local food & superb staff service. A good place to spend our monthsary celebration! Will come back again
5
nicely deisgn for sunday BRUNCH Menu ..very pleasant service ...live station cooking is Really the best part of brunch ..international spread buffet ,\noodlte to tapad ,Briyani
5
Yesterday, I was with colleagues for lunch at the Straits Kitchen. There is good spread of local delicacies and the atmosphere was lively too! Service too was very attentive.
5
We were first introduced to this restaurant by a family friend and have not looked back since. Such local favourites as roti prata, chicken rice, popiah, satay and muah chee are lovingly prepared by top-class chefs. The service is excellent and the ambience is terrific for postprandial conversation. So proud to see the strengths of the cuisine of my home country being showcased at the Grand Hyatt. Majulah Singapura
4
The usual thing to do in Singapore would be to stroll around the streets for some local Singaporean food but if you're the type that likes to stay in your hotel and just relax, this would be the place for you. Things to look for here are the curries, you wouldn't want to miss out on those
4
I cannot think of any other hotel buffet that focuses on the diversity of various cultures in Singapore. StraitsKitchen brings hawker food to a whole new level and it is a great place to sample the different cuisines without having to sweat it out at the usual hawker centers. What a genius concept! Great for a reunion, for tourists who can't bear the heat outside, and for celebrating. The ambience is versatile and suits any occasion.
4
The Asian spread was splendid! Am so in love with the satays and Nasi Padang dishes. We disnt get to try most of the foods because we were too full! I made a special request because it was my bf's birthday. Didnt expectvthe staff to surprise with a cake as special requests are subject to availability.Great food, great atmosphere and the staff were ever so nice
4
Today some stalls didn't put the food listing. Example: Chinese stall. It's good to put the food listing so that for those have food allergy know what they are eating
4
The service and crews are friendly and prompt. Food selections a bit very limited. Indian station food tasted the best
5
One of best place to enjoy local food in singapore....good service & great atmosphere...the chilli crab was fantastic
5
Tonight we celebrated my partners birthday here and it was just fantastic. The food was outstanding with an excellent variety the service was warm and friendly. Not your typical buffet as in western stuff and that's why it was excellent. Highly recommended next time you are in Singapore.
4
Beautiful spread. excellent choice. Good service and value for money for what it offers. Will definitely come again
5
Excellent selection of Asian taste
Wide selection of desert
Good tea and coffee selection
Attentive staff
5
This is one of the main place I look forward to when I come to Singapore! The buffets at StraitsKitchen. Fabulous juice bar!The managers always welcoming and helpful. Had 2 very helpful, friendly staff Dashku and May! Makes the whole dining experience very pleasant! Well done!
4
Wide variety of food. Continental and Asian cuisines. Tasty. If you are a great eater, start your buffet from beginning till the end. Enjoy the food slowl
3
The food was average, too much Indian and curries selection. The carrot cake was done too soggy. Too little desserts and cakes selection. The Mian Jian Kueh was cold and hard, which was a let-down. The Muah Chee & other kueh were not bad. The chicken and chicken rice were excellent.
4
Different varieties of choice from Chinese to Malay to Indian and others. Not much of seafood choices especially cold dishes. Standard of food have decline over time.
2
Why do people even bother with this place? Nothing was good. The roast duck was dry; the horlicks flavoured ice cream didn't taste like horlicks; the latte was bad; the fried rice was sub-par; the indian food was too heavy handed with the spices; the roti prata was dry; the fried kway teow was not authentic; the satay was bleak; the peanut pancake was too hard...the list goes on. If anyone is thinking of having sumptuous food at this restaurant, do not bother. Save your money and make a trip to a food court instead
4
Basically it's a glorified hawker center with all the Singapore classics, from popiah to chicken rice to chilli crab - at one (high) fixed price, with fancy waiter service. Everything was good (though even with tools we could NOT penetrate the shells of the crab). Drinks are definitely expensive - it's no bargain - but for a fancy sit-down local food experience, it does the trick
4
We brought the family for dinner buffet to celebrate my dad's birthday. We loved the warm welcome, hospitality and service rendered by all the staff. Details were looked into even for my toddler. Prior to making a reservation we had mentioned we require a baby chair and some space for a stroller. It was well catered and even plastic cutlery laid out for my kid. The complimentary birthday cake for my dad was served together with a cute birthday song by the staffs. Food was good and replenished promptly. Thou felt the variety was limited, no complains; food was flavorful and tasty
5
Very tired so decided to eat at our hotel, The Singapore Grand Hyatt, tonight. What a wise decision for us. We just experienced a supper at the best buffet we have ever eaten at! The had so many kinds of Singaporean food and every single dish was superb! My favorite was an amazing curried butter chicken. Tender with just the right mixture of spices. I ate so many things. And each was better than the one before it. Despite being a buffet, the ambiance was quiet and we never felt rushed. The food was presented in a way that was exceptionally appealing. We had incredible service for a young woman, Dushku. She was amazingly attentive. Because I was on crutches, she went around with me and carried my plates. She explained what each of the dishes were and what the ingredients went into them. She even introduced me to the individual chefs and the Maitre d', also a lovely person. A bit later, she came back to my table and asked which dish I liked the best and if I'd like any more of it? She also brought me extras of my newly discovered favorites. What kind of a buffet has service like that? All in all, I ate twice what I'd normally eat and because of the service, had one of the best evenings I've ever had in a very long time. And the buffet price was very reasonable too.I'll be going back for sure! Thank you StraitsKitchen
5
My wife and I made reservations at this restaurant based on a recommendation. We were not disappointed. The cuisine selection was extensive. Every major food group: Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Indian was represented. It's definitely a foodies delight and it's an unlimited buffet meal. I used to live in Singapore way back when and every dish I ate as a kid was available, and brought back good memories. Both my wife and I still dream of this dinner. And we made good friends with two Singaporean ladies seated on the table next to us, and stayed at the restaurant eating and chatting for over 3 hours. There was no pressure from the restaurant for us to finish up our meal. First class
5
Loved the variety of food. The laksa was the best. It was great that they had a popiah station. Would come again
4
Tasty straits comfort food with high quality ingredients. The staff are the Kitchen's greatest asset. It was a festive atmosphere for CNY.
4
A wide range of cuisines here, so there is probably enough to please virtually everyone. Buffets can sometimes get tired, but that didn't seem to be a problem when I visited, as staff were diligently avoiding that. I chose mostly Indian dishes, all of which I enjoyed. Staff were attentive and helpful but the atmosphere had a bit too much bustle for my liking. Not a problem if you're a member of a big party. but probably not a good place for an intimate dinner
4
Great selection of local Singaporean tastes on offer. The restaurant itself is very busy on weekends, so service was a little bit on the rush side. Nice decor but requires some timely refurbishment
4
Nice restaurant located inside the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore. The breakfasts provided plenty of options for even the very picky eaters (like myself) to those more willing to try the local flare.
5
I would like to extend my gratitude to all the restaurant team members for their excellent service. Initially i had made a dining reservation at a competitor hotel nearby but due to lack of service which i do not want to mentioned here, i have decided to book at straits kitchen and I did not regret one bit. Reservation was a breeze. The food was amazing. Staff were attentive n professional even though the restaurant was very busy due to Valentines Day. Celebrated my partner's birthday n was presented with a complimentary cake n staff sang a song for him. I also observed the service rendered to the other guests were also excellent. Thank you very much and we will definitely be back n recommend the restaurant to our family n friends.

Good commercial idea: (a) Singapore hawker dishes served in air-con environment (satay, biryani, popiah, Hainanese chicken rice, char kway teow, durian ice cream, etc); (b) it's all halal. So they capture two target client groups (a) out-of-town guests who want a quick overview of Singapore street food in a comfy environment, and (b) Muslims going to a place they can trust. Although you can have the same dishes better cooked and at lower prices elsewhere, overall it's still pretty good here. Sadly, recently they have eliminated some typical dishes, eg. prawn mee, laksa, roast duck, etc. Locals would not be keen because of the high price, the absent wait staff, and the receptionists who can be quite snotty.
5
With four traditional South East Asian cuisines on offer, Chinese, Indian, Malay and Peranakan, this buffet style restaurant is bliss. I have coeliac so I was a little worried walking in but when I told the waiter he went and got the head chef for me who cooked my a set menu and then walked with me around all the stalls letting me know what I could try. The service made this place even better, definitely worth it! I ate so much it was hard to walk after. Delicious
4
We have been visiting this place for five years or more. it is an impressive Halah resturant for our Muslim friends. A sumptuous selection for visitors who wants to sample Singapore's local food, from Chinese, Indian, Malay to Peranakan cuisines. It also offers a good variety local desserts, fruits, fruit juicy, coconuts, plus self service high quality coffee and tea at the same price as it started, $52++ Highly recommended if you do not have the time to visit the local hawker centre
1
Just left the place after my lunch n very disturb with one of the staff attitude. There were a big grp of foreign workers having lunch too at straits kitchen. When I went to take my food at the Malay food section just next to the satay section, I had to wait for them to take their food n then take mine. While I was taking my food this indian lady staff keep grumbling n saying it loud (I say loud cause I can hear it) that the foreign workers take the food like never see food n dirty the area while taking the food. I try making eye contact with the staff but she was busy grumbling n walking around topping up the food. My point here is the foreign workers r not eating for free n maybe this is their first time to such a buffet treat. Passing such remarks r not only looks bad on the staff but also on straits kitchen where it shows how much the staff r being train to be good when providing service.
5
Excellent spread of local delight & asian fare. Good for family/friends gatherings. Will definitely be back again.
5
All types of asian and south asian food in a buffet. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was attentive.
4
I had a breakfast at this place, great variety of foods. They also offered me Hash Brown on request though it was out of menu.

We wanted to visit The Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt Hotel, and informed the hotel that our daughter was anaphylactic to wheat, eggs, dairy, sesame seeds, nuts and shellfish. Her anaphylaxis is so bad that she has been hospitalised on three occasions eating out and as a result we bring her own specially prepared meal, plates and cutlery when we travel or dine out. We have visited many restaurants and hotels around the world, and once the situation is explained, everyone has been happy to accommodate our special needsUnfortunately The Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt were unsympathetic to our special needs and would not allow us to bring any outside food into the premises. Whilst it is the Hotels right to dictate the rules on their premises, we were disappointed that a venue such as a Five Star hotel would refuse the special needs of a guest. This was the first time that our request has been refused. The Hyatt obviously value their own profits rather than the safety and comfort of a guest. We never did dine at The Straits at The Hyatt. Instead we dined at other wonderful restaurants in Singapore which were very understanding and helpful with our special needs. Thanks to The Ritz Carlton, The Fullerton, The Marina Mandarin, The Marina Bay Sands, The Mandarin Oriental, The Fullerton Bay, The Pan Pacific and The Shangri-la for meeting our needs and providing fantastic service. If you have anaphylaxis, I would recommend avoiding The Hyatt.
4
Great place for local food. Love the chicken rice. A must try dish! Place is huge enough to hold crowds. The food top up are also quite fast. If you are a local foodie, this place is good. However, to me, as local food are very filling, after awhile, I cannot eat anymore. The deserts are also nice. Goreng pisang & muah chee are good. The wait staffs are also very prompt in clearing plates. Generally it is a nice place
3
This is a walkabout buffet with a rich assortment of local specialties, halal, well displayed, tasty and with fine selections of all foods. We had a nice family meal for 6 persons. At paying for a meal that reached $500 we inquired about the additional $17 which was charged for 2 coconut drinks. The cashier Aimee of Korea was probably the most sneery, aggressive and unpleasant we have encountered in a food establishment any where in the world. We were glad to leave. Too bad for a good food establishment. lets have a cheer for better cashiers to make the clients socked with large bills feel better about their experience and out with sneery cashiers...or more positive customer service training please...
5
A must go if you love South East Asian food. If I feel very hungry on the day, I would love to come here for buffet. From curries to satays to popiahs to chili crab to local sweets, everything you name it, and the quality of the food is very good
3
The tables are very close to each other... very disturbing when the other person beside you is taking or munching away... that's the only disappointment i had for my anniversary dinner with my wife.. Other then that the food was very tasty and flavourful especially the chicken rice..
5
The spreaad is enough to make you full for sure. This is a buffet spread for SE Asian food, and every food tastes authetically great! The service is on point and attentive. It is halal and definitely worth a visit with your entire family
4
This is a wonderful concept restaurant with a superb selection of all kinds of dishes at various stations. Consider it a high-end hawker experience, more elegant and curated, and the variety and quality are excellent. Pace yourself and take small portions so you can try all the great dishes showcased here. And it's very good value to boot
5
Our family had our New Year's Eve dinner here and we love the spread. The food is tasty, especially for local dishes. The spread is also great. Lastly, the Waiters and waitresses are attentive. There's live band singing during the countdown. Would recommend people to come here for their New Year countdown. The price is SGD138++ for non alcohols and SGD188++ with free flow of alcohol drinks.
5
This restaurant was packed when we had lunch here on Thursday before Christmas. The buffet is amazing if you like local food: chicken rice, noodle soups, Indian food, satay etc. Dessert included durian ice cream and other flavors, ice kachang, kueh, and more. Everything was delicious! I will definitely be back
4
Came here with my wife for her birthday celebrations, entire experience was a pleasant and an awesome one.In terms of food there is a wide variety of local foods served, starting from traditional malay dishes, Chinese styled food, Indian cuisine. Taste of the foods were very nice and food were topped up promptly. The buffet is live kitchen styled where the food is cooked right in front of you and topped up freshly.Best among all is the surprise that the bunch of staff members presented us with a birthday cake and sang the birthday song. I never expected this. We were shocked and it was an awesome extra mile that the crew went to make our day a memorable one.Definitely recommend and be returning to this place.I want to recognize Hank for his prompt, kind and pleasant service in attending to us and our table, and for the group of birthday singers Vasu, Angie and Hank as well. You guys did an amazing job. Keep up the good work
5
Food here never disappoints. Family favorite dinner place. Servers are friendly & attentive. We were given a small complimentary cake as we celebrated my mom's birthday
4
My family and I are regular diners at this famous restaurant as we like the good food and good service most of the time.However two days ago the poor attitude of some rude staff marred our otherwise pleasant lunch.It started with the usher who showed us to our table who showed her displeasure when we requested for a change to another. When we thanked her for her extra effort she just walked away.The worse was the Chef in the Chinese section serving the roast and chicken rice which is our favourite station.We arrived at the station as 1st customers. The Chef was busy cutting the duck, ignoring us (as usual). We stood there patiently waiting for him to be ready. Finally we told him our request and asked for additional portion, he just threw the plate on the table and barked at my family member who is after me as if we were beggars.It is such a shame as the food is delicious as always, with many different authentic local cuisine, the ambience casual and lively.It is one of our family's choice dining place though this is not the 1st time we experienced poor attitude from the Chef but this time he was outright rude. As a popular renowned restaurant in a 5 star hotel, the service attitude needs to be improved.
4
Food is fresh and cooked right in front of you. Only thing is that the price has been going up steadily over the years so i reserve visits for special occasions
5
Visited Straits Kitchen during my stay with Hyatt Singapore. Excellent breakfast spread - and ample of options for vegetarian
5
Had a very enjoyable dinner with some friends. Many, many choices of cuisine. Recommend you cruise all the stations at least once to acquaint yourself with all the selections. Everything we tried was great

First, the booking process. Should you decide to cancel the booking two days in advance of your date, there is no charge for the cancelation. The staff alerted me also to the No Show policy. The final payment can exclude one or two who did not turn up but not more than that. Above that, you are required to pay for the absentees. I would suggest you book for fewer than the actual figure instead so as to take into account one or two of your friends who may betray you at the last minute due to some exigencies. Second: The restaurant would not let you in until it is exactly 6.30 pm. Even when we told them we would just sit in the restaurant and only commenced our dinner at 6.30 pm, the staff still adamantly rejected our request.Third: The layout. I like the `romantic' dim lighting ambience and the fine decorative finish of the restaurant . We were allotted three round tables right in front of the kitchen area. During the booking process, I told the manager that we are coming for some sort of team bonding and she was glad that we chose this restaurant. I was subsequently notified that they would reserve dining tables for us. It would be ideal if they could let us have the rectangular tables so that we could have better bonding and reach out to every one. The round tables tend to restrict our conversation among members of each table. So, it defeats the purpose of team bonding. We requested for the long tables but was told that they have been reserved for others. I think it would be better customer service if the restaurant could let us make the option earlier during the booking process instead of giving us the round tables. The restaurant management may have their own consideration and we are not so petty over such trivial matter. Nevertheless, the manager extended his card to us and asked us to call him directly should we make our booking in future and he would definitely look into our needs. I would like to commend that `korean' girl who served our tables. She was quick to clear our finished plates and was pleasant and cheerful. She approached my Muslim friend if he required a room to pray before the dinner. Such little gesture spoke well of her and my Muslim friend was touched by her little gesture. Fourth: the food. A wide varieties of local flavor: Indian, Malay, Chinese cuisine. There is no salmon or tuna or raw seafood here. This is not international buffet but straits (local) flavor. If you think this is another Carousel just across the road, you are wrong. It is Straits kitchen. I particularly found the lamb mutton tender and the satay appetizing. There were so many food to taste that I missed out some of them as my stomach could not accommodate further. The counter chefs were courteous and friendly. One chef made the popiah for me and asked me if I would like some rojiak served by another chef. Chendol, ice kachang and durian ice-cream all for my sweet tooth and made good desserts. There were plenty of kueh kueh delicacies that I missed out. It would be ideal if there are local taste curry fish heads.For those who have not tried the local food, they would be delighted to have all those dishes. To the locals who have tasted many of such dishes, it did not really appeal to us as extraordinary. Nevertheless, the ambience is good and we had a long interactive sessions while tasting our food. The location is convenient and complimentary car park coupons (valid for four hours) were also given

StraitsKitchen at Hyatt Singapore focuses on Singapore's local cuisine/ fare. From the usual western fare (you'd get for breakfast), to Chinese Dim Sum and Indian Naans and Curries, you'd be spoilt for choice.Hotel buffets will never be cheap by comparison to Singapore's hawker food/ food courts, but you pay for quality of food and ambiance within a 5-star hotel.Still a nice place if you need to host overseas delegates, but do choose a quieter corner
4
We tried the dinner buffet. Straits Kitchen is managed extremely well. The reservation was hassle free, the location convenient, the decor tasteful, the staff prompt and courteous and the food was delicious. There is a wide spread of food to choose from and all of it is well made. The f&b staff are prompt to respond to a customers's needs. The desert spread is not bad but could be better.
3
We had a pack of 7 and i request for a corner long table. I was given a long table and a cosy corner which was perfect for 7 of us as it is really a corner to ourselves. The food varieties was quite limited but nice. However, the prawn and crab served on that day wasn't fantastic. The prawn was difficult to de-shell. The pepper crab the meat was not tender. Texture was rough and had to peel off the meat off the shell. Other then that, the service was good, ambiance was great for a gathering.
5
We have been to this restaurant many times, and have never left disappointed. The restaurant offers a buffet dinner - there is something for everyone. Do try their local deserts, which are of better quality than those you often find in other buffets. They have an spread of Indian, Chinese and Malay
4
This place is popular with locals for variety of Asian dishes served buffet style. It is quite busy during meal hours, therefore it is advisable to book your table. It offers Asian food of good quality.
5
We have had lunch in straits kitchen twice this week while at a training course in the hotel.This place is all about choice, multiple open kitchens with different Asian cuisines. The most impressive thing about Straits kitchen is that with the vast amount of choice on offer, a high level of quality is maintained across all dishes.I would highly recommend Straits kitchen to someone as a fantastic introduction to Singapore food culture, for either lunch or dinner. I have no hesitation saying it is the best conference buffet lunch I have had anywhere in the world.
4
Straits Kitchen is a great way to fuel up for the day. Good Asian and Indian choices. Coffee machines are awesome and the fresh fruit and veggie juice bar is a nice addition
5
This is a nice onsite restaurant. Long stretch of breakfast buffet with bunch of options for every taste. Highly recommen
5
Love the place! Nice ambiance.. really great food from different cuisine. Display and food arrangements are interesting too. Truly enjoyed our time there though Its abit pricy but worth it. Its also convenient for special occasions and gatherings!
4
Straits Kitchen serves food that is normally found in the hawker centers. There's Malay, Indian, Chinese and local desserts. The food is authentic. Ingredients used are better quality than what one would find in hawker centers. There's also more meat and vegetables instead of being carbohydrate heavy. Whilst one can find better cooked versions of each dish at individual well known hawkers, this is information available only to the locals. For selection and comfort (air-conditioning and comfortable seating) this place is the best.
3
Short selection of western and asian dishes. While tasty, there was nothing special about the restaurant.
5
Nice restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Excellent buffet or order off the menu. Relax and enjoy.
4
Thank you for making my best buddy Birthday an awesome one. Will bring my family down next. My favorite was the pisang goreng and most of the food there. Well defiantly come back
1
Went with a group and basically it's a buffet set in a bare wood filled room.Although the place is overrun with staff non appear to be too well trained. Ask for a drink and you will be told " I'll be straight back with that" only to wait and wait and wait some more. However the moment you place anything on the table someone is straight away clearing it for you regardless of whether you may want it.The ambiance is loud due to all the bare timber. Food is served buffet style with different types at separate service stations but as with most buffet it is generally cold and lacklustre. For the cost S$70 ++ there are many many places in Singapore where you can have a far superior experience.
5
Straits Kitchen is one of my favourite place for buffet lunch. Excellent Asian food of high quality. Service is impeccable. Plus the location is so convenient right in the heart of Orchard Road. It is one of the few good place serving Halal food especially when I want to invite my Muslim guests whether there are in town for business.
5
It is one of the best buffet in town with dishes almost all around the world served here. Great variety, you can not eat all
4
The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Grand Hyatt and serves good food.It is easily accessed from the main street and good connectivity to all parts of Singapor
5
Right from the point of tele-reservation till the moment we leave the restaurant everything is perfect!Buffet & service are both delightful
4
Straits Kitchen is one of the best local style buffets in Singapore. they have a Chinese station, Malay station , indian station, large sweet station and other stations . food is very good quality and the setting is also really nic
4
Singapore and HK buffet lunches at 5* hotels are akin to food stations on steroids - everything you can possibly expect in East and West cuisines. Straits is akin to CafeToo at the Island Shang in HK where each position is manned by completely proficient chefs. Because it's so popular, it's heaving at the lunchtime period, but fairly quiet for breakfast meetings (menu, not buffet then). Recommendation: if you're a foodie, sit near the tandoor and watch the Indian chefs work their magic. A true treat
5
This restaurant is located at the lobby of Hyatt Singapore. This is a good place for local Singapore food in one location. Recommend the chili crab, though it's messy but yummy. Black chicken soup, rojak, chicken/beef satay. If you are brave enough try the durian ice cream with mango or lychee
4
The moment you walk into this place, it sets you in the mood for happy endings. Was there for their breakfast. The fruits and juice bar was the first to great you. That is what you want to start your day. Great variety of west and east. Service is good too. Only set back is for those who look for real bacon & ham. They do not serve any Pork items at all. But then the variety is enough to compensate for that
5
Noodles are good. Ask anyone of them if you want to go to your room with coffee. They will provide you with a paper cu
5
Food is awesome. They have very good selection of Indian food and you feel at home. If you are non vegetarian then you can enjoy all cousins. I think one should visit and enjoy the food and hospitality
5
Something for everyone here - if you are halal, Kosher, Vegan - anything! Staff are a delight and will go to the end of the world to help you with your weird requests (if you have them!). Perfectly located within the Hyatt for guests or walk in
3
I have to admit the service is very good but the food is definitely not worth $52++. Sugarcane juice, watermelon juice and other types need to pay extra. Some of the soup base food too much msg.
5
Enjoying the food, ambience and service. Family visit us at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, dining here room was made for the baby pram with no fus
2
Food quality was bad and wasn't fresh. The fruits (eventually traditionally supposed to be Super sweet fruits) were SUPER sour (ie those little tangerines). Otah and carrot cake was way too salty. Best saving grace was the popiah which was good. Canned longan was used in the Cheng Teng instead of the dried longans (that was epic, never seen this anywhere but fail), biscuits were not fresh and already a little "lao Hong". Would never come back again.
3
I dined with a local friend at the the main restaurant at the Singapore Hyatt. The food was solid but nothing special. I could have gotten it anywhere. And it definitely lacked ambiance. For a Hyatt, the staff was also surprisingly disengaged with the diners. I wouldn’t eat there again
5
A good mix of Singaporean,Indian, Malay, Chinese food served buffet style with show kitchens in each section. need a booking and is always very busy and very crowde
4
If you have guests and you need a decent spread of local food...this is the place! Laksa, chicken rice, beef rendang and the list goes on but the pepper crab is my favourite! Thanks to the staff too. They are very efficient
4
Not a fan of buffets, but this one was awesome. All of the food was local and delicious. The buffet is basically a glorified Hawker Center, but very well done and in a beautiful setting. The highlight for me was the black pepper crab and 海南鸡饭 (Hainanese Chicken Rice).Horlicks Ice Cream was also awesome
5
visitors to Singapore like to think that local food is best at hawkers' centre but Straits Kitchen proves this wrong. the quality of the ingredients is so much better ( king prawns, crabs, whole fish, succulent chicken/ duck rice, tandoori, so forth ) and it is great value for money. Plus you can enjoy your company instead of the feeling sweaty, lining up, and so hot that you can't wait to leave after the hawkers centre meal
4
Great food but a bit pricey. But convenient all-in-one-place to sample local street foods. Good place to bring visitors from overseas. Halal food a plus
5
This is one of Singapore's top restaurants. The excellence is firstly in the service. Manager Charles, and the team of waiters and waitresses were of the highest calibre. Always friendly and polite, and consummately professional, they created a pleasant atmosphere and ambience in which we could enjoy the food. The food is also world class, and includes many regional dishes. My particular favourites are the carrot cake (no not a cake but a savoury dish!), Sri Lankan crab and the Beef Randang. There are a range of Indian dishes, and also the many wonderful Chinese sweets, ice kachang, sorbets, sherberts and iced creams, There are also some nice fruit juices including Chinese favourites such as sour plum (gives a nice balance of Ying after the Yang of the crabs).For coffee lovers like me there's also nice coffee machine.The area is also very pleasant, with attractive dark wooden furnishings, and the chefs cook in open booths so you can chat with them about their creations.And if you're muslim, it's all Halal!I am from the UK and I wish we had restaurants like this! Go to this restaurant! You will not regret it
5
We were treated to a lunch buffet by my Singaporean niece and what a treat it was! A wide selection of Chinese, Indian, Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine will delight lovers of Asian food in this all-you-can-eat dining experience. From Chinese Rojak to Indian Tandoori, from entrees to desserts, we didn't try anything that we didn't like. Service was top-class and all food were freshly prepared and expertly-cooked or made to order while we waited
4
The best singaporean chicken and satay in buffet. Only advisable to go if you love Singaporean food
5
Outstanding food & service... Variety of Chinese, Malay, Indian & Western dishes & desserts which are High Quality & Mouth-Watering - made freshly in front of your eyes !! Good wine list & a fantastic way to experience what traditional Singapore streetfood in a premium ambience !! My business partner's reaction summed it up... "You brought me to the best restaurant in SG" !
4
Although not cheap, Straits KItchen is at its best when it comes to enjoying your food. Specialising in Malaysian and Singaporean cuisin, this restaurants offers only halal. I love not being tied down by just chicken and beef, but also a variety of other meats, but no pork. The seasoninng is amazing and everything is cooked to the greatest quality. With so many foods to choose from, lovely rendang etc, it was hard to really tailor what to leave for room to eat
4
It had been many years since I'd been here. But on a recent trip to Singapore my boss invited me to join him and his wife for dinner at StraitsKitchen. They must be regulars because the managers came by to greet them and personally seated us. (I'm not used to that kind of attention, but I must say it's very nice!) I enjoy hawker centers and kopitiams in Singapore. The wide variety of food and good prices are the draw for me. Well at StraitsKitchen they certainly have the wide variety. Everything from top notch hokkien fried mee to chicken rice to chili crab and even roti prata is here to enjoy. And everything I sampled was delicious. Needless to say the service was excellent. Not just because my host knew the management, it seemed everyone received top notch service.It is a bit pricey, even for a buffet -- but a worthwhile splurge IMO.This is a great place to makan in Singapore
5
MOUTHWATERING Breakfast Buffet had me in 7th Heaven as I began with a Fruit Juice Cocktail of Cucumber and Celery and Carrot and blood red Beetroot spiked with Orange. OMG! The infusion of powerful vitamins and minerals and anti oxidants really energised me!!! I followed this with Granola and very healthy good cholesterol boosting almonds, hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds, generously topped with low fat Emmi SwissYyoghurt. Bircher Muesli too! My appetite was ready for more! So I went for the Egg Station. I tested the Chef uy ordering one Sunny Side Up Egg and one Easy Over Over Easy Egg. The young Chef passed the test with flying colours. Chicken Sausages, Beef Sausages, Baked Beans and Corned Beef hash too accompanied my eggs. No pork here as the kitchen is Halal. You see, the hotel is owned by HM The Sultan of Brunei. I could not resist the Indian cuisine and so I had Chicken Masala Curry with Thosai and Appom which is a rice flour pancake. Pastries galore too like the ubiquitous Pain au Chocolate and the butter Croissant as well as Chocolate Croissant. Danish pastries as well were most delightful. I simply love to dip my warm croissant into my steaming hot Cappuccino...and then relish the flavor of the buttery pastry with aromatic and slightly bitter creamy frothy cappuccino! Heavenly. Then I devoured ferociously a bowl of steaming hot Noodles with Wantan Dumplings and Tim Sum like Har Kow (shrimp) and Siew Mai made with minced chicken. Mmmmm...I was not sure if I could eat any more but the lure of fresh cut Pineapple, Papaya, Longans and Mandarin Oranges was way too much temptation for me to resist! OMG! Needless to say, I had a very light lunch as I was so full and satisfied with my gargantuan Breakfast. Only a ripe banana. That was all I had for my lunch. Incidentally, the CROISSANTS here are the BEST in Singapore!. Just come here and try some if you doubt my statement. Have it plain or with Honey...Dr. Michael LIm is a renowned Travel, Food and Wine Writer/Edito

Not too bad, but, I was disappointed by the selection of deserts. Too few variety.
For the food, I wish there was Japanese food too.

The straits kitchen-Hyatt Hotel Scott's road Singapore This is a restaurant that stands very well with a local dishes well spread - one can see the diversity of culture living together : credit to the founding father who placed national interest firstOne can taste hainese chicken rice.malay satay .the Indian curry. Peranakan dishes desserts ,fresh fruit juices ,sea food -crab chilly squid fry One has to visit to taste local food and see social atmosphere of singapor
5
With my family, we had wonderful time in this restaurant, great buffet mixed with delicious Indian food and wide range of Asian dishes , you will be in big trouble which food you want to eat?! Everything was excellent also the price was responsible ( 73 for adult 35 for child plus 10%service and 7%GST ) and diffidently was worth it. Highly recommended don't miss it guys , by the way don't forget to order chai karak !
5
We all (12 persons) enjoyed the buffet dinner on Wed. 20 Jul 2016. We were given a table which is like a private dinner. We have always been a fan of Straits Kitchen. Love the place & food (HALAL). We love to have it on Friday but too bad as now they only have 2 slots for weekends dinners which is definitely too short.
5
Located in the Grand Hyatt, Straits is a wonderful buffet if you are looking for a wide assortment and sampling of "local" Singapore tastes. The food is primarily Singapore, Malay, Indian...with some Chinese, too. I explored much of it. The buffet includes a wide array of juice/teas to drink, but not any cola or alcoholic beverages, which wasn't an issue for me...but just to keep you informed. Desserts included local flavors/styles including batter fried bananas, ice cream, etc. Each of the food areas featured a list/board with the names of each dish, although it was difficult to connect the names to the actual dish...so just ask the friendly staff and they will guide you. My favorite was the Indian area...including the accompanying varieties of naan bread
4
Came here with some business colleagues and had a good meal, if a touch expensive Plenty of variety across menu cuisines. Some of the signage was hard to match to dishesA couple of the dishes were challenging to this western palate - specifically the durian ice cream - but well worth the experience Service was good & efficient although not spectacular Given it was all you can eat you should not eat too soon before a visit

@TheKuoKnowsDiners are spoilt for choice when it comes to good quality buffets in Singapore. Just about every hotel - large and small - manages to put on a fixed-price, eat-all-you-like spread.Straits Kitchen is not one of the cheapest. But it is probably one of the best. It specialises in Malaysian and Singapore cuisine - otherwise known as Straits food.The food is strictly halal, which means strictky no pork. But there is plenty of other meats to choose from.The satay is outstanding. The well-seasoned skewers of chicken and mutton and the peanut sauce, which is one of the best I have tasted, makes it hard to resist going back for more.If the stay is outstanding, then the selection of Indian curries and breads is sensational. The Tandoori Chicken was cooked to perfection, with just the right degree of caramalisation. It went well with a piece of Naan bread.With excellent Hainanese Chicken, superb Rendang and even lamb roasted on a spit and many more besides to choose from, it is hard not to sample everything in sight.But try to leave room for dessert. Straits Kitchen is one of the few buffets that offers Pisang Goreng or Banana Fritters. The crisp batter that encases a sweet Raja banana is on a par with some of Singapore's best hawkers - the most notable of which is the stall in Maxwell Food Centre.Straits Kitchen excel in Straits food. There is clear blue water between it and the rest who will need to try harder to close the gap
5
It's a local Singaporean/ Malay based cuisine restaurant at the Grand Hyatt, Singapore. Very cosy, quaint and a peaceful place to dine in with family, or for business meetings, with an array of local delicacies to satiate your taste buds.One of my recommended picks would be the Nasi Goreng.Other fine selections would be Hokkien Mee. A fine bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon with that, and you're truly set for a fine dining experience.Definite thumbs up
5
Superb food & atmosphere!! The food represents the ethnic cuisines in Singapore. Definitely worth the money! Tip top customer service
4
I went for lunch buffet at Straits Kitchen to celebrate my husbands birthday with some of his friends. The ambience is great.. food is nice. Lot of options to choose from.. mediterranean, chinese, Indian.. all were yummy. They also arranged a small birthday cake for my husband. Though i would have liked it if we were asked before getting the cake.. we were still eating main course when the cake was brought.Overall it was nice.. will definitely come back
5
Obliging and willing to try its best to accede to customer's request even if customer is using credit card promotion
5
I am a big foodie and this restaurant hands down is one of the best I have been to. The food and the look of the restaurant is fantastic! Breakfast - Dinner - its extremely elaborate with multi cuisine offerings
4
The Hyderabad briyani was fantastic! The mix of spices was out of this world! Another must try is the tandoori mushrooms and the tender succulent satay. My favourite dessert was the humble kueh dadah-such soft silky skin n moist Gula Melaka coconut. Absolutely YUMMY
5
Delicious! Great restaurant, Great Service, talented chefs with so much variety and options to choose from. Fresh and tasty and caters for the most fussiest eaters!
5
good food, great ambience.. the staff were really friendly and helpful too.. thumbs up for everything
4
Great food, friendly service but very slow with the drinks and bill. Minor issue when the food is so god.
4
Straits Kitchen is the go-to place for us when we have guests from overseas wanting a range of Singapore food. It has remained consistently good all these years. This time ambience was not fantastic as seated right next to the water station and having wait staff chatting next to you as well as stacking dirty plates was offputting.
1
was there last sunday with my family of 6+3 dinner and before finish feeding my 18 months old baby, my nose was very itchy and sneezing, i had sensitive nose but never such happening to me before, i couldnt eat my dinner and feel very sick, having spend 78++ for a person, i felt disappointed all because we were given a far back corner with a hugh big dirty carpet under our table and the massive glass ornaments by the side was very very dusty. I do believe a reputable hotel like hyatt should be very clean conscience, spick and span and looking after all customers and having to spend $ the next day to see a doctor because of this unclean place, i am not sure if i be going back again for the food as even i left a comment on their website on this, they didnt bother getting back to me.
4
Not a buffet person, but got arranged a business dinner here. To my surprise, the food quality is more than what u expect from a buffet. Endless choices, Indian, Malay, Chinese etc, all are delicious, I have difficulties in identifying some food though.
5
You need the whole afternoon if you want to enjoy all the food here. Everything is good, Chinese, Indian, Nonya, Malay, local desserts, or even the cut fruits. They are simply very well done and the quality is fine. The service is good too, staff clear up the used plates quickly and attend to details. All in for lunch is about $68. A bit expensive for local food but the quality is worth it.
4
Great Sunday brunch buffet. The buffet was very large. The seafood was fresh and great massive variety. The champagne kept flowing. Not cheap but is worth the money for the quality
5
In the month of May 2016 went to Straits Kitchen twice. Worth for the money. Food is too good. You can find a lot of Local Delights. Excellent service staff
5
If you are after local food cooked well, this is a great venue to sample a wide range cooked well. It is a buffet, but forget ideas of bland food aimed at foreigners. It is tasty and authentic. There is also an Indian station with excellent Indian food. The juices are also great. The staff were very attentive and can get you bowls of water and those tools for cracking open the crab. Did I mention there is crab? And prawns. But go with an empty stomach so you can try lots of what is on offer
4
If you're staying at the hotel you can't beat the convenience and the food is good. $88 for dinner buffet, $40 for breakfast buffet. It's worth it if you are hungry and have time. Huge selection of food on the buffets. Service was OK, not especially attentive but sort of what you expect at a buffet (they aren't working to earn full tips - mostly just getting you drinks and since I don't drink cocktails maybe I was marked as not worth visiting often). The service was not at all bad so don't over read that comment. Decor is nice, bill came quickly
5
It was a nice dining experience at StraitsKitchen whereby a great variety of Local Delights were being served. Excellent service staff and we had a lovely lunch. Thank you to the restaurant staff for the nice dining time
2
Everything was good until when I went to refill my fruit juice. I saw the Chef smelling into a bottle of unlabelled fruit juice from his fridge. He smell to confirm the juice and then refill into the glass jar for us to take... I nearly throw out all my food. Please label the fruit juice for your people
2
the food is really mediocre at The Straits Kitchen. The best is still only the Indian cuisine. Otherwise I would rather go across to The Carousell for a better buffet spread at that pric
5
We loved having breakfast out there, the spread was great and the food was delicious. You must order the waffles out there, they are amazing. The staff is extemely caring and courteous. Five Stars all the way.....
5
The breakfast is superb…. All kind of international and local Singapore food. Many chefs behind the stall to prepare instant cooking like noodles, fried kway teow, carrot cakes etc. Food are all very freshly prepared….Go early to have the breakfast, bring your favourite books or newspaper, you will not regret. U may skip your lunch after this heavy breakfast….. MUST GO…
5
We invited Business Partners for breakfast over to Straits Kitchen and they loved the food and the atmosphare
5
Good selection of foods from the local Chinese, mainland Chinese, Indian, Malay and Western cuisines. Fresh and tast
4
Had breakfast here whilst staying at the hotel. Good choices. Juices are from a jug rather than fresh (which costs extra). No pork products if that's a thing for you. Very relaxing non stressful buffet and not too bright and shiny and industrial - perfect for gentle mornings.Food was of very good quality, and service pleasant as well
4
Good selection of freshly squeeze juices and local pulled tea. There was congee, noodle corner, curry corner, egg stations and hot dishes. Just that only vinegar and olive oil was available next to the salad. If you want other dressings, have to ask from the chef. Also the bottle of olive oil was very oily and heavy.
3
Good for Malaysian and the curries and puddings were nice but if you want a buffet you are better off at the Shangri-la, which has more choice for about the same price. Beer is expensive.
3
While it definitely achieve its aim as a nonya/Asian kitchen (minus japan/Korean/Chinese), its pricing is way too expensive for a lunch of S$50odd before taxes and service chargeMaybe the good ambience adds the extra that we have to pay. From indian , malay to nonya and Asian Chinese cuisine, you are spoilt with variety. Unfortunately, variety is never a crucial criteria for my evaluation. Its prawn noodles is not intensively flavourful. (Didn't get to try its laksa)While it aimed to make its salad choices Asian, somehow it didn't make us go drooling for them except for the 水翁 salad。Glad that there are very good satays (grilled meat on skewers), steamed chicken, beef(rendang), etcOh ya! not forgetting, the dessert like Fried fritters (better than Singapore Hawkers) and something unique like Horlicks' ice-creamHonestly, I expected more from hyatt! (There is no bbq items as listed on its online menu
4
My family and I were here for Mothers' Day celebration dinner. The food selection was amazing, with the clams and black pepper crabs as the highlights of the dinner. Indian food was very delicious; I had the lamb rack at least twice! The only downside was the laksa, which was so average... Didn't finish it as it was not up to standard.The staff were most helpful without being intrusive. Really enjoyed the dinner and my mom was very happy too!
4
Celebrate mother's day with family. Lots of local cuisine but none of the usual cold seafood spread
5
Great selection of Asian and Western food and very friendly service. Plenty of room between tables for a nice quiet business breakfast
5
I love the robust ambiance and how the food stalls are located in their little segregated areas- the food selection was great and there was alot to choose fro
4
I used this restaurant mostly for breakfast buffet. While the spread is not huge but it does cover 3 dominant cultures in Singapore. 1) Chinese 2) Indian & 3) Western. It is a given you will find these three cuisines there.
5
will definitely revisit again. Food was good but didn't manage to try all. Service crews were proactive too.
3
The waiter had to be reminded 3 times to get the bill. Extremely poor service for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel
5
Visited the restaurant for the first time with colleagues, came in 6 people and got the corner round table. Convenient as there is ample space space for me and others, as to why? We all ate atleast 2-3 rounds. Be it Main course or Desserts. With the photos uploaded, basically we had those of many servings. My favourite would be the salty prawns, yes it might be alittle too salty for some. But im good to settled with that, big fillings and i took that eat time i came to table with mee or rice, or satay. Satay is generous. Chicken and beef was both good but chicken is better as im a chicken lover! Muah chee is available. They would cut into small pieces and we can stir with peanut ourself. And FYI, you can take as much as you want.... ;) LOVE IT! And despite coming few rounds for that, the chef working is always smiling and dont give a certain look.. If you know what it mean...... Indian food, i had naan chicken tandoori. Naan is served hot and chicken with great sauce. What more right? If that 1 dish is well prepared, how about the other 10-12 other dishes that i didnt take.. Right? Icecream if im not wrong was horlicks, coconut, durian that was available at the moment. I had reservations of horlick.. And when the man working suggested that i had some. Yes its nice! I ask for a bowl of it, just 1 big portion. Durian, ermmm not a fan but colleagues said that its yummy. Erm, i cant comment but they had few servings so should be nice. I cant recall much as it was last month, but i can say that the food all is delicious. Well located in the town area. Convenient and the staff working is all smiling always. I would rate this place personally 4.5/5. Do enjoy each dishes and experience my smilling stomach upon stepping out of the restaurant! :
5
I have visited Straits Kitchen six times in the last 5 years, and it's always on my list whenever I visited Singapore. This time I had dinner with my wife and two other friends. The food items this visit was similar to the past, but in addition to the pepper crab, this time there's an addition of stir fried lobster. Really enjoyed the good spread of Malay, Chinese and Indian items over the buffet table. All items were well prepared. I am very impressed with the consistency of food quality and service at Straits Kitchen and I will definitely visit again next time when im back to Singapore.
4
Had no idea of what to expect.. but it was a selection of local delicacies. Food was fine but I guess this would cater more to foreign guests if they wanted to try Singapore food. The ambience, interior and service were definitely up to standard. Staff were attentive amd friendly & even sang happy birthday. :

Had dinner and breakfast here. Staff very attentive.Multiple buffets to choose from with a wide variety of cuisines to choose from. Have the coconut ice cream at dinner
5
Great food, great ambience for catching up with family and friends. Not a place for a romantic dinner
2
The best chicken rice ever! Sadly we were limited to 2 hours and one of the staff was quite rude when 2 hours was up. It was like he couldn't wait to kick us out. It was still early and many empty seats available, however the staff told us that we had to leave
4
The variety of local Singaporean food was good. It's a nice place to bring out-of-town guests who appreciate ambience in air conditioning and are willing to pay more for the buffet
1
The food is reasonably good but ridicoulously overpriced. The place is, messy, noisy (difficult to have a conversation) and the service terrible. Few waiters - who look confused and at their first experience. You need to actually leave your table, find them and convince them to serve you the most basic staff, such as water, fork and knife, etc....For the same price you can have a very different experience in the most elegant and sophisticated hotels in town
4
great resturant. have varieities of foods. price is good too. eas to locate, ideal place for having dinner.
4
If you want to enjoy typical Singaporean food in an upmarket atmosphere it's the right place to be. For a reasonable price one can try out all different food out of the region. The quality of the food is according to a 5 star hotel. However you won't feel formal in this restaurant. The staff is very passionate and helpful. Everything is prepared in front of your eyes, which creates an authentic experience. A reservation is highly recommended and be aware of 2 seatings at night. If you have a chance to spot Mike in the restaurant try to get hold of him. He is the good soul of the F&B outlet of Grand Hyatt.

I and my wife were in Singapore on a short vacation and, one day we decided to have dinner at Grand Hyatt StraitsKitchen. We tried this place once before and expected the same standard this time around too. StraitsKitchen is on the same floor as the reception of the Grand Hyatt and just walked through to the restaurant. The main reason to select this place was the variety of foods included in the buffet dinner. They had unlimited Crabs and large prawns cooked to perfection. When we are in Singapore, we normally go to East Coast for crabs. This time of the year, Singapore was unusually hot, even in the evenings. We decided to skip the East Coast and have crabs at Grand Hyatt, in their air-conditioned restaurant. It was not only the crabs and prawns. They had separate sections for Indonesian, Malaysian and Indian foods. You can decide to stick to one type of food or try all the different food types. We wanted to try all of them. The secret is to serve your plate in small quantities and leave room for several serves. As soon as you finish your plate, it will be removed and you go for another serve. It was a real gastronomic experience for us. Normally food is cheap in Singapore. You can go to a night market and eat all the sea food you want for a reasonable price. Grand Hyatt buffet dinner is fairly expensive compared to night market stalls, but if you are in Singapore, you must try it at least once

Straits Kitchen has a unique set-up indeed. It serves Singapore hawker or street foods in a 5 star hotel setting. As much as I would want to like it, after being there quite a few times, unfortunately in my opinion at least, it's best to venture out there, in the streets to get the real deal! Real hawker food are everywhere in Singapore and I must say Straits Kitchen doesn't have anything special except for its ambiance and it being in the Grand Hyatt. The only consolation I must say, is its coconut and durian ice-cream served in the Desserts section.....
3
This was not my 1st time here. Staff displayed poor body language & double standard btw locals & foreigners. My plates were taken away even though I was not done. In addition, I approached one of the stations and asked about a dish, rather than answer me, the person manning the counter addressed the foreign guest that was behind me. I also brought along my sister who was 11 turning to 12 but was met with a disbelieving look by the reception. This is uncalled for and unprofessional. I would gladly provide documentary proof if requested.Good food but service could be better
4
We were spending one night at the Grand Hyatt before a cruise and decided that we should have dinner at the Straits Kitchen after we check-in. The reception desk clerk helped us make our 8:30 reservation. We knew that with only one day in Singapore at the end of our cruise, there is no way that we could try everything Singapore has to offered. Eating at Straits Kitchen seemed to be the right answer since they really served hawker food at its best. We totally enjoyed trying out all the different ethnic food and son couldn't stop eating the Indian selections. Their Hainanese Chicken Rice was exceptionally good, tender and juicy chicken with flavorful rice. My only regret was that I wasn't hungry enough to try everything. This is the place for quality hawker food
4
Food is nice and good. Lots of local and Japanese food when it for theme of International buffet. Ambience also good. Even when it at peak period, the service still good
4
If you are looking for a five start restaurant with Halal food in Singapore , then this is the place The food is very very good , the portion of Indian food is extra ordinary and the local Singaporean food is also very good , I am sure you will enjoyPrices for a five star hotel is good and the service is also very good
4
It was a business dinner for 3 pax, and we decided on the Straits Kitchen for dinner. My local S'porean colleague made the reservations. The restaurant was cosy and suitable for entertaining clients. The location is also strategic and easy to access via taxis and MRT. The food spread and variety was pretty good and my angmoh guest had an enjoyable experience trying all the different types of Asian food at a single location. Service by the Korean waitress was quick and courteous. I would definitely return to the Straits Kitchen in future
5
Had a great dinner here a couple of nights ago, and will certainly return in less than the 3 years it's been since I was last here. Food quality and variety at each of the open kitchen areas was excellent, and our party of 3 sampled each cuisine at least once between us, with some repeat visits to particular stations! The Indian food was particularly good, as was the Indonesian and Singaporean, but the Chinese and Malaysian kitchens were also wonderful so it was hard to single out a favorite. Service was friendly and good despite the restaurant being full on a Tuesday evening. It's not cheap at around $110 per person including a couple of beers each, but it's very good value for money compared with many other Singapore restaurant meals in the same price range, and I would thoroughly recommend Straits Kitchen as a venue for a different and very flavorful buffet experience for either lunch or dinner
3
Used this restaurant as an trouble free option for eating prior to departure. The surrounding was comfortable and busy. The service was good. The food was value for money
5
I was in Singapore for a week in late January into February and had the pleasure of dining at StraitsKitchen twice. Both of my meals were at Dinner time on a Saturday and on a Tuesday. Went online to Open Table to make a Reservation because I've read that this restaurant gets quite busy. I was lucky enough to get 1st seating on both nights. 30 min. after the restaurant opened, the entire restaurant was filled with people. The price for the dinner buffet was roughly $52 USD. I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for so long and finally had the chance to do so. It was absolutely amazing. There were different action stations that served Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese and Indian dishes. Beef Rendang, Satay, Chili/Black Pepper Crab, Roasted Duck, Popiah, and amazing curries at the Indian station. The food was always fresh and flavors were very authentic. There's also a great selection of juices to choose from as well desserts. The staff is just absolutely wonderful. The hostesses were really kind and the servers were VERY attentive to the dining guests. I was traveling solo, so I usually pay attention to the small details when dining alone. It's nice to appreciate the hard work and care that can easily get overlooked.Thank you so much for a wonderful meal! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes buffets, wants a wide variety of delicious authentic food, enjoys a nice dining environment
3
I can't quite remember that Straits Kitchen being Halal. No pork in the chicken rice section, meaning no char-siew like what I ate in The Line at Shangri-La. Local food served in "posh" manner. Each pax at S$73 for weekend dinner. Seems like no much of an attraction anymore to pay for that kind of spread.
5
We went for the Sunday buffet. There is a very good selection of Indian, Chinese and Malay food. It is all well presented and tasty but maybe there could have been a bit more seafood. The buffet is good value but the wine, as is usual for Singapore is eye wateringly expensive
1
Went for lunch today and were expecting sushi and crabs but there were none. Would not want to come there again. So disappointed.
5
The food was really nice and delicious. Quite a big spread too. Service was really good and efficient.
3
very expensive for what it is, the safe way to discover local cuisine, or if you have guests that you cannot take to the real local hawker store
3
The restaurant is big, clean, and sophisticated. All variations of food, such as Thai, Indian, Chinese, Japanese are available at the buffet, and everything was tasty. Everything was good except for the price, we paid about SGD450 for three people's dining, though each of us drank a couple of glasses of wine. It was a little too expensive for the value provided.
5
Friendly staff, different sections of the restaurant embraces family gatherings, amazing curry corner
2
I die habe expectations but they haven't been fulfilled. I found a sushi bar which only serves long time prepared tuna sushi. Some duck and Indian food (which was if good quality). The fruit bar was rather sad. And the Malay corner didn't have much meat in the dishes.The stuff seemed to be overwhelmed with customers (it did not seem to be fully booked) hence everything looked rather dirty. But well at list the price tag was 5* The way the food had been displayed was not very tempting. Local restaurants do a better job.No recommendation for a special occasion from my side
5
Went here on business lunch as a treat to try out all the flavours of the region in one place. Loved the selection and quality of the food -- even the selection of drinks and juices offers a wild array of flavours I'd never had before. When most of the food courts on Orchard Road are hectic and limit your ability to try everything under the one bill, this relaxing and well appointed restaurant ticks all the boxes. Luckily I was with locals who could guide me through all the flavours and explain the distinctive dishes, otherwise I may have been a bit lost and overwhelmed with what to try.
5
Price: $70+ per pax for dinnerServes: Local food, indian, chineese malay dishesAmbience: Dim lights with simple layoutsdefinitely worth it
5
Went to straits kitchen again after a few year gap. Food was good as usual and so was the variety with good ambience. Recommended if you would like to indulge in local delicacies such as satay, char Kway Teow, rojak, popiah and all the Peranakan kuehs. Though there are Indian and Malay food, it's the local variety which draws people to this restaurant in grand Hyatt
2
Breakfast at StraitsKitchen was noisy and chaotic the day I went. Not a good place to start a day of business or sightseeing. And they don't serve bacon
4
The food standard have been maintained since the last time I ate there. Service staff very attentive as well..
4
That great design by superpotato still looks great after some years and houses all types of cuisine that make Singapore such a vibrant colorful food experience. Lots of locals on a week-end evening, which is always a good sign!
5
Straits is such a perfect restaurant because you can try so many Singaporean dishes there and they are all so good. Everything from the satay to the roti canai is to die for. You have to eat here when you're in Singapore.
4
Located in Grand Hyatt Singapore, makes this restaurant to be considered as a "fine dining" though it's actually a buffet. If you love south-east asian foods, this restaurant can serve you best. Dont try to look for western or japanese, they are not there
5
A wonderful artistically designed restaurant for buffet. Varieties of food and certified Halal food served in this restaurant. There was Indian, Chinese and local Singaporean dishes. I was enjoying the buffet taking the food from different sections which were beautifully presented. The whole ambiance was beautiful. The food was tasty and with good friends around it was just wonderful. Food served were Satay, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Laksa, Tandoori Chicken and Naan, different soups, vegetable dishes and other meat based dishes and of course deserts. Grand Hyatt is a big chain hotel and their style is as usual good. The waiters were too quick to take away the soiled dishes
4
Food was tasty as usual and the service was great! The only setback was that the food was not replenished as quickly as we hoped.
5
This has one of the most amazing breakfast buffets I have ever seen in a hotel. Whatever you are in the mood and your culture they have it for you!
4
We stayed at Hyatt for a couple days with breakfast. Surprisingly never get bored having breakfast here. Almost all food taste good.
4
Mainly presenting local food and the choices were a lot. The given portion is just right and I like almost every selction. If you are a local food lover, you ought to try this and set this restaurant as benchmar
3
We visited this restaurant after reading the reviews, I think it has very good cooking food, but I dis not find the variety of the dishes, starters and the dessert. All these were limited and was difficult for us to try anything. Price is little bit expensive.
4
I really enjoyed the fantastic range of various regional cuisines but was disappointed by the very limited and not particularly enjoyable dessert section
5
It was my first time coming to this restaurant, greeted by the friendly staffs at the counter. The food is delicious and please go with an empty stomach. So much food to choose from. The service staff are excellent and each time our plate is dirty, they will come immediately to clear. Overall it is a good lunch and recommended to all who love our own local foods
5
Represents good value for Singapore at around S$50/ head. Excellent local Singaporean, Indian and Malay cuisine all freshly prepared and you help yourself. Difficult to restrain yourself
5
There's a lot on offer and everything is very flavourful. Maybe too flavourful and heavy for some. I recommend you go for some vigorous exercise beforehand and be positively famished before eat her
4
The ambience is wonderful. The restaurant's decoration is beautiful with in depth cutleries to showcase the diners. A good wide spread of buffets. Definitely, will come again with family
5
The dinner buffet is expensive, but they do a la carte and room service. Very good local food if you have no time or inclination to venture out to a hawker centre
5
As part of th Hyatt hotel the Straits Kitchen Restaurant has a cosy set up with dark wood furnitures and many food islands to go and taste wonderful Asian food. The variety goes from the famous Singapore Laksa to original Indonesian sweets over to Indian food, beautifully displayed in copper plates. Chefs prepare th food freshly right in front of you and it is just delicious. BUT, you need to be really hungry to go there, too sad not to be able to try everything..
5
We are a long-time patron of the GH Spore and stay there more than 10 years a year. But in the last couple of years, we avoid having breakfast at StraitsKitchen. Not because of the food (which as always good) - but because of the service, or rather, the lack of service. Last week we decided to give it another try (simply because there was no table available in the not so grand anyway anymore Grand Club), and .... whow. Heaven. It was like having breakfast in other universe. No endless lines at the entrance, no wait at all , no more unfriendly, chaotic hosts that placed you at table that haven't even been cleaned. Service with a smile, competent, charming, helpful and caring.Soon, we figured out why: A new restaurant manager. Boy, did he turn the place around. Well done
4
Straits kitchen allow we you to sample the delights of Asian food in a wonderful relaxed setting. The food is wonderful and the choices include Indian, Chinese, Singaporean and other south east Asiian fare. They have fresh juices and the food is halal. Must visit.
5
The taste of local is wonderful. Customer service wise they are fast servicing customer's request . Would love to come back soon to eat the most delicious roasted duck . the best thing is it's HALAL !! :
2
Had a very good Mee Goreng at the Straits Kitchen which was $20SGD. Along with a glass of wine which was $30SGD for 250 ml. The glass barely had 5 sips of wine. Quite surprising given what they charge.
3
The buffet serves a wide range of Asian food. I was here with family for a weekend dinner to celebrate a birthday. The food was decent, and is a good place to go if you want to try different types of asian food in one place
3
This restaurant is located in the Grand Hyatt Singapore. This restaurant isn't bad for breakfast...but not much else. The breakfast here isn't bad but grossly over priced. I've never had a concern with the service and the ambience in general is pretty good. However, let's face it, what restaurant in Singapore charging similar prices doesn't offer a comparable ambience. Wit that said, if you make the mistake of staying at the Grand Hyatt Singapore this isn't a bad place for breakfast. However lunch and dinner are maybe best suited elsewhere
4
I stopped by Straits Kitchen for breakfast since it is located in the Grand Hyatt. They have a good variety for breakfast, but each day, I selected one of the local items. Very flavorful and a great start to the day. Only surprise was how the coffee service is so different from what we have in America. It was very good, but sometimes I just want a good cup of plain coffee
5
The buffet here is outrageous! There are counters with food from every Asian country! You could spend hours eating here. The food is fresh and plentiful. I love coming here.
3
Many buffet choices offered in a somewhat chaotic buffet atmosphere, Not fine dining whatsoever,Most selections had menu items; their names. But, the printing on their Card was of a small type making it hard to read.Interesting beverage selections including Rose Syrup, which was good: a drink with a floral aroma.Very good dessert section with lots of delicious fruits and unusual ones as well: Durians and Dragon Fruit as examples.For a guest who has never tried Asian cuisine in Asia, this could be an interesting experience, if one is willing to try new dishes
3
This is the place for people who love hawker food but want to eat in a nice (not necessary quiet) environment...
Since it is in a hotel, expect higher price than hawker center.
5
Wide range of Asian food in a very professional venue. All you can eat probley best buffets I've ever had and I've been to many high end buffets. Was really impressed with the quality of the food and the taste was great. We stayed four hours over conversation and many trips for more plates, was impressed
5
Amongst the best in Singapore and possibly no. 1 for those searching for Halal options! I have been here umpteen times (for both lunch and dinner) and never returned disappointed. Service is best in class with exceptionally attentive staff. Range of Food, juices and deserts are simply too good to be missed
3
Love the setup, as always for Hyatt standard. The chinese food was actually good, even though its halal! But the satay, the dessert were truly a let down. Meat was simply too tough for the satay. And the kueh, was either left on the outside for too long or something. The skin of the kueh was simply too thick. disappointed. Service was ok. There were two things that i must mention. When i called the hotel operator and asked if it is straits cafe or straits restaurant. The hotel staff, with its usual cold tone told me its straits restaurant. But, it is actually straits kitchen! there is complimentary parking, if you drive. But when making payment, the staff never asked, never offered. This is disappointing for a five star top notch hotel. I recalled that i didnt ask, after leaving the restaurant. They gave me readily. Why cant the hotel offera simple service to ask, when the guest is making payment?
5
I think this place is awesome. You get to feast on the specialities of the ethnic groups of Singapore, and it's for a price lower than the other buffets nearby. I particularly love the Tandoori section, and the many curries and spices of the Malay section
4
The Straits Kitchen offered a very good selection of local and regional choices with quick service. Its so popular, that you should get a reservation
4
We have been loyal customers to Straitskitchen. Only ever going to them every time we feel like indulging in a buffet. I would have given a 5 star if the staff were more attentive. The restaurant wasn't full but I had to help myself to clean utensils while 2-3 staff members were hovering at one station. Also, reservation staff over the phone was not as 'polite'. I was told rather impolitely that restaurant was full when I requested to add an additional adult. I was at the restaurant for the full 2.5 hours buffet and there were always empty tables! Food was really good as usual!!! Definitely worth the buck. Plus, kids below 7 eats for free
5
If you are to sample the best local cuisine do give Straits Kitchen a try. A sumptuous buffet spread to spoil even the choosiest of diners. The staffs are polite and efficient. The interior design is cosy and well planned. A good place to entertain or to celebrate special occasions
5
We had a wonderful, classy lunch at this restaurant during the Eidul Adha celebration 2015. My big family, all 28 of us, truly enjoyed the local hawker cuisine buffet from live stations. The food and service were excellent and the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. The whole experience was worthwhile. Everyone loved the delicious Butter chicken, Naan, the popular Chicken rice and yummy Popiah Basah. Free parking and prayer room were also easily accessible
5
I loved this restaurant. Excellent service and the range of Asian food on offer with the buffet was excellent. Great quality, great range and good service.Just being able to have fried rice, dim sum and chilli for breakfast made my entire week
5
You will see very important people here when you are dine here as it seems to be a favourite for hosting ministerial visits etc. So they have a very high standard to keep. Good indian food apart from a wide spread - pretty fine dining.
4
Great range of local food..Indian,Singaporean ,Malay . All served buffet style and all well prepared and just excellent. Would highly recommend although the vegetarian options are limited
3
Had to queue up for breakfast and it was halal only Why is the majority of population discriminated agains
4
There is a great variety of dishes to choose from. Ambience is excellent and service is exceptionally fast. Staff are friendly and helpful. I celebrate all special functions here. It is halal(which is very helpful to me as most of my closest friends are Muslims and it is really challenging finding Halal buffets here) and it is pocket friendly as it costs $45++ per head. However, I am giving this 4 stars as the desserts options are very limited compared to my experience in Royal Plaza on Scotts' Carousell Restaurant. If you are a desserts person like me, Carousell will be a better option for high tea. If you're looking for great dinner, StraitsKitchen is the place.
4
tried the dinner buffer - always wiser to make a reservation. the food spread is excellent and the choice is varied - chinese, japanese, indian etc etc. the ambiance of the restaurant is very pleasing and i found the pricing to be very reasonable. will definitely visit again
5
This is a very special place! Various types and styles of food. All what you want you get there. Good service, little to cold AC for an european :-), but overall very good . Enjoy it 
4
Had a very nice buffet lunch here, the food was excellent and very reasonably priced. Would definitely go again. The staff were also very helpful and friendly with the kids.
4
This buffet covers many South East Asian delights and was delicious. It has a nice atmosphere and has pockets of quiet tables were you are not constantly jostled by people heading to the buffet. It was also quiet so easy to have a conversation. THe popiah and the curry were memorable.
4
restuarant attached to hotel that i was staying in, offeringf a large range of things for breakfast - covers all needs. Service limited to team and coffee the rest is serve yourself No issues, god food
4
Love coming here with friends. Great food selection. Lots of choices and all under one roof. Plus after dinner some nice shopping opportunities on Orchard roa
3
Okay, not much choice but tasty and spicy food: Indian, Chinese ... I would have liked a bit more vegetables. Restaurant is nice, with good decoration
5
Was treated to lunch here while travelling for work. I had asked to go somewhere I could try a selection of local food, and my host didn't want the noise and bustle of street hawkers, so took me here. Not cheap, but the selection and quality of food is amazing. All the local favourites from a satay station, chicken rice, wide range of malay and indian food. Even a drinks station with sour plum juice and rose water. It was great to try so many new foods in a pleasant atmosphere. A lovely splurge. Would recommend to anyone going to Singers for the first time.
4
The best dishes were- chinese chilli crayfish /crab with mantou, fried tunghoon, popiah, indian lamb, malay satay. Average rojak, laksa, fried carrot cake. Enjoyed sago melaka, yam with gingo nuts, sour plum drink. Didn't like horlicks ice cream as found this too milky. Good to go early as queues at food stations become long after 7.30 pm for dinner. No sushi/sashimi station
4
Stayed at the Grand Hyatt so had a buffet breakfast here one morning. Food was plentiful and a good Asian spread. I liked that they served the local teas and coffees as well as the western options. I wished that the actual buffet layout could have been more spectacular as I have found in other 5 star hotels. Other than that food was good although the fruits on offer were limited given all the different varieties Singapore offers. I only ate here once as the breakfast wasn't included in my rate and I found I could eat elsewhere for a lot cheaper
4
I has taken here by a Singapore born and bred colleague who highly recommended a visit if I wanted to sample the widest range of Singapore cuisine all in one go. He was not exaggerating. There were of course all time favorites like laksa, Hainan chicken, charcoal grilled satay, chili crab, in addition to many new and wonderful dishes I had never come across before and to top up a perfect evening, we had a nice bottle of pinot noir to help wash everything down
5
excellent food beautifully presented tothe eye.friendly staff all types of.food in the buffet for all tastes
5
Lovely restaurant. Ate there two nights in a row and we still wanted more! Great authentic Singaporean food, though admittedly more expensive than the regular hawker centers
4
Best breakfast ever. Such a choice and variety of origin at breakfast is pure luxury. Absolutely marvelous
5
I ate here in a large business group (did not pay the bill :)). The food selection was quite impressive. A large choice of dishes including Laksa, Fried Rice, BBQ duck, many curries and more that I did not recognise (but tried and enjoyed until I was full)
5
The Straits Kitchen offers a buffet of Asian foods from many different corners of the the continent . Excellent quality and the staff will help you choose and put together each dish to get the most from it
4
Great spread as usual. Recommended for people hosting overseas visitors who wants a good overview of local food in nice surroundings. Halal too.
4
If you like buffet eating, this is your place.Great flavourful selections and excellent Asian fare...again tough to get a beverage but other than that good
5
A very good variety of Chinese, Indian, Malay and Singaporean food. The live kitchens are a delight which also ensures that whatever your fancy is, is always fresh. The service was excellent despite the restaurant being almost full.
5
My wife and I love visiting this great restaurant, food is halal which makes it easy for our muslim friends and the variety is wonderful... Great Chinese kitchen, which is very authentic, especially the Hainanese Chicken rice, the Indian kitchen provides excellent curry and nan, and the Malay kitchen provides some delicious items that are especially popular with the crowds. Good value for high quality food... Cannot get enough of this south east asian fare...
5
If you prefer Halal, this is your place. The food is really good, and you have many choices from all the open kitchens that are in the restaurant. Its a modern twist on local favorites
4
Best place to bring business associates or visitors who want to sample good quality local hawker food without having to worry about getting seats at crowded food centres, being overcharged or having any miscommunications. Service is good and efficient even at busy lunch hours when diners are usually in a hurry. Opt for the buffet that offers a good selection of authentic signature local dishes
5
Great choice and variety of foods, all cooked with taste and care. A good destination to enjoy with family and/or friend
5
This place is very popular so it is a good idea to reserve a table. The restaurant highlights popular dishes found in Singapore. The food is fantastic and I enjoyed the dessert section. Lots to eat and I think it is a good value for people who loves to eat.Because it is so busy during the time we ate there, the service is a bit slow as they had to cater to everyone there. So you have to be patient
5
I was there during the last weekend for my anniversary celebration and decided to try out the Straits Kitchen based on the reviews. I must say that i am absolutely impressed with the choices that was available. First and foremost, the food was fantastic and worth the price that i paid for. The dishes were presented well and cooked deliciously. I am however a little dissapointed with the desserts though. Nevertheless it is still good! Definitely going to come again for my second visit soon
5
Wow..great variety of food and lovely staff Who cater to ur individual needs! Manager Mr Mike makes sure ur in top form and makes sure u leave the place very satisfied
4
This was one of the few halal restaurants I could think of when deciding on a place for dinner. I was reminded of my reservation the morning of the dinner, a nice touch; but it was probably done to also eliminate no-shows. Stepping into the restaurant, I suddenly realised how immense it was. I was ready for a sumptuous meal ahead. We were shown to a table tucked in a corner, which was fine as we enjoy a little privacy. When time came for the Muslims to break fast, a team member went round the restaurant with a gong, and started banging away on it. How creative! The international spread was divided into different stations, and everything was itemised and organised. I had wanted a sugarcane drink, but as it turned out, it was chargeable, so yes; not everything is inclusive in the price of the buffet. Food-wise, I cannot fault them. However, I felt the chicken at the chicken rice station could have been better. Personally, it tasted a little undercooked. All in, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a value for money establishment.
3
It's a good place to sample local food if you want them to be Halal and eat in a comfortable environment. The buffet spread is quite extensive and is slightly above average quality. However, if you want truly unique Singapore experience, then go to the food courts or hawker centers. But if you have no time and do not want to subject yourself to the heat and not too adventurous to venture out of the comfort of the hotel, this is a good choice.
5
Topnotch Quality food here in Straits Kitchen.Excellent quality food,courteous service and variety of cuisine and ambience was too good
4
Great place if you want a good variety of food to choose from. There are options of Indonesian, Malay, Chinese and Indian food to choose from. Good place to go as a group. Everyone can choose the variety and quantity of food they need.The food preperation is good and fresh.
5
Very good quality food with very helpful staff. Only one bad point no coffee or tea was offered as part of the buffet and the cost of this is so negligible that it spoils the experience of an otherwise enjoyable lunch!! 
2
We tried booking online but their system didn't work. I did an email booking instead, which worked just fine. We arrived at the appropriate time and were shown swiftly to our table. And then we were abandoned. No one offered drinks, not water nor a wine list. No one explained how it all worked ie it's a buffet and there's a juice and hot drink bar. I practically had to dance on the table to attract anyone's attention as staff were scarce. I ordered water from the grumpy server. It was delivered in a grumpy tone. Had to similarly dance on the table for a refill. Busboys clearing the tables of used plates similarly glum. All round the staff seemed miserable. It wasn't particularly busy. Food wise, the selections are broad Asian and Middle Eastern and really quite well done on the most part. Not haute cuisine, but not your average buffet either. The only time we got good service was when we asked to pay. Invoice provided quickly and processed promptly. It was our second visit in two years, and I don't think I would go back.
5
Everything is wow. Almost all the food is available. with halal certification it also caters to the middle east guests. Be it breakfast, lunch, dinner or a la cart. it's the best choic
4
Wide variety and good quality buffet. Good service on a busy day. Reservation recommended, especially during festive period or for a group.
4
An abundance of choice at very reasonable rate. good quality.try not to eat beforehand as there is a lot to choose from!

Buffet is highly priced at S$55 + 17% per person, but the range of foods is impressive and nicely prepared.Drinks are totally overpriced. A small draft beer costs S$14 +17%; a gin and tonic is S$18-23 +17%. Wine is similarly overpriced.Pretty good service
4
If you are not familiar with local cuisine, this is a splendid place to get started. Everything is excellent. We had satay, prawns, Indian dishes, and sweets including fruit and mango ice cream. Everything was freshly cooked and of high quality. Service is great and we would definetly love to eat in there again
5
An excellent array of regional food choices superbly prepared by specialist cooks. I loved being able to taste dishes I wouldn't normally order

We went to StraitsKitchen with friends last week and had a wonderful experience. The food was AMAZING! I have a gluten allergy, and the chefs were very knowledgeable and helpful with the different gluten-free options. I had the thai curry, indian food and a number of the desserts and left feeling absolutely stuffed. The wine was delicious and reasonable. I think this was a best and highest-value meal in Singapore. We went a few different places and generally found meals to be incredibly expensive and not very memorable. StraitsKitchen was the opposite - reasonable priced (for Singapore) and VERY memorable. Highly recommend this place
4
The Straits Kitchen serves a good range of Malay, Chinese and Indian dishes well loved by the locals. This is a open kitchen concept cooking the food on the spot. It's a buffet, all you can eat
5
Visited as part of a large work group...and it did not dissapointA huge range of different types of food...leaves you struggling to fit everything in..Would definitely return for another awesome experienc

After a long and tiring shopping trip along Orchard Road, you may want to stop at this great restaurant at the Grand Hyatt which is at the top end of Orchard Road, and also close to the MRT. We found all the local favourite food all located in one place. Chinese, Malay, Nyonya and more can be found and the buffet style was very suitable for the various level of hunger. I enjoyed the Roti prata, poh piah, Singapore laksa, and lots more that I should not really mention or one will think I have not eaten for a week before getting to this place. The Rojak was a great way to finish off the satay we had consumed and I will most certainly come back again. Maybe I will stay at the Grand Hyatt after all
5
All food are fresh and taste very goodtea and coffee, espresso is very niceall fresh juicesmany variety of food selectionvery good serviceNONE to be dislike
5
We experienced Straits Kitchen for our daily breakfast buffet. We were spoilt for a choice! So many delectable options that we ended up over eating and yet yearning for more!! Superb service and efficiency. Loved the local food options, don't miss it! All in all a great experience
3
Nothing really stood out for me. $45 for breakfast for nothing special. Would move on to the next thing. They had an okay selection but I could have went next store for a tiny fraction of the price.
5
Great selection of food from various countries. Great chicken and rice. Quite pricey but worth the money
5
We ate at this restaurant twice, once for breakfast and the other time for lunch. There were many options from the Chinese, Indian and Malay dishes most of which were flavorful. Our group voted that the Indian section was the best of the lot. The curries, dhal and tandoor chicken were simply awesome. Highly recommend this restaurant for those who want to sample the best of Singapore's hawker fares
5
If you are foodie, and interested in Asian food, including Indian food, then you shouldn't miss this. Thanks to my friend who treated me here. The range is amazing and every section maintains its taste and flavour - Indian, Malaysian, Singapore, etc.. Highlight was the Dessert section - don't forget to try out the Horlicks flavour - if you are from India you would not need any explanation
4
I love Asian breakfasts, and the noodles here are outstanding - a must try. The coffee is good, though the service could be faster. There are offerings of Indian, Japanese, Chinese and western breakfasts as well
5
We booked this late for a Sunday lunch - staff were excellent, very polite and happy to help and answer any questions.Every dish we tried from the well designed buffet stations was very good - well prepared and well cooked.Recommended
2
This place used to have very good service. Not sure if the management changed or something, but the service has gone down significantly. Before, I never had any issues here. This time they cleaned my table before I finished, a few times - after they put me in a table and then when i went to pick up some food the table was cleaned out (as if i was done). Next few times, when I went for the 2nd serviing, they cleaned the table out. The coffee order takes a very long time to get it. It was never the issue before
5
Unlike the usual buffet in a big hotel, this one is broken up into stations and so things are fresh and can be cooked to order ( besides the usual omelet). Great service once you are seated and a lovely room
3
Dined in here last week for dinner. The only section that satisfy us was the malay corner. Especially the tasty otah-otah. Unfortunately the laksa section wasn't so good. It was tasteless. Same goes to the chicken rice. It was pretty disappointing. The indian cuisine was just fine. Expected better quality/taste of food from a 5 star restaurant. They should consider better quality chicken. All the other dishes was expected to be better and tasty. I guess it doesn't change from the last time i was here 2/3 months back. Paid a high price for unsatisfying food. Really. Sigh.
4
Amazing food, must try the mustard fish, went in a group had a great time with friends and good food. Plenty of food choices. Avoid the lemon juice, too sour and bitter. Avoid weekends for better service.
4
No regrets and Thumbs up! Great service by the staff... Good recommendation from the menu... Comfy place and best of all.. Nice food!!
4
Straits Kitchen has an excellent choice of foods and is very good value.From freshly cooked satay to fresh fruits and desserts, the whole range is excellent, particularly the Indian dishe
3
Variety of food was ok, poor that they dont served Sushi, though they served any other unique asian foods.
1
Only thing that was nice about this place was Mr. Karimuddin's nature and openess to help the guests with their request.
Please do ask for him!
5
Everything here I liked. I had breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nothing better in the area than this place. Indian Counter is extensive and so is the Oriental and the Halaal Kitchen. Fruits cuts and juices all were so nice.
4
I entertained 21 business guests here tonight and it was the perfect venue for my dinner. The choices were plentiful and everyone hailed the dinner for it's diversity and ethnicity. I really thought this place would be the perfect choice for my group and it absolutely delivered. This is a ethnically diverse and high class buffet which I highly recommend for a business dinner crowd. The restaurant is not too loud and the service is fantastic. If you want to impress some guests, take them here ! On the personal note, I don't know if I would come here for just myself; this restaurant doesn't suit the sort of food I truly love. And I wasn't too impressed with the dessert station selection choices. Other than that, I am more than satisfied with the results of this meal from the standpoint of my guests and their reaction to this high quality buffet
4
A buffet style restaurant, which is not my preferred, if I were to choose...However this buffet was a great one, given the variety of different foods, and so many counters, welcoming flavours and inviting dishes.I would recommend, if you can though, to ask what each dish contains, as it is difficult to tell, and you may end up with a full plate with things you don't really like, even though it may have looked appetising when you scooped it on your plate...I am told it is a typical Singaporean cuisine, and some variations include Chinese additions, depending on day. Spicy-wise, it is not too hot, and sauces can be really yummy, I had some that I would definitely like to repeat, if I later remember their names...Deserts were not too good in my opinion, as they were too exotics for my taste. If I am to indulge, I like creamy-runny-zabaione-type pudim, and they had sorbets and fruit puree variaties, which again is not my thing...Anyway, the food was good quality, the ambiance was elegant and the service was 10! Politeness to the highest! :-) and I had a great time! Recommend it
5
I had breakfast buffet at this restaurant everyday during the duration of my stay at the Grand Hyatt. There Was an Excellent variety of selection of international food. Loved cafe latte and fresh juices. They serve grilled vegetables, Indian food and other Asian food, Continental breakfast, Chinese Dimsum, congee and noodles.
4
I came for the buffet lunch. Although I do feel the standard has dropped in the last couple of years, it is still great food. This is good Halal food in centre of town. They have open cooking for Malay, chinese, Indian food and a desert area. Wonderful selection with all the good favorites. Some of the stations are live so the Malay food is grilled in front of you and chinese noodles cook fresh. Wonderful place to entertain and no need to eat dinner after this.
4
we liked the buffet variety.. although I felt the quality has dropped slightly from our previous visit
5
For a hotel buffet, this place is excellent. Not comparableto the same food in a hawker environment for price, but for quality and deliciousness, this has it all. So if you dont want to queue and hustle, take a cool quiet long breakfast, lunch or dinner
5
Wonderful international selection of dishes at the buffet. Staff friendly and helpful. Chinese, Indian, American, Malaysian selections.
5
We spent our first morning in Singapore enjoying the breakfast buffet at StratsKitchen. The ambiance is terrific, the service fantastic, and the selection to our liking.Both manager and staff check back frequently to ensure quality and enjoyment. We enjoyed sampling the fare from the 8 well-appointed stations
2
So I've been spending a lot of time in Singapore lately, and when I woke up earlier than usual one morning I decided to explore breakfast at the Grand Hyatt. Now the spread is nice, and food is of OK quality (the chicken at the Halal station has a lot of fat). What disappointed me the most is that they were not proactive is serving water, when the majority of our body consists of just that...When I finally asked for something to drink and was posed with the "still or sparking" question, I was surprised to see that I was charged S$7++ for the small bottle of Perrier upon being presented the bill. It's not about the money. When offering still or sparkling during breakfast (which, in Asia, traditionally includes everything except alcoholic beverages and soft drinks), I would prefer for the cost to be communicated proactively. Just like the water. Oh wait..
4
If you want to try a wide variety of Asian cuisines like Indian , Chinese, Malay - then this is a good place to come to. The set lunch offers you the chance to go to different food 'stalls' and experience a bit of all the cuisines on offer. The restaurant decor and ambiance is also nice.
2
I remembered my last visit here was quite pleasant. Food was not too bad, service was good. Tonight was a total opposite. Quality of food was bad. Crab was bland, prawn and fish were too salty. I had the duck rice, duck was not too bad but the rice tasted like it's not properly cooked. The nyonya kuehs were terrible. Kek lapis was dry and hard, muah chee was hard too. The ang ku kueh was indescribable. My friend spat it out immediately. A staff that served us the herbal seafood was not friendly at all. He merely asked us how many bowls do we want with a straight face! We said thank you and smile and he totally ignored us. No staff refilled our water. We had to keep on asking. When we did, he did not look particularly please. I'm not sure if you are understaff but I can see the manager(I assume) was walking around. Though we did enjoy a couple of items from the buffet like the coconut ice cream, banana fritters and the yam paste. The ambience in the restaurant was ok too. Honestly, I'd rather go to local hawker stalls to get better food and if I get lucky, a smile from the uncle or auntie hawker. I hope you will do something about this. I expect more from a 5-star hotel restaurant.

Went to Straits Kitchen to celebrate my 25th Silver Wedding Anniversary. We were ushered to our seats. The waiter in waiting asked for our drink order just in case we need more than plain water. Very spacious seating capacity for one to walk. Ambience is nice and very decorative with old photos and plates. The restaurant opened at 6.30pm and we were the first few to step in. The chefs has just finished cooking so the food is definitely freshly cooked. We had satay and the meat is juicy and tender. Even the lamb is well stewed. Only the skin of cooked prawn is difficult to detached. Otah is nice and plump. The duck is also delectable. Even the murtabak taste better than outside hawker centre. It goes very well with the curry. The carrot cake is to die for - one of the most savory and delicious menu there. The chilli crab, even though is huge, is difficult to eat even though the hotel provide the pincer, as the meat stick to the skin. The fish dipped in black sauce dripped with sesame seed has fantastic taste. Only the fried rice is a bit bland but we were compensated with other delicious dishes. There's fresh fruit section, dessert section and many more. Love the muah chee as it is very soft and the peanut is well blended with sugar but the taste is not too sweet either. The kuih2 on the other side is a bit too sweet. The waiter and waitresses there are very attentive. Usually, in a hotel, we use the same fork and spoon, but here, they change for us a few times. The only downside is the pricey amount that we have to pay for food which can be found in the streets/hawker centres
5
It's a little pricey, since it is a restaurant in a hotel, but the food is great. If you can, go on the "Locals Night" menu

Anyway, the exterior was glossy and modernistic as expected, exuding class and style. The inner elegance of the dimly-lit restaurant with its comfortable seats were plain raw beautiful. I was escorted to my seat while waiting for my esteemed dining companion to arrive. Interestingly, in such a setting, they were playing Chinese songs literally.Lunch started, and we began browsing the variety of local / Chinese cuisine on display, in this posh marketplace setting. There was quite a huge spread of food - starting from the Nasi Lemak stall with tantalizing ingredients.We had some Popiah (Chinese spring rolls with turnips, chopped peanuts etc within) - large rolls of ingredients filled spring rolls. The taste was pretty all right - not too salty, a little on the bland side.I took a little of Char Kuey Teow and Fried Carrot Cake alongside with some vegetables. The fried pasta both tasted rather good too, and were not oily.The Satay (meat on sticks) was pretty all right - chargrilled meat that was rather tender, though lacking in the smokey fragrance of traditional satay - and they were careful not to burn the sides (usually I prefer to have a little burned edges).Next, the Prawn Noodles that was light in flavor and flaccid in texture. There were rather big shrimps at the bottom of the soup though, and that (when shelled) enhanced the overall flavor dramaticallyFor full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/lunch-at-straits-kitchen-grand-hyatt.htm

Signature restaurant at Hyatt with a massive variety of Halal buffet food. Attentive service and great interior design by Super Potato. Better reserve on weekends
4
Wide selection of food at breakfast buffet. Dim sum was really tasty. Food and drinks on the whole were good, but not great.
5
My husband and I decided to eat dinner on our second night in Singapore. We are big foodies and this is a must visit, highly recommended. For $55 pp there is a wide range of food on offer, all very fresh and good quality! Thai, Chinese, Japanese and Indian, and great dessert choices. We would definitely go back!
4
Straits Kitchen is a great place to get an introduction to the variety of cuisine Singapore has to offer. The dinner buffet includes Malay, Indian and Chinese options, with the several of the dishes prepared to order at the friendly food stations.The Indian station provides several vegetarian options; and meat lovers are well catered for in all the cuisines.The selection of desserts is also impressive, and the ice creams and sorbets were delicious; but do try cendol or ice kacang to get a taste of the local flavours too.Be sure to arrive hungry!Booking in advance is recommended
5
We had brekkie one morning at Straights Kitchen while staying at the Grand Hyatt. If you're going to do it, make sure you come hungry and pace yourself - there are so many options you have to try a little bit of everything. Aside from the typical offerings of any brunch, there are Japanese selections, local dishes, fresh juice (including veggie- carrot, etc.) Tons of bread options, omelette station, fruit, salad, oh my! It's a good start to any day and will fill you up until dinner :)Singapore doesn't mess around when it comes to food, and this restaurant holds true to the local standard
5
An entire hawka centre in one place, in my last review i believe i said i couldn't find a phrase to describe its greatness which is of epic proportions. This is truly the number 1 thing you should experiene in Singapore if you like food. It is all the best of Singaporean cuisine in one place. I would highly reccomend a hawka centre trail too but if you dont have time, take a shortcut- and just do this.
4
This is my first visit to this buffet restaurant located at the ground floor of Grand Hyatt Hotel.The restaurant offers a wide variety of local food and I wished I has the chance to try all the stations. Next time, I must ration the serving of food on my plate, so that I can try all their food options. I liked their wide variety of food offerings. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Double Boiled Soup: Today's special was Lotus Root Soup. The soup was double boiled and the chef heaped the ingredients in my bowl. Chockful of lean pork (that was flavourful and not dry when you eat it) and lotus root. Yummy!- Chicken, Mutton and Beef Satay: You can see the chef at this station grilling the satay. I tried the chicken and mutton satay and they were nicely marinated and grilled. The peanut sauce was also nice. - Chinese Popiah: Freshly made to order, you can customise the ingredients for this dish. It was filling. - Hand Shaved noodles in spicy braised beef broth(Left) and Sichuan Dan Dan Noodles (Soup): This is only for a limited period. I liked the hand shaved noodles with the beef. The chef will shave the noodles off a block of flour into the boiling water. When the noodles are cooked, it will be placed in a bowl and the braised beef with spicy gravy into your bowl. Caution: Its Hot! I started to perspire in my second mouthful into this dish.- Hainanese Chicken Rice: The chicken was well done. You can also order Roast Duck at this station. Help yourself to the chicken rice and condiments (Chilli sauce, grated ginger, cucumber and tomato).- Tandoori Chicken and Prawns, Palak Paneer and Dum chicken Briyani: The Tandoori chicken was very good. It was my favorite dish for lunch. The Dum chicken briyani was flavourful and chicken cooked in it was tender.- Fresh Juices and Local Drinks: There are fresh juices and local drinks (Sour Plum Drink, Bandung, Chinese Cooling Drink) available. Good choice of drinks to quench your thirst during the meal.- Pulut Hitam: Black Glutinous Rice with Coconut cream. I have been craving this for some time and this was opportune to satisfy my craving. It was good. - Coconut & Horlicks Ice cream: The Horlicks ice cream was good! Try it!- Ginko Nuts, Barley and Bean Curd Dessert: Nice 'cooling' dessert that I enjoyed!There are other delights (Muah chee, Min Chang Kueh, Ang Ku Kueh, Nonya Dessert, Green Bean Soup, malay Rice Cake) available too.Things I had to forego (due to me being full and out of time) was the noodle section (laksa, prawn noodles). So i will go back again. The last serving of food is at 2.30pm for lunch. So go early, so you sit back, relax and have more time to eat
5
Since I have been travelling to Singapore, I have been to this restaurant 3 or 4 times. I will consider it is my favourite restaurant. It is located on the ground floor of Grand Hyatt hotel.It serves variety of great tasting local dishes (when I say local, they are Singaporean and Malaysian foods). By the way, the restaurant is certified Halal, so Muslims, need not to worry.It has Malay, Chinese, Indian and Peranakan kitchens. Whenever I am there, I will surely not going to miss Popiah (Spring rolls), Muah Chee, Kebabs (Lamb, Chicken), Satay, Rojak, etc.All in all, it meets my expectation, I hardly able to find any bad in this restaurant. Do try it out yourselves
4
This was not our first visit and will not be the last. We love the atmosphere, decoration. Food selection was good with all local favourites are offered. Taste was delicious and tasty. Service could have been better and more attentive. They only focused on clearing and not helping guests. It took a long time to be able to order beverage and need to talk to 3 staff to get drinks to our table. Finally, we found a nice service staff who helped us to have a better experience. All in all, it could be better if service is improved
4
This restaurant got a very awesome customer service, their food is great and the location is a winner. Of course I will comeback and promise to bring more friends
5
Came here on business and stayed in the Grand Hyatt. The buffet breakfast at the Straits offers a wide selection of food which tastes good. It can get quite busy in the morning and sometimes they appear short of staff and you have to wait a bit before you were shown to your table.The wide selection of food gets a bit repetitve day by day and given I stayed there for a few consecutive days, it started to get a bit boring towards the last few days. Would be good if the wide selection of food can rotate more
4
Great food, good location and service was fantastic. My daughter really shock when all the staff gathered and sing happy birthday song together with a small cake..thank you to all the staff for giving her a surprise
5
This is one buffet that has all the flavors of Singapore under one roof. I started with the fresh sugar cane juice and moved on to the satay and popiah. This was followed by main courses that included a little from Malay, Chinese, and Indian sections. The dessert choices are also plenty. Of course, my favorite was the chendol but you have a good collection of various pastries. The service is great, the atmosphere is pleasant. You really get a taste of the local flavors Singapore has to offer. It's pricey but well worth it. It's nice to go with a group of people so everyone's tastes can be met
4
Been here many times now , mostly with overseas guests. I usually go for my favorites - laksa, popiah and chicken rice. I'm not good with buffets and just eat 3 out of 50 items that they have. But what I just noticed is how friendly the chefs are, they are smiley and that's always a good thing. I suspect it's just good hiring and training, which is not all that common in the hospitality industry these day
5
We are a cosmopolitan family and needed a restaurant to suit both Eastern & Western taste buds for my brother's 60th birthday. We made a fabulous decision. This place has great ambience, the food is Straits (Malacca Straits) style so no steaks. I ate foods & fruits that I have "forgotten" about. The service was top notch. When I told one of the waiters it was my brother's birthday, he gathered a few of his waiters' friends and sang my brother the Happy Birthday song. It was so touching. I would highly recommend this place to anyone, anyday. Oh, did I mention that it was also great value for money
4
It was a crazy adventure in the Lion City for 60 days - with endless food trips and shopping here and there. Hawker centers top our list of go-to places for good and affordable treats but as a foodie, my tastebuds search for more foodventures. My team has decided to dine at Straitskitchen right beside our serviced apartment. It was a toss between this awesome buffet restaurant and the buffet place across - but we went for the all Asian Halal certified feast. It was a very sumptuous experience -- a celebration of Asian flavors plus their open kitchen in action. Personal favorite was the Indian section but all the food I've tried were definitely one of the best. They don't settle for tasteless buffet food. It's a must-try, worth every cent.
5
This is my favourite place for lunches with friends , family and business. They serve all different kinds of dishes and delicacies that you will not find in restaurants under their buffet menu.The ambience is cozy and people are friendly. The buffet spread includes Indonesian , Chinese , Indian and a huge variety of snacks and deserts. Yummy 
5
If you stay at the Hyatt this is the closest place for a very good breakfast. Very varied selection of choices for around the world, all of which were excellent. Staff are very friendly. The place is a bit labyrinthine so if you are meeting people you may have to wander around this place for a few minutes to find them
4
The buffet breakfast is extensive and tasty, with such a selection everyone should come away satisfied. It is quite expensive, but if you have time to linger over an extended breakfast, then treat yourself 
3
Very hungry for a late breakfast, and ordered a nasi goreng. Tasty but couldn't finish it, and fairly quickly after had an unsettled stomach. Unfortunate, and would probably give it another try. Lost one point because of the aftermath
4
Ate here for breakfast with my family. It was awesome. Lots of choices and they are delicious. I think the place is perfect for foreigner
5
Choice of food is always a magnet. Traditional food plus old time favorite desserts a Comfort for the Foodies!
5
Embarrassed to admit that we liked just about everything this kitchen has to offer, esp. the delectable popiah, laksa, hay mee, char kway tioh, rojak, the crunchy ikan bilis, spicey crabs, otak, turnip cake & other Asian desserts, all authentic & out of this world.
4
Service staff were pleasant and there was too much food to choose from! But please note that it was really ALL local dishes only!
3
We did not really like the buffet. The choices we had were just not what we expected! The room is too dark as well
4
Nice ambience, we did not reserve but managed to get a table. The restaurant is a big hit for corporate meals so it was quite busy. The buffet included Chinese, Malay and Indian style foods which is what we wanted. The dessert was a disappointment as they only had asian style desserts so the kids didn't take anything. Overall, a nice experience and convenient for us as we were staying at the hotel
5
Ate for the first time at Straits on our last visit. Was very pleasantly surprised. The diversity of different ethnic foods was awesome! Heard this was a gentrified hawker center restaurant. Was way more than that
4
This is a must for me almost every trip to Singapore. It is highly recommended that you make a reservation on Fri/Sat or Sun as it is generally booked up. The variety available is just great and caters for all
4
They've got variety of food. Good quality ingredients.International and Asian food including Indian, Chinese, Singaporean
4
StraitsKitchen. Offers a wide variety of items for buffet lunch and dinner, all from hahal-certified open kitchens. Menu highlights include Chinese, Indian and Malay specialties such as Laksa, Butter chicken, beef Rendang, Carrot cake, Hainanese Chicken Rice, and steamed Popiah.Excellent quality and diversity (see photos)
5
If you want a true taste of Singapore food I suggest you head here. Curries, satays, barbeques, soups, noodles and rice varieties, desserts - the spread is fantastic. We went during lunch and later realised we should have not eaten anything in the past 48 hours to do justice to the varieties of food on offer! It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Singapore
3
This used to be a regular go to for my family and my business visitors to Singapore,a crash course in local cuisine/street food but sad to say it has gone off the boil quite badly now. Most recently we visited for dinner and were slotted into a time slot at 7.30pm to suit the restaurant rather than ourselves. Our initial table was at the back next to the piled trays of used plates and trays and after much protest we were finally moved to a table with mismatched chairs next to a counter but hey ho,at least it was better.The food was as always the 'classics' and we have learnt by now to pace ourselves and to be highly selective but I have to say you can get much better versions of these staples outside Straits Kitchen eg laksa,satay,chicken rice,rojak etc etc. In addition when you are paying $55++ a head,having to pay extra for juices,teas and coffee is a bit steep.Service was haphazard requiring constant calls to get plates cleared and the bill took forever to come by which time the restaurant was down to about 30% occupancy. All up $330 for 5 pax for an Asian buffet of very variable quality. WilI I go again unlikely, which is hard because as a Hyatt Diamond passport member this limits my options considerably here. On the plus side the decor is inventive and industrial chic so pleasant. Hyatt,time for a bit of QC I think and soon please
5
If you've ever walked through Singapore's numerous wet markets and thought 'wouldn't it be great if all the best food was in one place' as I did. Well, good news that place exists and it just so happens to be that this place is in the luxurious, air conditioned comfort of the Grand Hyatt on Scotts Road. Chinese, Malay, Indian it's all there. BBQ, curries, noodles, sweets, drinks you will not need to eat for a month afterwards, in preparation you may not wish to eat for a month prior also. It's an amazing experience and well worth blocking out the whole lunch time period to properly enjoy. It's a must do for foodies!
3
I did explain in my general comments about the resaturant in my review for Grand Hyatt Singapore. I guess the music selections maybe need to be more selective based on the mood and time of the day. It does not really matter if it is Indonesian or a US chart but be more sensitive to people who is dining at the restaurant
3
Good commercial idea: First, main Singapore hawker dishes served in air-con environment (prawn mee, laksa, chili crab, satay, biryani, popiah, Hainanese chicken rice, roast duck, durian ice cream, etc). Secondly, it's all halal. So they capture two target client groups (a) out-of-town guests who want a quick overview of Singapore street food, and (b) lots of Muslim Singaporeans going to a place they can trust. Although you can have the same dishes better cooked and at lower prices elsewhere, overall it's still pretty good here. (By comparison, a new, beautiful restaurant in the CBD also offers glorified hawker dishes, but really badly cooked!) I would have rated it one star higher, but for the high price and the mainly-absent wait staff
5
Had breakfast everyday here, the buffet consisted of Western (bread, smoked salmon, chicken, salad, sausages etc.), Chinese (dim sum, noodles, congee), Indian (dosai, roti, vadai) and the necessary fruit juices, coffee and tea.They provide new papers to read (even some international papers like the International Herald Tribune) so it was always a great breakfast for me
4
Straits Kitchen has the best Asian buffet spread in Singapore. From the rojak station to the Malay station, the Chinese and the Indian station. All the food are cooked right before you and you can't get anything more fresh than that.My wife and enjoyed the butter curry chicken from the Indian station. It was absolutely divine! Maybe because they cooked their curries using yoghurt instead of coconut milk that made it taste extra yummy.The chicken rice and noodles from the Chinese station was also very good. Unfortunately I found the satay at the Malay station a little on the dry and hard side.Overall Straits Kitchen buffet is a must try, if nothing else for the butter curry chicken. Service was only average though. Two thumbs
1
You expect the buffet at a 5 star hotel to be 5 star right ?This place is more 1 star, even though breakfast for two cost me $82.00My cafe late when it eventually came was made by an automatic machine. The sausages were inedible rubbish. The cheese selection was lousy. The poached eggs were inedible because of the vinegar over dose.I feel ripped off for having had an $82.00 breakfast that was a ripoff when I could have gone around the corner and got one for a quarter of that price with a real coffee and edible food
5
Due to to my very limited time during an overnight stopover trip in Singapore I decided to try out the StraitsKitchen for dinner. This buffet restaurant specialises in local Singaporean 'hawker' type dishes and I could therefore sample a whole range of dishes in a single sitting (greedy, greedy me!) I thoroughly enjoyed the experience here. There was an amazing variety of dishes from the the 4 main food stations (Malay, Peranakan, Chinese and Indian) and the food was generally authentic and of high quality (and frequently replenished). The service was a bit hit and miss, they were very quick with my first wine order & water as well as with clearing used plates after each course and providing finger bowl, etc. for the crab, but I found it difficult to get my water refilled and to get the bill at the end. Still, overall I would highly recommend this restaurant especially for overseas visitors wishing to sample a lot of local specialties in one go. Of-course you can find cheaper, better versions of all the dishes offered elsewhere in Singapore, but the convenience, nicely decorated (and air-conditioned) environment and sheer variety of dishes make it very worthwhile if your time in Singapore is limited or your unsure about where to go on the local food scene

This was my 1st time here & i was looking forward to the food that people was so talking about. But it fail to impress me. Service Staff and food was ok, nothing to shout ''Wow'' that impressed me. Staff took at least 10 mins or rather I had to call them for water even being seated for more than 10mins at table. Staff was ok in service but felt they were just getting the job done rather than having customer service.Food was less than impressive for this hotel. To be fair, they had 3 main counters for Chinese, Indonesian & Indian food but, no Jap nor seafood counter for a 5 star hotel buffet is not good, esp for the price that we are paying at S$60plus per pax on a weekday.I felt the price I was paying for is like eating ''High Class'' Hawker food which was disappointing.Only food that made me felt good was the Roast meat section, the roast duck was very good.And come on, Helper or Chefs behind the counters, we know you are busy but if you are in charge to serve customers, at least ''Smile'' and ask what would you like, instead of customer asking can I have that. Even Mcdonalds staff can do better here

It's one of the best buffet spreads in the city with lots of western and Asian options. I especially love the fresh fruit smoothies and juices available.

I have visited Singapore three times within 6 months. Last time I came to Singapore for Professional Examination and I had celebration dinner with friends at StraitsKitchen. I always choose to stay at Grand Hyatt because of its excellent location and service. And everytime I visit Singapore, the first dinner will be dined at the StraitsKitchen.Very nice environmentVery friendly staffsVery tasty foods, in particular the Satay, Crab, Laksa, Tonic soup and the Singaporean desserts.One can taste all popular Singapore food in one goalValue for money and time.Will come back for sur

Pros:- Wide selection of Asian cuisine- Good quality of food- Attentive staff- Wonderful atmosphereCons:-Price tag doesn't come with drinks.. C'mon... pls don't make me choke. - Slow replenishment of food.- Chefs looked miserable. I say give them a raise, maybe? Hehe
3
Francophone or not, you will fall in love with this place.By virtue of the meals served in its cafe/restaurant, or its beautiful gourmet products on display. This place is unpretentious yet chic enough for both business folk and ladies-lunchin' to have an intimate and enjoyable experience.I can see why this is a destination on its own - true to its roots, yet simple in its application
4
This buffet restaurant offers a good quality varity of western and asian cuisines.For me it differs from other buffer resto because of they offer most malaysian delicacies and sweets. Seafood selections are only few.
4
A wide range of Asian cuisine was offered for the buffet. Different live stations offering Indian, Malaysian, Singaporean etc fare. Great place for a heart meal and the best part is it was HALAL.So we could eat everything that was offered. And there was plenty of it
4
I went with two childhood friends to Straits Kitchen and it set us back to when we were younger. The food was superb and the service was excellent. The price was so reasonable. I loved the satays, the chicken rice and the chili crab! We ate a lot and had a wonderful time
5
The buffet was lovely! Thoroughly enjoyed myself! Highly recommend you to go! Totally worth it, every single cent. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful
4
If you wish to explore a variety of cuisines I think you are at the right restaurant. It serves you with almost all varieties of food but make sure to make a prior reservation
5
Good spread of variety. I would definitely highly recommend trying "Buddha jump over the wall" if chinese soups are your thing
3
I've eaten at the Hyatt's other restaurant (Mezza9) before and the food was good so I thought I'd take my family to StraitsKitchen in the same hotel. This is more like a traditional Singapore hawker centre in setup so there was lots of choice which is great when you have teenaged sons who like different foods. The restaurant has nice decor & was buzzy but I don't think staff were sufficiently attentive both in terms of serving drinks (everything else is buffet) or clearing away, so it didn't feel quite as plush as it should have given the hotel's rating. The food was good and of course you can eat as much as you like, so indulge
4
Came across this restaurant when was serching for the Halal certified buffet in Singapore and found this reasonable priced buffet. We had a lunch (Sunday) here and we arrived 15 mins before 12pm(the start timeof buffet) and we walked around the Hotel after we came back 15 minutes later we were in the queue of at least 30 meters long! This show that this restaurant is very popular among Singaporeans and foreigners. This buffet have a wide spread of Indian cuisine and chinese. We tried the roasted duck it was OK. We prefer the Indian cuisines more. The Deserts were so so. My personal preference is the durian ice cream with banana spretter. The taste of the foods is nice and huge variety but what i can say that only few of Indian cuisines stand out and the rest are not fastastically good
4
I think this restaurant has two real strengths. One, because it is a buffet it offers a wide array of Singaporean food that diners can sample before they head out in search go a more 'authentic' hawker experience. Not sure if carrot cake is your thing? Try it here before discovering that it is not actually a baked treat with cream cheese icing in Singapore. Secondly, you get to dine in air-conditioned comfort and that is not to be under-estimated. You will pay for the privilege, about $55 a head plus drinks, but for those travelling with grumpy small children it is worth it!On to the food, I am sure that there are spicier, cheaper, more dynamic versions of all the dishes in food halls across the city. But for those not in the know, this place gathers all those dishes under one roof allowing you to eat as much or as little as you like. For me the standouts, were the pippies in xo sauce - spicy and fresh. The laksa was also good but a bit more heat would have made it great. The curries at the Indian stand were insanely good, especially the aloo gobi and the smokey tandoori chicken. My husband fell in live with the smoked duck breast on offer while our son happily pigged his way through Hainanese chicken and fried rice. The only thing that I was hoping to sample but couldn't find was spicy fried chicken
4
Had good Indian Veg Food for breakfast and lunch buffet. It would help to have clear labelling of food ie whether it is Veg or Non-ve
2
Really disappointed with both the quality and the temperature of food here. Don't recommend at all. The only food that was just ok was the Indian service the rest v average. Can eat much better at a hawker stall.
4
Always the lunch place of choice whenever I'm in Singapore. Its always buzzing during lunch hours but calm enough to hold a discussion. Smoke breaks unfortunately will be outside under the Singapore blazing sun or rain
5
There are plenty of choices. Though i have been here 5 consecutive mornings and it did get a little bored towards the end
3
It's ok, but just wished there was more variety. Although they did cook eggs upon order unlike some hotel buffets where I suspect the scrambled eggs came from a mix
3
Staff and service were awersome, but food is just so-so. It's like hawker food from different stalls / centres all lumped into one restaurant. I'll say the indian food corner is the best, their naans were yummy
4
The place was pumping on the Saturday night we visited. Vibrant atmosphere and more food than you can imagine. Everything we sampled was great!
2
Raw tandoori chicken was served at the StraitsKitchen buffet. Manager Mike SR was slow to react. The laksa has true local flavor
5
do you desire quail eggs for breakfast, great coffee, a smorgesboard of dishes, then this is the one to choose. And you will also be treated so well by the staff!!
5
My friends took me and my wife here for a dinner. Very good and authentic South East Asian food served for the buffet. You can have a taste of all of them in just one dinner. Very good indeed. The price is also reasonable. This is Grad Hyatt Hotel. Location is also very good. In city centre and close to the underground station. Service very good.Was told that it is better to make your booking at least one week in advance
5
Fresh juices, halal dimsums, cozy ambience. Hope they'll include some japanese highlights though! Try coming in earlier especially at weekends and holidays as the queue could be frustrting
5
Huge variety of freshly cooked food, which is topped up regularly. Highlights for me are always the satay and Indian cuisines. Take your time here and set aside a few hours for the evening, so it's not rushed.
4
I was staying at the Grand Hyatt and popped down for a quick meal. The place was packed and I had to wait a bit for a table. The buffet range was tremendous - Singaporean, Malaysian and Indian cuisines all represented and great flavors. Would I go again? Well I definitely would if I am staying at the Hyatt but not sure if I was staying somewhere else as Singapore has so many great restaurants to choose from.
4
The staff were helpful and friendly. As for the food, there was a good range and generally the quality was good. The stations whereby we could interact with the service staff were fun and interesting.
4
Good atmosphere you will realized the moment you step in. They play asian song, and surprisingly Sheila On7 one of it. Feel like at home town. Sheila, Amelia, And Susan has done a good job. The moment I placed a bowl of chili crab on the table, a crab tong and a bowl of warm water with lemon slice were besides me. Will coming back again for sure.
2
When I called to ask about a birthday celebration, staff suggested that I buy a cake from Carousel as their buffet only has pandan kaya cake.Limited choice of asian food, with an even more limited dessert range. The kuehs were subpar (definitely not Bengawan Solo standard)Not worth the $45 per pax definitely.Staff was also very rude and kept hurrying us when we were trying to pay our bill.I didn't like that they don't provide table mats, such that the utensils are in contact with the bare table. Not sure how clean the table will be
5
On 8th Dec 13, my mum and myself went to Straits Kitchen at Grand Hyatt for lunch buffet.The was a large spread of Asian dishes. I tried almost all of the dishes and it was delicious.We want to make a special mention of the staff who served us, they were very professional and very friendly. We would like to thank, Straits Kitchen for providing us a wonderful lunch experience.We will be back again and would strongly recommend to our families and friends.Thank you.Rgds,Stephe
5
This is an excellent place to go to if you want to sample different Asian flavours, Fortunately, during our short break in Singapore, me and my family were able to secure a reservation. We were very pleased with our experience at StraitsKitchen. What made our experience even better was that the food is Halal and our choices were therefore unrestricted. I was able to try Asian dishes that I had not tried before, which was the highlight for me. The only unfortunate aspect of my experience was that I could not try all the dishes! As the food was of such a high quality, I feel the price was worth it. I definitely plan on returning to StraitsKitchen in the future
4
Dined there with friends. I'm so pleased with the ambiance, professional service. Also, I tried various dishes in the buffet especially Indian and Chinese food. There is plenty of seafood. The dessert is also delicious. The price is worth for 5 star dinner.High recommended for those who can enjoy local food
5
At $55 usd per person, this restaurant located in the Grand Hyatt consistently serves some of the best asian food varieties.If your visit is short in Singapore and you like to try some of best varieties of Asian flavors for the region, I highly recommend this restaurant
5
Great selection of food, from eastern to asian. The great staff with sweet smile and service. Many of hot food and fresh fruit juice.
4
Dined here on a stop over to Europe and the buffet is an easy introduction to some of the foods available in Singapore. Hotel environment helps when you have just flown in and the Kitchen provides a relaxing dining experience. The food was of good quality although the trick is to take small portions of the variety available. Was pretty good value but for some the real hawker market may be a better experience if you have time to get to them
3
We went there on a sunday night. It was busy but the service was quite good. The staff were attentive and the place is clean. Foodwise, there was not a single outstanding dish compared to hawker style food centers. Chilli crab is not what you would expect in Singapore. It doesn't have gravy. Coconut ice cream was one of the better dish out of the whole buffet.If you are looking for authentic singapore local food, go to a hawker centre
3
We have been bringing our foreign visitors to this place for years to enjoy air-condition comfort of local food, which is Halah while beer is available. The location at the lobby of Grand Hyatt also adds prestige to the ambience. However, it seems less exciting over the years, as more and more local air-conditioned food courts are offering interesting menu and fun way of casual dining. Their buffet price of $53 per head (with service and GST) is reasonable, however, beware that beverage such as fresh juice/coffee/tea on the buffet spread are not included in the price. Four of us spent S$62 on beverage. It would be ideal if the package could reflect the true cost. Also it might be time to improve the food quality and bring back the excitement
4
To get a mouth watering impression about the South East Asian food selection, the StraitsKitchen offers an excellent lunch and dinner buffet. A must for lovers of Nonja food and other local makang
5
The Good =)~Though pricey, this is the only buffet which cooks up a storm with its many choice of local food.~Attentive staff.The Bad =(~During peak times, too crowded.~Based on Buffet-standards, one of the more pricier ones.My Tip for future visits:~Don't get a table far from from the buffet table!You'll regret it when you have to carry 2 plates & walk a distance back to your table
1
I just came back from a birthday celebration with my family. It was horrible. The food wasn't fresh & quality was substandard. It seemed like only the Herbal Soup was good. Everything else was either too starchy, too bland, too spicy, or too sweet (desserts).We decided to visit Straits Kitchen instead of Asian Kitchen due to recommendations from our friends. However, we were utterly disappointed. Their Satay was made of large chunks of fat which we had a hard time chewing, Char Kway Teow was so very starchy & bland, & the Chili Crab was the worst I've ever eaten in my life- the shell was too hard to break even with nutcrackers, it wasn't fresh & the crab contained more air than meat.The only redeeming factor was the service- all the staff wore smiles on their faces & they did a good, fast job of clearing our dirty dishes.I'm sorry I had to post such a bad review & my family & I really don't understand why our experience paled so much in comparison to the other diners. Perhaps we got there at a bad day? Nevertheless, we won't be going back again
5
I had a high regard of Grand Hyatt reptutation so when I was in Singapore, I could not miss a chance to have dinner at such a wonderful place.Perfect buffet with variety range of local foods.The staff always smiled from the entrance to the table. The atmosphere was great, very gorgeous and fabulous. I really loved the dessert here with cute small cakes and fresh fruit juice. The price was totally ok compared with high quality of service.I chose this one for a great night out
5
The food is great & the choices are plenty. The atmosphere also was nice. I enjoy the food here very muc
5
very good variety, good vegetarian choice in breakfast and Indian section for breakfast & buffet dinner, nice ambienc
5
8 different cooking style of regional food:Thai, Malay, Indian, Southern Chinese styles. Lots of seafood, excellent desserts.
5
We had a perfect lunch in this beautiful restaurant. Really cool furnished, very careful staff, excellent food. And the bill was even better! Perfect.
5
One of our friends staying in Singapore took us for lunch here at Grand Hyatt Singapore on 10 Scott's Road,StraitsKitchen is a restaurant located on the ground floor at the rear of the hotels foyer.The restaurant offers a wide selection of Singapores many cultural foods which are famous and are often sort after from visiting foreigners and the locals at hand.The Kitchen serves a array of dishes cooked fresh and served in traditional decorative serving arrangements.From Indian,Thai,Malay,to fushion Singaporean authenticity cooked and presented so you self serve as much as you can eat.The staff were just great especially with the kids and took care when you approached the service stations to tell you what was on hand to try.I personally could not try every single dish on offer but I sure did give it a go,I especially took a fancy to the local food the Indian/Malay curries and the Chinese food was to die for.So tasty and so well presented it was simply a party in my mouth."I was in culinary heaven".For $35 dollar per head all you can eat it was far more than just a common buffet restaurant as many would think,Food cooked to perfection and turned over once a quarter of the serving dishes were empty sure makes you know the food is never dry or unappetizing in taste or presentation,after all one eats with their eyes before you taste.They also had a great desert bar that served local favourites and a juice bar that also served a array of hot and cold beverages famously found any where in Singapore and enjoyed by the locals and foreigners when dinning out.Grand Hyatt Singapore sure knows how to show what Singapore has to offer in this creatively curated Dinning spot,it's a gem for the staying guests at the hotel that want to taste Singapore with out going out of the hotel in the mid day heat.Well thought over I must say.I will go back with no hesitation and recommend this great restaurant to any one that wants to explore Singapores favorite and well known dishes all which are found in one place,What more can you ask for.I give it 5/5 for food,service and most of all price
5
we had booked the buffet for Sunday lunch. making reservation was very easy, though i had to consistently try for a few times before actually i got the booking. so if you have special occasion, make sure you book in advance since this place gets full fast even though the place i quite large.the spread of the buffet was good authentic local and deliciousssssssssssssss.i could not stop eating. right from the soups, salads till the desert. you just don't want to skip any part of eat.a bit noisy but who cares when you are eating your favorites!!!
5
Their breakfast variety and the varieties of coffee/tea was amazing.This was one of the hotels where I can find my favourite idlis, dosas, pooris etc. One suggestion is to include a fruit bread.
4
Went with a group of my colleagues for a random dinner get-together session. As it is a buffet style restaurant, we are not arranged to be sitted together, but in groups of 6-7 pax per table. There is a good variety of hawker food, ranging from Indian to Nonya kuehs. The popiah is as good as those you can get from coffeeshops outside and they satay is fantastic! Definitely will visit again
5
Go to the buffet to experience great tastes of Asia. If you are not familiar with local cuisine, this is a splendid place to get started. Everything is excellent. Enjoy
5
We booked this restaurant based on its TripAdvisor rating. It certainly lived up to expectations. The range of food options was massive. We had satay, prawns, Indian dishes (particularly good), and sweets including fruit and mango ice cream. Everything was freshly cooked and of high quality. The restaurant is large, but nicely done with some great interior design details. Table service (ordering/delivering drinks and removing used plates) was very good. The only issue was the price of drinks, which was high. If in Singapore in the future we would definitely eat here again
5
Breakfast here is amazing. Every food you can image to eat in the morning. Service is great and we would defo love to eat in there again
4
Another one of my favorite restaurants and indeed very affordable. We go there when we are really hungry and want a great nosh-up. The setting is like a marketplace set in a buffet style with lots of different stations offering an extensive variety of local and Asian food. I always make a beeline for the Indian station - you must try the chicken Tikka and Nan bread as it is presented piping hot straight out of the clay oven .. The chicken just melts in your mouth. You can also get a variety of local favorites like Chicken Rice and roast duck. There is a variety of deserts and fresh cut fruit. Make sure you have an empty stomach and just indulge yourself. The restaurant is very affordable considering that everything is included including free flow of fresh juices. Lunch about US$30 for adults and half of that for children Diner is US $35. The restaurant is extremely popular and is always busy weekdays and weekend so always phone ahead and book a table
5
A buffet lunch where we were able to sample all the different cuisines that Singapore has to offer! A huge variety of dishes cooked to order, friendly staff, lovely setting and terrific desserts. What more could you ask for?
4
We wanted the hawker experience but not the heat of the outside stalls so this was a good alternative. Many options and we all tried something different. Was easy and delicious.
4
it was a new year eve lunch with my department. I love the food spread and the service staff were all friendly. worth spending your penny..
4
Went to for dinner during Ramadan - it was expensive but they had a huge variety of foods, including a special middle eastern section. The staff at the buffets were helpful and friendly, I enjoyed most of what I tried, but wouldn't call it gourmet fare (which for the price, it should have been) and found some of the food (as is typical at a buffet) was a bit over-cooked and dry. Would go back for lunch when the price might be more reasonable
4
We were invited to a dinner at StraitsKitchen but did not know what to expect. We are not crazy about buffets but this one was really good. There were various types of Asian food to choose from. I ate mostly Indian as that is my favorite but tried the chili crab and chicken rice. If you are visiting Singapore, this would be a great place to go and try a little bit of everything to get a taste of various Asian cuisines. Most of the other buffets we have visited in Singapore are all single cuisine so we prefer the variety of StraitsKitchen
3
Most hawkers do the food way better than the spread here. The only offering that Straits Kitchen has is its halal certificate. There are not many places in Singapore having this cert and serving passable buffet spread. If you are hosting some foreign guests with dietary concerns, this could be the place. However, I will definitely avoid this place on any other occasion. I would rather spend the money for a feast at a hawker as this place is way overpriced for the quality of food.The location is good, right smack in the middle of Orchard Road
3
Over the years we have dined at the Straits Kitchen numerous times. Always enjoy the chance to try so many different styles & dishes. It is higher priced than going to the Hawker stalls, but a nice way to experience if you are not up for that. Recommended for those visiting Singapore for the first time, as it is easy way to be introduced to wide range of cusines found in Singapore
3
The quality of the food is quite good, and the variety is enough to say tht one has tasted most local fare in one sitting, However, pls, if you can, aim to eat famous hawker centre food. Much cheaper prices at better taste (and maybe more calories ;) 
5
When in Singapore, we all want to try the local cuisine... such as Chili Crabs, Chicken Rice, Indian Cuisine... and we all wonder around to many places and often we can disappointed. The Straits Kitchen is the perfect option, the best local cuisine with the best of the best service standard. I have tried many times since the opening of the restaurant, and not even once, I have had anything less than Perfect experience! The exceptional Mike Sr the manager in Charge will make sure the flow of services are above the perfect Standard, Yen Ping, Charlie, Osman who will assist Mike to make sure the perfect services straits through the day, month, year and always.. breakfast lunch and dinner.. ! Impeccable... Great Staffs including remarkable Foo Kok Seng.. the restaurant is only your option if trying out the best local cuisine in Singapore, that is if you can make the reservations!!!! so full and so busy!! Recently, Amazing Audrey from Grand Club join the restaurant as the manager and made the restaurant even more exceptional place to be!I know the names this is how often I visit the restaurant and how good they are! You will never regret but will be like myself, ambassador to the restaurant! Enjoy the Straits Kitchen and do not forget to make the reservations in advance
5
This fantastic buffet lets you taste the best of Singapore street food prepared by the best Singapore chefs. From chili crab to chicken rice, to fabulous fruits and desserts, this is a truly unique-to-Singapore dining experience. Some of the food is very hot and spicy...bring Tums
4
The food is fantastic and authentic Singaporean hawker style food stalls, all in a very stylish cafe style dining rooms in the Hyatt. Edgy interesting decor. Filled with locals as well as tourists which is always encouraging
5
Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh. They practically unload the truck from the market directly to the cooking stations. Everything cooked individually for you catering to your preferences. Largest selection imaginable.
5
The buffet breakfast was excellent, there was a lot of choice of different cuisines. Excellent choice of fruits
4
Great so long as the food quality is maintained. We've visited several times and the food is consistently good. A bit pricey for hawker fare - but is classier than a hawker centre!
4
Varied exotics fresh pan Asian cuisine. Staff were friendly, explaining the different types of cuisines and flavours involved.Location in grand Hyatt was also good, centrally located. The decor in the restaurant was also nice and made for a relaxing evening.The bill wasn't chep, but I guess as one of our more formal dinners out this was a great eatery
5
If you want a good overview of different cuisines of Singapore, then this is the place! It is an open buffet offering a rich and generous selection of Chinese, Malay and Indian food. Obviously a very popular place, reservation is essential. Wide range of wines to choose from. Super service
5
Just like what they say on the website.StraitsKitchen is a Singapore-inspired restaurant presenting the best of local cuisine in a contemporary marketplace setting.The halal-certified theatre kitchens serve a smorgasbord of popular local favorites, such as Satay, Beef Rendang, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Laksa, Tandoori Chicken and Naan. For dessert, indulge in a lovely selection of local favourites such as Almond Jelly, Banana Fritters and home-made Durian ice-cream.Celebrate local food and discover a uniquely Singaporean showcase of tastes, sights and sounds
4
This is the place to go if you want a taste of Singapore's local delicacies. The Straits Kitchen serves a good range of Malay, Chinese and Indian dishes well loved by the locals. This is a open kitchen concept cooking the food on the spot. It's a buffet, all you can eat. Some of the dishes include satays, sambal chicken, otah, chili crab, double boiled herbal soup, nann, indian curries, chicken rice, roast duck, laksa, prawn noodle and dessert like chendol, nonya kuehs, rojak and many more. The Straits Kitchen serves Halah certified food
5
The great open kitchens are a feast to the eyes and your taste buds. You have 3 kitchens one indian (my favorite) one Chinese and one local. so it is a GREAT bufet but all is freshly cooked on the spot - Great place individually as you can taste all your want and perfect with a large group as then every one will find something they like and do not be scare to taste. Breakfast can be a busy place so try to go before 8am. for lunch and dinner if you have a large group BOOK ahead of time
5
The selection is enormous and the quality of food is superb. You won't be disappointed! The only thing lacking a bit is the service; as it is a buffet-style restaurant, you can only expect so much personal attention. Otherwise - this place is tops for all Singaporean-food-loving fans
4
Great for taking anyone who misses local food there. Spread is fantastic and the only complaint is eating too much!
5
We had breakfast here. It was very popular and the food is very like local food hawker style which is great as we then can taste everything local in one restaurant.
4
I have dined in SK a few times and am becoming familiar with the cuisine. The food is always mouthwatering and the choices quite diverse. The restaurant itself is a nice alcove of varnished wooden setting that is cool and calm. The juices are excellent.
5
Very good local and international dishes. Really friendly helpful chefs to explain the dishes etc. Try the crushed iced dessert, much better then the ones you buy at the hawkers.
4
This my girlfriend favorite asian restaurant. Not my favorite because I think they reduced the spices. but not bad also
4
If you approach Straits Kitchen with the view to compare single item with the best street food and the price for them, you will conclude that this place overcharges for the food quality. But I am afraid that's missing the point. This is the place you want your foreign guests to have a guided tasting of local fares in a comfortable setting and be able to try as much or as little without having to rush around to the various hawker centres and hope to catch a singe item that was supposed the best of class. While crowded, the acoustics is good enough to carry on a business conversation as well. We went there with 5 other foreign guests for lunch and had a great time. They were conservative in their selection initially but they were emboldened to try spicier dishes the second round. We thought of Blue Ginger as an alternative for such an occasion but thought that our guests would have little to fall back on if they find it too spicy. Not Straits Kitchen. We will be back again for similar occasions even though it costs $60 SGD per person with drinks
3
I have been to Straits Kitchen three times with different groups of friends. Twice with friends who were in Singapore for the first time and had less than 24 hours, and once with some colleagues. Having lived in Singapore for a good number of years, I can safely say that there are much better options elsewhere.Most of my Singaporean friends think that they have had better at hawker centres.While food here isn't that great, Straits Kitchen does have a wide variety of Singaporean dishes. I am not an expert with Singaporean food, but I think most of the common Singaporean dishes can be found here. It is a great place for travellers who have only a day in Singapore, but wish to sample as many local dishes as possible. Other good things about Straits Kitchen is the ambience is better than what you get at the food centres and that all the dishes are halal. For travellers who have more than a day, I would recommend that you venture out and dine at the Hawker centres. If the humidity and heat is an issue to you, a more comfortable option would be Food Republic (an air-conditioned food court). Order a few dishes from different stalls, and share it amongst a few people
5
When we arrived a short time reservation was arranged by the concierge of the Hyatt hotel immediately, although we were not guests of this hotel. Arriving at the restaurant which is located inside the Hyatt, we were welcomed very friendly and placed to a separate table.The choice of food and drinks is hugue and Ã  discretion, i. e. you can eat as much as you want for 54 SGD per person; drinks have to be paid separately. Our 18-month-child was admitted to eat free of charge.There are several buffets with chinese, malaysian and indian food. The taste and quality are great, although sometimes a bit spicy. You may ask questions to the cooks about the food and you'll get detailed and friendly information. All the staff are attentive, helpful and fast. The atmosphere is not too formal, comfortable, clean and with attention to many details.Definitely worth a visit when you are in Singapore: you'll get a good Impression about food and local drinks
4
Really enjoyed the wide selection of cuisine from each of the major cultural groups represented in Singapore. It is Prix Fixe except for alcohol, so there are no surprises. What it amounts to is a representative sample of the various Hawker Centres around the city, which provides a means of tasting the variety of the local cuisine for the less adventurous. That is both its strength and its weakness. You can find better representations of each type of cuisine if you know which Centre to visit, and the fixed price represents a pricey up-charge to pay for the central location inside a world-class hotel. However, it does feature one tasty local cuisine to recommend, which you would be hard pressed to find outside of Singapore and its neighbors Indonesia and Malaysia: Chicken with Black Nuts (ayam buah keluak). Only a tiny number of restaurants in town feature this Peranakan specialty, which takes a long time to prepare as you need around three days of soaking to draw out the flavor in the nuts.Despite the $$$ price, this restaurant is highly recommended, particularly if you have only a short stay in Singapore as a means to graze your way around Singapore from a single seat
4
This is probably my 5th time here in the past 10 years and i think my 1st review. Came here for a business lunch and probably easier to get seats. This place is still booked solid for dinner and weekends days in advanceThis being a 5 star hotel restaurant, expect the decent service and ambience. The food is laid out in sections by cuisine - chinese, malay, india etc. so that's helpful for guests. Standouts include the laska noodles, fried carrot cake, fried chinese noodles etc. Sure, you can get better individual dishes elsewhere in singapore but this is a convenient and comfortable place to get everything under 1 roofThere are local drinks, and desserts as well. For foreigners wanting to taste durian without eating the smelly fruit itself there's the durian ice creamTea and coffee is a seperate charge from the buffetOverall a decent place for foreign friends, or a group of local friends who want to eat everything at onc

Always enjoy eating at the Straits Kichen. Nice and quality local foods to sample. Hard to get reservations though as it is very popular.
5
The food was so tasty, I could have eaten there everyday! You must eat there! It's located in the Grand Hyatt.
4
Great place to try a variety of local and asian dishes in 5 star ambience. Almost everything was good, from the gado gado, satays, noodles to the kebabs and desert.
Will be back.....

A massive restaurant covering most of the Mezzanine floor of the Grand Hyatt in Singapore. Superb service and food, covering a wide Asian range. Everything is clearly fresh and the kitchen is very visible and actually part of the restaurant layout. Great wine selections.

After watching Anthony Bourdain layover in Singapore decided to visit the restaurant in Grand Hyatt. Went at 9pm - late (to late) - no chance to get table before. It was crowded so if others like it we will have a nice dinner. No we did not. I expect fresh made asian dishes - but most of them were heated all the time - not crispy - not hot - like cheap buffet. We liked ice crem made of sweet corn. I don't recommed this place - sorry - enjoy any howker center - better food and value for money. We spend 200$ way to much. Singapore is great foodie pleace so look for better spot

I came here for a business dinner with some clients who were Muslims so we had to go to a halal restaurant. The service is excellent with attentive details! And the spread of local hawker style food was most authentic and delicious. My clients enjoyed their dinner so much and kept saying laksa and chili crab was very delicious and kept going back for more. I really like the chicken rice I thought that was my favourite. It is great that grand Hyatt Singapore has an excellent halal restaurant so that we can enjoy good food good service

The restaurant is in the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and it offers a wide range of food -- Chinese, nonya, Indian etc. you have to pay extra for drinks ( except plain water). The satay (beef, chicken) is a bit dry. We enjoyed the popiah, rozak, chicken rice, duck, but most of these local food may be obtained from the hawker's center without paying so much. I would give the food a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the best)

We were taken,as a family group of 4, to this restaurant by our son,who was in Singapore for the second part of his marriage to his Singaporean bride.It was a surprise for us after a day of sightseeing together.The whole experience was one of the most amazing eating experiences I've ever had. Imagine being able to try cuisines/dishes that you might be careful about ordering a la carte, just in case you didn't like it. I was able to try many different dishes, just serving myself enough for a taste, as I could always go back for more.I was really keen to try Asian desserts, which were (a) made from unknown ingredients (b)very brightly coloured! I also wanted to try some unusual fruits.I found that durian icecream and soursop gelati are divine, and dragon fruit looks pretty but tastes like nothing!!The table service was impeccable-plates etc cleared quietly and efficiently (though remember to keep your cutlery- strange...) and our waitress offered suggestions to try as we tucked in to each new dish (as well as some old favourites).I suggest that you take care with the quantity you serve yourself, as this experience is a marathon, not a sprint, if you want to take full advantage of the offerings.I can't advise as to costs, as our son insisted on paying and wouldn't tell us how much
5
This restaurant is sinful as the food variety is truly amazing. You can choose from hawker style roti prata to traditional western, Chinese food and full service of waffles and pancakes etc etc. one of the best buffets I have ever experienced in the world. Service is also excellent
5
If you are into trying every bit of local food, this is the one stop place to it. High quality of food. It can be very crowded at lunch time, so come early. The food here is certified halal so muslim can feel happy to eat anything...I brought my parents here and they were happy
5
The buffet spread is reasonable for the price but what is a buffet without drinks section.. If you want to taste authentic local foods in a clean upscale environment. This is it! The service was great.
4
Food was good with better quality ingredients, but also reflected in the prices. Nice dinning area for a more cleaned up version of a hawker's market.

Friends and I had been trying for sometime to organise a visit to the Straits Kitchen at the Grand Hyatt in Scotts Rd Singapore after a friend highly recommending it, and the fact that it was halal.We arrived at 6.30 to be met with what is the typical 6.30 pm buffet rush. The food was OK, usual Singaporean fare, including satay, Indian and Malay food. Most of the offerings were nothing special and could be equally found at local haunts. The crab though was very nice, if not messy (had to ask for a finger bowl), and the fish was very, very nice. Service was fine - but you mostly left to your own. Soft drinks were ridiculously priced - $7 for a coke. Note, even though halal, alcohol is available. The booth seats are a little difficult to get in and out of. Total cost, with 2 cokes and the usual taxes for four was $230. I wouldn't bother going back
5
I wanted to take my two teenagers to one buffet meal during a short visit to Singapore.We had been to Raffles high tea previously and really enjoyed it but wanted something different.Tried researching on the internet and couldn't choose.A very nice taxi driver recommended Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt and it was excellent.The location was an easy walk from our hotel (York Hotel).You need to book which I did by telephone.There are a number of stations where you can see chefs preparing local food and they are happy to explain things to you.The Indian section was our favourite, great choice of varied Indian dishes.. They have a tandoori oven and a large round hotplate where they cook naan and murtabak while you watch.There are also sections of Chinese food (roast chicken and duck, made to order soup noodles), Indonesian food (popiah/ gadogado made to order, rojak) and Malaysian food (barebecued chicken/prawns, traditional satay you can watch being prepared).There are fresh fruit juices included as well as a la carte drinks.For dessert there is fresh fruit and local desserts as well as ice creams/sorbets with a local flavour and my daughter's favourite ice kachang but gourmet style.To cater to Muslim guests the restaurant is halal; no pork.The food and service were great.The chefs were happy to explain the food.At 44 SGD ++ I thought it was great value.I would go back if I have the chance
3
If you are looking for a true Singapore food experience you will be much better off going to one of Singapore's many traditional hawker centers. We went as a large family group for dinner recently. Dinner cost a princely sum of $50 ++ a person. Food was good but not outstanding. Drinks (not even coffee or tea) was included in the price of the buffet! Service was mediocre and no better than at an average hawker centre, (perhaps it was part of the effort to make the experience "authentic".)The Straits Kitchen is grossly over rated. Will we go again - no. Would we recommend it to anyone else - no.
3
We booked the restaurant during Christmas eve.We thought perhaps a buffet with local and western food will be great.We were given second seating and that was fine cos it was eve of Christmas. Reception and waiter service was good. In fact our waiter, an indian guy was great!The food choices were fine. However, we find the chinese food station below standard. The laksa was diluted and without taste. ;(We could not open teh crab cos it was not shell was not cracked for ease of consumption...we did inform the chinese waiter but she could not understand English...maybe she is not chinese...but Asian chinese looking lady....we thought at least basic English must be there for service staff in Singapore?????The Turkey was ok but limited cos the chef will carve a small slice for you...pathetic. We have to ask for more. We had to go back 3 times to get an overall taste of our favorite item.;(The stuffing was poor...maybe we do not know what it was....;( There were no label for the food items so we have to aks teh chef. Some were nice but some were not too happy we asked many questions.We like the chef at the India station. He took time to explain the dishes to us and also offer to refill the crackers..papadum we love for us. He was great!The rest of the stations' chef was just doing their job..no Xmas greetings. As this belongs to Hyatt hotel, we were disappointed.Hyatt needs to wake up instead of being complacent. Basic service must be followed through.
4
We had a buffet lunch there and it was excellent for focused experience of all local specialties you could imagine - I will not try to recall allof the exotic names, but rest assured, there will be almost everything, except oyster omelette, probably. But thats not a big loss. Taste-wise I presume everything was excellent, even it was quite far from my preferences or something I'd like to try again (like durrian ice-cream). Price is a bit steep 44 SGD per adult plus all service and taxes (on top - 7 USD for coca cola, but some softdrinks are included), but location is perfect - stone through from all major shopping malls (ION, etc) and service is very goodReservation would be a good ide
3
The buffet spread is reasonable for the price but what is a buffet without drinks section. Drinks are a separate bill + the exorbitant price will make this restaurant a place I will never come to again. Clearing of plates has always been slow or prompted. Maybe Gordon Ramsey can give them some tips
5
I took the family to the straits kitchen the other night. Reservation is needed and recommended. The food and service were excellent. If you want to taste authentic local foods in a clean upscale environment. This is it! The service was great. All of us were stuffed by the end of the night
5
We decided to go to Singapore this Xmas and booked at the Hyatt. We picked the Straitskitchen for Xmas lunch. Booking online was no problems at all. We were seated at a great table and then proceeded to eat too much. :-) The food was fantastic. For someone who does not have a good view as to what we should have been served, we thought the buffet gave a great varied selection. Started at one end of the open kitchen and worked our way along it. It took some time and many visits but was really worth it. The staff were fantastic. Could not fault our visit in any way. And to top it off, if you have time, check out the decor, especially the use of timber. I believe it was designed by a Japanese gentleman and the use everyday objects is great
4
The food served here are as titled - Local!
Food of the local ethnicities are found here, served under the lovely ambience of the Straits Kitchen. Loved the food, loved the place. Staffs are friendly and genuine.
5
Straitskitchen would appeal to tourists who want to taste Asian food at one go. My favourites are the nan, grilled fish, oyster omelette, satay and popiah. Don't forget to try their wide array of desserts like the crunchy banana fritters! Yummy! The service is always good and the atmosphere is lovely.
5
Went to this resto based upon tripadvisor reviews & boy, we did not regret it..... Had our buffet dinner there.... What can I say, foods were (all) yummy (the one I've tried--- wasn't able to sample everything though) & well-presented. Staffs were friendly & nice! Loved the Ambience & atmosphere of this restaurant.... Looking forward to my next visit --- if going to SG again...
4
The last time we were here was for lunch buffet on the first day of Chinese New Year some 3 years ago. It left us with such an impression that we have decided to make it our first stop this time. This time around we have brought some friends locally and our 18 months daughter.The chicken rice was all the little-one could eat but I am sure she enjoyed it much. As I was recovering from a bad cold, and a sensitive thorax, I couldn't quite enjoy the spicy food on offer, which happens to be the majority of savory choices on offer. But I am sure the quality was up to the local standard, complimented by our friends. All in all, a good meal. The durian ice cream is a must try! Please note, tea / coffee is not included, in case you are used to the HK way of buffet
5
My favorite restaurant in Singapore for breakfast/brunch. I have repeatedly recommended it to anyone I know who goes/is going to Singapore. I had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt on more than a few occasions in Singapore and was stunned to see this restaurant located within this beautiful, business-travel friendly hotel.The reason? Awesome food from many locations, China, Malaysia, India, and Indonesia, all freshly prepared at various stations, with fresh pressed tropical and standard juices, making this one of the most wonderful breakfast buffet choices I've ever encountered. Anywhere.OK maybe not every single dish was noteworthy, the Chinese dishes come to mind as not my favorites, but with SO MUCH to choose from, from standard US breakfast fare to the more exotic Asian blends, the lesser dishes fade into the background. This is probably not inexpensive (I was traveling on business Per Diem) but the experience was great and was every time I went (which was 4 times).So if you are fortunate to visit this Grand Hyatt, you owe it to yourself to visit StraitsKitchen at least once. I'm pretty certain, you will not regret it.Oh and the coffee's good too. :
5
We frequently do short stop-overs in Singapore en route between Australia / Europe. The Straits Kitchen buffet lunch at the Grand Hyatt is a wonderful experience to sample great local food, presented beautifully in a clean, modern, stylish and 5 star environment. I have been many times and will go again. One could perhaps go more authentically to the various street food vendors around the city - and this buffet restaurant tries to re-create that in the hotel context - in my view very successfully. The curries, Indonesian dishes, Chinese, and Malay food are all delicious and the staff warm and genuine. All washed down with beautiful fresh mango juice and perhaps some durian ice cream to finish (or not). A wonderful experience
5
A must-do for visitors to Singapore who want to sample all of the various cuisines and dishes of Singapore. From otak-otak and sates, to curries and nasi - and even durian - it's all here and it is exceptionally good!. The Indian curries are among the best I have tasted. The restaurant was full of locals for the most part, always a good endorsement. This is a buffet, but Asian style - the food is superb. Skip the hawker centres (the food is almost always ordinary) and come straight here. Highly recommended
5
Loved this place. A huge selection of different cuisines and in each section a great selection of foods. Brilliant service. Great tasting food. Delightful juice bar. Great dessert section - must try the local shaved iced dessert with rose syrup - heavenly. Serves halal food.Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Would definitely eat here again. We did try to book this place by phone and they told us they were fully booked. We went down anyway to try get a table (it was only round the corner from the Four Seasons) - there were lots of tables free...could have missed out had we not check for ourselves!Highly recommended.
5
I often had breakfast at this place and I have always been satisfied each time. They serve some of the best bread in the world, especially its croissant. The choice of western breakfast items are extensive, which includes cereals, muesli, cold cuts, etc.Then there are the dishes from different cultures in Singapore like Malay's nasi lemak, Indian dishes and Chinese influenced noodles, dim sum, etc. There are so many choices that it's impossible to try even a little bit of each in one seating.In addition to breakfast, this place also serves excellent lunch and dinner buffets as well as all day dining
4
I had recently been to straits kitchen with a few friends, one had a Bday. the place has this whole weird charm to it. people are great and service is top notch. food - great variety specially for all you carnivores out there. for vegetarians - fewer options, that was my only issue with the place, not too many veg options outside of indian cuisine (it was multi cuisine place) and would love to see more options for herbivores.. :
5
Took a group here as there is something for everyone. Food is always amazing and a great way to try new things. The curry is especiallly good.
5
Been here with family and guests to Singapore many times. Good value, great quality and a wonderful choice of local food. For guests a great introduction to Chicken Rice, Massaman curry, popiah, Indian and other foods. The buffet is our favourite in Sing.
4
Worth a visit occasionally and always consistent but over priced by the time you factor in drinks etc.
4
They have all the asian food designed in a "prim and proper" manner, with a nice, refined presentation of Singapore's national food.
I read a lot about their durian-based dessert, it's only until I have tried it myself I can agree with everyone else: Superb.
4
This place is good fun, I would bring a more "upscale" tourist here who has limited time in Singapore. It's in a nice hotel on the main Orchard Rd stretch. If you happen to be on a short trip and staying in the Orchard Rd areas and want to try a range of local food in air-condition comfort, this is the equivalent of a "hawker centre" in a hotel. It's buffet style and good fun walking from "stall" to "stall" ordering fresh food. The cooks could probably explain to you in English what their dish is and what it consists of.It is also halal.
5
my family and i had a great dinner here back in October 2012. I had a terrific malay kueh (traditional malay cakes), indian dishes, singaporean/malaysian dishes, chinese dishes, seafood etc. the chili crab was fantastic,my sister and i just could not stop but we had to.what impressed me a lot is the choices of traditional cakes. as far as i know, food here is certified halal. indian dishes are just like the original food in india.staff are nice and helpful.i can say it's worth the price
4
One stop shop for a complete Singaporean food experience without the hassles of finding a place to seat or queuing up for food. Fine range of food, very good quality and decently priced (considering its inside a Hyatt Hotel). Must make reservations a day in advance to avoid disappointment.
3
Went to try this restaurant because of the reviews here but found the food not exceptional as they serve ordinary food that we could find in many other places and the quality is average. I found the roast duck good with crispy skin but then surprisingly when my sister took hers, it was not the same at all...Like the lamb biryani because the basmati rice was tasty and moist...and the popiah freshly made.....The satays were hard once they turned cold...in short they have most of the local fare including the desserts but average quality...The service and ambiance is good and the staff helpful...
4
Coming back to Straits Kitchen is something to look forward to. I love the delicious food and the good ambiance. Unlike last time I was here, this time I really put an empty stomach to ensure I had enough place for all the food, and also to ensure I had value to what I spent, since this is not a cheap place to go. Chili crabs, prawns etc that I love to eat are there waiting for me!. Like before, I am using my bare hands to eat! I was a bit disappointed that I could not get more varieties of appetizers. They have good tea tarik and I enjoyed my dinner with my family. Hoping to go there again
5
they have almost everything, even durian ice cream, which is the mildest way to try this crazy fruit. basically it's chinese/hokkien, indian and malay food. They have different stations and you can try them all, the indian station has fresh naan being made, you want chili crab, it's in there, chicken rice? IT'S THERE!, so really nice place to enjoy in a nutshell what singapore has to offer, only downside is that since it's a buffet (downside?), you don't value it as much as it would be a la carte, maybe it's psychological, but if hungry for singaporean food is what you are, then this is it
5
Always busy because the food is great.
stop in mid-afternoon for tea.
They have great Sencha and fresh exotic fruits for a "healthy" tea session.
4
Lovely breakfast experience with kitchens from all over the region; the best way to approach the different cooks and specialities of Singapore (Indian, Chinese, Malay)
5
nice Asian variety of food esp during the lunch buffets. Can be very crowded. We went for seminars and lunch as part of the program. Its pricy but worth it.
5
Food service standards equal to only edge restaurant at Pan Pacific. Chefs were great, and service was prompt and helpful - except for the delivery of our wine which took about 15 minutes. Understand its a halal restaurant and not a great deal of wine is sold but if you offer it needs to be prompt when you're paying this much
5
What a treat for any foodie...if you love delicious food and have a hearty appetite then this is the place for you. An endless supply of perfectly cooked, fresh food, every dish a delight. Chinese, Japanese, Indian - it's all available. Fresh fruit juiced to order, spring rolls made just as you want them. It's always busy so it's best to book. A fantastic way to celebrate with friends, that way you can share lots of different dishes. It may seem expensive, but the quality and quantity make it worth the money
4
I ate at the breakfast buffet two days. An international selection of foods. Friendly service.I say that this place is very good but not outstanding because I just came from Hong Kong and stayed at the Island Shangri La and ate at Cafe Too. That restaurant has the exact same approach, but I found the food preparation and quality at Cafe Too just a bit better
5
just go and try.. breakfast, lunch or dinner. my only complaint is that the venue is too small and noisy... but the selection of food - my god, is excellent. From Malay to Chinese to Indian to Western.. all Singaporean/Malaysian food! Been having breakfast here since 2007.
5
Are you craving for Singaporean food? Are you hungry? If you answer yes to these two question, come to Straits Kitchen! The food is great and you get your doze of chicken rice/ hokkien mie/ roast duck/ curry/ prata/ laksa/ etc. in a nice place. I think they focus on Chinese, Malay, and Indian food. All these dishes are done really well for a buffet standard. I can say that they have quality. They serve some sushi but not memorable for me. As I said, this is the place when you want to eat lots of Singaporean delights in a clean and cool atmosphere
4
We found Straits Kitchen a number of years ago amd used to frequent quite regularly but stopped as it became increasing hard to get a seat without booking well in advance. It has been about a year since my recent visit.The food is still good, with a good variety of Malay, Indian and local Chinese dishes and free flow of selected juices. After being away for a while, I did notice that the quality has gone down somewhat- eg the freshly-made popiah lacks flavour- I should have noticed that the usually long queues were oddly absent. The roast duck seemed a tad dry and tough. And there was strangely no queues at the satay area.Despite the slight disappointment, I would still go back, as it's a great place to sample a eaide variety of local food in small doses in a comfortable place without having to order one of everything at of course higher prices than at a hawker centre or food court. This has been and still is the place to bring my overseas friends who want to try local food.Note: if you are having a birthday celebration, the staf will gather around to join in the fun- although it seems they no longer break out into birthday songs. And any birthday cake brought into the restaurant needs to be bought from a Halal-certified shop
4
Conveniently located at Hyatt Hotel, Orchard Road, it is easily accessible via most public transport. A good choice of local delicacies from different ethnic groups in Singapore. Well recommended for anyone to visit but may need to call up to make reservation as it can be quite crowded even on Weekdays
4
one of the best buffet spreads in the orchard area. especially enjoyed the ramdhan buffet breakfast.
4
Any Asian food you want is available here. Please come with empty stomach as all food provided are must try and tasted so delicious! Price also average, very attentive servant, overall great experience of dining
3
Has a good variety but prices are a bit steep at $52++. They are, after all, hawker food gathered in one place!
4
I am writting this as an American visiting Singapore. First off a very popular place. Doors open at 18:30 and they place filled in quickly with very large tables of peope; a mix of seemingly visitors and locals.Though very good food they could make a single, vast improvement by individually labling the foods on the buffet stations. They have a list at each station but you have to guess whats what on a very big table/counter. Having said that I am not sure I will be doing dinner here again as once was enough for me but I see why its near the top of the list for Singapore. The service was a bit slow BUT the place was crowded.Let me review breakfast while I am here. The hotel caters to Asian travelers way more than westerners from my observation so I understand and enjoy the various Asian breakfast specialties BUT the only western breakfast offerings is a substandard egg station. I am not asking for the breakfast buffet at an american Four Seasons BUT more could be done. The breakfast at the Marriott next door is much much better albiet more expensive.For the Asian traveler I think this might be an above avaerage breakfast but for an American below average BUT I cant rate it based on that and I give it a 'Very Good'.
4
fantastic spread of food and a great one price concept. Downside is is encourages overeating every time :-(.The staff at Hyatt generally are very good so service is great.The desert spread is a bit limited if you are craving for some wester deserts. I would want to see a soft drink also included in the price of the buffet.All in all a great asian experience
5
We all loved the Straits Kitchen, especially the kids. They loved being able to wander around choosing from the large display of different local Singaporean dishes on offer, not having to worry so much if they would like what they chose or not as it is buffet style. The food was very god quality and the price was reasonable for what you get. Worth hunting this place out when in town
4
You can find almost all the favourite local Singapore hawker food in this place but you will probably not find too many locals (or none) here. The quality of food is acceptable for a 5* hotel standard and the ambience is great... at a price. That said, it is an ideal place to bring visitors to if you don't have the time to bring them to a hawker center to try a variety of local dishes at one go, if you don't like the hot/not-so-clean hawker center environment, if you want to impress and if you are willing to pay
4
The Straits Kitchen is an awesome place to dine along with family members. The big spread of local food here is a great experience for any visitor in town to boast about to their friends and family back home. Thats of course after such a visitor were to try all that is on display on the platter. Tasty food, reasonable pricing, fantastic ambience and great service makes this place a big hit for locals and visitors alike. Keep up the good work Straits Kitchen
3
This buffet restaurant has got a lot of variety and different food from Asia and Middle East but beside the variety, food quality is nothing special. The fact is that you pay a lot of money for very standard food, hawker stall style, and there's a lack of "luxury" food like tiger prawns, oysters, lobster and so on..., furthermore the black pepper crab tasted weird (sticky and sugary). If you are a meat lover choices are better but if you are a very big fan of seafood as I am try something else
4
I would consider this place as one of my fave buffet in singapore. I think dinner is better lunch because they have more selection including the Crab!! So definitely worthed :) My recommendation dishes are : satay, tahu telor, black peper crab, roasted duck, ice kachang and goreng pisang !! Ice kachang is really original and goreng pisang is really one of the best Ive tried in SG
5
It was hot when we went to Singapore and we wanted to eat Singapore-Malay fare that's equally hot. This is the place to be! I liked the satay, lak sa, Indian food and the natural juices. The dessert spread was also excellent.
4
love the hawker style but full of variety spread and lots of local food!
4
Really enjoyed it. The natural fruit juices were lovely. Only negative was that some of the food was served (intentionally) lukewarm, I like my food a little hotter.
5
Awesome asian food buffet. Definitely the best asian buffet in Singapore. If there was any restaurant that you could go to to get the full taste of Singapore. this would be the one. Please make a reservation early!
5
A group of us ate here mid-week last week & we were impressed. This restaurant has a big floor space & yet it was full for dinner, early, before 7. Lots to choose from the buffet spread. You'll like it !!
5
this buffet is one of the best...has got so many local dishes. be sure to empty your stomach before coming here. There's indian, malay, chinese and even eurasian dishes here... true singaporean buffet and it's halal.
5
If you like hawker food but don't have enough time or stomach space to try all types of Singaporean food, this is a good stop to sample small portions. This gives you an idea what laksa tastes like, why pineapple tarts are a hit here, etc. i usually take visitors from aboard here and would give this place rave reviews anytime
4
The dinner session at this restaurant offer a "singapore food" buffet with cuisines principally from Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and India. Each cuisine has a dedicated station backed up by an open kitchen that continuously replenish the food. While the quality of the food is good, you will find better quality food at restaurants that specialise in a particular cuisine.Having said that, the choice of food is very excellent and they do provide some of the most popular and readily associated foods from each cuisine such as th satay, singapore chili crab, tandoori chicken etc.The dessert spread was in my view a not as impressive but a good selection. The service is brisk and they clear plates and replenish cutlery while you head off to partake in a fresh helping. Given that this food is best eaten if you are able to use your hands as well and not just cutlery, it was no surprise that a majority of the diners were families
4
Straits Kitchen delights with a casual and upscale hawker centre experience in a class hotel location. You can sample food from the many different ethnic influences that make Singapore such an interesting melting pot. Glide easily between different chinese food styles, malay, thai, indian and uniquely Singaporean fare that fuses all of the above. It's a buffet with a twist as you walk from food stand to food stand, ordering up what pleases the eye and nose. Naan bread custom made with some garlic and shallots...no problem. Nasi goreng with a certain spice...yep. Satay cooked right in front of you as they fan the flames to get the heat just right...check.It's casual, fun and different. Normally one wouldn't find their way to a Hyatt for dinner, but when in Singapore, it's a great way to go with food options for any taste. Take a group, take a date, but go
5
Following Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations Singapore episode, we came to this restaurant for a culinary experience. Straits Kitchen did not disappoint. There were several buffet stations, each specializes in a particular cuisine - Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, Nonya, and Indian. There was also a juice bar with exotic fruits and a dessert station with all sorts of shaved ice, kueh, and tarts. You will need to spend hours here in order to try every single dish. Dinner is $52++ and lunch is $44++ - excellent value for money! This is the best place to try all the hawker favourites and local foods. Mind you, though, that it is a very busy restaurant, so the service can be a let down
5
Really good spin through singaporean cuisine! Tasty and very fresh!
5
I like this restaurant for it's seeming intention to take local favorites and make them with the best ingredients using great chefs and the end product is delicious.
5
All I can say is wow, only negative things it's extremely crowded at peak times so go early,
5
This buffet has all that you could desire in one location. The food is of a high standard and there is a vast variety of Asian cuisine. The staff are friendly and you can eat til your heart's desire. The mango pudding was a great dessert. All you could want to eat whilst in Singapore.
3
My husband and my 3kids visited straits kitchen last week for buffet lunch and we were surprisingly disappointed with the quality of the food. Variety of food was there but quality of food as in taste, was mediocre. With all the great reviews I had read on straits kitchen, we were really let down. If u're Malaysian especially sarawakians, please don't bother going here unless u need a fancy place to 'cheat' 'ah mohs'! No pun intended..the restaurant has a nice ambience And service staff was efficient but food was just mediocre. Highly overrated..

huge selection but struggled to find lots of veggies unless they were curried, on the other hand the juicing bar had them all so got them in a glass, this wasn't included in the buffet cost though. everything we tried we loved, kids found lots to taste and test and the various flavours of rice and different ways they were cooked blew them away! found it a bit expensive for what we had but in fairness we were not starving getting there either and would probably have gotten more value for money if we went in hungry. for 2 adults and 4 children we paid almost 500 SGD for the buffet but a veggie juice, 2 beers and a champagne (by the glass) were added to the buffet cost. overall a lovely experience, great opportunity to try the flavours and spices of singapore in small doses and would recommend it
5
If you want to try a taste of everything Singapore. This is the best restaurant to do so. I was amazed at how many types of food they offer at the buffet and it's perfect if you really want to sample the local cuisine. I'm personally not too big on shellfish but was able to try many of the different local dishes and still have ample options. I promise you will leave full and satisfied.

Good place for casual dining, entertaining clients or family gathering. Straits Kitchen has a good variety of local favorites ranging from Chinese, Malay, Indian and Nyonya cuisines like Hainanese chicken rice, noodles, pratas, curry, popiahs and a variety of fresh fruits. The housemade ice-creams are nice. With flavors like coconut and mango
4
Straits kitchen offered all the hawker food in one luxurious environment (and price). You can sample almost everything from satay to tropical fruits and fresh juices. It is a great place to start a visit in Singapore as welll as to bring your foreign guests who may not be comfortable with the hawker offerings. I had all my favorites - hainanese chicken; prawn mee; satay; seafood dumpling soup, pepper crab; roast duck; chendol and many local favorites. The food was great
4
Absolutely first rate & thoroughly to be recommended! I have a suspicion it was horribly expensive but it was fab, huge choice & all immaculately cooked. We were treated so I daren't think about the cost - but I did my best to eat as much as I could! The dry ice gin & lime creams were awesome! If you are on expenses this is reckoned to be the best brunch on the island!
5
Ambience very good, good and polite service staff. Prices are reasonable. Regardless of races, foods choices ranging from Chinese, Malays, Indians, Peranakan, Americans are not been left out. Good choices for tourists and the locals.
5
I love the food here. Staff is good about making items vegetarian, beyond what is listed on the menu. They can increase the spice level if needed, if you ask. Quick service. Nice, casual atmosphere.
4
The restaurant interior is amazing, wall decorations using clay pots, glass and stone. Food is okay, lots of selections representing some of asian cuisine, but its is not as spicy as it should be. Staff is very efficient and proactive.
5
I highly recommend this restaurant to those who want to have an exhaustive flavour of what Asian cuisine in general can offer.The service is of good quality. Even though it can be crowded at times, I had a great time there enjoying all sorts of food in a cosy setting
4
We had a very nice lunch with all the local delights you can find in Singapore!very tasty food, attentive service and well priced. and the spread is huge, so take your time to go trough all the different cuisines offered. they also serve fresh chilled juices, rest of the drink are a la carte and are chargeable
4
Love this place… incredibly delicious and abundant food. Although this is a hotel buffet-style restaurant, it does have a nice, cosy atmosphere.A fantastic way to experience the very best of Straits cooking in a single location, in a single meal. One tip… skip lunch(!)… you’ll want to save the room
5
Anytime we are in Singapore, we stop at least for one meal at this lovely and very busy restaurant. The food is great and the service very attentive and the variety of food is one of the best in town. This restaurant is a great choice if you want to sample all the various Singaporean food styles under one roof and the Hyatt has done an amazing job to create an atmosphere that attracts locals, tourists and businessmen alike. It is a crowded restaurant and reservations are recommended
3
If you are from way out of town and don't mind splashing about S$55 ++ per head then this is a must go. Locals, like me, will be disappointed in the tough satay meat, average pepper crab and truly truly expensive sugar cane or fruit juices. The raised prices does not cover the drinks while in the past it did. It shows the extent of inflation and cost cutting. The ones not to be missed, however, are the char kway teow, desserts (too many to name), rojak, chye tow kway and the yong tow foo. The rest are incredibly ordinary especially the Indian food. I won't be back anytime soon. Again locals who want to treat important foreign guests will find this ideal for friterring away your expense account (if you have one) and may well land you the deal
5
For those who wanted to have a great sample of local singaporean cuisine but don't want to eat at various hawker centers, MUST give Straits Kitchen a try. You will not be dissapointed! Very good satay, great fried carrot cakes, great chicken rice, excellent indian dishes and wonderful and refreshing fruit juices, just to name a few. Dinner buffet has much better selection but lunch is excellent as well
5
I just reviewed our favourite singapore restaurant mezza9 -also in Hyatt ( no i do NOT work for the group - just a frequent guest) and that reminded me of Straits Kitchen - a fantastic place for Asian cuisine - lots of stalls with freshly prepared " street food" of impeccaple quality. Dont miss the satay - you may have to wait a little but it is worth it - best in singapore from what we have trie
5
This is a great restaurant in Singapore. Great atmosphere, food and service.
5
Wide variety of fantastic and authentic food from all over south east Asia. Very attentive staff. Reservations highly recommended. Really Very Very good. I would rate it as the best multi cuisine eatery I have ever visited.
5
We went to Singapore mostly to eat and chose Straits kitchen as our first meal. It had a wonderful selection of local cuisine. I cant vouch for the authenticity but as far as taste goes it was a fantastic dining experience.
4
A delicious buffet with three different cuisines..Thai, Chinese, and Singaporean/malayan. Regardless of your palate, the food is well-prepared and excellent; the service is friendly, efficient. If you are adventurous, you'll have some dishes that you've never tasted before, and you'll go back for more.
4
We were invited by friends to share a breakfast at Straits Kitchen, so we were with 2 families with 5 children. It was nice, you have a lot of choices also for the children, nice staff (friendly and helpfull). The children were a bit cold because of the aircon. So bring a scarf or a thin vest
5
This restaurant in the GHS provides a great opportunity to provide 3 distinct cuisines: Malay, Chinese, and Indian. The dinner buffet is quite reasonably priced (about $40 USD), as long as you avoid the typically expensive alcoholic beverages. Staff were friendly and greeted us by name, and we enjoyed the opportunity to taste so many of the flavors of Singapore, including durian ice cream, which smells and tastes like it was strained through the socks of a college freshman. If you're looking for an introduction to the foods of Singapore in an admittedly somewhat sanitized environment, this is your place
4
I must admit, I was a bit out of my comfort zone dining here. I went to the dinner buffet which is extensive. Honestly, I do not know what the majority of what I ate was! The staff was great and one of the woman took me around and pointed out what was spicy... I am a wimp. One of my favorite surprises was the popiah... delicious! Overall a great dining experience
4
we always take our friends from abroad when they want a taste of 'Singaporean' cuisine minus the slightly daunting experience of visiting a non-air conditioned hawker centre. at times, it's a little overcrowded (which in a way mirrors the real hawker experience!) so avoid the weekend lunchtimes if possible. the indian is especially good, considering how most of the dishes are catered to foreign palates
4
Says something that on numerous visits to Singapore and so many dining choices, we always manage to fit in Straits Kitchen!Of course, it's not cheap, around Â£83 inc tax for 2 of us, ( buffet price doesn't include drinks, not even tea/coffee/juices, which is a little mean, hence not 5 stars!)But what you get is choice and all in one place. Our favourite local 'eats' are beef rendang, carrot cake. char kway teow, chicken rice...actually how can you choose, try it all!!Warning, don't eat breakfast or lunch and take it slow
3
I think this place is strictly for tourists who find hawker centers too unsanitary, hot and just plain scary. Here, you will find local cuisine customized to the foreign palate, with lard, fish sauce, chili and other scary condiments and ingredients either left out or used in sparing portions. It might not be the real experience, but it is undoubtedly a more digestible one for our foreign friends
4
Great choice of local street fare in a great cosy hotel
4
Great selection of popular local dishes. The food is tasty and fresh. Pretty good value for money if you have a big appetite or want to try a little bit of everything. Great service and nice buzz to the atmosphere as well.
5
Street food served in the comfort of a hotel restaurant.
4
Massive selection across a number of nationalities.
5
there is a huge range of asian foods of good quality, in particular the indian food is excellent, and the desserts are great. however, as it is very popular you really need to book beforehand
3
If you want the real local Singapore food experience, skip the hotels and head straight for the hawker centres. Don't waste your time at Straits Kitchen. The food's not too bad, but you can get it at a quarter of the price elsewhere.
5
nice selections and friendly staff. all the food is edible:)
3
Straits Kitchen has a well-decorated space and a great assortment of different food styles to explore. Most things were quite tasty. If anything, there were almost too many choices and it was hard to decide where to start.Drinks staff were poor - no or incorrect knowledge about the drinks available. Very slow to take orders, and slow to bring drinks out, which were then wrong in a few cases (i.e. not what we ordered). Similar problem for fresh fruit juice ordered from different staff - slow, and completely wrong juice delivered.Worst part was when we went to pay the bill. Six people in our group wanted to pay by credit card, and it literally took in excess of 1.5 hours to settle the bill, despite at least two staff working on it. Rediclously poor service in a venue like this, embarrassingly bad service experience for visitors to Singapore from many overseas locations
3
As a local who eats local fare more often at coffeshops, food centres, food courts or home cooked, I personally find the food served at Straits Kitchen fairly average. For the price you pay, I think it is better to eat local food at the coffeeshops, hawker centres or food courts. That said, the ambience at Straits Kitchen is of course different from what you will experience at the coffeeshops, hawker centres and food courts; it is definitely more comfortable with the air con and minus all the smoke. If you want to try almost (all) the local fare in one seating in small amounts, then Straits Kitchen is the place to go to as you can find all the local favourites being served - Malay, Indian, Chinese food etc - such as chicken rice, satay, prata etc and the desserts too
5
Although it is more expensive than what you can get outside... but there is no way u can get all in one place. It is not easy to get halal roasted duck as tasty as at Straits Kitchen and their Indian selection is really good. I only wish they have better selection of desserts... I prefer cakes instead of the traditional kuehs
5
At $55++, its worth every penny. Has nice ambience. Perfect set up to bring your date out on a special occassion. Its has variety with asian mediterannean and western cuisine. Buffet set up.
4
Loved the crabs and all other hawker dishes like the Char Kuey Tiao :)
3
compared to the local street food, it loses color. but as a meal, it is indeed delicious. no complaint about it....
3
Reasonable price for the food selection available.
4
For once a hotel delivers on the quality of food. It's not table service though and is pretty pricey
5
I am sure the prohibitively expensive dinner is equally fabulous, but my review is specific to the Breakfast.
The buffet selections were tremendous and ultra-high-quality. Juice bar was great, and coffee service was prompt and friendly. There are multiple breakfast cuisines to choose from....top shelf!
3
This is where I will bring visitors to feast on local delights. Although the same can be found in local Hawker Centres at a fraction of the price, the location and comfort here attracts most of my friends who are not accustomed to local weather (heat and humidity
3
Had dinner with a few company colleagues after meetings the whole day. The food was good and the variety indeed reflected the broad array of offerings Singapore is famous for. There was chicken rice, popiah, prawn noodles, laksa and so much more. There were the Indian favourites of butter chicken, tandoori chicken, nasi biryani. Malay and Western favourites were also well represented. The quality of the food was fine as I said but for the price that we paid, I did not really think it was such good value. One could go to a hawker center and savour all these same dishes at a fraction of the price. Now of course the hawker center does not have the ambience or the "be seen" factor the Straits Kitchen has but as I come from a more meager background, let's just say I don't put too much value to that. Would rather get the most bang for my hard earned bucks. In this instance, the company paid for the meal, but if I was paying, would rather go to a food court or to the nearest hawker center. At least in some of the other hotel buffets, you get dishes such as sushi, sashimi and fresh oysters that may be difficult to come by in a hawker center. No such dishes at Straits Kitchen
5
This is a beautifully designed and fit out hotel restaurant with high quality versions of all the standard Asia cuisine you find in Singapore - Malaysian, Chinese, Thai, Indian, etc.We actually went here for a work Chinese New Year lunch. We had the lunch buffet (41 Sing dollars ) which I have a feeling is the best way to experience SK. With all the options to try and the fresh juices, which alone would cost much more than the buffet.Sure, you can have more authentic versions of these dishes in the street, at hawker markets, in China Town or Little India, for less than a quarter of the price. But if you are shopping up a storm on Orchard road or are with people who more precious about the less formal options - SK is a great safe option
5
Great place to go for a sampling of regional cuisine. We showed up without a reservation and talked our way in. Everything is freshly made and they will even make something for you if it is missing (someone in our party asked for a local noodle dish which they gladly made). Not a fancy or pretentious scene. Good place to go with another couple or 2. You can linger as long as you want and make a great night out of it. Only down side is there is no view. It is the lobby of a hotel..
5
The ambience and the spread is an awesome treat to the senses!
4
If you are looking for food variety, this is one place that you should try. Starting from local selection to international. Even the ice cream is local flavour!
5
Another of the many buffet style restuarants that are available and much loved in Singapore. Enjoyed watching the hard work being put in by the chefs who prepare most of the food in view of their patrons.
4
Course of food with local asian fusion, great place to be with colleagues, family and friends!
5
The buffet served by Straits Kitchen - whether breakfast, lunch or dinner - caters for all tastes. The specialist chefs provide authentic regional dishes. The breakfast is a perfect way to fuel your adventures for the day.
4
Great food, good service. What more to say? Will head back there soon with my dearest and my precious. : )
4
We love the food spread.. esp the Indian Food! Yummy! They were well prepared. We dont have to wait too long for each dish. Cooks were friendly. Servers were a little slow and spend too much time serving the foreigners and 'forgotten' about the local. Maybe they should improve on that. But overall it was a great nite
5
The variety of food during fasting month was amazing and you got all sorts of Asian food, dessert as well as juices. I hate to missed having my breakfasting here but need to make sure that reservations are made well in advance (as it is always fully booked
5
Lunch at Straits Kitchen was the best meal I have had in Singapore -- and in terms of choice, quality and quantity it rivals most meals anywhere. The incredible variety of tasty food -- prepared while you wait by good chefs -- Malay, Singaporean, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian -- and the ability to mix and match, made this special
5
Watched an episode of "No Reservations" with Tony Bourdain , when he ate here. We've visited many places he's dined at, and he's right on. Lovely, warm, atmosphere serving a wonderful and delicious variety of Indian, Malay, and Chinese. Especially loved the roasted juicy duck and chicken. Dessert selection was a little weak. The chefs take pride in their cooking and they are helpful and friendly. Stations are very clean and neat. Lots of locals. That says a lot! Since it is located in the Hyatt, there are lots of tourists too.  Warning! Beer will set you back 18.USD Make reservation week in advance. Would definitely return
5
Best restaurant in Singapore! Cannot say enough wonderful things about Straits Kitchen. Love the Indian food especially.
3
I ordered the local Beef Redang for late lunch but the taste is mediocre!!
5
Variety of Singapore taste: Chinese, Malay & Indian cuisine. Every single dishes is remarkably tasty.
4
Good local food buffet style. Ideal for tourists for range of food. Nice decor and ambience.
5
This is the best buffet breakfast I have ever had. Service is excellent.
5
Make sure you book for dinner as it is always busy. Food and atmosphere are outstanding. A must have experience
4
It was nice to catch up with friends and enjoy the plethora of food at Grand Hyatt's hotel. Buffet was 50pp plus drinks. No alcohol there bc it's halal! Service-wise they could have been better with drinks and also they screwed up my reservation, though they could accommodate.
3
the good thing about straits kitchen is that it is halal. so muslim families can feel free to bring their family for dinner.the spread is quite good. quite a wide variety to select from. there's chinese, malay, indian cuisine.i love the dessert section. you must try the yam paste.drinks are over priced.for the price that we're paying (ard 70sgd per pax) i'll definitely not go back to straits kitchen. i can get better hawker food and a more affordable price. :
4
We had dinner here with a few colleagues. The restaurant had been recommended to us for it's expansive and diverse buffet, which absolutely held true. There is a wide spread across all cuisines of Singapore, and my only recommendation would be to go hungry as there is quite a lot to sample and try. I would imagine that there are better individual restaurants in Singapore which specialize on one cuisine or another, but this is a really nice opportunity to go for all, especially with a group of people. Due to it's buffet style and the fact that there are also quite a few families with children it's not the most romantic place for dinner, but there are plenty other places in Singapore for that. The Grand Hyatt itself also has an impressive lobby which adds to the overall positive experience
5
From the day it opened in 2004, the Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt has been a hit..for both locals, hotel guests and visitors. Designed by Takashi Sugimoto from Super Potato, the fusion of simple, traditional and modern elements, plus the very clever lay-out are all a feast for your visual senses. You have a spread of Straits food ..the Straits being the waterway between Indonesia and the west coast of Malaysia - you have Malay, Indian and Chinese dishes, superbly displayed ..and you will not be disappointed by the flavours and range of tastes. Its a busy place, as it should be, rather than just a hotel restaurant - the Straits Kitchen reflects the vitality of South East Asia. Service is spotless by the way
3
I was very disapointed with the food quality and lack of authentic flavors. I only enjoy the indian food. For exemple, the beef rendang flavor wasn't there and we could only taste cumin and the desserts were way too sweet! However, the service is fantastic!
5
I loved the all you can breakfast. Fresh fruit, fresh raw salmon, and a espresso every morning. Overpriced but it was on my company card. Weekend buffet again was pricey but the quality was pretty good and you got to try indian, malay, and singaporean cuisine in one sitting.
4
I love taking people to Straits Kitchen - especially if it is their first time in Singapore. The variety of cuisines and beautiful decor make it noteworthy and memorable. My only suggestion is to add Thai to the restaurant's stalls. It is sort of strangely missing
5
I used to frequent this restaurant until lately, when i noted the food selection never change. However i must admit that the quality of food is great with a wide range of local food selections.The service is excellent.My only suggestion I have is that the restaurant clearly indicate to patrons that coffee does not come with the buffet. It is very irritation that whenever I ask for a coffee, which I know it it not free, the waiter will inform 'IT IS NOT PART OF THE BUFFET" I find this very irritating. If i can afford to pay for the buffet, I am sure to afford a cup of coffee. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE
4
Great restaurant, although quite a lot of fish and what I would term as exotic foods. I think the waiters were pretty fed up with me as I asked what everything was. Only gripe was when we asked the cost, it was given without tax, which then added another $14 SAUD onto the meal. Food good, as ans with most places in Singapore waiting staff excellent
5
With only 1 night for dinner in Singapore and an early flight out the next morning I was pleased to find so many recommendations for Straits Kitchen , particularly as it is located across the street from the Royal Plaza on Scotts where we were staying. I felt even more confident when, with a bit of googling I found a food blog -" the simplest aphrodisiac" -with photos of all the food (taken with the permission of the manager). I sent an email for a reservation which was quickly replied to. We visited several hawker centres and loved them especially the Maxwell Centre but you really can't beat this place for trying every specialty in one go. The price is quite amazing ($50 S for dinner) considering what you might pay in one of the popular chilli crab places. Loved everything - even had 2 helpings of black sticky rice after I was full! My best tips - wear your stretchy pants and don't drink too much alcohol (only because it is unbelievably expensive)
4
Nice buffet with a wonderful spread of local food such as chicken rice, laksa, rojak, poh piah, carrot cake, prata, tandorri chicken etc. Luv the dessert spread especially the fried banana which is really yummy. They have a good variety of juices to try as well.Certainly a nice comfortable place to sample local delights if you are not hitting the hawker centre
5
This was my second trip to the Straits Kitchen. It had been recommended by a local colleague (Westerner living in Malaysia/Singapore for 15 years) as a great sampling of local cuisine. After having traveled throughout Singapore/Malaysia/Indonesia for several months last year, I was looking forward to tasting some of the curries, Nonya food, etc. that I had enjoyed.i was not disappointed. While it is buffet format which may not be to everyone's liking, it is really the best way to have a chance to try the broad diversity of regional cuisine.The food quality was high, the presentation was nice, and it tasted great. Not a cheap eat-for that hit one of the many arcades/hawker stalls, but if you want an opportunity to try the local cuisine in a nice setting-this is the place
5
Had dinner with some friends on September 16th 2011.Indian section had wonderful variety of rotis and curries. The Masala prawns, Tandoori chicken, grilled lamb was delicious.Chinese section had the varieties of rice and noodlesMalay section had the usual mouthwatering rending etc.There's also the local section with chili crab and char kway teow.Dessert section had Chinese and Malay varieties together with the usual ice cream and ice kacang!Only at times the waiting staff are a bit eager to clear our plates.Overall the food and service is excellent
5
I went here on the last day of our visit to Singapore.After experiencing many food courts and diner during our visit, I can simply saythat this one is the best, and I am glad I could go there before leaving Singapore.The food choice is very good. Combining Chinese, Indian and Indonesian (Malay) cuisine, you can taste variety of culinary choices in one place.The food quality itself is very high!I cannot believe that I could I actually tasted the best laksa Singapore here. My other favorites include satay (chicken and beef), rendang, duck cookings, gado-gado, and ice kachang as a desert. Off course there are many other cookings, but my belly was swelling and I simply couldn't take anymore food.And what I like best is the environment. A five-star hotel designed dining place, fresh air, polite staffs, what more would you want.What seems to be dissapointing is perhaps the choice of beverages for buffet course, which is lacking basic drinks.What it cost? Well, it was Sing$ 44 pax + 10% service charge + gst.I was surprised with the service fee at first, but to get that kind of service quality? I gladly paid
4
The most best multi culture local favourites under one roof in Singapore !!!
The food is at its best, huge range, plus service is good.
4
Had dinner with couple of my friends @ SK, since we are chefs too, we found that for a buffet restaurant,the quality of the food was outstanding n two thumbs up for the Beef Rendang! It was absolutely great - Aaron

Sample all the best of local favourites under one roof. Best to entertain visitors.
A wonderful breakfast meeting place.
4
I found the selection of food good and as a tourist, having a good variety of Singapore food in one place that can be trusted as clean and of a comparable standard was extremely convenient. It is always good to eat in airconditioning too!
2
Horrible food for what should be a great place, good setting but food was not even comparable to a hawker centre for taste.
5
We enjoyed the Sunday lunch buffet very much with its broad selection of the multi-ethnic Singapore delights. In particular, we enjoyed the satay, the chili prawns and the mango pudding. All in all, a good experience. As it was Sunday, there were many local families there and that added to the experience: children are very much part of the ambiance of this culture. Four birthdays were celebrated while we were having an extended lunch
5
A huge buffet style restaurant, with multiple stations specializing in the various culture cuisines of Singapore. Excellent Indonesian, Chinese, Indian, desserts, fruits, and beverages are available at a great price. Take a big appetite and enjoy each of the separate cuisines, and the delicious desserts.Featured on one of the episodes of Anthony Bordain's travel program, Straits Kitchen is a must visit restaurant for any visit (or resident) to Singapore
1
The food is terrific, huge range, plus service is good although many somewhat over enthusiastic staff hovering as you near the end of the plate BUT it was the totally out of control children that sent me home early. I wasn't the only one complaining to management who were obviously oblivious to the screaming and yelling. Parents totally ineffective and seemed not to care - just kept eating! Management needs to reign in such outlandish behaviour whoever is doing it, and take care of the majority. It was quite a spectacle and yet management didn't even notice - a problem and i will not go back
2
Well, well, well, well, what have we hear? Another buffet servicing up meat at the incorrect temperature. There are no overhead heating lamps to maintain all the food at the right temperature. Stay clear of the chicken. It was lukewarm and made oneself sick. Also, the chiefs don't supervisor or ensure that hygine standards are met while guests serve themselves.If you must go, only eat from pot based dishes. Steer clear of dishes where meat is left to sit on top of other meat. Because there is only limited heat coming from the bottom of the pan and no radiant heat from above, food on top goes cold presenting a health risk.Service is very good, however it cannot make up for poor maintenance of the meat based dishes
4
Variety of local spread. Good service
5
Many and many Asian choices...
3
A good spread...but I just remember he roast duck was good.
3
I opt for this if I am in the mood for local hawker fare all under one roof with no cats roaming around!
5
If u have one night to savour the delicacies of Asia ... the rendang is absolutely fabulous!
3
Good but limited spread
4
great variety and up-to-mark quality
4
Yummy...
3
This halal certified food outlet is the perfect place to sample local hawker fare in classy environment and air-conditioned comfort.There is quite a good range of local food representative of what the Chinese, Malay and Indian eat on a daily basis. I found the Indian selection to be the best.Overall food quality is of acceptable standard but don't set your expectation too high
5
I was blown away by the variety and quality of Asian foods at this restaurant. I orignially decided to go because of Anthony Bourdain's recommendation but I know that if I am back in Singapore again, I will definitely make a point to go there for dinner. The different mini-kitchens represent the different people and culture influences in Singapore- Chinese, Indian, Malay etc. And at each of these stations is a speciality chef. There is also a fruit station where you can sample all of the crazy fruits that you don't usually see (in North America anyway). There is also a lovely dessert kitchen with a large diversity of treats. I tried of a lot of dishes as I made myself several sampler plates. Not everything was wonderful but I have to chalk some of that up to preference. The vast majority of foods that I tried were outstanding- particularly the Indian food. The service and presentation were great. It is $41 per person for all the food you can eat so some people might feel this is expensive especially when you can eat a good meal at a hawker center for $4. But this is a nice restaurant and you get many, many meals to try out from across Asia
5
Very good selection. My favourite is the oyster omelette.
2
Not satisfying with minimum food selection
3
The buffet offers a good variety of food
3
Gets a bit boring after awhile. But still a good pig out place.
2
not value for money.
3
Hawker food at restaurant prices
5
fantastic variaty and nice show cuisine ... superb as well for dessert and wine
4
pretty nice food.. but all local stuff.. suitable for tourist.. haha.. as for locals like me.. it might be pretty expensive to pay 50 per person for local delights...
3
Decent local food but expensive
2
Nice place with a pretty large range of local tasty food to savour - nice place to bring a foreignor... however the food cant even be compared to the tasty foods along the streets of Singapore or even chom chomp. Nice ambience but the food needs alot of improvements. The only food I like there was the Indian cusine
2
Expensive hawker fare!
3
it's halal
5
ohh...i'm luuurrrving it! From prata to laksa to nasi lemak & even rojak...u name it,they have it! Really feels like kopitiam!
5
Overpricey local fare in a nice ambience. Where else can u get to eat muah chee, roasted duck, buddha jump on the wall at one place that is halal?
3
First Choice for bringing overseas friends for a good selection of high class hawker fare in nice environment. Book in advance. Always full.
4
lots of local/asian fare in buffet.. desserts were quite pleasing..
ate till i was stuffed up,need i say more?
1
yucks!!! lets go newton or chomp or just AMK hawker center
4
Expensive buffet comprising of Singapore Hawker food.
5
It's one of the rare Halal buffet restaurant and one gets to eat the best of local cuisine.
3
great for out of town guests
