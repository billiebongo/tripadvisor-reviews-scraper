Service was excellent. Restaurant was well located and easy to identify. The food quality was great!

The Traffles risotto is a must try. Risotto is cook just nice and the truffles are extremely frangance.
5
Our best Italian meal in Singapore. Great food and lovely service. Robertson Quay is full of restaurants and so many are ‘average’ but this was excellent and we have no hesitation in recommending as well as returning. Thank you!

Bella Pasta in Robertson Quay is excellent. Had a fantastic pizza and beer, great afternoon with really friendly and speedy service. Buratta pizza was superb.
5
Staff were very friendly and food was good. Was suppose to be there for lunch ended up staying till 5.30 pm
5
One of our favorite places to eat is Bella's in Chico so on a whim tried Bella's in Singapore. It was excellent. Very fresh Italian food, well prepared and well served with a great outdoor table by the Quey
5
First time tried bellas pasta. The taste was good and i will come back again for sure. The ambience also nice and relax.
5
Must try Quatro cheese pizza and Ikasumi pasta, both of them are really really nice and worth to eat.
5
This was my third time to eat at this restaurant and it was the best. The pumpkin soup is excellent. They make a very good gluten free spaghetti which I had pomodoro and enjoyed it. My wife had the mushroom risotto and it was also excellent.

RISOTTO FUNGHI PORCINI TARTUFO NERO ($26++)Not my first time ordering this; it's still as good as I remember it. Juicy porcini mushrooms, tasty arborio rice & rich black truffle cream. I would think it's best to share this with some others so you don't get sick of how rich this is. But yes, just like the last time I had it, would still 100% recommend.PAPPARDELLE BOSCAIOLA ($26++)Not sure what pink sauce was supposed to mean; I was expecting a creamy tomato sauce, but the sauce felt just it had the same base as the Bolognese which we also ordered. Nonetheless, the homemade pappardelle was excellent (the sauce clung onto it so well), & they were kind enough to swap the usual bacon out for more italian sausage. Appreciated! But still wondering about the sauce.LINGUINE FRUTTI DI MARE ($26++)Not too oily, with just a hint of slight herbyness. The seafood-- calamari, clams, & shrimp-- were fresh & plentiful. Towards the end, my dad lamented, "wow the ratio of linguine to seafood... There's so much seafood"- I guess that's a happy problem?TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNESE ($24++)Mmm this was yummy. Not the best bolognese that I've had, & I am also not an expert. But I enjoyed this while it lasted.PIZZA BOSCAIOLA ($24++) Pretty decent pizza. Fresh from the neighbouring Bella Pizza oven. I like the crust being not too thick & doughy, yet not too thin & crispy like a cracker. It was crispy enough, like a dough should be (imho). & you can't go wrong with porcini mushrooms & Italian sausage on a pizza, really...ZUPPA DEL GIORNO ($10++)Soup of the Day was Carrot Soup. I didn't like it because it was so watered down & honestly just like blended, unflavoured carrots. Unfortunately, this wasn't ordered by me... But I did have a taste of it, & upon the first spoonful, this was my judgement.TIRAMISU ($10++)In my Chope reservation, I told Bella Pasta that it was my dad's birthday & asked if there was anything they could do to make our meal special. Having received no response to my query, I tossed it aside & treated this like a normal meal.Imagine how surprised I was (probably as much as my dad lol) when they brought out a slice of Tiramisu & started singing the birthday song! That was a really sweet gesture & I really appreciated it. We wolfed it down in an instant. Thank you Bella Pasta!

We used to really enjoy this place but the food on our last visit was terrible. Really deteriorated.
4
Working around the world, I always try to find a restaurant that makes me feel at home!!! The place itself is ok, but the pizza is really good!!! I had the pizza Burrata, and I have to say I was quite impressed!!!
4
Always one of my favorite Italian restaurant. Squid ink pasta is good,risotto is good and one of the best pizza in SG
4
After 2 days of Chinese / Asian food this was a great find on Robertson quay. Quick, friendly service and good quality pizza. Having been to Naples last year we're always comparing back to that and this was pretty good ! Kids loved it as well. Good half size pasta dishes for children if you ask for it - they're not on the menu. Definitely worth a visit.
4
Great ambiance, perfect for dates or gatherings with friends. Pasta was cooked perfectly, & flavours were amazing. Will definitely be back! One downside, though, is that they don't have happy hour promotions. But you're in Robertson Quay, so you could easily head elsewhere for a drink post-meal.Rigatoni Siciliana ($23++): Short pasta with eggplant, basil, parmesan & mozzarella cheese in a rich tomato sauce. They mean it when they say RICH. A simple yet hearty dish; the tomato sauce isn't too sour nor sweet-- just right.Risotto Funghi Porcini Tartufo Nero ($26++): Arborio rice with porcini mushrooms & black truffle cream. One of the most amazing risottos I've had to date. It wasn't sickeningly creamy, & there were lots of juicy mushrooms. I share my food (because I love variety haha) but I could imagine myself finishing this whole plate & not feel jelat.

Traveled recently with Family Member who need Gluten Free meals.Very difficult to find in Singapore Restaurant but think they are becoming more aware. Bella Pasta (very close to where we were staying) offered Gluten Free Option. 4 Adults/1 Child ate here and everyone not only enjoyed their various meals but also the friendly and jovial waiters. Would certainly recommend
2
Never coming back! I took a chance to bring my foreign friend to Bella Pasta because my choice Italian restaurant nearby in Robertson Quay was closed for the day. I regretted that decision. Immediately on the onset, the waiter was an extremely annoying sort of pushy. Furthermore, the place was small and not filled but he was hardly omnipresent, only conveniently appearing when he wanted to push a sale. He gave a face when my friend needed more time to think about ordering the Happy Hour beer promotion. When I was ready to order my wine, he whizzed past our table, ignoring our eyes or waved hands - THREE times. My friend joked that he was really a character. In the end, we managed to get our drinks ordered through another waiter. When my friend's beer was served, he had the audacity to spill the beer along the way and yet serve it to my friend! Next, he pushed the promotional dishes for the day. We gave in and ordered the buffala (buffalo cheese), just because he sold it as something really good. Just for context, I've eaten my fair share of buffala from various Italian restaurants and even in Italy but the buffala I had here was horrendous! It was served looking appetizing but when I cut into the cheese, the buffala collapsed, oozing watery cheese from within. It was NOT fresh. I wonder now why they were pushing it as a promotional item. To clear stock? I can only wonder. The biggest joke? The cheese was served without olive oil or vinegar. I had to request for it. The second biggest joke? The eventual olive oil and vinegar were served in plastic melamine dishes - the sort where I can find these dishes in local hawker centers. The place is pretentiously looking like a classy Italian restaurant but sadly, isn't. We ordered our mains - pasta. After all, the restaurant has "pasta" in the name. One would think that they'd specialise in cooking pasta. Rubbish. My Fruitti de Mare Aglio Olio was served with un-fresh prawns and clams. The clams were soggy and sandy. My friend didn't even finish his pasta serving. I won't come back again and I'll advise others to think twice too.
4
I've been at Bella Pasta multiple times and the food never fail to impress me. Service wise was a bit hit and miss. Initially, we have quite a bit of difficulty drawing the attention of wait staff and the coke we ordered never arrived till we asked again. At the end, there was a fantastic staff who managed to really make us feel at home with his friendly demeanour. Will definitely be back again
5
Situated right in Robertson Quay, the place offers you a romantic setting. Sadly, I'm not romantic, and I'm only there for the food. Last time, I came I was at the sister outlet - Bella Pizza outlet, eating pasta. Since Bella Pizza was closed, I decided to give Bella Pasta a try. Ironically, we ended up having the classic Bella pizza instead at Bella Pasta, as the pasta choices were to exotic for my taste. We also ordered the CARPACCIO DI CARNE. As fancy as the name sounds, it's actually just rockets, tomatoes, and thinly sliced beef. And we love it
4
Much better than the tourist traps of Clarke Quay. Here you get a decent meal and good service, a nice view and you can have a nice chat with your company. We had a salad and spaghetti with mussels. Both tasted excellent. Great place for lunch
1
Food was not available, especially the burata. I expected more from the restaurant especially since this was one of their main dishes.
5
Good place to have some italian food. We ordered Bolognese pasta and proshiuto pasta. Delicious! Nice ambience
4
Not too noisy, not too clouded, having good breeze at the riverside.
We had a business dinner with partners, and I would call this a safe place for such business dinner.
I appreciate their decent service.
Not very romantic, I guess.
4
Group of 5 aussies out for a pasta meal, chose Bella Pasta and we were not disappointed. We loved the service the alfresco dining and the food was great. Wine was expensive, but it is everywhere in Singapore. Would recommend highly.
4
Great Italian restaurant. Very tastful typical Italian dishes of good quality and fair prices. Very serviceminded staff. Was there three times in my Singapore week. All very satisfactory
1
Sounded good, succulent slow cooked pork belly with crispy crackling. Must have been describing something else because what we got was tough pork belly, no slow cooking there and rubbery rind - no crisping even attempted. The meal did not include even a sauce and very little to accompany it, a few small potatoes. And they were charging quite a high price as well. Be warned, there are heaps of better places Even the supermarket serves better cooked pork belly and it is only $7.95 for a huge piece
5
Friendly and helpful staff, serving exquisite Italian food and wine by the Quayside in Singapore, we enjoyed our lunch so much we went back for dinner, not just amazing food, but a gorgeous bottle of Pinot Grigio to complement it, this is another restaurant Im looking forward to revisiting
5
It was the last night of our holiday and Bella Pasta was close to our hotel, so we decided to eat there. The food was absolutely georgeous, the atmosphere was lovely right by the river and a bit more peaceful than the nearby Clarke Quay, and the staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for them and it was nice to have a conversation and a bit of a laugh with them. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Will be returning when we are next in Singapore. Thank you for making the last evening of our holiday a memorable one
2
We tried 3 different dishes , namely Melanzane , Ravioli di Ricotta, Pizza with Salmon . None of them was really what could be expected from Italian food ( Pizza particularly )..Wine in carafe was not good. I selected this place due to the former comments : may be from people who never had a chance to have real Italian food ! Or may be the cook changed
4
Family of four visited this restaurant to celebrate daughter's birthday. Server went all out to make our dining experience fun and delightful. We ordered the meat platter, the beef stew and a pizza. All are delicious. Server's friendliness really adds to the whole dining experience. Will definitely go back again.
5
How lovely to sit by the river on a February night . As the owner said " like Venice "
Really good food and service with a smile .
4
Had dinner at this cosy Italian restaurant. Ordered the PROSCIUTTO E MELONE, SPAGHETTI ALLE VONGOLE and Parma Ham Pizza. Simply delicious. You could dine in the restaurant or Al Fresco. Either way, it had a nice atmosphere.
1
Poor service mediocre food and wow expensive for what you get. Many better than this in the area and I believe location is the best part.
5
Amazing food and even more amazing service! The owner adds to my experience. She has such an amazing smile and so down to earth!
5
My mother, daughter and I had dinner at this restaurant last night and extremely rate this restaurant. The staff were very attentive with the food absolutely delicious. My whole family had various pasta dishes with no complaints. Highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Went there to celebrate my birthday with my gfs, love the quality and flavorful pasta. Will always be back for more!
4
After being on holiday for nearly 4 weeks it was great to have some really well-cooked food that felt a little bit more like home (Australia). The pizza and pasta were very, very good and they were able to cater for our 3 year old by offering a 'small main' which was something that was unexpected but made the experience all the more worthwhile.
3
Sunny Sunday afternoon. Took a stroll from new digs at Urbana, 8 minutes to Robertson Quay. I had had lunch kast week with colleagues. Pretty ok. Now with wife. We sat indoors. Waiter came quickly, sparkling water. Menu - good display of Italian dishes and pizzas. Not cheap. We ordered Insalata Mista, and some olives. Then Spagetti Vingole and Pizza Diavola. Warm bread came and olive oil/balsamico. Then wait circa 10-15 min. Then came Vongole and pizza. After ask came salad with slices of cheese on to and some green and black olives (without pips) strewn on top. Out of sync. I presume the waiter knew of normal staging of Italian meals. So I'm not sure why this happened. Arrogance?Anyway I would come back for food, a pretty safe bet it seemed. But service need to be less arrogant and obviously more in sync.
5
we called in for lunch for a pizza and a drink, service very good pizza very good and the view - brilliant what could be better than eating and having a drink on the waterfront as life passes by on a wonderful sunny 36 degree day in January when you know it is cold back home
5
At Bella Pasta you get value for money. The service is excellent. The wine is very good. We shared a pizza - no problem sir. The cranberry juice was full strength. I drank a lovely New Zealand pinot Gris with the pizza. The pizza was top notch.
5
Very authentic Italian food. Margherita pizza for entree. All pastas for main were like Nona's pasta. Generous serves. Service was very friendly, efficient and polite.
4
Really enjoyed this restaurant - good service, wine and food. The pasta delicious -as good as my favourite Italian restaurant in Australia. The best meal I have had in Singapore!
2
Tried really hard to like this place but insipid soup, salad without dressing, watery pasta .. All didn't really make for a great meal. The service is good though.
4
Stopped for a quick meal and had spaghetti aglio olio and bruscetta. The spaghetti was laden with garlic which was worrying but they had been blanched and were very mild. In all one of the best simple dishes I had.
5
we had two meals at this restaurant during our stay last week in Singapore. Italian food as it should be. Waiter excellent a special mention to Martino who served us on one visit. .Recommend for good italian food....
4
I am giving it four stars because of the food and the drinks we've had.The service was so so and not attentive at allIt took forever to get the order, the waiter was rushing us and then they brought the wrong food mediocre service , but the food was to die for, so I will take bad service for excellent food and not vice versa. Ideally Yiu would get both , but nobody's perfect Everything was fresh and cooked to order, not reheated food from earlier in the day We tried the seafood pizza and several pasta dishes and the the steak, the pizza was excellent and all the pasta Like the baked eggplant dish for appetiser and the calamari One of the best midrange Italians around Robertson and Clark Quays
5
Our host took us here and we had an excellent time. A great range of lovely traditional Italian and pastas. The pastas were homemade and al dente and we loved the pizza too. It is also located in a really nice spot by the riverfront. Service was friendly. Definitely recommend if you are looking for good Italian food 
4
Bella Pasta and Bella Pizza are favourites of the family. The quality is great and whilst not as cheap as the food courts can be a great place to visit for lunch or dinner. Mains are around $S25, but drinks are expensive as with other places in Singapor
4
Last year we were taken to Bella Pizza by my niece, we like it very much but the servings were too small, this year my partner and I went to Bella Pasta as it seems only 1 is open at a time, they are a few doors away from each other.We sat outside as you get a view of the river and the weather is always good at night if not raining.We got seated quickly, the service was alright but as it got busier we waited longer for our order to be taken, and then served.The food was very nice, I learned from last year not to have the pasta as I had too smaller serve, so I went a pizza and the serving size was perfect for me.The main problem with Bella Pasta that Bella Pizza didn't have is the road being right near the tables, they may find putting bigger trees in the pots near the road may stop the glare from the traffic as your trying to eat, also there were delivery trucks running while they delivered their goods, making it hard to have a conversation.But we will more than likely be going back on our next visit
5
Bella Pasta along with its sister Bella Pizza is one of the best Pizza in town. The service is way above Singapore standards and the setting by the river is really nice, especially since the area has been nicely revamped (bigger terrace, trees and grass and better view of the river
4
The pizza was Italian-class. I can't speak for anything else. The location is nice, too, as you can people-watch along the riverfront. Highly recommend if you have those in your group that don't do adventurous eating!
4
Located at the pretty Robertson Quay, Bella Pasta is situated right beside the river where there is indoor and alfresco seating. Sitting outside, you can watch people walk by around you.Food was good, we had salmon and another cheesy pasta (i don't remember the names) and there were tasty and well filling. The wine selection is not bad as well and tasted good. Pastas cost $20/30 ++Service wise, the staff were friendly and helpful. There was a major issue though. There were only 3 front of house service staff during dinner time. This was clearly insufficient given the size of the restaurant. I saw with my own eyes during my dinner there, 2 customers at different tables leave because they had waited for some time and noone came to serve them. This was definitely not the fault of the service staff as I could see them rushing around trying to meet customers' requests. The management needs to get more manpower as current numbers are definitely insufficient.Overall experience was pleasant and good for us, it was largely positive bar the sight of 2 customers leaving due to lack of service
4
We had a meal at this restaurant as it was adjacent to our hotel and were pleasantly surprised. My wife had roast chicken, one of her staples, which she assured me was very good and it was a decent portion. I had shrimp ravioli, which I had never had before. This was very tasty and very filling. It was good to get proper chips, as opposed to "fries" and again decent portions.The staff wee very good and friendly; they ensured that the iced water was constantly topped up - a blessing in the heat and humidity. Very good value at £45 per head, including drinks.I would eat here again if I were lucky enough to return to Singapore
2
Not very accommodating to gluten free eaters, menu is Pasta Pasta Pasta. Had take away from them before and was very 'heavy' feeling.
2
Great location sitting outside catching the river breeze and people watching, however both our salad meals were simply heaped plates of mostly spinach with tiny amounts of toppings and a little dressing splashed over which quickly became just a pile of plain bare greens to munch!Unappetizing and disappointing..
2
For an Italian dining experience, this restaurant is a let-down. Coming from the US, we were used to a lively, hospitable ambience with attendants chirping and engaging in small banter. Found none of this at Bella Pasta.Not that they had a shortage of staff. Our table was ignored and we were a sizeable party of 8. Water glass not refilled, Table not setup properly, bread servings not in proportion to table size. Even the final bill arrived only after I asked for it. Extremely disappointed. Location wise, they're right by the river with enough place for kids to run-around, which is why we chose them. They're not going to see me walk their way, despite living 2 blocks from Robertson quay
4
We had a beautiful meal here while visiting Singapore in September 2015. The calzone was huge and I mean huge, half the size of the main plate. The ravioli was very tasty , but for the price of it , more like an entrée size than a main. It was quite expensive$24.00 for the amount that was dished up compared to the calzone. There was no parmesan cheese offered with the pasta and then ontop of price on menu you need to remember GST and service tax. Even though the pasta was amazing and fresh more was needed., pasta is cheap, unfortunately I left still hungry, even after bread. But would visit again but would maybe enjoy a pizza , more fillin
5
We stumbled upon this cozy spot not too far from our hotel and it turned out to be a great choice! Wide menu offering with something for everyone. Server suggested table sharing which worked out nicely. We had an antipasto platter and calamari to start. The burrata was amazing, fresh and creamy. Great spinach salad. We were after some comfort pastas and all our choices hit the spot. The frutti de mare pasta had a nice tangy sauce and seafood was fresh but what was really outstanding was the porcini truffle risotto. Nice wine list with surprisingly good house pours. Service was good with staff being attentive without being in your face. Location fantastic especially if you like to chill alfresco like me
5
Upon first entrance to Bella Pasta, I was definitely enthralled by the beautiful, modern decor that welcomed me. We sat on the very nice outdoor patio, which had a very nice view and feel in the warm air. The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly, which added to the great experience immediately as we walked into the resto.As great as the atmosphere is, the food is really what stole the show. We started sharing the calamari and the carpaccio salad. The calamari were perfectly battered and very lightly fried, while the caparaccio was so nicely sliced and the garnish of arugula and cherry tomatoes accented the dish perfectly.For the main, I had the snapper fillet while my friend took the risotto with mushrooms and truffle oil. The snapper was excellent, grilled and seasoned to perfection! I really enjoyed it and I would even say that it was one of the best snappers I have ever had.The drinks should also be mentioned as a strong point! I had a Limoncello Mojito and my friend had something called an Italian Breeze! Definitely delicious and a nice way to start the evening with some great alcohol! Overall, we both agreed that Bella Pasta was a top class meal and restaurant with it's visual beauty and friendly owners
4
Went there for a casual weeknight dinner. I really liked the Linguine with seafood, tasty with generous portions of shrimp, clams and calamari. My husband had the grilled spring chicken, which was flavourful with crispy roast potatoes. We had the house red ( cab sav) and house white (pino grigio), both great drinking wines. The waitstaff were polite and friendly and kept refilling our water glasses
3
Visited on Saturday night after 7:30 and the place was packed but there were still a few tables outside (which was great since we had our dog with us). We shared the spinach & feta salad (really good - could have benefited from fresh cracked pepper though - no salt & pepper to be found), the rack of lamb (cooked med rare as ordered) and fresh snapper. The mains were tasty however some of the food was actually cold. Unfortunately our server never came back to ask us how our meal was so I could not report the problem (only 2 guys serving and bussing 15 tables)
3
Although I only ate a pizza and therefore have a limited judgment on the food, what I eat was average and nothing really special. It was OK pizza, but that's about it.Odd thing was that the place felt like it was dead. I was sitting outside, as the only one. People came, looked and the menu and left. It has a great outside seating area, but it needs more work to make it a good Italian atmosphere. Adds with happy hour don't work either.it looks like this restaurant is in competition with the other Italian restaurant across the street. I am afraid they are going to win the game as they know how to create a cozy atmosphere
3
We stopped by this place one afternoon for some pasta and some drinks:Setting: Nice setting in Robertson Quay, close to the water, comfortable chairsFood: We had some regular pasta dishes, nothing to fancy, average preparation, presentation and taste, ingredients were fresh enough, nothing too thrillingDrinks:Normal selection of drinks, wine list adequate, but not to interestingVerdict:OK for a quick bite while passing throughI would not recommend the place for a more elaborate dinnerThere are many better places around that are
5
I had a fantastic experience here and was really impressed by the food.They serve simple, non complicated, authentic Italian dishes without much modifications and adjustment and what makes it good is that the dishes were mostly flavourful and tasty!I was super impressed by their Ragatoni Alla Siciliana and all of the side dishes I ordered were completed delightfully.They also serve one of the better tiramisus around!Pizzas can also be ordered from their sister restaurant, Bella Pizza right next door.Read my blog for full reviews:http://ilovedawn00.blogspot.sg/2015/04/food-review-bella-pasta.htm

Had a dinner on Wednesday and it was an amazing as usual...this restaurant been our favorite place to dine in when ever we are in Singapore... Last June when I was here it wasn't pleasant dinner...food was terrible really really bad service it was...since we love this restaurant this time we tried again.surprisingly it was up to the standard.....and I noticed that chef has back...the guy who cook Italian food better than some Italian in Singapore....spaghetti vongole...ever since they maintain the quality of that pasta and seafood pasta equally good...and saw new Italian manager who knows abt his wine list A to Z....and recommended us very good wine...really a worthy place to dine in...hope to visit again on my next trip.
3
We visited on a busy eve when it just started to rain so people were dashing for indoor tables. Made welcome but service very slow and not brilliant food . Offered free dessert for time delay on main which was very nice and acceptable. Then beware once you get bill there is 10% service charge and local tax 15% so makes it expensive not only in this restaurant but others in Robertson Quay
4
It seems a bit incongruous to go to Singapore and eat pasta, but this pasta was very good. I had gnocchi with four cheeses, which was superb, and my husband had cannelloni, which he rated as OK. Wine is very expensive, we had a bottle of the cheapest pinot grigio, which cost AUD$58. However, we did receive a complimentary limoncello with our coffee. Service was very good
3
As Italian maybe I'm quite picky about how to make a pizza...but indeed this I'd not the way :( the tomato sauce didn't taste at all and mozzarella neither...the dough didn't have any salt.Service was good, location great, lots of ppl we're ordering pasta and seem to be quite happy with that so maybe is good for pasta....I might give if another try with pasta if I'm in that area and I'm craving for pasta because of the location SMD atmosphere..
5
I am a regular at this restaurant. The staff and manager know my name and service is first class. The thing that keeps me going is the excellent food. The pizzas are one the best. Being from Europe I think this place makes the best bolognese tagliatelle. Today I finally tried their beef tenderloin. Very good presentation and these days a steak for this price is rare in Singapore. I also gave the chocolate cake a try for the first time and it was good really hit the spot.This is one of those places you can go frequently. Highly recommend this place. Out door sitting during the sun set with a glass of Montepulciano
1
We just finished a dinner at this restaurant. The place is terribly under-served, such that it took us nearly 40mins to be served. The food was poor, the staff harassed and unhappy and when a friend spoke to the manager/owner his reply to the comment about service was "well, I'm rich anyway". Never go here
2
Ordered the quattro formaggi gnocchi and king prawns and scallops linguine. Arrived luke warm and the gnocchi was not melt in your mouth as it should be, but rather doughy and simple furthermore the 4 cheese sauce tasted like something out of a "mix with water" powder packet. The linguine had 2 king prawns and 1 scallop for an eye watering $33 SGD.Absolutely not worth the over the top price (even for SG) and although a nice location (Robertson Quay), overall not an experience I'd recommend or do again
5
I chanced upon this hidden gem and I was wondering whether to give it a try. Boy was I glad that I did!!! The manager Antonio was so friendly that he was happy to guide you on what to try and whether it was too much. The seafood pasta was superb! The tiramisu was heavenly! The service was great! Oh by the way after all the pigging out session we were recommended by Antonio to have limoncello to help digest our meals. It worked but beware do not be deceive by the sweet smelling, good looking in the petite glass! This drink packs a punch like Tyson. Above all that do not forget to try the sorbet too! Bon appetit!
4
We have visited this restaurant a number of times since it opened a couple of years ago. It is the sister to Bella Pizza near by. As usual we were welcomed by Antonio the proprietor, and seated.We chose a selection of pastas and decided to share. The food was very good, one of our party having the 'fish of the day' cooked to order. The location is lovely by the river, and we all enjoyed our evening there. We will return!!
5
I have been to Bella Pasta twice and cannot recommend it highly enough.A great restaurant in Robertson Quay, it is nice and central with a great riverside location. Beyond it's prime location the food, service and value for money is all exceptional too.With indoor and outdoor seating, I have never been to Bella Pasta and not seen if full. Even with a (seemingly constant) full house, the staff are always welcoming, friendly and get the great balance of being attentive but not bothering you every 5 minutes. All the staff I have encountered have been knowledgable about the menu and able to assist with any queries you have. The food here is authentically Italian and absolutely delicious, I can remember every bite I have eaten there. Pizza and Pasta are both absolutely great. Portion sizes are as you would expect, just right.I am really impressed that for what the team at Bella Pasta deliver, the prices aren't extortionate but just right and something I will happily pay time and time again.See you there soon
4
Nice place right next to Clarke Quay.Good variety of pastas but a bit over-priced.Must try - Cannelloni Alla NapoletanaYou can also try "Wine Connection" next to this restaurant. For cheaper pastas, I'd prefer "Kebab Station" at Changi Business Park [Fav - Chicken baked pasta]
4
Staff are all very good. The atmosphere is stylisjh and the reataurant well laid out. Food:Bruschetta - skip it, bread not very goodCaprese - delish, tho mozzarella a bit on the salty side - did have a good sweet side as wellAglio olio was delicious - bit too salty but plenty of garlic! and basilI enjoyed the spinach and ricotta raviolli very muchWe sat outside and had a nice meal, though the background music could have been lower - or how about some classic jazz
2
Went with two friends for dinner on new years day. Totally underwhelmed on various counts. A few of the pasta dishes and a fish main were not available ...on new years day ! When I asked the wait staff if a lasagne was available because I didn't find it on the menu she wasn't sure. I then asked for an aglio olio with prawn but the prawns to be shelled I was told that was not possible. I then settled for a spaghetti bolognaise. The portion I was served didn't look anything like a main course in quantity.. At 24 bucks a main course it looked woefully small! The spaghetti itself was overcooked slightly. I asked the wait staff for paprika and was told they didn't have any. I told her to ask the chef and she came back and said chef confirms no paprika ! The whole experience was underwhelming given the overall quality and definitely not value for money
4
As a place for a quick meal, this is a good place to visit. It is a bit noisy at times. My pasta was good, as we're the pizzas served to my friends. Nice to be along the river away from the tourist crowds of Clarke Quay
3
Decided to try this after trying the Bella Pizza a few doors down. Although we thought we made it clear that we wanted to split a salad, the server showed up with 2 large salads. Since it looked good, we decided to just keep it. Lots of grape tomatoes and shavings of parmesan, topped with a nice balsamic vinegar. For the main course, I ordered the cannelloni alla napoletana and my husband ordered the pappardelle alla boscaiola. I would surmise to say mine was almost like lasagna, but unfortunately only had a few cannelloni and tons of sauce. I actually couldn't even eat it for the first 5 or so minutes because it was SO hot! I think my husband was halfway through with his before I could take a bite, even blowing on it, couldn't stop the roof of my mouth burning! The sauce was very flavorful but I spent eating 3/4 of it with bread to soak up all the sauce remaining. Just not enough noodles. My husband's dish also was drowning in sauce. He made a comment about the sausage having a "funny" taste that he couldn't quite place, and ended up picking those pieces out. Needless to say, not soon after we left, his stomach wasn't feeling quite right. With so many other places to try, probably won't be heading back there any time soon. Pity since we live in walking distance and love pasta

I've eaten at this Italian twice and both times it was mediocre food, mediocre service and the usual eye watering Singapore price. I don't mind paying the going rate if the experience is worth it but the fact is there are much better options on this street

A great pizza if you'r looking for one. Go to the bigger branch, which is just around the corner from the little one. Just ask.

Pasta was tasty, the service was great, the setting was nice, on the riverfront at Robertson Quay.
Would definitely eat here again.

Food was delicious. Service was great, although it was rather empty so they didn't have much else to do. Complimentary drink at the end. Can't complain.

This restaurant is easy to miss along the river but it's worth a stop. Prices are very affordable as opposed to some other restaurants in this touristy area. Service is good. Food is simple & basic but tasty. There is a sister restaurant called 'Bella Pizza' (just around the corner) which specializes in pizza as the name suggests but you can order from both menus. There is a nice outside dining area

Bella pasta, a warm italian-style corner in frantic singapore. The right place to enjoy your original italian taste at its right pace. Slow down from a running day, seat and relax. No hurry! As in the traditional italian family.I had my favorite linguini al gambero, juicy and good... Of course i had to wait because all dishes are prepared expressed, a la minute, but the wait is worth the prize! I went then with an orata alle erbe, grilled snapper, fabulous! And of course i could not miss my tirami su, here one of the best i ever experienced in asia. I ended with my espresso as the perfect end of a perfect meal.Even though the place was quite crowded, the service was good and helpful. I had to wait more than 20 min to get my food, but it was ok and actually made me feel like home. I was enjoying my time with my friends anyway.In the end it took us more than one hour to finish dinner, but we left fully satisfied!I suggest bella pasta to all of you that want to experience italy in its original flavor and slowness, as it should be for a food that means not only energy for the body but a moment to slow down and share quality time with the people you care and love. Thanks to antonio and all the wonderful staff to let me experience it.Gabriel

Don't understand the other comments. We ate there on two separate nights during a single week stay at Riverside Village next door and both times was very good food, service a little slow but not unacceptably so. The second visit was at the insistence of our sons - one loved the soups of the day, the other the penne with bolognaise sauce. I had belly pork one night from the grill, the other night large prawn and calamari, also off the grill. Both were great (I am not a pasta fan but the rest of the family are!). My wife also very happy with both her meals chosen. My only complaint - I fancied a dessert on the second visit but they were out of sorbetto which I had set my heart on

Well, I'm not normally the kind of guy that feels the need to write on a website a out how awful a restaurant is because I didn't like the peanuts but this place had some of the worsted management I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Let me explain;My wife and I arrived at about 9pm and there were plenty of people eating and waiting. We ordered a glass of wine each and one pizza and a pasta dish. After we had finished the first glass and ordered a second (30 mins) we asked the manager what the delay was. He said that the problem was that the pizzas were made in a different part of the kitchen and he had no way of knowing how long they would take (???? What????). We asked if it was possible for us to have a free drink as a apology for the delay to which he. Said that even thou he was the manager, he wasn't the "real" manager and so could do nothing!He then went inside and shouted at the kitchen staff to hurry up.By the time we received our meal, we noticed that some people who had been seated after us had received their starter and were already on their main course (some of which were pizza) before we received ours.After the meal I asked the waitress to get the manager again as I wanted to point this out to him. I watched her go inside, talk to him, and then come out and say that he wasn't available whilst he stood inside. I went inside to confront him to say that this was unacceptable and that as the manager of a restaurant he needed to take responsibility for the operationas of his restaurant. I said that not knowing how long the kitchen would take to cook a pizza wasn't acceptable. I said that getting a junior member of staff to tell you that the manger was unavailable whilst hiding inside was unacceptable. He continued to claim that he had explained the reason for the delay and that I was being unreasonable that is why he wouldn't talk to me. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!The thing that irritates me the most is the fact that the food really wasn't that bad at all!

Bella Pasta, a total DISASTA! Was at Robertson Quay after a show and decided to try out Bella Pasta for dinner. What a tragic mistake!!! It was easily the WORST MEAL we've ever had in the last decade! The calamaris were bland and rubbery. We asked for a mixed green salad and chef could only give us (literally) a pile of baby spinach with nothing else on it. He didn't even bother to add a few bits of chopped tomatoes for colour! The leaves were rather tough and brittle - fit for cows only, and some still had a white-powdery coating on them (presumably from chemical pesticide spray). Rather than remove and cancel the dish, waiter told us that the best the chef could do was to charge us half price for the inedible cow fodder. Of the 4 pasta dishes we ordered, two of them (mushroom and seafood) tasted barely average, and the other two - Linguini with King Prawns and Scallop ($33) - tasted extremely bland. No salt, hardly any herbs, the prawns were tough and overcooked and the one little forlorn scallop on the plate looked completely dehydrated and stringy. We left with much of our food untouched. It was truly a disastrous experience (which in Singapore these days is quite an achievement what with so much stiff competition), and prices were marked as high as the best Italian restaurants in town (eg. Otto)! We left feeling hungry, angry and cheated. Definitely will not go back nor recommend

I agree with the other reviews that describe the food as being average. Everything was tasty but nothing was memorable. I would not eat here if I was looking for great Italian food, but would definitely go if I was looking for good value. The set lunch included three courses and coffee for SGD 15. The setting was very nice and the food came out quickly

This is quite a typical example of Italian restaurant outside Italy: food is quite ok (even if selection is not so wide) but nothing special. As an Italian, I wouldn't recommend it to somebody looking to have a taste of real Italian food but it's ok to have a quick pasta without too expectations. The location is nice, and service is quite fast and good
