Tried this stall a number of times. The taste is consistent. The service may not be good but this is a hawker stall not some high class restaurant. Worth a try.

no idea why the hype, maybe it's just my subjective opinion, it's nothing spectacular. and for a couple times I visited the stall, there's no Q, and I have no idea why they needed an electric Q system... some of my friends like it though...

It's one of my preferred Wan Tan noodles. Always busy, managed by Father & Daughter team on the weekends. Just ignore the unfriendliness of the owner/dad running the business. You are here to have a good Wan Tan noodles.Noodles are beautifully cooked, drained n texture the way I like it. The Chilli sauce rocks, even the Wan Tan tastes good.Expect Q to be Long but it's worth the wait. I try to visit this once a week despite having to drive quite a distance.Yummy ....

It's a reliable alternative if you want to just have a meal, away from the long queues at other stalls in the food center. The meal gives you what you'd expect of wonton noodles. For the dry version, the noodles are well sauced and that seemed to keep the noodles tasty right to last strand. If you didn't indicate the size/price when ordering, you'll get the default $4 serving.

There is no queue and no fuss outside the stall but the wonton soup it offers reminds me of the taste of Shanghai during my childhood. The broth is light but the minced pork filling is appropriately flavored and wrapped under thin skins. The best wonton soup I have had in Singapore thus far

One of the worse service I ever had from a hawker stall...not even a decent smile and felt as if I owed it to them that I am patronising their stall. As a local I am embarrassed by the attitude of the lady at the stall, let alone recommend it to friends from afar.Sadly the wanton noodle was nothing to fave about.Perhaps it was in the past and I may have 'missed the boat' when it was the talk of the town.If you are at old airport road food hawker, there are other similar stalls to take your fancy...but I wouldn't attempt this stall for a second time
