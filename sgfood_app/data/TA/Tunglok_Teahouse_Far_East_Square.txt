Prompt service despite the rush lunch hour. Quality Dim Sum.
Friendly staff. As it was nearing CNY, we ordered Lo-Hei as well. Salmon sashimi serving was generous.

Had a pre CNY dinner at tunglok tea house. Currently serving the Chinese New Year buffet menu. Good selection was good. Lou hei was included in the menu. Parents enjoyed the dinner. Service was good and swift.

Service staff is very friendly, food is average only, nothing to rave about. I only had the dim sum food.
3
Food is ok but there should have room for improvement. After they renamed Zhou's Kitchen to Tung Lok, taste was good but now standard declining. Overall taste is ok.
5
Good service by attentive staff. Nice and comfy environment, good place for family gathering especially during weekends.
4
Dim sum variety was limited albeit the taste was passable. Certain dishes were hits and misses for the price we paid.
5
Food were great! The mee sua was nicely done & fishmaw soup was very deep favor!! The dim sum selection was good too!
4
Buffet is not bad and will , will arrange the portion according to how many person you have,service is good.

Visited this place with my hubby and tried their set meal & a side. Some dishes were really good and worth going back again for, but some others were not worth trying.Dishes to tryTheir salted egg fish skin & salted egg prawns, tofu and veggie dish were very good.Food to skip: Soup of the day and the braised meat and rice were in my opinion average. The fried fish fillet fried with too much batter, hard and tasteless. Service was acceptable but unlike some of the other Tunglok group dining establishments

I think the dimsum is generally quite good although it still has some way to go in comparison to the likes of Lei Garden. It's more than enough for an enjoyable experience and I particularly enjoyed the attention paid to the interior decor, which made the visit worthwhile.
5
Family lunch, dim sum we fantastic. The chili crab also of very good quality and value. Definitely recommended
5
My friends and I truly enjoyed our lunch at at Tunglok Teahouse @ Far East Square. The service was prompt and good. We were spoiled from the choices on the variety of dishes.
3
Average food with average service. But worth the money especially in CBD area hence the crowd. Worth going though.
3
Service was normal, the food was nothing fantastic. The place was not packed. We went there for birthday celebration and we spent about 500 bucks for 9 pax
3
Food needs to be improved. Service is ok. Person manning the phone is Sam who is very courteous over the phone.
5
Excellent service and food they gave us. They served every dish we ordered so fast. All these dishes are good except mapo tofu beancurd.
5
I love everything here except for the table placed near the cashier counter. Though I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seated there, I just felt inconvenienced if I am seated there. Overall, a pleasant dining experience with yummy dim sum, polite service and prompt serving of food. I like that they will call to follow up on the chope reservations made.
5
It feels good like how I used to live in Guangzhou that you can have dim sum from 3am until 12am; Tunglok Teahouse gave me the same feeling that I have got before. I will say decent dim sum serving with local warm service that you will experience here
4
Unlike other alacarte buffet, this served in small portion which is good as we can try out more dishes. Although the chilli crab is limit to one serving per table, but it doesn't taste that fantastic. The dumpling in the chicken soup also has a weird "porky" taste. Tea are refilled many times till it became bland and they still serve you that. Guess they charge per pot so won't change. Service good.
4
Went there for lunch and ordered their signature rolls, BBQ pork bun, truffle dumplings and seafood vermicelli. For dessert, we ordered egg tarts. The food has always been very good and the above orders are a must for us each time we visit! This is by far he best place for dimsum and even our visitors from overseas are impressed with the food! However it would be better if they serve sweet orders later as they would have turned cold after we are done with our savouries. Hope they will take this in mind in our next visit.
4
Lots of food variety but not all quality same. Some are too salty. Price wise is not cheap if don't have vouchers
3
Went for the alacart buffet. Menu looks good but food is not nice. Service staffs are nice, they even help us decorate the cake on a nice plate with beautiful setting.
5
Very nice! The restaurant is clean and Chinese Style, very unique. The food is tasty! very worth to try!
3
Went for dim sum lunch. They have the standard items but also have some interesting unusual items. Ok overall. A bit pricey though for teahouse setting.
5
Super value for money for the large assortment of dishes available for our buffet lunch! Food was super yummy, accompanied by prompt efficient service by the staff! Thumbs up üëçüèª
3
4 out of 10 dishes not really nice. Too salty. Will not return in near future. Price not value consider the quality
2
Very disappointed with the food served. Does not deserve Tunglok name. Though the Fave price is attractive however coming to the food is terrible.
5
Service was prompt and good. Dim Sum is better than their main course.
Chilli crab taste saltish and very spicy, instead of sweet and spicy.
4
Overall, my overseas visitors enjoyed the food. Atmosphere ok. The chairs can be improved to look more presentable.
4
Really nice atmosphere with nice food. Celebrating for my birthday. Surprise by ur staff with nice plate of birthday bun, drinks and blessings. Only thing when upon payment we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t check the bill, we were billed with tea charges when all of us were drinking plain water. 7 of us Per pax of $1.50..... with the 10% & 7%
4
The food is nice! I love the chili crab! Anyway, 1 pax serving is big enough to share among 8 pax...
4
Every dish was well-cooked. The salmon sashimi was supposedly from Norway and fresh! It was an enjoyable dinner and I ate so much! I haven't felt this full in a long time.
4
The price that I paid is very worth it. Although the food is just ok, but in all, we enjoyed the service and the value it gives.
5
Came on a sunday afternoon and it was great, without the usual crowd. Dim sum were value for money and overall a great experience. Good for family gathering
4
The service manager tried her best to serve me and checked with the Chef multiple times for different dishes just to make sure were free from allergen. Great thanks!
3
Service was alright and food is good. We think they should be more organized to cater for lunch crowd.
5
Good service, quality food! We left our portable charger there and staff bother to call us to collect it. The dim sum was awesome!
4
Group of 4 pax for the al la carte buffet. Food was good, but service was slow as we had difficulties getting the attention of service staffs as we are seated at the corner. One Servicing dishes are not fantastic. Chillie crab sauce is nice, but crab tastes frozen and not fresh. Smoked duck is not and, but the wrap is thick and has strong flour taste, as it's not the egg wrap nor popiah skin type. Soup is nice with Generous shark fins with a huge dumpling, served in clear broth. The beef stew in Claypot is very tender. Stir fried beef in black pepper is very tender too. Spinach and kailian are fresh and crunchy. Ngioh hiah a little different from outside. Ma La soup and fish soup quite normal. Love the steam fish as it's very fresh and they serve the whole fish with special nice homemade sauce that's sprinkled on top of the fish. The cereal prawn is fresh and very good too!
4
Nothing to complain abt this place. Portions are generous and service is great. Food-wise, you can't go wrong with Tunglok. Only downside is I wish they hasn't served shark's fin soup. Make sure to use Chope to book a table as it can get rather crowded
4
Not sure if this was the branch we were, as we were somewhere at the ground floor in this shopping centre. However, nice large selection of dim sum, average service, and probably you find as good outside at hawkers at lower price. We liked it though nothing really superspecial, but more than good stuff
4
Nice cosy restaurant on Sat morning. The service is good and prompt. The deco is stylist done up.
Good for gathering but the air-con is abit too strong. For those who get cold easily, please bring a shawl or jacket
5
Great experience delicious food and great service. Went on the weekend it was nice and not overly crowded Guess because it's in the CBD area and mostly crowded on a weekday. Love the deep fried yam truffle dish!
3
I think the service couldn't cater to the crowd though the food taste was okay. More efficient service would make the lunch more pleasant.
4
Good dim sum, nice Chili crab + shark fin soup. Though it's pricey but definitely worthy for a re-visit.
3
You will experience local delights of good quality and great variety
Atmosphere is favorable for business discussions
My preferred: spicy chicken feets
Bon app√©tit!
4
Eight of us had a large variety of local food. It was fast service, good food and inexpensive for a business lunch.
4
This is not my first visit. The dimsum is o e if the better ones I've tried so far. Thumbs up for the truffle dumplings, signature rice rolls, crispy pork buns, steamed cake and egg tarts! Their homemade herbal tea is also not bad but at my last visit, it was a little washed down u fortunately and should be improved. Not that it's bland but the herbal taste is not strong. Otherwise, the food has always been gree
4
Most of the dim sum items were very good, especially the ones with the prawns. The prawns were fresh and succulent, and are a joy to eat. The only sub-par dim sum dish would be the durian puffs, which had too little filling and the filling did not have much durian taste.
3
Very interesting place. Deco is retro while ordering system is via iPad. Most interesting is, food is served by automated tray that will stopped just right in front of your table. The dim sum dishes were nicely done. The braised beef with tendon noodle was a surprised. They were cooked till so soft, easily melts in the mouth

Brought the family to this tea house for lunch, the food had many choices and the serving was generous, had Chili crab, smoke duck . And lots of smaller item and the buffet cost $35 per head , it was cheap and delicious and the service was great though the restaurant was not crowded
