Usually I will bring my friends from overseas to have seafood at this resturant. In my recent visit, I found the food was not that good as before. Kinda of disappointing.
5
My go to for seafood dinner or supper with friends and family. Chili crab and black pepper crabs are great.
5
Great spot for a late night dinner in Tiong Bahru. Wonderful seafood and a great menu selection beyond that.
5
This is a very welcoming, friendly, efficient and well run restaurant. The food is excellent and very good value. I have no hesitation in recommending it for a cheerful and satisfying night out.
4
This restaurant is clean, the staff are friendly and the food is good value for money served in a timely manner. Definitely worth a visit.

Be warned about their pricing. Seafood advertised as a price per kilo. 200g served on your plate, so you don't expect to be charged for 2.5kg, aparently the weight of what gets cut away as well as what you eat. They need to be clear to customers about what the price is for what you get, before hand, otherwise people who eat there the first time will have an unpleasant experience like we did

An established seafood restuarant in Singapore. This one is an exception because it offers tables in the open air. The food is great and the prices are reasonable! All live seafood prices are clearly indicated on the tanks. And u can choose them or leave it to them to size it up accordingly to number of diners.Service was great and the staff were very responsive.Highly recommende

I see an average of 4 stars. I agree wholeheartedly. Agree with most everything I read in the couple of other reviews I perused. So let me just add 2 things that haven't recently been highlighted.1. This is much better and cheaper than No Signboard. 2. The waitress will put some steamed peanuts and wet wipes on the table when you sit down. They are not complimentary. If you don't want them, send them back before your tourist mate starts picking at them and saying "oooo, gross"

Staying in the tiong bahru area? Looking for good cze char stall, look no further. This place has been around for many years serving good cze char food. It used to operate out of one coffeeshop and the diners eat al-fresco, you now have an option to sit indoors as they have expended. If you choose to order seafood, it may not be much cheaper if you think heartlands equate to cheaper food. But the atmosphere eating al-fresco beats eating indoors anytime...their prawn paste chicken and hot plate tofu is good....order the usual cze char dishes and you can't go wrong. be prepared to wait though if it's crowded. Service can be rather slow at times but worth the wait

First night here so went for a walk to check out the local restaurants and eateries and ended up settling for the Sin Hoi Said Seafood Restaurant, and were not disappointed. Large room restaurant with plenty of space, with a wide range of choices (and prices) on the menu. Service was good and lady who served us had a bit of difficulty with English language, but was friendly and we managed. The meals we had, chilli chicken and ginger fish, weren't the cheapest, but they were both excellent, very tasty and more than enough to satisfy us. 2 meals, plus a couple of drinks and the peanuts to start, just under S$50. We know that we can get far cheaper meals, but we were happy with the quality of the meal and the service received. Well worth the S$50

Our first night in Tiong Bahru had us looking for a good restaurant for a late (birthday) dinner. We were enticed by the constant influx of people waiting to be seated and decided to go for it after going around the block. We ordered crispy noodles with juicy shrimps, deep fried cuttlefish and salt and pepper ribs. The noodles are to die for, but the other 2 dishes were just okay. The restaurant is famous for their crabs (based on what was being served around us) but at 9 pm and with only my 12 year old with me, we opted out of ordering crabs. Oh, ordering can be a challenge if you do not speak the language, we ordered steamed rice and had to follow up but it didn't get to our table. Spent a little over $50.
5
Sin Hoi Sai never fails to satisfy! If you want a comfy (read: air-conditioned) place to bring your overseas friends to try local zi char dishes and seafood, this is THE place to do so. It's best to go with a large group of friends so that you can order more dishes and try more delicious food!Atmosphere-wise, it's quite straightforward. A big, air-conditioned room with round tables. Don't expect anything fancy! You know your seafood will be fresh when the tanks are just next door, almost like a mini-aquarium.Food-wise, my favourites were the bamboo clams (so fresh and juicy that very little seasoning was needed to enhance the flavour!), chilli crabs (get the fried mantou to soak up the sauce), salted egg yolk crabs (deliciously creamy) and the coffee pork ribs (the caramelised sticky sauce was finger-licking good).Bring your appetite... and a large group of friends!Definitely worth a return visit

There are 2-3 branches of this Zhi char store and the one at Tiong Bahru road helps keep its reputation alive. There are lots of good choices in the menu, although the seafood esp the crabs can be a tad expensive. The pork ribs is a must, the three egg vegetables, hot plate tofu, chicken Essence frog legs, horfun and Sing Chow Mee fen are some that can easily make you go yum. The pepper crabs are better than the Chilli ones. There is an air con area and an outdoor space if you are not afraid of the heat.

We went for dinner on a Sunday night ard 9pm, the place was fairly empty so we had our pick of indoor or outdoor seating.I like a lot of variety usually, and always end up over ordering... For my bf and I, we got the chili crab, fried man tou, pork rib & watercress soup, stir fried assorted vegetables, sweet & sour pork and fried sliced fish kway teow, all in the small sizes. After we placed our order, I worried that we really ordered too much, but portion sizes ended up being pretty tiny, so we managed to finish with not a lot of effort. Bill inclusive of drinks came up to abt $115.Food was good, but like every other zichar. Best part abt this place to me is that they open till 5am, and they have comfortable, clean air conditioned seating. Service is good without being obtrusive. Will be back next time for supper
3
I do not know if it is because we eat so late (11pm) but where other reviews say the food is great but the service is average, we had the reverse. The service was attentive and not forceful. We only wanted a light meal so went for sharing dishes, whilst the food was enjoyable enough I dare say I could have gone to the market and enjoyed equal or better quality for cheaper than we paid. All in all you will not leave hungry or disappointed, you might just wonder though if you should have treated yourself a bit more or saved your money
4
Very delicious Singaporean 'tze char' food.The coffee ribs and the salted fish fried rice were both very tasty. The rice was very grainy and the crunchy salted fish bits rice added more flavor to the rice. The prawn paste fried chicken was tasty, especially the thigh part. Unfortunately, they used a lot of breast meat too and they were very dry and hard
3
I ordered the cereal prawns and the coffee pork ribs, as the other seafood was rather expensive. I wasn't a great fan of either. The prawns were tasty but it would have been difficult to remove their shells, so I ate those as well, which detracted a bit from the experience. I found the coffee didn't work with the ribs - I far prefer the champagne ribs at the nearby Por Kee Eating House
5
Best black pepper crab, white pepper, cooked perfectly. All the seafood here is excellent. A must if you enjoy seafood. The fried mee ( noodles) is also very good. The waitress that looked after us was very efficient. Liked the napkins packets provided to clean up after the crab feast. The fried fish ( soi hon ?) was excellent.Looking forward to going back there again. Outdoor seating as well as air conditioned dining area. All the seafood is in live tanks. Does not get fresher than that!
4
The food is absolutely lip-smacking, finger-licking delicious.There was just 2 of us so we didn't have the opportunity of ordering numerous dishes; but we were once again thrilled with our dinner of Chilli Crab served with Fried Mantou and a dish Fried Kueh Teow. The service is lacklustre - the staff do their job and that is all. No chatting, no smiling, no pro-activeness. We have no complaints about that, since all our needs were met. Food was ordered, food arrived. Drinks were ordered and arrived. We needed bibs and were given bibs. There was no issue with anything.The inside room is air-conditioned but it is also very noisy due to the tiled floors. The restaurant is a favourite with locals and expats and is always busy.Price-wise it isn't cheap but for the quality of the food, we didn't mind at all paying $100.00 for 2 people including drinks (and the sneaky nuts and hand towels). I was fully aware beforehand of the "secret charges" but it's not excessive...and the nuts are yummy - and you really do need those hand towels if you're eating the chilli crab.But forewarned is forearmed. Just say no the nuts and handtowels as soon as you are seated, to avoid being charged.Enjoy

Sin Hoi Sai has been around for many years and they are known for their Singaporean 'tze char' dishes.We had the chili crab and pepper crab, which were excellent. The deep fried 'man tou' dipped with the chili crab sauce was heavenly.The stir fried 'hor fun' was delicious as you can taste the 'wok hei', which is typical of well-cooked Chinese food.The service was a little slow and inattentive as they seemed shorthanded
4
We just had dinner there. Coffee flavored ribs, chilly chicken, and ladies fingers were amazing. We enjoyed less the crispy noodles. Not cheap but the beer was not so expensive as in other restaurants. No frills ambiance, very China style.
3
Food is only average. Below what I expected after hearing about this place.
Service is poor.
Place is so crowded and pack...
5
After being to many of Singapore's Chili Crab establishments, I can't say enough how this is the best flavour and consistency around. There are other items on the menu but you just can't go past the Lobster and Crab. Give it a go, you'll thank yourself for it
5
An old eating establishment that has preserved the old flavours of yesteryears. I was surprised by the kitchen's rendition of Hokkien Meet. Although it cannot use the fat alkaline noodles from Malaysia, it was beautifully braised like the KL version. Must try. The flowers clams with chilli and garlic was ocean fresh
2
Reasonable price but average food. Tried the coffee rib, yangzhou fried rice and braised toufu. Nothing really exceptional. Service is poor. Upon arrival, I was told that only outside tables are available since I did not make any reservation. However, another group after us (without any reservation) were ushered into the aircon section by another staff. It was only when some customers seated outside started smoking that the staff switched us to the inner section. And we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our orders.

On our 'to do' list when coming to Singapore was to sample the famous local chili and black pepper crab. I researched and agonised over the best place to go, based on this forum and advice of friends. In the end the problem was taken care of by our friends who live here, and when I said we wanted to go out for a chili crab dinner, they brought us here, and we were not disappointed!It is not flash; tables inside or out (we chose outside), basic utensils supplied. Before we even ordered we had a small plate of pickled vegetables to try.To start - deep fried prawns and fish cakes- the latter looked dry but were moist and delicious.Then one chili crab, one black pepper crab, fried rice, coffee ribs and a few large beers.The highlight was the crab, though the ribs were very tasty also. My friend had enquired and agreed the price for what they called two small crabs, but they were plenty big enough for all four of us to get a decent taste, and the chili crab came with plenty of rich chili crab sauce with the obligatory buns to mop it up.They supplied bibs for the messy westerners, though in fact my was clean by the end to not really necessary. Hands gets completely covered in sauce - part of the fun! You can wash your hands in the bathroom afterwards (though there was no soap).We were the only non-Asian diners to that has to say something! Authentic, delicious Singaporean food, and we got the chili crab ticked off the list. Recommended.$219 for four including three large beers
5
This restaurant isn't wasting effort on plush decore but it certainly puts effort into providing good food.The menu is quite extensive and the prices are reasonable. A great guide is the numbers of locals eating there. The service is good but it is a busy place. Certainly one to go to if you enjoy seafood.

Had dinner with family on Saturday, 2 July, 2016.There were 5 of us at dinner. Dishes ordered were stir fried french beans, stir fried mixed vegetables with prawns, Har Cheong Kai, sweet and sour fish, deep fried fish skin, fried man tou, sambal sweet potato leaves.Everyone loved the stir fried french beans which were beautifully cooked and delicious.The stir fried mixed vegetables were well cooked as well but not as well received as the french beans! Others in our group said the chicken was on the dry side as it was over fried! Deep fried fish skins very good, as well as fried man tou.Loved the sweet and sour fish, beautifully executed with just the right balance of sweetness and sourness! Batter on fish was not too hard or soft, just perfect and fish was soft and juicy.Up to this point, food was served on time as ordered. There were no gaps in serving what was ordered.We wanted more vegetables and ordered a plate of sambal fried sweet potato leaves. It took about 20 minutes before it was served and we did not like it as it was way too salty.Overall, it was a dinner that surpassed my expectations as I have had other dining experiences in the East Coast branch which was not great! Service is okay considering it was Saturday night and the place was packed! I wasn't expecting too much from this restaurant and it turned out for the better! I am not sure how consistent they are but this review is for the one time dining experience I have this time!So do keep up the good work in cooking your best to nurture the many hungry souls who walk into your restaurant

We have been here a few times, since we live in Singapore. After doing the complete Expat thing, this is a relief. Its an authentic local restaurant. Do not except any frills with the service. However service is good and prompt. The staff are friendly and efficient. Regulars enjoy special service. The best drink would be the Beer. Juice available, very sweet and probably not natural.The crab is excellent, We have had both Chilli and Pepper crab (a spicy dish). We prefer the latter. Excellent quality of Sri Lankan Crab with lots of flesh. Best accompanied by the local Buns (we prefer the dried buns to the steamed ones). The Seafood or Chicken Fried rice is a close second.The cereal Prawn is a must try. We stumbled upon it by chance and loved it. Keep away from the fish soup which is an acquired taste.Generally a great local experience and best of all its not a tourist place at all. Most foreigners visiting here would be residents
4
This is very good cherchar Chinese food. We had tasty yang chow fried rice, fish soup, sweet and sour pork and fuyong omelette. I would recommend all of these. Homemade hot barley drink was authentic and refreshing.Service was prompt and efficient. Good value for money!
4
This was near our hotel and was recommended by our taxi driver, known locally for their chilli crab, it was pricey, messy but really nice.
3
Popular local seafood restaurant. Casual, outside seating, no frills. Nice food, the Black Pepper Crab here is especially good. Overall relative expensive therefore only average rating.
5
The best fried grouper and chili crab in town. Located just behind the bus stop in a busy residential and commercial area. This is a must-try visit when you come over to Singapore, to have a taste of what chili crab is. 👍🏽
5
Crispy fish skin is so crunchy & tasty sans the oily feel. Ordered two kinds of cereal prawns, original & with salted egg. Love both! Use your bare hands when having black pepper crabs, enjoy the spicyness!
3
this place used to be an institution but now it is not as popular before. my guess is the expensive prices and the quality of the service frustrating when the server doesnt understand you
2
I was hoping for an evening of local seafood dishes as I had heard good things about this restaurant. However, after I was seated, the problems with the service began. I was essentially ignored for 10 minutes while I watched other parties being seated and served. I finally was asked as to what I wanted to drink and what I wanted to eat. I was served, the food was just ok, nothing special. My biggest complaint was that no one came to ask if I wanted something else to drink or eat. I finally had to stop some one to ask for the check. Not a good experience and very pedestrian food
3
Had a late supper here with friends and there were some standout dishes. The harcheong chicken, marinated in prawn paste and then deep fried, were crispy on the outside yet the meat was tender. The chicken pieces were also chopped into larger pieces, instead of the usual small pieces that you find at other restaurants. It went great with the belachan chilli.The sambal kang kong was nice too, but I thought it was too spicy. You can ask them to lower the heat level but my friends like it hot. We also ordered a plate of fish slice hor fun noodles - this was tasty too and the fish slices were fresh.The place can get noisy, especially if you are seated in the air-conditoned room. There was a table of around 10 British male tourists who had a number of beers - they were not rowdy but did contribute a major part of the noise. If the evening is cool, you can choose to have an al fresco dinner
4
This restaurant is almost next door to the Nostalgia Hotel, the food is very good but one thing that in my opinion is a chick , they will bring you a small plate of brown beans without asking, that you will assume that is a free, but not they charge you $3 they also charge you for the serviettes$1.20. Pity but the food is good, my advise is that if you go there tell them that you don't want the not very nice beans
1
Just when we thought that Tripadvisor had sorted out all the bad restaurant apples, along comes this dinosaur of a place that blatantly steals from its customers and thinks they won't get caught. No sooner had we sat down when along came a waiter dropping off a small bowl of nuts and some paper napkins. When it came time to pay some of our foods were itemized in English while others were written in Chinese. I asked what the Chinese charges were and was told it was for the nuts and napkins. That they tried to sneak these charges through hiding behind their language shows it was attempted theft. Shame on you Sin Hoi Sai. You should close your restaurant and start up a pick pocketing network
3
Had dinner here in a group of 4. The prawn paste chicken, French beans in sambal sauce, and another green veg, was ok. The steamed baby squids was very good. We sat just outside the restaurant in the corridor under the fan, which my friends say was quieter and more pleasant than sitting inside the noisy air conditioned indoors which was full that night. Total bill was around S$120 for 4, which is reasonable for Singapore. The Tiong Bahru area is a bit bohemian and nice to walk around, with other F&B and cafe/dessert outlets to choose from. Probably won't return to this place.
5
I was there for dinner. There was a great variety of seafood available. I had the crab bee hoon and it was excellent though it was a little pricey. The service was great; the staff was attentive to the needs of the customers.
4
Good range of seafood and fried noodles and rice dishes. Crab is very popular. The Chilli Crab though has a lot of chilli oil, and not that much egg. Those with senstive palates be forewarned.
4
We had good dinner with 3 dishes. Service was excellent. Food was great. will definitely go there again
4
I had dinner there with my colleagues from Taipei and Beijing under our Hong Kong colleague's recommendation. The crab and fish are very fresh and delicious. the vegetable is also with good quality.
4
My friend came visiting me from overseas, as she is staying at tiong bahru area Sin Hoi Sai seems like a good choice for crab.It's a pretty old restaurant with both outdoor and airconditioned indoor seating. I prefer outdoor as the night is rather cooling as compared to the enclosed noisy indoor seating (even thought I love to dine sweat free)Wanted to try both chilli and salted egg crab but their crab size is rather big at approx 950g to 1.4kg (it's just right for 2 pax). with only 2 of us, we decided on the chilli crab as that's probably the better known crab dish for my foreign friend to try.Crab are on seasonal pricing at sgd60 per kg, do call them up and check before going down and must reserve seat especially if u prefer indoor seating. We ordered sambal kangkong, prawn paste chicken, deep fried mantou (chinese bun without filling) and 1 chilli crab weighing 950g.Love the spiciness of the sambal kangkong, recommended for spicy lover. The prawn paste chicken is tender yet crispy on the outside. The crab is good too, perfect match with the mantou!Total damage less than sgd100 for the meal. Thumbs up for their attentive service, they provide apron in case u worried about staining ur clothes while savoring the crab! Their braised peanuts wow me too, it's soft and full of flavor. (This cost about $3 I think. Can't remember where I place the receipt) Overall it's a good experience.
4
Dropped in here for a late night meal as it was close to the hotel. A bit pricey. However served a yummy mee goreng which was a low cost meal and was delicious! This place is supposed to be opened till 4 in the morning. Great place if you are in the neighborhood
4
Had dinner here after a very disappointing chilli crab at Lau Sa Pat. We went there because it was close to our hotel and looked like it was popular with locals. The food was very good with a big menu, and the service efficient and friendly. We saw some locals with a chilli crab and it looked excellent. Would definitely eat here again if in the area
4
This is mainly a seafood restaurant but they also serve local dishes such as fried rice, shrimp paste chicken, fried noodles etc. I like their water cress soup which is good. Their black pepper crab us really good and also the fried meehoon. There are alfresco dining and air con room too. Dessert and drinks are quite exotic too like aloe Vera, lime juice, barley, taro paste with ginko
4
We had their live chili crab and also fresh vegetables. Both were excellent. The service was friendly. We stayed at the hotel close by and was very happy with our choice in this Tiong Bahru neighborbood. On weekend nights, they are open until 5 AM in the morning, perfect for night owls

Zero... The 1st horrible and worst restaurant in Singapore I ever seen and experienced. $388 CNY set meal for 10 pax plus 8 cans of coke with final billing at $450 at worst unprofessional services, causing everyone left with stomach not full, frustrated, spoilt mood, felt like being cheated and 100% overcharged. Its not a proper meal but a 3-5 pax size steamboat, no recommendation or explanation for customer order and ZERO service.After a plate of 10 slices salmon LouHei, then we were told and wasted 30 mins just waiting for their small promfret fishhead to defrost. Then 1 hr waiting for the cold claypot to get heat up and finally requested to change to metal pot coz kids all hungry. Geoduck clam served raw with super strong wasabi that none can eat after 2 slices. Abalone served plain and dry up while waiting for claypot to heat. 10 pork slices as shabu shabu. 10 fried beancurd. Half-dry bee hoon soaked dry the littlesoup based. 2 egg tofu. 1 plate of green vege. 20 mins waited for 2 glasses of water. Forgotten to serve us desserts, no one attend to us even when we complaint claypot not heating up. China servers speak loud, dropping bowls here and there etc...Restaurant? Worst than any coffee shop Tze Char stalls, worst than any hawker centre and definitely overcharge customers. Everything expensive even for a la carte order, all I can say is... AVOID & NOT WORTH TO VISIT & NOT WORTH SPENDING
2
There are so many Zi char places in singapore - No need to ever come here. Food is not good. Lost its charm even if it's in Tiong Bahru. Expensive. Why bother?
4
Good local food at good prices....nothing to dislike. All good. Sit outside to enjoy the balmy evenings.
4
A very established name in the seafood restaurant eateries.I have eaten here for many years from seeing their early years in an old coffee-shop to their now spanking clean and bright restaurant.They have maintained their freshness of the seafood - was there last month when I paid a visit after being away from Singapore.Like everything else in Singapore, prices have all gone up - but at least the food was delicious in this old familiar place
4
Ended up eating here because we were famished, it was the closest restaurant to our hotel, and the packed tables seemed like a good sign. And yes, it may seem a bit pricey, but the serving sizes were big enough, and the food was really good. I recommend the Char Kway Teow, Fried Chicken Wings, Sweet & Sour Pork
3
Just finished dinner at this restaurant and was very satisfied. I had an eggplant appetizer along with Two Different Shrimp dish. That may not be the exact name but it's close. Half the plate was fried shrimp with a mustard type sauce and the other with a mayo and horseradish sauce. The food was very good and the menu relatively easy to understand. The place was quite busy and most of the dining is outside. Overall it was a nice experience and a lucky find when i had no idea where to go
4
I see that a number of other folks have commented that they found the food expensive here and I suppose compared to a number of other options it is. But for us coming from the US to our first ever trip to Singapore, we found the quality and price totally worth it. We were in a hotel that was literally five doors up the street so it was super convenient. And to our neophyte taste buds, it was so good we came there three nights in a row. There wasn't anything we didn't think was good. And if it was overpriced compared to what you would get for comparable (if you could find such flavors in most of the US) it was still a value. We particularly loved the Chile Crab, the Coffee Ribs, and the Fried Fish Skin (think cracklings
4
Ironically, we stayed 3 minutes walk away from here, but we did not dine here this time. However, we have eaten here at least 5 times in the past 3 years with our foodie friends who live in SIngapore.A must have is the Coffee Ribs. We also liked the Cereal Prawns and Black Pepper Crab.And yes, it's expensive. You wouldn't know it from the plastic stools that you sit on, but we do like the local atmosphere! We paid SGD 350 for a dinner for 4 adults back in 2011 with only 1 crab, prawns, ribs, clams and veggies (no alcohol)! It's probably even more expensive now, but I would still go back for the coffee ribs but that's all
3
Good Cantonese food can be expected here. Boss is doing so well, he has bought up a few shop lots along the same row.This is one coffee shop place that charges restaurant prices. Prices have been worryingly going up quite dramatically even for the simple noodle and rice dishes.Never ask the staff to recommend dishes especially seafood. Unless you are prepared to pay at least $100-$200 per head.Staff are friendly and efficient
5
I was refered by a local friend to go there. I never regret it. It is by far the best tasting food I had in singapore. Its chilli sauce and black peppered crabs, the salted egg prawns, etc... you will never go wrong. The place is just soso but its clean and the staffs are good. So it is a must try for me
2
Made a big mistake and didn't read the reviews here before going. Don't order the market priced items unless you want a big surprise. I was expecting a bill in the 60 to 80 range based on the general menu prices. I was hit with a $150 bill for two people with one soft drink each. The food was decent but it wouldn't have been worth the $60-80 I originally expected.
3
very famous seafood restaurant. food is good but price is a little expensive. black pepper crab and live fish with hongkong steamed is recommand.
4
The seafood is fresh and the garlic bamboo prawns are delicious. The iced lime tea is a must have! Cools you down after a meal. Relatively reasonable price for the kind of food served.
3
try the mee goreng!
4
Claypot pig's liver :)

They have KL's DAI LOKE MEEN.

Had seafood dinner here in late 2012 with a group of friends. The food was ok but nothing too special.Some of the items were "market priced" and they were not especially impressive. When we got the bill, we were all extremely shocked - some of the items were priced priced so high that the overall bill was about three times what we expected. We were able to negotiate the bill down somewhat but really, be careful here, and in fact the food was not sufficiently nice that I would recommend anyway, even if you order carefully around expensive items
1
Is this really a place to eat or they jus trying to chop tourist money?!?! A small cup of aloe Vera drink cost $6???!!!!! What does it made of??? No bird nest n is just a slice of lemon n few aloe Vera and it does taste that nice too. Ordered sambal kang kong and the veg were tasteless. So called a famous resturant which not up to standard at all and even charge 10% service charge,wth!!!! Never will I return to this place again
4
This eating place has been around for a long time. Dishes are good amd felt personally, standards have dipped a little and portions have shrunk. Perhaps its due to the rise in costs. Nevertheless its still one if the popular eating place you can find late at night in Tiong Bahru. Fav dishes are the steamed Enoki mushroom topped with fried garlic and Yee Mian
3
Need I say more? Every mood is spoilt here. Being a famous seafood restaurant in Singapore, it should give what it is well known for -- crab is the main thing in seafood. The size and weight of the crabs served to us looked really up to standard--not till we cracked the shells and found very little meat in it
