We stopped every time we saw a Toast Box while traveling and was never disappointed. We grabbed anything that looked good and loved it all. I brought home some kaya and can't wait to dig into it. Yummmm.

Visited this place in the morning. It was so crowded that we found it difficult to find a place.
Got the simple toast and coffee. The toast had generous helping of butter and was divine.
Drinking local coffee is a "must have" experience!

There are 2 toast boxes in Great World city. One by the main entrance and another downstairs in the foodcourt.
Both serve good cheap food. no problems.

Look, I can't remember the names of my favorite there - pizza on bread, long slim cream filled pastry, and their donuts. Always fresh in the mornings when I would stop by, one of the best smelling shops in Great World!

Really like the kaya toast, the noodles and coffee they have. The price also reasonable. Mostly the shop is not too big so be it will make you to queuing during peak hour.

Very Singapore stye coffee shop serving common local coffee, toasted bread with kaya (pandan and coconut jam), boiled egg etc. The kaya itself is not as sweet as some other brand and they serve food like nasi lemak, mee rebus, mee siam and curry chicken. A good way to start your day with a dose of local coffee

First I love Great World, and Toast Box in Great World is a plus for me. I like hang out with my friends for breakfast here. I like most of the food here, coffee is the best if you like strong coffee. Sometimes you have to wait a bit longer to get the table

I love this place for its simple yet great value for money teas and coffees. If you are bored of having the same old Starbucks or Whitehouse coffees or are wondering if the hawker center teh-c would be good, just drop by to enjoy the amazing tea

Pretty good healthy food options here. Menu is composed of soups, salads, and sandwiches mostly. Also some seafood and steak options. Food was well-prepared and was ready in no time. Smoothie options here too and coffee along with ice coffees too. Kids menu is available. Good spot in the Great World Mall. It's on the east side of the mall facing Kim Seng Road by the entrance where the free shuttle goes to and from Chinatown. There's room for strollers, and babychairs are available

I love kaya toast and as I live close to Great World City I have visited this toast box more than once. Me and my boyfriend goes here regularly. Service is fast and nice, eggs are soft (as they should be), kopi and tarik is delicious, and the toasts splendid. Crack the eggs, mix in some soy sauce, dip the toasts and enjoy with the coffee. Yum!
