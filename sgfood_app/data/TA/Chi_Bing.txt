I've been there for many times and i like their free flow & self service side dishes. Their kimchi is very good, the spiciness and crunchiness is good.

I visited again! But the steamed egg did not impress me as much as my first visit. We ordered sotong n pork with instant mee..was nice but a tad salty.. fried chicken was so so.. but still recommended...

Wonderful second experience and my friends went back for more.
Bingsu was great...steam egg was great... we had a heavy dinner in some other places that day, so just had these 2 delights when we passed by.. enought to make out friday night memorable!

Surprisingly, it was quite empty when we arrived at 6.30pm on sunday. This restaurant is at the corner of the shopping centre, so most people might not know it exists unless they walk on the outside of the mall.We decided to order one bingsu to share. The portion size is enough for 2-3 people. It was shaved quite finely and was on par with another bingsu place we love. The nuts went well with the red bean, injeolmi (rice cake) and shaved ice. Service was quick. If you want to call the waiter, there is a call button on the tables

Been here many times & I love their pan fry and fried chicken as well as bingsuU have tried both mild & medium spicy level and haven't gone any further yet Fried chicken is good for 4 pax hence it's difficult to order this when u have a small group. Hope they will offer half portion. Just a suggestion.

The whisper and talk of Bingsu is eveywhere in Singapore. As we were not in any part of Asia for 2 years......What is Bingsu? Aha, shaved ice or snow ice topped with various goodies. A copy of Ais Kacang perhaps but the Bingsu history went back at least a few decades. We had the Strawberry Bingsu, the original Patbingsu, one with Melons and ..... a few more things as snack. The taste were good but IMHO, I still prefer the Cendol made by the Hokkien speaking Indian Uncle, sold from his faithful 3 wheeled pushcart at Jalan Dewa in Sungai Petani, Malaysia
