My foreigner friend loves smabal and flat fish. So we went Lai Huat with high expectations as the claim was the best sambal fish in town.
The fish is dry and tasteless. Very disappointed. Service is good

Went there for lunch and their lunch set is something that is good value for money in the cbd area - from $7.80 onwards that comes with a drink. The pig trotters beehoon, and mee goreng are probably the best choices!
5
Love coming back to this bustling place. The food is always nice, but do not go there when you're on a diet.
4
repeated visit. never fails to satisfy. had the curry fishhead set. will certainly come back again...
5
Friend requested sambal fish.. and it tasted good. Food serving is fast. Every dishes were good - sambal Kang kong, prawn pasted chicken and omelette
5
Good value food! I love their pig trotters bee hoon and would recommend it. It's so crowded, so do make reservations.
5
Enjoyed the nice food that was recommended by the attentive servers. Food also arrived promptly despite the restaurant was appeared to be full house.
4
Came here for lunch with an ex-local. Previous specials all gone but current menu is still good. Sambal Pork was excellent and my colleagues choices were good also. Service a little slow but it was a busy lunchtime
3
Food was a little underwhelming and there a few dishes that we selected were not available. The deer meat we ordered had a very pungent smell but they were nice enough to switch another dish for us. Sambal fried fish was good and it should be since it's their signature dish.

Bought voucher and made reservations via Chope last week. However, when I was there to claim my voucher, Lai Huat do not acknowledge and keep saying they never have any deal with Chope. The boss of Lai Huat said Chope is only helping them to make reservations, they never sell vouchers for them. I have bought $300 voucher and they insisted the most I can only utilised $100 only. I have show them all my booking confirmation with Chope and cash voucher. The boss saying this kind of cases happened with Chope already many times. Then why this still never fixed? How come Chope still can selling vouchers on your behalf? After arguing for an hour, they finally agreed for me to use all $300 voucher.This case took me an hour to explained and explained with the staff and boss. Very lousy and bad experience with them. Will not be visiting anymore

Pretty good food; excellent sambal fish. However it's extremely noisy and crowded! Tables much too close together.
4
Food was good especially coffee ribs and their fried rice.
Service was prompt and food was served quickly.
4
Place was pretty quiet, most items were done well, service good !! Certain items abit more expensive but still can eat a decent meal if you choose the least expensive items !!
5
The quality of the food is consistent & yummy. I been here 4 times & am still impressed. Great job! üëçüèºüëçüèº

Food comes fast. Quality is consistent. Value for money. Wide variety of selection. Highly recommend their signature fried fish with sambal, fish head curry, curry pork chop with rice, deep fried baby squid and deep fried chicken wings!
4
Their signature dish is a must have! My family love their samba! Other than that, you can try their salted egg chicken and coffee ribs. Worth a try.
4
Abundance of food.. and sambal fish was the best. Place was not overly crowded on a weekday. Good for big eaters.
5
Will definitely return for the Sambal Promfret! Most of the time egg noodle is being used. Neat idea to use Mee Sua instead. Very palatable. Yum yum. Our overseas guest enjoyed the food too! Achar i's a tantalising appetiser.

Our friend came half an hour late after us and ordered immediately. After 45mins, there was still no sign of his food which is from the set menu & should have been easily prepared. When he cancelled, the food arrived but he insisted on returning it
1
We went for the buffet. Food and tea ordered never came. Staff were overwhelmed with only 3 servers in the entire crowded restaurant. Food standard has also dropped tremendously as compared to a year ago when we came for my mum's birthday lunch buffet. The more expensive items like beef and prawns have been removed from the menu. Overall experience poor and would not go again....even with the promo prices, etc, this place is a no-go 
5
Nice Food, Prompt Attention & Great Service although we need to wait awhile, guess lunchtime is always packed!;)
2
food was not nice. charges 30cents for ice water and is non-refillable. whereas lime juice that costs $3 is refillable. somewhat illogical.
all in all, not value for money. won't be visiting again
3
The signature dish was so-so compared with other branches but the one main grouse I had is that they charge for water by the cup! What's wrong with refilling water??
5
Both food and service are excellent. It was my 2nd visit to the restuarant. Love their coffee ribs and prawn paste chicken wings.
5
Food is served promptly. Great for team lunch as waiting time for food is short. 2nd time here, food still tasty.
5
Visit on saturday evening. Service is prompt and food is nice. This is my 2nd visit and will return again.
5
Service is good and food is delicious. Price is reasonable. Curry fish head is fragrant though a little spicy. Generous portion
5
$29.90+ per adult and $17.90+ per kid below 5 and with $20 off every $100 spent after liking and sharing their FB post. The prices exclude drinks and condiments. We had 11 adults and 1 kid and it cost about $30 each adult after discount. For a buffet standard, the food is surprisingly good. Definitely will be looking to patronize the restaurant again

I always bring overseas visitors to Lai Huat (China Street)for the experience of favorite local dishes like the sambal fish and coffee ribs. The visitors are always delighted with the food. The only issue is that when the restaurant is busy, the atmosphere is too noisy and it makes it difficult for conversations to be carried out
3
The on-line booking I made on 3/2/2017 whch was confirmed by Chope was not honoured by the restaurant. They said they were already fully booked and will not entertain booking via on-line. This obviously was not reflected over the booking platform when I made the on-line reservation. There should be more updated communication between restaurants and Chope Team in the future to avoid such inconvenience as we have to search for another restauran on foot
4
Food was great and service fast. The service staff were attentive and polite as well. Desserts were a little disappointing.
4
All good food can be found here. No regrets. The ohi Ni (yam) is very authentic. The chicken prawn paste is served hot .
4
the food is delicious. Set lunch include drink cost about $9. ordered pig trotter beehoon. really good.
4
The price abit exp..not worth for value. The crab mee hoon not nice n exp...but i like their chicken wings..samba fish super spicy......

My local colleague and I walked the few blocks from our offices to genuine home cooked Hainanese food in this informal restaurant. I left all the ordering to my colleague. She chose Hainanese pork chop, macadamia nut with vegetables and sambal sotong (squid) all served with steamed rice and hot, spicy pickles. The whole meal was delicious. With a can of green tea to wash everything down I felt well fed and watered and ready to tackle an afternoon of work

We come to enjoy the buffet promotion at china street branch. If u have really big stomach the buffet really value for money as the portion can be considered not small.Some of their siganture dish such as the sambal fish, bbq pork bun, choice of live prawn, choice of cray fish and fish maw soup only can order 1x and served first. These dishes especially the sambal fish very nice as the fish crispy outside and have soft texture inside. The sambal very nice.The unlimited dish that we manage to order are macadamia nut with seasonal veggie (quite nice), seafood fried rice, singapore beehoon, salted chicken.Staff quite nice and attentive. Ambience of this restaurant also not bad as it has aircon and not really crowded.Overall we quite satisfied with the food and service. 3.5 stars rated out of 5 stars

Enjoy great local homecook flavours for visitors and family gatherings at this "no frills" restaurant. Like the informal casual setting for lunch and/or dinner. The sambal fish is fantastic and the set menu is of good value to the patrons. Went back multiple occasions to try various dishes and all taste equally delicious

First time visit lai huat due to groupon deal. Location wise, its pretty quiet during wkends and public holiday. Order the curry fish head which is pretty spicy for those who love spicy food. Their dishes are pretty good, slightly better than zhi char places at coffeeshop or hawker centre. Their sambal squids is good and their food portion is reasonable. Will probably visit again
3
I use Chope voucher book online and manager told us that they have inform Chope that they do not want to sell any more of their voucher through chope.. In the end, he unhappily accepted our voucher. I feel the manager should be more gracious to accept and resolve any discrepancies with Chope directly and not showing his displeasure to me

A family style run restaurant serving zi char style dishes. Service was fine but a bit slow to response as they seem to be short of staff. We order the their signature dish sambal fish, my sister liked it because the fish was fired crispy and topped with spicy sambal. But personally, I didn't fancy it as I find both the fish and the sambal too dry, seems more like 2 dishes served in 1 plate. Taste of the dishes we ordered was slightly better than average but probably not worth their price tag unless you have discount voucher.
