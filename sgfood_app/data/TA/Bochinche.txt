Went there for lunch on a weekday. Nice atmosphere in the restaurant. The tuna empanadas was delicious as was the main course, the flank steak. Overall a good meal and experience

Have been searching for places that serve grilled octopus. Finally found it and is totally satisfied with the way it’s served and how it tasted!
4
We ordered steak, fish and empanadas. Steak was nicely done and juicy on the inside. Empanadas are always a favourite over here. Fish tasted average.

Had a wonderful lunch earlier today, great friendly service, great food too! Loves the ribeye, very nicely done!! Will be back for sure!! Great decor too!!

Singapore had its good share of great steakhouses for all price ranges.What made Bochinche unique was its Argentine meats. Are they different for most of the high end US and AU primes/wagyu that you get in Singapore? Definitely, if you are into steaks!We tried the 300g Ribeye and it was exceptional. It hit the right not a of taste with a perfect blend of red meat, fat and char. The meat was soft and almost melted in the mouth. We also tried the starters and because I do not have much knowledge of Argentine cuisine, they looked and tasted like Spanish tapas ( in fact we ordered Chorizo croquettes). It didnâ€™t matter much, as at the end, they tasted delicious.There are many more good candidates to taste under their grill section and hence I will definitely be back for those in the future.A good new find for meat lovers and steak

It was lunch time in the Central Business District and everything was in a rush. Getting into boChinche seemed to usher in some semblance of order. For a very limited space and time - the counter seats were surprisingly comfortable and the food was pretty good. First time having the Provoleta was an eye opener - it was yummy - as long as you ate it warm. (Just don't let it cool off - only slight minus point). Beef Empanadas were tasty. Watermelon salad was unexpectedly good (normally not a salad person!). Steak and Fish dishes were acceptable. I would recommend to friends

We went there for a business lunch and ordered the lunch set. The steak was on the saltier side, and the accompanying salad was also a tad bit too heavy on the seasoning. This may be a day when the chef isn't performing as well, because I've been here multiple times and the steak were done nicely.

What a great dinner!When eating the "Bife de Lomo" I felt like I was back in Argentina. Grilled to perfection!Needless to say the other dishes were delicious as well and we had a truly amazing dinner.And although we couldn't get a regular table, sitting at the bar and seeing the chefs at work was a great alternative and we enjoyed ourselves.Whether you want to impress a date; or surprise your spouse/partner... this might be one of the best options in Singapore! Enjoy

Had a wonderful dinner with friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious, and the service was prompt. There's hardly anything to dislike about this place
5
If I am not travelling and my work schedule allows, going to Bochinche for lunch totally makes my day! Since the set menu changes every week and always showcases creative dishes using only the freshest of ingredients, I always know it will be a hit - whether with friends or business partners. The staff is kind and the chef welcoming, which makes the experience even nicer. I highly recommend Bochinche for lunch as well as for dinner : good food & vibes guaranteed

I had dinner with a friend in this restaurant. The ambiance is really nice and the design very well done. The staff is friendly but the food was really average and poor. I had a service as a starter and I did not find it good. The meat was really average, not tasty and full of spices. Dessert was really good
5
I believe it is the only Argentinian restaurant in Singapore and the South American nation is well represented. All we ordered was delicious and we had a great evening witg our friends. Good steak and good entries with some nice Argie wine and we all were happy. I do recommend

Share the Chorizo Croquettes to start which were lovely, Chips were also lovely, the steak and the service was a let down. We wee not asked if we wanted any sauce, but eventually got mustard after getting Simeone attention half way through my steak. The Ribeye was to fatty, decor was lovely but with a bill for $285, $85 was wine, I can't see any reason to go bac

Visited because most of the places where closed on this Sunday. Good and original south American food Took a seabas ceviche which was really tasty, then sunny side eggs on toast and avocados, with coriander ... Also Good and original.Wine available by the glass (mostly south American but also some French)Free fresh water served along the meal.Place has a certain charm

For steak lover, order their skirt steak and Rib eye. My friends love the rib eye, but I personally prefer the skirt steak. My friends felt that the skirt steak its slightly salty though. But why not pair with a red glass I am sure it will be fine to go with. I will said reasonable price with good food. Good location, no hassle of searching this shop. Their dessert, Creme brulee, is good too. Its a very cosy place, alot people hanging around the bar counter for drinks. Service so far ok, I dont need too much of service but at least attentive wil do. Arrangement for a friend birthday was smooth too, as what I have requested. Definitely will be coming back again

We have been several times to this place, also at its previous location. We love the tapas styled appetizers a lot. Again this time, this did not disappoint, on the contrary. The food is very good. However, one of the waiters had absolutely no idea what he was doing, although he looked and was dressed as if he owned the place. Anyway, maybe he had a bad day. What bothered us the most was the incredible wind coming from the place next door through the open spaces between the walls and also from through the front door. Pretty incredible at times. Very unpleasant to witness and it kind of destroyed the good atmosphere because nobody seemed to care. It was good to have a table this time (last time we were sitting on the kitchen bar) but next time we won't be sitting there again given this experience. So yes, we'll be going back because the food is good and they have some good wines as well. They just need to pay (much) more attention to other details as well if you want to keep charging those prices.

My friends and I didn't even have the chance to eat and taste the food. This review was based on the service prior to it. We booked this place on Tuesday for our lunch on Sunday at 12:15 PM. The guy from the restaurant named Joseph took that order.When we arrived there on Sunday, they said we had no reservation. Joseph said there was no available table inside with the hot and humid weather, so he offered outside since we had no reservation. After we kept insisting that we have reserved, he finally revealed that there was reservation at 11:15 AM under the name that was ours but clearly it was ours because it sounded similar (like the name "Clara" but it was written "Ara").So, he made two mistakes and we thought that was the end of it. First the timing, then the name. Apparently when we made the order, the caller already spelled the name "C for Charlie, L for Lima, A for Alpha..." and so on. So, at least he should get that right and made one mistake instead of two. The worst is yet to come.He said sorry, but in his defence, he said that he called one day prior to reservation to confirm, which we never receive it. Second, he also said that he sent text message one day prior to but we never received it either. Again to his defence, "Since we tried to call and send text message and have no response, thus we gave away your 12:15 reservation to the others." When we finally able to check the phone, there was one miscall and one text message; however it was on Sunday one hour prior to that, the day we supposed to have lunch based on our reservation. Since we were at church, we couldn't access the phone.So, basically he has no integrity by lying to our faces. The mistakes he made were such a disappointment especially we have spelled the name and was still wrong. His action to give us solution was not helping since we clearly asked and have reserved the table inside where we could sit face to face for fellowship with friends. The greatest disappointment was related to his lack of integrity by telling lies. That was unacceptable. That was a disgrace. The bad thing it reflects to the restaurant. We will never want to come here no matter what, and we will make sure that we share this news to everyone so people will not get the same disappointment like we got, especially from the employee named Joseph

It is Christmas Eve and we could not have a reservation for 730pm so we ate at 6pm. The sirloin and ribeye steaks are great. Order the creme brûlée for dessert! Done to perfection!!

Loved the casual dining atmosphere and friendly staff.Fave was the grilled octopus - fantastic crunch and the with the sauce, the texture is really sublime. Even my partner who doesn't like seafood loves this dish. Not too much of a fan of the burger, meat was dry. We had ordered this after reading reviews on it and was disappointed.We don't usually indulge in cocktails as they are overrated in a lot of places in Singapore and over priced but the martini here was really a standout!Looking forward to being back to try different things on the menu

I wish I had taken photos of the dishes I had at Bochinche, the Argentina steak house at Amoy Street. In my defence, the food was too delicious, I was enjoying myself too much. My husband and I started with Spinach, goat cheese, raisins and pine nuts empanadas; as well as Sea bass ceviche, onion, radishes & preserved lemon. The spinach empanadas were really beautiful - the pastry was soft, fluffy and moist, with just a nice mix of spinach with the rest of the ingredients. None overpowered the other. And the ceviche was suitably tangy - it immediately whet the appetite for more. So by the time our medium rare rib-eye arrived we were suitably primed to enjoy it. And boy was the bovine divine. Nothing fancy, just the beef itself and a dash of salt sprinkled lightly on top. It was a melt-in-your-mouth experience. This was our first time there tonight, but we'll definitely be back. Oh . . .great service staff, attentive but not too eager. Perfect evening. If you want pictures, visit its website

They have an excellent set lunch for $32. However we were tempted by the steaks on offer. Given we weren't very hungry we shared an excellent beetroot salad - very flavourful and great textures. We also shared a lomo filet - great meat and cooked just right. Definitely worth visiting.

had eaten at their other branch in martin rd, so gave this a try one friday night. we were 3, sat at the bar. chef tried very hard to sell us a steak but we wanted to explore more of the menu so ordered a range of apps and mains. only the tongue was worth the eating; everything else was airplane-food level. so i guess on that count the chef knew what he was doing. could've lived with all that except for this: when i went to the restroom i saw the busboy coming out...without washing his hands. so, bochinche, i can say with confidence: never again

We have been there for the meat, it was really great and fresh (good enough for the picky Brazilian) - served with homemade fries (good enough for the picky Belgian) and chimichurri sauce. Cocktail menu is cool / original, starters and desserts are a must try. I had the crab toast and the spinach empanadas - both amazing. Desserts are great also and if you sit at the counter you can watch the chef as there is an open kitchen. Book in advance

We travel to Argentina on a regular basis and this is the most creative interpretation of the Argentinian style of cooking in the world. The starters were amazing with a new take on proveleta, empanadas and salads. The main dishes were very good but we felt the starters were actually the best part of the meal. Service was excellent and the feel is hip but well done. Overall this is a must in Singapore

As tourists in Singapore, we searched for an Argentine steak restaurant and got Bochinche. Ox Tongue appetizer was tasty and the watermelon salad was ok. However the empanadas were so - so - the insides was ok but the dough covering was too soft. For the main course the grilled octopus was good but the steaks were quite disappointing - certainly not what you would expect from Argentine steaks (we actually had gone to Argentina and tasted the real "lomo" - melts in your mouth literally). The steaks were not served warm (probably left to cool off too long before serving). Also the steaks had too many veins - not what one would expect in terms of quality of an Argentine steak (whose price was quite high). The desserts of creme brulee and sorbet were ok. Overall an average night in what should been an excellent and high quality experience from an Argentina steak place in Singapore

We chose this restaurant at random to be honest as I wanted to take my sister to the Amoy/Club Street district but also have a decent dinner while there. The only seating was available at the kitchen bar, sister not keen initially but definitely warmed to it. My only feedback on seating was that we first sat in front of the wood oven which was too warm for me but the staff were happy to move us further away. Food was excellent, expertly prepared by a team that clearly know their business. Going back there tonight with my husband for his informal birthday dinner and really looking forward to the food :

Went for lunch with a girlfriend. She ordered the lunch set while I went ala carte.Both our starters were quite good, my rasberry sald was fresh but a tad too salty.My friend had the steak for her main which was very good as has been recommended for this place. I ordered the fish of the day which was wel...extremely salty. Something with salt use at tgis restaurant! For someone who has fish and cooks fish all the time, I was quite disappointed with this main. While fish was fresh, the flavors were imbalanced and excess salt made it unenjoyable. We shared few glasses of wine which were decent. Ended with coffee which was good. Paid about 100 per head which is definitely expensive side for options around this area, especially for lunch.It's surely good food however not as spectacular as generally reviewed.

Visited on a Sunday for a late lunch. Was very impressed by the warmth of the service staff. Also tremendously enjoyed the food, especially the refreshing and fresh ceviche. Will be returning soon.

We are working through the Eat Sing Por book and Bochinche is the fifth! However Bochinche stands out not only in the book but also our experience. Staff great, confident and effective, starters really brilliant; great flavour combinations in both the Empanadas and the grilled Melon! Mains were steak done really well tender and cooked with flavour - when we go back we intend to order all the appetisers. Good wine selection as well!! Relaxed, nosey busy atmosphere! G; it's great - try not to think in non-Singapore terms on price though! It's not cheap

Had dinner here a couple of times. Sometimes just us two and some times we took our guests there. Very reliable in quality and nice staff. Loved the bar where you could dine at and look at the preparations by the chef. Will sure go again, just have to walk a little further ;-
4
I like the atmosphere in the new place and service is still as good as it was in the old place. I couldn't help but notice that the steak prices seem to have gone up and for me the value for quality was one of the major selling points for me previously. I still enjoy the menu and I will definitely come back.
5
The provoleta and the bife de chirizo were great...as if I was still in Buenos Aires in 1990. They had a French chef and local staff who were very attentive. The papas, la carne, chimichurri and while they didn't have pancakes de dulce de leche, they had creme brûlée de bananas con dulce de leche...and they were all very good.

Came here today with a colleague for the set lunch, 3 courses at $32++. The starter was an egg mimosa which wasn't that great. We opted for the sirloin steak which was ok but a bit tough. The dessert, however, of frozen yoghurt and raspberries was really very good. But overall room for improvement here. The restaurant was totally full at lunch

First ask the waiter for cocktails. Don't rely on the menue, cocktails are changing every time, always more inventive. We tried two with vodka and gin and both were delicious and originally served in scientific tools. We took 2 empanadas, one with spinach and the other with meat. Empanadas are not really fine food but these were tasty. We had then one dish of ricotta ravioli with pees and a black bone burger served with delicious fries. Wine is affordable and can be served in carafe which is convenient when you are two and don't want to drink too much. In the end the price was faire - about 70-80 sgd each for 2 cocktail, 50 cl of wine, 2 empanadas and 2 main dishes ... For Singapore I think it is fair price. We had diner on the terrace and the atmosphere was really agreeable !

We came on a Tuesday night (it was busy but not crowded) and sat at the outside table, which we recommend because inside seating is very loud. We ordered first cocktails (thumbs up to the Spicy Lolita) empanadas as starters (each order is 1 piece), delicious and not (too) heavy but pricy for what it is.We then had the burger (great and the fries with sauce are amazing) and the sweet peas ravioli (the best of the dinner !). We had some Malbec from the amazing selection and it was just perfect pairing. A good experience and we will come back to try on the meat selection on a hungry night

For meat lovers. You get for what you pay. Yes It is not cheap but meat is awesome and i had a lovely dessert (strawberry with mascarpone) to die for.Only negative for me It is the noise. This place is easily noisy and we can't talk to each other. So we focus more on the kitchen flavours ;=)
5
Ate here on a Wednesday night and was busy with a great atmosphere, the service is first class attentive and friendly with great recommendation on the wine.Food was excellent with the major exception of the steak that was tough, not sure whether it had not been rested enough or whether it was just a bad batch but in future I will avoid it and go for other courses.Still 5 stars but suggest don't go for the steak and enjoy all the other excellent courses
