The price for Steamboat is expensive but ou pay for the service rendered.The food cost you consumed while waiting are all hidden charges in your bill.Nontheless,I admired the owner‘s creativity in delighting their customers.
Waiting time is it intentionally?

We were lucky to book and get straight in. Just totally loved the hot spicy food here. You need to go with a friend or group to reply enjoy it. Good service, great food, try the bullfrog so tender.

Went to the outlet at Bedok Point. Waited for 2 hours for the seats but definitely worth it especially the services by the staff. It was exceptional and good. Food was also good. Never fail to disappoint.

If you have not heard, this restaurant even allow the customers to bring their own food in Taiwan, Shanghai... But not here though. Maybe not yet, but I had a chance to visit it and was totally impressed by it. The service is never like anything you seen anywhere else. For a start, the queue is crazy, but even while waiting, there are tables with free flow snacks and stuff for you to pass time. That is even before paying. I seriously hope people do not abuse it.Once seated, some very fantastic things happened. They give you screen wipe for your phones and tablets as well as a ziplock bag to protect it from splash. My tablet was a bit too big though, but nice try anyway. I hope they have bigger bags in the future. Then when the food are served, you actually do not even need to lift a finger and they will put it into the pot for you, especially those expensive stuff like the prawn paste and meat balls. The cost of the food is on the high side though, to be honest. There is additional charge on the drink freeflow (SGD$3) and if you want to access the saucem puddings and fruits unlimited, its another SGD$4 / person and the soup base is also charagable so you can see that it will exceed $10 easily even before you even start to order food. But the selection is good, there is hot, cold drinks of herbal tea and soya drink which is really smooth. The fruits may varies but we had long gang and various melons to choose from and sauces is so much you can see from the picture I added here.The staffs are really friendly and I had a really good service. They even give you sweet and toothpicks. I would like to give a praise for the staff Wu Ming Li, who served us at Plaza Singapure branch and she had made my dinner really enjoyable and I think I would want to return soon, or even go to their new branches opening soon

Located on the famous entertainment district of Clark Quay. Base soup has many choices from natural to spicy hot soup. I ordered the tomato base soup non spicy and it was yummy and different than usual (must try). It has wide variety of vegetables, meat and condiment, served very fresh. Service was excellent however the price is consider nearly expensive but worth to try. The restaurant capacity is big but most of the time is high occupancy.

This new Plaza Singapura outlet has been open for the last four days.Located on 4F near the escalators - overlooks the main atrium - friendly greeters outside the entrance - offering sample popcorn, interesting banter about the chain, originating from Chengdu in Mainland China.My dining companion and I chose three soup bases, laksa, chicken and spicy.We chose a selection of meat, chicken, beef, seafood and lamb, accompanied by vegetables - the mushrooms were great -- we also had noodles prepared in front of us by a staff member swirling around a piece of dough - very entertaining - the noodled were flat and tasted great.This outlet is worth a visit - we will be back again - thanks to Ellen and Sally for their enthusiastic and friendly service - we appreciated it

Singapore is food – pure and simple. To stand out from that crowded marketplace you’re going to have to offer something pretty unique. And that is just what Hai Di Lao Hot Pot has done. The food is good, but it is not the main attraction. It is the service which really is extraordinary. I almost don’t want to say anything for fear of spoiling the surprise and awe that we felt every time something amazing occurred. Suffice it to say, this is the best service (and “service” is not just limited to friendly efficient waiting staff) that I have seen in many a long year. To say that I loved Hai Di Lao Hot Pot would be an understatement

This outlook is pretty quiet on a Sat afternoon. Hence, there were tables available even though we did not make any reservations. The food was good but what really stood out were the extras in terms of entertainment and services. Highly recommended to try it at least once.

We had no dinner plans when we got to Clarke Quay and stumbled upon this restaurant. Looked like lots of fun so we put our name down and waited about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The Tiger beers are large and sharable. We ordered the half pork bone and half chilli oil sauce(?) Australian beef, beef balls, prawns, veggie platter, mushroom platter, cabbage. Perfect for the two of us. Our server escorted us to make our own sauces for dipping and even made two of the most popular for us to try. It was a bit difficult to get the attention of the server to order more drinks. Good experience and it cost us around $215 Singapore dollars
5
Be sure to bring someone that speaks Chinese because they don't speak English. But amazing hot pot and entertainment.

Very inexperienced or just plain terrible? Could not answer the simplest questions without saying she needed to ask the manager.
Food was just okay and everything just seemed disorganized, including preparing the dipping sauces.
Not sure what else to say really.
5
The outlet that I had tried is at 313 somerset Road. Great food and atmosphere. Great service too. Fabulous concept and you want to keep visiting it again. You get a choice of many side dishes and the condiments are aplenty and wonderful to try. So much variety to choose. Although it is getting expensive but the queue is always so long. Highly recommended

It was our first visit to a Hot Pot Eatery. We went there for Lunch 10 of us in our extended family. Few vegetarians were also accompanying us. A truly amazing experience. The staff helped us order as well as told us how you go about everything in a Hot Pot Place. I would like to mention here specially one staff member Ms. Dephanie
5
always crowded, thankfully we came at 530pm to escape the long queues yesterday. while waiting you are able to help yourself to the free fruits, drinks, manicure, games, etc. food was good as usual, love the tomato based soup for the hotpot. service is back to its good standard, was here a year back and they seem to be struggling with service standards due to the surge in customers. will come back agai

Walked at around 1.30pm on a sunday to the branch at Clarke Quay. Was lucky that we did not have to wait for seats. We also took a queue number to get nails done while we had our food.My favourite dishes are the black pork, shrimp paste, the haidilao noodles. The texture of the noodles is very 'Q' & chewy. The service staff offered us bib and ziplock bag for our cellphone and even screenprotector replacement (only for iphone, how unfair!)By the time we finished our food, the manicurist called me on my cellphone to inform me its my turn. The manicurist that I had that day was skillful and friendly. After we had our nails done. Really good service

Another interesting meal brought directly from Shanghai, this restaurant is one of the most popular places for local people and you may have to end up waiting for over 2-3 hours in the long line. To accommodate the always long queue the restaurant has even free food and drink and free nail coloring service on site while you are waiting!!We love its hotpot, with many soups to choose from including signature chicken soup, ma la Sichuan soup, and many others. A variety of veggies and meats are all of great choice to sooth customers' quest. Don't miss order the noodle for your hotpot and you will be impressed for the show of swirling and flying noodle by a local boy.

This a chain, i actually ate at another location. The restaurant is famous for the service. If you have tonwsit, they serve you a drink with some nibbles and you can even get a manicure...In the restaurant they have tables for four (you can sit with 2 or 3 as well) and in the middle of the table there's the hotpot. You can have between 1 and max 4 different soups. You order many ingredients to boil, a fun activity. Make sure to order noodles, they are prepared at your table, a small show.We spent 40SGD/pp

I dine in at the Harbourfront walk branch. Haidilao is famous with their excellent service, I would like to especially credit to 媚燕 who served me on 大年初一, she is very friendly, attentive and helpful. The hot pot taste very good and authentic though it is really spicy. The raw material served is fresh. I would definitely like to try another soup base on next visit

Wandered in here for dinner when on hols in Singapore - not our best move as we were clueless as to how to make Chinese soup & hot pots and didn't really get much direction from the friendly staff. Busy with locals who seemed to be loving it and the raw ingredients were good & well presented. Kind of like going in to a Wagamama in UK and being presented with a range of ingredients inc herbs/spices/sauces and being invited to make our own meal without guidance - and paying full price for the privilege. Suspect locals might give it 5* for fun sociable meal but not ideal for us !
5
It was our first experience and the 1 hour wait was definitely worth it. We were served like VIPs and I loved how efficient the workers were. Food was scrumptious and I would definitely recommend this place to Asian food lovers. Cheers!

This is the best steamboat I ever have had. Their tomato soup base and mala soup base are the best!! Our favourite items are fish skin(must try!), frozen beancurd, radish(leave it long enough for the radish to soften), prawn paste and the noodle!!
4
Went few times to the branch in 313, Always long q no matter what time. Tidbits are provided while waiting for q. Well known of good service and nice foods. A bit pricey bt worth to go. Tomato soup is my favour! Self services bars provided all kind of spices, some fruits and desserts, but need to pay for sgd4 extra

I'd like to rate 5 stars to this rest as the taste is great and service level is high. However, after 2 years opening, this rest never maintain their facilities. When the air conditioner keeps dropping water, I plan to minus 1 star for the poor maintenance.Chicken soup base is really stunning. It will push you to the climax when you taste it. Of course the price is the highest.Fresh aorta is a must try dish as this is the original ingredient in Szechuan hot pot when people created such dinning style.There are ard 20 various side dishes to enrich the taste with hot pot which you won't find anywhere else.Long waiting time is this rest's Achilles heel! Diners will normally wait 2 hours to get a table even in weekdays.If you're sick of waiting and wasting time by just sitting outside with drinks and snacks. You may travel to Beijing to eat this haidilao hot pot. There are more outlets there and price is much cheaper.Travelers are recommended to taste this flavor is Beijing rather than in singapore

First tried this hot pot chain in shanghai a few years back and it was very good. Was very happy to find this franchise when i visited Singapore. Had to wait for more than 1hr to be seated as the queue was massive even at 10pm at night. But the food selection, the different type of broth and the free tidbits given while you wait for your seats are worth your while
5
Have heard many good reviews from my friends prior to finally trying this personally, and it sure did not disappoint. While the wait for a table was considerably long (can be >30 minutes), they served us snacks while we waited. The food was of great quality, and the service was amazing. It is also not extremely expensive, so it was totally worth it
4
A superb service experience you will have there but the queue is always present. One way to beat the queue is to appoint a "hero" to arrive early and get the number first. They do not accept reservation but if you go early and tell them around what time you will reach, the attendant can help u get a number around that time. This is how good their service is. The famous (or rather what i like) is the tomato soup base
4
I called to reserve for 7pm, i went there waited for 2 hours, went in at 9pm. But the waiting period was interesting. They have tables, free flow drinks and snacks, fruits, games, folding paper crane to get free food. You will not get bored. Free manicure service is there too. Servers are very very attentive, you always serve well and proper. After you go in, you will need to pay for the sides that serve at the bar. Fruits, desserts, cooked food, and ice cream. All are free flow. Steamboat food are ordered ala-carte. Soup base are nice, lot of choices of soup, food are fresh, ramen performance if you order the noodle, a guy will play music and perform ramen in front of you. Impressive experience, but for the waiting time, I might not go there again unless all friends would like to have that

We arrived at 5:43pm, we didn't get a table until 8:13pm. Yes, it's a Saturday, we should have known better.While waiting, we couldn't help but overhear the party beside us that they know manager x. Shortly after, they were seated. A waitress also mistakenly approached us asking if we were friends of manager y. She managed to find the manager's friend and she was seated shortly after that too.They had a display at the entrance meant to show the queue numbers for large and small tables, but somehow, it was not operational.Even when we asked about what the current queue number is, we were referred to different staff before we can get an answer.After waiting for 2.5 hours for our table, we can't help but think that this is not normal. We would have waited without complaints if the system is more transparent. Wished the queue numbers were displayed.The waitress was apologetic and offered us some voucher for a free dish.We enjoyed the food there, but I doubt I would return, knowing that I'll be in for a 2 and half hour wait for a table.PS. They have a no corkage policy

I have been to this restaurant in Shanghai and the good service and food were quite similar to the one in Clarke Quay. Although the price tag is 5 times more expensive in SG, due to SGD/CNY conversion rate. Remember to order the signature lao mian where someone will twist and throw the dough in front of you, highly entertaining. Love the free flow condiments, fruits and dessert counter too.

Visit the shop end of March. They provide free tidbit while you waiting for Q. Interestingly they also set up pedicure me small playground for waiting customer.My strong point to this restaurant is the food and service. I ordered the tomato based soup and it taste good. Something different with other steamboat. Their waitress are very friendly and helpful. To my surprise they also provide plastic bag for us to keep handphone, wet tissue for me to lap my spec , hot tower before and after meal, even apron to avoid soup split to our shirt..:::Thumbs up!

Anyone who loves steamboat will know Hai Di Lao. Everything about the restaurant offers a fantastic dining experience. Be it the freshness of ingredients offered, the variety and type of soup stocks available to the attentive services dispensed by the service staff, Hai Di Lao never fail to deliver. What's also delightful is the wide spread of sauces, appetisers and desserts/ fruit platters offered in a buffet setting. Must tries are :-Mala soup and superior chicken soupPrawn paste and cuttlefish pasteIced tofu cubesBeef and lamb platterThe restaurant is clean with buffet spread nicely laid out. For a place that is always crowded, kudos to the team in maintaining cleanliness all the time

Really impressed by the service. Hadn't been back since the birth of my Daughter, who is now one month old. They didn't have a booth available, but the manager rolled out a baby crib for us. Couldn't believe they had a crib, was a really nice touch and made lunch that much more enjoyable as we didn't have to hold the baby. Kids enjoy the fresh juices and the free ice cream. My Daughter is particularly fond of the fried 馒头 and the sweetened condensed milk. The dumplings tasted particularly good today, everything seems to taste better after an extended absence.

Stopped by around 3pm on Sunday, which was great as there was no wait. Had the spicy hotpot which was really good, right amount of spice with the numbness from the peppers. Menu was decent, though missing items you can find on the menu in China. Sauces were a bit of a miss, what they had was decent but no XO sauce and some of the other specialty sauces you can find in China. Because of this I have to give it a 4.
3
They now have 3 different outlets in Singapore. This is something I eat when I am in China. It is too pricey to eat this in Singapore. Service is tip top but I prefer the taste in China. Remember to add soup all the time or it will become very saltish

We booked 3 weeks in advance as the place is very popular. There is a nice waiting area with manicure and child care area. While you are waiting, they offer drinks, fruit platter and titbits. The staff were very welcoming and inviting. You order via the ipad which is a little annoying as everytime you try and scroll through, it opens the item up and you have to go back. The only annoying thing is that the waitress kept coming up to ask if we had finished ordering even though she could see we were still going through the items. Other than that, the service was amazing. They would check the temperature of the hot pot, top up the soup, they offered to remove the shells of the prawns and the shell fish as well. Provided aprons to prevent splashes on clothes and zip cover for your phone. There is free wifi. We ordered the pulled noodles and the waiter came out to pull the noodle in front of us. It was entertaining. Our friend had a birthday and they came and sung a birthday song as well as provided a fresh plate of fruits. The place was very packed even though it was a Monday night. Have been to a few steamboats but this place definitely is a mark above the rest.Overall, we enjoyed ourselves. We paid about $190 for 4 people.

I heard alot from friends about this HOTPOT place called Haidilao - I must say its really packed but after my experience eating there last nite, I must say the staff service is good, looks interesting as it's truly packed & long Q too.But my opinion of the food is Average .......
5
The restaurant have to booked early and even you already booked, you also have to wait for 1 hours and above. During wating the table, the staff there are very nice, they served you finger food, drink, fruits, and some games for you. While children can play at the small playground and take care by them. The food and service are really good and its worth to pay it. There also have a Ramen cook to perfom in front of your table

Went to their 313 Somerset Outlet.Service: 4.4/5Staff was friendly and ready to take your order "any time".Food: 5/5Fresh, fresh and fresh... and order the Tomato Base Soup (one of their signature soup bases).Overall: 4.5/5One of the best places to have steamboat in Singapor

I went there with 1 adult and 1 child. Their service is simply amazing. As they are quite packed, they have entertainment such as manicure service for ladies and children's playroom, with staff looking after the little ones. In case you are waiting too long, they provide snacks such as pop corn, cherry tomatoes and banana crackers to ease your hunger. The queue there is very long, do try to make reservations before going. Otherwise go there before 6 pm to try for a table. We were quite lucky, we tried making a reservation 1 day before and there is no tables available. But when we head down at 5ish pm, they allowed us in provided we try to finish by 7pm. Regarding the food, everything is nicely plated and the service rendered by the staff is impeccable. They passed us apron to wear before starting so that sauces will not dirty our clothes. They also provide cleaning cloth for your glasses and rubber bands for customers with long hair. Food is fresh and soup is delicious. We order a 鸳鸯锅, the spicy pot is too spicy for us. They have a interesting selection of sauces which you can pick yourself. If you order 拉面, the shifu will make the noodles in front of you. So it was so entertaining to eat there. 2 adults and 1 child cost us about $100.
