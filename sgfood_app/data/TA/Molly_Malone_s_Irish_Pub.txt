Nice little Irish Pub close to Boat Quay. During the day it's quiet. During football world cup it's insane. Worth a visit.

Met up with friends for a drink and supper in an Irish Pub setting. Busy, noisy and bustling - and very enjoyable on a Friday evening. Service nothing special but fish and chips, for which the pub is, apparently, renowned, were very good. Recommended.

Lovely food reasonably priced, great staff and well located. Quiz night and Irish music night both great. Lovely time, lovely people.

I met some friends here and had a great time buying each other some Guinness Beer. There was lots of people here and everyone was happy!
4
Out walking and we decided to stop in for a beer. We had fries on the side which were good. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. The beers were good Irish beers.
5
Best food of our stay. Value for money, great selection,excellent service. Drinks a bit $$ but that's Singapore
4
This is what I call a good pub. The ambience, food and drinks were all very good. This is the type of lace you want to go to with your mates and hang out or if you are into sports and beer. have been coming back 3 times since I discovered this pub

We were looking for somewhere that did bar snacks and happy hour beers. We found this place and it's great. Good location and even has its own toilet, a rarity in this area as most are shared public toilets. We'd had a big lunch so only wanted a snack but made the mistake of ordering two snacks - big portions of wings and a plate of spring rolls and samosas. One would have been enough! All day bucket of beer for $35 SGD so pretty good. This was the only bar that actually told us the happy hour beer prices rather than let us order full price beer! The menu for the meals looked good - English comfort food in abundance. Would visit again

We've dine in over 85 countries and after a long cruise found ourselves in Singapore for about 5 days. We were not pleased with the general small portions and high prices we found around Singapore so were greatly surprised at Molly Malone's. The quality and quantity of food and services was a welcome treat to behold

I go to Molly Malone's for comfort food - when I'm sad, happy, basically any occasion would be a good idea for comfort food! Haven't been here for some time, but not sure if it is just me, but the salt content is a tad high. I quite liked it, because I like salty food, but my friend I was having dinner with brought to my attention that the Chips and the Shepherd's pie was really quite salty. Good: the food is easy to eat, great to catch up with friends over food like this. the beer battered fish and chips was in generous chunks, and is the highlight for me. the shepherd's pie is basically tenderly mashed potatoes on top of minced beef - the potatoes are so smooth you'll feel like you're in heaven. Neutral: I guess it can be a tad too salty, and we didn't get beer to match the saltinessBad: the staff were not available, and the cutlery was given wrongly (think 1 knife and 2 spoons for fish and chips and shepherd's pie). I had to stand up, go get the menu, and do the same for ordering. Quite terrible now that I'm writing it down

If you are already in the area then I would suggest you go somewhere else. No drink specials and no discount for regular customers (plenty of others nearby do). That's enough to tell you to try somewhere else.
4
Came here for lunch. The fish n chips comes in standard as well as mini portions. The fried chicken is really nice.
5
A bit rough around the edges, weird floor plan - great service, fantastic live music downstairs and awesome comedy upstairs.
There s even a worse for wear Molly Malone to pose with.

Ordered the beef burger topped off with an extra fried egg. Came with a thick juicy patty about 3/4" thick, medium-cooked. Delicious!

At $19.40/ pint this is the most expensive average Guinness I have ever had in a pub. The fish in the Fish Chips (which was battered to hell) was suffering from myoliquifaction - turned to mush. Don't bother.

This was by far the worst dining experience in our Singapore holiday. Food was mediocre, service was slow and none of the Irish ambience you would expect from an Irish Pub. Gutted we wasted a dining experience in this place when there are so many fantastic places we could have gone.
4
I wasn't expecting much in terms of food quality since it appeared to be the sort of place one would go for a beer than food. So I was very surprised that they served up a plate of really good beer battered fish & chips and could do a very nice duck confit (not always easy to find, even at places that charge a lot more). Good food at reasonable prices!

We all know that singapore is not a cheap city which is fine, but when you are selling tiger beer at 5$ more than other establishments you wonder what happens to all them extra dollars? They were not spent on luxury fixtures or fittings that's for sure. Anyway lesson learned, won't come back or recommend to anyone. Don't mind paying more if it's justified. .

Our group of 8 visited this place on Friday night St. Patrick's day. The restaurant full of service staffs which all quite attentive. Our Guinness and few buckets of beer came fast. The band that played there on Friday was excellent. One thing I didn't like was a promotional girls from Magners. They came buy and asking my friends if any one of us want a hat. I thought the hat was cute. So, I ordered one Cider while I try to reach out the hat she ignored me and gave the hat to my hubby.. What kind of manner was that? If Magners read this comment training your promotional girls better next time! If not there won't be any order for next special day!

Molly Malones is a fine Irish bar, with nice live music and good fish and chips. It is especially good on St. Patrick's Day. I never had anything to complain about before, until I went in for a beer on a Tuesday evening and was charged $19.40 (12.53 Euro/13.80 USD) for a very poor pint of Heineken. You expect higher prices for alcohol in Singapore and even a little bit more in a theme bar, but this is a ridiculous price to pay for a pint of Heineken by anyone's standards
4
We all standing here right now.. Dancing and drinking.
The band tonight is very good. The singer and guitar player both are excellent.
5
Our daughter said we have to visit this Pub where she often goes. We had one of the best steak dish.. cooked to perfection and tasty too
4
The location of this pub, especially the one near Esplanade is fantastic. The menu is minimalistic. The music and ambience is good. Not that heavy on the wallet as well.
4
Nice little pub, sometimes they have live music. I like the vibe here, it's cool. Surprisingly this Irish pub has really good satay, give it a try. Good range of ciders and beers.
5
Very friendly and busy Irish bar . Staff all very helpful and pleasant .
Sad to say but with all the varied food on offer I went for the Irish breakfast , glad I did mind it was excellent.
4
A short walk from the tourist hot spot of Clarkes Quay and much cheaper drinks too. A good choice of beers with seating available both inside and out. A pub menu with all the usual favourites available. Worth the walk if you like the Irish pub franchise look seen around the world

After my meeting in town, we headed to this place for a quick drink and chillout, before we headed home. It was a Tuesday, so the place wasn’t packed. We sat along the pedestrian walkway, next to the road, which allowed us to drink under the stars and also admire the views of the CBD skyline – especially the towering UOB Building.I ordered the Guinness Stout on draught. Loved the fresh taste unlike from the can/ bottle. Happy hour prices was $13/ glass. I had two glasses.They also have finger food such as satay that you can also order to go with your drinks

I visited Molly Malone's this afternoon for lunch. Tried their lunch special (Salmon) and it was perfectly seasoned, flaky and pretty fresh. I loved their chips which I ordered with my fish. The iced tea was unsweetened (just the way I like it) and made from tea bags. Very nice little place! I will visit again someday

Unfortunately the place that I really wanted to have a drink at (on the recommendation of the internet) was closed so since I walked past this place I decided to duck in for a drink. I must admit that it wasn't really all that fantastic. It certainly wasn't the cheapest place for a drink, and the atmosphere was not the best. Okay, it was fairly quite, and the staff were reasonably good, and they did have some decent beers on tap, but other than that it wasn't really all that fantastic. While they do show live Aussie Rules football matches, there are much better places to go to if you want for fix of Australian sport

I had visited Molly Malone's before and had a great experience, so I thought I would try it again as I passed through Singapore. This time I went for their set lunch - fantastic steak with a soup starter for $15 (believe me, that is cheap in that part of town). Guinness was, dare I say it, better than last time, and the service was much improved. The General Manager had a chat with me, and apparently this year is their twentieth anniversary, which is not surprising with the quality on show. Premises could do with a lick of paint, but it's all part of the charm

Visited here for lunch, fish and chips was decent and they have live premier league games. It's a popular spot for ex-pats to drink after work but is pretty quiet during the day.

Just another bar selling Guiness
It's in a good location on Circular Road, just behind Boat Quay
I was a bit gobsmacked when half a lager cost the equivalent of £5....
4
With my friends we came here the food was great and drinks also were on pont. Everyone was like we should come for breakfast lunch and evening drink
4
It`s a must when walking the circular road to its end to drop in for a final pint of Guiness. The music on weekends is nice and firts the atmosphere. It`s just another Irish pub but stylish and well located.
4
This restaurant is located behind the boat quay and is decorated in a traditional irish pub style. We had a few pints of kilkenny which was served well and enjoyed the blues singer who came on about 10PM...
5
Has Friday evening drinks. Great beer and a nice crowd. Good music with a Celtic flavor. Great location and atmosphere.

I visited on June 10,2015. We ordered Haddock and burger. My Haddock was very dried and flavorless. The burger was so so. Last time a few of friends had a Shepard's pies and they're said excellent. So, my recommended food to order in this place is Shepard's pie :)
5
Good food and good beer make Molly Malone's a great place to relax just away from the gauntlet that is Boat Quay. Get the MRT to Raffle's place an take exit G to get there quickly. Nice friendly staff and good music that is not played too loud

The beef and Guinness pie is simply heavenly, and this is without a doubt the best Guinness I have had in Asia - apparently it is actually imported from Ireland rather than brewed under license. However, my review of the excellent food and drink here was almost tempered by what I first perceived as slow service, until I chanced upon being introduced to the manager, Alex. When I expressed my opinions he was incredibly apologetic and took the time to explain the logistics of the bar (it is an old style one with many nooks and crannies, and poor sight lines from the bar, making it a difficult one for staff to get around - especially when they are short-staffed) and the restrictions on hiring staff in Singapore (many Singaporeans won't work in the industry and quotas are imposed on hiring foreign staff, causing staffing problems for many bars). After this conversation I sat back and watched the staff, who were clearly stretched very thin but were working very hard and still managing to be engaging and friendly with customers. It gave me a new appreciation of what these guys go through. Well done guys, keep up the good work

Molly Malone's is located on Boat Quay, and has been there forever, or at least since 1997 when I first started visiting Singapore. It has moved locations, had renovations and changed ownership during this time. It serves wonderfully cold and fresh Guinness. When I recently visited the place was looking a little tired and the service could have been better
