Despite some of the other reviews, I think this dessert was very tasty. It isn't too sweet, but is just sweet enough. We ordered the mango bingsu. You have to eat through all the layers to really enjoy it.

The size is too big for one person, I ordered cheese injeolmi toast and injeolmi bingsu, pretty good, not too sweet, which is just perfect for me.

We ordered the deluxe chocolate bingsu. SGD 20.25. A chocolate party indeed. The good thing about it is that it's not so sweet. This is big enough to share among the two of us.
Overall I'm satisfied.

Ended up at the bugis store and got the $18.90 black sesame. Whilst it was good I can't justify the price, especially when I could have paid $2.50 for a nice ice cendol around the corner.
So it is nice but be prepared to pay.

Here's some toy food for you to enjoy during summer.It's basically ice and milk and sugar, dressed with something else at your choice.Caramel cafe is fair. It comes sweet, like everything else.It wasn't that busy but felt like a nice spot to take your time and relax, especially outdoors. Not too many tables available but the ones that were free needed cleaning.I'm not planning on going back

Went to Nunsongyee with my relatives after shopping for the entire day.The place is quite huge. There is an outdoor and three level of seating area in the building.They also offer a free wifi.For the bingsoo, we ordered the cheesecake with digestive biscuit crumble, Sesame seeds with azuki (japanese red beans) and mango.It tastes not too sweet, with a scoop of vanila ice cream, a little bit of sauce and creamer.You can fill the creamer as much as you like as they provide a bottle of creamer on the table.Well, honestly speaking, my cousins not really into it as they prefer the bingsoo to be sweeter, but I am ok with it.I just feel the mango is not sweet enough and i do not feel any guilty after eating this bing soo, because of the lack of sugar. Lol..

I shared the pat bingsu ($12.90) with my mum after passing by this place several times. Bingsu was the craze of Singapore a few months back, and new places selling Korean food seem to keep opening everywhere I go! I liked the taste of the pat bingsu - it was mildly sweet and very cooling. Many options of dessert to choose from. Very refreshing in the hot weather! Quite nice, albeit pricey

Went there for dessert after dinner. Just ordered the cheesecake bingsu and Oreo bingsu. Generous amount of Oreo powder was poured over the shaved ice. The shaved ice was real soft and melts in the mouth. The cheesecake bingsu comes with slices of cheesecake and butterscotch ice cream on top. The restaurant does not provide free cold water like other Korean restaurant.

Went to the branch at Chun Tin Road. Between the four of us, we ordered the Black sesame bingsu, Injeolmi toast, Honey butter toast, Oreo bingsu. Taste-wise, the Honey butter toast was worth ordering. Price-wise, none of them were worth it. Extremely over-priced. The ice is not as delicious as the one I had at another bingsu place. The other place had bingsus half the price of the one at Nunsongyee but tasted even better and had bigger portions. Overall, I will not recommend it

Friends brought me here after dinner at OFC opposite. We ordered one premium bingsu. OMG! It's $18!!! It's just ice! Hahahahaha... Naturally, we will draw parallel comparisons with ice kacang. Overall, it is nice. Not too sweet n not too bland. Will we return? Hmmm... Once a while, I guess is okie. But not on a regular basis. It's another fad.

Had the injeolmi bingsu. Expensive and disappointing. I don't think it's worth the money and I believe I would rather eat ice kachang in a hawker centre

Tampines Century Square level 2
Didn't realize there's one at CS. First time trying the dessert here. Ordered the Chef's Recommendation - injeolmi toast (weekday afternoon comes with a free drink).
Also the cheesecake bingsu. Good for 2. :)

Doesn't look as good as it taste...they opened a 2nd branch at upper Thomson road where I tried. Overly priced especially the sweet ttheobokki. 4 miserable SMALL pieces that tasted wired. I looked around and found most tables left unfinished.

My 10 year old was the one who wanted to have Bingsu so we went to Nunsongyee near Bugis Junction. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they have an "ice room" and she proceeded to make an ice man.1 Bingsu between 3 To adults was more than sufficient. I thought it was rather on the sweet side. Definitely place the go for the sweet tooth.The toilet however could be cleaner and the table although looked clean and spotless was a bit sticky.I gave 4 stars as my daughter really enjoyed it

We came after dinner & it was about full but not packed as previous visit .We ordered the Choco Banana & Black Sesame Bingsu. Tasted nice as before. But still not the best we have tried so far. What we really love about this place is the simple, yet cosy & 'homely' ambience. Being housed in a 3-storeys shophouse further enhances that 'homely' ambience . Gives one a relaxed, no rushed feeling. Great for slowly enjoying expensive desserts like Bingsu.

The outlet takes over the space of the well known Ritz Apple Strudel store. The branch is the 3rd outlet after Burghley Drive and Tanjong Katong. The outlet has 3 floors of dine in area, as well as, alfresco dine area. The washroom is at the second level. Those with kids would prefer the second level which has finely shaved ice to play with. The outlet is open 24 hours and there is free wifi available.After placing order at the first floor counter, one would be given a pagar, which will light up when the food is ready for collection at the first floor.Pat Bingsu ($12.90)The shaved ice had a very finely texture which simply melt in the mouth. It did not taste too sweet. I like the crunchy fragrant toasted almond slices. If you prefer a sweeter taste, there is syrup at the counter to help yourself to. I like that there was a layer of soya bean powder in the shaved ice

We arrived at 3am plus at the bugis outlet and ordered the coffee bingsu, black sesame bingsu and honey butter toast. It was my second visit and I noted how fast the bingsu melted just within minutes as compared to my previous visit. The honey butter toast was nonetheless delicious with it's sweet fillings and crusty exterior. The bill came up to $50, pricey but given we had the entire second floor to ourselves and at such wee hours, it was still a good experience

Ok, so one ice cream can cost like SGD12,up to a premium selection of SGD18.Granted, the portions are huge, but I think the attempt to have fusion mix of tastes have come up to ridiculous tasting flavours that include cheese mixed in simply wrong concoctions.I think it is trying too hard, and I am not quite keen to go back to splurge on something that doesnt quite fit mine and many of my friends' tastebuds, as well as contribute to a highly likelihood of diabetes

Hands down! One of my favorite dessert. This shaved-ice korean dessert is really delicious. So far my favorite is the Blueberry Bingsu. With blueberry toppings, vanilla ice cream, cheesecake bits, condensed milk and red bean paste underneath all the goodness, heaven! Oh and their French toast was really good too

I just came from your Bugis outlet today at 1:30am with my friends. I know its already midnight but the girl staff who attended to us was by far the rudest staff ever! She looked at us with disgust and she kept rolling her eyes and answer our questions like "may I know your wifi password" with a "duh" expression. She cannot even look at us and just continued to stand there miserably like she cannot take a minute of her work there. Mind you, that its not busy at all since its already midnight and she really didn't have anything to do. When its our time to pick up our bingsu's, I asked for extra spoon. She rolled her eyes again and talked without facing me "spoon upstairs". So I told her nicely that next time look at us as we are her customers. She then glared at me like she was about to explode. Then when we went up the wifi was not working. The problem is I think your girl staff is very confident that she can do whatever she wants since she is alone. Even discriminate customers. Way to go ruining our night
