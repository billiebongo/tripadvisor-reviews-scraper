Our family of 6 came here for dinner. There is a great variety of condiments to go with the porridge. You can choose to have porridge or rice. Especially love the cockles and braised pig intestines. Good old comfort food for sure.The total bill for 6 pax with drinks and 9 small dishes with porridge came up to $49.00

For less than $7 per head, you could choose from more than 30 dishes to go with your rice or porridge. From vegetables, fried crispy fish, chi poh omelette, minced pork, braised duck, fish cake, squid, plus countless array of traditional dishes from black bean dace fish, all sorts of beancurd: tofu, tau pok, tau kee, to salted egg/fish and the works. PS be prepared to queue during peak dinner hours during the weekends. However the line is moving rather fast

Chanced upon this "Pick and choose" porridge, rice street side restaurant and wasn't disappointed with my meal. Was at 3am between shifts and caught a meal with an assortment of meat and veggies, with a bowl of white watery congee. This is not English sweet porridge but more coolie starchy soup. Like a tapas of small plates of different dishes. It was nice to dine street side on an old-styled coffee-shop marble table and right under the night sky. Will be back for another midnight chow. Retro food, simple and satisfying
