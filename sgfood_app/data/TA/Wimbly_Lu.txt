Loved the location in a residential district and the laid back atmosphere. Quality of the food was good and the staff pleasant. Prices very reasonable too.
5
The dessert that I had was properly prepared and a great value for the price.....love it all....surely be back!!!
5
Food was lovely, we found that this was great value for money. Singapore in general was expensive but this little gem was brilliant. We shared a cheesecake which was delicious.
4
A hidden café deep in the private house area. Wasn't easy access by public transport.
Their root beer float cake is to die for, and of course the waffles! Do arrive early to avoid long Q.
4
Had their carbonara bacon spaghetti and waffle with rum and raisins and salted caramel ice cream. I should say the waffle and ice cream was amazing. Will want to return and try their breakfast some day.
4
My 4th visit and food is consistently well above average for a cafe. Was a busy Saturday night but service still good with some nice touches e.g. chilled glass for beer. Chicken bolognese spaghetti is excellent with pasta cooked al dente. Smoked salmon & cheese crepe was only OK. The cakes are outstandingly good. Reasonable prices. I will definitely be back if these standards are maintained
4
Was there with colleagues for a chill out session. We ordered different things and for myself, i had the Waffles and it is legit good. Not too soft and the texture is really good. Overall the only two things I find need to improve will be the Staff's service and also the plastic glass which they used to hold the Root Beer Float Cake. It's high time to replace a new batch of those glasses as you can see the obvious signs of wear & tear of it. Overall was a good experience with colleagues.To my colleagues if you are seeing this, "Ya". (Inside joke

I spent childhood years in this estate and this row of shophouses used to be old trading companies or mini mart. Great to see it having some restaurants and cafe now. Wimbly Lu serves wonderful pastries, they're huge on chocolate stuff and do it well. Scones were classic but I'm disappointed it came with butter and not cream, and a nondescript strawberry jam. Otherwise everything else was great, including the coffee and chai latte, and the quirky seats which were all different! We will be back for more.
3
Went there for its desserts as its raffles once rated as top 5 must try from some website, It is nice but not the best that I tried. The ice cream are normal. They seems famous for the chocolate stuff so i tried chocolate pie, that is nice
5
Cool little place, great for breakfast. We had a variety of egg dishes in the 2 days were were in for breakfast and they all hit the spot. Egg and bacon crepes were a new thing for me and very nice too! Coffee was good as well
3
Quite a nice atmosphere, European Contemporary. Breakfast (Bacon and Eggs) was ok but not brilliant. Had a funny 'local twist'.
Would come back but not for a special occasion. Good as a 'local'.
5
Went with a few friends. Surprised to find such a nice cosy place. We had waffles and cakes and I like it though the price is a little high. One of the waiters there is very friendly and has good recommendations.
4
This cafe is hidden inside those bungalow houses near to serangoon nex. Walking is reachable but recommended to drive, however carpark lots are limited. The cafe is crowded and you will have to queue up and wait for a table. The waitress will give you a menu to decide what you want to order before your seated. We have ordered a root beer cake and a waffles with ice cream. The food is served fast, however the root beer cake is a bit too sweet for me but the chocolate ice cream with waffle is good, taste is just right and not so sweet. Price is not expensive and will definitely be back to try on its other food
4
Had a freshly baked molten chocolate lava cake. Pretty young and hippy crowd. Location of this place is not exactly accessible without your own transport. Yet large crowds even on a Monday (albeit public holiday). Cake was reasonably tasty. Chamomile tea had a nice flavour that added to cleanse the taste buds after such a rich dessert. Believe there are few more nicer molten lava cake, but at $6 for the cake and $3 for the ice cream scoop, I think it's still good value for money. Other stuff tried before was the lemon meringue pie which wasn't too shoddy.
5
Cosy little cafe caught me by surprise. Service was exeptional the moment I walked through the door. My appetizer, mains and dessert blew me away. Aglio olio bacon + their homemade ice cream is a must try. Am in a food coma as I write this review now. Very reasonably priced too. 100% recommended
4
Lovely ambiance and great food - the coffee and hot chocolate are really nice. So are the desserts. They also have some good options for finger food - hash browns, chicken nuggets etc. The lighting and music exude warmth and add vibrancy to the environment. There is a nice clean washroom too, a rare feature in cafes. The place is a mere 10-min walk from Lorong Chuan MRT
5
We had heard about the wonderful desserts here but have not been able to get a table during previous visits. This time, the helpful and friendly staff managed to get us seated within 15 minutes to our delight. We had just finished dinner next door at La Pizzaiola but the desserts here made it worth a stopover. We tried the molten lava cake with home-made vanilla ice cream, sticky date pudding, carrot cake and tiramisu. All were excellent and priced reasonably between $4 to $7. No wonder it's so hard to get a table any night of the week! Next time, we will go for dinner too
4
We came here after dinner for dessert as we did not know earlier that they also served food. The desserts were very good with a very wide selection and they were not too sweet which made it even more enjoyable. Service staff were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere here is really good. Will be back again to try the food items and definitely for the desserts.
4
Don't get me wrong, this restaurant serves good food, and looks the part too!It will definitely attract those who loves the "brown table series" or "brick wall series" kind of Instagrammers. The place just looks fantastically Instagrammable. To add on, there is a glass panel where the sunshade is which allows for lots of natural light to beautify your food photos.Back to the food though! Went there for desserts and have heard of the service of the place before. Reviews were pretty mixed but I didn't experience any unpleasantness during my visit. Ordered the Chai tea latte and chocolate lava cake and ice cream for the wife. Both dishes were good and it was not overwhelmingly sweet. However, it did not have the wow factor that will make me return anytime soon
5
Went recently to have some dessert after reading other reviews on this site and decided to try it out! Went with a group of 7, finding seats were hard because the place was quite cramped. Ice-cream was very good and rich. I had two scoops, the truffle chocolate and pistachios. Both were amazing but I loved the pistachios one with the generous amount of nuts in each scoop, it's worth the premium price! Head down, enjoy a cup of tea or coffee and maybe a waffle or pancake! Will return!
5
This place is great. It is our local. Pretty cosy. Nice slices of cake n pie etc. The varieties of cheesecake are probably my favourite.
5
Visited during noon to try out their waffles and ice cream with a friend. Was totally worth my visit. Staffs were all friendly are welcoming. Food were affordable and everything was smooth. Highly recommended!
4
This is probably one of the best cafes due to many factors. 1) Location. It's far away from the busy city and busy people. Hidden in a quiet neighborhood, it's a wonderful place for a catch-up or a first-date. 2) It has the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. Granted Wimbly doesn't have that many of a variety as compared to an ice-cream parlor or hipster cafes but the vanilla is to die for. 3) The waffles, crepe and pancakes are on point. The size of the pancake could do some upgrading given the price you pay. 4. Decor. The interior design of Wimbly is certainly magazine-worthy. 5) Besides the standard menu of a cafe, I love that Wimbly serves an array of cakes, pies and desserts. Their carrot cake and blackout cake are one of my favs.I would give in a 4.5 only because of the pancakes. Otherwise, it's perfect. I even dreamt that I went to Wimbly and spent $100. Not kidding
5
I live just down the road from Wimbly Lu's and frequent whenever friends come over to visit. Love the green tea latte, waffles with ice cream, and brownies! It can get quite crowded on weekends so make sure to arrive early or try early evening (5+pm) when you are more likely to get a seat
4
Visited this place with a girlfriend on a weekday in May. We just finished our lunch at Siam Society and made a point to save some space for dessert next door.There weren't as many people maybe because it is a weekday. We were seated under the glass ceiling which is perfect as I love the natural light that comes in.. It is also good that the weather is not as hot.Food wise, the waffles were surprisingly crispy and nice. Hot waffles and ice cream is hard to go wrong. Coffee is good too.The staff were friendly as they greeted us with smiles all the way from when we first step into the cafe till we left.I will definitely be back if I am around the neighborhood. I am not sure if I will make a special trip down just for the waffles.. It is good but not wow enough to warrant a dedicated visit.
5
The waffles are awesome ! I usually top it up with rum and raisin ice-cream. The truffle fries are worth a mention too. I like its quaint ambience in the mid afternoon on weekdays. Weekends are really crowded though and I usually avoid this peak period because it can be quite cramped and stuffy
3
After having our dinner at Siam Society, my boyfriend and I headed over Wimbly Lu for some dessert as we saw some positive online reviews about their waffles. Their waffles are kinda more towards soft and chewy type. If you are a fan of soft and chewy waffles, this place might be a good choice for you! Prices are at a reasonable range too
4
Visited on Friday about 2.00pm. Managed to find a place to park my car. I was told this place can be very crowded in the evening and weekend and parking may be a problem. I enjoyed my tea break - lemon cheesecake and camomile tea. This is an old shop house turned cafe so it retains some charm. There's sunlight nearer the back of the cafe but it's still cool where I sat with the air conditioning and ceiling fan. There's nice music in the background and you could fall asleep on a lazy afternoon
5
I chanced upon this quaint place, hidden inside a cluster of homes. Being a waffle lover, I am always game to discover new waffles joints.This place is a one-of-its-kind. A small place, it speaks of the owner's creativity and passion. The service staff were always smiling and helpful, a welcome experience in Singapore. Our server even offered to refill the peppermint tea pot and get an extra cup for my friend.They serve western food as well. So, you could make it a proper restaurant outing.I ordered the Crepes and Waffles, sans ice cream. Both were near perfect. I must compliment the waffle though. Made to perfection, it was evenly brown. Crispy on the outside and soft enough on the inside.I will surely be back to this place. Maybe, even make it my favourite waffle place
3
The food is good, but not amazing. Its a nice little cafe, quite busy. they bake everything in house (but the cake we had wasn't particularly fresh). The coffee was just ok. Disappointing, if the coffee was better I'd give it a much better review. The dessert was ok too. I will head back and try their breakfast soon though. Good location
4
Forget about dining here as the food is not fantastic but this cosy place hidden in a private housing estate is perfect for their chocolates, cakes and desserts.
5
We were surprised that there is a little cafe hidden within the private estate. We came at our friend's recommendation and we were delighted with this discovery. If you love desserts or anything chocolate, then this is a place worth coming back to. :)
4
Totally love the root beer cake here. It's a 1-person serving so dun order n share if u really like root beer :D
The waffles here r nice n crispy too tho they may take a while
4
A nice place to chill out with friends. They have many variety of cakes and it taste good. Would recommend their Rootbeer cake, it feel like u are eating Rootbeer instead of drinking.
4
The road name sounded familiar when my friend told me about it. Turned out this is close to where I stayed as a kid and I used to cycle there. The whole place have changed over the last 30 years and this place has transformed into a nice little private enclave of cafes and restaurants amidst landed houses. It is nice, private and quiet. We were surprised to find that the cafe was quite full. The ambience is great and the chairs very comfortable for chilling out and long chats. The service was great too. It is decently priced, compared to other enclaves like these in private estates.
3
This is my 2nd visit to this place. The first time, I sat in the front side of the cafe and it was okay. The waffle was good but Ice cream could be more.The 2nd visit, we only managed to secure a seat right outside the kitchen and it was terrible. The smoke was so bad that my friends and I were tearing up. I do hope better ventilation system will put in place to make the cafe more cosy. One thing that is good is that we can share a pot of tea that is water refillable
1
I came with my six year old daughter for a bite to eat. My daughter asked for mayonnaise and they said they do have it but won't serve it with the dish we were having (chicken nuggets and fries). They will only serve it with cheesy fries First time I have ever been refused a condiment by a restaurant, amazed at the lack of desire to serve a customer
5
This is an excellent place for breakfast, lunch or cakes, coffee and dessert. Everything is homemade, even their ice cream, and there are also some larger options for a light dinner. The staff are friendly and the cafe is very ambient. It gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights and you may need to line up for a table. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from Lorong Chuan MRT or 15 minute walk from Serangoon MRT. 5-10 minute walk from bus 58/105
4
I like the ambience of the place, although it can get a little noisy during peak hours. Of the different desserts I tried, I think the sticky date pudding is the best! A must have.The cafe is a little inaccessible, so you will need to drive or take a cab in
3
I have heard about Wimbly Lu for sometime, but haven't had the chance to try it out. This day, I finally did get to come here for dinner. Offering a cosy ambience with a large, spacious main foyer leading into a narrower alley of seats, Wimbly Lu with its brick walls and glittery lights does exude a quasi Old-World charm of its own. Service was a little lackluster because it was hard to get the crew's attention, but other than that, the cafe was rather lovely to begin with.We took a seat at the back, a newfound friend, *Justin and I. Drinks came first. There was the Iced Chocolate with Baileys (SGD$12.00) exuding the richness of sweet alcohol throughout a dense layer of rather-diluted chocolate drink.I had the Seafood Baked Rice (SGD$12.00) because I heard raves about it. The thick coating of cheese and softness of the rice was what lent credence to the otherwise rather bland dish. The seafood comprised merely of a few shrimps merely - or at least that was all I tasted amongst the baked concoction.For desserts, I had the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Salted Caramel Sauce (SGD$6.00) - a very rich slab of sticky, solid chocolate that clung to the insides of the mouth where it melted slowly into a delicious sweetness, like gold caressing the palate in a mellow fashion. The salted caramel sauce was diluted and weak in flavor though, and we didn't think it went well with the thick chocolate dessert.*Justin had the famous Waffles (SGD$6.00) served with maple syrup and butter. They were fluffy, crispy and melted in the mouth, exactly like the way good waffles should be, the kind we imagine slapping a large scoop of ice-cream onto. It stayed crispy even after dousing maple syrup over it, and was not too sweet overall.For full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/09/dinner-at-wimbly-lu-cafe-serangoon.htm

Found this by chance after lunch nearby. The eclair is nice, not too sweet. Nutella cake doesn't taste strongly of Nutella, more chocolatey. Chai latte smells and taste good.
5
This place is very nice...nice ambience, nice food, nice people...
The only part not so nice are...the place is too small. So you need to queue during peak hours...and the tables are cramped...
Love the waffles with caramel ice cream!
5
Always long queue so we decided to try it. All the dessert we tried were very nice. Definitely come again to try other items!
4
Looking for a good hidden cafe for cakes, desserts of coffee, you can check out Wimbly Lu, located at Jalan Riang.Located off Braddel Road, it sits in a row of shophouses, right n the middle of a landed residential estate.They offer several signature desserts, including a cake and ice-cream served in a martini glass!A nice place to chill with friends over a cuppa or two
3
A very cosy cafe, though relatively small. Staff was attentive and we were pleased that we got a seat immediately after we walked in.Ordered a waffle with Honey Cinnamon ice cream (the highly raved) and a root beer cake with ice cream and a elderflower & lime cider. Our desserts and drinks came faster than we expected. The root beer cake w/ vanilla ice cream was really ordinary, nothing too fancy. The Honey Cinnamon ice cream that came with the waffle was amazing though! THowever, we reckon that it would be a tad too pricey for what its worth. Would recommend my friends who haven't come before but would possibly consider twice in coming back.Nevertheless, the staff was friendly and on the job
3
Went there a few times at night, but couldn't get a seat. So we decided to go for breakfast instead. Reached at 9.30am, it was already quite packed inside, was given a table just in front of the toilet. Had waffles and crepe. A root beer float and a cafe latte. The overall experience was ok, I wouldn't say 'fantastic'. Service was prompt. However, if you need salt and pepper, you need to wave for the service. Moreover, they do not serve ice water. It's air-conditioned and you'll (your hair and clothes) smell like toast and oil when you leave.A bit over-rated, I don't understand the long queue in the evenings
4
We needed a nice cup of tea after a bad dinner. Wimbly Lu is a small nice cafe that is very popular. There was a queue but we got a table in 10mins. The tables were very closed to each other but there was a buzzing atmosphere in the air. We had earl grey tea with blackout cake and chocolate truffles. It was heavenly. Great company and lovely tea. Be prepared to wait for a table. :
5
One of my favourite cafes in Singapore. Cafe is located around private houses so might be a little inaccessible. I did take the bus on a few occasions and it is a 10-15 min walk from bus stop to the cafe. Really nice ambiance but it is slightly small. During peak hours, you gotta queue and can get quite cramped as the table next to you may be less than an arm's length away. Best time to visit is probably on Weekday afternoons.The best part of this place is the fooooooood. Their desserts are reasonably priced and taste really really good. If you love salted caramel (like i do) or even if you dont, the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel sauce is the bomb. All their desserts are really delicious and their customer service is good. However, their matcha green tea isnt that nice though; you may want to give it a pass. Will definitely return to try the other items on the menu! Great hang out place
4
even though the cafe is located deep within the private houses estate (inaccessible), I still love this cafe because of the following reasons: great dessert (lemon meringue pie and the waffle) and nice coffee. most importantly is the environment! very cozy! great place to chill out on a lazy weekend afternoon
3
I was there for a quick dessert and tea. The place is really cosy, looks like someone's livingroom. I was seated at the back of the shop near the kitchen, and left smelling like food (not baked goods). The chocolate eclair I had was decent, nothing special. The chocolate shell was good, the choux pastry a little flavorless, the pastry cream filling rich and not too sweet. The matcha (green tea) latte was excellent
4
Love the latte and waffles . We had a second round of waffles . It's just the right texture, soft and light yet crispy. Next time will try the lemon cake :)
3
Went there after my dinner nearby, acceptable if its not overly hyped. Their root beer cake with ice cream as not too bad. Come back again? Maybe,, if the waitresses are more attentive to customers. Oh, should do something to the ventilation too.
3
Until now, I still do not know why this place is so popular. Ironically, the desserts did not impress even though Wimbly Lu is famous for them. The Hazelnut Butterscotch Blondie ($4.50) was too dry and chalky with rancid untoasted nuts though the butterscotch sauce was rich and sweet. I don't understand the logic of molten lava cakes $6without ice cream or creme anglaise sauce but I know some do. The version here is very rich, dense and luckily not too sweet. However, the cake texture was still dry as compared to Domino's or Morgansfield. The Chocolate Tofu Cake $6 did not taste anything of tofu but I guessed the ingredient blended into the mousse did help to give it a smooth, creamy texture. However, the biscuit base was stale and not crunchy as described by the staff. With a crisp texture and some even noted a resemblance with cereal taste, the signature waffles with one scoop ice cream ($8.50) was the better ones that day. I wonder if the salted caramel ice cream came from Salted Caramel at Upp Thomson though. But it was too small a scoop for the size of the waffles. Mediocre Cheese Toast Melts which can be skipped Another recommended item was the Chocolate Root Beer Cake $6. Think layers of root-beer-infused ganache intersecting with chocolate sponge. I like chocolate and root beer. But the combination of both tasted strange. Blackout Cake $6 Bottomline, a cafe that is simply over-rated. Perhaps it is crowded because the seats are limited. My companions were generous to comment that the ambience was good, for instance the settings such as the red bricks tiled wall and lightings. But I tend to ignore ambience and focus on the food. Given the substandard quality of the chocolate desserts, I would not fancy a retur

Decided to cafe hopped with the homz which led us to Wimbly Lu as the last stop. Located at Jalan Riang, it's a little inconvenient to go by public transport, around 10-15 minutes walk from Nex, Serangoon. It's a little cafe popular for its desserts and chocolates and is hidden in a private estate near Serangoon. We were spoilt from choices. There were a huge selection of chocolate desserts to choose from. Prices are still friendly ranging from $6 -$7. Decided to try their highly raved Root Beer Cake. It's a moist cake with a tinge of root beer at the bottom. Something interesting! Wimbly Lu is definitely worth a visit for the desserts if you're near the vicinity. All of their desserts are really worth trying but personally, the Sticky Date Pudding is still my favourite at Wimbly Lu. Must Try! This is my 4th visit to Wimbly lu and wish to try everything on their menu! :D Read more here at, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/08/wimbly-lu-chocolate-cafe-singapore.htm

Adorable cafe with great desserts. The atmosphere was lovely and it was a lovely touch that all the plates was different giving it a homely feeling. The ceilings were decorated with cute clouds giving it a very relaxed ambience. To avoid long queues I suggest going earlier so that you have ample time. I went with a group of friends and we got there around 8.30pm and it was filling up fast despite being a weekday. The molten lava cake was amazing as was the Brownie flavoured ice-cream. Also definitely recommend the Marshmallow pie! That said, because it started getting a little too crowded the staff tried to hurry us along. Overall a nice place to visit and as it's located in a housing area, it was a quiet break from the hustle and bustle of traffic

For full review and pictures, visit: www.GrumblingStomachs.wordpress.comSo a few weeks ago, we visited the cafe called Wimbly Lu which we’ve heard many good reviews about. Wimbly Lu is tucked inside a rather quiet and peaceful private housing estate, and if you don’t know the address and aren’t armed with the handy Google Maps, you probably can’t find it. Together with an old friend K, the three of us ordered the Root Beer cake, Chocolate Lava cake and waffles with salted caramel ice cream to share.Personally I dislike root beer and was rather apprehensive about the Root Beer cake. I mean, root beer tastes and smells like medicated oil! How strange would a root beer cake be! Of course, supporters of root beer, would disagree with me. But anyway, being an adventurous girl, I still took a bite of the cake, and I was speechless. Unfortunately, not because it pleasantly surprised me, but because it absolutely tasted like what I imagined it to be.. a medicated oil cake. Besides, there was this strange sour aftertaste that made it rather unpleasant. I figured it must have been the amount of flour added in during the making of the cake. Next came the Chocolate Lava Cake, and it looked sooooo appetizing. The top of the cake is slightly cracked, giving a glimpse of the molten chocolate that is threatening to ooze out from the cake. We took a first bite and got a foodgasm. Yes it’s so good, being chocolate-lovers, we just couldn’t resist it. The top of the cake was baked to a perfect hardness, and together with the moist centre and oozing melted chocolate, it was perfect. To me chocolate lava cake is an interesting dessert, its first bite can never go wrong, but what sets a good chocolate lava cake apart from the mediocre ones is whether you get sick of it halfway through. Many chocolate lava cakes are overwhelming with their cloying sweetness, and after a few bites it becomes a torture to finish them. But Wimbly Lu’s chocolate lava cake was not. Lastly, our waffles came. It was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside, just the way we love it. The salted caramel ice cream that came along was tasty, and matched well with the waffles, but I found the portions of ice cream a tad too small. But I still think it couldn’t match up to the ones I’ve eaten at the Gelare outlet in Far East Plaza all those years back. I can still recall vividly the aroma of the waffles wafting to our noses, how the crispy surface of the waffles was softened by the creamy cookies and cream ice cream, the combination of hot and cold was just perfect. Sadly, that Gelare has closed down, and I haven’t tasted a waffles as good ever since.For full review and pictures, visit: www.GrumblingStomachs.wordpress.co

I have to say that the location isn't that good, it required 15-20mins walk from Serangoon station, parking lots are limited if you are driving too. The desserts there got my interest and I like how they did the date pudding :) some cakes were interesting as you don't see it elsewhere very often like the root beer cake. The area isn't very big so some might call it cozy and some might say its cramp, I believe it's where you are seated at. Mine was a cozy corner with limited place to places my bagpack and I have to place it on my lap the whole duration. Oh do come early to prevent queueing! Want to know more about my experience?

Was expecting much more from this place given its long queue on weekday nights.Finally visited this place a weekend afternoon and ordered the much raved about rootbeer cake. Was hugely disappointed as it tasted just like a brownie. The accompanying ice cream didn't taste nice too. We ordered fries as well which was served cold. Well the only saving grace was probably that prices were quite reasonable and the place really nicely done up.
4
Our last minute decision to visit Wimbly Lu meant we had to wait in line for seats. We waited for about 15 minutes on a Friday night and ordered the Rocky Road cake, Rootbeer cake and marble cheesecake. Rocky Road and Rootbeer cake are delish and we love the decor of the cafe! The marble cheesecake was nice too but if you only have limited stomach space, go for the rocky road
3
Located next to The Fat Cat and Pizzaiola, this is a nice place to adjourn to for desserts. They have a great variety of cakes which are reasonably priced, and the handmade chocs are also a delight. It is easy to see why this is gaining popularity. As parking around the restaurants is very limited, would suggest that you arrive at 6 pm or late night
