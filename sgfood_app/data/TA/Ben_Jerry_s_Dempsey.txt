Solid ice cream— creamy and delicious with good variety and mixes. Great location with friendly service
4
As always, Ben & Jerry's delivers a consistent ice cream experience with all the expected flavors. The one advantage that this location offers over the standard fare in the United States is being located in the picturesque neighborhood of Dempsey.
5
I love ice cream! Every time I feel down , a tasty ice cream can delight me immediately especially Ben & jerry's, must come in and have one if you pass it by chance~
4
Ben & jerry at Depmpsey Simgapore is a very nice place for good Ice cream and deserts. neat clean and good. centrally located.
4
Some great flavours and a comfortable place to sit and rest. My 4yo daughter loved this place. Not much else to say.
5
I love the Ice Cream and Milkshakes here! It is amazing the layout. I would recommend you go there if you visit Singapore.
5
I love the Ice Cream here! I could come here everyday, it's amazing Ice Cream. The service is ok, not too many smiles, though. Very morden, and nice toilets!
3
Any establishment that can charge $6.50 for a single scoop of ice cream and get away with it, has clearly made a pretty good job of its brand positioning.The prices at this Dempsey Hill establishment were – across the board – eye-watering. Service was good, so that is in its favour. But boy oh boy, I can’t see a value for money proposition anywhere on the menu
3
I like Ben & Jerry's ice cream but the price is just too high for that tiny scoop they give you. The choices are also not complete as they didn't have one of classic cherry garcia. Unless you happen to be in the area and badly want ice cream, I would suggest getting your own tub from the supermarket
1
The guy behind the counter was lovely. He did his very best. However there was very little choice in ice-cream flavours. They hadn't been stored well. Some ice-cream had obviously melted and refrozen. We were not able to order a plain cone as they had run out and were not expecting any anytime soon. The seating area was littered with rubbish from prior customers. Very odd experience. Not what I've had at the Vivo outlet. Wouldn't recommend it
4
Lovely rustic setting for an Ice Cream Parlour with seating outside when full. Good variety of flavors and toppings .Nice place to finish off your dining at Dempsey Hill.
3
We sometimes head over here for dessert after meals. The ice cream is good here but the place is a little run down. One complain is that later in the evenings, the air conditioning is pretty strong especially for an ice cream restaurant
5
Cant go wrong here. Great selection and a nice place to cool off if you have been out in the heat for a while
5
The best place in town to get ice cream. Must try their chocolate chip cookie dough..even though a bit pricey,it is worth it
3
Want to pay to much for an Ice Cream, and service without a smile then Ben & Jerrys Dempsy is on the money. Unfortunately they have a real Monopoly on the Ice Cream market in Dempsy so its not like you are spoilt for choice. If it was not for the Ben & Jerrys name and ice cream flavours kids love this place would probably struggle
5
Ben and Jerry's is GREAT for people with a sweet tooth. They have unique flavors such as "phish food". But don't worry, this flavor is NOT real fish food. It's chocolate ice cream with chunks of chocolate shaped like fish, hence, the name. Ben and Jerry's has cute little house-like things for 2 people. It is very romantic for couples. The bathrooms are rather clean and neat. The cafe even has ice cream cakes and a WIDE variety of flavors. Although the waffle bowl is a little pricey, it is totally worth it. Ben and Jerry's is a MUST GO
3
This place changed its dark interior to a more bright and cheery design. Ice cream and menu choices remained the same. For one scoop of ice cream at sgd6.50 , it was expensive... And super sweet in taste i felt. Some may like it this way especially teenagers.. But i would rather spend my money on other gelato that costs les
3
Saturday night and it was quite crowd but it was not full house. Queue was about 5 groups long. No smiles no offers to allow tasting before choosing flavours. When the cashier found that we were using the Entertainer app to pay she looked unhappy and was condescending and rude. Ice cream was good as usual but seemed to melt a lot faster.
4
Definitely the biggest Icecream parlor I have ever seen and its pretty cool a place as well with their enormous sitting area and also a gig section.They obviously have a massive range of their flavors and are also open till midnight.I tried their signature Chunky Monkey but honesly not a fan of it,a lot of people really seem to love it though.
1
The ice cream is wonderful and the seating is good too. But there is one lady at the counter who is extremely rude, curt and outright arrogant. Wish some of the sweet of the dessert rubs off on her. Terrible experience and will never step into this Ben & Jerry's for sure. A bad end to a fabulous evening at Dempsey
4
If you happen to be around Dempsey Hill, do go to this place and try their numerous ice-cream combinations. Excellent location and excellent ambiance inside.
Live band also. Highly recommended.
4
Very busy and full of energy, always! One can't go wrong with ice-cream, that too at Ben & Jerry's. The sorbet is really good :)
2
one single scoop of ice cream for SGD6.50 is too pricey. It was not a big scoop either and it was very sweet. Better to spend your money on other icecream, freshly made, in the country.
5
Wow.. I was introduced to this place by my brother. They have some really amazing ice creams. The flavour that I liked the best was chunky monkey, but please do not read this to mean that any of the other flavours were anywhere far behind. In fact writing this review makes me want to have a ben and jerry right away. Wish they come to India soon
4
This place is kind of like a cool hippy hang out, serving the worlds best Ice Cream. So, we had a platter to share with everything on it for S$ 30, which was good value. Music played, there was a stage set up and plenty of clientelle to people watch. It was cool after a walk up from Long Beach seafood, there is also outside seating too. Worth a mention just because it was a surprise to be that entertaining, so go give it a look. There was also a bar in here, coffee shop and what looked like a cafe serving hot food too
5
Love love Ben & Jerry's. Not an ice-cream fan but you can always wake me up for B&J's anytime. This ice-cream parlor has a rustic diner feel. Location is a bit far from downtown but there are city cabs on stand-by.I just think though their bathroom facilities need an upgrade
5
I came here for snack with my family after dinner! The ambience is good, i mean cozy but packed with people as i believe singaporean really love ben&jerry from the USA so do I from Malaysia!There's only 4 staff available, please take note the beverages and ice cream counter, they are both separated. The ice cream is imported (i believe as told there's no factory in singapore for it) and the quality of the ice cream is top notch!I ate the Merlion (the name of the set of ice cream got to to do with merlon) which gives me like 5 scoops of ice creams, brownie, banana, waffles and it is DAYUMMMM GOOD
4
I usually wouldn't have entered a place like this if not for its location. After a delicious seafood dinner at Jumbo we decided to take our conversation elsewhere and since the Ben and Jerry's was just across the road, that was where we headed to. The atmosphere was decent, there was a one man band singing to the crowd. The place was crowded and we were a large group. The staff suggested a place behind the counter and we were able to fit in comfortable, though we did find seats closer to the front a little later. The ice cream, well it's Ben & Jerry's.. no complains here though I'd rather go for the local ice cream man experience. Overall, it was a nice place to sit and catch up or just hang out. I also noticed that they had alcoholic beverages but am not sure about prices as I did not partake
3
We were here on a Saturday night after our dinner. when we reached there about 9+pm, there are live band. the atmosphere was great for chilling and relaxing. Initial, I would like to have their famous waffles ice cream but they do not have it. Hence, I ordered a crepe wrapped with 2 scopes of ice-cream while my friends order chocolate brownies abt $18.90. Dont really like it, Still prefer their waffles ice-cream....be prepare to Q for your ice-cream
2
Ice cream selection was alright, ordered the mix&match and banana boat split options.Shortly after we started eating the ice cream (at about 9pm), the live music started and it was blaring with too much bass. It was hard to make out what lyrics were being sung, it hurt our ears and it made it difficult to talk among ourselves.Overall, not that pleasant an experience.. We tried to finish as quickly as possible so that we could leave
3
Went here for dessert after eating at Jumboseafood.
Very pricey. Single scoop of icecream over $6. Milk shake was over $16 ....
Live music was nice but not worth eating here !
5
Went here after dinner on Sat night. Expected it to be 'just another ice-cream shop'. Was WAY more than that!!!! Great ice-cream, good ambience, AND a live singer who could not only sing, but was wicked on the acoustic guitar. Fantastic!
4
Popular ice cream joint. Just the place to come to after a good meal in one of the nearby Dempsey Hill restaurants. Serves coffee too. Lots of tables so can cater for large parties.
5
Been & Jerry's ice cream here in Singapore is quite expensive if you go to the grocery store. But if you just need a serving of Cherries Garcia or one of your other favorites, this is the answer.
5
Was brought here by a colleague during a recent business trip last week and am glad to have discovered Ben & Jerry's!For one, Dempsey Road in itself deserves a special review of its own! Within these serene lush greenery, if you're looking for a place to enjoy multiple flavours of ice cream in a very cosy and hiphop hangout, this is the place! Outside there are seating places with traditional big swings, inside cosy tables, complete with a band and music display on certain days, and aloha! the various flavours of ice cream, free to taste prior to choosing and I would say, very generous portion of scoops to just melt away in your mouth as you savour this must-visit ice cream joint for ice cream lovers
4
Not a great looking restaurant but a place I love to go after dining in another restaurant in Dempsey, to have an ice cream!Just a great place to hang out after dinner, and relax in a casual environment. I think this is a cool place. It is getting expensive though! The ice cream shrank from the past! :
3
Love the ice cream but the waffle... (well, nothing can beat Gelare's!)... The atmostphere was great for a hangout. BUT, they need to do something about the entrance! It is not disabled friendly at all. They need a ramp! People in wheelchairs just cant get up a step that high!
3
This one is like any other B&J outlet. the icecream selections are the same. however, i guess one has a bit more choice in terms of cakes and waffles. i just love the strawberry cheeseshake. the icecream is good but not like the marble slab and coldstonee of the world. the outlet has a very nice environment though and provides one of the few dedicated dessert joints in Dempsey
4
Of course since this is a Ben and Jerry's, you get the exact same quality of ice cream. This place is a bit out of the city up on Dempsey, but it still has more people than you will probably see at any other Ben and Jerry's. Noisy, but the staff is always nice. They share the space with a restaurant so that is where you get the noise from
5
A hit among young Singaporeans, who prefer chilling out with friends on the weekends, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Be sure to be there slightly earlier than 8pm as the place gets crowded as the night draws in, with a live band on Fridays (hence the attraction).I would recommend the Seafood Aglio Olio (by the restaurant part of Ben & Jerry's - CA California). Priced at SGD$29, it can be a tad spicy but pretty good on the taste and presentation. A cup of ice-cream is definitely recommended after a meal, as that's what most patrons come for! Again, a single scoop or two may set one back about SGD$7-$10, but think of the ambience. There is even a vintage mini-van outside the place itself (feel free to take photos with it!). Live music, great ambience, a nice chill-out place! Ben & Jerry's is at Block 8 of Dempsey Hill (Opposite Jumbo Seafood Restaurant).Recommended to take a taxi there from the nearest : Orchard Road area
4
Great to go there at night. You got to drive up there as there isn't any public transport right up to the doorstep. There's also live music at certain timing.
4
I love the spicy chocolate flavour to the max! New york super fudge was also very good. The best thing about Ben & Jerry to me is that its ice creams are filled with nuts or chocolates for a crunchy bite.
4
We love this ice cream shop, even though the ice cream is redicously priced, but while the kids are have an ice cream mum and dad can have a beer or a glass of wine and even listen to some music from the live band.
4
Who can dislike ice-cream, especially of this quality? So I'll just talk about the place. It's a superb place for gathering, but don't come on weekends, it's too packed!
4
Good but expensive ice cream. A safe location in Dempsey that does not disappoint. Would go there again.
4
Service is not perfect, but they try. Atmosphere is nice for families and others. I like that water is readily available for you to collect without having to ask for it. In Singapore, this makes a huge difference, since it is always hot here.
5
Dempsey is a really cool place to hang out at night, especially since many shops here close early. The atmosphere is almost perfect but can be packed sometimes.
4
This ice cream shop is right across the street from Jumbo Seafood. It was a nice sweet treat after dinner, only about 15 flavors. They have a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, waffle cones, sugar cones, sundaes..A great place for families with young kids! It is in block 8, you WILL need to know your blocks when visiting Dempsey
4
We ordered Nachos, Salmon sandwich, the all-in burger and the bratwurst sausage platter. Everything was good. Especially enjoyed the bratwurst. There's a live band on Friday nights. Dempsey is an area filled with bistros, pubs, cafes and all manner of eateries. It was an old army barrack, resurrected for a hip eating area. Well worth visiting. We only did Ben and Jerry's, aka CA (California). The food is CA, the dessert is Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Nice and casual. Taxis do go there but getting a cab back might be a tad troublesome. You might want to walk out to the main road for that
5
How do u make an ice cream parlor into a hangout? Add live music! Pleasantly surprised last Friday while stepping into the place to grab our cups and dash out, we stayed, mulled over the ice cream thanks to a singer and an on going leaving do. Great vibe, and never miss the chocolate fudge brownie.
4
Popular Dempsey Hill hangout at the top of the hill. Ice cream is great but go there for the people watching.
4
Can't go wrong with Ben and Jerry's and this location has the charm and care-free atmosphere that will make any family visit or date enjoyable. Always love going back and will keep doing so.
4
A great place to bring kids or friends. On the weekends they have brunch, and in the evenings they have live music. Its got a nice family-friendly atmosphere.
4
Ben & Jerrys is located within a deli type restaurant so you can have a meal as well as sit down for some Ice cream as well. Ben & Jerry's is always great....wish they introduce some great Yoghurts as well !
4
Nice place to hangout but avoid Friday night as it is crowed. The kids love the place and the taste of ice cream. We wish there will be more stand alone outlet in Singapore
1
I could make better pizza using a shoebox and fish guts. Save your money!
4
Friends and I decided on Dempsey for some dessert, bringing us to Ben & Jerry's. The place was not crowded on a Sunday late afternoon with ample seats around. We lounged on the sofa seats and ordered 2 creations to share. With nice music playing the background, it was a nice, great way to relax and laze away the weekend!
4
If you are a fan of really sweet ice cream & snacks, ben & jerry's is your place. There was a live band playing some really nice sounds there & the atmostphere was really good. I personally find the added chocolate syrup on my ice cream waffle too sweet so I did not really enjoy my ice cream waffle as the ice creams are really much too sweet for me
2
We arrived with an overseas friend around 10minutes before opening time last Saturday and was not able to order from the ice cream section. It was unfortunate that we were early but the girl behind the counter just said "we are not open." in an abrupt manner. Perhaps she was too busy that she was unable to assist in informing us that we can be served in 10 minutes time. Needless to say, we did not order our ice cream as we felt that we were too "busy" to bother facing her super unfriendly face (totally unlike normal B&J culture)
3
One of the earlier reviewers said 'worth one try' I think and I'd agree with that.The service is poor and the food OK but not upto the standard of other places nearby. The prices appear slightly lower but don't get tricked by that because the food and servings aren't nearly as good.The coffee is very average. They have Flat White on the menu but no one who knows how to make one so just order a white coffee as you'll get the same thing.The ambience is great, however, and if you can catch it when it isn't full of screaming kids then a nice place to sit but brace yourself for fights by spoilt children over ice cream
5
Seldom do we chill out and have ice cream. However, at B&J Dempsey, you can do both @ the same time.
4
Its ice-cream you want, its ice-cream you will get. Snacks and grubs good too.
4
The place is a really nice and cosy place. And it has nice seaTS inside and outside the Ben & Jerry's. They have friendly customer services.
5
Ice Cream parlours anyone? This is one the best in town. So much life in here.. And best selection.
3
Well, if you don't mind paying more to sit in a resturant to eat your B & J, then this is the place.
I guess you are paying more just for the ambiance which I think it is just nothing much.
Worth one try.
5
gr8 place to get ur kids and have a blast. theres a live band on selected days too!
1
Went there with my daughter. We had two scoops of ice cream each in a cup. Cost almost $20 SGD! Way too expensive for mediocre ice cream!
4
If you are up in the Dempsey Hill area and have just finished a great meal in one of the superb restaurants on the hile then I suggest visiting Ben & Jerry's afterwards. You can take a nice leisurely walk to visit other restaurants, check out thier menus for you next outing and then after that stop at Ben & Jerry's for a nice cold dessert. We went on Saturday evening and they had a band playing as well. If you want to skip the band you have your order as a take away and continue to walk around. You do however need to go up to the counter to place your order
4
Great if you like Ben and Jerry's ice-cream- its ok, nothing special and usually sold at a discount in the UK as Haagen Daz is more popular in England and Organic ice cream like Green and Blacks in England is infinitely better tasting.. but in Singapore its fine.. its hot so they have a market for this stuff that is about 3 times the European priceBut its fin
3
Ben and Jerry's is conjoining to a childrens play area (different company), what more do kids want, play and ice cream? But the ambience is not very acurate as many of Ben and Jerry's outlets that are distributed throughout Singapore use playful anf fun furniture and wall paper, but the ambience here is that of a wooden lodge in the coniferous forests of america, it is completly the wrong atmosphere to have for a fun company such as Ben and jerry'
4
What's great about this is you can order your favorite B&J ice cream with the sumptuous cakes from its neighbor stall.
3
Good place with nice ambience!! But during weekend nights it can be rather crowded.
4
Love the store!
3
We felt old going to this place. Full of teenagers but the ice cream makes us feel young at heart. ;) The smell of pancakes and waffles drifts through the whole outlet. The interior is refurbished to look like a country barn house.
5
B&J is my fav ice cream.
3
A huge space compared to their other ice cream outlets in the malls. Ice creams are pretty standard, but has a pretty laid back vibe - good place to hang out with pals.
1
An alternative place for gathering which includes kids. But prepare to pay $10-$15 for a small cup of ice cream + toppings, OR Ice Mocha with a scoop of ice cream.
4
very nice and cosy ambiance. love the ice creams... but not the food.
5
Ben and jerrys are always nice ((:
1
My family and I were there last night ( 28/09/2010-10pm-Dempsey). the young girl service staff seem not comfortable with me , young uncle not familiar with icecream flavour.I am a icecream lover, and known about ben & Jerry's , however I am not sure about the flavours they have, what not have. I wanted my family to enjoy various flavours of icecream by ordering a Merlionster DM, and i was told to chose 6 flavours, I can not see the small name stick on the glass and statrs to point finger to the young girl, but she seem very unhappy with me not knowing the name or which colour I wants.She is NOT smiling at all. I am equally upset and unhappy....with my first time experience ordering the icecream at the counter...because they said we have to order and pay at the counter.Also, there are two side of the icecream counter , which both side have many people standing to order their flavours. I could not see what is available at the other side......!People are blocking there.Also, my naphew wanted to have a Brownie Special DM , he can only chose from one side from the counter....he didn't wants to troubler the staff towalk there, and also the other side is Jam with other people....!Althought the taste of icecream is good, but I am upset with this kind of BAD service...Not because of the price I paid, ( service charge $5.66+ GST ), maybe because of the management training problem with staff's. Maybe , they need to look into this kind of detail with staff facing problem..!not helpful enough with customer.Unhappy icecream lover-Roger Ta

luv their ice cream.. nice and creamy
3
nice ambience for ice cream.. this has the laid back quality of an old ranch..
3
teleport you instantly to a ranch retreat holiday. too crowded though
4
Nice ambience and orgasmic brownie
3
Not a big ice cream person, but the atmosphere and seating is fab.
5
Such a fun place to hang out with friends or to celebrate birthdays for kids and adults!
4
a cup of chunky monkey, and a great atmosphere...
4
Nice chilled place to get your sugar fix
2
great ambiance - but i aint a big fan of Ben and jerry's :))
4
Always packed, but a great family place. Sofa's are dope.
3
Love the environment.. such happy and cheery staff, a great pick-me-up place :)
3
cosy pl... kids will also love tis pl
4
Cosy place best visited on a weekday afternoon to beat the crowds. Quality desserts and a solid sandwich place next door.
3
Good ambience - if you can get a table and a parking lot
1
atmosphere is very strange. Its not a happy family type of place. Feels like a pub on the inside
3
Ice Cream standard as good as packaged ben & jerry in supermarkets. But the ambience is good with Live Singing. Good voice and guitar-playing.
5
If it is Ice cream from Vermont its got to be Ben & Jerry's. The best at infusion!!
3
If you pay attention to detail, they've put in affort to design the ice-cream eatery with a good study of spacial constructs in their interior decor. they got the chill-out area, the intimate living room area, the private curtain room area, and the casual boxed-in area... not to forget, the al fresco area. great experience every time! lovely! though... ice cream is pretty pricey *tsk tsk
5
Ben & Jerry's, can't go wrong. Throw in settings complete with outdoor swing chairs that you can sit barefooted and swing in rythmn to the slow afternoon breeze on a lazy afternoon ... I can only say, "Cest La Vie". Will recommend my all time fave : Chucky Monkey. Always a perk-me-up, however bad my day has been ;
