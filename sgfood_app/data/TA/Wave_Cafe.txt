A place for a quick snack if you are feeling hungry.Menu is limited not many choices of food. Good selection of cakes,pies & slices of pizzas.There are no freshly squeezed juices its from the bottle. Ordered a pineapple juice and it taste terrible.

This cafe located at the Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy Hotel at lobby level next to the reception area. Serving good coffee, fresh juice and some light foods. The cold showcases have some cold drinks, ice cream (Hagendaaz, Magnum, Gelato, and Ben and Jerry), ready made sandwiches, fruit salads, yogurt and cheese. Very comprehensive and very good to have some foods and soft drinks on the run.
