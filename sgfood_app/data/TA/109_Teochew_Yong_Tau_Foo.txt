You can choose your own ingredients and taste's fantastic. I tried different types of noodles and all is great. Laksa noodle was excellent, and if you want rice, you can have as a soup with a bowl of rice.

Travelling with business and just need a quick cheap soup or laksa. You choose your own ingredients and a noodle style and it is cooked in front of you. This place is very popular with the locals, and so the ingredients are turned over quickly. Very fresh. Ate here about 4 times in the 6 days I was in Singapore. A huge soup with stacks of ingredients will not be over $10.

Came here for lunch. This is a popular place with office workers. Got to come earlier to beat the lunch crowd. They have different soup base. Clear soup or laksa. There's also a pretty decent variety of Yong tau foo to choose from. One of the cheaper eats along circular road. It's nice too.
