Service staff, a gentleman was very patience in explaining the desserts portioning. His partner, a gal was equally good. Service was IMPECCABLE. Desserts not too sweet which is much to our likings...My daughter & wife luvs it very much.

Lovely place to take photograph for Instagram and even the food fair very well. My friends are in love with the rainbow pasta (who makes rainbow pasta nowadays) and especially the chocolate seduction cake.

I would give the presentation of food a perfect 10 but when it comes to taste.... It's a Nah!!! Maybe 5/10...the ambience is great. Staff were okay... I would say the this place is an Intagram-worthy place.

The entire interior is decked out in psychedelic colors and dubbed the "most colorful dessert cafe" in Singapore, I knew I had to try it. They introduced the Rainbow Pasta series and we tried one of that together with the rainbow cake. The pasta base is so good that we had to lick dry the entire bowl. The cake compliments the main course as well. Super loving it. The ambience is a stellar too where we camp there for hours because the privacy walls seating makes it so comfortable. We will be back to try the other flavours of Rainbow Pasta series !

The rainbow cake was BIG and not too sweet, but all the cotton candies, cookies, and unicorn ice cream around it was just sweet sweet and sweet.....The Non-dessert part was not so good, the dough past was hard like rock, and coffee is just machine coffee...........so I only recommend the dessert

With hip concrete seats, fuel drum lights and splashed paint decor, sugar lips sets the scene for some radical deserts. Our lemonade was served in a carafe with straws and the deserts came with many toppings. So sweet and so yum, but not too much. The cake was beautifully moist. All up a great spot for sweet and cake lovers. Shame it is our last night or we would be bac

If you think you’ve died and gone to dessert haven, perhaps that’s because you stepped into Sugar Lips and got kissed. Just looking at their delectable offerings is enough to make anyone drool.A canary wonderland and a feast of the senses, Sugar Lips is filled with bright colours. The Rainbow Fantasy cake looks like something fit for a magical being. Even the layout of the store looks magical, with colourful paint splatters decorating the walls and the floor. And that makes for a pretty cool outlet
