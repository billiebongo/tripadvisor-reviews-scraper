Went dinner with my colleagues and guests from oversea. Ordered a 7 course set dinner and food was good and comes is small portion. Good for people who does not want to have too much.

We went here on a business lunch and were really impressed with the quality and selection. It is Cantonese style so it is only mildly spiced. Definitely recommend the dim sum dishes.

The Peking duck at this restaurant was absolutely superb! Service was likewise, but who noticed? Just a wonderful experience.

Nice selection of food and they have some dishes that don't have fish for kids that don't want it. They also offer a platter of food for you to share with your other half.

A must try restaurant offering excellent freshly prepared yum cha ratehr than the trolley service. Also a great seafood menu offering excellent fresh seafood. Not cheap but the quality is here.

Love their 'Yum Cha'. The food is excellent. Open daily at 11.30 till noon. Love their Panfried carrot cake, fried cheong fun with sesame peanut sauce..very tasteful. Their service also excellent. Very recommended place to eat.

Large restaurant and nice Chinese decor but not very busy and mainly local clientele. Menu a little confusing and lots of more unusual delicacies not to our palette. The Peking duck was nice although would have preferred not to be served the head as well on the plate. The scallops with asparagus and the vegetables were tasty. It was hard to find things on the menu we liked and the staffs English was very poor and quite slow in service too. They add cover charge per person too. Very brightly lit even though it was evening. Prices were reasonable.

Had a work dinner with colleagues while hosting a visitor from overseas. The food is extremely tasty. It was a week night and the place is pretty busy. The downside is the price tag. It is extremely expensive even though we did not order a lot of expensive items

The location of the restaurant, at 30 Victoria Street in the Chijmes is the only good thing about it. Maybe we made a mistake by going in the evening instead of at lunch time, but the maitre d' was the only smiling face we saw among the staff. The decor was bland but that was nothing compared to the food.The food was taste free. The prawn starter tasted of cooking oil, and when I pointed out a very large maggot on my garnish, the garnish was removed and i was left with the prawns. - no apology, nothing taken off the bill. When the bill came it was the highest we had encountered in Singapore, and we had been charged for the wet wipes
