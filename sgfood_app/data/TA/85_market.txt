You will find lots of food and people here till early hours of the morning. Lot of selection of mostly chinese food. Cheap (but has gone more expensive increasingly due to popularity). Try satay, bak chor mee, the seafood stuff, bbq stingray, etc.

They operates till very late as to 2pm, if you're in searching for good food and value for money. Most of the food you can think of are also can be found here.

If you are craving for the usual supper food like oysters, fried BBQ wings, satay, char kway teow, etc., this is the place to go. Only issue is parking is very limited so go early or avoid weekends.

This evening, visited 85 Market located at Blk 85 Bedok North Street 4 for dinner. Sitting at the circumference of the stall can be cooling. Spotted few of accreditation certificates at Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian (Stall 01-07). This stall serves noodles soup only (no dry noodles). The very first sip of the soup was simply wow... tasty clear soup. The meat balls tasted good too. For $3 for a bowl is little portion. For a better eater, may need to consider $4 or $5. Truly enjoyed.The neighbouring corner minced pork noodles stall serves both types of noodles. (Yet to try.) A prawn cracker stall on the same row serves oily food. The oil sipped, stayed on the prawn cracker.

Found this old school singapore style snacks when walking through the market it is at #01-101 they sell the snack at $2 and $3 a bag as well as traditional coffee powder. The owner was very friendly and shared with me the history of this Bedok market. Many of these shops have been around for 20 years

This evening, visited 85 Market located at Blk 85 Bedok North Street 4 for dinner.Spotted long queue at stall 01-41 selling satay been hoon. Decided to join the queue. Waited 35 minutes to have a plate of satay bee hoon. Been hoon, kankong, bean sprout, pork, liver and clam mixed with satay gravy. Available in $3 and $4. Big portion.The queue was constant and non-stop. Tasty and little spicy. Enjoyed

123 wanton noodle at the first row (#01-69) is the highlight of my weekly trip to 85 market. The stall has very personalised and attentive service, the stall owner remembers my orders and can customise it to my taste. The dumplings and wanton are freshly made everyday too. This rare stall where the owner not only runs her own stall but cares about the way her food tastes. A rarity in corporatised Singapore

Food is everywhere in Singapore, and you will never run out of options. Beyond restaurants, a true foodie has to experience food like a local does. "85 Market" (official name Fengshan Food Centre) offers you a really nice mix of local yummies, at a great price. After eating here on and off for more than 15 years or so, these are my personal favourites:The best bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) has to be from Ah Poh Minced Meat Noodle (unit #01-18). There are at least 2 other bak chor mee stalls, but this is, to me, the best in terms of the texture of the noodles, its tasty pork balls and flavourful soup. Not feeling too good? Order a hot bowl of congee from Chai Chee Pork Porridge (#01-23) - smooth, comforting and easy on the stomach. Want to spice things up? Get yourself a grilled stingray from the corner Chan BBQ (#01-24) stall with the yellow signboard. Dig your chopsticks into some "ou qian/orh luak" (oyster omelette) from 85 Fried Oyster (#01-09/10) and/or get your hands oily (the only way to eat it!) with perfectly grilled chicken wings from the corner Sin Bedok North chicken wings stall (#01-12). For dessert, enjoy a hot bowl of tang yuan "ah balling" (yup that's the name of the stall as well) of which you have 3 "soups" to choose from - ginger, almond and peanut. Established 1947, apparently! This place is rather quiet in the afternoon, but comes alive in the evening so that's when you want to visit, with an empty stomach and a good time in mind.Enjoy!PS: Unit numbers correct at time of posting

In the evening, it is abit hard to find place to sit. Ordered bak chor mee, prawn omelette, carrot cake, sugarcane juice and BBQ chicken wing. After you ordered, they will send the foods and drinks to your table. Remember your table number! The price was reasonable. Overall is grea

Affectionately known as 85 market, the Fengshan Food Centre Blk 85 Bedok North Road Singapore 460085, is a typical hawker food court with unbelievably good food. As its open late into the night, we went for supper. Even after 10 p.m., the atmosphere was boisterous and festive. Be prepared to queue to get a table – the market is very popular with locals. Once you get a place to park yourselves, you need to order at each individual stall and give them your table number - they will deliver the food to your table. Friendly hawker “aunties” will usually come and take the drinks order at your table.The most popular dish seems to be the bak chor mee, although almost everything we ate (and boy, did we eat!!) was great – the carrot cake / oyster omelette, sambal stingray, and even the desserts. I was busy stuffing my face while my host named the dishes, so don’t remember more of their names… suffice to say you’d be very unlucky to order something that wasn’t tasty. And the prices, as befits a hawker centre away from the city centre, are very reasonable. All in all, a very good culinary experience

I go there a lot. Most afternoon when I school early I will go there to grab lunch. On days that my parents are free we go there for dinner. The BBQ, satay and chicken wings are my favourite there.

The wait for the bak chor mee xing Ji is way too long. It's supposed to be 30 mins. I think we waited for more than 60. I am full even before tasting it. Don't want to do such things again.

Just went to newly opened Market not long ago. Went in the morning as I have an errand to run in the area. My favourite stalls like bak chor mee, fried prawn noodle, BBQ chicken wings and Ngoh Hiang are not opened. However, am delighted to find quite a bit of stores opened at the back. Fromm wanton noodle to teochew porridge, dessert, traditional food like Zhui kuay, CHEE Cheong fun, favourite economy fried bee Hoon. Enough of variety for a good breakfast. Are the food I tried the best that morning? Not exactly but I left satisfied:

If you love good an cheap food, this is the right place to go! Go for the famous Bak Chor Mee (minced pork noodles), Orh Lua (Oyster omelette), BBQ chix wings, Chai Chee porridge and last but not least, the fantastic dessert stall that sells super tasty red bean soup, gula melaka ice kachang (not on their menu! must special request!) and best tau suan!

Like everyone else is screaming, first thing to order @ 85 market is the Bak Chor Mee. There are 2 competing stores right next to each other, so you can be assured that they keep up the quality in order to keep their customers coming back! Other things that one can order @ 85 market include; carrot cake/oyster omelette, BBQ chicken wings, sambal stingray and hokkien mee~

Food paradise! There's bak chor mee, BBQ seafood, oyster omelet, carrot cake, chix wings, hokkien mee, etc. For those who prefers healthier choices, the porridge is goood and the fish soup noodles (in clear soup) is a good choice. For those who likes tang yuan, they have it too (in peanut soup). It's a normal hawker centre, but there's just something that makes the food taste so much nicer. But if it's raining, pls go another day. It's already difficult enuff finding seats on a dry day
