Sauteed noodles with blood clams, with lard chips. I had been a regular customer since the late 80s and each plate tasted just like before. Be prepared to wait in line, patiently. Serves only dinner 5 - 9pm, Monday to Friday.

The queue is long and slow but that does not deter the faithful showing up at this famous stall that has last many decades. The owner/chef/cashier runs this one man shop with bare minimum facilities but the end product is Thia amazingly moist char kuay teow with fresh cockles and crunchy crispy deep fried pork lards. Healthy food, probably not high on the list but it is surely cooked with sweat, blood and passion

The uncle was friendly and patient, cooking 1 plate each time. I understand that he demands consistency over quantity. Well fried with cockles and lard, no sausage or fish cake like most others. Patience is required with at least 30 mins wait. Good but not worth the queue for me.
