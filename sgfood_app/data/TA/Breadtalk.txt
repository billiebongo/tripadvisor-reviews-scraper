Breadtalk is one of our favourite places in Singapore. The cakes and savoury items are delicious and very good value. Try the chicken Parmesan rolls.

This place is reasonable and provides good buns and muffins. Its pretty reasonable too. They have their outlets across Singapore.

Breadtalk used to have good quality taste but in recent years, I guess as they grown, they opt for cheap quality ingredients . Quality is definitely affected

Love this place, foods fresh and really cheap a great place to buy lunches etc and the apple pies are divine. I love the custard rolls also.

Nice mini golden lava croissant. With all these salted egg craze, Breadtalk serves their own version of salted egg cream in a croissant and I love that they made it a mini croissant. In itself with the strong salted egg flavor, this is quite a heavy snack.They also sell the cheese tart with salted egg which was interesting but to me, the strong salted egg and the cheese flavors clash.Overall, I still love the pork floss bread :-
