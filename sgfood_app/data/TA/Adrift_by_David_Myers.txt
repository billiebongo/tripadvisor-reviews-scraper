A hotel lobby restaurant with friendly, efficient service, entirely acceptable food and a jaw-droppingly marked up wine list.
Crab rolls pleasant, glazed tongue also pleasant. Burger, acceptable and instantly forgettable.

We had breakfast here when they reopened in December. The breakfast was okay, but not great. The short order eggs cook didn't understand English and sent us to the other side of the restaurant. Food was disappointing really, especially for the price.
5
Went for after dinner cocktails and it was a perfect end to an already awesome evening. The bartender was very knowledgable and interacted with customers continually making everyone feel welcome.
4
Very good service, excellent food. Eggs Benedict a bit too watery for my taste. Food in small portion and pricey but filling. Don’t miss the king crab melt
3
The restaurant ambience is relaxing for a Sunday brunch. Food presentation for brunch is “bland” and surprising “minimalist” - more can be done. Taste is average for food. Good selection of drinks, including cocktails / alcoholic mix.

We went there late evening and spent around 300 dollars hoping to get nice food. We've ordered Wagyu cheeseburger - profoundly tasteless. I did not expect beef patty to be good quality wagyu in a burger, but I did expect it to taste nice. Judging by the amount of jalapeno chef is perfectly aware of it and tries to make it less obvious with spicy and strong taste. Our waitress (who is serving steaks worth more than 100 dollars per 100 grams) could not tell us about the difference between the steaks. The 115 dollars ms9+ steak was cold when served and nothing special. Not bad, but really nothing special. Japanese sweet potato was almost inedible (although it might be just me not liking it) and the sauce tasted just cheap (if there is anyone in the world who really liked this sauce I would very much like to see them). The cocktails were alright
4
You never know who you might see in this celebrity restaurant. Make sure you sit out the back as the actual restaurant has a great vibe - better than the lounges in the side.The cocktails are some of the best in town. Huge menu & they’ll also bespoke make them to suit your taste buds at the time.The menu is eclectic, there’s everything from cheesy toasted sandwiches to gourmet ceviche.We had an assortment & to be honest we struggled to feel full, as dishes are quite small.But that’s the only criticism. A fun night out.
3
Visited with my partner last night, for a night cap.Wonderfully friendly hostess and servers - starting to think that’s standard for Singapore but it’s so refreshing! Really nice vibe - dark panelling with flecks of gold. Decent music, if not a little too loud. Felt very relaxed in there, and not like you’re in a box in the foyer of MBS. Sat at the bar and had a couple of cocktails - I ordered a diamonds and pearls “vodka, blackberry and hint of coconut” - pretty much a purple coconut drink - not great. We then tried a Tuk Tuk Thief : Rum, pineapple and lemon / bitters “ - far too sour. Perhaps we picked badly, but wasn’t massively impressed with the drinks. Food however, looked great, but we didn’t eat on this occasion

We made a quick decision to grab a late dinner after a long day of tourist activities and shopping in Singapore. It turned out to be a memorable experience with excellent food delivered with outstanding customer service from the staff. The head waiter found a table for 5 quickly with the restaurant probably half full at 10:30 pm. Music was pretty loud at the bar but not too loud to restrict conversation at the table. Wine list was very reasonable and we chose from the 50 wines for $50 list after guidance from the waiter. Great decision and a well priced NZ white was enjoyed by the 2 adults. Orders were placed quickly from the Late Dining Menu and only took 20 min to get to the table. The small roast chicken dish proved popular with 3 orders and it didn't disappoint. Unique flavour and well presented. I had the Waygu Burger which was one of the best burgers i have eaten. Portion sizes were just right and beautifully cooked. Side dishes of Broccoli, and the House Cut Fries were a perfect accompaniment. We finished off with a shared plate between the 5 of us of Sea Salt Chocolate Tart & the Marinated Pineapple. Having a little taste of these delights was the perfect end to our spontaneous late night meal. We all left feeling like we had just enjoyed a memorable dining experience to end the 1st day of our trip to Singapore. It was extremely reasonable for the quality of food and service we enjoyed will be hard to beat over the next 7 days. The advice I had prior to my trip was to avoid the over priced and underwhelming restaurants at Marina Bay Sands. This is certainly not the case with Adrift and I can highly recommend it for anyone looking for a high quality and great value dining experience
2
I went to Adrift today for lunch with 5 people to start the new year off in a positive way. One of my friends ordered the chicken which was completely raw, so we decided to tell the staff that we don't want this dish anymore and that its raw on the inside. After showing the staff member the redness of the chicken, they questioned it on the table and didn't even apologize for the rawness. They then the raw chicken for inspection and the waiter was never to be seen. As we asked for the bill they even charged us for the raw chicken and we had to point out that we didn't eat the dish. The service staff didn't even apologize for the situation. I must say this was a first for me and I won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone
4
Had the tasting menu (6-course meal) good taste overall. Dessert was a bit over sweetened. Ox tongue is my favourite.
4
Try the Chef's recommendation. Excellent choices. Portions are reasonable and priced to suit. Pity we could not catch a glimpse of the Ladies tennis stars as we had a concert to attend.
4
First time to Adrift and the dining experience was good, quiet place and good for having a lazy Sunday chit-chat.
5
“The place” in Marina Bays Sands, try the 7 courses menu with wine pairing, it was quite an experience.
It was a surprising fine Asian Cousine offering, must try!
Service was really good too.
Enjoy!
2
The free rice cracker serve by them was full of oil.
Food is fusion and noting to shout about.
The ambience is good for small or big group.
5
We just love the choice of food. There was a good variety of starters as well as main dishes. Desserts were delicious too. The staff was friendly and efficient. They were friendly to the kids too. We will sure come back again.
4
Upon trying the brunch menu, I was very impressed by the Chilli Crab Omelette. It is evident that you pay for good organic eggs and real crab meat because they were both plated in an exquisite manner with each mouthful filled with soft fluffy eggs and a fully loaded chilli crab meat. I also tried the pancakes which were very delicate and beautifully presented, but the portion was disappointing, at least for me. The drinks, and food menu has been carefully thought and presented beautifully as expected of an acclaimed chef. However, if you are looking for a good tuck in, and yet do not wish to pay too much for your brunch, you may want to take note that the portions relatively small. Still, it is exquisite food and one should try it making a normal meal extraordinary
5
Adrift is a really cool restaurant, with its sleek interiors and the picturesque window in the main dining room.I had the salmon tatare with ikura for my starter and the grilled lamb for my main. The food was perfectly seasoned, and the plating was delicate and beautiful.The service at Adrift is really good, with friendly servers and a very warm, personable manager.Overall, the experience I had was terrific, and I will definitely return
5
Loved the place; we kicked the evening of with cocktails - the trouble maker was excellent, could have been invented just for me, I hope I can find it elsewhere, or I have to travel back for it! The Foie Gras Banh Mi for starters just melted in the mouth, and the main courses were delicious! I had Wagyu Cheeseburger, really nicely done and tasty. Compliments on the roasted chicken as well, and the side order, Baby Gem Lettuce, also yummy. The service was prompt and courteous, very happy with our experience
1
We were in Singapore this week for a conference, and twice visited Adrift for a business lunch. On both occasions the speed of service was, well, Adrift. On the first day, our main courses arrived after 45 minutes, allowing our guests to bolt half their lunch before returning to the conference for a meeting. We also encountered their "health drink": by all means serve such an item, but at least have the decency to flag that it costs S$14 for a small glass? Our hearts sank when we returned the next day as guests. We ordered at 12:10, finally receiving our food (main only!) at 1:20 despite having complained on several occasions. At least we did get served: no-one else in the main restaurant had been served anything by the time we left - again having bolted food to try and get to a meeting. The restaurant had a substantial private party eating at the same time, and clearly everything was being done to cater for them - nothing for the rest of us.I think one star is fair: by way of apology, the meal was free (as I understand were some others), and our host received a bottle of wine.The food? The burger was average, the chicken pleasant but nothing special, the broccoli was good. Such a shame.
5
Pork collar melts in your mouth❤️. Ox tongue is very flavorful, the sadachi apple give a balance to it.
5
What a great place to have breakfast,great friendly staff and service was excellent.
A wide selection of buffet and a egg station to suit your needs.
4
Loved the dim lights, delicious, delicious modern Asian/Australian food. Will definitely be back for more!
5
Excellent food and outstanding service. We made the right choice to host an important business lunch here, and at amazing value too. Much thought was put into quality and presentation of the dishes, so each mouthful is a pleasure. We will come back!
5
We dined here as part of the Marina Bay Sands Dine and Show package which was excellent value. Pre theatre dinner then a show.
4
We had breakfast here while staying in the hotel. It was a buffet with everything that one would expect. The coffee and hot chocolate were exceptional.
5
Adrift starts the day right by providing great buffet breakfast. With a good selection of quality food choices, covering local Singapore dishes to international cuisine, this restaurant should never be missed especially by guests staying at the MBS. The bacon is to die for (figuratively), and I believe it is the best item. In fact, it is one of the best-tasting bacon varieties I have tried so far. For someone like me from the Philippines where plums are not common, seeing these fruits served unlimitedly is a major plus factor.The place is conducive for having an enjoyable yet relaxing breakfast, be it with family, friends or business partners. It is clean and with ample space to accommodate a lot of customers. The staff are very attentive and prompt in serving the guests. They are also very welcoming in taking photos
5
We went for lunch recently and tried the power lunch $19++, the menu was rather plain and didn't sound interesting but the food turned out to be a pleasant surprise for all of us. The hamachi salad was fresh and light..great for appetizer and the sea bass as main course was tasty, beautifully presented and a little small portion, the dessert was a pumpkin cake, with complimentary ice jasmine tea with infused mango. The whole experience was Great, staffs were lovely and helpful. Will come back for more
4
Eat here last night with a customer. The area is stunning, with the restaurant fitting into the very nice area.The venue is excellent for impressing customers. The food was tasty but a little on the small side. The price as you might expect a little on the high side. Overall, very goo
5
On a business trip and this time my wife accompanied me as we had 2 consecutive birthdays happening at the week's end. We spent the last three days at the Marina Bay Sands and with 80 restaurants to choose from we had read up on a few and chose Adrift as our first lunch. The staff were engaging and pleasant and asked why we were staying at the Hotel so my wife explained the end of a business trip and celebration of two birthdays. That said they fussed around us very nicely with a special desert with happy Birthday scribed in icing on the plate and a candle followed by two special cocktails form the Barman. Apart from that the food was excellent. We were quite taken with the attention and the overall experience and at my wife's request we cancelled a booking for Dinner the next evening as she wished to return to Adrift to celebrate her birthday and we did with all the same pomp and ceremony. We asked the Maitre d' if the Chef could come to our table in order that we may compliment him on the cuisine and as it turned out it was a fellow Aussie, Wayne, from Brisbane
4
Wines on the list was very very overpriced.. even for the Marina Bay Area. However the 50 for 50 offer makes up for this. Nevertheless, nice atmosphere and service.
5
Great lunch menu!! $19++ for a 3 course lunch set; good quality and all courses were good. will be back
3
The ambience was good but I find it a bit pricey for the food though it is a celebrity restaurant. The service was not excellent for the price we pay.
1
The food was okay but the service was terrible. The manager in charged was rude and not sincere in attending to our needs. Probably one of the worst restaurants I have patronised, and I do travel a lot.
4
Be sure to make a reservation and enjoy the food here. Slightly pricey but this concise yet delicious menu has some great food on offering.
5
The food was top notch and the service very attentive. Had the steak and egg for brunch and it was very tasty. Would go again and recommend friends.
3
I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and visited this restaurant twice. Drinks were weak and food was not good, especially for the prices. Eventually, we just ordered french fries - can't go wrong with those. April was a great waitress. Thanks, April, for all of your assistance
5
Chanced upon this bar whilst checking out the hotel after a trip to the Botanical Gardens and so glad we found it ..... the bar menu was different to the usual deep fried options usually found in a bar and reasonably priced but what made it for us was Vojta who was the bar tender mixing our cocktails. His attention to detail was amazing and his alcohol alchemy was second to none. His blending of flavours was perfect and the 'old fashioneds' he was making for my friend were second to none. Highly recommend a visit here if you want to taste cocktails that are made the way they should be .... awesome work Vojta you are a master of the craft ......
4
Was there for lunch today, To start on a positive the food was excellent jut think we got poor timing, although in a fairly small setting should not matter. We arrived and were promptly shown to a table but then had to get the attention of a server for drinks order which came promptly. When we ordered we were left waiting for some time for starters but as soon as we asked where they were they were bought to the table (2 were delivered and 1 person had a 5 minute wait) and then mains another fairly lengthy gap between the food being taken to our table. Didn't have time to wait for a dessert unfortunately
5
One of the most delicious lamp chops is served in this place, very delicious food, excellent service, Eric was a very helpful and attended to all our needs with great knowledge of the food ingredients and made it easy for us to select the best choice from the a la carte menu, good for couples, family and business.
5
Food was up to standard as always :). The restaurant recently had a week-long promotion ongoing which is very attractive as well!
5
Great vibe and best wage burger ever.
Highly recommend this place and easy to get to no matter where you stay in Singapore
5
Loved the seafood brunch!!!! Fresh and so much variety! Great view.... ambience... service. We'll definitely visit again!
1
I really liked the look of the menu, however the restaurant had VERY lound (non) background music.
We had to leave and can understand why there was only one person in the huge restauarnt
4
Corporate dinner so i guess service need to be exemplary! Well, food quality was excellent and wine was good!
4
It is a pleasant experience. I have brunch with Friend to celebrate his birthday . The background music was soft so we could enjoy our conversation. Service was also prompt and food were tasty.
3
We decided to have dinner here after a visit to Gardens by the Bay. We were shown to a nice low-lying table and greeted by very pleasant and attentive staff. We ordered with much anticipation, given the ‘Signature’ nature of the restaurant. However, without being bad in any way, the various dishes ordered - mains and desserts- did not live up to our expectations. We expected more ‘wow’, especially given the prices.We wouldn’t go out of our way to eat here again
3
Went for the surprise lunch menu and was really surprised - it was thai inspired! It was a European take on Asian food though, and the flavours, though refined, were muted. The restaurant deco was nice and befitting of a venue in marina bay sands. However, the service level could be improved. It felt like the service staff were subtly chasing us away. (maybe we didn't dress "high class" enough?) Dessert was also served even before we finished our main course?! For real Asian flavours, I would say go to somewhere fully Asian.
1
Had the power lunch with friends. Waited 45mins for food to be served and the mains were incorrect and also short of 1. Had to ask several times for the missing order and waited another 25mins. Food tasted bland, service was decent until the bill came. Waiter looks on disapprovingly and walked off with an attitude. Will skip this place
5
We arrived at this restaurant at 6.30pm on a Saturday night without a booking and they were very accommodating in providing us with a good table. The only difficulty we had upon arrival was the volume of the background music, but as it was a Saturday night we felt we could cope OK. My dining companions decided to order the six course set menu which consisted of smaller helpings in each of the courses, dishes included tuna tartar, followed by a salad, a scallops dish, pork, halibut and finally a very interesting dessert. I opted for a la carte starting with Carrot Soup which was 5-star, followed by Santa Monica Market Tomatoes – a salad incorporating several different colour/types of tomatoes in what tasted like a vinaigrette dressing. Main course was Soboro Rice, consisting of steamed rice together with chicken, wakame, radish and togarashi. A really tasty dish and by then I felt too full for dessert. Everyone was happy with their choices and after the first rather raucous background song, things quietened down on the music front and we didn’t have to continue communicating with each other via semaphore. Service at this restaurant was superb. The staff were very friendly, attentive and obliging, our waitress was delightful. The restaurant itself is very clean and beautifully presented. Seeing as it was a weekend night we considered we did well to get in somewhere decent so quickly. Would have no hesitation in recommending
5
Ambience was great lunch deal was superb. Service was great. What more can we ask for. I really do not know.
5
I had a bday dinner at Adrift. everything is perfect , the food was very delicious especially the King Crab Melt ( must try) and also for the drink was super cool! Staff are friendly and helpful. Overall 10/10 !
1
menu needs to be revamped big time. very little to choose from, bad food and overrated. not heading back.
3
Everything about this place is average. Nothing special but nothing bad. Probably won't be back intentionally but if I had to come back I would be indifferent about it. Decent food and drinks. Little overpriced for what you get.
4
Thumbs up for the iberico pork shop chop as it was juicy n tender. Will definitely pop by there again
5
We had our daily breakfast in this beautiful restaurant situated at the lobby level of the hotel. Although we are vegetarian from India, and this restaurant serves only continental and Chinese breakfast food, it was preferred by us for its environs and the service.
5
On the grind floor, of the hotel, sort of hidden unless you pay close attention.What a great place: we had supper there one evening and the food and service was top notch.The bar is a fun viby place with great staff who clearly enjoy there jobs. We made a point go popping in there before going out in the evenings
2
This place is a complete miss. The breakfast is decent, but lunch and dinner are really not worth the time. There's a great food court 10 minutes away that will completely out do this place. The crowd here gets sleazy after midnight. lots of tourist and expats trying to pickup up domestic helpers...should just call it Brix V
5
Our waitress was very friendly and it was nice to talk with her. She recommended what to eat and drink. Restaurant was beautifully decorated and has nice atmosphere. The food was just amazing. You have discount from the bill if you are guest of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. I recommend this restaurant
5
We had the Power set lunch at $ 19++. For my set, I had the seafood glass noodles (Korean dish) as the appetiser and the seabass in laksa sauce as the main. We had expected the portions to be tiny in the set lunch, but they weren't too bad! Even the appetiser might have appeared to be the main dish! Overall, the dishes were well executed, would definitely come back given the value of the meal. The desert (berry meringue) were just macarons you could eat as takeaway as they came in a bag...
4
Great vibes, great ambiance. Modern food. Great set up. Love the sharing dishes where we can sample everything. The savory dishes were great but the desserts felt short.
4
has a lot of drinks deal i really like it, cocktail is nice and also the wine.
food is goes well with the drinks, fried potato, chicken karaaage all nice.
service also nice
4
Was there for a business lunch and was great. Good food and service and a hefty price. Overall a good experience and will return again.
5
Loved, loved, loved the 80's music! The food was unpretentious and so delicious. And had the best service ever!
5
Best wine selection, great service from their knowledgeable bartenders.
Came here every night from our stay at the hotel and left satisfied all the time.
4
Ambience and Service was Excellent . Food could be have been better,ordered the Maine Lobster Dumplings but was terribly bland and salty .
3
I give it credit for their service and great ambience. As for the food, maybe we should have chosen specific dishes rather than being overly adventurous and choice the timeless set. Under this, a 6 course meal is being prepared by the chef not knowing what we will be served. Out of the 6, only 3 were really good, it wasn't outstanding. As for pricing I felt it was quite pricey. Out of 3 people our bill was $406++. Well at least I gave it a try.
5
let's start from the ambiance, really very nice and very cool design. I was on my own so I had dinner in the bar/lounge area. Great music and staff is best one I have experienced in Singapore. When it comes to the food, the menu is really simple and original. A fusion between California and Japanese cuisine. The best meat I have eaten in a while, especially the beef tartare. A must try if you are in Singapore
5
Visited here on a Tuesday evening , there was a lively atmosphere and the 80s soundtrack was fab . Service was absolutely outstanding- this place has really got it right - service is friendly , engaging and helpful. Our food was great the crab melt sandwich is genius- simple concept with amazing taste. Loved the lamb chops and expresso martini was spot on. Great cocktail and wine list . Brilliantly place for either a celebration or fun night out with friends .
3
After checking in the hotel, the Wagyu burger by Adrift was heavily advertised in the lift's TV. Being a burger and wagyu lover, I couldn't skip this. Went for a late night supper at about 11pm.The starters were a surprising pleasant. However, I was truly saddened as I got to eat the Wagyu burger that I was so looking forward to. It was unfortunately a very dry patty. Maybe the meat choice was not suitable to make burgers and the wagyu aroma was totally masked by the Jalapeno and cheese. As I sadly finish the burger, I think they should think about removing this menu from the list. It was a real sad burger.The other thing I tried was: Black Caviar & Sea Urchin. The caviar was excellent! YUM! But the Sea Urchin had a not-so-fresh taste. I would advise people to steer clear of that or take a chance
5
Look for Mr V, by the bar of course. Will amaze u, haven't try the food yet. Service by bar awesome......
5
Great fusion of Western and Asian cuisine. The iberico pork chop course as part of the set meal was delicious, and would also recommend it as an a la carte :)!
4
Did not have a meal but the bar area was very nice. The drinks a bit expensive but all drinks in Singapore are expensive.
5
Great dining experience. Nice and cozy ambiance. Great service by the staff. Staff are knowledgeable and service was tip top. Food was prompt and served at the right timing. Overall awesome dinner for me
3
This place was OK, but we didn't really find food that we enjoyed. There was definitely not the variety that other nearby restaurants offered for the same price. Well suited for the local population, but not so suited for international travelers.
5
Adrift has an excellent buffet breakfast in comparison to other restaurants in Marina Bay Sands because it offers soy milk and steamed soy dessert. Plenty of Asian and Western breakfast choices. It is spacious and easy to move around to get food. However for the price of SGD 52 inclusive of tax, I would expect freshly- made smoothies, impeccable quality of fruits (some days the honey dew and cantaloupe melons were bland), table service and a better choice of music suitable to early hours of the mornings
5
Went there: with a friend, for dinnerI was expecting: a very fancy place & high prices And I found: great staff, reasonable prices and some drinks on the house +++ (PROS)- the lighting was elegantly arranged, offering the place not too much light but enough to chat with the person in front of you and look around- good music for my taste - lounge music but a bit more lively- fantastic OYSTERS!- complimentary champagne: don't know if we were lucky or that happens all the time - so be careful what you expect :) - - - (CONS)- a bit disappointed by the smaller-than-expected glass of Japanese black beer; probably around 300ml (S$16)Bottom line: It's a beautiful place for a chat in the evening. Even though it was a Saturday evening, the place was not too crowded (at least at the back tables) Oh, and I want to thank MARTIN for the great service and good chat we had while I was waiting for my friend. Chatty, funny and attentive - all of it while being natural and attending other guests as well. I felt great
4
When there for lunch. Moment I walked in The restaurant decor took my attention as it is a nice setting. Wasn't feeling too hungry so we ordered the Japanese rice with pickles, mince fried chicken and onsen egg.... it may look simple but once you mix everything together its delicious and comforting Also had the lobster dumpling... wish it came with more of the delicious broth Had the burger too... it was good like many other expensive burgers out there.The have a great selection of red wines to choose from so great for those who enjoy dining with a glass of red wine.
4
We celebrated our anniversary at Adrift. Service was immaculate, however food did not quite meet our expectations. The food was tasty, but preparation was slightly flawed. We ordered the halibut and it was over cooked. The yuzu cheesecake was too tart and the crust was soggy. However, the other dishes we ordered were great
4
I fell in love with Adrift on my first visit half a year ago, and decided to try the weekend brunch buffet, to take advantage of the extended Singapore Restaurant Week offer ($58++ instead of the usual $88++). The buffet spread was decent – just enough for variety, yet not so wide as to make a must-try-everything patron overly stuffed. The quality of the food at the buffet counters was remarkable – flavourful and with the right textures, definitely a cut above the run-of-the-mill buffets. What did not work so well were the dishes served table-side. While this service was a welcome touch, we found most of them too fried, and after a few pieces it became somewhat cloying. Perhaps fewer fried dishes and more of other options would have made the buffet experience perfect.
4
Nothing but good to say about this restaurant. We went for dinner and it was just excellent. I would recommend going when at the hotel
5
Fresh & delicious whole foods
Should have taken pic of the Adrift Eggs Benedict ..
Definitely going back for more.
Everything was good ! unlike some buffets that you must pick & choose.. limited to just several favourites.
5
Amazing atmosphere, good food and great service. I was very impressed that the manager remembered us from a while back.
4
Interesting dishes served in small plates, which means you can try a lot of different types of dishes. There’s the Iberico Pork Chop, poached Alaskan halibut and more.
4
While waiting for our room in the Marina Bays Sands we wandered over to Adrift. Where we received a warm welcome and a fantastic margarita and cosmopolitan. This kicked off our wonderful stay at MBS. After the cocktails we went into the restaurant which has a very cool feel to it. The bubbles, food and service was perfect - Thank you.
5
We had a small group dinner in the back room after a business meeting. The experience was exceptional. It really does begin with exceptional service and we where overwhelmed by the attentive staff who never let our glasses empty, constantly ensured out satisfaction with our selection.But of course, it was the kitchen that starred. Each of us were delighted with our selections. Pork, steak, small plates and of course dessert all were enjoyed
4
Nice place on the ground floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The atmosphere was good, in terms of the decor, and the location is convenient for guests and visitors. The service at the networking event that I attended was first class and the finger food was top quality. However, in terms of effective networking, two issues prevented me awarding 5 stars and I would ideally have awarded a 3.5 if possible. One issue was that the lighting was so dim that it was hard to see what we were eating and eyeball conversation was 'discreet' to say the least. The other was the very loud music, which the networking organisers told me had already been turned down at their request before I arrived. When you can't hear what your group, standing at very small tables, is saying, the purpose of networking is defeated. A bit more light and a lot less noise would deserve five stars
3
We had two breakfasts here - service was ok but we found the breakfast buffet very limited. Some sliced bread and condiments, a few hot choice (beans, sausages) one chef doing eggs do s bit of a line up. Highlight was the little dumplings which were great. Not so great - uncensored Kanye West blaring out the speakers at 7am in the morning. After a few too many F Bombs...suggested to manage my that it was probably not appropriate for young families at breakfast time
5
Had to get some lunch whilst waiting to check-in to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Adrift has a lovely atmosphere, but best of all the staff and food are excellent. Neil kept an eye on our progress and was a mine of information for our forthcoming stay in Singapore. Can highly recommend
5
Went here on Saturday night with a friend of ours, as we were recommended to come here for good drinks. We had all different kind of drinks and all of them were all awesome and interesting! It's definitely a pricey drinks but you get to have really yummy drinks and watching the mixologist/bartender making your drinks with such passion is just a great experience
5
Excellent service, always checking with me by my name. Received complementary champagne and the pork chop was great.
4
Had a really good breakfast here while staying at Marina Bay...good selection buffet style with everything well cooked, coffee was good too...would recommend
5
This was 2nd time to visit this restaurant. All food are so nice, sophisticated. Some stuff were friendly.
I think this restaurant is better than the bar near poolside totally. not too loud music and nice mood as well.
I love this restaurant's salmon grill.
5
Timeless set was worth it and service was very accommodating, changing the menu for those with dietary restrictions
4
Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend, great experience good menu with great food. the service was excellent and a great atmosphere.
4
Staff were generally attentive and service was fast. Iberico pork chop was not bad but a tad salty. Tried onion rings and one of the seafood mains. Portion was reasonable and tasted decent.
4
Great food and lovely staff. Had a birthday dinner there and staff arranged for a surprise dessert. Nice casual ambience, great for families and romantic night outs.
4
Adrift continues to be excellent, but....The dining room is cozy, but a ted too dark and expensive.Menu could have a little more to offer, although is serves well what it serves.Service is excellent, as usual. Top class.Will be back to the bar for sure
4
We chose to dine here whilst staying in Marina Bay Sands after not meeting the dress code for other fine dining restaurants in the hotel. I'm so glad we found this gem.We booked a table two hours prior, they had no trouble fitting us in even with this being a popular celebrity restaurant. The staff were lovely and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, food and ingredients.We had ordered and had been served within 20 minutes with 5* food that was cooked to perfection. I chose the buttermilk chicken with Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. It was absolutely divine!!! The only constructive criticism I could give would be that the staff are a little on top of each other, we were asked by 2 members of staff if we would like to order drinks after already placing our order. This was no problem though and it was nice to be so well looked after (especially by MJ!) 10/10 would recommend!

Five of us had dinner there recently. The restaurant had a charming ambience, great food made for sharing, and good service. Everything we ordered was delicious. The cuisine is Western with a notable Japanese influence. Particularly nice - the iberico pork chop, pumpkin gnocchi, furikake with big eye tuna, crab melt
5
Went for an anniversary dinner and it was one of the best dining experience I had in awhile. Food was great and the service was really beyond expectations. Going back again to try the rest of the menu.
5
Staff was extra friendly and professional. Mood of the restaurant was very relaxing and intimate. Food was glorious. Thank you for the great experience
5
Fantastic service, friendly staff, interesting cocktails and fabulous food in a great setting make this a great place to visit.
4
Try the set menu, it's good
Taste just right
Just wonder if they could volume down the music, kinda ruin the atmosphere
5
We had a great night here. The cocktails were lovely and one Smokey something? Can't remember the name, was amazingly presented.
All meals in our group were faultless.
The restaurant is expensive but we think, worth it.
4
Nothing really special, not a bad place to hang out a bit and have a couple of drinks. I wouldn't like to stay there for dinner or some big meal though. The place lacks class and is definitely overrated. The service is not too hospitable either
4
Lounge out and enjoy some drinks & snacks at Adrift. It's better for smaller groups and high on service. The small plates are quite nice and the menu is varied. It's a place to hang but with someone intimate. We went with a group so it was quite cluttered.
5
The ambience is amazing. Prompt service and great attitude of all staffs. I am very into my cocktails and I can say it's one of the best I have tasted. Visited on a Friday night and I can it's quite busy but nonethless, everyone is on their feet making us feel very attended to

The restaurant ambience at ADRIFT by David Myers is rather cosy, with good lighting streaming in from their large floor-to-ceiling windows.For a Celebrity Chef restaurant, they have a value for money 2 course Prix Fix lunch set for $48++. This is a steal as their a-la carte dishes for dinner are pricey.Enjoyed their delicious wagyu burger which was hearty and juicy, served with chunky fries. Dessert was caramel french toast with coconut sorbet and kopi syrup.Service is friendly, and efficient.Hence, it was rather full for a weekday lunch.Their cuisine style is Californian.Call them to check on any latest set lunches or promotions.HelenSingapor

Booked this for a Christmas Day dinner at 6pm and was surprised to learn that they are serving the regular dinner menu. Have always wanted to try this and it seems the dinner menu pricing is rather reasonable.Service was excellent throughout the evening - attentive and efficient and very smiley. The only glitch was the the sommelier who was asked to speak to us after we asked about the bottle promotion where they had 50 bottles of wine at $50 each (usually reserved for Thursdays only) - immediately he tried to say oh this is xmas day so lets look at something more special ie more expensive etc. Not that we can't afford but don't be a judgemntal sommelir perhaps?In the end, we picked the Anna de CodornÃ­u Blanc de Blancs @ $50 - excellent value at $50 for a Spanish cava. Really nice bubbles. Home made rice crackers (complimentary) - these was really good! Brown and white rice crackers with an accompanying aoli dip. They serve bread too upon request. But maybe I overdosed a little haha. Black pepper river crabs ($8) - this was realy interesting - I wasn't sure if I should be eating them whole like a snack. But the combination turned out to be not too bad, although a little too salty for my liking. Good value though. Heirloom tomato and smoked mackeral ($17) - This was middling as the dish came with butterhead lettuce and the tomatoes were only average. The mackeral was full of tiny bones so I couldnt even finish my first dish correctly. Avoid this hazardous dish.Cumin roasted carrots and avocado ($16) - this was my fav starter (dish) of the night! The cumin added a nice flavour to the carrots, and the avocado was fresh. The bed of farro beneath it were very good too.Brussel Sprouts ($14) - I like brussel sprouts in general but maybe not when it is diced up so small. Flavour wise was okay but thankfully they were not overcooked. Mussels, Razor clams, Crabs ($28) - my main for the evening. The staff said they ran out of mussels and the chef is replacing the necessary with oysters and scallops and prawns. A pretty good deal I must say. The tomato miso broth turned out to be really strangely creamy and I couldnt finish it. BBQ Colorado Lamb Loin ($44) - not my dish but was told it was not too bad but 3 racks was really generous for the portion.Will definitely return! :)

Food is excellent. Pork chop and French toast is highly recommended. Service was superb. Staff are attentive and helpful.
4
Great location, no views but who cares. The food is good and sitting here is extremely relaxing. Love it.
5
All good, from the food to the bar selection, and very inspiring spirits & wine list. Love the place, the atmosphere and the style !
5
Visited before the theatre and will definitely be coming back. Friendly staff, great food and love the setting & music.
4
It is a very formal dining setup. More popular for dinner and lunch. Has a great bar and lots of selection. Be prepared to pay top dollars. Not much for the vegetarian.
4
We ordered the burger, sashimi and seeet potato and felt that the sweet potato had too much sauce on it. The rest of the dishes were good. Staff were courteous but we had a little trouble trying to get their attention while asking for the bill

We were looking for a casual, but refined Sunday lunch that was not overrun with children playing or adults trying to as much as their money was worth, or preferably more and I'm happy to report that Adrift was just the ticket. A well curated starter buffet allows you to taste a little of everything and still have room for mains and David Meyer curates his buffet very well indeed. A great selection of cold cuts and cheeses (think Bellota, Chorizo, Lomo), a mountain of ice replete with oysters you want to go back for (none of that frozen on the half shell rubbish), scallops so expertly poached they are as tender as they should, beautiful tuna tartare, fresh (of course fresh!) and inventive salads. Now, I don't know about you, but I am always worried at semi buffets when I order mains Ã  la carte. They often seem thrown together by the least experienced commis in the kitchen, so I'm not sure what possessed me when I ordered grilled tuna steak. But I'm glad it did, because this was one of only three good tuna steaks I have had in my life (none of the previous ones in Asia). Juicy, meaty, smoky, so tasty it brought tears to my eyes. Tears of joy!The only thing I could not understand was why there were so few people in the restaurant. This is without doubt one of the top Sunday Brunch experiences in Singapore and at S$ 88 a pop, it's a steal.
5
This is the best place to go in Singapore! Don't miss it. Put it on your list! Great food. I mean really good. You can eat a wonderful dinner then go and enjoy a drink at the bar. Or vice versa. And the bar area is a fun place to sit, listen to music and enjoy some chat time and cocktails. Totally awesome cocktails. All the staff are fabulous and fun. DO NOT miss it
4
We had a lovely dinner here while staying at the Hotel. Steak as cooked to perfection as was the lamb. Would have been good to have a kids menu but in any case they chose from menu and had the slider burgers. We were lucky it was not a busy night and service was very good unlike brekky where timing to get a coffee or tea is painfully slow - even as the first arrivals for the morning! Otherwise breakfast was lovely
2
Dined here as part of the Singapore Restaurant Week, but I am disappointed to report that it was well and truly below par. Started with tuna tartare which was served with absolutely no seasoning or even a hint of acidity. We had to request lime, salt and pepper and each of these items came to us at a different time and we had to wait long periods in between. Add to this that we also asked for some more rice crackers to go with tuna and were nearly done by the time this was brought. Main was a miso glazed pork chop, which was nice enough. This came served with tiny brussels sprouts and a slice of apple. The coconut poached fish was a far better dish though.Dessert options were a black pepper mille feuille (unusual but again, not exceptional) and a chocolate fritter. The latter was overly spiced - so much so, that a table of three chocolate-loving ladies took one bite each and left the rest. The flavours were overpowering - there was a lot of crystalised ginger on the plate and strong hit of cardamom and possibly cloves in the chocolate. We really felt that the service to our table and the food was not of standard possibly because we were Restaurant Week diners, which is completely the wrong attitude as we will not be returning or recommending this restaurant. The experience was not pleasant
5
The food was delicious. Fast and friendly service. Next visit everyone wants their own order of the crab melt! Looking forward to dining here again soon!
5
Decently priced cocktails & food with awesome service! You should try their creative mixes of cocktails (had the penicillin cocktail). The staffs were professionally accommodating.
5
Enjoyed the service and food (Jebron and Martin). They took care of us, give the tight timing to eat and catch Wicked at MBS. We enjoyed the food and would definitely like to eat at Adrift again, and spend more time there. Thanks.
4
its a splendid experience n food quality are defininetly great. love the ambience and service where every staff greet customer by heart. very heart warming place
4
My friend and I went to MBS to catch a show and booked a table at Adrift for pre-show dinner. The menu list consists mainly protein and fibre, and I was worried if that would be adequate, even though I am not a big eater. First came some complementary crackers, and the starter of carrot and avocado was served with farro (some wheat grains), so that was rather filling. The tiger prawn main course consists of 2 reasonably sized prawns roasted at the right juicy tenderness. The serve was quick but not rushed, and we still had time for dessert before the show
5
This is one of the best places to be for a drink and good food in Singapore.Your check will scare you at the end of the night so make sure you drink just enough to ease the pain at the end.Let the barman go wild and give him a hint of what you like. Let him create something for you at the spot. There's no going wrong.Music and lighting spot on. Great cozy corner for a happy hour.Service is top notch. It's a must try.I can't wait to go back
5
My daughter and I have been longing to dine at Adrift after my best friend has told me of her wonderful experience there with her husband and kids during her family vacation to Singapore. We went in early October for lunch and although the menu is different from what my girlfriend has described, the food we ordered was delicious made with high quality ingredients, while portion and presentation was also very good.Staffs were highly attentive and service was excellent. We would definitely dine again at Adrift next time we visit Singapore!
5
Absolutely stunning restaurant and bar. Had been at the bar before and knew it was good! So arrived 30 minutes before our reservation for dinner. What a wonderful selection of whiskeys - Scottish single malt, American or Japanese - pages to chose from. They had my favourite Toshi Three Woods - went down so nicely!!! Things to remember at this restaurant is that there is a special 2 for 1 deal on whiskeys on a Wednesday evening and on Thursday there is a varied selection of wines all reduced to $50 per bottle - cheap by Singapore standards. Don't forget to make your reservation because this restaurant becomes very busy.Then on to dinner!Magnificent choice! There is a very nice seafood sharing starter good for two or three people which we chose. The main I chose the rib of beef which was cooked to perfection. I asked chef if he could add a slice of foir gras which he gladly did for a small additional charge. The vegetable was a giant tomato slice in half and grilled with cheese and breadcrumbs- Devine!! In fact the tomato was almost as big as the steak - massive.Great selection of desserts - all look mouthwatering.There is also a good selection of beers including some novel ones.Wifi and air conditioning all working excellently. waiters and waitresses all super attentive. Loved this restaurant and would come back anytime. Collect points on the hotels loyalty card - if you don't have one register and receive the card immediately at Tower 3 MBS Assistance.

If you are looking for screwing up your day than you should try this restaurant, Very Average food with pathetic service. Highly priced, with most disgusting and unprofessional General Manager called "Jibran", he tries to prove himself right in every way without listening or taking any feed back from their customers. I would recommend to fire restaurant manager. Nothing positiv to mention, except the clean air and the fantastic view

My wife and I had a very enjoyable Sunday Brunch here a year ago, and we were very much looking forward to introducing our children to this restaurant (particularly because they are major karaage aficionados, and the karaage that we had had was excellent), and also to hosting lunch for her uncle and his familyFirst, and foremost, we were rather taken aback to be told that the brunch format which was stated clearly in the online menu had changed significantly, and that instead of being able to select a main course, there was going to be a selection of main courses served as small plates on a trolley which would be wheeled out throughout the lunch - akin to dim sum?This would be well and good if a) the portions were more than a bite, b) the trolley came out in a more timely manner, and c) the dishes were as represented in the menu.The first major disappointment was to find that the Wagyu slider (as represented by the manager) was most certainly not Wagyu, and even worse, the patties were uniformly dry and brittle.The karaage on waffle was tasty, but being wheeled around in an air-conditioned room, meant that the chicken and mini waffles were lukewarmwhen I mentioned that the crab omelette was not served, to his credit the manager immediately ordered a couple for us, but we were shocked to see that crab sticks had been used!However, what really was incredibly galling was the fact that the waitresses were determined to ensure that we consumed as much San Pellegrino as possible, perpetually filling our glasses after each sip, and - the final straw - even opening a bottle without asking us!This smacks of a lack of integrity, as well as a very cynical approach to service.The fact that the manager informed us that we would not be charged for the bottle of water, didn't really mitigate the horrible attitudeThis was in marked contrast to our dinner at Odette's the night before, where one didn't feel that the restaurant's profit margin depended on the consumption of mineral water.We were told when we called for the bill that manager had been instructed by his immediate superior not to bill us, and even when I insisted upon paying, he wouldn't allow me to - I was very sincere about paying, as I do not believe in free meals, and actually enjoy paying for a good meal.The final salt in the wound - I insisted upon leaving a decent tip for the waitresses, only to be chastised by my son and daughter later: it seems that when I was expressing my displeasure to the manager, the waitresses were making snide remarks about our table - my children didn't tell me then as they knew I would have totally flipped my lid.NB:A. I didn't partake of the cold shellfish in the buffet due to my allergies, but my children told me that crab and oysters were superbB. the restaurant manager is an extremely personable chap, and seemed very genuine about attending to our criticism
5
Excellent dinner at Adrift. Staff were friendly and attentive. They even told me that I was entitled to a discount. The Caramel French Toast was the best part of the meal!
4
A treat for the palate. The food was amazing and the service also. Enjoyed the ensemble of different flavours that combined perfectly to give an amazing treat.
4
It was a very enjoyable dining experience! Good quality food with impeccable service. This is a restaurant that I will certainly return to again.
3
I recently ate breakfast at this restaurant not realising it was a buffet. I found the place via a food review site and was expecting an a la carte menu. My bad I guess but even for a buffet breakfast, the food was average and not worth the price in my opinion.On the plus side, the Chai Latte was very good
3
Ordered crab meat sandwiches and that was good but nothing extraordinary. Then we ordered lamb, and it was fabulous! Plus two alcoholic beverages the bill was around S$150. Good decor makes up for a lot. Service not professional, they did not greet me by name tho I made a reservation, and scanty when needed. Food and decor good enough to be fine dining but service staff drops it down two notches in my book
5
We had an amazing dinner here during our star at MBS.The service, food and drinks were all amazing. We retired to the bar after enjoying a fabulous meal where we were entertained and treated to some delicious cocktails by the very attentive staff, a true credit to David Myers.The service was very professional yet friendly. A great place to enjoy a nice meal with friends/family. We will be returning
4
I'm here on business trip. Our host has the whole main section of the restaurant for us. I love this very casual atmosphere and super friendly service. It's not an easy task to handle 50 guests at the same time. The staff had been doing their best serving our needs. Food is quite good. I didn't stay for the drinking and mingling at the bar which I think is probably the best part for the evening
5
Rubin is by far the best bartender we have ever found in Singapore. He actually listens to what you like and don't like and will make you a custom drink accordingly. He is very sweet and his attitude is contagious to the other people there. There is always a happy atmosphere in the bar area. There is always someone to talk to and laugh with at the bar and the drinks are reasonably priced for Singapore standards.
5
Our friends living in Singa invited us for a drink there and we ended up having a great time, Reuben, the bar tender is great and can customize your drinks just with a couple of questions...he is like a drink whisperer! I didn't try the restaurant though.
1
We always visit around F1 time and the restaurant and bar is at least consistent.... That is consistently awful... Why did we go back you may be saying, if it was so bad last time? ... Well we just couldn't believe it could be that bad again...it was!Awful service, the 3 bottles of wine we chose were out of stock, they forgot the food order, chaotic service and no management, ridiculously over priced even for Singapore... I could go on.... Just awful! Give it a miss there are much better places to go to in Singapore
5
From the quality of ingredients to the cocktails and wine selection to the great service (which is often difficult to come by in Singapore), this restaurant always delivers. We have come back here three times and will be back for more.
5
Don't think about the view, nothing about it, but think about a good nice place for a perfect cocktail, it's all about passion and the way of making it. Old fashion & Mojito the best in town🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
4
Beautiful restaurant. Nicer when dimmer. Good buzz. Food is delicious, small though. Prefer when restaurant is more full.
5
Went for lunch with friends and had their business luncheon set. Food were just simply amazing. Service was great and sincere. Will be back again.
5
Food was extraordinary. very nicely executed and presented. Chef paid a lot of attention to details in the dishes. Chef David even came by to greet us, a very lovely gesture indeed! Overall, a very satisfying meal.
5
Walking through the shoppes shpoing mall at marina bay sands we saw this bar within the mall. We were looking for a place to relax a bit and were greeted at the entrance where they told us about the actual offer. The menu has a great variety of drinks for all. A small list of snacks are also available. I can recommend the cheese and charcurturie platter. The place itself has a real cosy atmosphere and just leads you to stay and enjoy the time either alone, with friends and family or business partners. The music is a great mix of different types of genres and not necessarily main stream. The staff is really friendly and competent.This is a great place to visi
5
One of the Marina Bay Sands 'Celebrity Restaurants', Adrift lives up to expectations.The restaurant concept is based on the use of Japanese ingredients for European inspired cuisine, and it works a treat. The iberico pork chop in particular was spectacular , a certain challenger to steaks sold nearby. The complimentary sake and spices based cocktail offered on arrival is also memorable, as was our encounter with David Myers himself , who greeted diners toward the end of the evening.Service was attentive and courteous, and overall price reasonable compared to similar quality establishments. Highly recommended - if ever in Singapore again, I would certainly return
4
1st time here the place is bit packed perhaps due to the event. free wagyu burger with any alcohol drink. we ordered our food and then they got us a table further inside the restaurant. we had a cold octopus dish as starter, mini crab spaghetti and lastly our drool yum wagyu burgers!~ :
5
I've been there a few times and had never been disappointed.Chef William, Restaurant Manager, Bar Manager - Anand and "Tom Cruise"(forgot his name) had been really lovely, ensuring that customers have nothing to complain about -- and truly we do not have anything to complain.If you do not have too much time in Singapore, and one restaurant & bar you need to visit, this is it!A lovely place to chill and end my week in for sure. Everything's easy there. You only need to ask...... :-
5
went there with friends for sunday brunch. this place has great service, good ambiance, great seafood brunch... the alakan king crab legs are absolutly delicious. they refill the seafood quantity all the time, unlike some other places, leaving buffet trays and areas empty. THe place is not crowded, because of the open space. Service from waiters / manager A+. The price is extremely reasonable at 88$. The only downside was the 70$ supplement if you choose to have free flow alcohol which I find to be way overpriced. Thus we didnt opt for that. The main course / dessert was average, but at this stage you are so full already from the seafood buffet, and its really the highlight of the sunday brunch
5
We went to Adrift for lunch based on Trip Advisor research.
The food was wonderful, staff attentive and knowledgeable and the setting was very pleasant. Don't be put off by the hotel lobby location, it's another world inside.
We loved it!
5
We stumbled upon Adrift after meeting their manager in front of the restaurant after we asked him for directions to Gardens by the Bay. We were staying at another hotel across the bay and had no intentions eating at Marina Bay Sands but when we met the sharp GM from New York, we felt a good energy and initially were simply going to have a drink after the light show. He and the entire team made us feel so welcomed and the cocktails were down right extraordinary, (best Singapore sling, sorry Raffles) that we had to stay for dinner. Definitely one of the best dinners we have had in Singapore. The pork neck and Kagoshima steak were top notch. We also loved the chilled crab dish, carpaccio and the beautiful lobster tail! The restaurant was beyond fun and it was the highlight of our trip! That same manager even walked us up to Spago on the roof to see the view and be even more spoiled
5
Gotta love one of those places where they top up your free flow cocktail before you run out! We had the brunch buffet which has a seafood on ice spread, salads, ham and fruits and with a choice of main course and dessert. Granted the selection wasn't large but it's all about quality over quantity.
5
As usual amazing cocktails and bar bites .. The food was spot on as was the service !! Chef mark was gracious in his kitchen .. The french toast was amazing !! Recommended as a unique concept restaurant Even in the very busy restaurant scene of Marina bay Sands !!! #marinabaysands #classicfood #adriftbydavidmyers
5
We came across Adrift after visiting one of the rooftop bars at Marina Bay. The staff were so inviting, knowledgable of the menu and very friendly. Our meal was very tasty and the wine went down a treat. Would definitely recommend the steak! A visit is a must if going to Singapore. It's money well spent.
5
My friend and I stayed just one night at Marina Bay Sands to see what all the hype was about. We studied hotel management and were interested in observing not only the hotel operations but also the restaurants. We gave Adrift a shot after drooling over the menu. We were given a lovely table by the windows in the back corner, sitting on two very trendy suspended couches. Very cool. We tried six courses, and managed to swing down about four cocktails. The staff were incredibly attentive and the show was seamless from course to course. The service was flawless. The chili crab in toasted bread with jalapeÃ±os was to die for. We also had some sort of pork loin that was seared to perfection. Sometimes pork can get dry and tough; this might have been the best presentation of pork I have ever had. The staff brought us a "gift from the team"-- a marvelously crafted tequila cocktail. We loved it. Would recommend not only to hotel guests but to anyone in Singapore looking for a remarkable dining experience.
4
Lovely place with nice decor and ambience, great service by our server MJ! We ordered the Iberico Pork Chop, Wagyu Burger, Suzuki Fish, Maine Lobster, Hanger Steak, King Oyster Mushrooms, Asparagus, Baby Spinach Salad in varying sizes for the 5 of us to share. The star was definitely hands down the Iberico Pork(only served during dinner), we all loved the flavour and the tenderness! Oyster Mushrooms, Spinach Salad and Maine Lobster were good too. We felt that the signature Wagyu Burger, Suzuki Fish, Hanger Steak, Asparagus were okay, but there wasn't anything too special about them in particular. Overall a great experience, will definitely come back for the pork!!
5
I had lunch at Adrift with a few colleagues. The decor is calm and soothing and immediately puts you in a good mood. The cutlery is some of the best i've seen in Singapore. And the food's great as is the service. I had the set lunch ($38 i think). I picked the quinoa salad and the wagyu cheeseburger. Both great. I heard it gets quite packed for dinner but lunch is a great idea
5
If you are looking for a place to have a relaxing lunch, Adrift is the right choice. Sitting on a swing like couches, enjoying lunch set and ordering several ala carte signature menu is the way to go!Do try their Oysters... King crab melt Lobster Rolls - and their cocktails ...
5
Located smack in the middle of the Marina Bay Sands lobby I was apprehensive, to say the least, expecting a formulaic celebrity restaurant. Instead, swings at the tables, interesting menu options including unique, non-mushroom ((yay)) fish & vegetarian options for me and Waygu beef for my carnivorous spouse, and an evening that felt less like dinner for two in the hotel restaurant and more like a cocktail party where your host lives to show everyone a good time.  We booked last minute for a mid-week parent-escape date night for dinner before seeing UB40 at the Grand Theatre at Marina Bay Sands. When they learned we were seeing a show they speeded up service and kept track of time on our behalf. Cocktails were bespoke & house made. Complimentary apps were sent to our table and both mains brought together, which is a rarity in Singapore.  Staff was overly hovering. I felt like our table was tended over by a hive of bees. To be fair, the interactive dining experience began when we asked our waiter a few questions about cocktails bringing the bar tender over, which then carried on through the meal which was delicious, well seasoned & portioned, and delivered by multiple servers. At the end, when yet another person arrived to ask how our meal was I asked, (mildly exasperated) "And who are you?" Turns out it was chef/owner David Meyers who has a Michelin star at his first restaurant in LA and several other award winning places around the world. He was super-cool and friendly and just happened to be in town checking on his place. And suddenly, just like that, rather than being in the lobby of MBS, we are transported to a village cafe where the chef pulls up a chair and you laugh like old friends.  We made the show in plenty of time. Easily accessible by cab or MRT. Stop in for a cocktail and small plate if you don't have time for dinner
3
Very cozy and nice atmosphere.
But beef steak was so salty and lobster roll cost me 26 bucks only for tiny small 2 pieces.
If i get there, i wouldn't buy those above foods.
It was on average i suppose.
5
The quality of dishes are simply awesome... service staff are attentive with great servicez.... and chefs are super interactive. You will see great effort from chef planning...
4
Had a fantastic meal and the best cocktails. Service was superb also. Can't fault this restaurant. Price for 2 - approx 200 sing dollars.
5
Went with friends in evening. Very welcoming and top end decorations. Very comfortable and relaxing ambience. Lots of choices in menu. Waiters were very helpful with menu and selecting dishes. Food were beautifully presented and delicious. Definitely go back again.
5
My first night in Singapore & decided to grab a quick dinner at Adrift. Ordered the cheese burger which was the best burger I've had in a long time. The wait or brought over free crisps to begin with which was great. The service here is outstanding, and the Singapore slings are great. As we were staying at marina bay sands hotel we did get 30% off the bill - as long as it was charged to the room. Definitely recommend this place
3
Initially, we were a bit put off. We had arrived about 3 minutes before Adrift opened for lunch and we were told to take a walk in the lobby. It was a sweltering day and we just wanted to sit, but the hostess refused to let us wait at table for the few minutes before they actually opened. We had to demand to see a manager and by the time our hostess walked off to find one, the restaurant was opened and a waitress arrived to seat us. Needless to say, this did not set the right mood for a relaxing brunch. While the food wasn't bad and the ambience and actual meal service was good, Adrift still has a way to go before they reach the kind of service one would expect in a five star hotel
5
located inside marina bay with good quality food and the ambiance is amazing yo chill with friends , for a date or a meeting place I highly recommend it thumbs up
5
Wow!!!! This was our second time back at Adrift and they had really gone the extra mile to make it a special occasion! We had some incredible cocktails on arrival and the food itself was of a very high quality and beautifully presented. We were very lucky also to meet Chef David Myers who certainly made us feel welcome! Thank you..!! Our waiter Mark Anthony took full control on what we ordered, what a great decision it was and what a valuable asset to the restaurant he is! All other staff were extremely attentive and helpful. We will CERTAINLY be back soon! thanks for a great night!! One of the best restaurants in Singapore!
3
A rather expensive place for a brunch that does not start until 12.00 and you have a small selection to chose from for main and deserts. The main we ordered was for both of us cold and while they did offer to redo it or something else by then we had lost our appetite
3
My husband and I stopped by to have a drink since it was the the only restaurant we hadn't been to. We met Rubin who was great! He gave us suggestions for night life and even made a special shot for us once he heard we were in Singapore for our honeymoon.If you get the chance to stay at MBS I'd suggest seeking Rubin out
4
Stopped by here a few times for drinks during a conference at the Sands Expo. Really nice selection of drinks. Great service and a nice happy hour in a modern, swanky setting. Would love to try dinner sometime.

3 course lunch meal is reasonably priced
A generous portion of salad
The salmon is very good
Lava Cake is Perfect.
Setting : Private Room
5
The food and the way it was presented are fantastic, atmosphere was pleasant overlooking indoor gardens, serves was excellent, price for two is a bet high but the quality was 5 stars.
3
The service was good and the generally young waitstaff were warm and friendly. As it was a Saturday, they served brunch, with a wide range of offerings including salmon sashimi, smoked salmon, large prawns, crab claws, oysters and scallops. There was also a variety of fruits, such as mangosteens and mangoes, as well as cakes.We had a choice of mains and desserts, most of which were okay to good, though portions were smallish. The steak and eggs were alright, especially the egg which looked sou vide. I went with pancakes and caramelised French toast, both of which were enjoyable. There was a choice of two desserts, one being a chocolate cake with ice cream and the other being a napoleon type cake also with ice cream. Both were okay though not remarkable.We were seated on a couple of couches near the sculpture in the fountains and the floor to ceiling windows let in wonderful light.On a side note, two of us had a bit of a tummyache immediately within the hour after dining here
4
I went for the Saturday brunch during restaurant week. I had several dishes in mind which I wanted to try but still went for the recommended Adrift Benedict which tasted a tad bland and ordinary. The caramel french toast I had for dessert was on the other hand the best french toast I ever had. The super crispy lamb that was served from the trolley was amazing as well. Chef Myers even came to each table to greet us. I was touched with his sincerity and friendliness as we spoke a bit. Service wise could be improved upon as some staff seem uncertain in responding to guests' request. Nonetheless I would still come back for dinner one day

The Singapore Restaurant week is normally a good way to explore a new restaurant and we picked Adrift - a big mistake!!Our table was reserved for 7.45 pm and upon punctual arrival we were asked to wait in the waiting area near the bar. We ordered our wine for dinner. So far, so good.Then we waited....and waited..... No information when table will be ready, no finger food to overcome the growing hunger. After 45 minutes we asked and the waitress assured us that she will check. After almost an hour we got a bowl of chips and we were questioned if we we are okay to eat on the launch table. As shown on the picture, the table was lower than our knees!! FINE DINING at Adrifft!!!!At 09.00 pm, 75 (!!!) minutes later than our reservation and really starving, we finally were offered a free table. The dinner itself was between great (Big Eye Tuna) and okay (Seafood Stew and Beef Tenderloin, both not hot anymore).It was an unforgettable evening - and we will not consider to return to Adrift, neither for business not for private reasons

Hosted a business lunch for 20-25 persons and the entire experience from beginning to end was top notch! A beautiful setting at the back of the restaurant in a private dining room, excellent service and a diverse menu accommodating the dietary needs of all guests (including gluten free). The food was amazing, everyone loved their 3-course meal. Including wine & coffee/tea, the per person average including tax & tip was around $65 SGD. Highly recommend Adift, and will definitely be back for a date night

Me my wife and son booked a table at the Adrift restaurant in the Marina bay sands hotel on the last night of our stay in Singarpore , we wanted a memorable dining experience to finish on, it's a nice place with comfy seating, we had a starter each to wet our appetite , I ordered the Kamagoshi steak, my son the Wagyu burger and my wife the pork chop, we had ordered a plate of hand cut fries as well, pleased we did because my steak was 5oz with a couple of vegetables , my son loved his burger and my wife enjoyed her main, I just felt hungry after spending a lot of money for what I had, what annoyed me most was our waiter, he was at us too much, intruding reallly, when I asked for the bill he brought to our table ,asked if I was paying cash and then proceeded to stand over me until I took out my wallet and counted out the cash, I got the impression he was waiting to see what his tip would be, made me feel uneasy , he picked our wallet up and if I had waited for him to come back with the 25 dollars I would have waited a long time , we just left, I won't dine there again because of the very small portion I had and the intrusive waite

We have had breakfast twice in here and are only rating it as such. They serve a fairly wide selection of standard breakfast and brunch items, some local, traditional items and are done well. A slight annoyance by the staff on both days requesting us to complete the room check at times which are convenient for them and not the diners, interrupting mid-mouthful rather than waiting for the end of the meal. That being said the service is tidy and swift with good grace. Would probably have gone again tomorrow but we are leaving too early for Adrift to be open
3
This bar is one of the most talked about new bars in Singapore, due to the badging of David Myers. But two visits later, I am struggling to see what all the fuss is about - apart from the fact I ran into Gordan Ramsey there recently.The cocktail list is broad, and the cocktails are fabulous.Food is shared plates and bits and pieces, none of which are particularly mind-blowing. I'd have a drink here and eat elsewhere next time.

Had a sumptous dinner with friends at Adrift and the experience was great. Service from the staffs were superb. Food was delicious. Will definitely return here and recommend to my friends too
2
The only reason this place is not getting a "very poor rating" is because of the decent ambience and attentive staff. Other than that, for the price paid for the food, the food was definitely disappointing. Started with the crackers which tasted ordinary to the crab sandwich which probably was the best thing we had that day (but why have crab sandwiches when you get good lobster rolls for around the same price) and then moved to the butter poached lobster risotto which sounds good except the lobster meat was negligible and the grain used for the risotto was not to my taste. The dessert I believe a parfait which was just forgettable. Not worth the money spent when there are plenty of better restaurants out there
5
Couldn't recommend Adrift more. Staff are great and really friendly. The food is delicious, I particularly loved the Pork Tonkatsu sandwich on the lunch menu. From the outside, you can't tell that the setting inside is so open and bright. Floor to ceiling length windows make it a great daytime venue. I've also been back from cocktails. The head bartender is great fun and made the experience really special
4
I was visiting Marina bay sands and first I just passed by this place until a friendly face asked me to come in (don't look so welcoming from outside), but when you come in the atmosphere is nice with friendly staff. Also perfect for small dinner parties for companies where they have separate allocated dinning room
5
Went here for drinks with a friend after dinner nearby. Very friendly and helpful staff, good selection of cocktails and drinks. The popcorn they serve as a bar snack is awesome, even better you can buy it in little bags for takeaway. Also tried the seaweed chips which were different but very tasty. All-in-all, a very pleasant couple of hours spent snacking and drinking

It is the whole package that made this restaurant our TOP Favourite among Singapore fine dining restaurants. The Omakase menu gave us delightful surprises every time we ordered it. The menu changes periodically so regular diners will always have something different to try. The bartender would fix special cocktails to our taste to pair with the food. What a treat. The food is innovative but not pretentious. Not the most elaborate preparations but the dishes are appealing and very enjoyable. Fresh ingredient and elegantly prepared. Celebrity Chef David Myers come and check on the restaurant frequently and personally greet guests. The serving staff are all extremely friendly. We had been regular diners at most of the MBS celebrity restaurants and Adrift is now by far our favourite. This is great for a romantic dinner or a family meal. Very comfortable, bistro type of setting

Being a Celebrity Chef restaurant we were expecting the same quality of food as the rest of the MBS Celebrity Chef outlets at the mall. Food portions are ridiculously small, forcing you to order more dishes just to "Pump" the check average up. The only decent dish was the fried oysters. Well cooked, crispy outside and juicy in the inside.Cocktails were great but not impressive. I tried the penicillin and to be honest, the one at the Manhattan bar is far better. Service and ambiance was the only thing that you could call "Celebrity Chef standard". Kudos for Mark Anthony. He took care of us in every single detail. Unfortunately the wine we ordered from the wine list was out of stock and without anyone or any manager approaching us with a recommendation we decided to skip the wine and just stick to water. If you are looking for a high end restaurant with mediocre food and high prices this is the place, however we all know that nobody wants to waste money in overrated restaurants

Was at Adrift by David Myers last week and it was a pleasant experience!Food and drinks was great (better than what we expected!) Service was prompt, quick and staffs did well with recommendations. King Crab Melts & Lobster Roll is a MUST try! The ambiance and decor was just right for a casual catch up session. Adrift is definitely worth recommending
4
We are just back from a VERY nice dinner at Adrift. The service was flawless, the food outstanding and the dessert to die for(French toast). Our waiter Mark was very nice he provided great service! Well done Adrift, we will be back soon

We were here to celebrate a friend's birthday and i thought why not take a look at Adrift. We were initially complaining about the walk over from carpark and our famous last words were what is californian izakaya. Once we tasted the king crab melt & lobster roll, we were all praise and complimenting the dishes. The service was brilliant, the server introudced himself and gave good advice on whether we ordered enough dishes. On the menu, it also gives an sense of how much to order for 2 pax. They even portion the dishes in 4 pieces because there were four of us. I like the ambience and decor. After the meal, the walk to the carpark wasnt a drag in fact it was a welcome walk to burn of the sinful but delivious calories we accummulated. If you are staying at the mbs, its definitely worth a visit and during lunch they have got set lunches priced starting at sgd$38.

We stayed in Marina Bays Sand for 2015 Countdown.Its quite late and my two teenage sons are hungry. Too lazy to go anywhere, we decided to give Adrift a try, and what a pleasant experience. It was full when we reached and they are very helpful to get us a table after 10 minutes wait. The food menu is simple but they have an extensive drinks menu.My sons order their famous King Crab Melts and Kagoshima Beef. I wasn't hungry, so I just order a drink (Adrift:Mojito)The Chef compliment starter is crackers and its was very light and yummy. The King Crab Melts is very good but the Kagoshima Beef is excellent (My son regretted that he ordered the small portion!). If you have tried Kobe Beef, this is close to that.Later, I found out that Adrift is also well known for their drinks. Kitchen closed at 10:00pm but the bar open till 2:00am.If you are in the area, I recommend you try Adrift

Adrift at the MBS hotel has a weekend brunch at $88++.That comes without any beverages except tapped water. But it was worth it. Highest quality seafod including oysters and lobster. There are salads and breads. Selection was limited but quality was excellent. You get a mains and a dessert alacarte included which you order. The steak and eggs are fantastic and so was the ham and egg crepe. Then there were several side dishes which I understand are changed. For the desserts, the crepe and parfait were heavenly. It was quiet and we had the entire restaurant to ourselves with very attentive and good service
5
Good Food, Great Service. Chef David Myers went out to greet each table, truly made a difference...
5
Can't speak for the bad reviews but great restaurant and good value. We had the chefs plate selection with matching drinks and whilst value is relative, the quality of the food, the fact that there were 7 great courses with matched wines and the general quality of service meant that we thought we had good value and a great meal. A special mention must go to Mark whose service was impeccable.

This restaurant looked promising and has great natural light if you get a window seat at lunch. We liked it enough to have two lunches here though the conclusion in the end was that the food is very average. The king crab melt, the hamachi shabu shabu and rice cakes were competent but underwhelming. The second time we ate here we ordered a a roast chicken dish that looks to have been removed from the menu - a good decision by the restaurant as the chicken was served with its feet on. When we enquired if that was a mistake, we were assured it was the intended presentation. Service could do with some polishing - you will likely get asked in quick succession by different waiters over the course of the meal whether you have ordered/are enjoying your meal/need anything else.If you are happy to have a meal in a pretty looking place with average food, this can be added to the list of ever growing Singapore high end restaurants set up in the same vein
3
Was here for a dinner. Had duck confit gyoza for starters and for mains, we had a spicy beef soup and a iberico pork chop. The restaurant seems to be modeled as a kind of tapas-y type of restaurant.. small dishes to go with drinks and not a place for full fledged dinner. The dishes were all that exciting to the palate and we left feeling meh-ish.
4
The meal was well presented, the staffs were very friendly, and the foods were great as well. However, we found the restaurant a little too dark at times and the service wasn't that fast (while we indicated that we were in a rush). Loved the combination of various seasonal products and nicely decorated seating areas
2
We visited this place during the Resturant Week and had its 3-course set menu at $65(after GST and service). The food was completely uninspiring and the Sake Marinated Salmon was one of the worst I have had - a crime for reputable resturant to service over cooked dried salmon. Don't waste your time if you care for food taste and quality
3
Elegant dÃ©cor, extremely professional service - a rarity these days in Singapore. However, the food is disappointing - good but not brilliant, even the signature dishes like the crab melt or wagyu cheeseburger. I don't want to be insulting, but the burger was no better than the sliders we had in the VIP room at Cirque du Soleil! However, the dessert chef is a star; the signature French toast is yummy, as are many sorbets and ice creams. Reasonable pricing given the location
5
We chose to dine here for our first wedding anniversary and could not praise the service highly enough. MJ looked after us for the evening and he offered some extremely helpful advice on the menu and all round great service. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The space itself is lovely and spacious so it made for an extremely enjoyable experience. We would highly recommend Adrift
5
This resturant in the lobby level of marina bay near second tower is excellent. We enjoyed the food and the service was great.
Even they had some thing similar to Indian papad to go with the drinks.
4
1st visit on a Sunday afternoon and it was quiet with a nice ambience with lots of natural light. Being a furniture enthusiast, appreciated the decor and the furniture choice.
We liked the menu, serving food interpreted in a refreshing manner.
5
Refreshingly different. Great food. Successfully fuses east and west flavors. Did not miss a beat with every dish. Very friendly and attentive service. Certainly a place deserving a follow up visit. We will be back and will certainly recommend to our friends.
5
We came here for our anniversary dinner. The food was - I cant describe. The servers are fast and know a lot about the menu and can suggest anything. We will come back!
5
Really great restaurant inside the Marina Bay Sands, David Myers chef menu has a delicious californian cuisine. Its not cheap, but its incredible for the price you pay, and in Marina bay Sands everything is expensive. Highly recommended

For more reviews and photos, visit my site hungrybaker.coAdrift by celebrity chef David Myers is styled like a restaurant-bar and is said to serve dishes prepared using fresh Californian produce, with Asian inspiration. The grilled yuba with truffle cheese was oily, with a thick, chewy mouthfeel, and delicious.For appetisers, we had the Alaskan King Crab Melt. It was basically a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed generously with crab meat. It was comfort food, elevated.For mains, we had the Wagyu Cheeseburger and Sake-marinated Salmon. My companion loved the wagyu patty but found the buns and wedges not good enough to accompany the patty. The Sake-marinated Salmon was just ok, one of the pieces was a little too blackened around the edges, but I was fine with that. I liked the Romanesco broccoli.For desserts, we both had the Vietnamese Spiced Chocolate Pot De Creme with Burnt Marshmallow. My companion didn’t fancy it much but I loved the hint of spices, rich chocolate custard and the puffy soft housemade marshmallow fluff. The lightness and sweetness of the marshmallow balanced out the chocolate beautifully.We were each given a bag of laksa popcorn as part of Restaurant Week before leaving – upon trying it a few days later, it was still crunchy, with a strong laksa flavour and slight sweetness. A delicious, savoury snack

Completely disappointingThat sums up my experience at Adrift. While staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel decided to try this restaurant and hoped it would live up to to the hype of some of the reviews I had read gave it. It didn't.We started the evening with drinks from the lounge portion of the restaurant while we waited to be seated. We ordered two of the signature drinks from this establishment and while they were good - they were nothing special and certainly not inspiring or inspired.Once we were seated at our table things started to go very wrong. We were seated next to a couple of young men that ate their food while loudly smacking their lips and chewing with their mouths open. I discretely asked the wait staff if we could be moved and even though the restaurant was at approximately 60% capacity I was denied this courtesy. That seemed odd to me and it should have sent me fleeing - but apparently I needed to learn the hard way about this establishment.Next came the appetizers - the raw oysters were delicious. Very fresh and the light sauce that came with them was very very good - did not overpower the delicate flavour of the oysters while enhancing the flavour. The chef's signature appetizer of the crab melt was nothing to be proud of - it was good; it was not outstanding or inspired or anything more lofty than good.The young chew with their mouths open fellows left - and we settled in for our dinner and a nice bottle of wine. Turns out the bottle of merlot that I ordered was out of stock - but I could instead upgrade for another 10 dollars to another bottle of wine that they "did" have available. Excuse me? Did I hear correctly? Through no fault of my own the restaurant was out of a product that they were advertising as being available and they want to nickel and dime me for another 10 dollars? I had never heard the likes of it - but I fell for the ruse and ordered the more expensive bottle. It was fine in case you were wondering - my taste of dissatisfaction did not extend to the wine, despite being held ransom for the purchase. Our main courses arrived - while my rib steak was very good, my dining companion ordered the duck. This dish was so tough as to be inedible. It was hands down the toughest piece of meat I have personally ever sampled. We called over our waitress and explained the problem and she said she would return it to the kitchen and we could order another dish. I had finished my meal by the time the alternate dish was served to my companion. She had ordered a pork loin that was very good but again not outstanding.By this time another couple were seated next to us. I listened in amusement as the lady seated next to me ordered the duck. Guess what? She returned it also -- the look on her face was priceless as I watched her sample her first bite - a look of horror is probably the best way to sum up her reaction.I was informed upon receipt of my bill not to worry - I had not been charged for the duck. Well I guess not!Totally dis-satisfactory in so many ways. Do yourself a favour and eat in any of the many other award winning chef's restaurants that are part of the Marina Bay complex. Adrift is simply not ready for the big time and without major changes to service and quality control it will not last long.I would not eat here again if I were given a free pass - the experience left a bad taste in my mouth - I will "drift" over to another restaurant

We made Adrift a destination for our holiday in Singapore, having previously dined at chef David Myers' Hinoki and the Bird in Los Angeles. It's situated on the ground floor of the enormous, soulless Marina Bay Sands hotel, mercifully distant from the high-end shops in the mall.The cuisine here is an interesting fusion of East and West but I'm not sure it truly works; it's like Myers has tried to please everyone but has reduced the distinctive qualities of local cuisine in the process. We had a very enjoyable meal but the dishes never "elevated" in the way we were expecting, considering David Myers' pedigree. Prices are reasonable considering the location and the reputation of the restaurant: 17SGD (about £8) for the rice bowl, £15 for a Wagyu hangar steak. Cocktails were very good and the service was excellent, but the food, whilst above average, was slightly disappointing. The decor is great, by the way, and this is a good spot to visit if you're heading to the Gardens by the Bay
2
The kitchen close 10pm, so we didn't have a dinner. There were some snack, very nice but very expensive. The cocktail were perfect.The service was too slow and without organization:food arrive in different time, beverage after the food...but too fast in remoube the plate.Too expensive and not welcoming
5
It's not easy in Singapore to get good bar staff based on so many bad experiences But the latest bar at MBS - Adrift has gone for what looks like triplets from an ex boy band way too handsome LOL GREAT SERVICE And never crossing that line that forgets who is the customerRichard Anthony and Gallilo nicely aided by waitress Rosie look like they are having fun enjoying serving awesome cocktails with a touch of showman manship with a great dash of service. David great new place just don't let this team go Cheer
5
Late lunch with beers - great venue and staff with a truly delicious Waygu burger - worth going back just for that!!
5
A truly amazing restaurant with superb and attentive staff. Food was spectacular and our favourite waitress Rosie was always a pleasure to see. David Myers we cannot wait to come visit you again next year
3
Good bar, good food, good venue....but...The wine list has two French white burgundy wines. One is out of stock. Get some Chablis! Please get some Chablis!

This lacks a consistent unifying concept. ADRIFT, I thought it was sposed to be a nautical theme or a seafood place. It wasnt, and i could not tell what was in stored.Thats what the introductory paragraph on the menu is for, they had to explain what they wanted to convey / achieve. Robataya maybe? Foodwise, disappointed, this was afterall MBS and a celebrity restaurant to boot.The dinner menu was too limited, the emphasis was definitely on drinks, there were more listed than food items. Might as well be a bar.Cheeseburger was passable, taste like pizza. Medium I ordered was on the rare side.The beef was good. But it would be impossible for someone to mess up A5 kagoshima. So its more an indication of the ingredient rather than skill.Sides were bland and unexciting. Fries / Potatoes / CornDesserts so so. In fact the cinnamon in the chocolate tasted a little musky.I highly recommend you have dessert at MBS' other restaurants. Try the offerings at DB, Mozza, leagues ahead. Servers were forgetful.Refilled my cold water with warm waterDidnt bring my coffee. Brought it later after reminding, but without cream (i specifically ordered).Coffee was poor.Served cheap ketchup.Left disappointed, should have gone to another restaurant in MBS
5
Chose this venue after returning from site seeing. My husband and I were guests of the hotel. We were seated straight away, no booking required. Service was impeccable. So attentive. Food was devine. Cheeseburger and pork chop. Sounds simple but the food was very tasty. Atmosphere was also great, easy to chat and cosy. Price is mid range compared to other restaurants, though having said that it was about $100 AUD, however Singapore is an expensive city and I felt the service and food was worth it. This price included drinks. Highly recommend. Will dine here again.
5
Having been to a couple of other celebrity chef restaurants where you were made to feel that the staff were doing you a favour it was refreshing to come to Adrift where the staff made you feel welcome as soon as you approached the entrance. We started out only going into the bar for a drink but the service was superb plus the snacks that came with the drinks were so good we decided to stay for dinner. The staff are obviously well trained and knowledgeable giving us great recommendations on both food and wine. The food was excellent and could not be faulted and coupled with continued excellent service made for a great meal. Unlike many of the other celebrity chef restaurants at Marina Bay where the prices are jaw dropping Adrift's prices are realistic making it a restaurant you can visit again and again to have an impressive night out
5
David Myers and his crew keep Adrift hopping. Lovely ambience, quality food that is delicious and a happening bar. I will keep coming back for more because delicious food deserves special attention! 5 stars all around. Myers is a genius and Jeet keeps the trains running on time.

Met Chef David Myers and tried his signature king crab melt at Epicurean Market and decided that I must try the restaurant! Also tried his laksa popcorn which I absolutely loved but I can see how it's a hit or miss with different people's palate.This review is for Friday dinner service. Our server was very friendly and helpful, the rice crackers they served to start were super addictive, and the food came out so quickly (but it was slightly annoying to have all came out at once, especially with the mix of cold and hot dishes). The king crab melt was as delicious as we remembered and so glad we ordered it again. The fried okra was probably my favorite - it's halved and fried whole, giving it an interesting crispy and chewy texture dipped in a tamarind porky sauce. The crispy baby potatoes were simple but very well-seasoned. I thought the cured hamachi and duck confit gyoza were solid, but did not like the karaage chicken and eggplant salad as much.For drinks, we both had multiple rounds of troublemaker (reminiscent of pimms cup) for me and bee keeper (reminiscent of manhattan) for my boyfriend.For dessert, our server recommended the caramel french toast which was mind-blowing! Best french toast I've ever had in the world - the inside is pillow-soft and the outside is crunchy with sweet coconut sorbet mixed with the slightly bitter coffee syrup. Yummy
4
The food was delicious, definitely worth the visit! Came here with a party of 11 so it was great to be able to try quite a few of the items on the menu! We started off with the crispy chicken, beef toast, the king crab melt, the baby potatoes, okra, grilled corn, and ricotta. All amazing! The entrees and dessert were equally delicious. The cocktails were very innovative as well! The service was spot on from the moment we arrived ! Very attentive staff. The chef even made a visit to our table! Very impressed! For Singapore prices this was very affordable for the type of high end food that was served. Its definitely fine dining for the mid range price
5
Chose this restaurant due to us not being so hungry and only wanted picky food and it ticked all boxes.Lovely ambiance and quite dark inside. The restaurant wasnt busy so there was no wait for food and service.We ordered oysters, potato, lamb, squid and wantons. The food was presented beautifully and delicious except the squid was way too chewy (the only downside
4
Really great food, served at pace we required. Good choice. Service outstanding, nice bar area pre meal time with a good selection of gins!
4
Love the food as it was there was mixture of nice tapas style dishes. Perfect for a drinking night. The cocktail creations was great as well.
4
A Nice Bar at Lobby level of Marina Bay Sands. Service is good and decent collection of Beer. Not too expensive, manageable.
5
Always go back here and only look for a very special person! Annand!! He make sensational cocktails, you cannot possibly miss the guys, only bald Indian dude in the house!! Such a character!!Be sure to try their penicillin which is made with whisky and ginger!
5
Everything from the second I walked in the door till we walked out was 10/10!The atmosphere and the dark dècor of this restaurant are unparalleled, simply to die for.After traveling around Europe for the past month and eating at high end restaurants, Adrift still tops my list for food quality, service and taste.Ace's all roun

If you have read the newspapers lately, you’d realize that the Gypsy Chef himself - Los Angeles-based celebrity chef and restaurateur, David Myers has recently opened a new restaurant in the celebrity chef enclave known simply as - Marina Bay Sands here in Singapore. Being a celebrity chef-owned restaurant, I thought I needed to be resuscitated when I see the prices on the menu. But to my utter delight, I was so thrilled when I saw that the prices weren’t any more expensive vs a normal Western restaurant in Orchard Road. The Gypsy Chef certainly made a wise decision in pricing his restaurant’s menu to something within reach of most Singaporeans. We spent approximately S$165.00 for dinner for 2 pax.What impressed me next about Adrift is its amazing team of waiters. When we entered the restaurant, we were led to our tables by a very polite lady. And our server for the evening was the polite yet humorous, Mark (”as in Mark Antony” to quote from our server). He was so on-the-ball and gave us some amazing recommendations - which I must say is nothing short of excellent!Congratulations, David Myers for hiring such a rad team! That’s already half the battle won in this competitive business. I have been to numerous first class and celebrity chef-owned restaurants here in Singapore and this is by far the BEST RESTAURANT with the most diligent and endearing team! Seriously. The dishes we chose/ate:APPETIZERS:Duck Confit Wantons with Tumeric and Lime Pickle Dip. S$9.00. This is an interesting take on the Chinese Fried Wantons, except that in this case - the fillings is filled with duck meat. Rating: 6/10Grilled Yuba with Truffle Cheese and Togarashi. S$9.00. Very delicious. Uniquely executed. My favorite. Rating: 8/10.King Crab Melt with B&B Pickles. It’s expensively priced at S$17.00 for 4 small pieces. BUT it is really good. Both my friend and I loved this particular dish. An interesting take on the humble sandwich! Rating: 10/10!Crispy Baby Potatoes with Parmesan and Seaweed - to go with our Main Dish. Priced at S$8.00. It was nothing fantastic. The potatoes were a tad dry too. We didn’t finish it. Rating: 3/10.MAIN COURSE:Wagyu Hangar Steak with Gremolata and Chili. Reasonably priced at S$31.00. Thy friend said that the wagyu beef was tender, tasted heavenly and perfectly cooked. Rating: 8/10.Wagyu Cheeseburger with Ajwain Tomato and Pickled Jalapeno. S$25.00. The burger is so huge and reasonably priced. S$25.00. Rating: 8/10.DESSERTS:Caramel French Toast with Coconut Sorbet and Kopi Syrup. One of the best - if not the BEST dessert that I’ve ever tasted in my life! Reasonably priced at S$9.00!! People, this is one dish that is a MUST-ORDER! You’ll thank me later. I promise. The secret ingredient lies in the thick Kopi (Coffee) syrup that makes this dish so extraordinary! Rating: 10/10.Parfait of Raspberry with Rose and Cocoa Mochi. S$9.00. Rating: 7/10. The food here has been nothing short of impressive. Good job to the entire Adrift team and David Myers. You have a winning formula in your hands! Adrift is definitely one of the BEST celebrity-chef owned restaurants in Marina Bay Sands.I'll be back for more

We went there because the menu looked good and different. To be honest we were trying to take a break from the street food and just get a nice fancy dinner. This place is really below expectations, we got several dishes and were just OK, but for Singapore standards and the price we were paying, overpriced. The cocktails in other hand are AMAZING, so I would recomend this place just to get a drink and move on. Stay away from the octopus, very very very chewy and cooked poorly. A shame because the aioli made with the ink was superb.Also stay away from the lobster roll or sandwich. It was just gross and greasy.

We booked online and were seated in a room near the rear of the restaurant with a glass wall looking into pond/gardens. As part of our honeymoon we had wanted something a bit special but not at astronomical prices. We ordered a bottle of prosecco and for starters I had the pork collar which was tasty and my husband had the mushrooms which were nice but nothing extraordinary. For main I had the duck breast and the baby potatoes with seaweed and Parmesa. The duck was cooked pink which was great for me, the skin could have been crispier and a glaze or sauce could have boosted the flavour. The potatoes were really nice, crispy on the outside and full of flavour. My husband ordered the brick chicken and the chips, when the chicken came the foot was still attached (we have chickens for eggs at home so it was a little disconcerting) but tasted nice none the less! For dessert I had the parfait of raspberry and my husband had the guanaja chocolate pot, he loved it, chocolate lover that he is. My dessert tasted lovely but the presentation wasn't the best. Our server Rosie was lovely and when told it was part of our honeymoon she made an extra special effort and had our desserts come out with a happy honeymoon chocolate decoration. With the prosecco and 3 courses the bill ended up at around S$ 220 (£110ish). The pictures show our starters and my dessert

Came here for lunch last Saturday with two friends for a one of their birthdays. We made a reservation and got a very nice table by the window that can seat 6 with nice comfortable couches and cushions. Setting and decor of the restaurant is very nice but it was at least half empty. They had a 3-course lunch option at $45 which we thought was a pretty good deal but we ended up ordering ala carte since there were items on that menu that we liked. We had the kale salad, mushroom toast, hamachi, chicken, scallops and pork to share, and French toast with ice cream for dessert. The best part was the dessert - the French toast was soft, with the ice cream on top was super yummy - and the staff was very nice to write happy birthday on the plate and to all come out and sing happy birthday. But the rest of the food was just okay, nothing exceptional and a bit bland. The kale and hamachi were probably the best. Scallops were $30 for 4 pieces and didn't taste anything special so didn't think was worth the price. Lunch turned out to be almost $200 for 3 which for the quantity and quality we got I didn't think was worth it. But for the ambiance and setting, maybe, just maybe, I'll come back again for the right occasion

The detail which struck me foremost was the number of service staff. Unlike many restaurants where you have to stick you hand in the air for a while, Adrift 's staff is prompt, friendly and sincere. Restaurant is spacious, ambience intimate without being pretentious. Delicious food, quirky cocktails.
