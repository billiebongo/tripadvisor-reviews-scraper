Really nice cafe, food reasonably priced (compared to Australia), good menu as well. Service was great, very prompt. We had marmite mushrooms, delicious although they were a bit cold. The pancakes came out hot and were also delicious. Great coffee as well.
5
I was recommended to try Common Man so went to brunch today with friends. We were seated quickly and service was fast and efficient. Food was absolutely superb; healthy and tasty. Highly recommended. Will definitely return.

Great ambiance, good food. I personally find it a bit noisy and crowded, pricey too but definitely worth a visit ! Pancakes were lovely !

Been to the place a few times and generally it has been a nice experience even though the service can sometimes be a bit uppity. We have had our orders forgotten couple of times. But as we all know that service crew in Singapore treat this job as a pocket money venture during studies, we generally go with low expectations to cafes (even though CMCR prices are more restaurant standard).Ordered pancakes and chicken today although we have had a very nice kale salad previously. Chicken was pretty decent with guacamole while the two pancakes came with walnut crumble (a bit too over baked and pretty hard but still ok) and a berry compote. The amount of berry compote given meant that half way through with one pancake finished there was no more berry compote left. As there was no syrup given with pancakes, I asked for more compote. Got told that I will have to pay. I asked to speak to the manager and was informed nicely by him that generally compote given is enough and they charge for extra sauces. I said “no go and take back this rest of the pancake”. So me and my partner were discussing about this and we realised that our neighbouring couple left one of their pancake uneaten too. So guess what, that sauce was not enough mate

Fantastic fantastic fantastic ! This place is just amazing . Love the ambience . Amazing food ! Probably the best breakfast in Singapore . The pancakes are amazing ! The common mans breakfast is lovely and so is the kale and broccoli scrambled eggs with chicken . The portions are really generous ! Little heavy on the pocket though . These 3 things cost us close to 90SGD . But it is so totally worth it . Would definitely come back and would strongly suggest to foodies !

My "to return to" brunch cafe in Singapore. Its a great locations close to Rob Quay, and the interior design, including the yoga studio on top as well as the open kitchen and bar, makes this place a wonderful relaxed and informal atmosphere that you just dream to return to! The food selection is 5 star in terms of a lunch and brunch option. Better share a few dishes to be able to taste more. If you have a sweet tooth this place has awesome pancakes, but the really treat for me is the various salads and health options as well. All in all the food is amazing. Service has always been good, the only drawback is that you need to wait for your table, so if you are lucky to be able to visit on a week day its easy to be seated and get your fix. This place even in a new building has its own vibe. You will find a good crowd here on the weekends. Tables outside would be an option, but could be very hot if not the cold season. Just go, chill and eat! Second folly has a relaxed cafe that offers some dishes, but unless you are in that mood, I would recommend this place for coffee and a snack. But the small balcony areas are really cute and welcoming
5
Unfortunately no MRT station close by, so I worked up a bit of a sweat walking there, but was not disappointed. Had a Vegetarian Wonderland - poached eggs on sourdough, mushrooms, pesto, tomatoes, spinach, Haloumi. Delicious. Got one fast brew coffee and a freshly pressed juice. Total SIN$ 4
5
We found this place online and, as it was a short stroll from our hotel, decided to try it for brunch. What an absolute winner with good coffee, delicious and innovative food, as well as friendly, efficient staff. The Turkish breakfast is one of the tastiest I've had and the kale salad with scrambled egg whites also deserves a mention. We highly recommend a visit
5
We recently ate at the Common Man, the decor is very western with a great coffee shop/brunch atmosphere. The menu has a lot to choose from and there was plenty of drinks to choose from as well.Me and my partner had the vegetarian breakfast, this consisted of guacamole, halloumi,tomatoes, mushrooms etc, this was a fantastic ditch full of flavour, we also shared the pancakes which were fantastic, they are the best thing on the menu.5/5
1
If your a regular this place appears to be great but as visitors the service was as bad as I have experienced in Singapore. About 30 mind to take our order and then 30 mins to get a 2nd coffee??? And then they had the audacity to charge us for “service”. Food was ok but the surly waitress and poor service ruined the experience. You can get far better value with better service elsewhere.
5
Such a great atmosphere in this unique restaurant. Had a delicious breakfast - the turkish common man breakfast. Beautiful presentation, great service.
5
I am always on the hunt for the best coffee wherever I go. The barista at Common Man knows how the produce a stunner. Highly recommended for your daily caffeine fix. The food is also good and the service excellent by the way.
5
I had a very tasty lunch here, the all day breakfast for me and eggs with kale for my friend, they were delicious! Followed by really great coffee. It's really cool environment with friendly staff.
5
We called on for a special breakfast. It wasn't cheap but it was so delicious. We had the Veggie wonderland. Halloumi was awesome, great service and atmosphere. Definitely recommend
4
The food is fresh and really delicious but you cannot stay here for a long time or to drink coffee and talk to a friend. It is too loud. But if you would like to have a good breakfast then this is the right place.
5
Excellent English breakfast rich in variety. Accompanied by a good Colombian coffee which had a strong aroma. Slightly expensive but well the food justified its price.
5
One of the better places to get coffee in all of south east Asia. The coffee is flavorful and served just right. They also have an excellent selection of beans for purchase. Food is excellent as well. Cool vibe , great place for a brunch with friends

Heard from a Coffee-Guru that CommonMan is a must visit coffee shop while in Singapore. So, was there for an afternoon coffee by myself on August. Amazed by their vibrant interior and lively ambience. As a coffee-geek, of course I was there to try their coffee!Firstly, I ordered a Manual Brew Geisha Panama ($$$) and it was nice, as any other Geisha Panama (but I thought they have the 'Better' Geisha Panama here).So, I decided to order my next coffee : I tried their Flat White and..... it was so so so great!! I was so surprised that the FLAT WHITE tastes veryyy good.. and perhaps it was the best flat white I have ever tried.The only downside of my experience in CommonMan was the staff, a very short-hair girl bartender, who was really unfriendly and rude towards me. It was started when I bought a pack of SGD20 coffee bean, and she once asked me in a murmur voice, which I automatically replied by "YES"...(I thought she was offering me a plastic bag.. -_-).. which later I found out that she started to grind my coffee bean.. So, I stopped her immediately and told her that there was a misheard happening at that time.. I dont need the ground coffee, hence I need to get another pack of coffee bean, but I dont mind to pay again for the coffee bean since the previous pack was opened already.. But, in a rude manner she passed by me and throw the new pack of coffee bean towards a cashier counter in front of me.. and told me that she will pay for my previous coffee bean with HER SALARY... she really said that in an anger voice and high pitch.. everyone suddenly looked at us, I feel so embarrassed at that time. On the other hand, I felt so bad for that girl she will got a cut of her salary, but I already offered her to pay for the coffee, but she refused in a bitter manner... So I left, and havent returned there again even though I came quite often to Singapore
1
I bought a smallBag of NAGA SARIBU, SIDAMANIK, SUMATRA coffee bean in the store and the taste is nasty without any aroma! When I open the bag, the smell is weird, and it turns out to be the beans are still raw and not under roasted, moreover there are lots of bug bitten beans!! The quality of this store is unbelievably awful, will never go there again
4
This coffee shop is the good place to chill out with friends or family. They served the clean & healthy food as well. I & my friend love kale salad served with white egg., delicious dish. The herbal juice taste good too, even my toddler also love it
4
So consistent and always great . Don't run away if you see people waiting outside , they manage well and it's worth the wait . Great food and coffee and nice team
5
Very good restaurant, relaxed atmosphere, great staff. Good coffee. Average food.
It's a good place to sit and meet with your friends and catch up.
5
Excellent food, staff, presentation and coffee. Lively energy, very busy place. Great for breakfast and caffeine fix!
5
The food quality, presentation and taste are all super. Pairing with a cup of coffee is perfect. For the rest... no comment. Seeing is believing dan do enjoy the food
3
I was pretty disappointed in the service and and food itself.. the eggs Benedict was overcooked and the server confused and slow. I had higher expectations.
4
The seared salmon salad in a wasabi vinaigrette sauce, topped with lots of crispy fish skin, was fantastic. Coffee was good too. Ambience is hip, place is bright and airy with high ceilings. Good place to hang out.
3
On my search for Singapore’s best coffee, this place was on the TripAdvisor list. It definitely tries hard to be a great place but really a. It overratedThe coffee was a bit bitter and the cappuccino was more like a flat white. The milk had not been stretched enough and I had to reach for the sugar bowl. I got the pancakes because I love pancakes, considering the pancakes arrived before the coffee, I am going to assume they were Pre-made and microwaved (certainly tasted that way), the eggs did look good so that might be a better option.This doesn’t make my recommended coffee list for Singapor
4
We had a great breakfast and really enjoyed both the food as well as the coffee. We had the veggie breakfast with delicious tomatoes in a pesto dressing, fluffy blueberry pancakes and perfect eggs Benedict. Each dish was around $20 each. The coffee was fantastic too. We sat outside in the shaded seating area. Inside had a great atmosphere. Definitely worth trying.
5
After searching far and wide for the trifecta of great coffee, great food, great service, we finally found Common Man Coffee Roasters. It has the added benefit of great location! Expect to queue in line for a few minutes as it is always busy. But the staff and service are exceptional. You can expect to be seated and served surprisingly fast considering how busy it is. We've been back twice in the past week. And the coffee is the best we've found in Singapore so far
5
Read great reviews so wasnt disappointedCoffee execellent had big breakie and it was as good as any big breaky ive had Partner had kale with chicken she was generally happy other than chicken was a little dry.please note that address is wrong on trip advisor as we travelled 10 km s away the day before
5
One of the best coffees I have had all coffee places included. Surprisingly tasty. The food is also very good and there is a wide variety.
3
The deco is nicer than average coffee/brunch place. The variety is quite limited while the taste is non extraordinary. Coffee (the brew one) is just average. The only thing far from average is "price"...80 sgd or 65 usd for two breakfast dishes and three drinks are not worth visiting esp its lcoated far from attraction but just peaceful residential area.
4
We went to this place after we were recommended to visit by a local friend of ours. There was a long queue but it moved pretty fast and we got a table quickly. My husband ordered a coffee called the unknown and I ordered a lovely gluten free dessert with salted caramel icecream. The brunch selection looked great and the place had an interesting atmosphere. Prices are slightly higher than usual
2
I went to Common Man Coffee Roasters as I had seen a lot of posivtive reviews. Looking at the price list it's equivalent to a mid-range dinner. However with an open mind I decide to order their full breakfast. The food was served slightly burn, scramble egg and sourdough were quite good but that's about it. Service was a bit slow and waiter forgot we asked for our bill twice. It was a bit noisy on weekends as well. I would not return again for a $40 breakfast
3
I was in this place for breakfast and spent 30sgdollars for a coffee, a water and a overly sweetened granola with yoghurt. The price was not justified by the quality...overloading food with sugar doesn t make it better. Otherwise coffee was really good and the service as well ;)
5
Yes, I am a self-confessed coffee snob and I can say hand on heart that I did not expect to find mediocre coffee in Singapore let alone the exceptional coffee served at Common Man Coffee Roasters. As a New Zealander we pride ourselves on our coffee and good barista's are held in high esteem. This cafe served amazing espresso consistently, every time. The food was beautiful and the service great. I can't say enough good things about this place
3
I came here as part of a search for excellent coffee in Singapore, what I got was a place aiming for excellence, but I'm not sure at what.Large and airy as so many coffee places are, it somehow manages to also be cramped, have a reputation for quality food and an excellent bar selection, but appears undecided on the coffee. A great coffee machine, but no espresso on the menu? I'm sure i could have got one if i'd asked, but if you can't be bothered putting it up on the menu..... Coffee offerings all favour pour over, which are crafted well and come with tasting notes, but my bias couldn't get past the indifference toward espresso. Definitely give it a try if your hungry or a pour over aficionado, but if you love espresso.......
3
I went here as it was convenient after i finished my yoga class upstairs. There was a Q to get in so i took this as a good sign. I was eating alone and to say i felt very awkward and uncomfortable was an under statement. I was put at a table with three men who i did not know, I understand its a busy place and they want to make most use of the tables but to be sitting on top on three people who i didn't know ruined the experience for me and i'm sure those three guys wanted some privacy also. i was excited for some good coffee and was disappointed. The breakfast i ordered was nice, i ordered "House-baked Beans with Confit Chorizo, i was excited for some chorizo and then disappointed as i got about 3 pieces hidden in with the beans under a forest of rocket lettuce. Service was ok but felt they wanted me to eat quickly and leave. Took awhile to get anyones attention to pay the bill and though they were not busy. I will go back and give it another tr
3
Went there, after looking at the menu, I didn't feel eating anything, first time of my life.The ginger beer is from a bottle, not natural, and not tasty. The chicken is cooked simply with a salad on its size, i didn find nothing interesting but the crowd that rush there i dont even know why. i will pass next time for sure. The service was as well very slow
3
So I travel for music, food, coffee and beer. And a recent Feb-March trip to Singapore-Jakarta meant an opportunity to carry home some great coffee beans. I did buy some of the best coffee beans in the world like Mandailing, Toraja and Kopi Luwak. Had heard a lot about Common Man so I had to buy some from them before I left. I loved their cafe. Cool people, cool vibes and a lot of interesting things to eat. But since I was in a hurry I could neither eat nor sample their coffee. So I bought some beans on their recommendation. I couldn't wait to get back home in Mumbai, India to make those awesome cups of coffee with these beans. And so I did. I like my coffee and I like it good. BUT, I found their coffee pretty average. It wasn't as bad or crappy like Starbucks but it was just average. Sorry guys, I may sound harsh but I have to say what I felt
4
Lots of Vegetarian Options It is a busy place and dont do resrvations It is first come basis. It is spacious and even has outside sitting arangements
5
We walked the 2.8km along the river from the CBD to get here, and it was worth the walk. The long macchiato packs a punch, I had two, and they were consistently smooth and delicious.
5
Great food and amazing coffee! Plenty of quality vegetarian options too.
Go early on the weekend to avoid a long queue.
Veggie wonderland, granola and pancakes are our faves!
4
Nice cafe and cozy .. came for brunch .. The Common Man Coffee roasters is one of the few cafes around which does serve both good coffee and food .. The coffee was aromatic, the texture is very light. I was recommended the Turkish Common man Breakfast Phyllo wrapped soft boiled organic egg, crispy teta , fresh cucumber & tomatoes, olives and hummus with pita bread. Food is good but a bit overpriced . 
4
We drop by this place to try the coffeeThey said its goodThe coffee is goodWe order filter coffee, black coffee, latte, hot choc , and an OJService were greatWe also order churros : goodOrder french fries : goodFish burger : not goodTaste blandThe fish patty is fish
5
Singapore is not short of great places to eat. Even in this setting, Common Man Coffee Roasters stands out for its unique combination of high quality food, beverages, service and aesthetics. The available choices on the menu are varied and allow for different tastes and moods. My personal favourite is the cold brew coffee with the Common Man Veggie Wonderland, enhanced with sausage or bacon as an extra. I have never been disappointed with my experience here and have never regretted my decision to come. Highly recommended but also very popular so expect the possibility to queue 
4
I decided to check out on this place after some good review online. I was there on a Saturday morning 9+ and there is already quite a crowd in the cafe. I especially loved their mocha.. is the type of standard that you cannot find find easily in Singapore. Their signature full breakfast dish was good and the pancake was unique. It is on the coarse type with banana favour, fresh nuts and dried cranberries topping. If you don't like banana then forget about ordering. If you are not a coffee person then they served fresh squeezed juices as well. The indoor seating is big but gets full quite quickly. If you don't mind the outdoor seating, they are usually available
2
It should have been great! I wanted it to be our safe go to for good coffee and breakfast! Loads of people, funky vibe and great restaurant layout! Sadly so miserably deflated. Coffee was brilliant but it stopped there. Food we ordered was terrible, we needed a carving knife and a set of steel teeth to taste the toast. Staff did listen and offered free drinks to compensate. $160 later.......we won't be back!
5
Urban style - art deco design combined with floor to ceiling windows and all day breakfast menu is a great place to have your weekend brunch, that is the reason why it was so packed on Saturday. All brunch classics were prepared with some kind of twist. We pleasantly dived into our seared salmon salad with wasabi vinaigrette, in which every piece of fish is cooked rare yet still sustained this creamy feeling. Common man veggie wonderland is a lighter version of a full breakfast and featured some of our favorite flavors: halloumi cheese, portobello mushroom, spinach, avocado and lime, sourdough bread and eggs in any style. If we could, we would definitely dine here every single meal.
5
Just had breakfast with my wife, daughter and her husband. Great atmosphere in the place and we had a mix of breakfasts and whilst three of us really enjoyed our meals one was not to taste. Nothing wrong with the food just didn't hit the mark. The three of us had great breakfasts and lovely juices
5
Lots of food to choose from and love that their flexible in changing items as I'm a vegetarian. Love the food and their coffee! Really strong and nutty.
4
It's a perfect place for a pause. Awesome coffee and an amazing apple pie. The staff was very friendly too
4
Friendly staff and with a wide selection of food and dessert. Personally i like the interior design! :)
5
I loved Common Man - I had eggs benedict with braised ox cheeks and it was divine. My flat white was excellent. 10/10 will come again
4
I went there in the after, this place was packed. I recommend to sit outside, inside is very noisy. Coffee is good but the best is carrot cake
5
The vegetarian brunch is absolutely amazing. Great coffee, really can't go wrong. Great veggie options. They serve free range eggs which is a huge plus
5
Found Common Man online prior to coming to Singapore. They roast their own coffee and do third wave - pour over V60 and aero press. Food was superb pancakes with caramelised banana and avocado smash with egg. Great service, got there early on a Saturday morning and by the time we left at 8.30 it was nearly full. Spacious and inviting. Great experience, particular the theatre in how they present the coffee.
5
'Common Man' is a sign of "new Singapore" as it flips too many bad restaurant qualities in 'Lion City' on their head. This is an amazing spot to grab a coffee/breakfast/brunch.Lots of veggie options, kind & swift service (even Sunday morning at 10am!), and high-quality food & drink.They offer plenty, but do just enough to get everything right. Kudos to the 'Common Man' crew for being a great all-around spot.NOTE: If you can't make it here, look to '40 Hands' just west of city-centre/CBD. Same owner; similar quality service & goods (thought a little small/cramped)
4
First of all, this place is in 22 Martin Road and the address reflected on Tripadvisor is wrong for the other one at Serangoon. There is no Common Man at Serangoon at all.The coffee beans are really good and very decent, tastefully completed with latte art design.Try to go early and beat the morning crowd. Reaching at 9.30am is considered pretty late and it will be noisier, but feel more at ease chatting aloud with friends. Feels like home. However, if you want some quiet moments, go very early on a weekend. At least you can read a book and drink. A potential queue can form from 9.45am onwards.The staff is not very attentive to the orders. I read online that orders can get missed out. It is true. If you waited some time, be prepared to remind them again. Service staff needs to be more attentive or, perhaps, more manpower is needed on a weekend to improve the overall service quality. Do sit on the lower chairs. The higher chairs at the bar is not suitable for people who are tall. the bar table edge design at the bottom can be pointed and you can get knocked on your knees. You may need to sit sideways. Not a choice if you are late.Only good to see baristas at work.Overall, a nice place to hang out for coffee with friends and family for a good chat.https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4812074-r482094583-Common_Man_Coffee_Roasters-Singapore.html

Great spot down town for decent coffee. It's at the bottom of a tower block and the interior has been done well. It was busy and the coffee was very good - I didn't try the food but it looked good
4
2 weekends that I was in Singapore visited here with Grandson and Son-in-law for the excellent croissants and other varied kind of breakfast choices.Buzzing place to wake you up nice and alive.
1
Have been extremely disappointed by this place.
In short, portion for anorexics, over priced and no taste.
3
The address listed on Trip Advisor is wrong. It should read 22 MARTIN Rd. After a $22 taxi ride we finally got here. The staff were very apologetic and covered our cab fee. The coffee was excellent.
5
Great food and service, favorite coffee and breakfast place in singapore!highly recommended for visit
4
Visited Common Man Coffee Roasters on a Sunday noon for some quick brunch with my friends. What struck us the most was how crowded it was. Despite that, we managed to get a table rather quickly. The interior of the cafe exuded a homely feel that evoked familiar feelings. The menu is extensive so is the coffee selection. We ordered the Common Man Uncommon Breakfast Set and the uncommon wagyu burger and the chilli flakes coated fries. The portions were huge and every element in the breakfast set was well cooked. I loved the Iced mocha as well. All in all, the frankly the food wasn't really mind-blowing. However, the service is commendable. Despite being full house during our visit, food came somewhat timely and all requests were met in a timely fashion
4
If you also find it difficult to order a good western breakfast in SG, then this place is for you. We arrived at 9am and were seated immediately. When we left at 10:15, there was a sizeable queue at the door. Eggs Benedict was well prepared, good ingredients, but OK. It's made with beef rather than pork, so that kind of took some of the pleasure away. But still, a good dish. My Wife ordered the Turkish breakfast and it was superb. I will absolutely be back for that plate.Bloody Mary and champagne are available, if you enjoy a good escape. Service was Super efficient and of high standard (rate in SG).This place is a keeper.
5
Love this place , especially for brunch , really great food and reasonable price . Always busy and full of a good mixed crowd . Even if there is a waitinglits outside , you get in quite quickly . Team is great , smiling and paying good attention . Cool place
5
A great cuppa....and great breakfast food. Service always friendly and verbally pretty quick. Gets pretty busy on weekends so recommend getting there before 9 if you can otherwise there may be a wait in things. Been there several times and it's always great. Fun to sit at counter and have the baristas take you through a few different coffees - helpful for your next order
5
This place blew our minds. I'm a third-wave coffee addict and a brunch resto hunter. This place is both. I had the Uncommon coffee worth SG$8 and I promise this will be worth any queue you may have to do if you come on a weekend.
5
was ushered in by the friendly staff, who kept waiting on us. had the wholemeal breakfast smoothy and fruits set, which was a good cure for a hangover. nice place to chill at
3
Went here for Brunch with my wife and baby. Very accommodating. Friendly staff. The food was good, but not great. Pretty average. The coffee is also ok. Everything is overpriced. You don't get much value for money here. Overall, an ok experience.
1
Been here quite a lot last year but first time in 2017. Noisy as usual but food is not nearly as good, and it takes more than an hour for a simple plate. Not coming back until next year, if it's still around.
4
Service was excellent and the food was incredible. We all had the common man breakfast - the chorizo baked beans were so delicious. Serves good coffee too. Juices are tasty but small.
5
We had the boneless chicken with the avocado salsa as well as the salmon salad and both dishes were great, would absolutely go back to this place!
5
Really gooood PanCake and Coffee. Have not tasted PanCakes this good friendly staff. Enjoyed the breafast so much had to come back before leaving the country😊...
5
Incredible and inventive breakfasts! Coffee was really strong but super tasty. Would recommend the croque monsieur and the common man veggie wonderland. Great atmosphere overall.
1
Brunch on a sunday. 30minutes for juice to arrive, 50 minutes for food. No explanation or apology despite asking multiple times. No one brought the bill either despite asking for it. Operationally a disaste
3
Very nice food/ambience but we had to remind one of the staff three times that we did not get our food and it took them more than an hour to serve one of our friends which almost made him leave the place. There was no apology whatsoever from the manager/staff so next time we would definitely need to keep on reminding them that we are waiting for our food.
5
Really the food and coffee are just perfect. Coffee and Wifi strong which is always a good match. Look at that photo! It was the best breakfast in years. Only change I would make is to redirect the air conditioning. Can be to chilly if you're sitting in the blast path. But that coffee. I knew it would be good. The concentration on the barista's face said it all. Having just got off a 11hr flight I was Renewed. Revived. Refreshed. Reinvented. Ready. See you tomorrow.
3
Good option in Singapore for healthy fare, but don't bother dining there, better to opt for delivery via Uber Eats. The service is poor, namely the Grounded cashier was extremely rude...
2
So the guy upstairs is a bit cocky and acts like his time is more important than the customers. Makes the environment kinda tense and uncomfortable. Food is 3 plus and coffee does the trick. Just need to really revamp the staff upstairs.
5
Best coffee in town! Good service and great breakfast menu! We are regulars! Love the place and their staff!!
Please get back the old ceramic mugs!!
5
We just love coming to this place for breakfast , any day! Friendly staff, delicious dishes and decent prices.
The coffee is a must to try Hwee butt also their breakfast options, very fulfilling.
4
Excellent brew, enjoyed tasting the taste of coffee, although had to ask for an extra shot. Nice vibe and decent breakfasts. Although price point is above average for both coffee and food
4
The latte was brilliant and the kale and egg whites salad superb.
Nice location and ambience.
Pricey though. But what price goddess coffee eh?
Pricey though.
1
After a series of unfortunate bad service, the manager, named May, topped it up by asking us for $10 exactly after my friend blew his' birthday candles. Not informing us in advance even though it was very visible, and not waiting till the typical birthday rituals were over before she lectured us on policies. She has managed to say all this without a single sorry or a thank you. All those efforts to create good coffees, good food and cosy ambience are nothing if you don't even have basic service intact or at least, proper manners
5
Located near Clarke Quay, CM is a funky cafe that serves great coffee and also serves a quality all day breakfast - often hard to find in SG. Lots of cool people visit during the day and it gets pretty crowded on the weekends and understandably so. If it's busy - just grab a seat at the bar. Service is great, food is top notch, they have wifi and the service is quick. Food is not cheap which is good - quality and service makes up for i
5
Vibrant, funky cafe! Excellent food and great coffee. I had shared the common man burger and quinoa salad with a friend and both were delicious, especially the salad! For dessert we shared the sweet potato carrot cake and the common man churros and again both were fantastic! Great coffee of course. Excellent experience!
3
We were brought here by friends from Singapore and this is really a stylish cafe with good vibes. We tried their brunch menu which was simple and delicious, and were recommended their cold brew coffee. Overall good place to visit but it is expensive for what it is
4
Ambience of the cafe is good for a weekend relax.
Good coffee and the coffee smells good too.
Note: pls go early as the queue was long!!!
4
Very good brekkie, nice coffee and staff. For some reason the best high table is saved for the people who work here. Good place though.
4
Had breakfast here this morning. Food was exactly like Aussie breakfast. Service was super quick once I ordered. Staff was nice! Very clean and food was delicious! Highly recommend their coffee too!
4
We had a friend from overseas and her hotel recommended this place.
Ordered the breakfast set and wagyu burger. The wagyu burger was really good and we prefer it over the breakfast set
Hot chocolate and latte were nicely done as well :)
5
Wandered over here from the hotel that we were staying at as breakfast was not included. What an absolute haven! Fabulous coffee!!!! Delicious satisfying food. Staff are to be complemented on their service skills they knew how to sit and manage seating people. We all know how difficult it is when you know there is going to be arrivals with prams and kids. And selfish people who just feel like they are entitled to taking a table of 4 when there is only one of them... tho everyone knows it may look empty now but in less 12 minutes the place is going to be packed to the gills. Everything looked and tasted amazing....you ticked all our boxes on more than a couple of visits!!

It's difficult to get good coffee in much of Singapore, so if you go for a walk along the river this shop is worth finding. Not only is the coffee excellent, the food was very good and well marked for dietary needs. I found this place using the Bean Hunter app and would recommend it highly to others
3
We went here expecting a nice breakfast. My wife really liked her Croissant breakfast. My full breakfast was a mixed bag, probably not worth the $30+ price. TIP: Give the "filtered" coffee a miss -- it is very weak coffee. We both ordered the long black which was excellent
5
I had heard mixed reviews of this place, so was nervous about meeting a friend here from overseas. The service was great with competent and efficient staff. We ordered the big breakfast and the pancakes and they were so good. We all thought it was one of the tastiest and best breakfasts we have ever had. to finish off the coffees were awesome! This is definitely going to be our favourite breakfast place. Our visitor from overseas travels a lot for work and he was highly impressed
3
Excellent breakfast, relaxed atmosphere, seemingly varied selection of coffee isn't that varied as its all light to medium roasted. Karatina (a truly great coffee from Kenya) tasted only OK. It should be spectacular. I would have made a darker roast. Sadly the fashion for high acidity lightly roasted coffee appears to have affected Singapore.When you have the opportunity for such variety why not vary the roast too!
5
A lovely place if you would like to grab a coffee or some nice food. Had an excellent ice latte and sweet potato cake. The place is stylish and cozy, busy with people coming and going and the yoga is happening upstairs. I havent had much of a sense of wanting to linger in a cafe in singapore before which i have been misding but this place has actually a good place to do that (until you realise the aircon is on freezing temperature so better dress up
5
It's been a while since I've been here, but the food is as lovely as ever. I especially love their chips - the best in Singapore. Also, if you have a sweet tooth, their iced chocolate is pretty good.
5
Good place,
Nice staff and a delicious hamburger. The cappuccino is served with a nice illustration. The hamburger bun is too sweat in my opinion.
5
Great coffee, up with Melbourne standards. Food was yum, we had the house baked beans and organic eggs benedict. Food came out very quickly, overall great spot for breakfast. However, a bit pricey.
5
We come here almost twice everything month. Great coffee, food, ambience and service. Must try their Turkish CommonMan and pancakes.
5
We stopped in for Brunch as we had found it on trip advisor. The food is trendy, western, organic and healthy style. We were both extremely happy with our food! I had a vegetarian breakfast (served all day) I'm not even a veggie but the line up was so good I couldn't miss it! It contained sautÃ©ed spinach, pesto tomatoes, grilled hallumi, eggs any style, sourdough and field Mushroom. My partner had eggs Benedict which had ox cheek on top of the toast. The combo was delicious. So many other amazing things on the menu that we will go again this week before we go home. Fantastic coffee and drinks are served with quirky medicine bottles containing water and drinks.They also serve lovely sounding juice drinks.
4
Kinda American style, crowded during peak hours (lunch) with a little lack of service compared to the modern-casual ambiance (no host/ess to welcome, same it goes with those gentle though very busy waitresses running around).Yummy but heavy Benedict with braised cheek, couldn't be otherwise. Not overpriced yet on a higher level average check indeed. Will be back to try different stuffs.
5
We're working our way through the breakfast menu while staying just nearby. The coffee is great, the service is friendly and efficient and the menu is inventive with delicious, generous portions. The fluffy egg white thing with broccoli and asparagus must have been healthy but was the yummiest choice so far.
4
Perfect spot for brunch! Everything on the menu is unique but delicious. The coffee is also out of this world. The staff is very friendly although it can get busy so may take a few extra minutes to get your check, etc. The decor is awesome too. I strongly recommend this spot
2
We walked into this place while searching for post-lunch coffee. It seems quite crowded so we came in and ordered a cold brew and a orange grapefruit juice - boy, both are bad choices!As a cold brew, the after-taste is ridiculously bitter and sour (they put orange peel into the coffee). The service is also very inconsiderate - asked for skim milk and wasn't served. Asked 2nd time, it finally came but with no stirring stick.The orange grapefruit also tastes yucky cause the grapefruit was apparently raw when they made it into juice. It tastes too sour and bitter!Overall, this is a very loud place that fails to meet any expectation on the beverages
5
This cafe is one of our favorite cafes in Singapore. I brought my brother here the other day and he was so impressed with the amount of serving that he got from his order and ofcourse the service was exceptional. Kudos to Chef Rue of the CMCR for always giving us an amazing healthy dining experience whenever we dine here
4
"Common Man" might be a bit misleading (probably a sarcasm) since the price level is quite high ;) Nevertheless, drinks and snacks served ARE uper class. Lots of veggie choices and the composition of dishes is way beyond common...
5
Have tried Common Man delivery via Uber Eats a few times now and never disappointed! The matcha pancakes were a bit dry, but everything else has been fantastic including the avocado on toast, energy balls and white coffee.
5
Visited for a late breakfast on a Saturday afternoon. There was a queue out of the door when we arrived ... But don't let this put you off. The staff member hosting the door was excellent. Well organized and helpful! And we didn't even wait. Plenty of seats inside and out. The veggie breakfast and full breakfast were excellent. Served in no time at all, even although the place was packed! we ordered the filtered coffee and we asked for cold milk on the side. When the girl delivered the coffee she politely advised us to try without the milk first ... Please take the Advice from these coffee experts ... They know their stuff :-) Thanks to the team for a great experience ...
5
Being Australian I love my coffee.. and its always so hard to find a good coffee here in SG... Here they do a great coffee/ great food. The service is great but a little pricey.. I suppose thats what you get for being in Robertson Quay.. still a great spot for breakfast or lunch
2
I went to this place expecting really good coffee and food. The coffee was way to bitter and the food was just ok but given the prices in this place you expect it to be amazing. I asked the girl at the counter why the coffee was so bitter and she explained they serve double shoot coffees here, well thanks for the heads up
5
This is the first place I actually at in Singapore on the recommendation of a local. I went with 3 friends and we all got different dishes, everyone was more than satisfied. I got the salmon wasabi salad, unique and super tasty. Delicious coffee menu to boot. Must try
3
I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob, but have never left a bad review about a coffee place until today. It's absolutely awful! I couldn't even finish it. Food was good, staff were OK, wouldn't kill them to crack a smile. But wow. If you like coffee, don't go here. Worst I've had in Singapore. The free coffee in my hostel tastes better than this.
5
So far this is the best coffee I've had in Singapore.We came in on a busy Sunday morning for one coffee and had breakfast and two coffees each. The food is a bit pricey but we couldn't fault the quality or the service, they really have got the food service worked out, our food was delivers very quickly on a very busy Sunday morning.
3
Good breakfast and coffee but the level of service of the staff are just ok. You know in the morning what customers expect to receive the greeting from the staff? They are just working, not with their heart. I ordered pancakes which is very yummy but a bit too sweet for me
5
The place was close to full at 8:45 in the morning which is a testimony to its popularity.Their brew of black coffee was slightly sweet and had a great taste. Latte was similarly good. Breakfast portions are large and have a decent variety to choose from
4
Enjoyable breakfast and good coffee. Staff were very good. Slightly on the expensive side though, would go back again
4
You can always tell when your in the right place. It's the concentration of the barista. A craftsman. (Woman) only thing I would change is the milk. Not sure it's easy to find but a real coffee needs raw milk.
4
Went to check it out..
1) great atmosphere
2)amazing food tried the Turkish eggs, quinoa salad., and chicken all was good.
3) good coffee but under expectation a bit but good overall.
Totally recommend it
Don't forget the oatmeal smothie with banana I loved it.
5
One of my favorite breakfast places in Singapore. Coffees are awesome and barista staff very knowledgeable. If you're hungry like I was, go for the common man full breakfast special. Very tasty, lovely presented and keeps you going till the afternoon!
5
Great place for brunch. Some queue but service is fast. Good selection of food and chilled out place . Location can't be missed. Coffee is great
4
The place: the shop is nice and well laid out. The food: great food, everything we tasted was stellarThe service: the couple of times we were there, understaff, it was very hard to grab anyone's attention and get service.The coffee: great selection.Value: average 
4
Great cafe with nice decor and polite and efficient staff . We went on recommendations from a friend. All day breakfast is served from pancakes to the full fry up. The lunch menu looks good too. Food was tasty n well presented . Coffee was nice - but hey they are the roasters . At the higher end of the market in price - $27 for full breakfast n $22 for beans n eggs -It has to be good to have a line of people waiting for a table 
5
Loved the food, loved the place, loved the ambience! Had the fluffy pancakes and it has spoiled all other pancakes for me. Common Man's is the new benchmark.We came early so there were available seating to seat us right after. When we were done close to 9am, there was a queue forming so do come early
5
This is one of the most popular cafes in Singapore as per reviews in TripAdvisor, that's why I decided to go there. To say the truth is is quire expensive, but the meals are big enough. I've tried meal with hummus and enjouyed it a lot.Summury - nice place to go
5
Love the Common Man. I come here regularly for brunch with friends because the service and the food are reliable. I highly recommend the Veggie Wonderland and the Turkish Breakfast. Big, fulfilling, delicious meals. It can get quite busy and sometimes it can take a few minutes to get the attention of a waiter, but they are typically attentive and helpful when they serve you. This is one of my favourite brunch places in Singapore.
5
Awesome atmosphere, amazing coffee and grub. Service consistently efficient and friendly. Easy to get addicted to this place.
4
A regular hangout place on weekends for me to enjoy a cuppa!! The Turkish brekkie is my favourite!! A very accomodating restaurant even if you go without a reservation!!
5
A great mix of western and Asian flavours within this restaurant. Located in an apartment area it is busy from woo to go. Friendly attentive and cheerful staff assisting quickly. Meals are quick and all tasted great. Coffee is also wonderful. Hip, urban establishment.
4
We had breakfast here and it was lovely. Coffee is top notch, they make it very credible the coffee roaster thing. Food is simple and delicious. Healthy and hearty options available. Atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Communal dining is very nice. Highly recommended.
4
Nice place, wonderful food, prices quite high. Breakfast is served all day, definitely worth visiting!
5
Loved the vibe and the food. Very busy but great hipster vibe to it. Bustling with life and decent coffee for Asia. Will definitely come back
2
My 1st visit on a Sunday Noon.Close to full house and one would have expected a yummy array of food choices.We ordered pancakes, eggs benedict and breakfast which lets say i had expected to be awesome but they just below average.I would only give it a 2nd shot for the superb service and efficiency
5
As a business traveller to SG, I always stop in at Common man. Best coffee hands down and the food is fab! The kale and egg white breakfast is truly amazing. It does get a little busy but thats because its so good! The only recommendation I would have is that they begin to stock gluten free bread, its the only thing missing and a bit surprising that a place as high calibre at this doesn't have it. Fabulous regardless and will be back....again...and again
4
This is a quaint place near the river in Singapore, pretty good value and good atmosphere. Flat whites are $5. We has kale salad ($19) with a chicken side dish ($7) and it was very nice. The place was really busy on a Saturday morning so get there earl
1
Overall very poor experience. Place is very understaffed which leads to a slow and forgetful service. Hummus starter was the only real good part of the meal. The beef burger was overcooked, fish burger dry and tasteless. For the prices they are charging I really expected much better. To top it all off we had to ask for the bill 3 times and waited 30 mins for it. Only when threatening to leave without paying did they finally provide us with one. Will certainly not visit again.
4
Really fresh and interesting food. Particularly enjoy their breakfast and salads.
Tasty dressing
Can be pricy, although not too far off Singapore standard pricing.
Shame they don't do decaf coffee
3
Can get rather busy and noisy during lunch time, when finding a seat can be a problem. Food wise, standard cafe affair but rather pricey.
4
Hmmmm. Mixed views about this cafe. On the one hand, the brunch was excellent and the coffee very nice indeed. Good service too. But the price is very very expensive. 3 adults and two children was S$160+. Wow, not sure if it was worth it.
5
Clearly very popular as it was difficult to get a table as the place was packed . Had best breakfast ever. Pea fritters, topped with poached eggs, served on a bed of rocket drizzled with balsamic. Scrummy. Coffee tasted amazing. Not that expensive either.
4
Flat white was excellent, as was the granola, yougurt and fruit breakfast. Quirky inside with bar area. Staff attentive. Although it was quiet when I arrive, by the time I left it was busy and way too noisy for me. The number of seat for its size is high, hense the noise. I would go back if I was in the area and it didnt look too busy, as for me this spoilt the atmosphere. Mix of people, business, couples, families, solo, anyone would fit in and feel comfortable $5 for coffee, $15 for breakfast and they added 10% service charge and tax
4
During our staycation at Studio M, we explored around the vicinity and it seems like there’s alot of interesting café around and one of them is this, so we decided to grab a quick brunch there. The café was quite crowded but we are lucky enough a seat for two.Grilled juicy ‘chilli’ boneless chicken with crushed avocado salsa and caramelized lemon. Though the chicken looks dry, but to our surprise, it’s super juicy and quite tender. Instead of mashed potato or wedges, I love the crushed avocado salsa which blends really well with the rocket leaves.Read more about our dining experience on darrenbloggie.co

We popped into Common Man Roasters on a Sunday after 1400. The restaurant was busy and noisy. The crowd was relatively young but there were families as well. However the service was fast and efficient. The menu is extensive and good for vegetarians as well. I tried the breakfast kale and egg white scramble which was good with coffee. The coffee is good but a bit weak so go for a double shot. Not the cheapest but the food options are good.
4
We went here recently for an early lunch. The menu selection is excellent for that time of day with a lot of egg dishes on the menu and everything was really yummy! Everything was served swiftly and the staff were all very friendly.It can get quite noisy so I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a peaceful and quiet lunch or brunch
5
As a trip advisor recommended, We went to this restaurant, we ordered pancakes and chicken with avocado salad it's really delicious, and we loved the coffee, it's special, nutty flavouer , it's one of the best coffe I have ever had ! Yes ... It's !! Highly recommended
4
A good place for Sunday brunch!星期天早上的休閒時光！ There are so many western families bring their kids out there!a bit noisy!很多西方家庭在此吃早午餐，有些太多人了，有些吵！For the food and coffee there are ok, we have had Full breakfast(s27), veget wonderland(s25, expensive!!), egg benedict(s24), cuppuccino(5), filter coffee with yirgzero beans(6, reasonable price!) and a cold brew Nitro(8). Overall is a 4/5!食物方面我們試了三組咖啡和食物，給他們一個4/5評比！價格方面中高，因為地方有點吵，性價比3.5/5
5
Great selection, fresh ingredients, best coffee in Singapore. Eggs Benedict, pancakes, veggie board are all amazing.
5
Recommended by a friend and definitely recommend this place. Good vibes & good coffee. Very warm, friendly & attentive staff.
4
Great option for coffee and breakfast in River Valley / Rob Quay. People come from all over Singapore for brunch here - so best to get in early to avoid the queues. Friendly attentive service.
3
A beautiful, cool little cafe near the singapore river. We had a water, the pancakes and granola with fresh fruit and greek yoghurt. The granola was good, but the pancakes were to sweet to eat them, so we only ate a half. We paid 50 singapore dollars which is quiet a lot, but normal for singapore.
4
Tucked in a nice and quiet corner of Martin Road, but it is a very busy cafÃ©. We had late lunch, grilled chicken and pulled pork burger. Not surprisingly wow, just good. Our cappuccino is just alright, however the hot mocha was much better. Both were served very well as this place also trains barista. This is a great causal place to catch up with friends or just a lone reading a book. Parking at the building on Saturday afternoon is a little expensive, $6.00 for us
5
Only one size takeaway cappuccino was offered and at $5.35 was reasonable value for Singapore. It was much better coffee than yesterday's coffee from a well known chain of three letters nearby.The cafe was very busy this Saturday morning.If there weren't some other places to try over the coming days during my stay, I'd certainly return for another morning coffee
3
Sunday, 11am, there's a line out the front door - my heart drops a bit as the place seems packed to bursting point. I notice a sign that says, a wait longer than 25 minutes gets a free coffee, so there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Fortunately, being a party of two, we are seated quite quickly, resulting in larger groups continuing their wait.We were seated on a circular communal bench table with high stools that were somewhat comfortable. The atmosphere was nice, though chatter was loud due to the numbers being hosted.The menu offered some interesting items such as the fluffy pancakes, and the pea fritters. However, we ordered the eggs benedict with ox cheek, as well as the house-made baked beans and chorizo. I ordered a Filter Special coffee, though felt the need to order a side of milk to mix.The food was nice enough, the coffee was enjoyable, and the atmosphere was busily pleasant. Service was acceptable and friendly.All menu prices included GST and service charges, which is always a welcome sight on any Singaporean menu. However, due to the inner-city location, the prices could be considered above average when compared to suburban alternatives.Overall, having compared the atmosphere, service and taste of the fare with the slightly above average prices, I will explore a few more brunch spots before coming back
3
I have been there twice and every time it's too crowded and noisy. The food is just average. What magic can you do to brunch? But the price tag is not cheap. Coffee is famous. I had the cold brew and it's balanced with a touch of fragrance from the orange peel. Service is hard to get, as expected in any busy cafe. Expect queueing and being chased off when you finish meals. Follow me SerenaGourmet on Instagram for the food photo
5
Popped in mid morning for late breakfast. Had friendly staff. Great coffee and good choice on the menu. I really enjoyed my breakfast which was a mushroom/ haloumi/spinach/avo with scrambled eggs on amazing toast. Ordered a second cup of coffee when a downpour of rain hit and waited it out
4
My friends who live in Singapore took me here for a late lunch/brunch. Interesting venue. We had split level seating where half of the group were seated at the same table but sitting half a meter higher than us which was a bit disconcerting. I went for the chilli chicken which was tasty and not that spicy. My friend went for the brunch and that looked more interesting.Great selection of coffees I asked for a Diet Coke and got a very disapproving look. They don't serve cola. So had juice instead.We ordered churros for dessert but they never arrived so cancelled the order. Very busy so expect to wait for a table at peak time.
4
The environment was very crowded and the staff tried to clear up the dishes even if we were not done with the food yet.
The food and the coffee was good however the price expensive. We had to pay around 45 SGD per person.
3
May be I order the wrong type of coffee. I heard that this place has good coffee, after I tried...just..ok. Good atmosphere but not good in service. May be I will go back to try again.
5
This is probably my favourite dessert place! The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so nice! I loved all the food there.
5
Came for brunch and it was amazing, great menu selection for good food and coffee. Everything was done to perfection with amazing flavours
5
Finally found a place with great "aussie/melbourne style coffee!! :-) the cafes interior has a very "melbourne cafe" style which we love.. took us back home :) the food was yummy, coffee was a standout.. if ur an aussie/ melbournian ... check this place out.. it's owned by two very cute aussie guys haha i saw them today ... & the staff were very attentive and so nice.... we were served by kyna.. very cute girl who was extremely friendly and well spoken.. gorgeous girl! Loved the place. Was very happy!
3
Heard about this place & was happy to meet someone here for breakfast. Was disappointed in the limited brunch items; maybe I couldn't find what I really want. Was looking forward to the coffee but it was a let down as it didn't taste as good as I had expected.It was relatively empty when we arrived but became quite crowded by the time we left at about 9:30am
3
Whereever I go, I try to find the best place for a coffee. Common Man Coffee roasters scored high on the internet, so my expectations were high. But I most say, I was dissapointed by the coffee. The venue looks like a real good expresso coffee place and I did like the bar and the whole setting, but the latte was not a latte as I expected it to be. It was more like a cafe au lait or a milk coffee. It was really not strong enough. I know, coming from New Zealand I am spoiled with all the good coffees everywhere, but this was really dissapointing, especially because of the thing I read on the internet. I did enough the cafe itself, but if I a come to Singapore again, I know I just will go to a Starbucks, because you know what you get
2
I ordered the chorizo confit with baked beans, the beans were dry and not cooked. They had very little taste and the bread tasted like it was from last week. Very rubbery! The place is severely understaffed as there were left over meals on most tables and it was difficult to get the waiters attention. We told the manager we were disappointed with the food and she was very lovely and she apologized for the poor service and food. She offered us another meal for free and reduced our bill. We politely declined the free meal and paid for our coffees.
4
I felt like I was at The Grounds of Alexandria when I had breaky at Common Man!Delicious meals and great coffee to go with it too, staff were friendly and meals came out nice and quick. I'll definitely return next time I am in Singapore!
4
Lovely buzzy hub just back from the river, with an Argentinean restaurant Bochinche set just above. Coffee was honestly excellent as was the avo and poached eggs brunch. A friend had the Turkish soft boiled eggs wrapped in filo which are also recommended! There are a handful of tables outside or head in for air con and the hustle inside
3
This place is hyped as one of the best coffees in Singapore and I would have to disagree. The coffee lacks depth, flavor and complexity. It's rather average and nondescript, along with their food.
5
Everyone always talks about the coffee (and it is good), but I have to admit, the hot chips are the best in Singapore.
3
We went to this place at 4.30 p.m. last Saturday. The place was so packed. Only spot we could get was the long table facing street corner. The seat was in the half moon shape. It was super uncomfortable and I was scared to fall down from the chair. The coffee beans was roasted below medium aka second cracks. It made our Flat White & Skinny Latte taste quite weak in term of aroma, acidity, body, flavor and aftertaste. I was expected more for coffees at this place. Wagyu Beef Burger was quite good in terms of quality and taste. The fries that came with was cold. When we told the person who's served this dish. She had a blank face. We end up repeated 3 times til she got it and take away. After that other waiter return the hot fries to us. Fluffy French Toast with ice cream ; when it arrive ice cream was 1/4 melted. Not look really good. But taste was quite good. So, I let's it go. The should serve ice cream in A tiny bowl than top of the toast which quite hot. The raspberries compote was really fresh and tasty. I enjoy this menu the most. The service was slow. The waiting time for food also little slow.
4
I didn't try the food but they do brew a decent cup of coffee here. There's a wide variety of beans on offer. The place seems very popular and had a young, cosmopolitan and trendy vibe. Blissfully powerful airconditioning in this place. A welcome respite if you've been traipsing around Robertson Quay. It's very close to plenty of eateries so a convenient place to do coffee after food.
5
Nestled off the riverbank in Robertson Quay, this has to be one of the best brunch places in Singapore. Dishes are innovative and Super tasty and venue has a very cool, unpretentious vibe. There is usually a line to get in, but I've never had to wait more than 5 mins. It's a relatively big place and turnover is pretty quick. The fish burger, Turkish breakfast and French Toast are all excellent as are the fresh juices and coffee. If you want fresh, innovative, Australian brunch and you don't mind waiting a few mins for a table, definitely come here. TIP: if you arrive around 16:00, you prob won't have to line up at all as the place closes at 18:30, so it's pretty empty by then.
4
One of the coolest place to hang out with family/ friends for a weekend brunch ..Must Try - Veggie Wonderland, Turkish Common man Breakfast & Organic Egg Benedict.Watch out: Its overwhelmingly crowded during the weekends & therefore long waiting time. Reach early for avoid long waiting time
3
Nicely located venue with inside and outside seating. Food is good. Price, for Singapore, reasonable. The restaurant suffers from poor serving staff. Good was very slow in coming and even after a polite reminder some food arrived but not all the food. Nothing is more annoying than an order coming in drubs and drabs. What is done well is undone by the service staff
4
Common Man consistently has a delicious, good quality breakfast (albeit a bit overpriced) The coffee selection is good and they switch it up often. The HUGE downfall is the extremely slow service. It is extremely rare to actually receive your coffee before your breakfast which is part of the brunch experience. Instead it we usually finish our breakfast before it even shows up. Trying to get someone's attention to order or to pay the bill is always a pain as well. Would rank at the top of my breakfast list of they could deliver coffee before food and have more attentive staff
5
This coffee house was packed during my visit, and I can see why. Nice ambience, tasty food, good coffee, and, in general, a friendly waitstaff. There was some communal seating areas that were a nice combo of having seclusion to work and having friendly neighbors. Place was full of 30s-40s professionals, more Westerners than the norm here.My eggs and coffee cost $30 SGD. Same meal in the US would've been closer to $20 SGD
4
This was our first visit to Common Man and we truly enjoyed it.The variety and quality of the coffee and breakfast choices was amazing. Everyone working there was friendly and welcoming.We were however a bit disappointed by the lack of gluten free breakfast choices. The only gluten free item on the menu was on the lunch menu, which was not available until 10:00. We were there at 9:30 and they were not flexible so our friend who is gluten intolerant had to wait 30 minutes to receive her order. This was not a huge deal but a bit surprising for this restaurant.
5
We spent 3 days trying to find a quaint breakfast spot with no luck! Then we found common man... Great service, food and interior design! Definitely recommend a visit!
5
If you love you modern day Italian style coffee then this is the place. The organic eggs benedict is also quite nice. The open early which is perfect for a quiet start to the day!
4
Great coffee!! Ordered a cappuccino - just the right amount of foam versus milk.
Friendly and quite efficient service...
3
Popped in for a meeting aa great coffee. Decor is really good. However be warned it attracts a pretty noisy mums with infants hang out and the concrete floors make it super noisy. Not zen at all.
4
The coffee was good enough for me to want to buy a bag of beans to take home. The breakfast menu was pretty good and healthy too!
5
FABULOUS food, coffee and atmosphere! A little difficult to find if you have no sense of direction when walking. Obviously a local joint with lots of trendy couple with cute kids.
4
A frequent place for tasty servings of Aussie style big breakfasts and consistently good coffee.
I like to order the vegetarian breakfast that has eggs, mushrooms, avocado, haloumi cheese and then order a side of bacon - perfect!
5
You know when you have found a good place to eat,when you have to wait for a seat. When we got seated we had a very tasty and filling common man full breakfast, great coffee, a tad expensive but worth it. A great atmosphere with very busy and friendly staff. A good find
3
The coffee is good, 3/5 but I've tasted better. The coffee seems to have a slight bitter aftertaste but not bad. Yes I would probably have a coffee there if I'm in the area, but won't make a journey out there.It's very noisy in the cafe, the aircon tends to be excessively cold.The food is not healthy too much oil! I wanted to order a kale salad but decided not to as they sautéed the kale.. It's not fresh.Other people had some other dishes and there was a lot of oiliness on the plate once they've finished... The spinach and avocado with egg dish, once again the spinach is sautéed (oily) the poached eggs are served on a buttered bread. I ordered a fresh fruit salad, the salad had icing sugar sprinkled on it! YUK!!! We won't eat there again.
4
Almost all the coffee served in Singapore seems to come from one of those newish coffee pod machines. We walked around the CBD till we found the Swisshotel served freshed ground and brewed coffee - at $11 : (We went straight to the web and found this joint. Located in a business expat section of the city this was a godsend!Good coffee and excellent muesli for those who go crazy after days without either of these stables in the Western diet.Well done team
4
Stumbled upon this place. Ordered an ice latte. The coffee was really good but a bit expensive, near $9. Decor was nice too.
4
Visited here before and again found it popular with couples and families. Good breakfast and lunch menu and efficient service, nice food.
5
A marvellous cafe. Excellent coffee and well prepared and presented food. We arrived early to avoid the queues and had a great experience. They know how to charge and it's certainly not a cheap option but it is well worth it.
5
We had only coffee and Musli for breakfast and know we will be back. Soon.
Packed, noisy to the right level, with quick and welcoming service (even if very busy always). That's the way to do it.
4
Went with a friend, we're both from Melbourne. Felt very similar to the city cafes there. We had the veggie breakfast & granola, both great. Would highly recommend.
5
It is one of the best cafe in Singapore you must visit ! Try uncommon brew coffee if you love the brew, food is great also. The cafe gives you a good vibe, nice for photo and an ideal brunch on weekends. It could be crowded sometimes, but it's really worth to visit ! Strongly recommended !! oh and the price is a little bit pricey
5
So I decided to come here at 8am for a breakfast meeting and it was already great fun. Music blaring. Friendly staff. I already felt like I was going to have a wonderful morning. Food was great. All of the food we ordered looked fantastic and really great vegetarian options such as the museli and yogurt, there is a healthy kale dish, vegetarian haloumi that all looked fantastic, had good portions and tasted great. Highly recommende

From my several visits to Common Man Coffee Roasters I always came with different coffee-lover-friends of mine. One even openly admitted for being coffee snobs and had high coffee standards from being spoilt for choices in Melbourne that he stayed for the last 13 years. Some of them said that the coffee here was very acidic. And the others said that the coffee was the best they tried in the city. But all agreed with me that the coffee here was aromatic, strong yet bright, and had a lingering aftertaste with a hint of fruit.My favourite menu in the house is Organic Eggs Benedict, Veggie Wonderland, and Grilled Boneless Chicken. I reckon Common Man Coffee Roasters as a cool hangout spot, a place to see and be seen. So expect to see me, sassy eater, queuing on the weekends at this alluring establishment and be prepared for bistro-quality food that is on par with its top-notch coffee, and read more at UrbanOutEaters

This little place was all it cracked up to be. There was a small wait but they were attentive and quick to seat us. The breakfast was absolutely outstanding and one of our favorite meals we had out during our trip. It has a busy, loud, city atmosphere that some might not appreciate but we certainly did. I would definitely go back...and that flat white, delicious
4
Food 5, drinks 5, service 3, price 3/4. We are here quite often.They have difficulty taking your order right in one time and they do not apologize when they repeatedly make mistakes. Manager was more professional in this perspective by the way. Food and drinks are expensive but very good
4
We had brunch today, surprising the place was crowded on a Monday late morning. The coffee is good and the brunch is nice.
5
Great for breakfast, but it is by far the best coffee going around in Singapore. Well worth the visit - but it's popular, so be prepared to queue!
5
Enjoyed a delicious breakfast at Common Man recently. Funky cafe which had a great friendly vibe. Staff were quick, attentive and friendly, food was delicious and came out very quickly for our group of 5. Coffee was also excellent. Indoor and outdoor seating. Highly recommend
1
Terrible coffee, mediocre food. surprisingly it's such cafes that still continue to stay in business due to pure hype and hoards of ignorant people who don't have tastebuds.
5
Of course you have to go for their coffee, however its a must to try one of their all day breakfast dishes or if you feel hungry, ask for the wagyu burger with fries!Service is friendly and the ambiance reminds me Soho cafes in NYC
5
Their breakfast is amazing ! Very different combinations and all well prepared. We had Turkish breakfast and veggie breakfast and both was great. They also have a good selection of coffee and you can see how they make it. It's also a very nice and comfortable place to spend a Sunday morning.
4
A short walk from Robertson Quay, we only knew about this place because of TA, and we were glad we'd done our research. Visited three times during our short stay in Singapore. Yes, the coffee's good, but so was the food. Great value. Very popular with locals. Don't be afraid to order off menu, if you haven't got the appetite for a full breakfast. And do try the juices
4
Came here for breaky with my wife and another couple on the morning of New Year's Eve. Coffee was pretty nice - and that's coming from someone who is quite particular about my coffee. My wife said here green tea was pretty good too. I enjoyed a Bloody Mary with my meal, which went down a treat. I had the pancakes...some of the best I've ever had. My wife said her meal (organic braised of cheeks) was super tasty too! Service was excellent. Ambiance reminded us of something we would see back home in Perth AUS. BUT, a meal and drink for 4 people came to about SGD180! Massively overpriced..
4
Came here on a weekend for morning coffee, it was pretty packed already! So queued and waited for a bit (service was very efficient) and was seated less than 5 minutes after.We ordered picolos and Eggs with braised Ox (if i'm not mistaken) and Oh wow, yummy! We weren't expecting it to be that good! Definitely one of the places that I will go to over and over :
5
If you are looking for an amazing breakfast and EXCELLENT coffee in Singapore, look no further! Although a bit of a trek from our hotel, we went back a second day, as I needed to try more of the menu - and of course we needed our coffee hit! They use Five Senses Coffee here, which I will admit is owned by good friends, so I am a little biased. However the food is also excellent, the location is a little out of the way, but a pleasant stroll along the river from Clarke Quay. My only complaint is the service could be a little more attentive
5
A very popular place for breakfast. I don't often queue for breakfast but it is worth the wait. An interesting menu, good quality food and excellent service.
5
Great place for food and coffee. Go for a late brunch when the crowds thin. We had the burger and the veggie breakfast and it was a decent amount of food.
4
The coffee here is made Indonesian style, they prefer black or with milk..so to get a "western" coffee I ordered a cappochino- excellent.  Breakfast is good, the tastes are different for sausage and Canadian bacon but a refreshing change. Bring your newspaper, they won't rush you. Service is great
5
The location of this place is not central, however it suited us perfectly as it was within a short walking distance of our hotel. We had great coffee, food and service so would highly recommend to people looking for a quality breakfast with lots of menu options
3
We tried this place because our friends raved and raved about it.We thought it was ok. The ambience is good, the seating is great and there is a very nice vibe about the place.But there wasnt anything dramatically special about the food.We had a bunch of salads, all veg, some juices I think and coffee obviously - and all of it was ok.Didnt stand out for us, but mind you I am not saying we were disappointed
3
I'm amazed that this place is so popular given the prices. 2 breakfasts plus 2 coffees for $70 SGD: certainly a record for me for a cafe breakfast in Singapore. Food is ok but not fantastic. Coffee was presented well, but seemed to taste a little sour and took a long time to arrive. I probably won't come back here in a hurry given the high prices (nearby cafes are quite a bit cheaper for similar quality)
4
This is my favorite breakfast haunt. Love the granola, full breakfast, Turkish breakfast and eggs Ben. Downside, not the best coffee I've had and tables are crammed together so it's easy to partake in the conversation next to you. Parking lot in the same building has awkward turns and bays are very limited.

Just went yesterday for brunch, ordered freshly squeezed juice, latte and pulled pork while other friends ordered something else. Conclusion: Disappointed, overpriced.The freshly squeezed juice (Kale Spinach Apple S$8++) was a very small size, contained all the leftover pulb (fibre) that they didn't throw away, it was really difficult to drink the juice with so much in it. Next, Latte ($5++) was burned that with overpowered strong burned taste. I am a coffee lover and I love to use strong espresso coffee bean to make my coffee with my Italian coffee machine at home. I don't mind sour coffee but burned coffee really tasted badly. My friend had to add in so much sugar to reduce the burned taste that the latte had become a sweet and burned coffee. I was looking forward to pulled pork bun ($24++) but it turned out tasteless pulled pork with overpowered salad sauce taste - something like metallic taste in tap water. I wasn't sure what did they use to make the salad with cucumber but they should really taste it before serving customer. If it is called "Pulled Pork Bun", the main dish should be the pork rather than the metallic taste cucumber salad.We were seated at the end of the tables that the chairs are on the wall side where everyone went in and out between tables with just maybe 5-10 inches gaps, in the end people from the left and right tables all had to pull/ push the table to get to toilet or out from the restaurant. Had brunch in such squeezed environment was really uncomfortable. Note: $ ++ In Singapore many restaurants charge 10% service charge and another 7% GST (there is GST on the 10% Service Charge too)i.e. ($24 Pulled Pork + 10% Service Charge) + 7% GST = $26.40+7% = $28.25The only thing I found was average was the service staff were quite friendly
4
The space, ambience and the food are great. even the little bottles if water and sugar syrup served in tiny jars within cups are lovely to use. But the prices!! For eggs and toast, muesli with yoghurt and 3 cups of tea/ coffee - approx 75 dollars! Yowch! Not again methinks
4
I was at the Mohamed Sultan area and needed a bite. I popped by this coffee place. We ordered the following:- Croq Monsieur: $16. This is really good. Ham and béchamel sauce in between croissant which is toasted. Really good. - Latte: $5. Coffee is nice and tasty.- Cold Brew: $8. When this was served, I thought I was having a cocktail and not a coffee. There’s an orange peel in the coffee! The orange peel imparted a mild citrusy flavour to the coffee, which is good.I spent $34.Although it’s a little pricey, the food quality is good and the coffee here are good.Nice
5
Awesome food and coffee. Probably the best coffee in singapore. The place is cozy, nice interiors, exCellent staff. Big breakfast my favorite. Will always recommend this place
4
serves up a decent coffee. common man does their roast darker than i prefer. safe choice but nothing exciting. try the common man burger to share. its yummy.
4
Good food and coffee to start your morning. It's about 15min walk starting from Orchard central down Killiney road. Now, they start doing coffee making and knowledge classes to public in case someone is interested.
3
I ordered the the pulled pork bun and it was horrendous. The pulled pork was dry, tasteless and diluted. I would recommend that it should be stewed longer with more gravy in order for it to be something to "wow" about. Apart from the food, the place was overstaffed but the service was bad. Staff were very inattentive and we waited 20 minutes for our dessert. I will be back but definitely not for the pulled pork.
4
We always try to rush over, even though it is the weekend, to avoid the long queues. The food is nice, big portions - but expected given the price tag of >$20 for breakfast.The flat white is really nice, robust and tasty. We go with the kids, and have visited this place more than 10 times over the past year.The hours listed here are not right, they close at 6pm not 7pm.They are affiliated to Tiong Bahru bakery, the incredible breads - we love the thick, chunky sourdough bread - are freshly delivered every morning.Best foods to order:LOVE LOVE the Organic eggs Benedict.Purr-fect every time. The eggs are slightly runny. Not at all oily.Lots of lovely rocket salad to go with 2 slices of chucky sourdough bread, the soft braised beef cheeks and two eggs. YUM.After a meal like this, I can pretty much skip lunch :
1
For a place claiming by name to be about coffee, they failed. We had finished our overpriced meals and asked for the bill before the disgusting sour coffee arrrived. It was crowded and poor service but people seem to go there. I dont know why. Even people next to us were asking about their coffees as they finished their meals too.
2
Coffee was sour. I am not used to this type of coffee. The ambience of the place is nice though. The table next to ours had burger and the all day breakfast. I thought the food looked good but not sure if they taste as good as they look
1
Too expensive. Bad services. Very crowded.... what else do you need? we are there for relaxing Sunday brunch but didn't get relaxed at all. After the long wait, finally got seats. While we are STILL eating, the waiting stuffs keep coming to our table to pick up empty glasses and whatever the things they can grab. Unbelievable!Never return.
3
We arrived for breakfast at 8.30am on a public holiday and all the regular tables were already taken, leaving the round island booth that seats 8-10 and a long high counter which was totally uncomfortable.Not much choice for a Breakfast selection.Considering it's named a coffee place, what was offered on the Coffee section of the menu was, Black or White coffee.We took the chance to ask for Latte, Capuccino and Mocha and were all served as we ordered.Other than the Mocha which tasted reasonable, (possibly cos the mocha powder had masked the coffee) the Latte and Capuccino had sour undertones.That was rather unpleasant.I would never go back to this place agai
5
With early breakfast hard to find in Singapore, and our hotel's "award winning" buffet was just slightly better than a Hampton with an egg bar we were delighted to find a local roaster with the most amazing breakfasts From homemade granola to eggs Benedict made with uber tender ox cheeks and fresh organic free range eggs and some of the best coffee and juice squeezes that this father of a former barista has ever tasted. Well done sirs! And by the way, great crema art
5
Polite and friendly services. Serves very good egg benedict (if you are a fan of egg ben like me). I ordered their organic eggs benedict with braised oxcheek and I really like it.
5
Perfect ambiance, perfect coffee, perfect food..what more do you need on Sunday. They don't take reservations, just walk ins, which I love!
4
If you have missed your breakfast, you may still come here as they serve all day breakfast!
Big portion served with nicely done scrambled eggs (my favourite) or any other eggs cooked to your preference!
4
Restaurant was crowded when we arrived and we were seated at the high stools. Later on we saw someone left and requested to be moved to a table which was quickly arranged. Good service. Ordered breakfast platter, pancake and juices. Juices were very good. Breakfast platter was good tooPancakes a tad disappointing as it was drenched n soggy which I do not prefer. Overall a nice place.
4
I came here on the weekend, around brunch time. The sign was so clear, "grab and go" or "seat and eat". I ordered mango-vanilla panna cotta, so yummy yet refreshing. Coffees were nice. On the weekend, this place mostly full of expatriates. A bit pricey compare to others, but not a big deal.
4
I purposedly stay in a hotel near Martin Road, so that I can have a good cup of coffee every morning. And yeah! I am pleasantly satisfied with the ambience, service, and the coffee! the interior of Common Man is very warm and welcoming, I could stay there for a long time, but I had meetings to attend. I tried their 'white' (cafe latte) and take away their Cold Brew.... very nice blend! very smooth and the barista's skill is impeccable! oh and they also have an academy for barista training.. looking forward to my next caffeine fix at Common Ma
5
I went here based on recommendation from a friend. Arrived on a Saturday around 11am without reservation, which i was expecting that there is going to be a queue. Luckily there was none and we can get a table right away. Location is a but further from MRT (clarke quay - 10mins walk) but there is option to take buses anyway. Location is quite easy to reach.Service wise this place is really good. They have quite number of staffs that are on the floor, so didnt have any issue with that. The staff were also informative when i asked a lot abt their coffee and food. Gave good recommendation as well.I ordered Picollo latte. Hands down - the best one i've tried in the city. But take note that their coffee is bit strong bcs they are using based of 2 shots of espresso, whereby most coffee shops only use 1. As for the meal - i ordered eggs benedict with ox cheek!!! Surprisingly very delicious. Cooked perfectly in a perfect portion. Price-wise after ordering coffee and meal came down to around $35-40 per person. But really depends on the meal that you ordered though. This place is child friendly too - i've seen many guest with their kids on the child seats. Wifi provided.I would definitely come again for sure! And if you are after a good strong coffee or american breakfast, do come here! At least once. It is a must!!!
5
Like your coffee with a serious side of hipster vibes? You're in the right place then. All day breakfast favorites and an expanded menu after lunch make this a great place for the fashion victims and too cool for school crowd.Come here for the coffee and honestly good menu. Stay for the people watching.Overly cropped pants, tattoos, rompers and sundresses encouraged
5
Common Man has got to be one of the best coffee places we have been to. No, they are not best interior wise, but the coffee is top shelf. Beside espresso and white coffee, a must to try is their filter coffee. Excelent. While there we managed to meet the barista champion, Miss Xin, which was a real delight. Fountain of coffee knowledge and wonderful personality. The food is excellent, and the service is quite prompt. Highly recommended. Give it a try.
5
We came here 3 times in 4 days on a recent trip to Singapore. The coffee is absolutely spot on and came out of top of several other notable places (in our opinion), so much so that we bought some beans to take home with us.What we also noticed was how incredibly efficiently this place is run - on two of the days, it was the long weekend and the place was packed, yet coffee orders were taken in under a minute after being seated and the coffee was delivered within 3 minutes. This is top notch service, and all delivered with a smile and even nods of recognition. (On one of these days we had a coffee at a nearby 'name' place and the service was woefully disorganised and we waited 20 minutes for a coffee that was OK at best).Breakfasts were excellent and varied - large servings too. The winner was definitely the eggs benedict on osso bucco. I would never have thought of this combo but it worked really well. It's not that hard to get to but it does take a bit of effort. Clarke Quay MTR then walk in the direction of Robertson Quay pretty much as far down as you go, then at Verre wine bar turn right and its on the t intersection at the top of that street. Probably a good 15 minute walk from CQ but absolutely worth it, in my opinion. Given the average price of a cup of coffee is 5 SGD ++ I much prefer to know that it's actually going to taste decent!
4
Suggested by friend back at home, he wanted me to buy some beans from this coffee shop, I ended spoiled myself with their superb latte and juicy chilli chicken for lunch. Super friendly staff, oh and free coffee and doughnut for the unemployed
4
I ordered the breakfast platter, pancake, a glass of Americano and ice cappuccino. The food was good, service was excellent, but the coffee just ok and maybe not suitable for kids. Between table is too close and i can hear exactly what the other table was talking about. If u are a commuter, must go by taxi to get there. The nearest subway is Sommerset and about 1.5km.
4
I had brunch here on a late Good Friday morning, where it was packed to the brim and there was a queue. Fortunately service was efficient and we got seat after less than 10min.I shared a breakfast platter and truffle fries and tried their coffee. I have nothing to complain about in the food department. In particular, I enjoyed the bratwurst (although I'm not usually a fan of sausages) and hash and crispy bacon. My only gripe about my hearty brunch brunch was that I thought the food was a tad pricey and compared to other similar western/cafÃ©/brunch I've visited, there was less value for money here. No doubt a pleasant and scrumptious brunch, probably one I will enjoy as an occasional treat.
4
Really good coffee and attentive service as well as excellent brunches.What's not to like!! To find a cafe this good in this part of town was a great bonus as my place of work is nearby. Have become a regular here.Slightly pricey but at least you do get what you pay for
5
We openly admit to being coffee snobs and have high coffee standards from being spoilt for choice in Melbourne but here we were delighted. It was the first good coffee we had been served since leaving Australia 2 weeks earlier. We found it mentioned on TA and also in a Singapore guide book. We felt right at home there. Super decor and had breakfast there twice it was delicious, a little pricey but seems that is the norm in Singapore. Great job Common Man. Hope to visit again one day
5
Only had one layover in Singapore, and stopped by this joint. Staff are so knowledgable about coffee, and the breakfast they recommended was one of the most delicious, interesting dishes I have ever had. Can't wait to come back next year when I return to Asia
2
My eggs benedict arrived at the table barely lukewarm and on a chipped plate. We waited a further 15 minutes for my partner's breakfast to arrive, again on a chipped plate, by which time my breakfast was cold and unappetising. I much prefer restaurants with the ability to serve two simple breakfasts simultaneously. We spent $55 and left with no intention of going back
5
I'm used to paying this sort of price coming from an expensive country. However, it could be a point of contention in Singapore where food is generally cheaper. However the food and coffee is absolutely fantastic and well worth the price. The service staff are very friendly and accommodating. This place is busy so anticipate a potential wait.
4
Went to Common Man Coffee Roasters for breakfast. I had the Common Man Veggie Wonderland (minus the eggs) with a cappuccino. The service was good and the ambience was relaxed.Others at my table had the Turkish Common Breakfast, Common Man Big Breakfast and baked beans with rocket and toast. They chose to drink iced coffee, hot chocolate and a latte. We all agreed that the coffee was perfect and the food was great!The bill came up to $14
4
Nonetheless as the title says. Possibly one of the best coffee I've tasted in Singapore. Brunch food was also fantastic, with their Turkish Common Breakfast as my favourite. Eggs Ben was highly recommended too and it did not disappoint. Ambience was good too, with good service despite the crowd. Will definitely return if not for the long queue later in weekends
5
really liked the breakfast. the coffee was good, got the grounds to go as well. The service was alright, they tried to make it all work for us.
5
Great coffee, great service, great food, cool cafe culture in down town Singapore. This place knows coffee and what their customers are looking for without being pretensions or too hipster, cant wait to return.
5
Great coffee & epic proportion of our fave brunch choice - Common Man Pancake (generous sprinkle of walnuts, caramel & sliced banana) + The Organic Eggs Benedict .We came bit too late for sunday brunch (and 11.30 am, closer to lunch actually :p ) and there was a line. Very friendly waitress (despite the place was super packed and super busy) We were on staycation and walked from Studio M (5-10 min walk), def.would come back for more! Highly recommended ! :
3
It's a holiday and the queue is 15 minutes just before noon. Inside there's a delightful buzz and delicious smells of freshly roasted coffee.Service is efficient and good and the food tasty and well presented. The seating is not comfortable and the whole place has the feel of being a yuppie place to see and be seen. But expensive and hence the crowd of young rich kids and expats. So, yes it's good, not sure it's worth the expense.
4
Went for breakfast today and was lucky to find a table. I've passed here before and found a bit of a queue outside.Food was good and came pretty quickly. Unsurprisingly the coffee was good too!Definitely worth a look for a hearty breakfast/brunch and decent coffee and a great place for people watching ..
4
Always wanted to come for brunch but impossible to get a table. Came here for lunch today. Food was average at best, but mostly disappointing. We had the quinoa salad and fish burger. Lack of flavor, average quality. Do not order the churros by any means. It was hard, not crispy, and poor dough flavor overall. The chocolate dip tasted like it came from a bottle. Poor presentation too with paper cups - esp for the price you're paying. Coffee, on the other hand, is excellent
4
Friends recommended this place and we were glad they did. The staff are really friendly, the coffee is good and the place has a great atmosphere. There are lots of funky touches, like giving customers extra water in what looks like an old brown medicine bottle when they see that your glass is getting empty. The food menu has some really interesting and unusual dishes, which we will definitely return to sample, and also some delicious looking cakes. It's not cheap, but it is quality
4
I like the food but not the coffee. It was sour. I ordered a flat white and then latte, just to make sure. Well, I think it's the coffee bean that they used. The cafe is very cozy. Food is great. I would re-visit them again for their food
4
Great breakfast/brunch selection on the menu, top notch coffee, friendly and accommodating service. We arrived on a Saturday 2PMish and had a very minimal wait to be seated and served, despite the restaurant being rather busy. Highly recommend the Veggieland breakfast, and can't go wrong with any of the coffee options. And if you prefer strong (other options a plenty) and flavorful coffee, look no further than Common Man Coffee
4
I've visited this cafe a couple of times, still ranks as my favourite venue for brunch. The Organic Eggs Benedict and Common Man Pancakes are a must-try! I always return and never fail to order the same items.Coffee is also delicious and fragrant. The only setback is the communal seating may not be ideal for private conversations or some quiet time.
5
You normally have to decide on the coffee or the food..... But Common Man is great for both! Very friendly staff, excellent coffee and delicious brunch and full menu. Best veggie breakfast option in Singapore!
4
Good coffee,quite busy, staff efficient and helpful
There were a lot of people in the shop and it was cramped in places
5
Nice little find, great coffee and the crab salad a huge success. Good atmosphere with fast service. All day breakfast is a winner for that post night out cute.
5
Great coffee, delicious food. Staff is very professional. Espresso well prepared. Pourover is one of the best I have ever had.
4
I like the steps leading up to the place and the vibes it transmits the moment the server opened the door for us. It shouts exciting and hip in a positive way. Great coffee and breakfast. However many seats are without back support so I don't think you'd sitting there for long
3
Being a coffee addict, this is a place that we visit a lot . This place does have the word "Coffee" in its name so you would expect to get a great cuppa here and it does deliver. In many ways, the coffee served here is very close to the brew you find in Australia and if that is the kind of coffee you are looking for, then you will be delighted at Common Man. Food comes in fairly large portions so if you are not a big eater, you can probably share your food. The menu is interesting though some things might be a tad over flavourful for me, for example the french toast and pancakes are drenched in sauce such that you can't actually taste the toast and pancakes itself. Having been here a lot, I must say that the sourdough bread and eggs can sometimes be fantastic and there are days when its just average. But I think this difference is only noticeable after you have been here a lot.If you are coming here, go early if you can else there will be a line. There are not that many tables and quite a few of the seats are at the counter. It opens at 8 am which is great for early risers. Parking can be an issue - fairly limited coupon parking on Martin Place and at Muhammad Sultan Road. Else, you can park closer to the SRT and walk over.Service is fairly prompt - but probably also a little skewed towards trying to move the crowd as quickly as possible so when its busy, you may feel a little pressurised to leave quickly and not be able to hang around as long as you like. Can't quite blame the staff for this, especially when there's a line outside the door.The main grouse of this restaurant is the price. Be prepared that you will be walking out of the place with a spend of approximately $30++ per person for breakfast (1 meal and 1 coffee). The price for the coffee is acceptable in comparison to the places around this area, but it is a fairly hefty bill for the food items. Is it good food? Yes. But would I queue for it and feel good each time I leave - maybe not. At least not right at the end when the bill arrives
4
location - Martins road, building has CP but if packed, its painful to walk (should it rain) only coupon parking available along the Mohamed Rd area.premise - nice decor, i liked the loosely designed seats which is very interestingstaff - nice smiles and allfood - eggs ben..... WINNER. portion was good and tasted like close perfection (eggs were not brittle enough to me)crowd - mainly non locals.... literally counted and at least 70% were tourists / expats (myself included)verdict - may go again but there are other good roasters around with the crowd that i prefe
5
I love this place!!!The flat white is the best I have ever had. I have tried all of the top rated coffee shops in Singapore. Nothing beats the Common man coffee. I have spent hours working here on my laptop. The food is all clean and healthy. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The deco of this resturant is also really cool
4
Dined here with my family this morning. Chatted with the waitress while my wife went to park the car and asked for recommendations. I was told that the common man veggie wonderland, Turkish and full breakfast are all time favourites among the regular patrons. Upon entering the place, I noticed that the seats were ergonomically designed and they have optimised the space well to accommodate the patrons with out compromising comfort. Good job!The single page menu, cutlery, condiments, a bottle of water were already present at the table. Excellent way to save both the patron and staff's time and effort. The staff prompted us to order our drinks before placing the orders for the mains. That's very efficient!I ordered the veggie breakfast, which had two organic eggs, avacado, roasted tomatoes, halloumi, spinach and mushroom while my wife ordered the pancakes. The serving was huge, definitely very filling. The scrambled egg was perfectly cooked. It wasn't runny or over cooked. The pancake was fantastic. The salted caramel sauce with caramelised bananas, walnuts and the nutty crumbles with berry compote really made the dish as one of the finest pan cakes I have tasted. I had an ice latte (double shot) and it was nothing short of fabulous. The service was excellent. The staff was attentive, efficient and friendly. The dishes were reasonably priced too. Best brunch place, hands down
4
We were a little worried by the long queue outside but being just two of us, we were quickly ushered in and given seats by the window. We had the Veggie Wonderland with eggs sunny side up and tried the Pepita toast and the Sourdough bread. We also ordered two pots of filter coffee (they strongly recommended we not add milk to the coffee!)The food was excellent - a gorgeous platter of baby spinach, grilled Portobello Mushroom and tomatoes, sliced spiced avocado, pan fried Halloumi, and a fat slice of soft bread with two eggs sunny side up. It tasted fresh and delicious! The coffee was really good too, but I still needed the milk and sugar.Overall, I really enjoyed the experience here - food was good, service was friendly and efficient, I would want to go back
5
Common Man Roasters ticks many boxes. Its lively, has a fresh menu with generous portions, great service that is quick even on busy weekend. Reasonably priced for Singapore.
5
I regularly visit this lively restaurant for breakfast. Rather than the usual bacon or salmon and eggs, the menu offers so much more. I love the Turkish breakfast, with phyllo wrapped poached egg nest. Service is great too.
4
Very nice industrial design, very nice food and amazing coffee. The price is a bit expensive but everything about the place support that price.
4
Food was good but a little pricey. Location needs some walking but it was worth it. Had the Common Man Full Breakfast and I could not finish it. Share if you can.
5
Went there during our recent visit to Singapore and that was the best breakfast, by far !! The Common Man Veg breakfast was a delight! The mushrooms and tomatoes were cooked perfectly, the Spinach and avocado a perfect match, and the poached eggs were perfect. The coffe was also great and if you approach the barista(s), they will thorowly explain you the type of coffee that they are using and why.Don't be too late on the weekend, as you might have to wait quite some time to get seated
5
This is now my top Sunday brunch place in Singapore, they really have it right. Big portions, great menu and well cooked food. The service is also very good, you can tell someone has spent a lot of time making sure the team there pay attention to the detail and the experience for the customer is great. I liked the ambiance a lot. And of course if you have room after the main course try the churros.No reservations on weekends, so if you want a table go around 11am and then again after 130pm........or you will have to wait but its not a long wait

I loved the ambience at Common Man Coffee Roasters. It really has a simple yet welcoming aura to it. I'd read that the queues can get very long but we were lucky as we were ushered straight in to sit at the bar which I definitely think is the best seat in the house as it truly allows you to savour the experience of having a 'true' barista at work.It's obvious that the baristas at Common Man Coffee Roasters take their jobs seriously and it truly is a work of art to see them at work. I could've sat there for hours and just watched them! I have to admit that I'm not a coffee connoiseur but the back room coffees definitely intrigued me. The coffees were a tad bitter for me but definitely very aromatic and full of flavour

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Rightly said, my friend brought me here. Options were pretty extensive - I (health nut) went for the granola whereas she the croissant croque monsieur. Her hubby had plain toast & jam with team to soothe a slight tummy toil. The granola won't get top marks for presentation - big blob of greek yoghurt atop a medium mound of toasted oats, dried & fresh fruits (pineapple, melon, raspberries). But it made up ground in taste & texture - crunchy, juicy, soft, tangy, sweet, sour - one big mardi-gras in the mouth. Had a bite of the croque monsieur - since it'd gone cold, the pastry was limp, ham kinda rubbery and bechamel sauce gluggy. Would have been nicer piping hot. Price-wise - a bit steep but then, the modern common man seemingly has deeper pockets and seeks better offerings. Decor-wise - relaxed & welcoming with the 2 eagles at the entrance. And the dog too - yes, the dog

Good food generally. So much to choose from here in Singapore so..... It doesn't stand out. But over all a nice meal. Servers are attentive and helpful,which is needed when you need to request your coffee order that seems to have been mis placed. Not a fan of eating my breakfast with out my coffee!I might add the coffee (when we got it ) is not everyone coffee. It unique, strong and intense flavor but tasty. Busy place. Be prepared to dine with strangers at peak times. The big round table is kinda fun way to meet new people and enjoy other people's conversation. Lol. Enjoy your breakfast

I'll preface this review by saying that this is not a value breakfast joint and if you want cheap breakfast then don't come. 3-4 Stars for Food, 5 for Coffee.Despite that this place really is excellent. My server was friendly but not overly knowledgeable about the coffee/brew options but the barista actually came over and discussed the coffee choice and different ways he'd tried brewing it for several minutes with me. The food was good, not amazing, and could have been served a bit hotter (temperature wise), and wasn't cheap. I didn't feel ripped off or anything though: I knew what I was in for.The coffee on the other hand was excellent. They had an impressive selection of single origin roasts that were processed in a number of different ways. The Ethiopia Yirgacheffe was delightful in the pour-over style. It is indeed supposed to have that light color and has a flavor that has hints of fruit and a finish reminiscent of Earl Grey Tea.Having been a barista I closed my tab after breakfast and moved up to the bar seating by the espresso bar to get one more coffee and talk to William (the barista). He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and precise with what he was doing. All in all I had a short black and two different single origins and left happy. I spent about $50 SGD but over half of that was the food.Expensive but delicious; definitely for coffee lovers

Coffee is the best. Breakfast is heavenly. You can eat and just roll yourself home. It is best if you go in groups so that you can each order something different and share. verything is good on the menu.
4
Coffee in the restaurant was really great, the breakfast was beautifully done, totally enjoyed the whole experience.
2
Its a nice hip place. It's all hype, overrated and does nothing for my taste. Colored water coffee and dried up chicken breast and ham & cheese in a croissant trying to pass off as a croque monsieur. Well, well, I don't want the chef to insult my knowledge of food. Once beaten ,twice shy. I won't go again
5
My fave hangout place for good cuppa coffee and hearty healthy food, not on the cheap side. Common Man Coffee Roaster, a mouthful and who knew I could remember places more than 2 words long, just call them by its acronym CMCR which by the way Singaporeans love giving acronyms to almost everything. MUST have Latte. Hi, I am Becky and I am an addict. To their latte that is. Brioche as desert. Crab salad is pretty stunning and generous with its crab portion. Great place for people watching. Great place to tap tap tap tap on your comp, though i suggest place hogging during off-peak hours.Tips:- Its always a long Q at brunch on weekends. So join the Q or come early. Turnover is pretty fast as they have done an amazing job to managing crowd with the way its tables are laid out. - Cant be bothered to Q, get a latte to go or try weekday lunch- prefer a sit down, head to their other joint, same consistency to good cuppa latte at 40 Hands in Tiong Bahru Singapore (caveat, its also crowded during peak on weekends)- not a coffee lover...... really? why not? its not too late to start and if your going to try, might as well choose the best to start with- closes at 6p

I came here for brunch on a weekday at around 10 am. I had a hot chocolate which was delicious - smooth, even milk consistency with dark chocolate. There was also latte art which was beautiful! I also had the organic eggs benedict with the braised ox tail - the hollandaise was a little bit too sour, but the ox tail was nice, tender, flat portions on bread. The eggs were touch uneven in execution, one gooey in the middle, another half solid.Unfortunately my sister's long black was a bit over extracted, making it ratherbitter. The mango pannacotta however was great! Smooth, creamy with a great acidic pineapple accompaniment. The best "breakfast dessert" for the morning!Service was standard, but the interior was industrial and modern, very cool. It was a rather nice spot for brunch, but be prepared to spend around $50+ for breakfast and drinks for two
5
My family of 5 had a 3 night stopover on Singapore on our way to Thailand. I read the reviews online and this place seemed the best to go to and I am so grateful that I did. My husband and I had the granola with fresh fruit and kids had the pancake with banana and berry coulis. Both were exceptional. Fresh english breakfast tea served in a pot.I highly recommend eating here!!! It was so good we ate breakfast their twice.
5
I love Australian-style brunches (not the extravagant boozy Singapore style ones!) and this place is up there with the best I've been to here and in Australia! It's a big call but they just get everything right. Coffee is first class, service is better than average for Singapore, food is amazing and even the crockery is nice (that's a male talking!). Only issue is it's got too popular and there are decent queues at weekends but they seem to move quite quickly and it's definitely worth the wait! Enjoy!
5
Great brunch. I especially love the breakfast option with Halloumi and also green pea fritters - both unusual menu items you can't really find anywhere else. The atmosphere and service are great and coffee is yummy. Have seen that the place gets really really crowded on the weekend though so always tried to go during the week instead
2
When a coffee, two orange juices, two soft drinks and two burgers come to S$96 you know something just has to be wrong! What kind of alternative universe did I step into?Well, all-in-all I felt robbed. Thoroughly robbed. My waiter made a great play of helping me select the perfect coffee and the perfect type of percolation. What came to the table was the kind of muddy water I could quite easily have received at a kopitiam down the road. No flavour, no aroma, no promised wow factor. About as good as a slap in the face with a dead haddock.The orange juice and burgers were fine but for that kind of price I would have expected it to be a level beyond.I quietly paid the bill and left never to return. This place really should just put a sub sign above the door "caveat emptor". You'll feel robbed when you leave
5
I love this place. The wait will be worth it. The coffee is top notch and I love the eclectic choice of breakfast offerings. I had the eggs Benedict with braised Oxford cheek. Fantastic! Fruit pancakes were great as well. Little spendy but good food is good food
3
We visit Common Man often. Nice atmosphere and we enjoy the food. I guess the only gripe we have is the speed of service, which is a little disjointed and slow.
5
Great find, decent choice and a really interesting menu. Wife had Turkish breakfast with crumbed fetta and and a savoury kadeyfi. I had the veggie breakfast with decent slab of mushroom, 2 eggs and more
5
As it was approaching 11am when we arrived I suppose we should class this as brunch. The breakfast menu was still available and I had the full breakfast with bacon, eggs, sausage, tomatoes, chorizo hash brown, mushrooms, toast. It was slightly more than I needed but was so delicious I finished it anyway. I had a cappuccino and my wife a cafe latte. Check out the presentation in my photos.We'd heard strong recommendations for the pancakes but I certainly don't regret choosing the full breakfast. Perhaps next time we'll go for the pancakes
4
This place is not for a quick fix, wham bam thank you sir madam for your time and espresso shot. This is a place to sit down with friends and go HMMMMM WHAT WILL I HAVE. MAYBE ILL HAVE THATNAHHHHH PANCAKES SOUND GOODPancakes were pretty good. Crunchy bits with fresh berries. It's a nice place to take your time with fancy coffee. My ristretto came with a small vial of sparkling water as a chaser. This place isn't cheap, but you'll feel nice if you sit outside because there's no one out there to out-style you because all the stylish people are sitting inside being cool. So... this place isn't cheap, food good, nice coffee, chill place if you're outside. The inside is pretty noisy
5
We ordered the vegetarian breakfast and the full breakfast as well as a coffee and a pot of tea... it was all so tasty and probably the best breakfast we've had. Mind you at $82 it would want to be. Resturant has a great vibe and seems to be popular with expats. Bit tricky with public transport so get a taxi. We paid a little over $5 from City Hall
5
First off this place has invested so much in decorating the place, from the interiors to the cutlery. Love the presentation of the food too, super photogenic place!So now to the food! We ordered:1. Pancakes - $20It's pretty expensive for pancakes but it's very yummy! It has salted caramel and berries, highly recommended!2. French toastComes with a scoop of ice cream, taste pretty amazing too!3. Green tea and peppermint teaTheir tea come in a very nice presentation, looks super legit! The teapot is super heavy and the teas are not from tea bags, they use loose tea leaves. 4. CoffeeI didn't have the coffee. But my friends had it, and I only hear good things about it! Also their filter coffee comes in fancy bottle.Overall - I really love this place except it's pretty steep prob can go on special occasions. Good hang out place! We sat outside so it's quieter and it's not that hot
5
Waited abit before we got a table, but compared to many other cafes, the wait here was absolutely reasonable.FoodHad their breakfast set and a fruit juice and latte. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Im normally a big eater so the portion was really good! I actually couldnt finish (even thou i really wanted to!)Did not have to wait long for food.AmbienceAnother thumbs up. I loved how the entire place was really cosy. Setting of the place, great as well!ServiceGreat. Everyone was really warm. Regardless of who spoke to us, they were really friendly! Really appreciated the hospitable service!Only my first time there but im already very sure that im gonna be heading back again very soon.

Nice cafe styled as reclaimed industrial. Place is simple, elegant,rustic, functional. Smaller menu with a good variety of food, which helps order come out quickly (almost as fast as a hawker). Place isn't cheap but not bad, what I'd expect to pay in a nice cafe in a big city. Coffee is brewed extra strong (not to the level of espresso) and a little extra hot water comes separate to get it to your preferred strength.Place is popular, and indoor table seating is filling up by 9am but there is plenty of seating at two bar set-ups. If there is a morning downpour you'll likely be rewarded for venturing out with a little extra quite
4
This was my first visit to Common man coffee. I had a flat white and a full breakfast. the coffee was fantastic especialy in the terracotta cup. The breakfast was delicious as well with suprising twists to the hash brown and beans (with chorizo yum). Service was average. Needed to get their attention alot of the time. Nice chilled out atmosphere and design. Not sure about the eagles out side the door though.Overall a good experinece. Will be Back
5
Came here with a group of friends for lunch and coffee and it did not disappoint! Delicious food - I had a tasty salad that I would 100% have again! Can't wait to come at the weekend and try out the breakfast after reading such great reviews on here and word of mouth. Stylish venue. Slow service, but at least you aren't rushed to leave! Very enjoyable
1
Protip: try to serve tables at same time and if a table has for coffees use a tray or similar don't deliver one by one. Painfully slow service.
5
Visited this place with the family on the usual family Sunday Lunch. The service standard was great and the quality of the food was outstanding. We had breakfast portions as well as the flattened chicken and overall the food was of very high quality. Cant go wrong with PS cafe run places as I am discovering.Prices are expensive, but if a quality experience is what one is after, PS cafe restaurants don't usually disappoint.The desert menu however could be improved considering it is a PS Cafe group outlet.Will definitely visit this more often.I enjoy reviewing restaurants and Hotels so that others may benefit , I hope you enjoyed this review
5
On our last morning in Singapore we ate at the cafe that could easily have become a regular. Common man clearly does great coffee. But their breakfast/brunch menu was equally a match. I was very grateful to the friendly gents at the adjoining table who suggested the turkish breakfast - it was sensational. All the meals were very generous.
4
It's so nice to see a menu with refreshing breakfast and brunch items! The Common Man Veggie Wonderland was so incredibly good! The atmonsphere is lovely, bright, open, music is really easy, the staff are super friendly. All round top notch experience. Will be going back for sure
5
Had breakfast there as was close to Hotel. Food was great as was service. Coffee was a little disappointing but was better than alot of the coffee we had experienced. Being kiwis the cafe had a kiwi fell to us. Would definitely return and try more from the men
4
My partner and I are in Singapore at least once a month and without fail we always visit CMCR. Undoubtedly some of the best breakfast choices i've seen on offer and the coffee is even better still. Its very popular at weekends and if you go after 10 you will probably have to queue but given the excellent service in the restaurant, we have never waited longer than 15 mins for a table. Its got a great atmosphere with great music and friendly staff. The quality of the food is always extremely high....we have been back so many times now that we have tried every option on the breakfast menu! Favourites have to be green pea fritters with poached eggs, the pancakes, the turkish breakfast and the big cooked breakfast! A must try when staying in Singapor
3
We went there for breakfast. Choice is good but they didn't let us order a side of French toast on top of our order because it "can't be made separately" (lol). We ordered a croissant on the side instead, but it was stale from the day before and they charge you 5$ for it ! Overall good food but prices are relatively high compared to other good brunch places in town
5
Modern cafe with cool interior right down to their choice of mugs, plates etc. We had a delicious breakfast here on a weekday morning. All of our food was cooked to perfection and with flair (such as the yummy slow roasted tomatoes) and accompanied by a wide choice of excellent coffee. We sat inside however there are some tables outside where we would happily sit next time. Nothing to fault
4
We tried Common Man recently and was pretty impressed. If you are into high quality coffee, it is for sure worth trying. I got the mocha, which I always get.. It was a tad bit on the sweet side, but nonetheless delicious. The interior here is amazing. We loved the atmosphere.
5
This place was amazing. It's expensive, but amazing. If you've visited Ann Arbor, Mi before, I would put it on par with Zingermans.This is the place to go for a true English style breakfast. For about $28 SGD you get eggs, bacon, sausage, Hashbrowns, chorizo fried beans, mushrooms, and tomatoes. The bacon is real bacon (not ham), the sausage is real sausage (not a hot dog), the Hashbrowns were fried in chorizo grease (yes!) and the eggs were actually fried eggs (not half boiled). Oh yeah, forgot about the whole grain toast.All of the ingredients are organic I believe. And the coffee is great too. They had too many blends for me to decide, so I opted to go with the house brew. If you want a true breakfast, the kind that grandma used to make that caused grandpas cholesterol to spike this is the place! Love it. We will be back
4
Went with family with small kids. Great burgers and the breakfasts were good too. Friendly staff and they don't lose their cool and great customer service even when the place is heaving!
4
This is the place which I can't stop recommending my friends and colleagues to go to for their coffee and the Common Man Full Breakfast. Besides inaccessibility of the location and the noise level in the premise, this wouldn't stop me from recommending and from considering heading back again. CMFB is the best tasting brunch meal that I had so far
4
We went for brunch one Sunday. The food was great - I had churros and my colleagues went for the big breakfast. There is always a bit queue outside. Not a place for a quiet brunch as it can be a bit noisy. Also a bit more expensive than other options even in the neighborhood.
5
tried the grilled chicken , the turkish breakfast, the muesli, the organic egg benedict and the wonderful coffee and juices.I highly recommend this place, staffs are friendly but during busy hour they have their hands really full so it's best to head there early to avoid the rush. awesome coffee i must say again
4
If you're fussy about your poached eggs...ie the whites are solid but the yolks are runny (of course!), you'll like the eggs here.Try the green pea fritters with poached eggs. One of our favourites, great coffee too.Just be careful if you end up on one of the stools, not that comfy
3
This place makes coffee seem like a precious ordeal, and when I asked for milk, the waiter looked at me like I was out of my mind and so unsophisticated for requesting it. Fine, whatever, I don't care. I need coffee to wake me up, not as a cultural statement on my sophistication.Yes, this place is expensive, but the quality is good. If you live in Asia (outside of Singapore), then good breakfast options are few and far between, so that's why I went here. I'm sure there are other & better breakfast options, but at 8am in the morning after a long flight, this did the job. They're pretty high & mighty on their coffee, and seemed disappointed I didn't know anything about what flavors, brews, or pressing styles were available. Again, pretentious
5
We've lived in Singapore for about 4 years and can count on one hand which are the best brunch spots; PS Cafe, Wild Honey, Cafe Melba, Spruce, Nosh. Thats pretty much it. Then these guys came in and basically made them all look bad. Excellent service, which is not easy. Food is consistent, interesting and flawless (and very tasty). It isn't like fancy breakfast and lunch in the micro-gastronomy pretentious sense. Its like the owners just had a think and said "lets do simple accessible food, but do it really, really well" Which they do. They roast their own coffee, which pretty much tells you all you need to know about the quality of their coffee - I've seen their beans popping up in a few places now. Its also a pretty slick shopfit/interior. It used to be a shabby office lobby. We've lived in the area for about 4 years and wondered if anything good would happen with the space. So my wife and I now live across the road from them - this makes us very happy :
5
I loved this cafe. I was drawn my the glowing coffee recommendations but was even more taken by the delicious food. I visited on two consecutive days - there's an endorsement - and really enjoyed both meals. The Australian touch was evident - but still lots of local influences as well. Terrific service, lovely atmosphere.
3
The ambience inside is decently comfortable, though the chairs could do with some cushioning. I didn't notice disabled friendly entrance, but maybe it's there. We sat at the bar, when the restaurant was not crowded and under the nose of the staff - yet it took them forever to fill water glasses, bring us the bill etc. On the wall behind the coffee bar there's a sign that says free coffee to the unemployed - when we asked if this was true - they said no and that it's written as a joke. We definitely didn't think it was funny. Something like this coins actually get you into trouble or atleast bad PR in other countries! (Note we are not unemployed and were not eyeing free coffee) Finally the cost. We paid 160 SGD for 2 mains (bread and eggs), coffee and 1 desert. No alcohol. I know it's Singapore and money flows like it's a Monopoly game, but still found this pricing absurd for a coffee shop brunch that call itself "Common Man". This isn't part of a star hotel or high end chef chain, you don't anticipate the bill stacking up when you get in!If you are on corporate/ finance industry dime then this place is appropriately priced for you possibly because you might have long forgotten what non-expensive but still great food is like. But if you still retain your ability to call out a fraud, then here is one.
5
Saw this on Honeycombers, so thought we'd give it a try!People talk about the wow factor , well this place has done it for me! WOW ...from the outside nothing special, looks could be deceiving and the que a bit daunting, be patient as the que moved very fast! Once inside the atmosphere was great (a bit noisy but fun) and the smell of coffee very warming. The service we had was fantastic, fast and friendly. To the food....wow wow wow best breakfast I've had in Singapore, the menu was perfect, in fact was hard to make the final choice. The ingredients fresh and with so much flavour. We took our kids and they gave it two thumbs up to the french toast.....Well done, we are coming back next weekend too! Wish I could buy the pottery plates from you, love them
5
This place never disappoints. Truly artisanal coffee made with impeccable attention to detail. Creative, delicious food using surprising combinations of ingredients. Efficient service, even when very crowded.
Try to Turkish breakfast, Green pea fritters with eggs, and the French Toast!
5
Excellent service, excellent food choices and by far one of the best coffee's I've had in Singers!
Their Vegetarian breakfast is tasty.
5
This is a great place to have a fun time with friends or a date. Workers are very friendly and proffesional. Drinks are also very good. This is one of my favorite place in town for drinks after dinner.
1
When coffee is your main thing, be great at it ... not truly awful !!
The most bitter undrinkable coffee I've had anywhere.
Hey, the food was great, & the ambience good, but if you want coffee, find somewhere else.
4
Varied and interesting menu, tasty food and great coffee. Quite pricey, especially the coffee and juices.
3
Place is very popular, quick service and meals, very noisy. Cosy inside and outside, probably best with friends and certainly not on romantic dates. Service is aimed at getting you in quick and getting you out quick. Friendly, but the intent is too noticable.Great variety in food for both meatlovers and vegetarians, coffee menu is confusing. We ordered the ox cheeks poached eggs, Turkish breakfast and veggie option with halloumi. All were excellent and nigh on flawless. I really can't say much else about it. Ingredients were of high quality and taste/textures perfectly on point. Props to the chefs.CMC seems to be mostly popular for its coffee (we ordered Flat White's). The skill of the barista is excellent, but he/she unfortunately has awful coffee to work with. Sour and with a strong reminiscent hint of liquorice. I only managed a few sips, can't imagine what an espresso must taste like. We asked for a 3rd Flat White with one shot of coffee instead of two. Not great, but drinkable when sugar was added. The waiter commented that the coffee is "fruity" because it's freshly roasted. CMC is not the only place roasting fresh coffee in Sing, but with great ease the worst western style coffee I've tried while living here. I have absolutely no idea why anyone would like drinking this.Come here for the food, it's fantastic. Don't come here for the coffee, it's downright nasty
4
Three of us met here, for breakfast and to sample their coffee.We sampled the eggs, full breakfast and pancakes and, of course, their cappuccino and espresso macchiato.All of it was delicious, nice runny eggs, fluufy pancakes, decent sauce and served swiftly and with good cheer. The coffee was excellent and came with decent latte art. Good to see professional barista work in Singapore.The atmosphere was good as well. Lots of families, all appearing to be having a good time.We'll definitely return for more
4
Wonderful ambience, friendly staff overall great vibes! Even if you don't want to spend 7-8 dollars on a coffee, go for the free cupping (coffee tasting) to absorb the vibe and move a teeny weeny bit closer to being a coffee connoisseur ;) The cupping session I went was good fun, almost every one attending was just a coffee enthusiast. What they take you through are simple things like testing the fragrance/ aroma, basic coffee processing methods etc.. not too detailed/technical at all.An afternoon well spent for a coffee lover :
4
I ordered the Full Veggie Breakfast with scrambled eggs (eggs are done to your choosing). The various components of the breakfast - the mushrooms, the spinach and the halloumi were SO flavourful and well done. There was an excellent slice of sourdough toast to go with it and the eggs were soft and fluffy. Easily the best breakfast I've had in Singapore! My friend had the Croque Monsieur - she loved it as well. It is pricey for a breakfast, but I find it worth a Sunday brunch treat
2
Been here twice and both times I was not too impressed by the food. Coffee was certainly great, but both times all the sets we ordered were too salty and too oily. Tender pork burger, for example, was too salty; common man breakfast was perhaps better; the middle-eastern set was nothing to write home about. More importantly, they are overpriced. When I pay $24 for a burger in Singapore I really expect it to be super super good, which was not. But of course, if you want to people-watch you can come here to do that, because there were definitely a lot of people (though we don't understand why). Had to queue for seats, and when seated it was not comfortable, seats too high and space to cramp, you would certainly have to share with other customers. Otherwise, the 'cool/hippie' vibe is there so that's great - I would perhaps just come by for a coffee if my friends insist.
3
No atmosphere, very expensive food that's "presented" but lacking depth. Coffee is fine - same as 40 hands, but the shop and location of 40 hands has more character. S$20 + for eggs is probably pushing it.
4
The coffee here really is better than most places will ever serve. And the food is not bad either. The all day breakfasts hit the spot, even if $24++ for eggs is steep. Still, this is Singapore.
4
Close to the best brunch in Singapore. A great and diverse menu that my wife and I are still working through. The vegetarian breakfast is superb and it's a rarity in Singapore to see vegetarians so well catered to. Baked beans with chorizo confit and poached eggs and rocket on sourdough is also a favourite. Coffee is great. And service is professional and prompt. Only downside is the layout - with perhaps too much bar space and therefore limited tables. A very welcome addition to the Singapore cafe and coffee scene - sets the bar high for others to follow
2
Verdict: expensive unremarkable coffee, stuck-up service. I know my coffee and the prices were at odds with what they delivered. expectations were high. The regular House mix/blend was lacklustre. The Cafe Machiato overly acidic. Waited expectantly for the "Back room" coffee. I was told it needs to "brew" . Still waiting for it, twenty minutes later. Shudder to think what it will taste like. Didn't try the food but the place is certainly popular with tge beautiful people of Singaporewell heeled Singaporeans and Expat crowd ( who would be very unlikely to pay the same prices back Home!). My Costa -Rican coffee has arrived - i'm obviously not an aficionado. Costly 10 dollar Â£5 coffee. Food may be the real draw here.
4
One of the 50 dishes to have before you die, the Turkish bread with birds nest egg was just delightful . A totally surprising twist on breakfast, and lived up to its billing.Washed down with Common Man coffee, my day was complete long before my meetings finishe
4
Great place for brunch to soak up the excesses of the previous night. We sat outside as inside was full, but this was pleasant enough as fortunately it was a clear morning in Singapore. This is comfort food at its best, and generous helpings of it too - eggs Benedict comes with two perfectly soft cooked peeled boiled eggs sitting on top of beef cheeks on toasted sourdough bread with a well made hollandaise sauce combining everything together nicely - yum! Then there was the Turkish breakfast, a combination of soft egg with cucumber, tomatoes, olives, deep fried feta balls, a dash of slightly sweet hummus and flatbread. Washed down with some extra strong coffee and refreshingly bitter fresh orange and grapefruit juice, good value at less than SGD80
4
Ok, the Turkish breakfast is INSANELY AWESOME. It's not like any breakfast you'll have ever had. It's a bit kooky. There's a soft boiled, deep fried egg that just oozes yellow when you cut into it... there's AMAZING hummus, along with two deep fried balls of feta, shreds of filo pastry, olives, tomatoes, rocket and flatbread. It is breathtakingly good (if you like this sort of food). Definitely not healthy, so save it for a day you're up for indulging, and the portion can feed two. Everything else I've tried there has been excellent in terms of quality, and pairings of flavours. The menu offers salads, a burger, other types of more traditional breakfasts. (To be honest, I don't pay that much attention to it because I know what I want). Oh ya, the french toast is DIVINE. The coffee is also great - strong and thick. It does take A LONG time to be served though. Not sure why. Generally though, the service is good. The staff are smiley and friendly, and pretty prompt. The restaurant itself is nice, but not super comfortable to sit in for a long time. Mostly because there are a lot of stools and I'm not a fan of backless seats while dining. I've generally gone on a weekday for either breakfast or lunch and have found a table easily. I'm told on weekends is cray trying to get a table. So apart from the slightly uncomfortable seating situation, the long wait for coffee and the prices being on the high side, this place is TOTALLY WORTH VISITING
4
It's not the locals' usual breakfast or coffee joint. If you are expecting cheap and usual western coffee style cafe or bistro, you will be disappointed. You will not find the familiar coffee menu ala espresso, cuppacino, mocha, flat white etc here. Those who don't count these as real coffee appreciation, be tempted, give this place a try. Those unsure, just do go with an open mind and prepared with fat wallet. As a fan of poaches eggs, I have tried many eggs benedict in Sgp and this one won my vote. All rounder winner in sight, texture, taste - true heavenly experience. And added bonus, these are organic free range eggs. <3If there's one thing I could suggest to improve, it will be the music. It was too loud and doesn't do anything to provide a leisurely breakfast dining experience. It makes the place feels common bistro and inconsistent with the prices.
4
Came by to check out the coffee after my friends were raving about it! We ordered a maachiato and iced cappuccino - both were very nicely done. Strong taste yet not overwhelming or bitter! Will come back and try the food!Music thou can be softer - quite noisy in the cafe
