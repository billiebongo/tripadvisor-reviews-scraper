Came here for a coffee after lunch. It's a bit out of the way but the coffee was really quite good, so worth the effort required in getting here. Interesting Royal Enfield motorbike at the front of the shop.

Great spot for breakfast with excellent coffee. Just a shame we couldn't return to try their craft beer. Hope to return on our next visit.

Lovely hospitality. Great coffee (actually really great coffee). The place has a nice simple vibe and never gets too crowded. They even have a liquor license and serve Achipelago brews and some nice Aussie wines.

What impressed me was the attention the barista pay to their customers. Sharon and Raj take the pain to explain their drink menu and actually customize their brew to match the client's preference. Their cakes are to die for. The cafe is cosy and quaintly decorated and a perfect place to hang out. They serve also special daily menu

For a new cafe on the block, it is still in the process of filling up on the soft furnishing, but it's the coffee that captured me. These guys are so serious about their craft that they flew to Australia for proper Barista training. From that course, this young couple learnt the finer points of making a great cup of coffee.I had a great cup of cappuccino while chilling out at this cosy little cafe. The coffee was rich and aromatic, nicely balanced with the warm frothy milk. None of the "coffee-flavored-milk" concoction I tend to be served elsewhere. The carrot cake I ordered was moist and wholesome, not overly sweet and totally hit the spot. Next time, I'll come at mealtime to have a go at their food menu.Cappuccino ~ $4Carrot cake ~ $4.50Satisfaction ~ Priceles
