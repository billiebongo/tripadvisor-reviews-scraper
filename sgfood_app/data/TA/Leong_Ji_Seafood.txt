Decent food, a little oily and over priced. Their signature dish - cuttlefish with fried Kankong was good.

Must try the Fried Vege with cuttlefish. Yummylicious!
However be patience and ready to wait during dinner time.

Have gone there a few time already. Food was good, inexpensive. May need to wait a long time esp during the evening peak.

We frequent this restaurant very often as we reside in Punggol. Food here is always fantastic and prices are very reasonable! The white bee hoon and Rojak kang kung (with cuttle fish) are must-order items in all our visits. Chili crab and steamed fish are always good and fresh. Make sure to call in for reservation if you are going in big group and for weekend dinner

Headed here after our walk to Coney Island, friend recommend this place cos price was reasonable. Tried their own version of white Beehoon, though have not tried the best, theirs was good, have the wok Hei. Seafood was fresh. Beancurd with mushroom and salted egg yolk sauce was flavorful and yummy. Mixed veg, simple and nice. Fried chicken with lotus roots was excellent.

We headed to the Punggol outlet after a run at Punggol Promenade. This restaurant can be quite affordable as they do not have service charge and GST. We ordered Garlic Kailan, Omelette with onion and Sliced fish with ginger. Not bad, I would comment. Would come back again due to its affordability.

We (group of 7 with kids) turned up punctually for a dinner reservation made with the Punggol outlet on a Sunday evening. It was a full house. They told us that our reserved table was occupied by a group (whom they were then serving) who made no reservation. The waiting staff in charge was not making any effort in managing the traffic control but instead asked that we place order first and wait. We waited for almost 15 mins and the staff simply ignored us when we check the status. We eventually left for another restaurant few steps away, just before getting hungry and angry
