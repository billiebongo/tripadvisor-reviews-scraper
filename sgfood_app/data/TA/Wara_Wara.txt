The food is absolutely amazing and delicious. I went there with friends three times for lunch since last month. In my opinion, so far it was one of the best Korean restaurant in Singapore especially Korean barbecue. Hope everyone will love it!

My wife and I stumbled across Wara Wara whist exploring Chinatown on our second day in Singapore. Initially we saw the menu and were pleased with what the place had to offer, but unfortunately had troubles ordering as the sole waitress couldn't speak more than 2 words of English! That's our problem though, not hers, we shouldn't have been so linguistically ignorant!! I'll be frank and say we have no idea what we ate, but it was delicious, and the at table stir fry service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend it if you've not tried Korean food and want to give something different a go!

Went to Wara Wara for lunch with 4 others today... Short version... One of the best Korean restaurants in town... with chef's/owner's personal attention, even our vegetarian guest was adequately satiated. He will be back very soon on his non-veg day to savor the BBQ that he could only whiff at today. Too much to write about the feast we had.. Go try yourself... Kimchi were made by Chef in the kitchen, unlike the PRC imports many restaurants serve. We bought a BIG tub to go!!!Other side dishes were just as good.MUST TRY..even though parking is scarce during this period leading to CNY
