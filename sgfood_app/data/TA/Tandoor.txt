The food was great. There was lot of variety in the buffet. Both the options in the vegetarian food and non vegetarian food were good.
5
We ordered the set dinner and it was wonderful! Everything freshly cooked in the tandoor open kitchen. Even my kids loved it! We will be back!
4
Authentic Indian food and the naan is light and fluffy. Butter chicken is just nice - not too rich or watery - and sauce is delicious with naan
4
Went there for a business dinner with colleagues. Very nice ambience, attentive and responsive staff and very good food. We had vegetarian food only, it was great. Would recommend this as a top Indian restaurant in Singapore

We attended the Sunday buffet without a reservation. The venue wasn't busy at all.This is a very good restaurant. Very nice ambience.The service staff were very friendly, attentive & offered suggestions on what to try (if you weren't sure & asked). Their knowledge of the food was very good too.There was a very good variety of dishes available from meat, fish & chicken to vegetarian. The buffet caters to most tastes & the curries aren't too hot. They also serve dishes from the tandoori oven.There were several different rice dishes & you could order different types of dosas & naans as well.There was also a good array of desserts that you could try.All the food was fresh & flavoursome. We really enjoyed the meal in a relaxed atmosphere. Needless to say, none of us could even think of dinner that evening.I would definitely return on my next trip to Singapore & plan to be there on a Sunday!Great non-intrusive service & good food. The cost is not cheap but is commensurate with the experience
1
While the food (Gourmet 5-course) was generally enjoyable and up to standard, my friend and I were shocked to find the overall bill to be twice what we expected. We found out what we had been served had been the equivalent of two 5-courses. Even though we had asked the waiter while ordering if the 5-course was "enough for two people" and he had indicated it was, the waiter recorded our order as two portions. Whether it is incompetency on the part of the waiter or otherwise, my friend and I left the restaurant in a sour mood since we ended up forking out way more than we expected
4
If not for some vouchers I probably would not have found out about this place. Lucky I did. Top notch Indian food! Had a Naan basket and the different flavours were all good. The palek paneer was a stand out. I could not finish it but we packed the left overs and gobbled it all up the next day. It was that good. Highly recommended
3
I didn't find anything exceptional in this resto except maybe that its a little bit pricey. Food served on time, accommodating in our requests since we have kids with us.
5
Have been coming here since past 2 years during my trip to singapore. The quality of food has been maintained and is just excellent. The menu is limited but it has the best dishes. Authentic indian food and the staff is too good
5
Excellent service and food with wide variety with many options even for vegetarians! Desserts were also very delicious. Most pleasant Indian food brunch
5
If you are looking for Indian food this place is among the best! They serve best of Vegetarian and non vegetarian food.
5
Great Indian Food,Traditional north and South Indian Food. Price Range, okMy Singaporean Friends say, the best one in town. But there is another one around the corner. I love all of them
5
We had a family event here with 20+ people and enjoyed the Indian dishes served very much. Very authentic, great spice, very fine presentation and delicious taste. A highlight in SG ....

We went here over twenty years ago, when it was one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore. How times have changed! The food is still pretty good - the crab masala is delicious, other dishes less unique but above average. However, although there were only 3 occupied tables when we were there, the (extremely polite) service staff were remarkably absent. The dÃ©cor is dated, and the restaurant is located in a dreary basement of a fairly depressing hotel. At the high price they charge, one would be spoiled for choice in Singapore (Rang Mahal, Song of India, Punjab Grill, Yantra, etc).
3
This restaurant is in the basement of Holiday Inn Hotel, which has plentiful car park spaces normally. It has always been known for good food, and the chef did not disappoint during our visit today. The service was good, and toilet very clean. We ordered many dishes, and they were almost all good. The chicken tikka was tender and fragrant, so was the cod, and kebab. The butter chicken was good. Somehow we felt the palak paneer and Keema was not to our taste.
5
***Recommended***-TandooriChicken-Away from my country, did not expect much, the hospitality at this place was very good. We had variety of tandoor based appetizer. All of them excellent. The Chicken Biryani was a sheer disappointment
5
Tandoor is one of the very famous Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Location is very convenient. Restaurant environment is lively. Really manus of Tandoor are specially like everyone 
4
We were surprised at how high the prices were at Tandoor but we really enjoyed the food (butter chicken, saffron rice and naan)
5
Dinning at Tandoor is always a lovely experience. The food, the service and the ambience is awesome.
4
As this was my first visit to the restaurant since its renovation some 3 years ago , I find the ambience nice and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful particularly with regard to the number and appropriate type of dishes to order to complement naan . The food turned out to be well balanced authentic and satisfying
5
Always love to dine at Tandoor. Food is fabulous and the ambience is amazing. Service was good . Location is in the heart of the city.
5
Its very tasty food and excelkent service by staff which delighted to come again and sgsin for dining
4
Food was excellent. We prefer veg and menu has nice range of veg food options. if restaurant can have some activity for toddlers that will be great. Something like coloring etc.
5
Love the food, exquisite fine dining North Indian cuisine. Level of spicy chilly adjusted to my non-chilly taste buds. Use eatigo app to get discounts
3
We had been here for a team dinner. The staff somehow was not welcoming and gave a condescending impression initially. But later they were quite helpful in suggesting what to order. The food was quite delicious but the delivery was very delayed. It was delayed even for the drinks
4
Good choice of food to whet our appetite. Curry just nice for my family, not too spicy. Tandoori chicken is our favourite
4
I usually make it to tandoor once a month these days if not more and they have consistently been good when it comes to north Indian food. My last visit was just this week with my parents who were in town for a short while. We ordered palak paneer, yellow dal, paneer starter, rice and different breads. Every single thing was done well. High light of the evening though was gulkand ras malai! Highly recommended, if you are craving an authentic Indian fare...
3
Had lunch together with the family. Cannot fault the service. Waiters were attentive and the head manger provided excellent service. Was dissapointed with the Biryani though. Was basically cooked rice covered in curry sauce. Not what you would expect for a restaurant claiming traditional cooking techniques. Other dishes ordered were excellent.
3
Pro: Good ambience, The Naan was excellent, so was the Mango curryCon: The Mango Lassi was extremely sweet and the Spinach dish was saltyService: Col
5
We had no idea what is good at Tandoor, and honestly slightly afraid of trying authentic indian cuisine. But since Tandoor is so highly rated, there must be something excellent about them.The decor was opulent and modernly designed. When we arrived, there are only 3 tables filled with guests. We did not engage the assistance of servers, instead we browse through instagram and tripadvisor to understand what is popular among guests who had dine here.We decided on tender lamb shanks served in mild curry, fresh spinach, accompanied by some butter naan and basmati rice.We did not anticipate that the spinach was so peppery hot, we spent most of our time trying to put out the heat in our tongue. However, the spinach was tasty and fantastic despite being pepperish. Our actions probably caught the attention of the chefs, and they sent a server over to see how we are doing. He understand that the spinach was too much for our taste buds and insisted on changing it to Mango curry, compliment from Tandoor. We were so caught by surprise with the kind gesture, despite repeatedly declining the offer.In conclusion, we would prefer the spinach to the mango curry, only because of personal preferences as mango is not our most favourite fruit. The butter naan was buttery, the lamb shanks were so tender and succulent, it wasn't at all dry.
5
Having lunch at Tandoor is always a very pleasant visit outside home. The food is delicious, light, the staff very polite and service oriented.
5
I arranged a party for my Daughter's Birthday and indeed happy to share the feedback that the service and food was Excellent.
Special Thanks to Satyendra, Nitin and Ravindra for thier Support.
5
Great Indian food with excellent and consistent service. The Sunday buffet brunch is one the best Indian buffet selection.
5
We had Sunday brunch many times here. The food quality, taste, temperature and variety is just excellent.
5
Good tasty Indian food that left our tummies feeling the right amount of full. Surprised that the bill was well within the budget for what we experienced.
5
Food in Tandoor is always good, especially the butter chicken, paneer and the fish!
the service was quite slow during this visit, but very warm and accomodating nonetheless
5
One of the restaurant where you can have a peaceful lunch or dinner with family peacefully in a nice ambience. Great vegetarian food options. Mangalore mango curry is an all time favourite and a speciality at this place. One should try all chef specials and desserts! Great service and they have maintained the quality over the years..
5
We had dinner at Tandoor with a large party of friends for a birthday, and the service and food were delicious, authentic and classy.The buffet and portions were very resonable, but the star of the show was the Fish Tandoori - amazingly succulent and delicate.One of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. Highly recommended. Expect a price point commensurate with the high quality of the restaurant
3
It is a mixed feeling - like some......if you are looking for best food, you could get disappointed
5
We've been to Tandoor for Sunday brunch twice and love it. The fresh naan and dosas are fantastic. A large selection of meat and vegetarian curries plus briyani to enjoy. Free flow mango lassi as well and ice cream which was a hit with the kids. We highly recommend as this is one of the best in Singapor
4
This restaurant in the basement of Holiday Inn was good but very expensive.The service could have been better.
5
I have been here several times. The food is consistently good and authentic. Service is also usually good. Its very good value compare to most other similar restaurants
5
Rajiv who served us was attentive and helpful. Food was really really good. They gave extra servings of dessert and complimentary tea.
5
A Perfect dinner with lots of varieties. I will definitely recommend this to everyone. This was our second visit.
4
Food very tasty and delicious. Service excellent. Enjoyed a quite family lunch. Tandoori items well made.
5
The experience was amazing and so was the food! Our waiter Boon Leong was great, paid attention to detail and so hospitable
5
Superb ambience. Nice Food ( I ordered makai kaju seekh , paneer makhani labanbdar and Rasmalai) Friendly staff Cons :- May be it is more noisy around weekends. I am going to try it on a weekday too.
4
Been here a few time. Excellent service staff and ambience. Good food but could do with a wider vegetarian variety
5
Very nice ambiance restaurant. Tried twice food standard is very high. They serve papadum before meal, the chutney is very addictive. All the staff there was very friendly and nice despite I'm on discount promotion. Highly recommend if you are looking for good indian food.There is also open kitchen to see how was your food was done.Would visit again.
5
I always stick to Indian food even when travelling abroadI loved this restaurant The food was goodThe staff was helpfulAmbience was okI also tried other Indian restaurants in Singapore: all were less expensive but the food served here had No comparison We spent nearly $ 110 for two curries, raita and 3 breads. I ll definitely visit here agai
5
This is one of our favourite Indian restaurant. The food is excellent and refined; service is always good.
5
Very friendly and prompt service. Great food and wide selection! centralised location. will visit again.
5
Visited this restaurant on 18th may 2017,had dinner here .its excellent one!had dal makhani steam rice makhmali paneer roti rose cardamom prnacotta.
5
Great ambience, excellent food and extremely friendly staff. Overall an amazing experience. Highly recommended.
4
Lunch was excellent and service great! Rice and naan were expensive sides but overall it was an amazing meal
5
We took the set menu for lunch, which at 50% discount with Eatigo was amazing value. The food was superb and left us filled for the rest of the day. Service was very attentive as the restaurant is apparently not busy on weekdays
3
Dear Tandoor,The ambience was really perfect and price offer was decent either.All 12 if us ordered the set dinner menu. The soup was not even to a minimum standard.The main course was quite cold a big portion but dishes were not right.two chanks meat items n even curry was chicken n lamb..too much meat item in one main course.The saffron rice was the best.The nann and desserts are acceptable.apologise for unable to appreciate much..this was our experience on that day
5
We were staying at chancellor @ orchard and asked for an indian restaurant to have our dinner. They recommended Tandoor which was just 2/3 minutes walking. It was a weekend and we went without a reservation. As we were all senior citizens they went out of the way to organise an additional table which took a little time. The quality of food was superb and ws value for money
3
Environment and seating and people good but food taste not up to mark.Not going there for food.Paneer tikka was totally bland, tandoori bharwan aloo no taste.Only samosa a bit ok not too good.Dal makhani was the only good  Pudina paratha and naan no salt no taste
4
We dined here on our way home from England. The service and the food are still excellent. We had the Lamb Chop, Lamb Chicken and Mango Curries steamed rice and Naan Bread. The curries were very nice and the Mango Curry is especially good. The ambience is great and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We always try and have a meal here when we are in Singapore and the service and food doesn't vary it is always of a very high standard. Will be back next time we are in Singapore
5
Warm atmosphere for a good catch up with authentic north Indian cuisine. Service was excellent and waiters are attentive to our needs
5
Great ambience and very courteous and receptive staff!! Good food of course. Value for money. Will visit again
5
Tandoor takes care to carefully prepare each dish with its unique Flavours - not like the run of the mill restaurants
5
We are vegan, so it is hard to find food that does not contain animal products. We were happy to see that Tandoor had several dishes that could accommodate us. The food was great, and the staff outstanding.
4
The naans were not fluffy like the first time we were there. Some parts were thick and floury in the middle. Out of good will, they didn't charge us for them. The mango curry was too sweet for our taste bud. It might be ok for some other people. I'll definitely good back and try the naan again. The curry and the naans were really good the first time.
1
Very Expensuve and pushy waiters who want you accept and pay for very expensive bottle of wine not requested by the custome
5
The food was excellent, presentation was good. Deserts were very good and Nitin prepared a dessert platter for each of us so we could try out 3 of the desserts
5
Everything was exceptional, starting with the samosa starter, soup, lamb chop, rotis.A hall-mark of a good restaurant is when their papad's are crispy and hot, which means they cared to prepare it fresh for you.Every course was served with a gap of 5-10 mins, a good gap to re-work your appetite! I do not have a sweet tooth, but the hot halwa and mango malai ice cream was irresistible. My review looks like a paid one, but thats how good the food was. This was an official trip, taking wife soon
4
Food was great, as always, though servings seem to have become smaller...but service is tip top as expected
3
I returned to tandoor because I missed the authentic regal flavours of the Indian cuisine they serve. However I left gravely disappointed and won't return again. One, they revamped the interior to a modern style that lacks any character, food now served in white porcelain which is sterile and above all, food was not all that good at all. Ordered their signature fish curry which I used to enjoy but now it tastes like a cheap dish out of an Indian eatery.
5
Wonderful ambience, great food n good service. Excellent all round and would recommend his place anytime. A1 all the way.
5
food's always great and the staff has always been very courteous and warm. I've always had a satisfying experience here
4
Super Indian food, great service ! Only desserts need to be improved ! All in all a great experience 
5
It was our last day for our workshop and we had lunch at authentic Indian cuisine. The rice came from India. Even with just water to pair of the spicy food it was amazing for our team to bond. Never had Tandoori long grain rice so well
3
Paid $30 for chicken briyani. It was tasty but the portion was simply too small. Would be better if theres more for the money we paid.
3
The food order was average. The wine was served in glasses. The taste of wine was different at every serve. It was reported to the serving staff too
5
Food was excellent and service superb! Great ambience and decor. Worth the money spent. Would definitely go back to Tandoor with family and friends
4
The mango Curry was something out of the box. Wonderful the combination with the mustard seeds and curry leaves
4
Food was delicious. Wide choice of food. Curry dishes just suit my taste as it want too spicy.Excellent location with ample parking, though a bit expensive (have to admit). Also service could have been bette
1
Family loved it Nice place , good hospitality, great food , reasonably priced .. a friend recommended to me and I would do the same .
4
We had gone for a family dinner at Tandoor .... had a wonderful time , enjoyed the food. Service was excellent
5
Food was appetizing and did excite all my taste buds..We had a great valentine's dinner and the service was quick and commendable.Great place with nice decor:)
5
Incredible Indian food, the best, with delicious combinations of flavors ! Very good service. Not expensive. The dinner set must be proved
5
We went in a big group of 10 and the food was awesome! Their tandori chicken, palek paneer, naans are very good. This may sound crazy but i love their rice too, its very fragrant! the service there is very good too! So its highly recommended
4
Food at the restaurant was excellent. Richly flavoured, and yet no single spice overpowers. Subtle and sublime. The tandoori dishes were the star - lamb, chicken, paneer.Service was on the impersonal side. Staff did what they needed to but nothing more.It is on the pricey side. Ask for the set menu if you prefer to have variety. Otherwise, I noticed the staff usually only distributes the ala-carte menu (for dinner)Nothing to shout about in terms of ambience. It was cool, clean and quiet, perhaps to some, slightly dull
4
I stayed at the Holiday Inn on a recent work trip and joined a group of colleagues one evening for a meal here; it was a local colleague who chose this restaurant on the basis that it served superb Indian food - he was right!We enjoyed a succession of shared dishes, each beautifully flavoured. What stood out for me most especially was the tandoori fish (supposedly cod, but I still don't believe so as the texture is so unlike cod we have in Europe). I also loved the okra side dish and the tandoori chicken and mutton. Compliments all round to the kitchen staff!My mango lassi drinks complemented the food beautifully too
4
Had decided to dine here. When online and try to book online with a special request that my dinning date is celebrating her birthday! No reply! Decided to book via Chope with request! Food no doubt is good but lack the touch! Service needed to work on! Can see the team struggling and look really tire
5
Excellent Indian food. Ordered Indian vegetarian food. Better than most of the restaurant in India. Taste was great so was the staff
4
It was a group outing. 10 people. Birthday dinner. Reservation made a week prior via an app. Closer to the date we called them to tell them about the occasion. They kindly said they would provide a brownie as a birthday offering. They also said the app could only do max 8 people, and suggested we make a second booking for the last 2. We did. Day before, called to reconfirm. Staff's phone manners were a little rough around the edges. But he found one reservation. Couldn't find the second. They fixed that situation, but was told they didnt do anything for birthdays because there was no bakery on site. But they would provide a slice of cake anyway. Lovely. Day of: the restaurant was beyond what we expected. Didnt know it had been around for 30 years. It was honestly, a wonderful escape from the main Orchard Road strip where the restaurants would be full of loud Singaporeans who wouldn't care less they were bothering other diners. The interior was gorgeous. In muted tones, everything felt regal.Service was amazing and attentive. They knew their menu well and could recommend dishes to complement each other. The dishes that arrived however were not instagrammable. They each looked the same as the other. But they tasted good. They didnt go hard on the seasoning which was great. Not salty.When it came to desserts, we informed the staff that it was the right time to do the birthday perk. They said they didnt know of this. Shock. Horror. BUT: they immediately rectified the situation and were generous to bring out cardamom ice cream for everyone, with a candle for the birthday guest. Really lovely gesture.Payment was an issue. They didnt have any record of the reservations we made through the app, which would affect the final bill. A little awkward since we had to scramble to find the reservation codes in front of the birthday guest. I voiced out that this was the second time they couldn't find our records. The staff apologized though, so what can ya do?Overall though, I would come back. There are few posh restaurants in Singapore that can be considered heritage eateries. So that in itself makes this place special. Also the majority of guests were Indians which would give you a good idea of how good the place is food wise. And they were all so polite, spoke in hushed tones and basically contributed to a very gentile atmosphere. Service, ambience and value are difficult combos to get right in this country. So this place is a gem
5
This restaurant is located inside Holiday Inn hotel - off Orchard Road. Serves authentic Indian dishes. There Tandoori Chicken and Mutton Biriyani is awesome. Bit on the pricey side
5
Excellent location, especially if you are staying at the Holiday Inn Orchard Road City Centre hotel. The staff were polite and helpful, sorting out which dishes were suitable for someone who wanted gluten-free food and which were not. Good choice of options; peaceful atmosphere!
4
Good ambience and good food supported with good service. Located centrally and easily accessible restaurant
5
If you're looking for best Indian food in orchard road, don't think twice. Not oily, but very well cooked food
5
Worth a visit definitely. Food served was of good quality. Nice and quiet ambience on a weekday. We tried the tandoori chicken and chicken mango curry. Was really nice. The butter chicken and garlic naan were great too! Recommended!
5
We had a delightful experience of experiencing classy Indian Food. The tandoor platter along with the 2 chicken dishes went along beautifully with the house pour red wine. Must visit place in Singapore for experiencing genuine Indian culinary flavors.
5
we have eaten many times in this restaurant , it is always good and feeling home as well. our lovely meal at this restaurant prawn curry with naan and pulao rice. always happy. good to recommendation to others.
5
Had an unconventional Lunar New Year eve dinner of North Indian food, with my friend, Fong. No traffic jams, no ERP charges, no parking problems - check. No problems getting a table, lovely quiet and peaceful ambience, no clatter of cutlery or crockery or stressed out wait staff or noisy chatter - check. And the clincher? Our own creative auspicious take on the choice of dishes: papadam with mango chutney and mint chutney, 遍地黄金、甜甜蜜蜜、青春永驻；corn and cashew kebabs, 金银满屋；fish tikka 年年有余；mango curry 满地黄金；chicken biryani 鸡年吉祥 with yogurt raita and all washed down with a fragrant cup of spiced masala chai 招财进
5
Have been to Tandoor since the birth of my son 25 years ago and till now... nothing have change. Food is as original and services are as excellent as how we first visited.
3
Our third visit to this restaurant and this time overall experience was less than last time. The service was damn slow and every time asked, we were told high demand. The food was good but we really couldn't enjoy given long wait times. The waiter kind of pushed to order all at once
2
Based on the positive reviews we went to enjoy sunday buffet. The seating area is nicely done. The table layout was great. Lassi was nice too. As others have said before dal makhani tastes great and naan was alright. The soup I had was starchy and tasted like packet soup.The chaat was not made nicely and lacked the chatpata taste. Paneer tikka was hard and almost cold.The vegetarian kababs tasted alright but were also cold.The other vegetables we unremarkable.The rasmalai had a horrible synthetic smell.I won't be going back
5
They had best of Indian food lasse was really good they had lobster with special sauce all really good
4
Lovely ambience, great spread, eager service and pretty authentic & deliciousl taste for most dishes (chaat, rasmalai, salian, chole, veg kababs)
The palak paneer, naan-paratha, bhature, paneer tikka & masala chai needs improvement... they taste pretty bland & the foods bit chewy
5
Must compliment the chef for amazing Indian food. Tandoori chicken, Daal makhani were simply brilliant. Even the vegetarian fare was super, succulent pieces of tandoori paneer, jeera aloo - overall, very satisfying experience, even though an expensive affair !!
5
Excellent North Indian cuisine and ambience. Our favourite North Indian buffet in Singapore. Sunday buffet is really a delicious spread with wide variety. Highly recommended!!

We were transiting from New Zealand and made a special stopover in Singapore, just to visit the Tandoor restaurant. Arriving by evening flight and after a quick rest we went to the Tandoor. What will the ambiance do if the food and the service are not good?  The ambiance is pretty normal nothing great but the quality of the food and the service was pathetic.We were served by Ravinder, who was more interested in rushing us off with a totally indifferent attitude and uninterested service. We had to ask him if he wanted us to stay and have our dinner or he was more interested in us leaving, repeatedly asking us for our mains order when we had just ordered some drinks and entrees.There was a Kebab Festival on in the restaurant and he never bothered to provide us the festival menu or advise us that the Kebab festival was on. We had to ask for the festival menu, which was provided very reluctantly and then we ordered some kebabs from the menu. The quality of the food was very basic full of artificial colour; the Non Veg Sampler was not good at all. The Naan breads are the costliest in south East Asia and not worth the price. The butter naan was under cooked. The 2nd drink ordered took ages to be delivered and after reminding the staff that a drink had been ordered, which I suppose they had forgotten. The Tandoor team do not live up to their Moto: A New Name. A New Look. A new Identity. But the same familiar smiles.There were no smiles to greet us. For a restaurant of Tan doorâ€™s stature and the very experienced chefs they have it was a really disappointing visit.For the Mangers reference our Check no. Was 11689
4
We enjoyed our dinner at Tandoor. Both the appetizers and main course were delicious. Paneer labadar was melting in our mouths. Even dal tadka was above expectations. Desserts, however, were small in portions and average. The service was average too. Our waiter got us all the food together (staters and main course). Thus, we were pressured to finish our meal quickly or else the main course course would go cold. The bill for 3 people without drinksb was 130sgd.
3
Can't fault the food but definitely can do better. Chicken biriyani was not anything like dum biriyani I expected. Rasmalai (desert) was good but find the portion a bit small. Will go again as there are many other dishes yet to try and the service/environment is excellent. For Holiday Inn lodger, you can get 10% discount.
3
Went here for sunday brunch which is priced at 49++,we were a group of 7 adults and 3 kids..The seating area is comfortable and the staff is helpful and welcoming.Food was tasty(not finger licking or exceptionally yummy) which includes the live counter for dosa and chutney..some chaats which had only samosa and papdi chaat..I think can include pani poori as well.The vege kababs were cold and the paneer tikka was cold and very hard to chew.They had chola bature which everybody liked.The breads were served at the table (garlic naan/butter naan/tandoori roti).They had good non veg options also ,but being a veggie I hardly remember the name.The desserts corner was nicely placed which had three ice creams flavour,gulab jamun,sevaiyan kheer and some indians sweets like barfi etc.The drink included orange juice and mango lassi.Can include a lime based drink as everybody cant have sweet drinks.Overall experience was ok..as compared to the price
4
Went there for lunch. Food was ok. Had butter chicken, veg korma and mutton. Flavours were average. However service and ambiance was good.
5
While staying upstairs in the Holiday Inn on a brief business trip to Singapore, my colleague and I decided to try the Tandoor. We were looking for good food in a relaxed atmosphere but our expectations of the place were not particularly high. How wrong were were. The staff were welcoming but not over the top. They were informative but not pushy. And, the service was nicely paced so that we could relax but were not left wondering when we would be attended to next.The food was excellent. The wine list is OK if overpriced.Being located in the bottom of the Holiday Inn, guests turn up at the Tandoor in everything from extreme casual to "wedding formal". But whatever the style, the staff seemed to treat every with the same gentle welcome.If you like good Indian food, this is certainly a place to find it
5
20 of us went to Tandoor for a team dinner. The service was excellent. I personally liked dal makhani and tomato shorba.
4
Very good food. Ambiance very well done. we ordered for vegeterian food which was the best best we had in Singapore thus far.
4
I love the food here they serve authentic Indian curries straight off the pan . Hot and delicious. It is a must visit for me whenever I am in Singapore
4
Arrived back at the Holiday Inn after a long day of walking and shopping with kids reluctant to step out too far away from the hotel for dinner. So we decided to check out the Tandoor restaurant on the LG floor of the hotel. We found a very nicely decked out restaurant, with a good choice of drinks including very accommodating staff who were very helpful with our allergy related dietary constraints. We ordered a Kaali Dahl, Mango "curry" and Bhindi with naan and rice. The Bhindi Masala was pretty average however the dishes were delicious and had been made with love
4
Seven of us had lunch at Tandoor. The food was excellent though the wine was marked up several times. We tried the chicken khatta pyaz, mutton masoori and the mango curry. I had never had mango curry before and was pleasantly surprised. The service was pretty good
5
Had the pleasure to dine at Tandoor last weekend for our family dinner and it was indeed a very pleasant experience. The food was great, must order the Fish Tikka, first time I have ate such soft grilled fish, totally overwhelmed. The service was superb, the staff patiently explained the dish and how they were cooked, also tell us about the various deals that we can explore, and even gave a complimentary birthday cake. Special thumbs up to Ravindar!Will definitely go again to try the weekend buffet
5
Nice ambience, good layout and table is not close to another.Attentive serving staff especially Kavinder is very patience explaining the menu to us.We have 10 of us and enjoy the meal a lot.Tikka fish and the keema is my personal favourite.A little pricey but worth the trip
1
This place was our go-to Indian restaurant as it was near our previous office. Both the food and service were great.I went back two weekends ago and brought my friends from out of town as they wanted good Indian food. Everything was doing well and I was enjoying my butter chicken until a small cockroach crawled onto my plate.I called the attention of a manager (he was wearing a suit versus a shirt like the other servers) --- and he just swiped away the cockroach -- I had to signal to please remove the plate. So he removed the plate of food then replaced with a new plate, spoon and forks. He apologized but I was surprised that it didn't seem to be a very big deal for them. One server asked me if I didn't like the food because my plate was clean and when I said that I was eating and a cockroach crawled onto my plate, he laughed. I was so shocked with the reaction.They didn't even offer to move us to another table nor to replace the food that was already on the table. We all basically lost our appetite. They gave a 20% discount but if a cockroach can crawl onto a plate by the main dining area, I can't imagine what's crawling inside the kitchen hidden from all the guests

We (I,my wife and 6 year old son) went to celebrate my wife b'day; ordered 2 different set dinners - "Dinner Gourmet Trail" costing $58 and $48 respectively.Ambience - was decent. We felt like we have come to the right place.Staff - was very friendly and attentive. I would rate it as one of thier positives.Food:Chat - "Water Chestnut & Corn" and "Samosa & Corn". It was horrible; I mean literally very bad. We wern't able to eat it after 2-3 bites.Soup - It was decent, not very filling unlike some restaurants where it is loaded with cream.Kebab - In first set, the kebabs ("Paneer Mattar ka Tikka", "Makkai Kaju Ki Seekh" and "Bharwan Tandoori Khumb") were very good. Mattar filling in soft Paneer slices were a perfect combination. "Makkai Kaju Ki Seekh" was also pefectly cooked and tasted excellent.However the kebabs in the second set were disappointing (Achari Paneer Tikka and Aloo ki Nazzakat). Paneer was hard and in the other one, there was a distinct smell which wasn't nice.Main Course:Dal Makhni - Excellent. Nicely cooked, tasted great. We finished the whole dish.Makhmali Paneer Lababdar - This dish was not served at all surprisinglyLahsooni Palak Bhurji - Average. However It just doesn't go with Nan/Rice.Paneer Kalimirch - Average. It could have been better. More is expected in one of the fine dining resturants.Nan - bad. It was very thick at some points. We had to selectively eat.Pulao - Average.Desserts - TRIPLE SENSATION DESSERT (Saffron Pistachio Kulfi, Rose Cardamom Panna Cotta and Gajar Ka Halwa ) - I must say all were very good and exceeded our expectations..Service - Though the staff was very friendly, they took lot of time in between serving the various courses. They forgot to serve one dish in the main course. When I reminded them the manager was very apologetic and gave us 20% discount. The gesture was nice and appreciated but at the end of the day we expect service to be better. That's why we go to fine dining restaurants.I would have given another shot at this restaurant as some of the food was excellent. However given the cost, I would rather try some other

Tandoor is a very decent and comfortable restaurant with perfect ambience. Food quality is very good, and they are consistent in their food preparation. Staff hospitality is nice, and it was pleasant experience for me. I was staying in Holiday Inn, and had dinner many times. Sometimes was too late as well but I had service as expected. It is little expensive but not too expensive, as you may think, being part of Holiday Inn. They already have good choice for veg and non.veg food, but if they include some more choices. I saw children parties, get together of project teams, family guys enjoying, etc. and so on. In a nutshell a place you can count on

Great food, service and ambience. Good overall experiance. Chef was kind enough to prepare a special dish on our request which was not on menue.
5
The foods were amazing. It's fresh and very tasty. I will definitely recommend this to all my friends to try.
4
Courteous staff, lip-smacking food with real quick service amidst a serene ambience is what is Tandoor all about :-)
5
This is an excellent restaurant. We called them just one hour before they close but they were very receptive to take the reservation. The food is magnificent and the bread is awesome. You must go.
4
Warm Welcome, nice decor/ ambiance, nice food served withi minimum waiting time, good service. Bit expensive compared to restaurants of similar standard in Singapore.
5
brilliant food. excellent decor, caring service, upscale, yet inviting, we had many meals here. the buffet spread is huge, but no so worth it. the ala carte is bette
5
We choose to stay in Holiday Inn Orachard City centre , just beacuse of Indian food and Tandoor restra.lived upto the expecatations. Food was yummy . Service was good
5
Excellent Ambiance & great service... Neat and tasty food...A perfect place to enjoy Indian food in Singapore.
3
Landed here as all the other restaurants were packed on a Saturday evening. Food was Ok but the service was good
5
This place has nailed it . Great food. Great ambience. Good location on orchard. Caring and silent attentive service. Fresh food. Buffet is not worth it unless you are a big meat eater. Restrooms near restaurant could be maintained bette
5
Visited Tandoor yesterday with family. The food & ambience are good and also the staffs politeness is amazing. Highly recommendable for nice Indian food.
5
This restaurant has Awesome food and service - would love to come again!
The quality of food is fresh and chef takes care on each dish that's served

Everything about this restaurant is grand and 'gleaming' except the food unfortunately! It was a strange experience. The staff were very well presented and well spoken. The high end furnishings and ambience. The place settings, the table cloths, the accessories, the cutlery and high end china crockery. All very plush. I was quite intrigued whether the food would be consistent with this image! Alas, it was not! I ordered a few dishes; meat, vegetable, prawn, rice and bread to get a good range across the menu. And they brought me complimentary popadoms and chutneys. But it was all very microwave bland. I've always been disappointed by the 'high end' curry house! It's sort of a contradiction in terms. To 'posh' up what is essentially street food is risky. You can't just posh up the surroundings and then serve exactly the same standard of food - or less - as you would get in a cafe in Little India. To be fair the Rang Mahal in the Pan Pacific (the other 'posh' Indian) doesn't succeed either. Exactly the same problem. I've only ever been to two that spectacularly pull it off - The Red Fort and Tamarind in London - for taking a high end approach to the food first (and then the surroundings). These guys use top young chefs that bring some innovative, new and exciting approaches to Indian cooking and apply to Lobster and other high end ingredients. The Bombay Brasserie pulled it off also but the edge was taken off the food by the exorbitant setting! Unfortunately, you cannot charge 'high end' prices for all the things around the edge and not put the same (more!) focus on the dishes! The reason we come in the first place! So, if you're thinking of going to Tandoor I would recommend you to save your money, go to Lagna Barefoot or somewhere else in Little India, and rejoice in what Indian food should be!

Quality of food was very good and tasty. We were very impressed by the attentiveness of the staff and they do good recommendation when consulted. Nice ambience too
4
I have enjoyed good service and hospitality. Food cold be more warm but Nan were excellent. Nice ambiance
5
We had the best Indian food at this restaurant. Although the dining is expensive but still worth the experience
5
Brought my friend for her birthday dinner at this restaurant and had a lovely time, the ambience was quiet and nice, the service was good.They even explain the dish while serving and also pop by now and than to check if everything is ok.Friendly staff great experience!
5
We enjoyed the 5 course degustation meal & I have to say it was the best Indian we have ever eaten. The flavours were amazing & the food prepared so they weren't too spice for the kids.
5
Really liked this place...I stayed in the same hotel where the restaurant is located and I do not normally have dinner in the hotel, but in this case if you like Indian Food, give them a chance cause it was really well done and in a beautiful place!Excellent service, congrats
3
Visited with husband and 2 kids, after a busy morning sightseeing, felt like staff were trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible and hovering for our order, which was just annoying. Food was tasty, the fish tikka was delicious. Was very expensive though, $12 for a bottle of still water is just ridiculous
5
Authentic Indian Food. Excellent service. Great place to have a satisfying Indian meal. Very good location just off Orchard Road.
5
The food and its quality is delicious, the ambience is very good, the staff service & mannerisms are excellent
3
Food are above average, service is good. Recommended to come and try.
One of the better Indian food restaurant around...
5
Booked the maharaja suite for a party. All went well. The food was great and staff on standby when required
3
We were guest at the Holiday Inn and found it convenient to eat here based on good reviews on TA.The portions for the main course were really big, we had no chance to finish more than half. The chicken bryani was tasty, but nothing exceptional. A nan bread was 10 dollars, which I found a bit overpriced to say mildly…I had Kulfi with saffron and pistachio for dessert, and frankly it was not that good…We left the restaurant stuffed, and with half of the meal left. The staff was friendly and service minded. The restaurant was modern without the typical decor that you often find in Indian restaurants
5
The service staff gave a wonderful small birthday cake for free when they knew it was my husband's birthday.The restaurant smelled heavenly it has a sort of classy aroma.Best Lamb my husband had. He had the lamb kebab. He thinks it is the best lamb he had.I enjoyed all the food. The spinach is amazing, the saffron rice is wonderful. The soup is great.Service is outstanding.Would come again.Excellent place for celebrating birthdays
5
Overall was a good experience.Place: Was in Holiday Inn Hotel, and easy to find. They offered complimentary parking too (must ask though)Food: Quality was amazing. They had items that weren't commonly found on North Indian restaurants' menu. Wait for the food was kind of long (or may be it seemed long as we were really hungry), good thing papads were given while waiting for our food.Drinks: Wide range of drinks fro alcoholic and non-alcoholic option. Was there for Dad's birthday, hence were opted for the non-alcoholic beverage ; pPricing: They prices charged were normal for hotel rates. We made reservations via eatigo however, hence had a 50% off our food orders. That's awesome!People: So called one of the service staff, as we needed to order more naan as we wanted to finish off the curries and sabzi we ordered, he acknowledged but was serving other tables instead of ours. Waited for almost 20 mins before we were attended to. But still a 5-star review as the place was pretty crowded, so as diners, we just had to be patient
5
The food was awesome. we loved it even the in-room menu had a few selections from the restaurant which were great to
3
We cannot get authentic Indian food abroad. Very rarely do we get that WOW feeling while testing food outside India, even if it is Indian Restaurant. This one was no exception. Food was OK. Not great. Prices were decent. The only item on the menu that we tried and which was excellent was Rasam. However I was told this is one of the better Indian Restaurants in Singapore. So when you are craving for Indian food in Singapore... this is the place for yo
5
The dining experience was a happy one because of the attentive and friendly service by the 2 staff who served us. Food was good too although pricey. Prices could be friendlier on the pocket.
5
I visit Tandoor once every 2 months with my family. I have always gone for dinners but have also been for buffet lunch. I had buffet lunch on May 29. The food quality was excellent during the dinner, when I ordered from ala-carte menu. The dishes didn't taste the same during the buffet. One thing that doesn't change is the 'excellent service' of the staff. One person I would single out is Nitin. He has been outstanding with a permanent smile on his face. He goes the extra mile to exceed the customer's expectations.
5
While our vacation to Singapore we decided to go for Indian Award Winning restaurant Tandoor, Holiday Inn , being in our hotel gave it an edge above , perfect Indian food with well balanced spices n mouth watering curries .We tried Paneer Lababdar first night & Channa Masala next night both were very well made to perfection , Lachcha Parantha & Pudina Parantha were properly buttered n crisp !! To end our meal we indulged in Pistachio Saffron Kulfi and were served with extra good portion !Definitely recommend when visiting Singapore !! Staff is really welcoming n warm atmosphere makes Tandoor at Holiday Inn Orchard Road a perfect Indian Fine Dinning Experience !!!
1
The waiter who goes by the name of sharma actually served us used mint chutney and even lifted a fork which fell on the floor and kept it back on our table ! Haven't seen this kind of poor and filthy service anywhere . We highlighted it to the senior staff there but they did nothing . Will never ever visit them again . Poor quality food and and even worse kind of service 
5
We stayed at the hotel for a week and had dinner at the restaurant almost each night....My kids loved the feeling of having "home food" away from home..
4
Overall we enjoyed the food and service at Tandoor. Some of the menu items are good and worth a try. The staff is courteous and attended us well. On our day, we had a bit noisy Neighbours at near by table.
5
We were invited by a Friend & this was our very first visit to TANDOOR - the food, the service & the ambience were so good that now, TANDOOR has become our 'always to visit & dine' restaurant. Incidentally, we had a very good server who gave us lot more information about the Sunday brunch etc. We are already getting prepared for our next TANDOOR eatinv out
5
This was our first visit and we are completely surprised by the hospitality of the staffs specially Mr Sharma who was a new tranee. This was definetly an unforgettable experience for us..
5
One of the best northern Indian restaurant in Singapore. I was introduced to this restaurant by a business Associate. He is vegetarian and I m not. The restaurant serves both vegetarian n non vegetarian food. All of which are prepared with perfection!!
5
Scrumptious mango curry and good customer service.Ambience was really good.The taste was different and good
5
After a long day spent sightseeing, my wife and I decided to have dinner at this venue which is in our Hotel. Tandoor was recommended to us when we booked the Hotel and we were not disappointed.Not being particularly hungry, we opted not to have curries but to choose and share starters. We went for the "Malmall Seekh Kebab" and the "Roti Pe Boti" which are chunks of tender lamb. The head waiter Boon Leung suggested we take double portions as these are starters - succulent and just the right quantity.Tandoor has an extensive menu with vegetarian and non vegetarian options and several other tables were taken this evening including some patrons who are residents of the city.Service was exceptional and special mention needs to be made here of Boon Leung. He insisted on providing us with complimentary desserts - a scoop each of their home made Kulfi. Being an IHG member, I was entitled to a gratis glass of wine and chose their House Chardonay. Boon Leung gave me a second glass on the house .....
5
The food and the plating are equally good. We went there for lunch. At first, we thought our portion was small, but in the end, we were struggling to finish it. The service was good. We even were offered a dining club so that we could dine there with a discount in future. The restaurant is situated inside the hotel so it is nicely decorated,
4
Of the many fine dining restaurants in Singapore, Tandoor, in our experience, is amongst the top 3 (the other two being Raffles Tiffin Room and Shangri-La), and has maintained that standard of excellence over years! Simple dishes like Daal Makhani, or Bhindi are cooked to perfection, fingerliciously good... Being vegetarian, we also tried the Mango Chutney this time, which turned out to be surprisingly good... The ras malai was good, not great, but still a nice round off to the dinner..
4
Authentic Indian food often difficult to find outside India. Great service, nice ambience, a bit expensive though
4
Sunday buffet with family. Value for money and fairly good selection. Above all fantastic service from staf
5
I've been here twice. Once for dinner and once for their weekend lunch buffet. The restaurant is located in the lower level of the holiday inn near orchard. Dinner is definitely a more classy affair. The restaurant was packed for a weeknight. Their food is to die for! And the service is impeccable. We ordered a bunch of starters and shared 2 main courses among the 3 of us and we had food left over.There wasnt as much of a crowd during the lunch buffet. They have a good spread of food, but if you are vegetarian, there are not as many options as there are for non-vegetarians. I really liked their starters. Main course items and dessert were good. If I were to go back, I would go during dinner or order a la carte. I didnt think the buffet was worth the money I spent. However, if you are looking for a classyplace to celebrate something over Indian food, this is the place to go
3
We were eight friends who went to Tandoor to celebrate anniversary of one of our friends. The ambiance is good. The starters were really tasty. Lamb was succulent. Chicken lemon had distinct taste of kafir leaves and lemon grass making it taste unique. It raised our expectations. But the main course was simply below average. The prawn, the chicken, the paneer, all tasted same in the tomato gravy! Mutton was still manageable to eat. Biryani was more of pulau and that too with gravy base. The dessert was cake and it was okay. Considering the price, my rating of three is just on the basis of starters. Else, main course could not have managed to get more than two.
5
Tandoor in Singapore was our life line . It serves fresh , excellent food . We all being vegetarians were were too happy to have our dinner there . Dal makhni is too delicious . Gobhi gajar , dum aloo too were yummy . It's the best place to have vegetarian food once in Singapore
5
We had a dinner at the Tandoor restaurant with my daughter. We loved everything about it. The menü is small, but it has the best of the most popular Indian dishes. We selected chicken makhani and mutton briyani. They were both very delicious. My daughter enjoyed the mango lassi specially preperad for her. Their drink selections, especially the wine list is also very good. Don't forget to try their freshly baked warm bread too. The service was great, the staff was very friendly. Our order came on time. If you are looking for a fine dining and like Indian food, definetely Tandoor is the best place for you.
5
A must visit if you're in Singapore.. Best Indian food.. and the service by staff is excellent! Loved it.. everyone should give it a try if you looking for Indian taste
4
Very nice ambiance... Reasonable pricing.. Friendly staff. There can be more veg items on the menu card, I felt, as I m veg. Overall good restaurant
5
We celebrated a birthday, and the staff are really friendly. The food was great too, will surely visit again!
5
A long weekend in Holiday Inn City Centre and an excellent buffet lunch at the Tandoor restaurant of the hotel.
Excellent and delicious food.
5
I was pleasantly surprised by this Gem!! Everybody needs to try it. Incredible food and ambience and the the service team are exceptional.
5
Tandoor is one of these retauranys where you can go months after months and never be disappointed by the quality and the service!
5
Great food, ambiance and fast service.
Accessible directly from Holiday Inn at Somerset.
Loved the food - Biriyani was really good.
5
Food was very nice and great on taste.I can say authentic India food. The price of some items was high but it is ok compared to the quality and kind of food being served.
2
Looks like the food served were prepared for that day. Remaining from previous days served after heating.
5
I like the resturant , decoration , staff and the food was extreamly tasteyI visited the resturant twice during my short stay in Singapor
4
Good Authentic Indian taste. Very friendly staff. a little slow service though but nice place to dine to endorse the taste bud with original Indian taste
4
Easily located. Good ambience for biz. Expensive. Amex palette with discount. Been there twice and food is consistently good. Crab curry, mutton, grilled lobster are my fav. But I couldnt appreciate the deserts
5
Good food and ambience, nice service.
Would recommend to anyone who likes Indian food. One of the best places in singapore
5
My fifth time dining at this beautiful restaurant. Great food, the best Indian cuisine in Singapore. Service is par excellence. Love the ambiance and the whole experience. Looking forward to patronize again soon!
4
After a long flight, this was a great spot to recharge and enjoy a relaxing and delicious Indian meal. Their service was also excellent.
4
I loved the mixed kulcha, baigan ka bharta and dal makhani. By far the best Indian I have had till date. Highly recommend the restaurant.
5
Excellent food, I have enjoyed the dinner with my family. One of the best Indian restaurant in SINGAPORE
5
Had their one-for-one lunch thali. Excellent presentation and service. Non-veg dishes better than veg ones though. Great vlaue
Highly recommended.
5
We organized a friends 40th surprise party here and booked the hall adjacent to tandoor, called the Maharajah suite for our group of 30 guests. Throughout we were in touch with Mr. Kalyan, who gave us a good deal for the buffet. On the day itself, Mr. Nitin, assisted us thru the evening and everything went smoothly. Right from making the room dark and surprising our friend, to the projecting of videos, cake cutting etc, Staff was hospitable, helpful and courteous. All guests appreciated the food and desserts. We will surely be having more parties at this venue
5
While staying in Holiday Inn, we had dinners in Tandoor several times and was never disappointed. It is one of the best Indian meals in the town, (some dishes might be a bit expensive though). Excellent food, excellent service and a good value for money, Highly recommended to try.. Huzay
4
Crab masala must try dish. Garlic naan was good but no flavour of garlic.Got a complimentary pista kulfi...yummy But bit expensive
5
We visited Tandoor for our anniversary and we had a fantastic time. The food is delicious and the classy interiors surely add to the wonderful dining experience. The service too was up to the mark - prompt but polite.We ordered the veg dining set (5 course meal) which includes an array of dishes that are served at your table one after the other at perfect temperature and impeccable presentation. The portions are perfect in size and should be more than enough even if you are starving. We enjoyed all the dishes but loved the chaat, soup, rice and dessert the most. Thank you Tandoor for a lovely anniversary dinner! We highly recommend this restaurant for fine dining if you want to try first class Indian cuisine
4
Well this place was our ideal dinner hangout. the food here is excellent and so is the service. specially the dal makhani. one of the best i have had outside of India. a Must visit
4
Keep up the good name of India in Singapore for this wonderful restaurant serving sumptuous food and Indian delights...
5
My wife and I went to Tandoor for our marriage anniversary and we were amazed by the quality of food and service.
4
This is more of a formal restaurant. The menu is not huge but there are a few items that you would not normally see at other restaurants. We tried the crab curry (excellent) and Bailey's kulfi. There were a few more interesting items. Overall food and service was good.
4
We had gone to celebrate wedding anniversary of our daughter. Since part of the family is vegetarian we chose this restaurent whose buffet caters to both .Locationof this place is right in city.There was variety of food with soup starters main course with a variety of curries and ambience was cosy. There was a variety of desserts too to chose from. We were looking for papadums but unfotunately it was not there. Frankly there was so much variety that i had to miss tasting some because it was above my capacity. Regarding the price i think it is definitely above medium range and i can afford it for special occasions only.Staff were frienly and quick in service
3
I visited twice in 7 days stay at Singapore.Dal makhni as always was awesome.But I had problem with Paneer vegetables on my both the visit.They were courteous enough to offer me an alternative vegetable and also gave us complimentary desert.Pro: Dal Makhani,Courteous and hindi speaking staff.cons : other vegetables are not up to their standard. They resisted to give me 20 pct discount on food offer by Singapore airlines.Only after enough persuasion ,they agreed and took my original boarding pass as the proof which I found ridiculousFinally It was an average experience ,which could have been an awesome one
5
Located in the basement of Holiday Inn, this restaurant is on the more expensive side for the Indian food in Singapore. But the quality of food and service makes the trip worthwhile. Try the bread basket if you are in a group larger than 3 - they give you 4 different types of naan of your choice. Mango curry, which was a novelty for me, was tangy and sweet.
5
Tandoor's food is delicious. The Tandoori Chicken is flavorful, and the Mango Curry is to die for. The various flat breads are also good, but if you get rice it is easier to enjoy the sauces and curries. The service staff is very attentive and helpful. It's a nice place to bring a family, especially if the children are a bit older. The decor is formal yet comfortable, and you are not rushed out when you've finished eating. Highly recommended
5
One of the Best tandoori restaurants in Singapore .. Delicious food .. Wide variety .. Excellent service and great ambience ..
4
The food was tasty and full of nice aromas and light on the stomach.Service was nice and staff was very polite
5
One of the Best vegetarian option and very good quality food plus service and all the restaurant staff members are very friendly and polite. Our favourite restaurant in Singapore. Excellent.
5
Tandoor is hidden in the basement of the Holiday Inn. The hotel itself is hidden as it is 2 blocks off Orchard road. The decor is very nice and service is good - however my friend is a regular so that probably influenced this part. They serve good north indian food. I would definitely go there agai
5
We as family from Dubai were on a short visit to Singapore. We stayed in Holiday Inn. We had an opportunity to have our lunch at Tandoor. My family really relished the food. Well prepared and presented. The staffs showed utmost hospitality. suggestions- You can play a very soft music on the background.
5
It's been surprisingly challenging to find decent Mughlai/North Indian cuisine in Singapore. Tandoor definitely fits the bill. Service is great too, and value is terrific with the discount on American Express
4
Very nice service staff, friendly and efficient. The food was nice but we found the curries too salty. The tandoori chicken was very good and it was moist
5
Visited there for lunch and tried the kind of fix menu with fish chicken and vegetarian... The best was tomato basil Soup and fish tikka.. Rest food was also good.. Ambience was very decent. I check with server the about the fish they use cod fish.. Must try dish.. Defiantly recommended restaurant to India. Food lovers.. Cheers.
5
We had a very enjoyable evening in a lovely setting. The food was excellent and there was a wide variety of food to suit everyone which was all tasty
5
As always, the service and standards at this Restaurant are excellent well loacted. Staff are courteous and always helpful. r. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable. I always try at this restaurantl when in Singapore and have no complaints whatsoever. From check-in to check-out, I am completely satisfied. Convenient to Orchad road. 
5
Enjoyed my meal with my friends at tandoor . The food was delicious and meat were cooked very well. Very pretty place and set up in the restaurant . Will be back for more definitely. I would like to thank 2 crew members that were especially attentive to my friends and I, a male Leong and another lady. there were issues with my reservation but it was settled very swiftly and also we were well served with great hospitality . Will introduce this place to my friends :) 
5
The last time we visited must be some 20 years ago. The food is still excellent - the lamb curry, tandoori chicken and the Angoli. Attentive service and beautiful ambience. Will definitely visit again
5
The buffet was definitely value for money and a great experience.
Would recommend to friends.
The ala carte is slightly on the expensive side though , but for sure fine dining
4
Food was great. Service not too bad. The atmosphere was cosy and nice. Will sure be back for autentic Indian Food!
4
Went there with family and was not disappointed..Had good food wide selections to choose from so veg or non-veg not a problem at all
A thumbs up from my side
5
Liked all Veg food in this place, good service, chef was able to make very spicy food based on the instruction, very spacious restaurant
5
Enjoyed my lunch experience very much with my friends, thank you Mr Boon Leong for your attentive service ,the food was delicious and really good location too. accessible & great place for a meal.
5
I would like to commend Boon Leong who looked after my family and very close friends from Australia (whom I invited to dinner) and made our evening very special.
3
We had the Sunday brunch couple of weeks back. While the buffet had a lot of options, they were not necessarily well replenished and staff had to be reminded. Service wise also there was a gap in terms of handling a full house. Quality of food was not top-end (though pricing is). It was in line with Indian food at restaurants which are not as expensive. Not much of a differentiator
4
We stayed at the hotel and came to Tandoor for dinner. The restaurant is in the basement and too hidden if you ask me but the food was so good! they have different types of Naan and a good variety of food. Service was top notch! Would go there again if I could
5
Located in the basement of Holiday Inn, this isn't the easier place to get to without a car, taxi or uber.This is a spacious restaurant which exudes fine dining. It was not crowded on a Tuesday night which made the dining experience more pleasant. The wait staff were few but attentive. I worry on a busier night if they would keep up. The service was great as our party of 2 were served personally.Our order was simple. We started with the Paneer Muttar Tikka which was excellent. For entrée we got dum-all and their signature paneer dish. Both great on flavor. The garlic Naan were the only disappointment as the were over buttered and felt flat.Price wise was fair for the experience at SD100 for 2 without drinks
5
Hidden in the basement of an old, non-descript hotel on the seedy side of Orchard Road is the Tandoor Restaurant, serving North Indian cuisine. The décor is elegant, the table linen is crisp and showplates classy, in contrast to the rest of the hotel public spaces. The food is excellent, and adequate in servings. Service is attentive but unobstrusive, and staff are courteous and knowledgeable. Boon Leong, the supervisor, went out of his way to help us understand the menu and assisted us in ordering sufficiently and not wastefully. It was a beautiful evening with friends, all enjoying succulent morsels of exquisite Indian food
5
Great ambience; Excellent choice of vegetarian food and delicious deserts; Outstanding and personalized service
4
After hearing a lot of praise about Tandoor, we tried this restaurant and even though the food was good (dal was excellent and other items were just good) and service satisfactory, I really would go to other options in the same price bracket.
4
We were in a group so we took buffet lunch and dinner in the restaurant 3-4 of times and we came out satisfied every time! The food is a bit expensive but any decent Indian restaurant in Singapore is expensive by Indian standards. An average of 15-20$ per person is the norm per meal. The Ala cart menu is still more expensive
5
This is the third time we have dined here and the service and food are still the same. The Mango Curry is a highlight of the menu and that is the one dish that I come here for. The other food is of excellent standard and the staff are very helpful. We had the staff of the Holiday Inn recommend two of the dishes that we had and have to say that their choices were very good. Would just go to Singapore to have the Mango Curry at this Restaurant
4
It was a revisit to this excellent Indian restaurant since a previous meal over then years ago. It has good ambiance in the basement of Holiday Inn. The waiters are courteous and attentive, and handled the four bottles of wines that we brought with change of glasses. The quality of the very soft and fresh paneer, and naan served is noteworthy. Tandoor chicken was well done and moist. Good experienc

For years I've heard this was an amazing Indian restaurant. Earlier this week I attended a dinner function there that was held in a private room. We were three tables of eight and the menu was preselected, and I'm sure that affected the experience. At best this was an average experience and average Indian food. I've eaten a lot of Indian food in Singapore and you can get some great food Indian there. Perhaps you can here as well, but not with the menu we had.Our appetizer was nice, lamb with chicken tandoor and a fish tandoor style as well. The main was quite average- 4 dishes, Tika Marsela which was OK, A Cauliflower dish that was disappointing, a Chick Pea dish that was also disappointing and a fish in a sauce I didn't recognize that was pretty good.Desert was pistachio ice cream and it's was enjoyable.Service was good but the kitchen was spotty in getting everything out together. If my choice, I wouldn't repeat a function there

This is a restaurant with the friendliest service and truly delicious food.It is let down by being in the basement of an Holiday Inn where a crowd of seminar guests were crowding the hallway and staring at diners through the uncurtained glass front.The crab masala was exceptional,the rice perfectly cooked and chicken tikka beautifully aromatic and succulent.This is the very best of Indian cooking which deserves a better home

Being from the United States, where good Indian restaurants are a rarity, we were pretty much blown away by all the Indian food in our travels throughout Southeast Asia. Tandoor proved to be the exception. Some of that is our own fault, which I'll get into later in the review. Taking it from the start, this restaurant, which is located in the plaza attached to the Holiday Inn - Singapore, is very attractively decorated and exceedingly clean. You really get a fine dining impression here that you don't get at most other Indian restaurants. In that regard, alone, it is likely the only Indian restaurant in Singapore you can host a formal dinner at without worrying about what impression the venue is conferring upon your guests. Moving along, my wife and I were, unfortunately, not aware that the restaurant closed to prepare for dinner service at 2:30 in the afternoon, and we showed up just shy of a quarter after. That said, we were seated, and not made aware of the looming deadline, otherwise we would have been happy to leave and come back for dinner instead (our hotel was fairly close to the restaurant). Five minutes after being seated (without a menu to look over), the no-nonsense manager showed up and, realizing we didn't have menus, he quickly handed us two and told us we needed to order now because the kitchen was closing. I didn't appreciate being rushed, and should have probably listened to my instinct and left to return for the dinner service instead of sticking around, but we proceeded to our own detriment. I'd read accolades about their mutton, so we quickly ordered a mutton curry dish (I cannot recall which one, since we selected it on the spot) and their murgh makhani, as well as naan to accompany both dishes. The food was served to us inside of 15-minutes, and was fairly disappointing. The mutton was cooked hastily, and the curry was more or less tasteless. The butter chicken was okay, but didn't particularly stand out. The naan were good, but, when we asked the server if we could have another one we had the opportunity to hear a series of vehement protests erupting from the kitchen when he went back and asked one of the chefs. Hearing the chef berate us second-hand because we dared to ask for more naan really supplemented the fresh white tablecloth experience of this 5-star restaurant very well. Finally, the server and manager came back with boiled rice instead, which was better than nothing. At the end the bill came out to S$110. Don't get me wrong, my wife and I enjoy cooking food from a wide variety of cultures, and I fully acknowledge that Indian food, in the spectrum of attention required for proper preparation, is very taxing to make (even when you aren't rushing it out in 12-minutes), and I can fully understand an Indian restaurant like Tandoor, acting in a manner befitting such a fancy restaurant, charging that much for lunch. What I do have a problem with is being charged that rate, and being rushed and not served properly prepared food because we inadvertently came in proximity of the restaurant's closing time

We went to Tandoor for dinner on my birthday, opted for set menu of 58++ of both Veg and Non-Veg. I would say that menu items are well paired. Appetizers were good with tandoori Chicken, fish and prawns. Veg has Paneer option also below average though. Chicken soup was a let down, tasted like canned one. Main course was really good with Dal Makhani as star. Chicken Kalimirch (Pepper) was tasty, meat being tender and fresh. Veg option was some paneer item also very nice. Bread choice was Jaitooni Naan Oliver Naan) which was yummy. Saffron rice was also well cooked to perfection.Finally for dessert, it was a combination of 3, Carrot cake, kulfi and some other dish, pairing was excellent. Meal was good enough both in quality and quantity. Service was prompt.We asked for a candle in dessert which was missed somehow due to miscommunication between waiters. When we asked again they provided a birthday cake promptly. Nice..they do care about their customers.Ambience was very good, perfect for dinner date

An Indian restaurant with good ambiance tucked away in the basement of Holiday Inn, Tandoor is a place for those who would like an exclusive experience. The waiters are courteous and attentive. The average food resulted in my 4 star rating. The vegetables in sabz-e-bahar seemed raw and undercooked, in contrast to well balanced dal makhni. The quality of the very soft and fresh paneer served is noteworthy. All in all a good evening.

I visited this restaurant in May with family expecting that it is a very standard restaurant. As per their website their price for buffet t lunch is 48++. At least 3-4 items were missed in real compared to the ones mentioned in their website. Food quality is extremely bad. Biryani looked to be prepared early in the morning, not fully cooked. Other than their chat counter, I did not find any item tasty. Their buffet lunch is not better than any buffet restaurant for 15-20$. I strongly recommend not to visit this restaurant
5
Very warm, friendly and helpful staff. Deserve to be commended. Authentic Indian tandoori food. Impeccable service. Good interiors.
5
Service, food and ambience - all very good. I am sure the holiday inn would have many guests from india staying here because of tandoor. Better reserve in advance as the place can get pretty full on a busy day. The service and setting is all high level, not for the pocket conscious guys!!The food is outstanding as expected, just as would be in a fine dine atmosphere in India. Must visit for finger licking gooood Indian food in Singapore!

Had a dinner at Tandoor, Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre. Should try the butter naan with special chicken curry. Tasted good. The restaurant manager was very friendly. We were served with a free special curry dish too
4
The food was good - haven't had Indian food with such finesse before, though it did feel strange to be eating Indian food this way
4
If Indian Food is what you are looking for... Fine dinning...this is the place to go to... In comparison to the other similar restaurants like Yantra, Raas.... I found the food quality, the service, friendliness of staff a notch higher than the others in the same category. My first visit to the place... The booking for the restaurant was done by a Singaporean colleague (John Ng : thanks for bringing me here)We were a group of 7, this was a business dinner with some folks with food restrictions (vegetarians). Hotel staff who took our order was willing to help and be sensitive to the no of veg vs. non veg...suggest quantity and was willing to accommodate to avoid over ordering. Food quality.... Lip smacking.... Palak Paneer, Bharta, dals ( yellow and black) fish tikka, chicken with almond gravy.... Superb food.Well done Tandoor.... Keep up the good work

This is one of the better Indian food places in Singapore, belonging to the ilk of Yantra, Saha Signature, Rang Mahal & Pujab Grill.Their Sunday Brucnh Buffet is fantastic with great variety and great Indian taste. a unique touch which I really appreciated was a non-Indian at the Chaat counter..fantastic!Very good variety of starters (kebabs- veg and non-veg), main course dishes (Chicken, Muttaon, Fish & Prawns), Daal, Biryani, Rice, Indian breads assortment, and live Chaat & Dosa counters..Just that we found the ambience a bit dark. Conceded that it is a fine dining place that are many times set in dim lights, we found this place to be wearing a bit of oldish look, and not so bright, probably also because this is in the basement of Holiday Inn.That still doesn't take away anything from the quality of food and service!Strongly recommended for a family dine-out
5
Lovely Ambiance!! Afternoon or Night!! Total Indian Ambiance well done!Courteous service great service by staff Bobby..Thank you!The food is non oily and a great taste as well as presentation was to the mark..Their Buffet spread is Great! chaat counter, Dosa Counter and the huge spread of veg as well as non veg is Awesome!! Great Great Desserts,Ice Creams and to end with the Masala Tea :))Justttttt in Love with the Place and Food
5
I had the best Indian meal I ever had in this restaurant.I especially like the fish cooked in banana leaf and the spinach dish.It was also good value for money
4
We got a voucher for the Sunday buffet and we landed at Tandoor. The spread was exhaustive - right from juice and soup to a fresh Chaat and Dosa corner to salads, bread, curries, and a huge dessert counter. Spoiled for choice, we tried all the Vegetarian dishes - the ones that really stood out were the Dal Makhni (delicious and creamy) and the Vegetable Makhanwala (crazy good gravy). The desserts were a bit of a let down though - there were so many of them, we tried the Gulab Jamun, Gajar Halwa, and Rasmalai - none of them were really impressive.The mains were terrific, the desserts not really. Another thing they really need to improve on is the music - the instrumentals were of the most depressing Hindi songs ever. Considering there was a wedding happening in the adjoining hall, it was quite ironic
3
We visited Tandoor after almost 3 years and they have completely renovated the place. The ambiance is more open and chic now and the service is top notch. The food though has dropped in quality significantly.
5
This place is incredible- amazing and impeccable service, the most tasty and non-oily Indian food, and ambiance feels like India. I love this place. My Indian friend has been telling me about this place for over two years and finally went. It exceeded expectations doesn't begin to express how great it was
5
I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and the food is consistently good. Each time I have tried something different on the menu and have yet to be disappointed, The service is par excellence, with all of the staff very friendly yet discreet. My husband has taken business colleagues to this restaurant and says the lamb dish he had was the best he has ever had in a restaurant. We had our Christmas office dinner here and everyone raved about the food. On my last visit I had the dhal curry as well as the mutton curry as I wanted to try both. Both of these dishes I would readily recommend. I dont mind recommending this restaurant as I dont live in Singapore but often come here on business. If I lived here, I would want it to be my secret restaurant to ensure I always get a table when I want a good curry. I have heard that they have a buffet on Sunday and will be going to try some of the dishes I have not had yet.
4
Having read the reviews about a renewed menu and decor a few months ago, we decided to give it a try. Admitedly, the food was much better than expected. Its conventional indian fare but with very good quality cooking and spice touches that are clearly well thought out. Ambience of the restaurant is also nicely done, only thing is the service staff doesn't blow you away but are competent never the less. Net net, we will be back when in the mood of good quality conventional Indian fare. Saha at Duxton still stands out as a class apart, but amongst the conventional/authentic places, Tandoor is right up there in my honest opinion
5
Good ambience, curteous service, excellent quality of food, bit costly but if you are staying in HOLIDAY INN ORCHARD CITY CENTRE, they give you 20% discount. The trainee staff Mr. ASHISH (JULY-2014) has provided excellent service, KUDOS to the team TANDOOR and keep upgrading your excellent service standard of hospitalit
5
Have not been here for a while. They have just renovated the restaurant , so decided to give it a try. Service was excellent , our server was Arif he was excellent. We had mauligawtany soup , fish curry n lamb briyani and nan on the side . All dishes were excellent . ..will definitely go back again . I just wished they will turn down the lighting abit which I believe will improve the ambience of the room . If you don't like air conditioning drafts , ask for seatings along the walls . Other wise food is excellent 
2
We went to this restaurant again after 2.5 years, and I must say last time we had better experience but this time it was really disappointing. The menu was changed and food tastes bland. We ordered dal makhni and kadai paneer out of which dal was really good but kadai paneer was plain tomato gravy with some bell papers n paneer thrown in. No onion, and bland! We told them that this is not kadai paneer. They changed it but again the taste was average this time with some onions in it. Guys if you charge so much, might as well follow the recipes, kadai paneer is known for its spicy taste. No doubt chef and other staff checked with us whether we liked the food this time but our dinner date was spoilt! They tried to compensate it with offering us free desserts. Hmm still I wont go back again

This was recommended by my indian friends. I dont know much abt indian food thou, I love various indian curries with Nan and tandoori chicken etc. First of all, i was surprised the luxurious and modern interior of the restaurant (I went to the restaurant without any info for surprise), second of all, I was surprised by the taste of new indian dishes I tried for the first time.Unfortunately I dont remember all names of dishes we ordered...but! Im pretty sure you can get help from nice staffs what to order. What I loved the most were bbq skew of shrimp and fish...no exaggeration, they are the best!! You should order if you go to this place. I am picky on seafood but I wanted to order more if I had a room. The biryani (vegetable, lamb) with yogurt... Omg so addictive. I went back to this restaurant later on again and ordered the same thing. The biryani still tasted the same but the yogurt was a bit strong. Of course, if u order curries, it never goes wrong. Lasi they made is also fresh and nice, perfect to refresh ur mouth. I will def come back to this restaurant soon :

Thank you Arif and all the others who served us during Sunday lunch on the 30th.Your arrangements, service and friendly behaviour was excellent.The lunch menu was good and everyone enjoyed the food immensely. It was not oily, quite flavoursome and varied.We also liked the new dÃ©cor. Look forward to coming back
5
I thoroughly enjoy a meal here with another couple who were originally from India, there was also many other people here in this booked out restaurant on a thursday night. The quality of food and staff was great the breads and dhal were especially enjoyable. I would highly recommend this restaurant .
4
They really do out on a great quality spread of food. I thoroughly enjoyed the Sunday lunch that I had there. For an upmarket meal it's certainly worth it.
4
Everything we ate was very good,specially the non vegetarian,a must do in Singapore,don't think twice before walking in,can't go wrong
5
Awesome Food,have no words for the quality and the taste they serve..I would recommend to dine if you are on visit to Singapore but food is bit expensive..
4
We went to this restaurant Diwali day as a last option as other restaurants of our choice were fully booked. We were pleasantly surprised with the ambience of the restaurant, service and last but not the least food. The spread was excellent for both vegetarians as well as non vegetarians with over 20-30 different dishes. The Nan's were some of the best I had including the times I ate in some of the best restaurants in India. Dessert course was also very good with a selection of both Indian as well as western desserts. The restaurant ambience was very elegant. Slightly pricy but definately recommend this restaurant
4
We had our anniversary here and had excellent service. The table setting and decor is they type you don't see in your average Indian place. The poppadoms are very generous when you sit down as a appetizer. Serving sizes are good and the Kulcha bread is very nice. Would suggest staying away from the spiced pineapple drink though.
5
Tandoor is probably the best indian restaurant in Singapore, cause it has excellent food for example, Dal, Butter naan, Parantha, butter chicken and raita. If you have not already gone there go there. The service is amazing cause they give you water right away. They serve you in a 3 course style like, starters like tandoori chicken. Then main course. And last thing dessert. They have made the restaurant neat and clean. The weird thing was that there were small portions in some of the dishes. The restaurant is a fine dining restaurant
5
An exquisite restaurant with tremendously commendable ambiance, service, and taste. The food was wonderfully prepared, one of the best northern Indian courses had. Customer service was superior; providing appropriate recommendations and catering to specifications. Asked for Chicken Tikka Masala, which was specially made as per my request. Staff was personable and welcoming. Price was reasonable given the quality of food. The champagne cocktail "Bollywood Bellini" was recommended by staff and definitely exceeded expectations of a truly refreshing beverage. The stories that were provided by the staff were intriguing and an enjoyable addition to my experience. The lady who worked there was particularly helpful, attentive, and amiable
5
Had dinner at this restaurant last week. Food is delicious, I felt like I got my complete money's worth. Staff is very friendly and patient. The design of the restaurant is ambient for the Northern Indian Cuisine and I will definately come back or refer this restaurant
3
Visited the restaurant and experienced great customer service.The waiters were polite and prompt.A good case in point about the excellent customer service was the fact that the restaurant staff pro-actively bought in a cup of lemon/ginger tea(without ordering) for my wife to soothe her sore throat/occasional coughing.Tried the vegetarian fare and found that the preparations were decent and all items listed on the menu were available. One of the areas of improvement would be to increase the spread/menu options and include/introduce some innovative items(which are not easily available in most Indian restaurants of Singapore).Egs-Veg Sizzler, Rajasthani Gatta curry, Gujarati style Undiyo et
5
Excellent classy Northern Indian cuisine. Food served was nicely spiced, especially the moist Dum Briyani and Tandoori Chicken. Papadam was promptly served when we just settled down. Would really appreciate if the Garlic Naan had more garlic though, haha... However, food here is a little on the high side as they are served in relatively small portions, but just enough to fill your stomachs (but not empty stomach)! Service provided by waiters and front desk staff was awesome as they were very friendly. Overall, this was a very fulfilling experience for my birthday at Tandoor
4
It was an extra ordinary experience for my friends who were trying north indian meal for the 1st time n was happy that my choice lived up to our expectations.
5
Although not cheap, it was excellent.The layout of the restaurant is clean, clear, modern and comfortable.The service is very good, efficient and rapid too.Wide selection of specialties from different Indian regions makes the menu very tempting.They offer the clever option of 2 differents sizes.Yhe food is delicate, properly cooked, spiced and well presented.Definitely a great place for lovers of Indian cuisine in a cosy environment'Congratulations
5
Food was awsome and the staff very helpful. Will defiantly go again when in Singapore. We decided to stay in Holiday Inn because it had Indian Restaruant
5
Service and food were excellent. But I happened to be there on a night where there was a big group of people... a couple were too loud. Thankfully they all stopped talking after the food arrived. I am very pleased with the wait staff and food
5
I found the service was very friendly and personal. The food quality was good with the taste of authentic Indian food. The new ambience looks amazing. I would surely recommend it to others
5
Travelled Singapore and Malaysia over the last few weeks, and our experience at Tandoor is summarised by the fact that 3 of our 6 evenings in the city were spent eating in the restaurant. We simply couldn't stay away!What made our experience at Tandoor was the stellar service provided on all 3 occasions. Our waiter, Boon Leong, ensured that we had an enjoyable experience each night, and his hospitable nature with such a kind 'nothing is too much trouble' service was a reason all in itself to visit the restaurant. I do hope the management recognise the inexhaustible effort he puts in to please all guests, as this wasn't recognisable solely on our table but also throughout the restaurant. Absolutely fantastic.The food is of extremely high standard, and as a European tourist it provides the opportunity to choose between well-known classics such as Butter Chicken and Biryani, or try something a little different ant more authentic. Crab Masala has to be a winner!Thank you Tandoor, and Boon in particular, for providing us with a fantastic memory of high-quality cuisine, service and Singaporean experience as part of our holiday. Can not recommend you enough
5
We went for a family dinner while visiting my sister and brother in law at Singapore. The staff was very warm, hospitable and courteous. The presentation of food was very nice and innovative. Almost all the items ordered by us were very good in taste and quality. Those worth a special mention are Dal Makhani, Palak soup and the kulfi. The restaurant captain was throughout with a smile and ever obliging.
5
I was traveling solo in Singapore last week and went to Tandoor on a friend's recommendation. I had a wonderful experience. The food was great, the surroundings were tasteful, clean, and spacious. The most outstanding thing about the experience was the service, which was skilled and gracious. Everyone from the busser to the GM contributed to making my visit enjoyable. This is one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had, and will definitely return to Tandoor when I visit Singapore again
4
this hotel is one of the best i found for Indian food lovers! the menu is nicely balanced for veg and non veg both the options. the staff is very good and courteous - one of the best i have seen during my visits to Singapore
5
Went to the Tandoor recently after a long absence and found the place changed. I liked the new look and the food was still very good. In fact we made 2 visits in quick succession. The first on the 3rd June, and because we were so happy with the food, we brought my son there again on the 12th June. On the second visit we were thoroughly impressed by the supervisor Nitin who treated us most wonderfully. I have been to quite a few North Indian restaurant both in Singapore and in India ( I'm a retired pilot) and I think the cooking in the Tandoor is more refined than in most other Indian restaurants in Singapore. It's close to some of the cooking in some of the better hotel establishments in India. Oh yes, loved your spinach and corn sou
4
We happily re-discovered Tandoor after a long absence. Went there first for Mother's day dinner & was so impressed with the service & menu that we went back again for Father's day!We were not disappointed! True to form , we had a gourmet Indian dinner once again & the service was again excellent. We withheld one star as the Tandoori chicken was a tad dry on Father's day.Tandoor is now back on our radar screen as our choice of an Indian restaurant
4
This is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to. Our group was a large one and the orders were done by the host. Everything that I tried was simply excellent, from the chicken tandoori to the grilled cheese and shrimp, followed by different curries and dishes, including fish, chicken, eggplants, spinach, biryani. However, my most favorite was the mango curry. I had never had that dish before and it was heavenly. Dessert consisted of pistachio ice cream with a side of fruit in rose water. The service was excellent and wait staff extremely professional. I'd highly recommend this place
5
Waiters provide good advices to help you to build your perfect menu. The Mango curry is marvellous and wine list well balanced. For a couple diner IT was a very good choice.
4
The Tandoor used to be one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Singapore, and not having been there for some years I decided to revisit. Lots had changed. The restaurant had been modernized, and in my opinion lost much of its charm. The same chefs can still be viewed slaving over a hot tandoor through the glass partition at the rear of the restaurant.The cuisine and wine are very passable, and the service staff attentive. Upon hearing that this was a return trip after a long visit, the waiter treated me to free dessert of his choosing, a very hospitable and kind gesture
2
It was very disappointing experience. One of my Singapore colleague wanted to take me to a nice Indian restaurant and suggested this. But turn out to be bad. Firstly, I saw a hair in pappad which put me off. Food taste was below average. Great ambience and looks neat. Courteous waiters.
5
Though we arrived late, but the staff was very Welcoming. Since dining with a family, every body has there own choice of selection and not to forget my wife who is pure vegetarian, we were explained very well about the concept of the restaurant along with few recommendation on Vegetarian food which my wife quickly agreed to, my liking's still stick to my Chicken Tikka Masala which was excellent but something which could beat any dish is there Mango Curry. Absolutely delicious with the nice flavored sauce with south indian spices excellently blended with ripe Mango with a balanced flavor. Liked the decor very much, Great experience and Recommended
2
We had heard and read some good reviews about the restaurant and decided to try it out. We went for the A la carte option and tried some starters as well as the main course. The only two good things about the restaurant were the ambience and the Sheekh Kabab. The rest of the food was very average. The chicken in the curry wasn't cleaned very well and some parts were undercooked. The chicken biryani was very bland and had no character to it. The service is also quite poor. Overall it is a restaurant with very poor quality of food and extremely overpriced. There are much better restaurants in Singapore serving more authentic Indian food at more reasonable prices
2
Having not been to Tandoor since the late 1990s, I was happy to learn that the restaurant - a Singapore favorite in the 1990s - had recently reopened. Following good reviews in the papers, I thought it was time to revisit an old flame. They have clearly spent a lot of money on redoing the decor and the restaurant looks pretty swish. However, as I dug into the food, I realized that this is pretty mediocre stuff. Except for a fish curry, nothing really stood out. Plenty of Indian restaurants in Singapore do this stuff better - for far less. However, I will reserve my final judgment after a return visit, as this visit may have been swayed by some of their set meal options, which may not have been the most representative
1
Visited this place with my family on a Sunday for the Sunday brunch . They have changed the decor and the concept has also been changed - from a sit down to a buffet ( with staters being served at the table ) . The kebabs were not bad , but being vegetarians , the choice was limited . The chaat section had paani puri and dahi poori - the pooris tasted a LOT like they were from the haldiram's boxed paani puri we get at Mustafa ! I am not certain about the brand ( could be bikano also , but fresh it wasn't ! ) . The main course had the usual dalMakhani and palak paneer and aloo gobi and puris which looked like they had a identity crisis - were almost like bhaturas in their thickness , but had none of the fluffiness and some breads - which were again served at the table - and all were quite mediocre .. The desserts were straight from the boxes - the frozen ones you get in Mustafa from haldiram's - the laddoos , the pista barfi , the kaju katlis , the jamoons and the ras malai also ! I was quite disheartened to have paid so much (48$ almost ) to eat stuff which just came out of a box ! There was also a creme brûlée and some pastries which looked like they had been made at the hotel , but the Indian sweets were a huge disappointment ! Just changing the decor to increase the price of the Sunday buffet is not something one would expect from a hotel of the calibre of Holiday Inn . I hope they read this review and clean up their act and give the discerning customer what he came for - fresh , tasty Indian food - and not the boxed stuff neatly displayed at the buffet
4
We have order the chicken tandoori, fish curry and lady fingers. All the dishes are good, especially the fish! We were service by Boon Leong and he was very attentive. Overall service was good
5
Food is excellent, service impeccable and beautiful ambience. Special commendation to Boon Leong, he is very attentive.
4
This is the place to go if you are looking for some good Indian Food with selection of some good wines bang at the Orchard while shopping! One of my must go places when in Singapore.
4
Both the food and service were great, despite the restaurant being crowded. I really enjoyed the butter chicken and honey dill prawns, highly recommended

We visited this place on the basis of the consistently good reviews on TA and chose this over the cuppage terrace place we regularly visit for Indian food.We did not have a reservation and the restaurant was quite busy but the manager managed to get us a table and I was grateful for this . The place was full reflecting it's obvious popularity and we really looked forward to the meal as famished after an evening out in Orchard. Our orders took well over half an hour to arrive and we put up with this as the place was busy and it takes time to put out good quality grub. However, once the food came, disappointment set in rather quickly. The tandoor/ Kabab dishes were lukewarm at best as was the steamed rice which clearly had been cooked sometime ago! The naan, measly small in size and the mango curry which is reviewed favorably on TA were relatively warm. There were no pickles, seasoned onions etc on the table which are standard in any Indian restaurant. To add to our luck, a strand of hair was fished out of the curry which was the final straw! We asked to speak to the manager who curiously avoided our table once he got wind of our unhappiness and not once did he come to enquire on what the problem was. He sent his deputy who apologized as did his hapless junior waiters some of whom were probably F&B students & reminiscent of Manuel & Fawlty Towers. On a busy weekend evening, the restaurant was understaffed and lacked stewardship and the deputy manager explained that there had indeed been an error with our order to explain the delay and why the dinner was cold . These are no excuses for a 5* restaurant . Besides, paying less attention to one particular guest next to our table who seemed to know the manager and other staff well would have perhaps helped avoid the so called confusion over orders. It was interesting that we did not see the manager at all and at no time during the meal did an attending staff enquire how we were getting along till we began complaining. If they were so stretched, refusing admission to us and other guests without reservations would have been the sensible thing to do .We were only charged for the drinks but left the place hungry with the entire evening having been ruined and wasted on the rare occasion we decided to go out without the kids. A Burger King on the way back home was the only consolation of it all- at least this was warm and delivered < 5 mts!
5
We dined here one night and were so impressed that we went back thee next night. We had a friend join us from Manilla for the weekend and took her here for a meal.. The food was lovely especially the Lamb Chops and the Chef Speciality The Mango Curry. Would travel to Singapore and this Restaurant just to have this Curry. The service was also very good and friendly
1
We planned lunch at the Tandoor as part of an internal event at the Holiday Inn. This was probably the worst decision we took since our experience marred the entire event.To begin with, there were just two service staff providing table service to a group of around 25 people. Service was excruciatingly slow. The starters, specially for the vegetarians, were a joke, both in terms of quality and quantity. The dishes used to serve food were too small for a table of six. Most items ran out after 3-4 persona were served. Replenishing the items that finished took more than ten minutes. There were times where only vegetables were available on the table and no breads, and times it was vice versa.I have never had such an experience in any restaurant in Singapore. We felt cheated
5
Excellent location , just at Singapore flyer. The family and friends had a feast with the buffet...which is value for money. The food has enough options to satisfy the different taste buds...we were a group of 7 with 2 kids. The staff was well trained for good service
5
You will be spoilt at Tandoor with their wide range of dishes carefully prepared by their Chefs. The food spread was finger licking lip smacking good. The simple yet elegant restaurant allows diners to experience the true essence of North Indian cuisine at a very affordable pricing. Highly recommended for any one who wants to be pampered
5
Was there on 14th January. The restaurant is located at the basement 1 of Holiday inn at orchard. A must to dine in place as the ambience was pretty good and relaxing. The service staff was impeccable and moreover they will share with you the stories behind each and every dish you will order. Mango curry was amazing but although tasted like a hot dessert. Nalli ghost is a must to try dish. Highly recommend this place as you will experience a wonderful service

Nice food and ambience. The restaurant is located on the bottom floor of the Holiday Inn Orchard Street. The complimentary papdums at the start were delicious and very spicy. The mint sauce and chutneys were good too. We had Daal Makhni & Chicken Tikka Masala for mains. Very good although I have had better. The mango lassi tasted like the pulp used was of unripe mangoes rather than sweet ripened ones, but this seemed the standard mango lassi taste in Singapore going by the other 2 lassis I had. Bit on the expensive side

The food was good but was pricey for what it was. It would be better to head to Little India for more reasonable prices coupled with a slight drop in quality.

Had a lunch meeting and the food was fab. Quick and efficient service and thought the open kitchen was a cool feature . Would definitely go back. All the good was hot and flavor some

Have been to Tandoor restaurant several times in the past 10 years - from the days when I was bachelor and subsequently with my family and friends. The food had always been excellent. It has been our default go-to place for major occasions such as birthdays, valentine's day and anniversaries. We always found the food worth the money paid. The restaurant was closed for renovation during mid 2013. We went recently post the renovation on my wife's birthday and the experience was not great which has forced me to write this review.Unfortunately, the quality of the food has gone down after the renovation. Even the quantity provided per dish has gone down and food is not worth the cost charged.We ordered Sheekh Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Paneer ka Soola for starters. The preparation was pretty ordinary and I would say tasted similar to stuff available in some of the Indian outlets in the various food courts available in Singapore. Why would someone pay 3-4 times the money to get the same stuff? The Paneer dish was dry and the quantity provided did not seem to be sufficient - definitely lesser than what we used to get earlierHowever the main course was the saviour else the rating would had been worse. The Paneer Makhani and Mushroom Matter tasted nice along with the Butter Naan. The revised decor is so-so. But that should not have affected the quality of food. It seems there is a rush to recuperate the cost of renovation as fast as possible and some quarters are being cut for this purpose and this will impact in the long run if not addressed.Overall the quality of the food can be better (It was better in the past). The management attention is needed in this regard. Else it will be difficult to get locals to come back again

The positives. Service is excellent. Decor is bright and modern. The fish tikka was the best I've ever had and the lamb was superb.Then the vegetables came. Far far too spicy. Nothing like northern Indian cuisine. Dishes were so spicy that we could not tell the difference between the bindi, paneer or the Dahl. A real shame because the evening started so well. Credit to the staff they removed the these dishes from the bill. I was told to order less spicy next time. I think they are missing the point. I would definitely go back for the more refined tandoor dishes as they were excellent.

I'd been to the Tandoor restaurant many years ago. Having heard about its renovation, we decided to visit again.The restaurant is in the basement of the Holiday Inn at Orchard. The new decor is simple and elegant with a thankful absence of any kitschy elements. The setting plates appeared to have come from a Chinese restaurant though. There is a open kitchen through which the tandoors are visible.We went for the A la carte menu on this visit.There was a nice variety on the menu including some options we hadn't come across before. We ordered the intriguing Murg Lemongrass Kabab and found it to be excellent. The Malmali Sheekh Kabab was outstanding as well.For the main course, we had the Murg Dum a Dum which was unfortunately very plain.We had a bread basket and each of the naans was very good.For dessert, we went in for a couple of Kulfis. The Bailey's Irish Cream kulfi was very good.Service was prompt and knowledgable.We'd probably visit again

After moving to Singapore, as Indian food lovers, I and my family have spent years to find an Indian restaurant which serves food with the right taste, and I have to say no restaurant was even close.As people know, Singapore has hundreds of thousands of Indian people and so there are lots of places that you can easily find Indian food. But the thing is, those dishes are sometimes too 'authentic', people like me and my family find it a little bit difficult to enjoy the food.To be honest, I was like almost gave up to find an Indian restaurant that suits my taste when I went to Holiday Inn last week for some errands.One of my friends suggested to go to this restaurant for lunch and I joined without too much expectation.Interestingly, The first thing I liked about Tandoor was, the lighting was just good, not too dark as usual Indian restaurants. Interior decorations were also luxurious but not too much, I could fully focus and enjoy the food. Sometimes you will find it difficult to enjoy the food only because of too dark lightings or too shiny colorful interior design that distracts you from the food.And for the food, well I have to say it was exactly the taste that I was looking for for years. We had some kind of course set menu, we didn't have to worry about ordering the right food but still were served with nice combination of sweet, spicy and plain dishes that have the right level of authenticity. I could still feel the original taste of Indian delicacies and the spices and herbs used were just right so I could fully enjoy the food.The set menu had Tandoori shrimps, chicken, lamb and scallops served with mango curry and spinach curry. There were some dishes that I've never tried before but all dishes were very satisfying and delicious.I am already planning to go there again with my family this time, my husband is also very excited after I told him about this restaurant.I definitely recommend this restaurant to those who were looking for a nice Indian restaurant but couldn't find one because of 'too authentic taste'

For full reviews, visit my website at ms-skinnyfatIf you are looking for a place for Indian fine dining, rejoice in the fact that Tandoor Restaurant is back in the game following its recent face-lift (read about my previous review here). Not only has the decor been given a modern and classy revamp, the menu at Tandoor Restaurant, Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre, has also been made more refined and delicate while retaining its traditional roots. I was even more impressed with their story telling concept as the waiters took us through the interesting history of each dish. S and I were invited to sample the Dinner Gourmet Set ($68). If you're not up for the full course, there is a smaller course at $48. Vegetarian options are also available. We started with the Samosa Chaat, a light puff pastry shell stuffed with potatoes and chickpeas and topped with sweet yogurt and tamarind chutney. I love the creaminess and contrasting flavors of the dressing and was amazed at how light the puff was. Next, a platter of kebabs. My favorite was the Paneer Chupa Rustom, a potato croquette stuffed with spinach and cottage cheese. It's like a kinder surprise! The minced lean mutton kebab was very flavorful and soft, perfect if you were a toothless Indian king (no kidding, that's how the dish came about). On to the mains which were served with saffron rice or Naans. The Mango Curry was too addictive, a unique ripe mango curry from the Mangalore region of India. The other dish that i could not stop eating was the Murg Dum A Dum, chicken curry. Best mopped up with the garlic naan. We ended dinner with a trio of desserts. From the left, the sweetened carrot dessert Gajar Halwa which had the quality of a nutty rice pudding; a Bailey's Kulfi ice cream, and a Rose and Elaichi Panna Cotta.I have to say that Tandoor Restaurant really impressed us with its new direction. I enjoyed the food a lot better than i did the first time. Even S, who would frown on my Indian meal suggestions, enjoyed his meal and even indicated his willingness to have this again. Tandoor would be having its Diwali promotion from 15 October to 30 November 2013. Diners will hear intriguing 4-part story of Ramanyana from the wait staff as they feast on the dishes. Specially designed illustrated coasters will also be given to diners who purchase the Gourmet Trail Menus

The food here is awesome. The theme of "Every meal begins with an appetizing story" is a great idea. There was a great selection of starters, which included some very local delicacies from parts of India. For once, an Indian meal was not too heavy and filling. Friendly staff and good service

This restaurant on the lower level of the Holiday Inn Orchard Centre has had a makeover in August 2013 and looks great - very nice setting for lunch or dinner. The food, Northern Indian cuisine, is great - fresh, creative and beautifully presented. The staff are professional but friendly and very attentive, happy to explain things or offer advice if needed. They are very proud of what they do. You will have a great meal in a relaxed environment and be treated very well indeed. We loved the lemongrass chicken to begin with but its hard to choose among the several dishes that followed while the Kulfi was fantastic to finish with. Don't miss this

Mouth watering dishes at a nominal price and great ambiance. Very friendly staff and interestingly they ll tell you the stories for the dishes what u r having... An amazing experience ... Ll come back again and recommend to all my friends in town...

Every time we dine in Tandoor we get extra take care from All staff and same tast of food .
This is my number one favorite Restaurant.

The food choice is very impressive and the taste of the food is of high quality
Tandoori dishes are the best, especially the prawns
I will be bringing my other friends very soon

Of all the north Indian restaurants I've been to in Singapore, Tandoor is the one. From Kebabs to Curries there's a great variety for both vegetarian and non-vegetarians. Great ambience, excellent service, mouth watering dishes and carefully chosen drinks to compliment the food- this restaurant has it all!!!
5
My husband and I absolutely LOVE Tandoor. From the moment you walk into the restaurant, it is a wonderful experience.We ordered from the prix fixe menu. Each course came beautifully presented and delicious. The server also presented us with a background story for every dish. We highly recommend this restaurant! COME HUNGRY!!

I eat here every time I stay at the Holiday Inn in which this restaurant is located. It serves high quality and genuine Indian cuisine.The menu is quite varied, certainly to the extent whereby most tastes are catered for. Service is very good and is not oppressive as can be the case in some establishments. The food itself is delicious and served in good sized portions. The only thing lacking is, we'll, nothing really..

This restaurant can easily be rated as one of the finest restaurants in Singapore for Indian Food. Wide selection of food, manner of preparation, quality, taste, and visual appeal of the food is exceptional. Restaurant decor, seating comfort, and experience is one of its kind. Service levels are true to Indian hospitality with lot of affection, care, and superb attitude. Restaurant manager with excellent support from the F&B Manager and other restaurant staff make you feel at home and yet enjoy the professional service with complete attention to details. I visited this restaurant recently (when I was staying in the hotel where this restaurant is located) on the suggestion of the General Manager of the hotel, and I am so happy that I went by his advice. I had tried this restaurant a couple of years back and even then it was a wonderful restaurant. But now with recent makeover and refurbishment the restaurant has become contemporary, stylish, and beautiful. Food has remained as good as ever or should I say has become better than before! Strongly recommended restaurant in Singapore

I travel quite a lot and I've rarely seen restaurants serving authentic India Food. This was one of the best restaurants serving good Indian food. The service was a little slow, however that was due to restaurant being overloaded with guests :-). For dinner they offer 2 fixed menus (SGD 48 & 68) apart from A la carte
3
We've been regular visitors to the previous Tandoor before the refurbishment and we had to say that we just hated what they've done with the place. The previous one felt cosy and with a bit of atmosphere even when it was quiet.The new one feels awfully clinical and just a bit too formal. The food's still pretty good but the ambience has been destroyed unfortunately
5
We were a group of 6 who went for dinner here. We opted for the set menu and were very happy with it. A very varied menu, some typical dishes (fish, palak paneer, dal makhani) and some new ones (mango curry) made the whole experience extremely satisfying. The service was also very good. Special mention for the starters which were very good. Thoroughly enjoyed our evening thrre. Definitely going back!

The buffet was just OK. A bit on the pricey side. Good if you are staying at the hotel and don't feel like venturing out.

We went to restaurant for dinner .The food with service was really good. The restaurant also has a very good selection for the vegetarians. A nice place in the heart of Orchard with the reasonable prices comparing to other Indian Restaurants in the area

The food is really good and also the servings are good . The restaurant also has a good selection for the vegetarian eaters. A nice place in the heart of Orchard and the price is also affordable comparing to other Indian Restaurants in the area

We've long been fans of Tandoor and were curious to see what the newly refurbished restaurant had in store for us. The new look is beautiful and a huge improvement on the old, more serious feel. I loved the hanging lamps, brightly colored place settings and copper tiles inside the kitchen. But the real star of the show is still the food. We had one of the set menus, which is very reasonably priced. Every course was delicious. I especially enjoyed trying some different Indian desserts. Our only grumble is the service. Whilst everyone was friendly, only one member of staff seemed to really be on the ball and knew what was going on. We had long waits in between courses. I understand that staff training is still taking place and these problems should be ironed out soon. My suggestion is to wait a month or so and then visit Tandoor for a fantastic Indian meal. We will be back

On eve of my husband's bday I decided that we should go to this place. When we reached there we found that the restaurent is getting renovated , was bit dissappointed as it was late and we had no option but to try the another restaurent in the hatel itself which had Indian menu . Well I dint liked the food much , also the ambience was ok kinds as it was very crowded and noisy. But I liked the service as it was prompt , also the manager over there arranged the cake for my hubby when I told him about his bday that too complementary. Please check before going there about the renovation thing

This gem is hidden away in the basement of Holiday inn Orchard but what a find.Great ambiance and even better food, the service is attentive and not intrusive and the whole experience was brilliant.Keep up the good work and we will be back soon

Today was my first visit to this place. This visit was for lunch with my office colleagues, we selected Non-Veg and Veg set menu. This was a 4 course meal started with soup which was Ok. 2nd serving was of kababs and these delicious and I loved them all Fish, Chicken and paneer all three were served. This was followed by main course butter chicken, mutton curry and Vegetables along with dal and naan bread and safron rice.Being a punjabi I know what is butter chicken all about and the chef had nailed it..I loved it..mutton as usual was not cooked well known/normal issue with most of the restaurants in Singapore.Final course was the Kulfi which was really mouth watering.Overall a nice place to eat, I personally liked the ambiance and cutlery. All of us enjoyed the food and I will surely visit this place again in future

This restaurant is located in the basement of a very nice Holiday Inn in Singapore.Most importantly, the food is delicious and the set menu is great value. We had a group lunch of about 10 people and it went very smoothly and we were able to sit, eat and enjoy in a relatively short period of time. It probably helped that the restaurant was almost empty at lunch.Food was really delicious, tasted authentic (Indian colleague agreed) and nicely presented. Staff were really good. Dining room feels a bit heartless and like you're sitting underground. Set menu is better value than a la carte, otherwise it would have been expensive. Not thrilled about coming to a Holiday Inn to eat but the food was good

The restaurant is located in the basement of the Holiday Inn.We visited the restaurant for dinner as we had just flown into SIngapore and checked into the Hotel.... Food: We ordered vegetarian food, and the food was delicious, in good quantity, and well presented.Service: Too slow, needs major improvement. Did not have regular glass for the kids to sip water... no way they could handle giant wine goblets.No regular sugar - only SplendaIts seems no one orders mineral water here. it took they 10 minutes to get us bottle water at room temperature (heated in the microwave).The ambience: Quiet... I wonder why: Probably the price... expensive.The restaurant is listed on Amex's website offering a discount, but the Manager refused citing 'Festive Season' - we visited on 23rd of December... so no major occasion.Options: There are 2 Indian restaurants situated at a stone's throw... in Cuppage Plaza/ Terrace (the route from the Holiday Inn Hotel to Orchard Street)Would I visit again...? probably NO.

On my own, so portions like the rice are for two, hence the cost. No real starter selection so ended up ordering two mains. Fatal mistake. Keema naan was good.
3
As cook and lover of Indian food I was keen to try this restaurant on a friend's recommendation. I did enjoy the meal but thought it was very expensive. The staff were very attentive and the service good.
2
we ordered the 2 set menus, the quantity was tiny and the bill enormous! SGD 182.00. Food was very average. eat elsewhere

When I'm in Singapore I usually stay at the Holiday Inn Orchard, which is conveniently located and good standard. The Tandoor North India Restaurant is in the basement and represent an excellent option if you don't want to go out and search in the thousands of restaurants around Orchard.Food is very good, if you like the indian cuisine (a bit spicey for my taste, but ok)Price is relatively high, but affordable (abt 120 S$ for a full dinner a la carte, it's 80 â‚¬)Only issue is service: very formal but they leave your dirty cutlery on the table... and they are slow, so slow... 1 hour and a half for a simple dinner is simplly too long (even if I had nothing else to do :-) !
5
Beautiful decor and excellent service. We ordered the MP4 platter with a variety of tandoori dishes, butter chicken curry, garlic naan and plain naan. The tandoori dishes were flavourful, beautifully presented and the lam out of this world. The naan bread was delicious and the curry simply one of the best I have had in a long time. There are a lot of choices for Indian food in Singapore so you would hope that the quality of the food, especially as the restaurant is within the hotel would be good. It surpassed my expectations. The service was refreshing. I find service in Singapore lacking, but the waiters were very polite, attentive and incredibly good.I definitely recommend Tandoor as the quality of the food and the service were outstanding
5
I found this restaurant excellent.The food was of very good quality and the service was friendly and efficient.Being situated in the Holiday Inn Orchard City hotel the prices are somewhat higher than elsewhere but I this is to be expected.All in all I could not fault this restaurant and recommend it
2
Stayed in the excellent Holiday Inn for 4 nights and decided to eat here one evening because we couldn't be bothered to go out and it had such good reviews and had so many awards. Nice decor and setting but dreadful (truly dreadful!!) service, no atmosphere and worst of all really poor food. I don't know if it was simply an off night, given some of the other reviews but I wasn't prepared to go back and find out. There are too any great restaurants of all types and price levels to even bother with this "restaurant"
4
Food is good and if you are lucky, you may get some groupon or deal coupons which can offer good value. We tried the buffet and the non-vegetarians would love the rich flavor and aroma. The gravy is rightly done and well cooked with right amount of spices which gave the chicken and fish tenderness and aroma.Vegetarians have some options too but pretty limited. Ambiance is good and the location is not great as this is at one corner from the nearest public transport spot (somerset MRT). You can take bus too and I see this is rather better option in sunny, humid singapore.Prices are reasonable for the food, location and ambiance. But the buffet deal was a steal @ 30

We were looking forward to some good Indian food in Singapore but sadly this restaurant disappointed. I ordered Peshwari Naan and a pair of very flat naan arrived with no flavouring. When I queried it another naan arrived- still flat and with dried fruit- yuk. I suppose we are spoilt in England with so many really good Indian restaurants but by any standards this was poor food and not good value for money.. All this lovely fresh fruit and veg around us in this part of SE Asia and we got poor quality dried stuff! Also the service was very off hand. Not recommended- go to a food court instead
5
We've eaten in tons of Indian restaurants, and this one is sufficiently special to draw us back, when we're in Singapore. This is a town of thousands of restaurants and street hawkers, every conceivable cuisine. If you are going to have to pay what it takes to eat well in this town, might as well do it at a restaurant that gives good value for the dollar ... in quality, taste, service
