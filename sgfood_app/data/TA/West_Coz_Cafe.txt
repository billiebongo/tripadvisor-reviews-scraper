Ordered only 3 dishes: 1. Curry fish head 2. Sambal tapioca leaves & 3. Chai Poh egg omelette. Delicious. With rice topped with the rich creamy curry sauce - awesomest.

We wanted to have a family dinner, so we came here for its simple and relaxing setting.We ordered the claypot golden chicken, prawn chicken, twin fish fried rice, assam fish head, fried baby squid and stir fried french bean. All the food was very tasty and flavorful. They had the typical 'zi char' wok hei flavor

West Coz Cafe has some fantastic dishes. My wife and I go infrequently - but we have managed to sample quite a bit. Some dishes are amazing. Some are just ok. Some favorites: Nyonya Lady Fingers, Sambal Kangkong, and Oat Sotong. I like the Pandan Chicken but my wife thinks it's only ok. My wife thinks West Coz is better than Island Cafe Penang across the road. I disagree - but both are pretty excellent. I don't think you can go wrong with either. Food is a bit salty at West Coz! Calm down a bit

The place is very popular and I have never seen it empty. On an average expect to wait atleast 30-40 minutes especially if you are a group of 4 or more. We tried out one of their set meals for 9 people. The meal came with soup, seafood fried rice, curry fish head, cereal prawn, scallops & some veggies, chicken, tofu and a beverage of your choice. They didn't seem to have hot chocolate though it was on the menu. The waiter recommended hot milo instead and it was quite good as well. So no complaints there. Surprisingly the food didn't take long to arrive, which was good since we waited a good 40 minutes before getting a table to sit. The yummy food makes it well worth the wait. However I might prefer to make a reservation the next time I plan to go there, to skip the queue. The set came up to about S$212 for 9 people and we carried over the cereal prawn that we couldn't finish. Eating the cereal prawn was a task in itself since it was a fight to get the prawn out of the shell. Many of us didn't try the prawn because we didn't want to fight with the food ;) But the ones who tried it did say that it was quite tasty and well cooked. Looking forward to my next visit to try the other dishes :

West Co'z Cafe is in my top on my list whenever I feel like eating Curry Fish Head. This dish includes half fish head with generous amount of vegetables like long beans, ladies fingers and brinjals together with "Tau Pok" is so delicious that you do not need other dish to complete your meal. Another recommended dish is Lemon Chicken, the sauce is just perfect. Not so tangy or sour. Recommended the one at West Coast Plaza as the one at Yew Tee Point do not taste as good

in Singapore, everyone runs after the signature stuff, but while I like that dish, I really was in the mood for their awesome Claypot golden chicken which has the best sauce for this in the entire West of Singapore, if not altogether! Some awesome broccoli with scallops and some cuttlefish made a perfect Sunday lunch with a friend. Without reservations - yes they are *advised*, but that's also the typical show, you can just go and try! I am also not clear why people call this Thai or semi-Thai; there are some Thai-ish dishes here, but for someone who like me recently lived in Bangkok, I'd say this is mildly Nyonya, not Thai. Finally, restaurants in Singapore, let alone mall ones, are often not really nice, but rough and business like in a curt way. This is a really NICE restaurant, means from the senior managing lady to the cleaner staff, people are genuinely friendly and courteous. Way more so than at any other restaurant in the West Coast area! For me, this goes a long way, and so I will certainly be back, hopefully often

Good and economic casual dine in.Do make reservations for weekends or Friday nights. Else expect to wait from 20-45minutes for a table. Very popular for their spicy succulent curry fish head. For those whom prefer fish slices, they have that too. Menu is pretty good and available with set meals for two or more. Lonesome for a home cooked meal? Come here and satisfy your tastebuds. Else just drag a friend along to finish that awesome spicy curry. :)

We have been to West Coz to take dinner many times. Their famous curry fish head and Assam curry fish head are awesome. And they are reasonably priced at about 20plus dollars per dish. Taste wise is.yummy. This restaurant also serve set meals. The portion are big and taste yummy. Also highly recommend their prawn paste chicken wings. Overall is a nice place to have your meal there, reasonably priced, busy yet polite staffs and wonderful and tasty dishes

This is one the better tze char style restaurant here at west coast. The fish head curry is a must-eat and the rest of the dishes are outstanding too. Prices are very competitive.

Had lunch for three person and we ordered SG bee hoon, egg beancurd, kangkong etc the normal stuff but not the fish head curry though. Saw many people eating that. Had the tom yum too was.. so-so but nothing really that outstanding. A good place for halal gathering anyway

Our Family ( 6 of us) gad the dinner on the 21.11.2016.We ordered the set which consists of the so called authentic fish head.Taste of the curry fish-head is only so-so. The fish head is very very small!Other dishes are okay except the chicken wrapped in banana leaf. It is tasteless! We ordered 9 pieces and left 3 pieces! We did not tell the waitress as there were so many customers there! We hope this review will alert the restaurant management. Service attitude is good and staff are good manner

This place is located at level 2 (top floor) next to a nail spa & immediately after you come up from one of the escalators of West Coast Plaza which was previously called as Ginza Plaza. It is a halal eating place & the signature dish claimed is fish head curry. We went around 6 of us on a Saturday late afternoon near 2 pm & got the seat immediately. There is another place further down which serves Hong Hong food but since it was totally empty we opted for West Co’z Café. It has some several tables spread across the mall area & signage of the food is illustrated prominently. The staff is still learning but was helpful. The baby chair was provided since we had a kid. They offer soup, salad, bean curd, egg, fish, crab, squid, prawns, chicken & beef. We settled for one plain rice for each person & around 6 dishes of orders including Kang Kong, Hot plate bean curd, clay pot golden chicken, lime juice, butter squid, oats prawns, etc. The chicken was a bit chewy & butter squid had too much batter rather than the squid in the. The bean curd hot plate did not sizzle when it was served. The food overall is OK & reasonable. Insightsuit's guest loved the Hong Kong noodle

Came here with a few friends of mine for lunch. Bump into this place while I was checking the West Coast Plaza. Decided to give the restaurant a try. The foods live up to it reputation. Noticed lots of office people during lunch time. Most of them came here for the either the curry or Assam fish head. Indeed the curry fish head is excellent. Highly recommend to give this place a try when nearby. It is Halal so no worry for Muslim friends

We ordered both the assam and curry fish head and we were disappointed in both as the fish had a smell and was not even fresh at all. Told the server about it but she does not seem to know what to do

We've been going to West Cos since it opened around 2009 but this is the first time giving a review. During the week this place is crowded at lunch. The food here is Malaysian Chinese style and Malay dishes. They are known for Fish Head Curry, which is excellent. The lemon chicken is excellent, Kang Kong prepared many ways (Thai Style is great) and one unique dish is the Golden Beancurd, which is superb. Last time the Pandan Chicken was a little disappointing, not much taste. Decent prices and it is best to go in groups and share. Highly recommended

Went with a few friends for a quick dinner. Amply staffed n orders were take quickly. Food was served after a short wait. We ordered fish head curry(Assam style), fried eggs, hot plate tofu and fried baby squid. The fish head I would strongly recommend. The fried baby squid was well done as well, tasty. Would likely return to try their other dishes. Prices reasonable. Recommend you give it a try.

Have been to this restaurants for many years. It serves Halal food and it is always full of people but one just need to make a reservation at the restaurant and the staffs will call you when there is empty table for you. Although crowded, they are polite and patient.The food is very tasty, highly recommend their curry fish head. Other dishes such as prawn paste chicken wings, oat prawns etc are not bad. Very reasonably priced with that kind of portion size. Overall, it is a nice place for family dinner
