Not the best quality soba I had, but the set meals are quite filling. For instance, it contains a hot/cold soba, rice bowl, and side dishes. Waiting time isn't that long either.

A good meal :) had cool soba, like the aroma. Except it was a little squeezing but for the taste, I'? Ok with that. Worth a visit.

Ordered the tendon soba weekday set lunch. Soba was good but not the tempura. Tempura flour was not fluffy and light enough.

My friend and I normally avoid eating soba because we find them too thick for our liking. However, we tried the soba at Yomoda Yosuke recently and were surprised that we actually enjoyed the noodles!During that first visit, we ordered the Yomoda Curry Set, Kakiage Don Set and the Tempura Platter. All decently priced within most budgets!The unique soba, served cold, was smooth and highly palatable and enjoyable: something different from our usual foodfare

It's been a while since we last visited a soba shop and it's exciting to walk pass one which was Yomoda Soba.Actually, soba is relatively a simple meal and the shop advertised on no msg and that's good. We have to remember we are in Singapore and I would say that the taste came close to the taste we had in Japan. No frills but craving satisfied.Price wise pretty competitive

We tried both soba and rice... both are just as disappointing. Not good quality rice, pork cutlet is really tough.... soba is tasteless and the noodle texture is like under-cooked instant noodle, not something that you would expect in a soba shop. The service however is good, staff is attentive but after all, quality of food is important. Could have gotten better food elsewhere

The outlet was located at the fourth level of the mall, facing the foodcourt. It originated from Japan. The outlet had limited seating and the place filled quite fast during the lunch hour. Tempura Seiro Soba (S$23)A variety of prawn, braised pork, chicken, parprika, pumpkin, and kidney beans, dipped in tempura batter and fried, served with a dipping soup.The white 'Sarashina' soba noodle which was made freshly on site everyday with 100% buckwheat from Nagano Japan, was light and smooth. With the cold dipping sauce, it was refreshing to have especially when Singapore's weather was usually quite hot.I was surprised to find braised pork in the tempura. Encased with a thin crispy crust, the fatty pork was quite tender and I did not feel jelat although the layer of fat was quite thick. My favourite piece of tempura. Can't help wishing that the outlet could offer a plate of braised pork tempura on the menu. However the kidney bean was a tab disappointing as it was cold inside.Dashimaki Tamago ($7)Japanese style egg roll The layers were distinct, and the roll was soft and pillowy although it was more on the salty side but just right to go with the plain soba

In a nutshell: 5 stars for service, 3 for food. We found the soba to be a little coarse and the tempura batter too thick. The dipping sauce for the cold soba was also too salty for my taste but the broth for the hot soba was tasty and just right. The service staff was excellent: attentive, accommodating, forthcoming and polite. The food just needs tweaking
