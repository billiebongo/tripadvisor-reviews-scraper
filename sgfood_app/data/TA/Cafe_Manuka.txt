Win win for everyone.

A nice no frills, simple but nice food and service at a good price. Corn Fritters with avo, sour cream and bacon or salmon a great pairing and not that deep fried fritters style that is so popular now.

Excellent coffee served here. They make an awesome lamb sandwich on rye. Their ham and cheese sandwich was excellent too. Highly recommended.

The toast served here is splendid... On its own or with an array of spreads like butter, jam or peanut butter. Coffees and teas are good too. ‚òïÔ∏è Just the place for a morning perk-up! üëçüèº

Found this cafe by accident. Has gluten free bread and gluten free pasta as well as a gluten free cake available. Located at the top of the escalator on the top floor.

If you are in Paragon, this is the place to eat, the food was simple and really well done, the coffee was perfect and the juices fresh and ice free. Definitely worth a stop.

A nice coffee shop near the rooftop of Paragon. Ordered a pizza - ham and pineapple, which was superb - good size for one. Had the lemon drizzle cake for dessert. Never been to the top of Paragon previously so not seen this eatery. Good attentive service and nice comfortable seating. This is inside the mall, but not within a enclosed area - open plan. Located at the top of the escalator.Excellent option. Only downside it attracts mothers waiting for their children from nearby tuition centres with the peace interjected by exuberant children from time to time. Recommended!

Ive been there twice just to buy takeaway coffees while the children play at the playground. Each time is a different crew that served me. Theres a older guy that makes good coffee the younger lady less so. Whats shocking was that i was forced to pay service charge for takeaway coffee! I hope they dont keep doing this. Service charge is for inhouse dining service NOT for takeaways. Hope management notices this and rectifies this ASA

We went twice because the coffee was so good.The first time we shared a chicken sandwich, different from what you expect ,but hunks of chicken in a really tasty toasted sandwich hit the spot, next time scones ,jam and cream BUT both times great coffee, great creme and friendly staff.5th floor of the paragon centre is where it is

Nestled in the famous kids floor of Paragon, the cafe gives parents and expectant mothers a place to have a break. The coffee was very good. The roast lamb sandwich was also tasty and fresh. Service was good and even though I spent a lot of time there at no time did I feel any pressure to leave. Nice plac
