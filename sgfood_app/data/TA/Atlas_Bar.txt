If you visit Singapore this bar is a "must" there is nothing else like it anywhere in the world.
The bar stocks over 1000 different gins.

Outside the building has some great architecture and will draw you in top the sheer beauty of the the ATLAS bar.We went during the day and bookings may be needed as evenings get busy and we will make this a more than once visit next time. Roman Foltan (head bartender) was exceptional and was the highlight of our visit. Stunning place to visit and one of the great bars of the world candidate.We cannot wait to visit again as we left it late on our week long break in Singapore. Credit to the owners who have created this experience.Prices are not high end despite the surroundings and another added bonus.(There is a lot of Gin here but menu caters for all tastes

The place was within walking distance from the MRT station. Although it was weekday, the place enjoyed a healthy flow of customers. For the 3 of us, we were showed to a table with a sofa and 2 armchairs. After looking through the menu, we decided on the 3 course lunch set(S$48++). Still and sparkling water was chargeable at S$2++ per person.For the starters :'cavolo monachina' green cabbage, pine nuts, raisin, anchovies (S$20++)Savoury cabbage which reminded one of chinese style braised vegetable filling for spring roll, with the nuts giving it texture. 'frittata di pasta' spaghetti and eggs, broccoli rabe, sausage (S$22++)It was like a pancake made of spaghetti and eggs, topped with broccoli and slices of sausage. Slightly dry but flavourful.'uova in purgatorio' tomato soup and runny egg yolk... in the shell (S$18++) The dish was served in egg shells which were held upright by salt, accompanied with buttery soft toast soldiers. Underneath the foam, was the tomato soup, packed with mouthfuls of vegetables, plus the egg yolk right below. It kind of balance the sour taste of the tomato soup.For mains : 'baccala' salted cod, gaeta olives , capsicum neapolitan style (S$29++)Light battered fish, which tasted slightly salty but firm and meaty. braised lamb, green peas, zucchini, fresh mint 'alla scapece' (S$30++)The lamb was quite tender and sliced easily. None of the gamey taste but it was bit too heavily flavoured. maine lobster roll, artisanal brioche bun, marie rose dressing (S$30++)Topup S$4++ for set The bun looked kind of hard but it was lightly crispy and buttery. Stuffed with finely chopped pickled vegetables and juicy lobster meat, it was quite appetizing. Lastly the desserts : 'baba' infused with frangelico liqueur, whipped mascarpone cream (S$14++)The baba were cute little buns which were soft and moist. Could not get enough of them.fried 'struffoli' dough, honey and cinnamon parfait (S$14++) Light crispy puffs paired with ice cream.ATLAS signature madeleines, jam and chantilly cream (S$14++) It looked simple, but I was blown off by the lemony moist texture

This place is amazing. The staff are attentive, the venue is stunning and an amazing Art Deco replica considering it was only opened in 2002. The one caveat is that it is a touch pricey, but that is born out with the service and quality of drinks. I would probably recommend coming for a cocktail or two, and only dining here if you want to spend a good chunk of money. That way, you get to spend time in the venue and not spend quite so much money. That said, if it’s a special occasion, then why not! The staff will also create whatever you want to drink, even if it’s not on the menu, which is always the sign of a great bar!It’s probably best to book a table, and bear in mind that there is a dress code after 5.30pm. I’m not sure what exactly it is, but as we were wearing shorts (I think), we were told that we would have to be finished by that time.

Great ambience but that’s about it. Cold service & snobbish. Nice To take overseas visitors to but not for regular visi
5
Gin heaven - a whole wall of gin. And if gin is not your thing, there are so many other drinks, alcoholic or non-alcoholic, from which to select.But really, the main thing is the look, the feel, the architecture and the ambience.I really believe that a visit to Singapore should include a visit to Atlas
5
One of the best bars I have ever seen in my life.... try the negroni with gin’ca gin from Peru , excellent
5
We had a fabulous time at this gin bar! We sat at the bar and enjoyed spending time looking through the extensive menu. The bar man was brilliant recommending gins that we might like to try. A classy, fabulous bar
4
The hot young thing on the SG scene isn’t that young anymore, and is styled in a 1930’s Art Deco. Instagram bar porn of the highest order, and you haven’t even sat down yet.To sit down I recommend that you book. Atlas is crazy popular right now and they - very nicely - don’t pack people in. Everyone gets some comfortable space.300+ gins is daunting, so spend some time chatting with the team there, my experience is that they’re all very knowledgeable and the bartenders are excellent. Personal favorite is a Pothecary Dry Martini with olives. Enjoy
5
Probably the biggest and best gin bar in the world!! With over 1000 gins there is something for everyone and more!! The cocktails and champagne on offer just add to the experience and this is one place where you could spend forever, especially as a gin lover!! Great atmosphere and service to go with its unique setting definitely worth a visit

This was the most spectacular bar I have ever seen. It has to be seen in person as the whole place is huge and with what looked like cathedral like ceilings! It turns out the second level was fake after I asked how one got up there. That was a tad disappointing, but nonetheless, the highlight piece de resistance was the super tall shelves containing their liquor. We tried to ask the waitress to recommend something that would require access to the top shelf without much success. I think the bartender stepped up a couple of rungs on his ladder to get our gin. Apparently when they first opened, they had girls dressed in angel outfits that would be hooked up to a contraption that lifted them up. That would have been impressive to see! In any case, a reservation ahead of time is highly recommended, though we were seated quite quickly (though it had a 90 minute max period
5
This place is even more breathtaking than the photos that have been posted. If you like the deco look, this is a must see stop in Singapore. The room is elegant. Even though they allow shorts in the room before 5:30 pm, I did feel a bit underdressed wearing them, but we plunged in anyway! They offer a staggering selection of gins, as well as other cocktails. We had the classis C&T, with their own tonic, and it was excellent, and for Singapore, relatively reasonably priced at S$17. The drinks were served with a small container of sweetened popcorn. We really enjoyed the drinks and the setting. Definitely worth a visit

It a surprise as we walked into this place. I don't think I've ever, ever seen a bar like this. It was mammoth. The bar would be like 20 feet by 50 feet and houses 100s of varieties of Gin from across the world. Rightfully called Atlas, the interiors are also done extremely tastefully. The bar menu is another sight. The hostesses know that they will have to give you time to make your selection. There are two menus from the bar. One, the elaborate and probably a hundred pages only Gin menu which is organized by country, type and then cocktails. The other is the not so elaborate non Gin menu. The food options are also great, but you wouldn't bother as you will by now be completely awestruck with what in front of you. The best part is that if you wish, they will give you a tour of the bar as well. This is a must visit place if you are going to Singapore. I can assure you irrespective of whether you're a drinker, or a non Gin drinker, you will thank me later for recommending this place. Take a look at some of my pics.
5
Simply amazing as the place is unique. The size, the structure, the ornate steel work, the tower of gin, the service, the simplicity, the choice of gin from anywhere in the world, the comfort; I have said enough I hope for to make this a place you go to for a gin and tonic like no other
5
Stopped in for lunch and to surround myself in this architectural masterpiece. It's just so beautiful. Lunch was delicious and the service was impeccable. Can't wait to visit again
5
I've been at Atlas for a pre dinner drink and this place is awesome! The style so breathtaking and straight from the 1920s the staff is friendly and pretty quick. We've stayed at the counter with the barman making the cocktails right in front of us and I can't be disappointed! Super suggested! If you want a nice table I recommend to book earlier
5
Blown away by everything. The setting , inside and out( fantastic sculpture park) and to put together a gin menu and delicious food in such a fabulous room was wonderful. No need for conversation as people watching and checking out the details filled us with happiness. The staff were great and efficient and helped us out for my birthday as it didn’t occur to me to make a booking. Loved this place
5
I booked here as Raffles was closed for refurb and reviews looked promising and all I can say is wow! What an afternoon tea! Puts the Burj al Arab i previously reviewed to shame and at a fraction of the price. Beautiful service and stunning decor. Lovely to see ladies dining dressed in 1920’s attire too. Drink menu is vast and so well prepared. Afternoon tea is beautifully presented and plentiful! Smoked salmon on rice cracker was beautifully prepared. Every item was created with such care and attention to create small mouthfuls of the most Devine combinations. Burj al Arab afternoon tea, went once for the occasion but would not return. Atlas bar, worth the 13 hour flight! The only problem was you don’t want to leave. Cost- 2 x afternoon tea 3 x champagne 2 x Gin and tonic (very tasty)£127 (you will not be disappointed of hungry)Note - Dress appropriate to the location. It is stunning and after 1700 no shorts and flip flops is enforced which adds to the class of this amazing place
5
A Very Beautifull Bar in Singapore. I realy in love with the interior design. I feel like in the middle of New York in a year of 1950's. Great cocktail as well. Love i
5
Excellent place to visit if your not concerned about your hip pocket.Food is superb, excellent cocktails and wine list.Fantastic place if your looking for an up market and stylish atmosphere.Will definitely make it a regular every time in Singapor

Beautiful design and grand entrance. Feels like on the set of the Great Gatsby. Amazing display of bottles.
5
Was afraid to visit it after the renovation (ex Divine), but, unexpectedly, it became much better in all aspects - a soft lounge music, the customer service, a wide selection of drinks and they got some food options! The place is famous for gin/juniper from all over the world!
5
The interior and atmosphere of this place really took my breath away.It is so beautifully done out and the drinks are so delicately presented, it makes you feel as though you have stepped into a scene from the Great Gatsby!Please do not walk in, have your drink and walk out. Take your time walking around the building and really appreciate the Art Deco interior and exterior.The only thing I will say is that this is not a cheap place to swing by and grab a drink. Our four cocktails was about $120, so really take your time, enjoy the drink and soak up the atmosphere of the place
5
I just loved the building itself. It is so nice to see something beautiful rather than a boring glass box. Inside the Atlas bar is as beautiful as any of the pictures look. We came by around lunchtime for a drink. Fantastic drinks menu. I had the Scandal water cocktail which was divine and my husband had a boring old gin and tonic! $50SGD for the two but worth it just for the location and sheer elegance. Music was a bit loud for that time of day with so few people. I get they are trying to create an atmosphere, but you need to get the level just right for the time of day. Thankfully the music suited the venue and was not trashy house music :
4
I would recommend the place if you want to host a small groups for drinks (for business) or simply chilling out with a couple of friends in late afternoon. (1) The tall, wall of drinks, is impressive - and the environment is nicely done up with a classic look, surrounded by leather sofa. (2) Staffs are attentive - and happy to provide you suggestions on drinks or light appetizers, and it has a wide selection of drinks, esp. gin & rum. (3) I like the atmosphere of the place - and as you ease into the evening, the bar does dim the lights and turn it into a more relaxing, soothing environment. And I find it to be a great place to chill out for a small crowd over a couple of drinks before one proceed to dinner, and there are quite a lot of eating places around. Hence, Atlas is an ideal rendezvous point for folks who work around Suntec/Bugis/Beach Road area
5
Came here a couple of months ago but couldn’t get a table. Tried again last night with friends from out of town. Finally got a table. Am Glad we came back, it’s a lovely bar. The drinks menu that went on like a novella..... Had a lychee martini- the best one I’ve had ever! Will come back for sure!
5
Yes this review have a bold tittle, but I assume it ;).Situated at the ground flour of an astonishing Art Deco building in the center of Singapore it offers a huge contrast with Singapore modernity.I knew the building and the boring tea venue that was in its lobby. What a surprise to see that now is a top level Bar. The interior of the lobby is magnificent.Then this new venue as surprise us at every level, staff, quality of the menu, execution of the drinks and snacks that are high level cuisine.Only attention be careful at the etiquette after 17:00 (no shorts) and I found it right the venue deserve itTake a tour through their Gin list or outstanding wine collectio
5
Went to this bar early evening for a some pre-dinner drinks. The first thing that strikes you is the mananimity of this place. The bar occupies the entire lobby space of this huge building and is done up like the set of a"Batman" movie. The tables are well spread out and overlooking the tables is a huge 'Alcohol Library' where all the spirits are stored and one has to literally use a ladder to access them. The cocktails here are delicious and we went for the Atlas Martini and the Young Churchill alongwith with sides of French fries. A definite must on your to do list in Singapore
5
You have to see this place... the uniqueness and attention to architectural detail is amazing! Fortunately the food, drink, and service are great too. You really should go here to look around even if it’s to just have a drink... but you might end up dining there as well after you see the food go by
5
We were told by a local that this was THE PLACE to have a Singapore Sling and he was right. Even if you don't come here to eat or drink you should come to look at this simply stunningly beautiful bar/restaurant art deco building. Check out the prices as our Singapore Slings cost $30 USD each. We sat at the bar
1
Stuck up pretentious nonsense. My family and I had intended to visit 1 Altitude (and were dressed accordingly), but decided to head somewhere indoors as it was raining, however we were turned away because our clothes didn't meet the fashion tastes of the staff. I might have expected something like that at a trashy nightclub in the '90s, but not at a place like this in 2017. It just smacks of arrogance and a lack of respect for paying customers. Avoid at least until they have a serious rethink about how they treat patrons
5
Class and great service Not cheap but well well worth it. Amazing building. Chilled opulence. If you can't impress here then give up

Just had a lunch birthday at Atlas.The deco was fantastic BUT.... everything else is BAD.I ordered the lobster risotto, but the risotto was hard. I told the server and the replied was the risotto was done al dente. It is not my first time having risotto, having travelling around the world and visited Italy many times, I can differentiate al dente and under cook very well. They were not apologetic about it and took my dish to have it recook. It took another 20 mins to wait for the dish to be served.After that I waited another hour for the dessert after I've finished my main. I've asked the server to check if it's done yet otherwise I'd like to cancel it as I was rushing for doctor appointment. She didnt come back to me after she checked with the kitchen and I had to ask another server to check and the other girl said they had cancelled the dessert w/o even informing me. It was a bad experience overall at the Atlasbar and I will never step into this restaurant anymore. Bad food, bad attitude of the staff and the slow service turned me off completely
5
Walking back from the Arab village and Haji Lane we discovered this great find. First you notice the amazing art sculptures above the road and then walk up the stairs to see Botero’s work and then the Dali’s and a few other beautiful pieces. It gets better, walk inside the building lobby to discover this beautiful Art Deco decor right out of The Great Gatsby novel or movie for those younger. The bar(s) are magnificent and so cool. But beware, you need to make a reservation 48 hours in advance for High Tea. So they can personalize your tea and dining experience. Next go up to the 3rd floor to see the Free Museum floor. What a great find
5
The setting feels like a theatreThe music is energisingThis combo creates a classy and punchy atmosphere, a sheer delight !The staff is attentive to detailBooking is a smart move, the place is quite popula
4
A beautiful bar with fantastic atmosphere and an amazing selection of gin. Unfortunately the service is not up to par with the venue. It took about twenty minutes just to get someone to take a drink order and another 15 for them to bring us a pot of tea which was yet to steep. Overall you’re paying a high price with an already included gratuity for the service, you might expect it to be of a bit better standard
5
They did everything right and created what instantly became my favourite bar. Great staff, cocktails and ambienceThe stunning building and interiors are matched by an excessive drinks menu. 1000 gins was really impressive, but the extensive champagne and single malt choices left me stunned. We had a few snacks which were very tasty and well presented. Service was world class. Unobtrusive, always there when needed, very knowledgeable and customer focussed. The interior design is jaw-dropping and very well done. Think of Fitzgerald’s Great Gatsby or Rand’s “The Fountainhead” (or maybe the Downton Abbey in the later stages) and you’ll know what I mean. Cannot wait to get back there.
5
Love this place for the ambience & great drinks (gin, gin and more gin). I went with with a friend tonight and we where lucky to grab the last seats at the bar. Music is great and not too loud - actually, we could have a decent conversation. Drinks are special and delicious. Bar food was nice too.All in all my new favorite in Singapore
3
An amazing selection of gins from all over the world. Service was attentive and interactive. We ordered various GT and Gin cocktails. GTs were disappointing, lack of good sized ice which dilute the experience and not cold enough glassware. Very basic but makes a difference between good and great bars.Bar snack of popcorn was well done, bring not overtly sweet.
5
Great vibe, beautiful bar, and good service! When the bartender forgot our fries, he threw in two complementary digestif! The photo below doesn’t do it justice

Located in my favourite buiding in Singapore the Parkview Square.  This building to me stands out as the most iconic building in Singapore. Ok, the newer Marina Bay Sands building is much more unique though this certainly has to be the most decadent building, said to be the most expensive too. This also has most decadent bar I've seen in Singapore too, it's for sure the best stocked bar, what other bar thrives to have all the world's gins, at the time of writing they had 1081 different gins - that's impressive.  Ok yeah, the gin trend has hit big time. There's probably no need for 90% of the gins on the market if you have decent cocktail mixer, however for those who like a change, you can't go wrong here. NOTE: you do however need to ask for one of the senior bar staff if you want a not so common cocktail or something a bit different, if you like that kinda thing as I do.  Some of bar crew aren't that savvy with lesser common cocktails. Prices are on the high end but for the setting and Singapore prices, it's actually not too bad
5
Opulent, comfy furnishings, gin lovers dream. What a fab place even if your not a gin lover. We were lucky to be visited by the fairies that night. Brilliant original idea, a must visit
5
My wife and I sought out the infamous Atlas Bar this past week and we were amazed as soon as we arrived. The art decor, the ambience, etc., were simply amazing. After a short wait, we sat at the bar and were attended to by Russell. Russell served us the best Gin inspired drinks we’ve ever had. I ordered a “Dealers Choice” and he replied by asking me where I was from. He then took my answer and came up with flavors that I may be use to. Then he allowed us to try a few Gins to see where our tastes truly were. I can’t say enough about our experience there. We have traveled to quite a few countries and drank at many bars; however, I must say this was by far the best bar I’ve seen. Thank you again, job well done.
5
This looks like something out of Gotham City!! The inside is so beautifully done and the array (and extent) of the alcoholic beverages available is breathtaking. This was an awe inspiring way to while away some time in the afternoon. The atmosphere, the staff, the ambience, the food and the drinks all meld together perfectly
5
Ranked recently as one of the best bars in Asia I had been planning a visit for a while. I was very impressed. First the place itself is fabulous. Beautiful building, both inside and out. The drinks menu is a drinks enthusiast's dream with a whole book on Gin (probably 300+), excellent cocktails and a good wine list. The food is fantastic, the menu is good without being too expansive. The food we had (2 mains and 2 desserts) was excellent. And the service was top notch. This place excelled at the finer details also. It wasn't overly expensive (by Singapore standards) either.
1
I have been there since Divine Society days....service was excellent in those days including my recent visit. Unfortunately, when I tried to make a call today for a reservation of 4 for this coming Mon, I was met with a rude & curt response by a telephone staff called Ruby. Surely an elegant establishment can have a better trained staff to handle phone call. I shifted my dinner to another establishment for a more pleasant outcome.
5
Dress up nice and visit this place!! It is worth it! You can drink everything but it is the biggest gin and tonic bar in the world! This place is so cool! And so beautiful! The bartender was really nice and made us 2 amazing gin tonics! Seats at the big bar are the best!! We had the best night there! Go go go!!!
5
Needless to say, the decorations are stunning and breathtaking!!!! The venue is very classy and you definitely need a reservation in advance to get in. If you are looking for a nice, fancy place for drinking. Atlas is the right place to go. Never worry if you are over-dressed. Cocktails and service were great too. highly recommend :
5
I discovered this place when I walked into a quiet office building. I was amazed by the deco, lighting, and the over ambience that truly relaxing for drinks and food.
5
We went to the Atlas Bar on October 24th, 2017 and had the most amazing night. We already stopped by two days earlier to reserve seats but unfortunately all were booked already. When we came back the lady at the counter instantly recognized us, leading us to the bar where we got great seats. Because we've already stopped by we each got a glass of champaign on the house - what a great gesture!The gin collection is impressive and one of a kind. Ranging from bottles from 1910 to contemporary gins from all over the world. Our bartender was amazing, guiding us through and recommending us great drinks whilst sharing his passion for his job with us. Upon request, he even took the time to show us around on the gin tower. Obviously, the drinks aren't cheap (ranging from 20SGD upwards) but definetely worth it! For gin lovers and people who enjoy a great bar this is a MUST in Singapore and i can wholeheartedly recommend this bar
4
We (5 of us) came here for birthday celebration. The set lunch menu is valued for money plus we were lucky that they had champagne days on October 20-21 which we could get great champagne in cheaper price.The lunch was so amazing , check out the photos. The beef was so tender, it melted in your mouth. We enjoyed our meal there very much. The place is good for hanging around with friends, couple as well as for business meeting (lunch). The service was good.However, don’t expect any special treat from them if you celebrate any occasion (we do expect something from such a classy bar/restaurant right?) We just got ‘happy birthday ma’am’ when we checked the bill.
5
Visited with husband and friends. Absolutely amazing architecture. Art Deco.....very impressive. Loads of gin...great for gin lovers. Service pleasant and the loos have heated seats!! You must go...well worth a visit.
5
Absolutely blown away with the art decor, ambience, music, Gin list, and the fooood.Yes, the food is amazing, and creative. Very interesting olives, oysters (with fizzy grapes), hand made wild mushroom pasta with black truffle and my favorite madeleines Went for a drink and a snack and ended up with the full works.Service was very good, maybe the sommelier needs to brush up a but on corks.Will definitely go again, probably book for larger parties. We were seated after a 30 minute wai
5
Best bar I've ever been to. Located near to Bugis MRT, within 10-15 min. We don't want to smell stinky and sweaty when walk-into the bar so we decided take uber. Staff at the reception so friendly and took our name under the waiting list. We were just two and waited 30min for our bar seat as the bar is busy. Most tables reserved for big group The gin tower is the highlight, more than 3000 types of gins available on the separate menu. If are gin lover, ask for the menu. Most of the cocktails and gin price btw 25-30 SGD but worth for it. Complimentary bar snack provided: tomato flavor popcorn. Love it! Overall, best bar ever. Should go and have a drink.
5
Whether it's a coffee, snack, meal, cocktail, dinner, wedding reception , fashion parade this is by far the best venue in Singapore and one every visitor should pamper themselves with.Excellent and largest selection of teas, spirits, wines, champagnes and cocktails l have found anywhere. Food is divine easily 5-6 star.Staff are excellent.This is one place to have on your bucket list
5
Absolutely stunning bar. First in Singapore with 1000 gib bottle tower concept. Excellent selection of all alcohol. Even unique small batch stuff from the states. A little posh but very charming
5
A touch of finesse and Art Deco beauty. Perfect venue to unwind for a relaxing afternoon tea time, paired with attentive service. Beautiful crafted food and an extensive good listing of tea
5
Long time since I have been in a bar where you can confortable seat and enjoy your drink in an environment where you can actually talk with your friends. The bar specialize in Gin and they claim to have the largest Gin collection in the world. The environment is stylish and relaxing with beautiful decoration.Perhaps the only missing is that service is restaurant standard and they are missing the opportunity to further differentiate
5
This place is oozing with class and a great place to spend a business dinner or a first date to impres
5
This is probably the best deco restaurant and bar in Singapore. The design is like you are in a mixture of renaissance, Egyptian, romantic atmosphere. For this tastefully design and classic design when I browse through the menu and the drink list I think is absolutely worth every penny. A la cart menu from as Low as $10 from the starters and dessert to around $40 for main course. They also have superb choices for lunch menu for 2 and 3 courses choice. Most impressive about their lunch even carefully suggesting a glass of wine for paring the food we ordered. Strongly suggest a good place for local and international tourists
4
Had an evening business drink at this pleasant bat. has great gin selections and fantastic decor. Was a very pleasant environment for our discussion and staff were attentive.Did not try any of the foods. No empty seats and table insight. Seems a very popular spot for evening drinks
5
Simply what I've said. Exquisite and faultless from the food to the ambience. Unique and just somewhere that wonderful memories can be made forever
5
I was in Singapore recently for 4 nights and visited here twice I loved it that much - what a gorgeous bar! Amazing gin selection in stunning Art Deco settings with big comfy chairs and booths and really friendly helpful staff....one tip - if you go in the evening there is a dress code (no trainers, shorts etc) so make sure you dress appropriately otherwise you won't get in!!
5
An Art Deco-inspired gem, the Atlas is truly stunning. I visited with friends on a Thursday evening and it was pleasantly filled, not crowded. Sadly I cannot drink gin but I had the cocktail named after Churchill and it was lovely; smoky whisky taste rounded out by dark chocolate. Great for a date night during the week
5
Tuesday night and very busy. We had a five minute wait before being seated at the main bar....stunning interior!! . Best seats in the house as we were taken care of by Roman the Head Barman. Such an amazing experience watching him work and all the while taking time to answer our questions about different gins!!! Attentive and very knowledgable and obviously serious about his craft. Thank you for a guiding us and making our first experience of Atlas so enjoyable....we will be back
5
My wife and I stopped by the Atlas bar after walking past it through the day. Seeing it up close the building outside resembles a building more akin to Gotham City.Inside the bar is decorated to an art deco 1920's style (think Great Gatsby) with the restaurant in the middle and entrances around the side. We mainly stopped off for a few drinks and with myself being a big gin fan I was very happy we visited.We were seated at the bar very quickly and was served also very quickly, staff were very friendly and knowledgeable too. During our first drink one of the staff members (nickname Banana) was very kind and talked us through the gins on their list we discussed my favourite gin (Monkey 47) and she allowed us to go up to the collection and have a close inspection of the 1,100 bottles on display. I got to sample the limited edition Beef cut and Distillers cut of Monkey 47 which are both super limited and also probably the best gin ever. We talked more about the gins back home in Scotland and as the conversation closed she gave us the two rings from the limited bottles as "honeymoon souvenirs" which was a classy touch.Couldn't recommend this place enough for gin lovers
4
Wide selection of interesting cocktails/wine. Not that cheap, around $25-$30 per glass thereabouts.But the best thing here would be the ambience, the decor looks great with comfy seats. Great place to just chill and hang out
5
I have a great tea time with my best friends here. Cup of Rooibos and some appetizers with the reasonable price in the amazing place. The seat need to reserve first because almost tables full. The food quality is good with well trained staffs . The ambience make us comfortable sit inside.
5
Great selection of gin.We tried at least 6 different types.Not cheap but experience is worth the money. Book ahead at least 1 week as reservations are tough
1
We made bookings and later find out when we arrived that, despite being Formula 1, we were pushed out because we did not have long pants. Really disappointing that their failure to advise us and make it absolutely clear, turns out to be a blame on the customer.

We all know that G&Ts have been the rage for the past two years or so. Everybody's drinking it. Everybody's making it. Very few times in my life I have been ahead of the curve, but G&T is my go-to drink since 20 years or so. And I have tasted quite a few. (Unfortunately, I have some trouble remembering quite a few as well, but that's a different story). Back to the matter at hand. Atlas has around 1,100 Gins, displayed in a beautiful, tall, glass tower at one end of the bar. The bar, which looks like it is dated in the 1920s, is actually only 20 years old or so. But, it is absolutely beautiful and stunning. I would actually classify it as the most beautiful bar I have seen in all my travels.That's all great, but the most important thing was the amazing gins, the wonderful tonics and the friendly bar staff (who actually had to climb up stairs to get my favorite gin). I'll be back, next time I'm in S'pore.The only recommendation i'd have, is a one-liner description to the gins. You get a phonebook size Gin menu if you ask for it, but, unless you know them, the names just don't mean anything, so it is difficult to choose.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
2
They only have a nice display of gin bottles. Take a photo, and you can go home. The bartenders seem ok. A waitress dropped my sandwich and returned to the kitchen. And a few minutes later, I saw a food runner boy holding my dish and talking to other staff. Yes, I was starving. Also, hunger was not the best sauce.

Could not enter, they have dress code (???), no shorts! This is formula 1 weekend, people around not dressed up. They claim sent the SMS advising, but not received, as we came from out of country. Not flexible at all. Disappointing, really bad attitude too. Don't deserve a visit

We had been recommended this bar so decided to go for lunch with friends before they flew out. It's a really cool building and amazing bar. We each had 2 options from the set menu for SGD$38. Food was ok - some dishes were good however those that had the pasta and the blow-torched wagyu beef tartare weren't that excited about them.

Having walked past the 'Gotham' building countless times, I've always wanted to have a good reason to have a look at the interior. The Atlas bar looks like it came out from the set of the Great Gatsby, with its décor inspired by the 1920's. Once there, you'll feel transported back in time as you admire the intricate interior and high ceiling. Visited the bar one Friday evening after work. It was fun watching the bartenders work their magic, concocting delicious cocktails while munching on some popcorn which was served as a snack - free flow, I believe, as they kept getting it refilled. A bit more pricey than your normal bars but for the ambience, quality and location, it was worth every penny

Was here for dinner and drinks. Amazed by the service staff - super friendly and very kind.Appetizers and main course was okay for me but their dessert and cocktails are just divine.Although the drinks come at quite the price but for the place and service I think it was worth my money

Lavender game strong; both cocktails $24++ each:Tamara in a Green Bugatti: Modern French gin, lavender tincture, much mint, lemon, sugarThe Aix-en-Provence Martini: French modern gin, French dry Vermouth, herbes-de-provence, lavender& one heck of an addictive popcorn mix (guilty as charged).Great ambience - music isn't too loud, seats are comfortable, service is friendly. No wonder there's always a 30-60 min wait if you don't reserve. So.... Y'all know what to do. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only Long waits without reservations Check your bill before you sig

When you are in Atlas, it seems that you are in a different country. Decor is amazing! I love it. Cocktails are presentable and delicious. It is good to have Atlas in Singapre, I will surely invite my friends there

Came for dinner on a Saturday night towards the end of our honeymoon. The bar is amazing, the interior and vibe is very Great Gatsby-esque. One of the most beautiful restaurants I have been to! Food was exceptional, definitely a must see!!

Love the high ceiling and nice setting. The table assigned to us was too low for comfortable dinning. Food wise, soso. Will return only if i see interesting menu

We had a tough time making reservations on popular time slots (Fri, Sat)... But the wait was worthwhile! We were wowed the moment we step into the building's porch area (interesting sculptures) and love the mysterious feel of the gothic-looking interior.We went on a Saturday evening for dinner and drinks; manage to enjoy this place in both daylight and night time. The food we had was great (love the perfectly cooked steak) and customer service was awesome.It was a fabulous and memorable experience; perfect for our celebratory dinner

Stumbled across this gorgeous building whilst exploring Singapore. I was drawn by the beauty of the architecture and the stunning sculptures around the building. Although the building is not original art deco the architect and interior designer did a superb job. I stayed for a cup of tea and then went back for dinner a few nights later. Wonderful service, the Maitre D' is a lovely young woman from Europe. As I perused the Champagne menu I noticed a bottle for over $190,000. The Maitre D' took me and my companion into the room that it is kept so I could photograph the bottle and history. They actually have 3 bottles. My companion and I had a series of tasting pates that were all excellent and shared two desserts. Mine was a pineapple concoction that was not only delicious by served in style by a young chef. The entire experience was fabulous! My favourite place in Singapore. Also, there was a brilliant exhibition with stunning installation pieces in their Gallery on why Sharks shouldn't be killed. Absolutely fantastic! You can also view the fabulous Dali sculptures in the lobby area. An altogether wonderful experience

Had dinner at Atlas Bar and it is an experience, indeed. The interior and atmosphere are stunning, as is the food - true fine dining experience-presentation, taste, service- all excellent. Must do at least once when in Singapore

Wonderful architecture and atmosphere. It's more leather chairs and quiet rather than a trendy bar. Excellent gin selection which is the real highlight. Great selection for non drinkers as well. On the expensive side with drinks averaging 22++. Didn't eat dinner although the menu looked good. Given it's still quite new I would recommend making a reservation.

On a Saturday night out with friends, we found our way to the world of art deco, Gotham City and a bar that would do Batman proud on his day off after chasing the Joker.The Atlas Bar is in the ground floor of the Parkview Square.It is an amazing interior, all rich in lush dark bronze, reds, ochre and beige green colours.The music is cool jazz and blues.The staff are excellent including the barman whizzing out cocktail after cocktail! The light bar food was very impressive.Not cheap but a great start (or end) to a night

i apologise but, i can express more about the interiors, than the drinks. The interiors is so grand, that I could focus more on that, than the drink in hand. After a long tiring day of sight seeing and shopping, we wanted to just sit in an exclusive place to relax. Atlas Bar was highly recommended in the travel websites, and by a friend.We decided to go there, and we were highly impressed. The only thing was that there was a lingering smell of vomit in the washroom, which was disappointing. nevertheless, a beautiful place to experience while in Singapor
5
WOW... I felt like I went back in time, they just don't make buildings like this anymore.Just spectacular. I did feel like I had stepped into Batman's Gothic home.Our meals were mouth watering and drinks were unique and delicious.The 2 level wall of Gin was something you have to see in person, and the walk around the building and are features out in the courtyard are wonderful, which includes one off pieces from Salvador Dal

I really do not know where to start from... let's start from what "I heard" about the place. Everybody was telling me about the "Gotham-like architecture" and I must say that I was not really getting the meaning, but everything became immeditely clear after sitting at the bar and looking around... W O W !The space is impressive, and the bottle tower as well...As I was here in the late afternoon I started getting some olives and an Atlas Martini (honestly having some doubt about the possibility to improve a great standard as a Martini). The result ? The olives were really good (but for 10S$ even a couple of olives more would have been fine) and the Atlas Martini was amazing...I fully enjoyed the cocktail and after that and some popcorn I asked for a second cocktail. The suggestion from the bartender was a "Bohemian Aperitivo", which is their own twist on the Negroni... just awesome...I cannot say if they are really able to maintain this quality level even during a busy evening, but what I had here were probably the two most interesting drinks I found in the whole Singapore (and I had more than a few!).I really wish Sim, and all the team, the best luck for their future, but with quality luck is probably not really necessary... Thanks for the experience !PS: Average cocktail price, tax incl., 23 S

I was amazed by this bar's interior design. It is so grand and impressive! They said they have more than 1,011 gins here! You can ask them to go see the upper floor where they keep all their gins to, they will assist you. Make sure you go their like 6pm to avoid long queue they said if you want to sit by the bar, they accept only walk-ins. However, the price is a bit too pricey for me tho (personally

Visited Singapore for business and was invited out for dinner. After the dinner we went to this place Atlas, wow, super cool location and for anyone travelling to Singapore a must see. The building is from 1999 but built as a 1920 Gotham / Al Capone look and feel. Everything about this place is amazing, a must do

We visited with our teens on our last afternoon in Singapore, and it was a fitting finale. The architecture and design are stunning. We ordered mocktails and snacks, and everything was served with a warm professionalism that is sometimes missing from up-market venues. My son is a keen photographer, and captured some great shots here. Thanks to your team for a lovely visit.
5
We sat at the bar, which we requested as we wanted the whole experience. It didn't disappoint! Awesome Gin, awesome cocktails...passionate staff that knows their stuff! They have a fine balance between interacting with you while ensuring you have your privacy too. Chatted to other patrons at the bar and honestly just had a great evening and enjoyed some special Gin. I can highly recommend an evening at the Atlas

While it was not my first visit the the Atlas bar at Parkview Square in Singapore, it was my first dining experience there.My companions and I were blown away by the decor and the pure luxury of the beautiful dining/bar area and the best was yet to come.Our waiter arrived with a comprehensive drinks list and a divine dining menu. Our drinks arrived and I can honestly say that I have never had a more enjoyable cocktail.You must experience this for yourself, and don't forget to order the Scandal Water cocktail

This is just an amazing space , it has to be a must go bar for drinks or dinner. Service is polite and fast . Price point up there !! But the scenery and the room is why you to this place. Nicely buzzing with a attractive crowd !! You won't be sorry you came here

Had a nice evening here for drinks with my wife, but it also looks like a great place with colleagues or clients. I had a vodka cocktail that was recommended by the bartender, ended up ordering another one. My wife had a glass of house wine, it was good quality. Great atmosphere, love something different in Singapore! We tried the octopus starter it was very good and I recommend it. A nice start to the evening

Whilst this bar is gorgeous inside and very insta-worthy, there is something missing. The bar is quiet and many sofa's and banquet areas separate the bar from being a social one. What's missing is atmosphere. Great for a look and a drink.

I used to visit this bar when it was a wine bar with virtually no customers. Now it's a 'gin bar' and on everyone's radar and so you need to book a table for drinks. Service is bad.... they clearly need to upgrade that side of things too. We were a large group drinking champagne and cocktails so I understand that takes time but over 30 mins for a gin martini is not acceptable. Either get more staff or train them better... or both. The building is STUNNING though and its worth visiting if only for that

We decided to visit the Atlas Bar and enjoy the art deco bar. The atmosphere is really quite lovely. The service friendly and professional. The cocktails menu to chose from is quite delightful but beware the prices given in the wine/cocktail list do not include the 10% service charge or the 7% GST. Disappointing as this soured an otherwise pleasant experience
5
Went tonight and it was lovely... Best Gin collection and they have a $38 sampler with 3 gin and tonics. The Spanish Rosemarie is seriously stunning. Also got a cheese platter. The building is stunning but I've said that elsewhere about Parkview; this time however was better because of the updates Atlas di

must go if you are in Singapore. they might have the largest collection of Gin in the world over 1000 kinds. be there on Friday then you can climb up to the Gin Tower and staff will introduce their collection to you

We were here in June later the night. Although our reservation got lost we received a table. The decor is fabulous. Oh feels like you are in the 20s. Good Drinks and nice people. Def worth the money.

Think of the delightful Mr Fogg’s Residence in Mayfair, bling it up big-time in an Art Déco-ey way, slap a massive gin tower spang in the middle of it – et violà: you get the idea of Atlas!For those of you feeling flush, the Atlas serves vintage cocktails for S$200 (approx £100) a glass. Entry-level cocktails, however, start at a more modest S$24 (£12) – including the house martini (concocted with London dry gin, ambrato vermouth, orange bitters and a dash of champagne vinegar).The Atlas drinks menu makes the bold claim that ‘gin and gin splashing’ are their great passion, and it shows! These guys know their cocktails – which is unsurprising, given the head bartender is none other than Roman Foltan (formerly of the Artesian at The Langham). The dining menu is not too shabby either – with bar bites that are a work of art in their own right.Definitely a venue to impress the date

Wife's birthday. What a stunning fit out. Brilliant. Service level very impressive. Think really good 5 Star hotel. Food menu limited but we enjoyed what we had. More a bar than somewhere to eat. Not cheap but similar prices to any up market place in SG. Amazing selection of guns. Highly recommend
5
The bar is worth the price of the drinks. The decor is is like a trip back in time and the drinks range from their one-of-a-kind house specialties to the usual cocktails. The menu is limited, but the items are not the run-of -the mill bar foods. The service was impeccable and very professional
5
Wow. What a stunner. This is one of the most spectacular bars you'll ever sit in. Art Deco interiors lift the spirits and encourage you to look up and take in the magnificent ceilings. One of the tallest drinks cabinets ever sits proudly at one end of the seating area, heaven knows how the staff access the top bottles! The staff are polite and friendly and the actual cocktails fantastic. A jo

This was recommend to us by another and he was right, what a place. We went during the afternoon and it was a comfortable visit but it gets very busy during the evening. Businesses only get very busy when they are good at what they do. Don't look at the price if you start doing that stay at home and miss what is enjoyable
5
This is an amazing place on every count.An huge room with over the top art deco and clever lighting is by itself quite extraordinary. The drinks and food are all top of the range.The service is friendly and highly professional. This has to be the single best bar experience in Singapore.It is very popular so do make a reservation.My chicken lollipops with black pepper sauce and a knockout cocktail or two meant I left in a truly happy state.Very special indeed

Atlas Bar has reinvented itself as a fabulous place for gin (and other) cocktails, keeping the same divine interiors, tasty eats and slick service. We went early (6pm) as a group of 7 and the queue to get in was super long by about 7pm. Reservations are totally necessary if you don't want a 45 min+ wait! We had a brilliant time and will be back. Great for meeting friends, corporate clients, or visitors from overseas who want a bit of glitz

A friend had been telling me about this huge wine fridge that's turned into a gin bar and wanted to take me during a visit to Singapore. It would have to be one of the best bars I've been to in Singapore, it's done very tastefully with an amazing Art Deco interior and the gin is quite literally floor to ceiling and I think I could even see a harness to allow the bartenders to get the top shelf!It's very impressive! The food is a bit of a variety so covers light or heavier meals...we had a short wait to get a table so might be worth trying to get a reservation.Good lounge music, good vibes, amazing cocktails and good friendly service!Definitely going back!
