Love their signature Rough love cocktail which packs a strong punch yet easy to drink. Great that it goes on half price too!

I have been visiting CUT at least once/twice a year simply because the steak here is awesome (especially the jap waygu) and the peewee potato (tasty n a must).Would eat at CUT more often but it will burn a big hole in my pocket.Service is good. Steak is done the way you want it. Ambience is cosy
5
I ordered Rib Eye Steak with my cousin here and it was so good! The taste is very delicious. we ate steak with the chef home made source together. I recommended for steak lover come for a visit and try it by yourself! You won't disappoint!!!

This was a business dinner to say thank you in a relaxed way to a supportive client. I was impressed from start to finish. This isn't a cheap experience, but it is an experience. The decor is loud and brash with stripped back portraits of US movie stars. Very striking and in some ways I thought the place had a New York or LA vibe.The prawn "cocktail" starter was incredible - some of the best prawns I have ever eaten and so cleverly put together. I won't ever forget that dish.My main was then possibly one of the best - if not the best - steak I have ever eaten - a delicious American wagyu filet - half the cost of the meal went on the meat, but it was absolutely worth it. Divine.I would very much recommend the sprout and butternut squash sides. All in all, a wonderful experience, good service but food to absolutely die for

We visited cut on 1 January 2018. 1. BookingWe booked a day before, only spots at 17.30 were available; that was ok to us, short term bookings are like that. However, the two hour cut off is not necessarily enforced, we actually stayed three hours in total. That was good. Anyway, tables remained free during our stay, so a slightly later spot would have been possible. That however is no issue for us. 2. Wines We hand a Chateau Neuf du Pape; exquisite handling of wine and went great with the meal. 3. BeefWe visit a number of steak houses everywhere; the wagyu was the best ever. Cooked medium rare to perfection; arrived in perfect condition. 4. SidesThe sides are average; but you don’t really come for the sides. 5. ServiceThe booking went good; the welcoming lady appears to be a bit arrogant, but guess the location serves her right. The table service was really good; everyone knew what they were talking about. The only thing missing maybe is a sommelier. The crowd consists at about 75% of people that just go there because they want to be seen and not for the food. Kids are loud, a lot of yelling was included at a number of tables. Service did not say anything to that, so that is the only downside. I will come back.

I enjoy visiting Celebrity Chef restaurants, see if their food lives up to the hype. This is the third time I have visited a Puck restaurant, and I have loved every one of them. To keep this short and to the point:-The staff was amazing, friendly, helpful in recommendations, treated a single diner with respect, and never gave the impression they would rather be helping a larger table. I can go on and on about the staff. they were excellent.  - The steak was one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life. New York cut Idaho Wagyu, as recommended by the waiter. Absolutely perfectly prepared. Great seasoning, no sauce needed.- Side of Brussel sprouts were perfect with the steak. Also recommended by the waiter. - Soufflé dessert went great with some Brandy and really was a perfect ending to the meal. Everything in this restaurant was amazing and contributed to a wonderful night. if I had to find criticism, it would be overpriced scotch. But in reality, that is to be expected in this location and for this quality of restaurant. It was an expensive meal, however, half was for wine and booze, and still... Worth every penny!I will definitely be back soon with my family to share this experience
5
We have dined here several times and each time found the taste and quality shows up on the plate and reflects daily high standards and farmers market buys . The produce tastes like its fresh from my childhood garden . I have requested special dietary changes and the staff/chef were fantastic
5
A really enjoyable evening with very good service and ambience. Everything was superb from the bread to the awesome deserts. The star of the show is without doubt the steak that was simply amazing, cooked to perfection and with mouth watering side dishes and sauces. It’s not cheap but nonetheless less for the quality I think offers value for money. Would definitely go back
5
Food was tasty and plentiful. Service was outstanding. Unfortunately there was a monsoon the night I visited and they saw me shivering. I also had flu that night and was sensitive to the cold. To keep me warm, they brought me hot water and kept me topped up and turned the air con off. They also advised us on food selections and made sure we didn't over order. They made up a dessert plate for my birthday which was a lovely touch. I can't thank the entire team enough for such a pleasant experience. Thank you.
5
Thus is our second consecutive time celebrating our wedding anniversary at CUT on the actual day and it was fabulous again!Really appreciated the warm service from Marilou which made us feel at ease and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner! Food was great as usual and the cocktail named Rough Love is surprisingly delicious.Looking forward to Dec 2018
5
Very nice restaurant at the marina bay sands shopping mall. Great stake and deserts. The kobe stake is divine.
5
Was worried about eating in a mall but that was over as soon as we got in. Perfect food and the sauces were to die for and place was buzzing 10pm on a Monday. Expensive but my taste buds are still in love.
5
This is an fine dining establishment. Great atmosphere. Modern european cuisine. Not cheap but not over the top. Excellent standard cuisine and efficient friendly service.
5
Celebrated our wedding anniversary with a lovely dinner at CUT a few weeks ago and we have only the best impressions of the restaurant, the food and especially the staff! Husband had steak (of course) and I had the baby chicken (not into beef) which turned out to be an entire chicken rotisserie-cooked to perfection. The appetisers - Hokkaido scallop carpaccio & maple glazed pork belly - were a knockout, too. Aside from the outstanding food, we also loved the intimate (and upscale) feel of the restaurant. Above all, the very friendly and accommodating staff help to complete the fabulous dining experience
1
Being fans of Spago and a steak we were looking forward to Cut but unfortunately it was a large extremely expensive disappointment. The apple salad was nice. The meat is well cooked but our compliments end there. The meat was extremely over priced. The sides we had with our mains were tasteless. The broccolni was edible but tasteless. The peewee potatoes described as baby potatoes with garlic and I think aioli was over cooked soggy halved potatoes soaked in alibi and what I think was fried garlic. It was horrible. The butternut squash just tasted like over boiled butternut squash. The ,Mac n cheese’ which admittably we have not eaten before for was congealed pasta in white sauce. The staff were trying but not up to this price point for example not sure where wines came from and condescending. We left after the marinas the food was so bad so we could have dessert elsewhere. At over $1000 without dessert There are many better places to spend your mone
5
Celebrated my 1st wedding anniversary there. The service and the food was exellent. The staff had good product knowledge and knowing that it was our first time there, explained the menu before we placed our order. Throughout our dinner the staff would come over to make sure that everything was alright. I thought that the words "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the rim of the plate our soufflé was on was a nice personal touch. We will definitely go back again.

We are fine dining a lot and can distinguish between real good service and pretending to do so.As we are fron Austria, we wanted to give Wolfgang a visit, which was unfortunately not very satisfying.Unappropriate loud music, chosen steak not available anymore, wine prices which are out of this world (we know how much they cost in Austria), a place right at the kitchen where waiters are permanently walking by as in a trainstation.We have been to many places, but this was by far one of the worst experience ever.Disapointing Wolfgang
5
I was deeply touched when a steak house like CUT respected the culinary requirement of a vegan like me. The roasted pumpkin with fried shallots and curry leaves with a light touch of nuts was appetising and filling at the same time.The vegan bread and olive oil too was good.The waiters were perceptive and warm.Thanks grace and zuzu( hope Iam getting the names right)And the Vegan desert at the end truly took the cake.The topping on the ice cream , was when the Chef took out time from his busy schedule to personally come n meet me.It was an experience that I will always cherish.Keep it up guys We need more of , such places which are perceptive to the different culinary preferences within one family.Truly a CUT above the rest.A BIG THANKYOU.... to all who played their part in front and behind the scene
5
We had our wedding anniversary celebration at the restaurant and we did not regret our decision. Food was great and service was attentive but not intrusive. Good food recommendation by Angeline. She has good product knowledge, able to communicate with us in a friendly and polite manner. LM, a service staff from Myanmar, was another asset to the restaurant. He is able to make short conversation in a jovial and friendly manner. Overall, it's a great place to dine in.

Let's face it, getting a great steak in SE Asia is a challenge. Thought I'd do well here based on the reviews, but the search goes on. Paying $92 Sing dollars (about $70 US) for a Prime NY (and another 5 for sauce) resulted in a steak on par with....Sizzler. OK...maybe Black Angus. "Potato Puree" (mashed potatoes) at $18 were good, but the portion was sure small. The Brussel sprouts were numerous, but were largely left uneaten by those at the table--the bitterness was not teased out at all by the chef. Other sides and the salad were good. A shot of alcohol will set you back $24 Sing, and you're paying to admire the cut glass, 'cuz the bar isn't exactly generous with the portion. I moved this to three stars as my table mates enjoyed their steaks better than I, tho' I doubt any of us will return. This place is for the high rollers, dollars be damned set--but its a pretty average food experience for a high price IMHO. Perhaps the $200+ cuts are out of this world, but you won't catch me paying that for a chunk of meat
5
I've been to Cut couple of times and the service are always consistently great. The food are dynamite and the ambience are splendid. I would always love to come back, Just smelling the dish are already tempting and the taste are very mouth watering.
5
Its one of my favorites,a great place to go and relax with excellent staff and service second to none.
From the warm little scones, Pork Belly,The whole Chicken and the Steak with fries,you will leave very happy.
5
Cut is worth every cent, it’s quite pricey (like all fine dining in Singapore, but you don’t feel robbed) but definitely reflected in the ingredient’s quality. Not only meat, try the carpaccio scallops to understand what I mean.
5
Very good meat! Perhaps best in SG, yes its expensive but quality is very good. My dinner for 2 pax + bottle of wine around $700. Good staff, service and food. Recommend for business, special occasions, couples.
5
The setting of CUT seemed strange as we walked through Marina Bay shops to get there but once we arrived it was a world apart. Nice welcome and table was ready on time and as a little early we have drinks at the bar before being showed to table.Cheese sticks and bread lovely, service for us was exceptional and attentive.Both had wagyu fillet mignon which was stunning! Great food and atmosphere
5
My Singapore-based son is a regular here (ironic as he's a vegetarian) so the staff made a great welcome for him as the four of us arrived. This was an early-evening meal prior to the premiere of "West Side Story" in the adjacent theatre. The main dining area was screened off which I appreciated as I find the huge mirrored wall quite dazzling and distracting.My last review of Cut was three years ago. Meals were the usual high standard and drinks to match
4
Went with a couple of more friends to the Cut by WP. The ladies at the reception are quite a lot and quite flattering but lack that sophistication.General Manager came to meet us and was very pleasant and we had a good conversation with him and did suggest a couple of very nice items in the menu. Nice touch.The starters were really good, steaks were nicely done and well placed. We went for whoâ€™s your daddy which was quite a Daddy! Thoroughly enjoyed that oneAmbience was nice and the show was managed well given that it was pretty busy.Thanks for looking after us

CUT has one of the nicest bars in Singapore. The mixologist are doing an amazing job. The signature meal is of course meat, which they do very well. However, at my last meal there, I ordered hand-cut fries. They come @ SGD18++ per portion, so I naturally exerted them to be at the same level as the meat. How disappointing. The fries where fluffy, unsalted and simply smashed in a bowl. Not up to the standard of CUT . . .Alos, the service - beside the barman - is quite mechanical and impersonal. Even if you arrive early and the bar is literally empty, the ladies at the reception (and there are several of them standing around) keep you waiting and tell you "let's see what we can do for you" . . . quite a bit of unnecessary attitude . .

We were seated in a semi private enclave with just a single table at one corner of the dining room. I honestly don't know what to make of the decor except that it struck me as rather clinical, unlike that of Peter Luger Steak House in New York, which had a cosy and inviting feel to it.Maple Glazed Pork Belly, Fuji Apple-Yali Pear Salad, Sesame-Orange Dressing - This looked absolutely delicious with a sumptous fat to meat ratio of ~50%. Coupled with a rich layer of sweet maple glaze, it was a sure fire recipe for nausea. Thank god for the sliced apple and pear salad, though sweet, provided a nice refreshing crunch and much needed moisture. I personally think a tarter apple, ie. Granny Smith's, would work better though. Double Thick Iberico Pork Chop, Rhubarb "Moustarda" - I liked how the surface of the pork chop was crisp (a wee bit to burnt though) while the meat (and fat) retained its tenderness and flavour. The meat was also well seasoned with a faint tartness (probably from the rhubarb). Decent but not as good as Gunther's rendition. Hokkaido "Snow", Tomakomai, Filet Mignon - I had high hopes for this small piece (120g) of premium Japanese steak (heck you would too if it cost $245++) but unfortunately it was disappointing to say the least. Although the marbling was very good, the meat was a little too soft for my liking at medium doneness and it lacked the beefiness that I personally like. Kaya Baked Alaska - Ironically, the Kaya Baked Alaska was the star of the evening. Reminiscent of a durian shell with its spiky edges, this dessert was essentially coconut cake with pandan ice cream and coconut sorbet encapsulated within a meringue on a crumble base and quickly torched. Deliciously sweet and I love how all the flavours come together to remind me of Kaya. Served with a "side" of coffee crumble. The both of us spent ~$508 for a rather dissatisfying dinner. Service was good but food in general wasn't great and I fail to see how or why CUT was awarded a Michelin star
5
The restaurant was marvelous with nice cozy ambience. The wagyu tenderloin was cooked to perfection and really paired well with the pan-seared foie gras. I really like the quality of the meat/ ingredients they used. I would definitely return to the restaurant when I visit Singapore again
5
We were here two years ago and rated five stars, this time around was just as good.
Great steak, sides, sauces and not the least wine list.
We will be back. Still at top five steakhouse (worldwide) for me!
5
Wow what a place to eat. My wife and I went with two children 8 / 10. It was a great experience and the food was amazing.
5
Great steak nice atmosphere . Will definitely be back...service top notch
and verry friendly( thx mr. Marilou raj -Lm)
❤️❤️❤️
5
Positives:
- upmarket and refined atmosphere
- efficient but also jovial service
- perfectly cooked steak
Negatives:
- quite high price (but worth it for quality)
5
my fav place and my to go to steak house whenever i have cravings for steak. had my first The Cut experience in vegas and I have to say, the standard in spore is the same. perfectly cooked steak, fantastic beef carpacio, superb ambience for date night and great service
4
Great food and wine! More expensive than usual , that is to be expected as Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world right now.The place would've been better if it was not located in a mall. However, this is the norm for Singapore. Ambient lighting, nice crowd and great food
5
We had a wonderful time at Cut! For mains, we got the Australian wagyu, a wagyu sampler with kale and brussels sprout as our sides. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the service was top notch. Would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu

Actually, to put that title into context, it's the best steak I've had in Singapore, and comes a close second to my favourite in Bangkok - but that's another story as the saying goes. 'Cut' has a great food selection with an informative menu and the staff were only too happy to help explain the details; and what they promised arrived :) My colleague had the 3-steak selection, and I a rib-eye. Perfectly cooked, our medium-rare steaks were nicely seared outside to give a little 'bite' but warm and red inside. The side dishes were top-notch too, I liked the egg with the spinach that was broken and mixed in at the table.A somelier was on hand to help us pair the food with wine from an enormous list; a little daunting actually and I wonder if it needs to be so big.Unbelievably, but probably because the meal was so well-balanced, we managed dessert, which was excellent also.The only minus point that prevent a 5* rating from me is the layout of the restaurant. It looks like what it is - a box unit in a shopping mall. In another life it could have been a shoe shop. It looks like they have simply laid out as many tables as they can fit in to the space, whereas I think that more imaginative interior-design could have come up with a more interesting plan.I've left the best to last, however, and that is the staff. We were held in traffic and only just met the 15-minute deadline for our reservation, and the restaurant was full. However the host showed us to the bar for some superb cocktails. Throughout the meal Harry Loh, and his colleagues Sam and Raj kept us informed, fed and watered, and entertained. Clearly well trained and motivated the staff put a polish on the whole experience. Well done
5
After having cocktails @ bar of Spargo on the 57th floor of the Sands Marina Bay, we went to Cut by Wolfgang Puck, s steakhouse serving some of the most delicious, tender and tasty beef I've ever had. The ambience, waitstaff service and booth we had for the evening was outstanding. Every detail of service was provided by as many as the four different staff including the sommelier who provided expert assistance on the wine choices. Our meal, dessert and wine service was perfect. To top off the evening, somehow they discovered it was my b-day and they provided a delightful "dessert sentiment" for the occasion from the waitstaff. This establishment does cater to your every need. A MUST VISIT when in Singapore for delicious food, perfect service and a great experience. The best b-day celebration ever
2
It wasn't peak hours and we were the only ones around when we arrived and made our orders but the Japanese Ribeye steak+Foie Gras, US Wagyu steak and Kurobuta took more than 50mins to come even though I was told the food would be served in 30-40 mins. You might say what's the big deal about 10mins? Well, it was a big deal to us as we waited longer than expected but was then served with a rather dry US Wagyu and a pretty burnt Jap Ribeye steak on the outside. We have visited numerous reputable steak houses in Singapore and overseas but never experienced something as bad as this. To be polite, we didn't want to make a fuss over the poorly cooked steaks when we were asked. The Kurobuta and the foie gras were pretty well done on contrary. It was really a long wait, however, your servers were stingy with the bread. Come on, we are paying a bill in excess of $700 and you couldn't spare us some more bread to tide us over the hunger? My folk did not really like the taste of bottled water and we asked for just the normal ice water, however, we were charged for the Fiji bottled water at the end of meal. It is not about the money but the service quality and professionalism. Sorry to say, Cut by Wolfgang Puck has failed in the service quality, food consistency and serving time. And it looked like the chef was rushing his orders, the steaks do not even come with any sides? Not even some greens? Nothing at all. I will let the pictures do the talking. Definitely failed to make the cut.
5
We stayed at Marina Bay Sands. Had decided to have a special meal for our last night. We chose well. Cut was excellent. The food was very good whilst the service was spectacular. Expensive but worth it.
5
Everything great, bread, butter, wine and service. Awesome steak and correct staff.
Thank u for this experience.
5
Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday today at CUT and was not disappointed. Marilou took good care of us right from the beginning and recommended some dishes to us to try. LM and Nickson made sure we were always satisfied and ensured our water was always topped up! LM even offered to pack my leftover meat for me to take home which I found to be such a sweet gesture and even gave us some sweet treats to end the night! Overall, a wonderful experience made better by these three lovely staff. Coming from the F&B industry myself, i can vouch that it's hard to find such attentive and passionate staff as these three! Food was excellent as always and definitely one on our list to keep coming back to
4
Awesome food! Not to mention the cocktails at bar, tried a couple new (for me) and are fantastic (Wild Love and Looking for Love :-)). Only thing, be aware service is slow, took an hour and half to get steaks. But once we got them, omg, awesome
5
My husband & I came here on our first night at Marina Bay Sands. Staff were great and very attentive. Food was delicious - expensive but worth it. Yummy complimentary breads to start with too. Pork belly entree was very tasty. We had a main dish each and one side to share - that was more than enough (the sides were a good size) - which meant no room for dessert
4
Once you stepped in, you will be greeted by a host and directed to a table assigned to you. An introduction of the various meat available and pairing of wine by the staff was professionally done. I was impressed by the knowledge the staff had.we (2 of us) had an appetizer each and was served with a variety of breads. I personally prefer the olive bread, which was flavorful and soft. The steak and pork we had were huge portion! Taste was extremely good as well. Worth every penny
5
Every trip to Cut has been nothing but amazing. I made a reservation for my wedding anniversary last week and left a comment, wanting a quieter place. When I arrived, they brought me to a booth and I was pleasantly surprised. We were served by Mary and a guy (presumably Singaporean Chinese, I'm sorry I forgot to note his name down) and their service were impeccable. Mary was very bubbly and cheerful and she made me feel at home.The cocktails are excellent! Samurai Sword, Help Save the Bees and Rolling Fog over Mt Fuji are my personal favourites. $26 each but potent and worth every drop.For starters, we had the Alaskan King Crab & Shrimp "louis" cocktail. They kindly plated it for us. I had the NY Sirloin while my partner had the Baby Chicken and it was top notch. The Sirloin may look dry but it was juicy and flavourful on the inside. We had the Yukon Gold Potato Puree and it was the softest and smoothest potatoes ever.Knowing that it was our wedding anniversary, Mary gifted us with a dessert. Thank you for the nice personal touch

We were a party of four that showed up to Cut on a Friday night,didn't expect to get a table but upon calling was told to turn up anyway..Our friends who have been there before reckoned that it was the Best Steakhouse in town.We were told that there wasn't a table available(as expected) but there would be one available in half an hour.The lovely Russian lady at the front of the restaurant was professional and accommodating however we couldn't say the same of her Asian counterpart who looked very annoyed when our fifth guest showed up and we had to change our request from four to five guests.We stood around the Bar whilst we waited for our table and asked to try the Tempranillo Bodegas Izadi – "Crianza", Rioja, Spain 2012 and Shiraz | Torbreck – "Woodcutter's", Barossa Valley, Australia 2015.We then decided on a bottle of the Tempranillo and unfortunately,it wasn't the same as the one that we had sampled.This one tasted a little sour and not as rich as the first one but we drank it anyway.When we were seated,we decided on a $175 bottle of Shiraz and that did not disappoint!We then ordered the Double Thick Iberico Pork Chop, Rhubarb “Moustarda and that was succulent,beautifully flavoured and in short,delicious!The waiter with the bread wasn't the friendliest and i don't think he ever smiled throughout our time there.The onion focaccia paired with the herb butter was divine.The Porterhouse steak for two was over done and according to my friends who have had it before,it didn't taste "right"I didn't care much for Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg BUT the Butter Lettuce, Avocado, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette was light and gorgeous!The restaurant was busy and that could account for the lack of attention that we got from our waiters.We had to ask for our wine and water to be topped up,not what i would expect from a Michelin Star restaurant.However,when our waiter asked if we liked the steak and we said no,he got his manager to come to see us and he did take it off our bill at the end.He didn't say that he was going to do it but it was a nice gesture on his part and fitting for the type of restaurant that we were in.All in all,i was expecting so much more and only got average.It is Overrated and underwhelming in my opinion
5
My wife and I have always had splendid dining experiences at Cut.However, after Cut won its Michelin star, my wife and I had some reservations about a return visit. In our experience, a star or two leads to increased patronage which too often leads to a deterioration of standards. For example, if the kitchen cannot cope with the higher volume of orders.Yet, such fears were completely allayed during a recent visit my wife and I made to the restaurant.As always, the food was impeccable. The missus and I had the Tasting of New York Sirloin platter, which I heartily recommend for the diversity of flavours over ordering a single steak. Even now, several days after our meal, I still dream of the delectable Saga Prefecture cut. For sides, my wife and I had the Peewee Potatoes. Generously buttered, they were an oh-so-sinful treat that we preferred to the usual french fries at other steak restaurants. The Sauteed Broccolini were also delightful. We ended the evening with the Kaya Baked Alaska. As a Hainanese boy, I really enjoyed the infusion of kaya and coconut sorbet into what is otherwise traditionally a Western dessert.The drinks, as prepared by Jan, were beautifully executed. Besides wine, I had a dry Martini and the Smoke & Mirrors. The latter was a fantastic, smoky cocktail that really hit the spot after a long day at the office. At the same time, the stars alongside the food are the wonderful service team led by Paul Joseph. One of Paul's ever-attentive servers is Marilou, who was spot-on with her food and drink recommendations. Tell her your preferences and allergies, and then order all that Marilou recommends. There is no easier way to a hearty feast. Every now and then, Paul will go round the restaurant, regaling diners with entertaining anecdotes. On learning that my wife and I were celebrating a milestone, Paul took the initiative of organising a small surprise for us. It is in such levels of service that, in my view, set Cut far above the rest
4
Five of us dinner at Cut. The steaks stood up to their reputation. We tried a whiskey based cocktail called samurai sword and was worth the $20 we paid for each glass. The service was attentive and friendly. A bottle of wine, two steals, two fish and four whiskey sets us back by about $600. But was worth every cent.
5
A lovely meal with excellent food and wine - who could ask for more! There was a bit of a problem with our reservation confirmation but we were easily accommodated. Now we will have to book the Beverly Hills location and compare!

It was our second time to Wolfgang for our monthsary celebration. The first visit to this restaurant for my partner's birthday a few years back, was simply amazing with very attentive, personalised and warm service by the server and the steak was magnificent and tender. The second time there, we were seated at a brighter area as compared to the previous time. The service was less attentive and we had to signal to call the servers at a few occasions. The server that shared with us on the different types of steaks available, appeared to be slightly reluctant and did not provide much insight about the steaks as we would have expected. The quality of the food was worth the price though the steak we had (porterhouse) was just okay, nothing special. Nonetheless, we appreciate the desserts that they prepared as a gesture of goodwill to celebrate our anniversary. We would recommend this restaurant for celebration of special occasion though probably the service and quality of steaks are either a hit or miss
3
The steaks are ok, I cannot say the same with the Lobsters, They serve it with butter sauce but basically it taste bland, wine selection is good, regarding price, not bad for the steak but personally, I'd stay away from the lobsters. oh, you should order the baby mussels!
2
Made a reservation to celebrate my wife's Birthday. They gave us a very unfriendly email reply saying:"we could only help to write a wording and place a candle on whatever dessert your wife will be ordering. Unfortunately we DO NOT HAVE ANY COMPLIMENTARY CAKE OR DESSERT."Wanted to bring a bottle, asked them on corkage charge. They replied: "guests are NOT ALLOWED to bring outside food and beverages within the restaurant". Arrived on time for dinner because their email stated very clearly if we were late by 15 minutes, they would give the table away. However, they claimed they were behind schedule and the table was not ready, asked us to come back later. Requested for 2 chairs to sit and wait as I (66 years old man) was tired to walk around, the answer was negative. So we stood at a corner to wait.After we got in, we found the place to be terribly noisy. It was definitely worse than a normal Singapore hawker Center. Can't enjoy dinning in such an expensive restaurant with such noise. Food was ok but meat is meat, they would not give me a bean more to go with it.Unless they change, I don't think I will come back
5
Took my girlfriend to Cut by Wolfgang Puck on 3 Aug evening. It was my girlfriends birthday. The aged steaks were fantastic. We also had the marinated pork which was cooked to perfection. Portion sizes were just right. Good service. The staff even gave us a dessert with birthday candles, which made gf very happy. Special thanks to Marilou and Ryan for great service
5
I had dinner with friends here last night. The ambiance is fanstastic. The waitstaffs are pleasant and very accommodating. Kudos to Angeline (our main waitstaff for that night) for being so attentive and helpful, and all her food recommendations hit out tastebuds spot on. The food is excellent. Good presentation and taste is to die for. The steak? The best that I have ever eaten so far... Would definitely dine again in Cut
5
Is it good? Yes!! Is the steak good? They are great!! Is it expensive? Hell Yes! Is it worth it? Yes it is. Been there several times for business and also with my vegetarian Wife to eat at the Cut. Yes it's plenty to eat as well for vegetarian. The steak selection is good and I would wish they would have the Argentinian beef as well but for now USDA or Wagyu steaks. Ambiance and vibe is always good there so indeed is one of the better place to fix your appetite of meat. It has branches around the globe and quality is good!
5
I came here with a few friends from work not really knowing what to expect. Once arrived the vibe and ambience of the place was unreal. You wouldn't think you had just walked in off a shopping mall strip. Steaks are not cheap and possibly the most expensive you will ever find but we'll worth it and ended up finishing my meal thinking it was all worth it. If you have cash to splash and want an awesome steak try this place. Remember to book early.
5
Been to Cut about 4 times in the past. Usually to celebrate my father in law's birthday. Impressed by the service and the fact that the team were attentive to my daughter's food allergy needs! Would have expected and liked a quieter environment. It's difficult to entertain a good conversation here. Other than this, Cut brings together excellent food, service and a dining experience that if you have extra cash is potentially worth paying for
1
What could I say! Tables are set like in a office canteen and close together, bad acoustics and noisy, poor food quality, steak is quite ordinary and basic. Need all the extra orders to make a complete steak dinner etc. It's first and the last time that I will be cut at that ridiculous pricing.

Great food. Starters of veal tongue and tuna tartare was delicious. Good quality steak. And fantastic service by Marilou, Ryan and Steven. They were attentive throughout. Thank you for the wonderful evening!
5
Just amazing food! Wait staff was superb, food was out of bounds and the atmosphere was chic. Extremely expensive, but way worth it! We spare no expense when it comes to eating well!
5
Cut has a lot against it; located inside an enormous mall, so-so decoration...
However when it comes to food it is hard to beat, The selection of meat cuts is amazing and the cooking method made me have the best steak ever.
5
I consider myself a foodie as enjoy eating and drinking, the quality of the meat in this place is superior, we take the Australian Angus Bone Filet Mignon and its was great in its term, soft and tastyThe starters probably are not their strong as are probably to small, the desserts in my case the soufflÃ© a ten and the coconut one probably the worst of our dinnerOf course it's a expensive place we paid 900 Singapur dollars,( with a Champagne bottle

My friend and I booked dinner here as we wanted a special way to end the short getaway we had taken for my birthday. From the moment we entered the restaurant we could not fault the service, the bar staff were lovely, informative and made perfectly mixed Cocktails (I had the "Brace for Impact" and it was delicious) For our meal we shared the pork belly entree and the kitchen very accommodatingly split one serve onto two individual and beautifully presented plates. The meat was perfectly cooked and incredibly tasty. For mains I had a steak and my friend the chicken with 2 sides to share and honestly not a single thing could be faulted - My steak was perfectly cooked with a gorgeous char/smoke ring, one of if not the best steaks I have ever eaten.For dessert we shared the chocolate souffle, presented with a candle and happy birthday message for myself - the staff adorably sung me happy birthday and the souffle itself was perfection, a truly blissful experience.Our staff - Marilou, Nok and Harry - made our night, they were faultlessly polite, informative and charismatic. They were lovely, happy and honestly hilarious - having a good laugh with us more than once during the evening. They honestly went above and beyond for us even when we were the only two people left in the restaurant (and it was very late)All in all dining at CUT is an expensive experience (but there are far more expensive ones out there) however it is one of the most worthwhile splurges I have ever had. I have raved about this experience to my friends home in Australia and I cannot wait for my next trip to Singapore so I can go back again!

Had a great evening at this classy restaurant with perfectly cooked steaks paired with some delicious wines. The service was good and prompt with attention to detail. Although quite pricy but worth the spend as food overall is excellent. The only negative was that we had to wait for our table even though we were on time but we sat at the bar with some G and Ts and the wait was for 10 min or so.
3
So I was there for family dinner. Everyone there are very helpful, and nice. The appetizers were great! The only thing I believed supposed to be improve is their steak. I was there for steak, but I think somewhere else serves better steak at lower price compare to CUT. I've been a huge fans of CUT since I was in Los Angeles. I was so happy when they announced they are opening in Singapore. But, Singapore's CUT still has a lot to improve
5
We were looking forward to this experience. Well, it turned out wonderful even though I have to admit that the steak was not that impressive. The restaurant was quite busy with a lot of guest in a saturday evening. We got a table for 3 in this "private box". The service was excellent, very professional, quick, attentive, friendly. The food was good, not great. The Prime Ribeye, the lamb chops were a bit over marinated so it took a bit of its original taste and flavor away from the meat. If it were some lower class steakhouse, it would be considered excellent steak; however, for the class of this restaurant, over adding ingredients could be considered as a "minus". As for the wine, we only ordered glass but they served as if we ordered bottle. Quite impressive with this "treatment". Normally, the restaurant just bring out the glasses for you. Here, they bring out the whole new bottle, show it to you, chill it (white wine, chardonay) to the point we wanted and serve the wine. Same thing as for red wine without the chilling. Well, we love the dinner, definitely come back
5
We had the pleasure of dining at Cut and were highly impressed. From the professionalism of the front desk team to their waiting staff, the night was perfect. We were given advice of the choice of meat, including a visual display - even the explanation on the preferred serving was appreciated. The meat arrived cooked to perfection! There's a great and yummy selection of sides, and the desserts are to die for!!! Great selection of wines also. The ambience was relaxing and the service attentive. Thanks to Harry, Nok and Nickson!
5
Wow. Everything from the service, ambience and of course the food was exceptional. The staff were friendly and extremely professional. I had one of the best meals I have ever eaten. The sides were divine and the presentation and attention to detail was worth every cent. Special
5
Went to Cut with my bf for our anniversary. Food is extremely good! Big thank you to Lau Merng for the recommendation and good service. I love the big eye tuna tartare so much. Steak is also delicious. Was an extremely satisfying dinner.
5
Highly recommended, food is great, location is just to Master Card Theater in side shopping mall. Price are on level of SG.
5
Absolutely deserving of its 1 Michelin star - lovely, unpretentious place, best steak in town, fab service. Our captain was Mary and she was lovely and attentive. Definitely coming back again!
4
The restaurant is beautiful and a place to be seen. I had the fillet which was good but definitely not as mind blowing as I would have hoped. It did not compare to the fillet at Mortons.However, the experience was fabulous and it's worth a visit if you have some $$ left after visiting the shoppes. Fantastic venue for a date

Cut by wolfgang puck. Anyone willing to drop by would definitely be one that would be willing to pay for delicious steak. Good quality, tender, succulent piece of steak. If you're looking at just that, then you will definitely not be disappointed. The steak was absolutely delicious. Then you may wonder the 3 star rating. That's because my steak wasn't cooked evenly. There were parts that were rare, there were parts that were medium and a small portion is medium rare (to which I ordered). When I checked with the staff, the lack the attitude to serve was rather obvious. The lack of knowledge to get out of the situation was prominent. It's rather disappointing to be paying so much, sitting in a restaurant with 1 Michelin star with the staff not knowing their product. I am not asking for a new piece but I was just trying to learn something as well but sadly it didn't turn out my way. 1 of the piece was close to raw. Another plus would be the mac and cheese, absolutely delicious. If you love steak, you must try it at Cut. Everyone else are just way overpriced
3
With a business group. Steak was good - as you would expect. However choice of entrees was limited. Main problem was service. For some reason our table was not shown the display of meat cuts that we saw every other table receive and on several occasions when wanting service we had to try and hail staff and often had quite a wait. Not really good enough for the price and a Michelin starred restaurant. So many choices in Singapore they will need to lift their game. Desert soufflÃ© also had an unusual (not good) taste as noted by more than one in our group
4
Good steak restaurant with friendly service. The tenderloin with the side dishes were all good. The service was friendly and quick. The wines were a little expensive even for Singapore standards. I am not a big fan of restaurants in a mall but once you're in the restaurant you don't notice it at all.
5
You can never be disappointed in the service of this place. Having visited NYC and Bahrain and booking a vacation in Singapore, this was the top priority on our list. The quality of food or drinks that you order is unquestionable. Everything is cooked to perfection. We've tried the local specials as well as the traditional sliders. And of course we had to order from the handcrafted cocktails. The design is gorgeous and the atmosphere is very trendy. Have a seat before your dinner at the bar and see the bartenders in action! Many thanks to the chef and the service team for making our night special.
5
Everything served on the table was mind blowing including the welcome breads. Every detail is made to perfection. The steak and sides was massive and taste really on point! One of my best steak dinner of all time. Too bad that we couldnt finish the side dishes as they were in big portion. I just realised thats why some tables have them for sharing but we just realised it a bit later. And too bad because we were too full, we couldn't try any of the dessert. Maybe next time!Overall we had a really great dinner at Cut
4
The price of the steaks are on the high side. The serving size is good, however the taste is not as great given for the price we are paying. Other than that, the rests are great. The moscato and the red wine tasted excellent. One of the best we had. The complementary pastries tasted delicious and the service is of class
5
What an amazing meal! Everything was terrific! I had the New York Sirloin and Macaroni and Cheese and they were cooked perfectly. The onion rings are just as amazing!
The service was the best as well.
4
I had dinner one evening and is a very nice ambience. I ate on the tables by the bar as the restaurant was full. Good service and food, the only down is the acustic, very noisy but good vibe with the people.
5
Probably the best meal I have ever had. Fantastic and knowledgeable staff, (expensive, but still) value for money, but most of all amazing food. Steak was perfect, sauce gorgeous and the sides were to die for.
5
My partner and I book a table to celebrate our 4 year anniversary on Friday the 9th of June. Everything on the night was amazing. The food was delicious, the atmospher wonderful and the service was exceptional. Special thanks to LM and Marilou who made our night superb. We were shown the different cuts of meat, recommend wine to pair with our mains and overall just had a wonderful time. We had the Mapel Glazed Pork Belly for starters followed by the 395g Rib Eye Steak and the Tasting of New York Sirloin for mains. Make sure you order the Red Wine Bordelaise sauce if you order a singular steaks. Whilst the price was a little steep. It was a fantastic night. But we I really must commend our servers. LM and Marilou were exceptional and it's service like that which makes the cost 100% worth it
4
We had dinner for two at the restaurant, very very fast service after ordering. Pre-pepared starters came straight after ordering them. Literally. Main course took a little longer and was cooked to order - meaning the meat had the right cooking grade. Sides are large and quality of sides and sauces is high. Meat quality is good and overall this is a safe bet if you want top have a good piece of steak
5
I travel for business frequently, and therefore eat out frequently. There are very few places I dine at that provide the level of personalized service like Cut has. I was warmly greeted upon arrival and promptly taken to my seat. I was warmly attended to throughout my meal, being personally greeted by the general manager as well. I went for the USDA Sirloin, which was absolutely delightful - full of flavor, juicy, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Tip: ask for the pretzel bread to go with your food. It is incredible. Would I come back? Absolutely. Highly recommende
5
Wow. Everything was great, I don't know where to start. The steak was perfect - juicy and medium well, just how I like it. I chose the peppercorn sauce which went really well with the meat. The sides we ordered, mac & cheese and fries, were delicious! And the servings were quite large too. They have an extensive drinks and wine list and we love sweet wine so we ordered a bottle of moscato to round out our meal nicely. The service was fantastic, the personnel were very knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks, they were attentive but not intrusive, and they seemed to anticipate our needs. Oh and they gave us a bread basket and some butter, the pretzel was really good. As expected, the meal was pricey but oh so worth it. I will definitely go back and recommend to my family and friends
5
The food was good as expected let's get that out of the way.The sirloin tasting plate superbly charred and beautifully pink on the inside. The marrow side rich and succulent.. Like little melty morsels of scallops. Creamed spinach and peewee potatoes were house favorites n fragrant. Touch more smokiness to the terrine and it wlda been perfect. Now, the staff. From the front, to the bus boy, to Rocquel who took care of us that evening. Accommodating and make our date.
5
The team of Angeline, LM and Nickson provided excellent service. I just needed to subtly highlight it's my friends birthday and the surprised us with ice cream cake and waffles on the house. I am also on a wheelchair and they found us the most comfortable seating arrangement during a busy night. Kudos to the chef for the succulent chicken and pea soup that made the night all so perfec
5
Returned to CUT and requested for the same table. Granted that and most of the staffs still remembers us! Once again, served by Sam, Jeremy and Naga - They were lovely! Sam's the best!& really, other than steaks, the Baby Chicken is worth having!Try this: "Baby Chicken Cooked On Rotisserie, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Natural Jus
3
Good ambiance. Average service for this quality of restaurant
Warm Veal Tongue starter was good. However the Tasting of New York sirloin whilst good was nothing to shout about. I think the prices are too high for what is served
5
Probably the best steak I have had in Singapore. Great service, very attentive. Starters were phenomenal, rib-eye steak was close to perfection and dessert was sublime.
A wholly awesome experience.

Quick summary: how can a celebrity chef restaurant in MBS serve tasteless steaks and allow guests to wear sports wear and T-shirts and still get 2-star?
1
Went for a birthday dinner, very excited about visiting. Our starter was the steak tartare, very nice and had me very optimistic about our mains, but unfortunately we were in for a huge disappointment. I like my steak rare, and had gone for the English aged rib eye. The steak was almost black on the outside, slightly over seasoned and was a little overcooked in the middle, more medium rare than rare. The over caramelisation of the outside combined with the medium rare steak lead to a very strange and quite unpleasant aftertaste. I had to return the steak, both my partner and I agreed it was quite inedible and they suggested I have the US Prime Rib eye instead. When this came it was again slightly over cooked but this time had no flavor at all and was totally bland. It probably would have been ok with a peppercorn sauce or similar but with no sauce it was very unpleasant to eat as had no flavor. My partners steak was better, though again slightly overcooked, she ordered medium rare and received more medium and was over seasoned.The service however was fantastic, our waiter especially was very understanding, and could tell was embarrassed by our experience and deeply cared about the impact it had to our evening and did everything he could to try and make it right.Finally, this is a high end and very expensive restaurant with a supposed dress code. As such we made an effort to dress appropriately. We were quite disappointed that on the table next to us a guy was wearing a full Adidas tracksuit, which seemed a non-issue for the staff
4
Steak was cooked to perfection when itcomes to doneness. I just think that the seasoning was too overwhelming as its a high quality beef that doesn't need much of it to appreciate the quality of the beef, right? The serving was relatively generous. My fiancé and I well, we're so full! Reasonably priced! Service was as good!
3
The best is the service which is excellent, for the rest can not be seriously a 1* Michelin star Do not misunderstanding: the restaurant is very good but absolutelly in line with steakhoses in Spore.They also need to improve the welcome given by the waiters, 2 girls, at the desk and the one bringing you to the table; that was very cold and not professiona
5
We pass by The Cut so many times. This time me and wife decide to have a early anniversary dinner here. I ordered the Kobe Beef and my wife ordered Pork Chop. For dessert we had Chocolate Soufflé. The Kobe Beef was so tender and juicy. I love it so much, but I don't really like with the seasoning for the Kobe. On the other hand the pork chop was surprisingly perfect. And the way they present and deliver the soufflé really unique and taste delicious. Ah by the way. The mini potato balls for appetizer is a MUST. It was by recommendation and I don't disappointed at all. The service was the champion. They really nice even though we are first timer and not really dressed for fine dining. The waiter the head-waiter all are very nice and attentive. It was so wonderful. You felt welcome.
4
I think the food is severely over-priced. While they are all good and plated well, that's the minimum that you would expect from a famous chef's chain. Would i go back here? Probably not. I'd rather spend my well-earned money on the restaurant across - Mozza
5
From all the doom and gloom news about the economy you see these days, you'd think it's all a bunch of nonsense when you step into Cut mid-week.We went for my birthday on a Wednesday night and IT WAS PACKED!!! The main dining room in the front, PACKED. I went to the restroom in the back and i was surprised to see another large dining area which was also PACKED. These guys are raking it in!And the food is why - it was AMAZING. My wife and I aren't big eaters so getting a coupe of 300g steaks plus appetisers, sides and a desert didn't seem like a smart move - we were delighted to find they had a steak sampler dish for S$250 where they give approx. 330g of 3 different types of meats: one USDA sirloin, and two wagyu (one American and one AMAZING Japanese variety). We were NOT disappointed! They provided 3 different sauces to pair with the cuts, but honestly, you can safely do without adding sauce as the steaks themselves are so flavorful, it would almost be a crime to mask the original flavor with sauce.The True A5 Kobe, Honshu was the highlight of the sampler. Just melts in your mouth.These guys know how to cook steak. Amazing char color and flavor, perfectly cooked according to our preference (medium).The "Alaskan King Crab & Shrimp “Louis” Cocktail, Spicy Tomato-Horseradish" appetizer was very tasty, and so was the "Maple Glazed Pork Belly, Fuji Apple-Yali Pear Salad, Sesame–Orange Dressing". (A great spin on the classic Asian fatty pork!)The two sides we got were the Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg (GET THIS!), and the Patatas Bravas were super yummy too. But, a word of caution - these two sides were quite heavy. Very good quantity for two to share.We had the Valrhona Chocolate Soufflé for desert as it seemed closest to a birthday cake. It was good, but I'm kicking myself as I was recommended by a good friend to get the Kaya “Baked Alaska” and I completely forgot. NEXT TIME!We're definitely coming back
3
Usually service here is excellent, the only problem I have is that the main courses are sometimes ridiculously large. But on our last visit the service was stroppy, waiters treated us as inferior, and it's really really annoying, when asking to share the whole chicken with a fellow diner (baby chicken but far far too big for one person) to be told it's actually only small, as if I'm just so stupid that even though I've been there lots of times I still want to order a dish which wastes so much food. They still serve great cocktails, though the waiter made ordering them a more painful experience than it should have been
5
What a great experience: arguably the best steak I have tried including New York Strip loin and Japanese Wagyu. My husband. Chose a 1 kg lobster. Staff were attentive.
Just remember to bring your check book as our meal for 3 was just under $1k
5
nice atmosphere, although lightly dark. very friendly staff. meat was fantastic, perfectly cooked and of high quality. assides we had potatoes with garlic (yummie!) and onion rings (not greasy). quite pricy place but its worth it!!
5
Amazing package of food drinks and service. Yes the price is a bit higher than usual, but as well what you get is a bit more and better than usual! go there, you will not regret it!
5
Whist I agree with most, Cut @ MBS is quite a punchy night out on the Credit Card, it really is the best Steak in Singapore. The food is exquisite and very well prepared. No complaints and would be happy to break the bank once a year for a special night at cut!

Compared to other Michelin star places this place is not worth it. Also compared to other good steak houses they cannot make it if you take into account the price you pay.The steak was nice, nothing wrong but also nothing spectacular compared with other other steak places in Singapore. Not to mention some steak places outside of Singapore. $360++ for a steak for 2, while at other places I can get 2 different cuts for less than half the price which are as good (in Singapore).Service is terrible for a 2 star Michelin guide restaurant. I don't eat sauce or sides with my steak. I prefer to be able to eat dessert. The sauce also usually spoils the taste of the steak in my opinion. The waiter was trying to sell sides and sauces. In the end we did get 2 sauces and 4 types of mustard without ordering them so don't know where the comment "without sauce or sides your steak is boring" came from. Just trying to add $$ to your bill? If I would have ordered sauce after that comment I would have felt cheated. I didn't touch the sauces at all so cannot comment on quality. We always had to call the waiter to order. Pretty amazing in a 2 Michelin star place. There is also very little interaction with waiters. No coffee offered with dessert, they didn't even bother to ask. No need to push but just asking would be nice. Many mistakes which should not happen for a $650 bill for 2.Won't return, this place is not worth it at all. All items are ok but the price you pay is extremely high and service is not good
5
Was lucky enough to try both of his restaurants. If you are a carnivore lover this is the place to try. You can choose your meat from either Japan,USA and Australia. Be prepared to pay though. Extras are not included. Amazing wine selection. Great ambience in the restaurant. Very atmospheric. 
5
Just really a fantastic meal. Have only the highest of praise. Very nice menu. Not large. Mixed assortment of starters. My daughter had the crab. Served lovely fresh breads. We both had the fillet medium. Cooked to perfection with side onion rings and French fries. Skin on. Served with all the condiments. Large wine list. Some very expensive. Glad had a chance to eat there. No room for dessert. Highly recommend

I had a good chance to experience fine dining in Cut by Wolfgang last night. It was a perfect time to spend with colleagues to celebrate special occasions. First off, the service was very good. Attentive and warm. From the receptionist to the waiters. From appetizers to desserts. Service was consistent. Food delivery was simultaneously done for everyone in the table. No one was left without their order. This is unique. Even from the waiter's explanation of the different meat types, the quality and consistency were evident. Now onto the food, which is the meatier part (no pun) of the dining experience. Wolfgang's Cut is, so far, the best steakhouse I've been to in Singapore. I haven't been to all of them though, but just the same, it ranks at the top of my list now. I ordered the asparagus for my starter and the USDA prime ribeye for my main. The warm asparagus had poached egg and crispy bacon with mushrooms, layered with a nice vinaigrette. This was paired with a bottle of cold Kirin Ichiban lager, together with focaccia bread and breadsticks. Very good start. Glad to be with someone who knew what to order. My ribeye steak was cooked medium and, as expected, was tender and juicy. Fantastic texture. The flavor was significantly enhanced with my choice of sauce - armagnac and green peppercorn. But if you want the standard taste, the house made steak sauce is a very good choice as well. All the steak goodness was without the usual oil at the bottom of the steak. They know how to prepare the meat well. Australian cabernet sauvignon perfectly accompanied the steak. We had sides of french fries with herbs, tempura onion rings and macaroni. Dessert was valrhona chocolate soufflé with french cream and white chocolate ice cream. It had a wow factor at the start with the waiter pouring the chocolate syrup on top, poking a small hole on the soufflé, placing a scoop of ice cream and topping it with chocolate syrup again. Awesome dessert. But I was just too full from the heavy ribeye. Two thumbs up for this restaurant. Highly recommended. Be prepared with a huge bill though, as it is not a regular restaurant. Oh well, quality food and service come with a price tag. A premium price tag. But it's a no-brainer. You would want to come back.
2
We were invited by a couple of friends. There was a private party and the noise level was so high that we could hardly talk to each other. We chose our cut (average 200 dollars/person) and what was my surprise when the plate arrived. The steak was standing alone.. meaning not even a leaf for deco. We ordered some greens and they brought a small plate with some greens and tomatoes. You can find the same at any fast food place. Luckily the company was great. Totally overprice
5
I ate here with a friend and the food and cocktails were amazing. The bill for the two of us ran about $400+ but the meal was worth every penny. We ordered quite a bit from a few cocktails each, appetizers (my favorite was the tuna tartar), steaks, brussel sprouts, and mac-n-cheese. Everything had such robust, bright, and clean flavors. Kudos to the chef. We spoke with him at the end and since we are poor arts teachers he sent us a dessert - a Baked Alaska with an Asian twist. My only sad comment is we cannot afford to eat there every day! Thanks for such an amazing and delicious evening and to the chef for the fabulous dessert!!!!
3
Good quality but not sure if the price tag justify the price. Service is great too with an excellent in-house sommelier. Overall is good but not in the league of great.
5
Expect high prices but equally high quality meats. Our bill came up to SG$235 a person with a cocktail.
The Blackmore Angus was well worthit. Perfectly aged and succulent.
The char on the exterior was deep. But without any strong burnt arroma.
Excellent
5
Cut by Wolfgang Puck is synonymous with quality steaks and wonderful wine pairing.They certainly know where to source and handle the premium steaks the right way. Personally I feel that it's one of the few restaurants in Singapore or in the world, that treat the steak with care and respect. The Blackmore Angus steaks were full of flavour and tenderness; the wine list was impressive and pairing suggested by the sommelier was appropriate and complementary. It was a great dining experience from the food and wine alone. This experience did come with a premium in the bill.Service was pleasant and friendly and ambiance was fine though the lighting could be just a bit brighter.Overall it's a beautiful evening
2
When scrolling through the menu and take a glance at the price tags, you are fully expecting for your taste buds to experience some sort of out of body experience. Unfortunatley that wasn't the case as my $200 steak, although rare in the middle was actually burnt on the outside. When going to a wolfgang puck restaurant you know what you are getting yourself into in terms of price, but you also expect to eat the best steak you've ever had, which is absolutely wasn't. I wouldn't be able to recommend anybody to come to this restaurant.
3
Do not know when the Michelin man was here. Tonight the atmosphere was ok, music terrible, waiters doing their best, sommelier very good, food - no where near a star, it was ok,but that is it. Prices are at Michelin level and not corresponding to the actual experience, sorry to say.
5
Amazing service & amazing food definitely worth visiting if in Singapore!! It is located in the mall by the marina deck, the prices are quite pricey but you can't go there and not get the steak. The waiter/specialist comes to your table with all different types of cuts to explain to you the difference with each one, they are also very attentive and do not try to force you to buy the most expensive cut. I chose the NY filet which was SGD 80, definitely melt in your mouth type of steak
3
We made a reservation by mail in advance and the restaurant replied immediately. They even asked for special occasion...I asked for a romantic table for two, which we got. It was a very nice atmosphere with dimmed lights. Service was great and attentive. The food was ok. Hand cut fries weren't very delicious, also the grass fed beef steak sirloin was pretty oily (been cooked in a pan instead of a grill?!) and not as delicate as I expected. The salmon was not very fresh, but it was ok. Creamy spinach was ok. + Fresh bread was very delicious.The price didn't make us feel better about the food as it is really expensive! > Have a look at our bill
5
I visit Cut Beverly Hills whenever I'm in LA so when my wife and I found there was a Cut near our hotel it was a no brainer! The feel of the place is similar although darker and the menu familiar. We both opted for the wagyu fillet with a variety of side dishes. The food was very good but the flavour not quite up to the standard when we've visited before but the service remains very good although you are paying a fairly big price for it. If you like a good steak and good wine, still worth a visit but be prepared for the bill at the end
4
Late booking didn't work here, but I'm not surprised. It's a superbly presented, professional set-up - and expensive even for Singapore. I made the walk-in and sat at a table in front of the bar. The staff was clearly accustomed to welcoming and serving sad, sole, business clients. They were excellent!This was my treat night, so I stuck to steak. American wagyu rib-eye. Nothing wrong with it, though not the tastiest steak I've had. Cooked to perfection. Not sure about the fried egg mixed in with the creamed spinach, but I enjoyed it all the same. I won't mention the onion rings - damn, I did! Delicious and hopefully cooked in a healthy oil. Wine is extortionate! I opted for a half bottle of the Chateau de By; $75. It cut through the, er, healthy oil. Finished with coffee so, no dessert review. Music was my era. Downsides? Cost for sure. Middle of a shopping precinct/mall? Maybe. In Singapore? Definitely! I'm going to try the one in London when I get back and my waistline has come down a little.
4
We came by only for drinks and i ordered the house speciality , Rough love. It came with campagne inside it.( forgotten the coction) had a nice little raspberry balanced on top of a big ice block. Great presentation and taste! Fruity taste. Not cheap at sgd 26 but worth a try at least once!
5
Attended a private event here. My first time at the restaurant and I was amazed by the ambiance of the restaurant and the service of the staff here - really courteous and professional. We had the Wagyu beef and it was simply excellent!
3
Nice venue inside, service was just acceptable (bordering on slow) and the steak was 7 out of 10. Considering the price of the meal, I would not return as there are better places.
5
Part of the "celebrity restaurants" area in the Marina Bay mall. Happy to take a walk in, very friendly staff. I had the Tuna Tartare and the Baby Chicken. Tuna was fabulous, amazing flavour combination, with the sweetness of the tuna and avocado being balanced by the heat in the sauce, the peppery crisp and thr mellow wasabi aioli The baby chicken was enormous! Cooked perfectly, with some mushrooms and a broth, it was way too much for one person to finish in their own. Amazing flavour though.I also had a mocktail with passion fruit and mint. It was nice but the portion didn't justify the price. Very good experience overall.
4
The service was not outstanding, but good. The atmosphere from the outside looks a bit uninviting and sterile, but as you delve deeper into the restaurant there is a lovely buzzing ambiance. The food itself has a nice range of starters, but for main courses expect nothing but steak--understandably. The prices are expensive ranging from around $80 for the cheapest steak to $240 for the most expensive. Altogether including wine, starters, steak, and a shared desert, we paid around $950+, so it isn't cheap but may well be worth going to for a celebratory occasion
5
The restaurant looks unappealing on the outside but the inside is a very signature style of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants. Sam gave really awesome recommendations and we had no regrets with the food! Jerry had a great sense of humour and our overall dining experience was an incredible one! Service is prompt, faster than we expected. Price point was very reasonable, more than happy to pay for such lovely food
5
Cut isn't an ordinary steakhouse. The hostesses are friendly the service is impeccable, the cocktails are out of this world (they have their own cocktail program), music is cool, and the food of course is rock solid! As soon as you walk into the restaurant, you feel special, funny enough one of the best things on their menu is the whole roasted baby chicken, a must try, especially when the black truffels or the morels are in season

What a memorable steak dinner from a renowned celebrity chef! The breads and starter were perfect pre-cursors to the entrees. We made sure not to stuff ourselves too much. The steaks were divine! Service was also superb. Kudos to Nickson, Ryan, and especially Angeline for the warm and hospitable service

My husband and I went to Puck's Cut restaurant, located in Singapore's Marina Bay Sands Shops, for our anniversary. Listed as a celebrity restaurant, we knew what we were getting into, but had a unique opportunity to try it. Thanks to a gift from close friends, we didn't have to pay for the whole mail, but what we got for a small mortgage was disappointing.Firstly, it is a beautiful restaurant, but the lighting makes it very hard to read the menu. A bit less on the page or a bit more light would have helped. Nonetheless, we made our choices of steak and waited. The filet mignon was gorgeous; soft, flavorful and beautifully presented alone on the plate. It was also cooked exactly the way I ordered (medium rare). My husband's ribeye was also cooked the way he requested and we shared an order of the recommended creamed spinach. Very nice. The service was excellent and discreet, but, like most Asian restaurants, they are constantly refilling the wine and water glasses, hoping that you will finish and buy more. We hate that, preferring to let our wine sit and be enjoyed with the meal. Unfortunately, due to Puck's Michelen star reputation, everything is scandalously overpriced and it doesn't leave you saying "Wow!" And this was our big complaint. My 170gm steak was 88SGD. I can buy a kilo of similar quality USDA filet, in Singapore's specialized meat market for about 70 SGD. The wine prices are even worse, with some bottles of good wine costing as much as 500 SGD. Even the uber-rich can see how senseless that is. In the end, it was a good meal, but not great. It cost a small fortune that we would never spend again on a meal. I've eaten in Puck's restaurants in other cities and sadly, they are all consistently overpriced for a 'meh' experience. In my opinion, don't waste your money

What do you expect from the celebrity chef who caters to the stars during the Academy Awards? Nothing less than than the best. Everything was superb, from the pre-meal breads, the side dishes and, of course, the steaks. They even surprised us with a complimentary sorbet after the meal to wish us a great wedding anniversary celebration. Great ambience and fantastic customer service! Thank you, Angeline, Nickson and Ryan for making this evening even more memorable
5
If possible start off your evening by having a drink in the outside bar to watch the sunset, then dinner inside. The all-window dining area is a wonderful place to dine and still be able to view the surrounding areas. As expected Wolfgang Puck offered some of the best food
4
I will start by saying the food here is great and the prices do match. Expect to pay £150-£200 per head. What disappointed was that at those prices you expect a fine dining experience. Other reviewers have not commented on the fact you have to walk through the shopping mall. The ladies in our group were dressed for a fine dining experience so were really over dressed as walking through the mall with casually dressed shoppers. Inside the restaurant service is quick and efficient but then again you didn't feel relaxed and enjoying a serene evening.
5
Purely went here based on Wolfgang's reputation back home in the States and it didn't disappoint. It is quite posh, so if this type of experience isn't your norm, you will notice it. Don't let that detour you as the service was great and the food was even better. It does cost a small fortune but aged beef is amazing..... we went for the 21 day Ribeye and Filet. All your side are a la carte. It was a great evening for our long overdue date night. A bit too dark an posh for pictures, sorry
3
This expensive dinner was a disappointment for all four of us. The steaks were good - not outstanding and not worth the US$100 each. But the most disappointing was the rushed service. We felt like we were in a casino restaurant. Rush the customers in, take their money and rush them out
3
We went there with high expectations from many positive reviews, but we were not impressed as our expected. The steaks were out of order, how come for overcooked. Even they served us the new plates but we failed already for the best steak in town. Anyway, the atmosphere was quite nice and peaceful for friends and couple. Please don't believe me, you have to try and judge it yourself
4
The steak we ordered was cooked to perfection, and everything else tastes divine. The only downside was that we find the restaurant side to be quite dark to eat comfortably. I understand ambiance, but at some point, extra lighting won't hurt. Price was a bit high but you get your money's worth. Definitely worth a next visit.

If any one in singapore and looking to eat what i call a Steak i do not think any where will beat CUT ... stuff are too kind and friendly the wine list is crazt personally i didn't know all of then i usually go for French/italian wine .. my one and only knows that the price littel up but end of the day ur doing this once a month ! cheers y'all
3
To start the meal I thought I'd have a glass of champagne/sparkling wine and couldn't believe the glasses started from $40++!! As I hadn't heard of many of the wines on the menu I thought perhaps all the selected wines were of a very high quality but then I spotted a cheap, and not particularly good quality, Australian wine (approx $10 per bottle when bought in Australia) being sold for $90++.....that annoys me! Moving onto the steaks....starting at $80++ with no sides included, I just feel is completely excessive.At these prices I would expect the service to be impeccable and while for the most part it was fine, I felt that someone should have offered to explain the menu to us, as would happen at most fine dining restaurants of this calibre, I.e explain to me why it is worth me paying well over $80 for a steak ha! In saying all this, the food was delicious, however I would not return or recommend to others due to the exorbitant prices.
5
Cut came highly recommend and they didn't disappoint. From start to finish they didnt miss a beat, made my wife feel special accommodating her dietary requirements without a fuss. Truly the best steak I've ever eaten anywhere. Not to mention all the extra goodies throughtout the experience, the breads and petite fours out of this world.Wish Cut was in Australia.
4
We were planning on having a romantic dinner in this place, but the seating is very close one to another, like being in a food court.They have booth seating but since the place is packed (so RSVP is a must), you have to be lucky to get a seat there. Apart from the noise; food wise, all was stunningly delicious. Starting from the bread, starters, steaks, desserts, all prepared perfectly. Try the crab salad, it is super mouthwatering. Steak was cooked perfectly as per request.Can't complain much. The staffs are all helpful. Price for 2 pax dinner here with a bottle of wine could reach approx SGD 500-700.
5
I took my husband here for his birthday. The room is quite large but we had no problem conversing. It has an elegant atmosphere and the food was absolutely amazing. The meat so tasty I did not even use the sauce. The vegetables we were recommended to have with the meat was equally tasty. Together with some red wine it was perfect. When I booked the table they asked if it was a special occasion and I informed them it was my husband´s birthday. So even though we did not order dessert they presented him with a beautiful, very fresh and delicious little cake to share. I thought that was a lovely and unexpected gesture
5
Loved this restaurant, memorable entree & cocktails, great service and great vibe, returning to Singapore in April & decided to stay an extra night for a return visit to this restaurant
5
I was quite amazed with how many people go to the restaurant despite the pricey rate. But after trying it out there, it proves that it is worth it. People who are meat-lovers would surely not regret going there.
4
Staying at the Marina Bay Sands (which is excellent by the way) a friend and myself who are in hospitality decided to dine here. We went with rather full stomachs which was our fault. The menu was expensive with an array of meats and seafood on offer. I couldn't fault the service at all. Like all good restaurants around the Marina Bay all staff were excellent. The restaurant itself was perhaps a bit dark and brooding, but definitely stylish and an experience.The kitchen spilt meals we wished to share into seperate plates for us (without asking) and everything was just fine. At the prices though, you expect to be blown away. This is good meat. Just not the best I've had.
4
We all have our expectations and mine of CUT was of an elegant, stylish atmosphere with the muted buzz of dining patrons. Alas the reality was different with loud rock, heavy metal and alternative music being played. To the credit of the staff, the music was turned down after we complained. Equally surprising, for not to say disappointing was to find patrons in torn jeans, T-shirts, slippers and base ball caps in the restaurant - especially so after having received an email from CUT about the dress-code being ''Casual elegant''. The reality is far from it. Where our expectations were fully met was the truly excellent, professional service (by Rasul) and wonderful food which was served. Compliment to both the service and the kitchen for such high standards. Prices are on the high side. So look our for credit card promotions which can bring some relief to an high restaurant check
1
Unimpressed, server asked restaurant guest to clear her own bread plate whilst server served the main course - steak. Then why are we paying 10% service charge to get ridiculous service? We asked for a private seating area to celebrate our anniversary, however was given a aisle table whereby everyone walked past and could feel the feet thumping, vibration on the ground. We were served with burnt steak as well. Definitely a over-rated restaurant, our last patronage and never going back there 
5
This is not just a restaurant or bar, its an "experience".We were a large group of 10 people, all sat at the bar n each one ordered a different drink. I cannot say which one was the best, since each was as unique as the other. It wasnt just the taste of the cocktail, but also the aroma that hits the nose right when you are about to take a sip. Not to mention that the glassware and aesthetics fair equal points too.A special mention for the clearer-than-crystal ice cubes used for the drinks which are proportionately cut by the expert mixologists!And ofcourse the mixologists was friendly and chatty, adding to whole experience.MUST MUST MUST visit
5
We have decided to go to this place with my Husband as we both love meat.I have to say we cannot regret at all ! We be eaten a HUGE, tender and excellent piece of meat.The atmosphere of the restaurant is Super nice for couples (candles everywhere).I took spinach with eggs on top of my meat, it was also excellent.I really hope to go back again soon
5
My husband took me here for one of most expensive meals ever. Fortunately for him, I'm vegetarian so that dulled down the bill by a few hundred dollars! The wine list was large, cocktails delicious and we were provided with top notch service. I particularly liked the darkness of this restaurant. I don't think I've ever been anywhere so dark before! Took us a little while to locate the restaurant but it was lovely walking around Marina Bay Sands anyway.
5
We were quite surprised to find such a quality restaurant located in the center of Marina Bay shopping mall, but it did not make one bit of difference. As you walk in to the restaurant the quality just leaps out at you, from the layout of the place to the name etched in to the table. The menu selection was very good and you could not fault the quality of any of the food, starters were very good, well presented and of good proportions. The steak was cooked to perfection just as we had asked. Some steaks were of quite a large size so ensure you have not eaten to close to going. Side dishes were very good and more than enough size wise to share. The wine list went from the reasonable to the very expensive but I would say there is something on there for everyone's taste. Certainly a place we will be going back to visit again

We came here last night for a nice dinner. My husband has been wanting to try this number 9 of restaurants in Singapore by Tripadvisor rating. So i thought it was a perfect treat I could give to my husband. Make sure u make reservation as this place tends to get full especially on the weekends. The location for me is a bit funny inside MBS mall. We had to go all the way in to find this restaurant on B1 level. When we finished eating, the shopping mall was already closed and many cleaning staff were working. The ambience itself was impeccable. Love every bit of it with movie stars artistic pin-ups on the wall. I recognised Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Love the dimmed lighting and music selection. The food itself personally, i found a bit too pricey. Maybe also i was not familiar with the high living cost in Singapore and thought it should be cheaper than HK. But apparently not. We had the USDA fillet mignon for 80 SGD. Other kind of beef like US wagyu filler mignon starts at 170 SGD - which again i found a bit too much. Don't even think about getting real Japanese wagyu with this price. The starters and side dishes also were in this category of price. We ended up having 1 starter to share, 2x fillet mignon for main, and apple crumble as dessert to share. The meat was great, juicy and cooked the way I requested. Wine selection was amazing and their house wine was also good. Their whiskey selection, again, i felt a bit too pricey but of course it can be very subjective. Staff were great, attentive and knowledge. Overall experience was satisfying. But for me it will take a while before we will decide to come back here.

It was our wedding anniversary and we had a good time having great food and good service. Was a pleasure having Irlan, Manny and Teong serving us. Love the bread sticks and complimentary bread!!
4
Had dinner with family even if my parents are bit hesitant because of the price. But everything was perfect! Steaks here are really to die for!
5
The best of the best as usual keeping its high standards of NYC. Right next to the MBS theatre incase you want to watch a show/musical after a beautiful dinner. Always a pleasure to dine here. Superb selection of wines. Highly recommend this for couples who like to enjoy a great evening out together. Also has a private room for small groups
4
Our first time to CUT for dinner. we tried the japanese wagyu and the angus for desert, it was valrhona chocolate souffle'. Overall, it didn't give me the WOW factor. With so much review and raving, it didn't reach to our expectation. Service was top notch. Overall, nothing to complain
5
Cut was full on a Monday nite! For 2 of us we ordered a 120 grams Hokkaido snow wagyu highly marbled cut at $240 and an American wagyu to compare. Plus the big eye tuna n kind crab starters n Mac n cheese. Loved everything especially my Japanese A5 beef even though it was $2 per grams, it was done exactly the way I like it, burnt n crusty outside and medium inside so it melts like butter in my mouth!
5
My Husband and I enjoyed our first dinner on our honeymoon at this restaurant and it was the best experience. The food was out of this world, our waiters Sam, Irlan and Teong were exceptional. If you are in Singapore at any point, Cut by Wolfgang Puck is a must!
4
This is my second visit and I was not to be disappointed, from arrival until we left an absolutely amazing experience. Great friendly staff from the front desk, the barmen and the servers. The food was exceptional and well worth every penny. The wine lists and drinks were just what one is looking for in such a restaurant. a place to take your guests make sure you book. Enjoy
5
I visited here with friends for a birthday party. I've wanted to go here for a long time and finally got the chance! Hands down it was the best meal I have ever eaten! We didn't order starters but the steaks were amazing, and dessert was out of this world. Had 2 cocktails that tasted great too! I was a bit worried about the cost and It's high end prices, but everything from the service, food, drinks and ambience made it totally worth it.
2
If I wanted to go to a restaurant surrounded by high chairs and full of children I would have gone to Mc Donald's!I really wanted to go to Cut so called early in the morning only to be told by the Russian accented telephone receptionist who we later were greeted by that the only times available were 17:30 and 21:30. I take the 17:30 slot thinking I will just slow things down and enjoy evening. On arrival 17:45 the place was 15% full and didn't really pass 75% by the time we left at 20:00. I can't believe that there was so many no shows so being made to feel that we were lucky to get a table when in fact we could have walked in at 20:00 is bad practice. It gets worse, the champagne was warm on arrival and my bone marrow starter was set back. One of the two portions was ok the 2nd had deserted the marrow and was full of cream. We sat in a 3 table line up with couples each side of us...... completely surrounded by children!! Seriously most places would have the common sense to better arrange diners. Putting couples in a more romantic section! Instead of having to deal with screaming and running from table to table. All in All Cut by Wolfgang Puck, is in my humble opinion and from a man that has eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world over priced over rated and a waste of a good evening.I shan't be returning and would advise anyone considering to dine here to give it a wide berth.
5
Have read / heard about bad experiences of others and was told that it'd be super expensive. Well, we had a great experience here. The service was great! Couldn't complain at all. No complains at all! The staff was attentive and gave us some specials when they found out it was close to kind of a special occasion for us. Food was SUPERAWESOME!!! TO DIE FOR!!!! The meat... OHHHHhhhhh the meat......... woah..... it was sooooooooooooooo good. Everything was perfect. Then came the bill. Holy smokes! What a price to pay for a little slice of heaven. Was it worth it? Yes. Can't come here all the time but this is one of the places where you must try at least once
5
This is an excellent meat restaurant. We have ordered UK Red Poll Rib eye, chestnut soup and few salads. Chestnut soup was on the heavier side -too creamy- but the rest were excellent. Of course the Rib Eye was the super star!
5
This place is just wow. Everything in here is is perfect, from the atmosphere to the amazing food, down to the attentive staff serving us. Every dish served to us is like a work of art. You can be sure we'd be back again soon!
5
Cut is and will be always one of my favorite spots to go... Have been there several times and it's always beyond expectations. Food is amazing, service is great & atmosphere is cosy & grant at the same time.
5
Just ate at Cut tonight! One of the best meals I've had anywhere!!! Ate at the bar. Bar staff were fantastic. All service was great and the steak was incredible!!!! It's spendy, but really fantastic food!!!
5
Expensive.
Service was 10 out of 10
Presentation was awesome.
Not suitable for young kids.
Menu was excellent.
5
The Premier steakhouse in Asia, excluding Japan of course (that's just a whole different beast - pun intended!). Wish they would open a branch in Hong Kong!!
5
Wow! Absolutely amazing experience, would love to go back! Great cocktails as well, you should definitely try. Outstanding wine collection..
4
food was tasty and portions were good, service was very efficient just something in their attitude, didnt feel very warm. Overall food good ambient average.
5
We are a group of friends dine in Cut and ordered American Wagyu New York, U.S.D.A Prime Ribeye, Pork and three sides (cream of spinach, peewee potatoes and brussels sprouts). Everything is cooked perfectly and We all like it very much. The Place is really awesome and the service was superb and friendly. Thanks to Irlan, Rasul and Naga for a great service and will definitely come back again for more
5
My hubby took me for a date in this restaurant. Very nice interior design, romantic atmosphere and the best customer service in Singapore. The waiters are professional for their meals and wine. We ordered a 900g of Ribeye steak ( our eyes are bigger than our tummy for sure), but gladly we did eat all without any waste. Most of their steaks are big, so if you are not a big eater like us, we deeply recommend you to share food rather than for yourself only. Btw, very expensive tho
5
My first time at this place definitely made a whole lot of an impression. Blown away by their excellent customer service. Good place for couples celebrating occasions.
5
My wife and I spent a wonderful evening at Cut for our wedding anniversary.
The starters and steaks were excellent and service was impeccable with Marilou tending to our needs and making sure it was an enjoyable experience!
Would definitely come back again.
5
Large portions, the right beef and cooked right.I think it is one of the best places to eat steak in Singapore.
5
This restaurant is amazing..... It has the best steak in Singapore i recon. Really really tasty. There is also an amazing selection of wines.
4
If you like a very good steak, do come here it's that good. I have been a fan of Wolfgang Puck and his chain of different Restaurants and this one does not disappoint.
5
This is by far a superior place to Spago. Better food, better atmosphere and much more inviting. Very pleased with my dine here.
4
A few minutes stroll from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in The Shoppes.Greeted by very friendly staff and after an aperitif taken to the rear half of the restaurant.The atmosphere was busy but not over loud so we could still hold a conversation. The walls are lined by a "library" of wines which is very impressive and sets the scene perfectly.Service was extremely efficient and friendly. An bouche amuse of a baked potato with creme fraiche and caviar was a little heavy and out of context.We started with Alaskan King Crab salad which was beautiful and delicate followed by Suffolk Ribeye which was good and the Iberian Pork Chop that was superb. Perfectly cooked and charred on the outside but beautifully sweet and juicy when cut into.Both mains came with generous portions of vegetables.For dessert we chose the Chocolate Souffle (for 2) which was extremely indulgent and we savoured and enjoyed every mouthful.Coffee and petit fours rounded off an excellent meal.Was it worth nearly S$800 (Â£450) for 2 including 4 glasses of reasonable wine and service? I believe the answer is yes-Just!!The only sad feature we noted was that the majority of diners spent more time on their mobiles and tablets than on savouring the food and atmosphere and holding a proper conversation. They were probably texting across the table!
2
My family chose to treat ourselves at Cut by Wolfgang Puck since we are embarking into a diet encompassing well cooked proteins and vegetables. Despite the hype of this place, the food and service was just an absolute disappointment. While the bread and pumpkin soup were nice starters, the best was yet to come. I ordered the Filet Mignon, and asked for it to be done to medium. Unfortunately, the meat was just too salty for my liking, and I had to take a drink of water after every two bites of the meat. The service rendered by the staff was average, and nothing like what I have seen in other fancy restaurants. There is honestly nothing fantastic about this place, and no love lost for not going back a second time round. This is one place I can definitely cross off my list of restaurants
5
As you can see with our previous reviews, i spend a decent amount of time in steakhouses. In Singapore, a place Ireally wanted to try out was Cut in the Marina Bay Sands. To be a bit provocative - I tried the double cut pork chop - which is a great value and looked amazing in the description. Little did I know that it was an extraordinary experience - it tasted like a lean, yet extremely buttery and flavorful piece of ribeye steak! Paired with their fabulous fries and some wine - it was an excellent experience and value at the same time. While Cut surely is known for their wonderful steaks, I can attest to the high quality of their Pork Chop and highly recommend it to anybody. And, on top of that you get that wonderful Singapore high touch service at the same time. Overall, a great experience and a place worth trying while you are in Singapore and shopping in the Marina Bay Sands
5
We only got a chance to try some of the best food of our lives here, the reputation needs nothing but more praise.... we ordered the tempura onion rings and the pork belly.....just speechless is all I can say. This is worth coming back to Singapore in itself and a must visit!!
4
Visited CUT during a staycation at MBS. Loved the food and cocktails. Steaks were great and cooked to my expections (Medium-rare). Classic food combinations. However, still preferred burnt ends though.
5
This is an excellnet location also just for drinks. They serve some excellnet mixology cocktails, hand-crafted all with super-premium spirits and home made syrups and juices. Fantastic value/quality for money. Need to stop for Dinner next time!
5
One of the finest restaurants and steakhouse I have ever been to. Easily the most high-end steakhouse you can find in Singapore. Service is impeccable, absolute perfection. The captain was very knowledgeable on their products, able to explain every single dish before we ordered to great detail, and provided great recommendations.I had read up on blogs prior to my visit, and most of the articles were about the starters and the sides. Not much about the steak, but then again you have to taste it for yourself.Picked the Big Eye Tuna tartare, found it very refreshing. We ordered one portion but the kitchen gladly split it into two separate servings for me and my friend. Our sidedish was Spinach in cream sauce with fried organic egg. Very delicious, and unique.For main course, we had a grass-fed UK steak, and the extremely rare (and expensive) Hokkaido Snow Wagyu. Japanese Wagyu needs no explanation, and I have tasted numerous Wagyu beef. But the Snow wagyu is different, I read up a lot on it and realised its on the same page as Kobe beef, but even rarer, with only 4 restaurants in the world selling it. Must try if you are first time here and ready for a splurge. Same as the Tuna tartare, both steak were separated into 2 portions
1
Although CUT has been lauded by many to be one of the best at doing steaks in singapore, I humbly beg to differ. Its reputation has brought it far, but alas the food does not match up to the hype.Firstly, the quality of the steaks leave much to be desired. The flesh is way too fibrous and tough, while retaining little juice which is paramount in what a steak should have. Although I did get a USDA steak and did not get better one, I am actually relieved as if an establishment cannot cook a regular steak up to standard, i doubt they could do it even with better preparation.The steak itself was tough, fibrous, in the centre, with a crust that was equally tough without maintaining any surface moisture. They've tried too hard in trying for the "crispy" exterior that they've completely overdone it.At this point, they are riding on their coattails. Desserts leave much to be desired as well. Do not be fooled by the hype. Do not visit this establishment
5
We visited the resturant whilst staying at the Marina Bay Sands, located in the shopping complex and easy to find CUT is a wonderful location if you enjoy steak! We had a Porterhouse steak to share, and enjoyed this over freshly made cocktails and lager, the steak came out beautifully cooked. Best to have Medium Rare but all down to personal choice. The resturant was busy so we did book to reserve a seat, the staff are very polite and well trained to serve at high standard. They even gave us a little Birthday Surprise CakeNot cheap but well worth it for good steak 10/10
5
The nature of the steak is crazy. Indeed, even without the sauce, you simply require salt and pepper to appreciate the steak. Awesome administration and feel, the staff was inviting and accommodating. I went there for my wedding commemoration, and they gave me an integral sweet for nothing out of pocket. Value in like manner is somewhat steep, be that as it may, it is normal when you have a dinner of such quality. The main thing to observe is, the part of the steak itself. We under-gauge the circumstance and requested 2 prime rib, it was immense !! My significant other could just complete portion of her share and I wound up eating very nearly 500 grams of meat that day...Great encounter, unquestionably will return again for uncommon events
5
I came in to this establishment pretty late in the evening and was seated in the bar area which was fine, the menu was as impressive as it was expensive.Scallop carpaccio, and the USDA rib eye where amongst the best I have had all year, the steak especially was a brilliant cut of meat and cooked to perfection. The Truffle Fries where a let down, tasted WELL over done and the truffle oil seemed to be used rather sparingly, the Bearnaise sauce was mediocre, I did not ask for a new fries or sauce because the steak was perfect on its own, and that is something I have not enjoyed in a while. Please note, the food was so good I still gave the establishment 5 stars :
5
Not in Singapore for long so wanted to try CUT on my first night. I've been to their Vegas restaurant and this place is just as good. Steak was very expensive but every mouthful was a taste sensation. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with the service quick and efficient
5
I feel the title says it all. If you want one of the best cooked steaks this is the place to go. Service was very attentive. Surroundings very classy. Sides are very generous and each one is enough for 2 people in my view. The bread and parmesan bread sticks to start were equally impressive. Superb evening thank you.
5
Divine. Mouthwatering cuts are the hero with their accompaniments doing their delicious part. You get what you pay for here. The restaurant creates atmosphere with its darkened mood lighting and the finishes are of a fabulous quality. Service is top notch and the amenities are clean.A step above all other steak houses in the area
5
If you want a mouth-watering, great tasting, tender steak, you need to stop by for a Cut. The food and service are all excellent. Try the Saint Peter's Cream Stout with your steak. Awesome!
5
Loved the ambience, excellent food and excellent service. Would definitely revisit and recommend to friends.
5
This was our first time to this fine establishment and we loved everything about it. I figured Wolfgang Puck and his team would set the bar high considering the location. An American restaurant in Singapore is not the first restaurant that came to mind while we were visiting. However one evening we just wanted to have a meal that hit a little closer to home.We were seeking comfort in the form of familiarity and although the location of this restaurant was new to us, it hit the mark we were seeking
5
CUT by Wolfgang Puck at Marina Bay was were my wife and I celebrated our 20th Wedding AnniversaryFrom the reservations team that confirmed by email booking within 20 minutes, to staff that greeted us on arrival, to all the wait staff that had a smile all night, we can only sum up by giving the Cut a First Class Recommendation. The food was excellent and the ambience was classy and intimate. We ordered the UK Red Poll New York Sirloin and the Wagyu New York Sirloin with a side of Wild Field Mushrooms and Sauteed Broccolini. The steaks are served with a selection of mustards and to finish off we shared the Gula Melaka Cheesecake. All the food was excellent, especially the steaks. I am not normally a dessert person, but would list this dessert as one of the best I have ever had. Thank you to all the staff at the CUT for an anniversary evening to remember !! We will definitely be back next year when in Singapore
5
First up this isn't your standard steak place, it costs. That said, it is a couple of cuts above a standard steak place. The Minister of finance and I went there for a bit of a glam night on a business trip. We booked a few days earlier which was good as there was some function on when we got there. Apart from seeing them at the bar there was no intrusion in the restaurant itself. I found the restaurant a bit too dark for my liking but we were there for the food. We skipped entrees and went straight to the steaks. I had the English red poll sirloin and the MoF had USDA rib eye. Amazingly the restaurant has a medium rare + for those of us who like our steak more on the medium side of rare but not medium. I chose the house steak sauce the MoF bearnaise. It has been a long time since I've had a steak so good. Cooked exactly to my desires. The MoF had that same views on her food. The service was great, attentive but not overwhelming you got the feeling they were there to help you enjoy yourself. We did. I'd go back for a special occasion.
4
We had dinner with or friends for a special birthday. Found restaurant a little dark. Service was great, food was very good, although our chip were cold when they came to our table. All our meats and chicken were cooked very well. The bomb asaska was delicious
4
The restaurant is located within Marina Bay Sands. This is not any local, mid range restaurant. The beef served were of top grade and cost a premium. The food were wel executed, given it is owned by Michelin starred chef. Experience was good, the serving staff were friendly and helpful

Came here on our final night of holiday. Vibe very classy and service fine. Steaks were beautifully cooked with some plentiful side dishes. What wowed us though was they remembered me saying it was our last night when I booked and our soufflÃ© plate said 'Bon Voyage'. What a nice touch ! It's pricey yes but you get what you pay for in quality and experience.

Cut Steakhouse, by the famous chef Wolfgang Puck, has several locations around the world. In Singapore, it is ensconced in Marina Bay Sands, with a smart interior design that gives you some privacy from the bustling mall, and instead be stared at by blown-up Hollywood stars' photos on the walls. Quite classy.The menu has a good selection of dishes, even a few that accommodates vegetarians and pescatarians. But of course, you should come here for the beef. The steak selection leans toward the super expensive Wagyu (from Australia, US, or Japan), around the SGD 200 mark for a serving. Fortunately, wagyu is not my favorite as I prefer more chew from my steak.So I settled for the UK grass-fed ribeye (340 g), at a much more affordable SGD 90. While the meat quality was unquestionably good, more crisp on the outside would have made it better. The steak came with 5 "standard" sauces, but they also have signature sauces that you can order for extra SGD 5 each. For the value for money, though, I still prefer Bedrock Grill (another prime steakhouse in Singapore).As dessert, I had the porcupine-shaped Kaya "Baked Alaska", which was excellent as it was not overly sweet, with the delightful combination of coconut and pandan flavors. I appreciated that some of the desserts creatively feature the local tastes, such as this one and the Gula Melaka Cheesecake.Service was polite and attentive, without being anything special. One thing that disappointed me was the bread, because it was served cold. This shouldn't happen in a restaurant of this class, and can be easily rectified

Service was very disappointing. We were seated immediately upon arrival, and that was the last bit of service that went as hoped. The music was so loud we couldn't hear each other, and even after a request to turn it down, it remained uncomfortably loud. We were seated for 20 minutes before anyone took a drinks order, and those drinks took 25 minutes to arrive. 30 minutes after the drinks came, we finally managed to give in our food order. Food took a normal time to arrive, but it seemed like forever as we'd already been there so long.My husband and I shared the Porterhouse. We asked our server what temperature the chef recommended, and he didn't know. In a steak house! We ordered it medium rare, but it arrived medium well. We considered sending it back, but... It was already so late, and we didn't want to wait any more, and to cap it all off, no one ever came by the table to ask about our meal. Predictably, our seriously overdone steak was tough and not very tasty. Our friends were slightly more successful with their food orders, but still didn't find it good enough to match the prices and reputation. If we're going to pay the sun and the moon for a steak, it should be worth it. We could have had the same quality for less than half the price in a "normal" steak house. I feel like we paid double for the dubious honor of eating in a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and that's just not worth it to me. The food needs to stand up and speak for itself.We did not stay for dessert

Recommendation for this restaurant it is better than London. The meat treatment is perfect the Atmosphere and the service we enjoy

I cnt take beef so I always go there for the Lobster and pork... Really good! Nice places for couple especially sited on the bench seat... Good selection of wines and drinking place too...
4
Especially the Steaks are very good and cooked perfect The variety of the menue is good for a place like this. The quality is consistent (not my first visit) above average. Staff is efficient and friendly. The food is internationally quite expensive and wines overpriced. Unfortunately a standard remark for good Restaurants in Singapore
5
Came here for my Anniversary dinner. The food was excellent! Steak charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside. We ordered sides of Mac and cheese and Bone marrow. Both were cooked to perfection and perfectly complemented our steaks. We received a complimentary dessert for our Anniversary celebration! Wonderful end to a delish dinner!Must have the cocktails which are great value for money, very thirst quenching and easy to drink! Please don't drive because you won't know how potent they are until you stand up!I'll definitely be back
5
I went here for the first time recently and I can honestly say that I cannot fault it! The service was amazing, the food was to die for and the atmosphere is quirky yet sophisticated. They had portraits of actors/actresses on the menu and around the restaurant which was quite cool!In terms of the food, the bone marrow was amazing, the steak melted in your mouth and dessert was to die for!! I'm not a big wine drinker but my friend and I ordered a bottle of pinot noir and it was the smoothest red I've ever had! I would take a trip to Singapore just to go back here
5
Had excellent dinner with family (2 kids). As a true high-end restaurant it's not exactly family place but staff handled everything really well, even with our 2yo. Food was top notch as were the wine pairings as you'd expect with 600SGD dinner. Would definitely recommend to anyone!

When you paid premium price for a piece of small steak and you are expecting good service you are in for disappointment. Service was so bad that we have to flag down the server several times the night. Too many servers on the floor and all ended up talking to each other at the corner. Food is nothing to shout about as i have taste better ones elsewhere. Don't mind to go back for drinks as many have commented that its better (service wise and personality and of cos the drinks!) than the steak ;)
5
I cook meat all the time so I'm very critic when it comes to great steak. This is by far the best steak I've had and also the most expensive but you pay what you get. Everything in this place was great. The side orders, the service, the darky romantic setting. Great place, when I return to Singapore I will return to cut. Just search online you can find many menu pictures with the prices
5
This is a must visit every time we are in town. Reservations are recommended and dont despair if you get seated at the bar area as they will serve the full menu there as well. Speaking of the bar they do mix great cocktails.However this place is all about the food. Stunning bread - the pretzel and the parmesan crusted breadsticks are awesome, the little cheese buns served as you await your starter are great too. The asparagus with egg and the beetroot and goat cheese were both fantastic starters however nothing comes close to the Kobe beef sliders which are just delicious little packages and serve as an appropriate introduction to what is to follow.The steak is beautiful served with a selection of mustard and the choice of sauces is fantastic - go ahead and order as many as you want - 5$ a pop but totally worth it. The chocolate souffle to end is amazing but rest assured that with all that food - movement post meal will come at a premium.For an amazing experience - well executed, with warmth and great food to go with it - this a premium experience well worth the price

If you like steak then this is for you. The selections of cuts is extensive and the quality of our selection was beautifully cooked (rare for him and medium for her). Sides were also tasty as were the limited offerings of starters.My criticism was the impersonal service but the food was lovely but expensive.Lets face it there is only so much you can do with a steak but PUK has worked out that you can charge between $45 and $120+ for a piece of meat! Is this good value- no, but it is Marina Bay Sand
5
The steaks are impressive, especially the Kobe beef steak. I found it very very good, and the appetizers and side dishes are impressive as well, such as the blue cheese, cream spinach. Wine lists are amazing too by the way.. need to make reservations
4
We visited CUT for our wedding anniversary. The service is excellent and I love the buns so much. Ordered the grilled chicken besides the sirloin steak and we both love the dishes especially the mushroom sauce that came with the chicken. Lovely Michelin dining experience.
5
If you are in Singapore and want a fantastic steak, just go to cut. Forget everything else which may be more famous or cheaper or has a better view. Just go to Cut and indulge.
5
My first visit and I was pleasantly surprised. I was a little annoyed that they showed me to the bar when I asked for a table for one, but the experience was excellent. Great cocktails, starter and steak. I was even convinced to order a desert.If you really want a good selection of steak for every taste this is the place to go
5
Thank the Universe for CUT. I had been having some trouble finding high quality food to suit my Coeliac requirements during my one week stay in Singapore and had been eating rather blandly... until I found CUT. The host I had assigned to our table, Manuel I believe his name is, was the most phenomenal, knowledgeable attentive person I have ever had the pleasure of having guide me through the choices available to me as a Coeliac. Never before have I felt so comfortable about eating in a restaurant and have someone understand my dietary requirements beyond all my wildest expectations... for me you cannot put a price on the experience I was able to have and the ease that I was able to eat with knowing my requirements were truly understood and acknowledged... and the food... every mouthful of everything I ordered was exquisite and flavoured and seasoned to perfection. Which is why I had to come back again before my flight out ... I cannot wait to go back... I could not fault CUT at all. Perfection ✨✨
5
I enjoy a good steak so needless to say CUT was a necessity on my recent trip to singapore.Located in B1 at the marina bay sands, cut offers some great choices if you're a meat person. Their steaks are literally to die for. Prices are decent ($90-$250) depending on your selection. Service is great so there's no reason to miss this place if you're here.
4
Had a craving for good steak and went to cut by Wolfgang puck at marina bay sands.Ordered the rib eye Kobe beef and as usual it was cooked perfectly. There was little to fault this restaurant except for the very pricey wine list, although it is very well stocked.A meal for 2 usually always cost more than SGD 1000 for me.Besides the price point, you can expect one of the best done steaks in Singapore!
5
We went for a birthday dinner. There were 5 of us. The staff allow us to order "Family CUT" which is a set menu for 4. We added an Onion Ring side and a Baked Alaska dessert. The food especially the Bone-in Rib Eye was exceptional. The fried smashed new potatoes was a close second. Service was a bit slow with a sizable gap between starter and entree. The waiting staff keep coming back to let us know how long more we have to wait. So service recovery is excellent. When the bill arrive we found that CUT has given us the Baked Alaska free as a birthday present. Very thoughtful. At $500+, it is not cheap but I would go back again for the quality food. Other places may be cheaper but the food is much lower quality
5
I chose this restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday! I was excited about it as it was highly recommended by a friend, who recently celebrated her birthday there!The service and food was amazing! Complimentary pretzel bread, onion bread and baked cheese was served was delicious. We ordered the porterhouse medium rare for 2 to share, creamed spinach and onion rings. Everything was done to perfection and we were very satisfied with the food. The best part was they surprised us with a small cake! It was a very sweet gesture and we really appreciated it. Well done CUT! (Note: I did email CUT to request for complimentary small dessert/cake for the birthday celebration however CUT says they only do a scoop of ice cream. Hence, the cake was truly a surprise!

We have been to this restaurant for a few times. In general the service and ambience are great but not all the food. The servant always checks upon us about how we are doing. We have tried a verity of their steaks and we have enjoyed most of them except for the Wagyu steak. The main reason that we didn't enjoy the Wagyu steak was because it contains too much fat. We felt stuffed just after two bites. Even though we ordered only one piece of the Wagyu steak to share, which was about 200-250 grams, we could barely finish it. Because of the Wagyu steak, we could not finish the porterhouse and other dishes we ordered. If I ever go back to the restaurant, I would stick with meet with less fat content, e.g. Angus beef. Other than that, the complementary cheese bites and bread were a bit too salty.
5
I was so lucky and entered this restaurant at dinner time without reservation.
Steak was so nice and I fully enjoyed it
Service was also nice. I recommend this steakhouse!!
5
can't rate this restaurant enough. best steak I've ever had. had the american wagyu sirloin, and it was not from this earth. so tender, unbelievable. i looved the cream spinach with egg too.. service absolutely smashed it.

We had a few days in Singapore, and ate at Chinatown and Hawker Centres but wanted one "expensive" meal during our stay. Obviously this place is expensive; and very much so. And occasionally when you visit an expensive place, you set yourself up for a disappointment - simply, the place cannot live up to the price. I'm very happy to report that this absolutely doesn't describe Cut. Yes, the price was high, but we both felt we had had excellent value for money - the steaks we had (and indeed everything else; the sides, the service, *everything*) were spectacular. Truly spectacular. The service was welcoming and friendly. The food was REMARKABLE. Really, even down to the breads, even down to the little snacks whilst waiting.The price was high; I think our meal for two, with maybe a couple of drinks, was almost £200.00! But, and I can't be clearer about this, it is still *excellent* value for money. The price is high, but it is worth it. I'd consider stopping off at Singapore, overnight, simply to re-visit. I mean that seriously. One little tip if you're considering visiting Cut: There is a light show just next to the complex the restaurant is in. I think this is every night. Book your table to coincide with the end of the light show. In this way, you can catch the lightshow on the waterline (which is amazing and beautiful), then once done, go for your dinner. We didn't quite manage to time it perfectly, but still did manage to catch most of the show and still get a table
5
A very stylish restaurant within the vast Sands structure. From the outside, as you enter from a mall, it may not seem much, but the interior is very stylish. More so if you get one of the cubicles that seat 4 people. More private . Food variety is vast, though you will want to try one of their signature steaks. It is not cheap, but then Singapore is never cheap. Wine list is vast and full of wonderful choice from all over the world. Ideal for a special occasion
5
The CUT never fails to impress. We took out parents and in-laws for a special occasion dinner. The quality of the ingredients, the presentation and of course the taste of the meal was impeccable. Having visited several times, I can say with confidence that their quality and experience is always consistent - excellent. Of course you pay for this and I have heard it said around Singapore that it is "overpriced". I disagree. I am willing to pay for the consistency and quality. We had starters (the pork belly with julienned apple on top is really special). The mussels were very fresh and plentiful and everyone at the table (8 of us) were impressed by them. Main course was a selection of wagyu as well as a couple tomahawks along with multiple side dishes. The japanese wagyu was the consensus favorite and the macaroni and cheese side didn't last long.Another fantastic meal and will definitely return
5
Being a Michelin star restaurant, this restaurant offer quite a good value for money. The steak is what you expected from a top chef, good quality, well cooked and finely served. So, there's n doubt in that area.What i wanted to highlight are the appetizers and other non-steak menus. They're all good. we try the big eye tuna tartare and Prawn cocktail and both were amazing! complex and yet balance taste. Recommended
5
Walked in there a sceptic. Came out a believer. It is as good as they say it is. I had the USDA rib eye, cooked how med rare should be. Wifey had the pork chop. I was actually more impressed with the pork chop than me steak. Not easy to get pork right. Get the Souffle for dessert, thank me later. Not a cheap dinner by any stretch but for my birthday i deserve it.
5
Had a business dinner here and this place deserves its rating. Was a little unsure because if you Google this, Google seems to think this is a casual dining place which it is most definitely not. The first thing you notice in this place are the stark Hollywood portraits on the walls / menus etc., a reference to where this place comes from perhaps, but it’s quite a statement and sets the tone well. The restaurant is loud and busy which I like, but not so loud you need to shout to be heard, there is a good ambience. Dining is very comfortable, not stuffy in the slightest, and the serving staff are very friendly. The steak is very good, but everything else was tasty too – including the very nice selection of breads. I’d definitely return.
5
The quality of the steak is out of this world. Even without the gravy, you just need salt and pepper to enjoy the steak. Great service and ambiance, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I went there for my wedding anniversary, and they gave me a complementary dessert free of charge.Price likewise is a bit steep, however, it is expected when you have a meal of such quality. The only thing to take note of is, the portion of the steak itself. We under-estimate the situation and ordered 2 prime rib, it was huge !! My wife could only finish half of her share and I ended up eating almost 500 grams of meat that day...Great experience, definitely will come back again for special occasions
5
Simply amazing! We heard of the great reviews for this restaurant so we had to try it. The wait/service staff were very professional, friendly and helpful throughout the night, and our wait staff Sandra provided great advice when we asked for recommendations. The wine choice was vast and our selection of an S.B was divine. The food from top to bottom was amazing and our choice of Wagyu steak was the best thing I've eaten in my life, and I'm not exaggerating. Yes, expensive but as they say you get what you pay for and I'm not likely to be able to spend like this again, so we are glad to have experienced this venue, and can highly recommend visiting here - it's worth it
5
No surprise, quality comes with a price. As close to USA beef quality that you will get in Singapore. Red wines also pair nice. Good service also.
5
Pricey steak but definitely worth a visit. Best steak we ever had.
Try one of the marvellous desserts if you still got appetite
4
Popular and not cheap but this is one of the better steak houses in town. The bar is also popular and they have some great cocktails. Don't expect to come here for a cheap meal though
5
Was there yesterday on a quiet evening. Lovely hostesses at the door and great attention to order-taking. Generous servings and the sirloin I had was perfect. Loved my visit.
5
The price is expensive but the food, the wine are totally worth it, Steak is delicious. the only thing is not that good is you have a book way in advanced or you will end up like me to have dinner around 10pm
3
This place is mainly meat n specialises in steak. The steak is Cooked in its own flavour n rather charred looking - which I know it's their signature. The steak doesn't come with any sides and one have to order them. Expect to pay about 120-150 Per pax if you order the entry level steak. However for the more expensive cut, it's about 200 per pax without drinks n sides.The ambience is not the greatest and they do not have table cloth on their tables. The Service is average though you get seated and served swiftly
4
i been in cut last week to try their famous steaks and i was not deluded. i got a reservation in the bar section because i was alone but i had a very nice conversation with the bartender. i got a very tasty negroni (they used tanqueray jin) and i star my dinner experience. absolutely tasty; the appetizer was a wagyu tartare with aioli and dijon sauce with crunchy bread. The taste was very nice and the two sauce gave something more. after i got a very juicy and tasty stake sirloin from american wagyu with pure': as usual cut dosen't make me disappointed. The stake was cocked perfectly and the pure' was really amazing and balanced. as dessert i got a souffle' that was so big that i cannot finish.Recommended
5
We booked here for dinner as part of our honeymoon and what a treat it was. Food was outstanding. The best steak we have ever had. You will never leave hungry!!Staff were pleasant and attentive to your ever need. We cannot fault them.Yes this restaurant is expensive but you et what you pay for and it was worth every single penny
5
Being a Beef afficiando..couldnt have asked for a better place.pricey and expensive, well once a while to indulge is not bad. The breads, the cheesy sticks yes to start with kept offering and we kept eating was outstanding. The New york sirloin ordered medium to well done with the in-house steak sauce and fries portion cud have fed at least six people was simply outstanding Def a visit next time in Singapor
5
We recently visited this restaurant, and whilst expecting it would be good it far surpassed that we went straight into the steaks no starters (not necessary) we had Ribeye and a New York Strip - the Ribeye has to be one of the best I have ever had ( and trust me I have eaten loads !!) the NYS was up there to, so my advice would be to go in fairly hungry as you get absolutely loads of high quality food
4
Apart from the very chic interior, the steak is truly to die for!!! It's tender, cooked to perfection & massive!!! Yummy!!!
5
Fantastic food, a must for any meat lover! The service is very friendly and accommodating, steaks were absolutely perfect - unfortunately the wines are on the expensive side.
5
This Restaurant deserves to be No1 in the Steak business. The food is excellent and the steaks amazing in taste and texture.
The Manager Ruben is running this place perfectly.
4
Ambience is nice and the staff were accommodating. You need to reserve in advance though coz its always fully booked.
3
Definitely need booking in this restaurant. Music is too loud for fine dining, probably most of their patrons were talking and laughing loudly. Service was good though as waiter keeps checking if everything was ok. Beef was done nicely.
5
We love cows. Now only for milk and cheese, but also for their delicious meat. CUT has it done in so many ways, but what we want really is the meat. The chefs here really know what they're doing. I'm sure if we take a peep into the kitchen, you'll see the chefs singing to the steak cos they appear on our plates so happy and ready for us to eat. The price may be a bit out of the norm, but hey, this is one luxury meat lovers must experience, NOW
5
Betond expectations!!! Celebrity dining!!! Fabulous ambiance! Incredible decor! fantastic beyond wors service & staff!!! Awsome coctails!!! As far as the steaks..????? As soft as a mashmallow!!! Soooooo bloody yummy....not only tastewise but also the presentation.... One of the worldwide celeb awarded restaurants in the world you cannot miss..... Singapore rocks with cut!!

Ordered 1. maple glazed pork belly 2. black kale 3. spinach with egg 4. 2 glasses of wine 5. tasting sampler (meat, 250SGD), 6. fillet min from USA 7. Apple crumble 8. Still water.Only the Japanese A5 wagyu was good. The other two were a little tough. Beef, when cooked right, should be juicy and tender even when well-done. We had all our steaks medium-well. The fillet min was ok. Black kale (18$ or $24, I can't remember) was a touch bitter and just a disappointment. Some pieces of the pork belly were a little crispy and some were not. If it was supposed to be crispy, then I can only say that the chef did a sloppy job. The whole bill was 690SGD. Emmanuel, our server, was good. The place had the vibe of a loud American diner; not good for anniversaries, birthdays or first dates.Personally, I feel that Cut does not deserve any Michelin stars
4
Very nice ambience and the food is good, a bit expensive but worth it. Service is attentive and couteous. Try the Coq Au Vin, tasty chicken french dish. A really cosy place to dine with friends, though toddlers may not be comfortable. Cut is ideally located at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sand which is superb for shopping and entertainment
5
I had dinner here to celebrate our anniversary. We had a beautiful dinner and the steaks were superb. Wonderfully charred on top with medium rare perfection. I eat steaks regularly and it's really great to be pleasantly surprised when a place actually lives up to its reputation. Something very hard to do in today's day and age
5
three of us ordered everything from the steaks to the lamb , side dishes and desserts. I am a difficult eater but cannot find fault with anything that we tasted it was really that good.
5
One of the best places I have ever tried. A bit pricy as almost everything in Singapore.
Very good service. Staff are all well informed about the food and drinks in the place and they are so friendly.
4
A variety of sides, sauces for your selection. Portion for sides are pretty big portion like onion rings , mussels, fries could share among 4pax each of those. Ordered filet mignon ordered a choice of sauce but think I can go without it because it is quite tasty by itself. Beef Sliders as sides or bar snacks was fantastic . Had 3 types of desserts from the menu can be shared as well all are good nothing is not nice there:) It is not as expensive as you thought probably order wisely of what you can eat should keep within cost. Make sure you get a Rough Love their signature cocktail 
1
Pretentious and over priced especially since the food was mediocre at best.We had four different main courses of which the sirloin was the worst dish. It was tough and tasteless. This was a medium rare order. Steaks are easy to marinate. A simple salt and pepper rub is enough to bring out the lovely flavour of a good cut. However they did not even manage this.The other three dishes are not worth the mention hut at least more enjoyable than the steak.
3
Firstly the whole restaurant is so poorly lit (very dim) that it was so difficult to read the menu. My Order was correct, hence the Average rating but my hubby's & daughter's were wrong. We suspected something was wrong when the food was served.. meat cuts were not as good as our 1st visit, very average. The service staff though seemingly polite were not very attentive & seemed very SMUG about themselves .. Our server didn't even repeat our order back to us. We were terribly disappointed 
4
Very good ambience for a night out with friends. Not really a place to bring small kids. We brought our kids and the restaurant staff tried to make our stay as comfortable for the kids as possible.Limited choices on the menu. Steak was of course very good. But it becomes a bit rubbery when it gets cold. So make sure to eat it as soon as it is served.Very good service by the staff
4
I've been only once to the restaurant for dinner and I don't see any reason to do it again. The food is good, no question about it, but it's really not special enough that would motivate a higher price level than most other top resurants offering high quality meats. Go to Luke's or Burnt Ends instead for great meat.What IS good however is the bar! Cut is a beautiful venue and their bar employs some great bartenders and also offers fantastic bar food. Best beef sliders in town!I give the restaurant 3 stars for it's low value for money. I give the bar 5 stars for great staff, dirnks and food.=> 4 stars
5
CUT is exactly as you would expect, some of the worlds best steak, great service and a top night. It's not however somewhere to visit if you're on a budget.We ordered the American Wagyu filet minion and rib eye steaks - both were cooked to perfection (as ordered). We added the Mac and Cheese and a spinach dish, which was plenty for two to share. We hadn't bothered with starters as we expected the mains would be enough. All the staff we encountered were friendly and only too willing to help. The wait for food and drinks wasn't long despite it being a busy Saturday night and when they heard we were on part of our Honeymoon they surprised us with a complimentary dessert with a congratulations message. Great meal and great restaurant. Dinner for two with wine and the odd cocktail or two was around s$700. NB - CUT isn't actually in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, it's located in the Shoppes at Marina Bay opposite - we didn't realise this until we arrived.
5
Went with friends for a dinner before the show. Service is very professional and reminds me of those premium restaurants in the US. They could be a little more genuine, though. Otherwise, it will all feel so pretentious.CUT's setting is rather dark, very modern --- it feels a lot like dinner clubs in NYC. All in all, nice place to hang-out after work with friends or colleagues. Kids or family? Maybe not so.We ordered bigeye tuna tartare and the Alaskan King Crab and Shrimp Louis as appetizers. Both are nicely cooked, but my preference is the Louis because of the spicy tomato-horseradish sauce.My main course is the 100% Wagyu Hokkaido Snow Beef filet mignon. Taste very nice, and luckily I ordered the filet mignon which is only 120g. Too big portion of wagyu/kobe/matsuzaka beef usually make you feel stuffy very quickly. Smaller size means just nice. Too excited to eat this until I forgot to take picture of the beef!Net, this is a good place to go for premium beef if you don't care about the price. Price is rather steep --- $250 for the beef and $22-41 for each appetizer dish, before GST and service charge. This is why I always cherish my visit to Steak House Satou in Kichijoji --- much better value
5
This is the restaurant I had my first dish of bone marrow. Sounds horrible to me, but turned out it's so so... delicious. The sauces is just perfect to go with the fatty bone marrow. But never feel too filling. Heard from one commented that it's even better than the Michelin star restaurant, L'Atelier De Joel Robuchon. Frankly eben though it's so good, it's best to share with two so that it's less guilty and you cld try other dishes. Other starter, crab meat and avocado is refreshing. Steak and the sides is excellent, i especially like the stir fried mushroom here. Always wanted to come back again m again
4
If you like meat you will be in heaven, the menu is really expensive so don't bother going with a vegetarian friend or a fish lover. The atmosphere is fantastic and you could bet you are in NYC meat packing district; however go early as it is a dead scene after 10pm. Not so NYC then
5
We were staying in Singapore for two nights. By far the best meal I ate whilst here. I'm such a foodie and living in London there is such an abundance of great restaurants. Saying that, this has to be one of my favourite meals ever. The waiters were fantastic, very attentive but not over bearing. The food was cooked to perfection and the wine was amazing! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough! Thank you everybody at Cut, you made my journey to Singapore very memorable!
5
Firstly, we spent S$700 per person at this restaurant but as a steak house this has got to be one of the best In the world. The dry aged beef was perfection! And the waygu was out of this world. Cocktails too were fun and exciting, the rough love cocktail was sublime! This restaurant is most ideal for fun business discussions or romantic date
4
This premier steak house boasts a Michelin star, offers absolutely fantastic steak and has a wine list to match. The US Wagyu ribeye was the best I have had in 30 years of fine business steak dinners (New York included). The six cheese choices were limited but pleasant. The chocolate soufflé was decadently rich, true to its Valrhona name. The enjoyment of our business dinner was greatly enhanced by Raj our sommelier once he assumed responsibility for all aspects of the superb service experience. So how much are you willing to pay for such an experience? Clearly a lot....but maybe an average of S$400 a head is over the top.
5
Robust atmosphere with perfectly tuned background music and multiple conversations.Service is one of the best if not the best in any restaurant in Asia.Bread offerings were freshly baked and delicious.The steaks were cooked to perfection. Had the rib-bone in and tomahawk to share among 4 hungry people. Steaks reasonably priced for the location and service.Cons - strictly no BYO, even with offer of corkage coverage. Nice selection of wines but overpriced. You can net a nice grand cru classe at the merchant for a bottle of mid level aussie shiraz listed here
4
We didn't make a reservation, but the front-of-house were great in informing us that we could be seated inside but have to leave by a certain time or we could sit at the lounge area.We got the sample plate because we didn't know which we liked best. We must say that we don't regret the hefty price! The steak were well-cooked and we really enjoyed it. We left with a bit of a meat coma but it was a good way to remember the dining experience.The staff were friendly and made sure our water was regularly topped up. They were attentive as well. Thank you

We had dinner here for a special occasion recently. We had the sweet white corn soup which is a seasonal item on the menu. It was really delicious.For main my husband had the double pork chop and I had the Hokkaido Snow Wagyu beef ribeye. We ordered 3 sides - tempura onion rings, potato and broccolini.They were all good but portion sizes are way too big. The Wagyu beef wasn't too big but it's too rich that by the time you get through it, it's a bit too much. I think it was 170 grams which costs SGD320++ so not finishing it wasn't an option.Wine is super expensive. A glass of brut champagne is SGD40++ and SGD60++ for rose champagne.Service is good.Overall, I'd still rate it as a good experience but I really think they overcharge for the wines. And I understand their specialty is meat but portions could be a little bit smaller

Made an advance booking two weeks before Cut was listed with Michelin one star. Design is nice although the restaurant is a bit noisy (for fine dining) with punk style music and diners talking. Service is good. Ordered a bottle of wine, scallop carpaccio and pork belly as starters, American wagyu rib eye and pork chop for mains, wild mushroom and onion rings as sides, chocolate soufflés for dessert. Food is good, especially the scallop carpaccio - fresh taste of scallop with a east-meet-west fusion kind of sauce. Wagyu beef is also very good. The onion rings are deliciously crispy and nice. Chocolate soufflé has a rich chocolate taste, super sinful. Not cheap but worth a nice evening out

I have never had a better steak in my life! And I have been to many of the best restaurants around the world. Who would have ever guessed one would find something so special in Singapore of all places. We tried a variation of steaks offered, from the lowest priced ones to the highest, all were exceptional. This place is so we'll run, they treated us extremely well, kudos to all the staff. Truly worth every dollar spent. Might not be the best place if you are watching your waist, all the side dishes are amazing as well. I'm looking forward to my next Cut of beef. Five very deserving stars!!

3rd visit and service was still stellar & super attentive. Had Cream spinach, mac & cheese, "snow" wagyu, & a pandan dessert which looked like a durian. All amazing. You will never find a dessert like this anywhere and it's something which makes an impression on both the mind and palate. There were sauce options on the menu but please don't add or use any sauce on your steak, it's seasoned perfectly you do not even need to reach for the salt. The flavour of the meat itself is so good on its own. There are interesting variety of sauces but resist the urge. Ordered the usual 2 cocktails shiso and lavender. Both were good but not as amazing as the past 2 visits, kind of lacked the usual depth in flavour. The shiso honey one had too intense shiso flavour it tasted almost like a mojito as though it had lots of mint leaves. The lavender one did not taste anything like the one i had the past 2 times but it's still palatable.The best place for steak, cream spinach & impecable service

Modern chic atmosphere, wasn't there for dinner so no comment on the food, but lovely cocktails and dessert, the friendly service, which is a surprise for fine dining restaurant, it made up a beautiful evening.
5
Very good food offered, excellent service, it's fine dinning. Service were very nice explaining the dishes serve. Will go back for more.
5
Service was excellent, though the table next to me was rowdy and loud. the cocktails are absolutely delicious (and strong!), beef was delicious. The price was a little steep.
5
I've been there lots of times. It's all perfect, service, ambience, food, wine. Steaks and wine always our favorites. It's really fine dinning in all aspects. Price point is expensive but worth every penny. They also have a pre show menu, which is great when you have a ticket to the theater by the side

Went for professional dinner. For the bargain price of $750 we got fed. First I'm not a fan of restaurants thinking it is OK to charge for your Steak and not bother to give you sides. I mean really how much to vegetables cost that you cant put them on the plate, instead you have to pay $20-30 each for some potatoes. Apart from that I was excited to eat the steak. I ordered my steak 9it was the porterhouse (for 2). I think it was $200 from memory. It takes at least forty minutes (I eat it rare so that was quite a wait), then when it comes they brought the wrong steak. They brought a bone in Rib Fillet. I said 'that's not what I ordered" and the waiter said yes you did. I reiterated. He then checked his little piece paper (yes he used a piece of paper in 5 star restaurant but I digress) and realised he had made an error. He stands and looks at me. I look back with a questioning look on my face but say nothing. he then says, "well do you want it". Ummm let me think $200 for a steak that I didn't order hows about NO. So he petulantly takes it back and then ANOTHER half an hour later the steak I actually ordered comes out. I am trying to be objective in my assessment of the steak (as you can imagine my experience had been somewhat soured at this point) but to be honest it wasn't brilliant. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty nice but I wanted it to blow me away and it just didn't. the cut was nice, it was cooked perfectly, it was presented really well and the flavour was pretty good but I have significantly better for much less. So all in all for $700+ for a meal for two people, I was decidedly underwhelmed
5
Though it can be a bit pricey, but for the price you pay, you can get unlimited assorted types of bread, steaks of prime cut. I had the pork chop and it was delicious. The other friends had lamb rack and steaks, and they all said they tasted really good
5
Celebrated our anniversary there and was surprised by a specially arranged semi private table and complimentary dessert. Service was pleasant and attentive!We know the portions would be huge so we had the dry aged ribeye and shared some starters and sides. Ribeye was tender and starters and sides were delicious. Everything goes well with champange! Pricey but worth the splurge
5
a truly amazing steak, one of the best I have had anywhere in the world. Great choice of wine and good service.Overall a great experience but be prepared to 'pay for it' It is expensive but if you like one of the best steaks you will have ever tasted then it is for you!
5
The best steak house I visited in Singapore.I love everything from the bread, salad, main, dessert and wine/beer!The point is their service is excellent and there are surprises in every dishes we tried.This is the 4th time I came since I tried last year.But of course, only on special occasions. And Cut really make it special
2
We got a heap of vouchers from friends for our wedding and used them at this restaurant. Big mistake. We ordered the second cheapest steak on the menu ($94!) it came with no sides so we ordered chips $18 and broccoli $18. The steak was dry and tasteless. We mentioned this to our waiter and got an insincere apology. This restaurant is too expensive for its offerings. The atmosphere was non existent, more a business atmosphere. We don't mind paying for quality but on this occasion it was sadly lacking.
5
One of my "must to stop" places in Singapore. Now it is even starred .... Wonderful scenario, good food and wine ... A must place . Sure ... It is singapore.... So don't expect cheap bill
5
The best steakhouse that I have ever been to. There you have a huge selection of choices of different steaks. The service in the restaurant is also very good. Sometimes the restaurant can be full, so make sure you have a reservation.
5
Had a great evening at Cut with friends last month. Fantastic steak and great wine and service. A bit pricey, so for the treat.
4
I like the food, ambience and service is this restaurant.
Every small aspect is looked into.
Recommended place and will certainly come back again.
5
It was a amazing business dinner , unbelievable food , service was impeccable
Staff was friendly , less choice in menu but what they have is one of the best , you will not find any where
4
This is very upmarket and very pricey.Surprising that's it's in a shopping mall and you look into the mall but the decor is excellent.Service was excellent as expected and the fillet on the bone was top class tender as was the New York strip.sides at 28 $ are really pricey and the kale and spinach side is excellent.A great night and come prepared to spend happily otherwise look elsewhere for 2 with one starter and 4 drinks 500$ ouch
5
Cut is expensive. Paying 500 per person for a meal is a tad on the pricy side. But all things considered Singapore is an expensive city.The steaks ate hands down the best I have tied in my life. And the ambiance is second to none. The only let down is the extremely poor lighting.
3
Despite all the hype around his name and brand, this is an average restaurant experience, largely affected by the noise and lack of atmosphere. You get the sense you are sitting in Times Sq or Picaddilly Circus as everything is rushed. Steaks are ok, but being from S Africa, don't compare to the local offering. Given it's prices, we had one bottle of their house wine, which was very good, GPB 260 for two is on the high side. Give it a miss, much better options in this foodies paradise
5
Food and service are all great! We (two persons) each had a serving of Miaygi Perfecture and a couple of sides. Steak was excellent. Mac and cheese side is one of the best that we have had. The bread was great too. Service was excellent. U never have to wave for attention! Definitely worth the splurge! (Sorry the picture of the steak is not well taken due to insufficient lighting)
4
Attended an investor function event, in one of their private room. Appetiser had salad which is unique and fresh, main course is salmon fish, that was fantastic! Well, dessert is average.( forgot the dishes name, attached with photos)Atmosphere is fine, when we left around 9pm restaurant still crowded. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner I will not suggest here. Is more suitable for business or simply just to enjoy the food...I heard the steak is nice too~~
5
Probably the best steak I have ever eaten. Still getting used to world class restaurants being found in shopping centres... The service, wine list and bill all as high end as expected. Look forward to going back!
5
Are you intending to have dinner in nice place with staff so polite, this is the place to be. Food is amazing try Beef and desert.
5
i was here for dinner wiv my frens total 5 persons.from de moment we go in their service was great & attentive.de selection of food & wine was awesome. not reli into their dessert due sweetness
4
everything was on high level: USDA Prime NY Sirloin med-rare, crab salad, and deserts... but no personal touch (contrary to Morton's I visited yesterday).
very good/extensive wine list, esp. reds from all over the world; but toneless espresso, well, maybe because it was decaf.
5
I've been stuck in Myanmar for 8 months and was craving a good steak. We came to Cut, and were overwhelmed with how good the steaks were. I had the sample plate which consisted of an American Prime NY Strip, American Wagyu NY strip, and a Japanese Wagyu NY strip. All were cooked to perfection (medium rare), and were amazing. The American Wagyu was my favorite. We also had the Scallop Carpaccio, which was excellent, as was the Pork Belly. This place is excellent, just be prepared to pay top dollar for your meal.
5
My brother and I were around the Marina Bay Sands area and we fancied a steak. He suggested we see if Cut by Wolfgang Puck had any tables free. The concierge lady phoned the restaurant and informed us that they had space on a first come first served basis in the lounge.No problem! we made our over and was seated at a table by the bar.I ordered the USDA sirloin and what a wonderful piece of meat I was given! We also had mac & cheese and creamed spinach sides. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. And I really do mean perfection. The meal itself, rates in my top 5 meals I've had.Would recommend highly
2
A total disappointment! Maybe this restaurant is not cut out for group reservations. Maybe they don't have enough man power but a shame, if you cannot cater to a big group, do not take the reservation cos this is only going to kill your brand name. In my long table of 14 people, most people ordered steak (mignon, rib eye). How one judges the taste of food, apart from an individual liking, much depends if the food has been finished. More than 50% of steak were left untouched by 50% of the people on that table. It was either too cooked when a medium rare was ordered and it tasted too salty. I cannot believe what I put in my mouth when most reviews speak highly of a place like this. The service was an ok. For the price and standard of the restaurant, much is expected. It was a total disappointment and definitely will not go back. Maybe because we are a group too big for the restaurant to manage.
5
From the minute you arrive, the service is exceptional and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Excellent menu, really well explained and a very pleasant change to be advised not to each order sides as more than enough to share - absolutely right!The food is incredible, the bread is fabulous and takes great control not to fill up on it!! No question, best steak we've ever eaten (had the Japanese and Australian wagyu), cooked to perfection. Starters were also excellent and yes, we even managed to squeeze in a dessert each!!! The staff were asking about our holiday and I mentioned my son's graduation and when they brought his dessert they had piped on congratulation messages - which was lovely.Expensive, of course! But it is rare treat to enjoy a meal of this quality, in great surroundings and with such friendly and attentive staff
3
I knew this was going to be a hard hit on the wallet but in a country where S$10 can still buy you a complete meal you need to feel that you got value for money.As you can tell, I don't think we did. Steak, salmon etc all were cooked beautifully and all served with accompanying veg as one would expect but in the end the absurdly scaled cheque undermined our deligh
5
Excellent steak, mussels ( seasonal) , onion rings. Don't over order first as they have one of the best breads around! Amazing cocktails... Such as Rough Love, crouching tiger, dance naked. Share with the friendly bar tenders what you like and they can concoct a surprise for you. Thumbs up! Brilliant service from the reception, bar and servers...u definitely don't need to keep waving to get attention. Very glad we have this 5 star establishment in SG. It's not often we get such quality and consistently good restaurant.
5
One word..... PERFECT! Food, ambiance, staff, music, drinks. Truly amazing experience. Would always recommend this restaurant to everyone!
5
I've been a long time admirer of Chef Puck so it was a dream come true to be able to dine here. Everthing about my meal there was absolutely perfect - from the wine recommendation to the steak platter that we sampled to the dessert!
5
Excellent food, one of the best steak i've ever tasted in the world. Excellent service and excellent wine. A very must visit. Worth the price
5
CUT lives up to its reputation in serving the best steak I have ever tried. We came in a group of 4 and ordered a wagyu, porterhouse and prime sirloin. All were done to perfection, cut and served that made it easy for us to share. The two side portions were huge.The wine list was very extensive. Service was impeccable, attentive but not intrusive. Not cheap but worth every cent. Will be back surely
5
As the slogan often says "You gotta eat here!"A very elegant and serene restaurant in the midst of a mad shopping centre, tasteful décor and great service make for a very enjoyable dinning experience.The food is simply superb, from the tiny cornbread biscuits, to the soft warm focaccia, every detail is executed with precision. The mashed potato was simply the best I ever had. I am always a little dubious of Celebrity Chef chain restaurants, but this one was fantastic, great food and good service, thoroughly recommended
5
CUT is definitely the best restaurant in Singapore! Marilou and Rugis are absolutely amazing. They were attentive, humorous and made excellent menu suggestions. This is not the first time I have been to CUT, but the first time I have ever left a Tripadvisor review. Kudos to your amazing team and in particular Marilou for your excellent memory. 4 years on and she still remembers my orders AND the watches I have worn!
5
This restaurant is just fabulous! We wandered past one day and decided to book for the next night. The service was immaculate and the food was just so delicious! I was proud to see Aussie steak as the main attractions - which of course I couldn't bear to choose (cause I can have that at home!). We were very pleased with our choice, and even though the meals are quite substantial, they talked us in to dessert - the most delicious and beautifully presented chocolate souffle we have ever had! This is a must-do restuarnt, we would even plan a trip back to Singapore just to eat here again! But, we'll skip a meal beforehand so we can fit everything in! :-
5
We opted for the early, pre-theatre menu and it did not disappoint. The Alaskan Crab and Shrimp salad for starter was really tasty, with generous chunks of crab meat. The Hanger steak for main was cooked perfectly and the tempura batter onion rings were the best I have had. It was a bit pricey, but not considering where you are!
5
We had very high expectations coming to this restaurant and we were not disappointed! This has to be one of the most memorable meals of our travels. The restaurant is a carnivores dream! We enjoyed every single item we ordered, from the cocktails to the starters (the bone marrow flan is to die for), the steaks and the dessert. Service was impeccable. An evening at Cut is well worth the spend and when next in Singapore we will visit again
5
What more would you expect from world famous Wolfgang Puck, except perfection?!From the starters to mains, and even the dessert, my meal was immaculately prepared and my New York Sirloin steak has got to be the meal of my life. Never have I ever tasted steak that was prepared so well, that I really took my time to savour every mouthful.For starters, I highly recommend (if available) the Bone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad. I also had the Maple Glazed Pork Belly, Fuji Apple-Yali Pear Salad, Sesame–Orange Dressing which left me wanting more.Even my desserts were a real treat. The restaurant has managed to infuse some local flavours into its offerings. I had a Kaya Baked Alaska, which was a delight! Also recommended is Warm Butterscotch Apple Crumble.You pay for what you get, but you really need to treat yourself... don't miss out on this
4
We stopped off here after dinner one night. The wine and cocktail list is amazing. I tried the London calling! Spectacular gin, Cointreau, elderflower and orange blossom. The bar seating is nice and cosy. The restaurant was packed and buzzing
5
I ate at this restaurant last January. I enjoyed, literally, the best rib eye I have ever eaten in my life. It was that good. Highly recommend it. Bring your wallet.
5
We had one our most amazing restaurant experiences at cut. The food and service was just world-class. The chef was also kind enough to prepare something basic that was not on the menu for our 4-year old son.
5
Located in the shopping centre off the Marina Bay Sands hotel the restaurant is really nice a very beautiful mood and ambience the staff were all exceptional and engaging although its fancy they made us feel welcome and comfortable. The cocktail list is extensive and delicious with a cool bar area. Although this is high end spend wise it was really worth it - go treat yoursel
5
We chose Cut by Wolfgang Puck to celebrate my wife's birthday. Restaurant service was excellent, especially by Marilou. We ordered 1 USDA prime sirloin and USDA prime ribeye. The steaks are tender and juicy, and the smokey char grilled taste made it even more interesting matched with a nice red wine sauce. The wild mushroom with green chillies was a really good side dish and had some oriental taste to it... Will definitely come back 
5
I echo the majority opinion of people who eat here. Definitely amongst the top steaks we have ever eaten. A good selection of selection of cuts and place of origin for the steaks.The staff are highly knowledgable and superbly trainedEverything from the breads to the starters and deserts was delicious. Highly recommend
5
As we arrived too early at the Restaurant we had to wait for 20 minutes for our table. We took a Bloody Mary at the bar-the bartender is world class and as the selection of the Vodkas for the BM. The food was amazing as well later later. Top selection of Steaks and sides are amazing my favorite were the mashed truffled potatoes and the onion rings. The wine selection is huge we decided to take an Austrian wine-from the home of Wolfgang Puck and it was a great choice. Great experience - Lucky S'pore to have a restaurant like this
5
Awesome Restaurant in Marina Bay Sands Hotel.The service was amazing and the staff was very nice and helpful.We had Rib Eye steak and Sirloin Steak.The side dishes we great too (mac n cheese - potatoes)A bit expensive but worth the money.Highly recommende
5
My husband and I have been dining at Cut for over a year and a half. ( yes! I should have rated them long ago but no excuses this week) Without a doubt, it is the BEST place for steaks in Singapore. The atmosphere is lively, warm and welcoming! We dine here as a couple, with our teenage children for family celebrations, with friends or with Business Associates. Just recently in May, my husband and I were there on 2 occasions. The food and cocktails ( our favorite are Sweet Little Lie and Yakuza) have always been consistently good! What makes it more special is the friendliness, warmth and efficiency of the staff, led by GM PAUL JOSEPH. Paul and his wonderful team always take the effort to come round to check if we are doing ok. Thank you for making this a special place for us! We will be back soon! Bett
5
I went to CUT after reading the reviews on tripadvisor, and it was by far the best steak Ive ever had! The restaurant is in the Marina Shopping Mall and the service was superb, very attentive.I had the USA Wagyu fillet which was extremely tender and succulent. Cooked to perfection!Yes the price was expensive for a steak but you are eating one of the most expensive cuts, in a Michelin star restaurant. It was the best meal of our holiday and I would certainly go again if I went back to Singapore.The sides come in big portions, so you may only need one or two. We had the apple crumble for dessert, which again was extremely tasty.Overall a superb steak house which is expensive but in my eyes, worth every penny! (and the rest!
5
it is expensive but in fairness, I think you get what you pay for. We go on special occasions and are always impressed with the food, cocktails and service generally.
5
Had a wonderful time at CUT by Wolfgang Puck. The food was exceptional, but credits goes to Marilou for making the evening especially memorable for us as she surprised us with birthday treats for me and my girl!
5
My family and I had dinner at the CUT to celebrate two events: one, the graduation of my son from Singapore Management University; and two, his birthday. I made an online reservation with a note that this is going to be a special night given the dual celebration. The dinner was superb. We had all the best tasting steaks - wagyu, kobe, USDA prime, etc. We had wine of course to go with it. Fabulous. We were actually choosing from among Ruth's Chris, Morton's of Chicago and CUT. But since we've tasted Morton's in where else, Chicago of course, and Ruth's Chris in LA, we went for CUT in Singapore. Our expectations were met. It's pricey of course but it was not an issue because we were celebrating milestones. And by the way, the chef prepared a special dessert for my son as a congratulatory gesture and a birthday greeting as well. Thoughtful

Decided to try this restaurant after reading an article where it was mentioned as ine of the most likely to receive a star in the Michelin Guide. To put it simply; if this restaurant is rewarded by Michelin they can really close down all of the Michelin Guide. the service and table managment here was not even close to being worthy of such a reward. arrived on time, was asked to take a place at the bar for 5 min as the table was not ready. 25 min. later we made a comment about it, was again told 5 min. Then once they are ready got the worst table in the house where we could barely fit in the table. this is not a way to run a restaurant where you aim to be in the michelin.
5
Was looking for a dinner place which was decent without a crazy long wait (it was the night of the Cap America Premiere); and Cut was as far as my feet would take me at that point. The hostess was pleasant enough even though I did not have a reservation. Marilou was our server that evening that was great at accommodating my dad and I's needs - we were looking for a 'light dinner' so she recommended a balanced menu (since I had to limit my gluten intake, and read meat intake - yes I was in a steak house) so we started with a refreshing Louis Salad (with seafood) and a Roast Chicken (which was enough to share for two persons). Overall bill came to S$161.25 with 2 mocktails
5
We pre booked a few days before and it was well worth it as we were given one of the best tables in the house in a nice secluded area.Having eaten at many cuts around the world this rated as one of the best, on par with LA.Usual excellent quality of service, good food and razzmatazz as every course is served in its own theatrical unique way.The steak was cooked to perfection and so tasty as was the whole chicken with a jus to die for.The pea soup starter was incredible, it tasted really fresh and looked and so pretty.As for dessert we had the perfect chocolate soufflé to share, it was light and fluffy and we would highly recommend it even if, like us, you think you are too full! Yes it's quite a pricey restaurant but defo worth it - treat yourselves!

I have visited this restaurant only a few times but I’d say all of those visits have been so far, satisfactory! Service is superb. Staffs are very accommodating and friendly. You can be sure that you’ll leave the place having the feeling that you have been served really really well ☺ As for the food and drinks... Well, one of the bests. For the cocktails, two of my favorites are “dance naked” and “the full frontal” These two, I promise ☺ are veryyyy good! Food per se, I recommend… STARTERS – “Steak Tartare – this is a must try!!!”, “Mustard Bone Marrow Flan”, “Tosa Soy Kaluga Caviar – this is a must try!!!” and “Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio” MAINS – “Colorado Lamb Chops” and “American Wagyu Rib Eye Steak 280g” On the side – their “Mashed Potato” is to die for! DESSERT – “Warm Butterscotch Apple Crumble” Last but not the least, WINE. This is a matter of preference I believe. For me, I’d always go for red & dry. And before I forget, ambiance is of course nothing but top notch
5
Simply great steak !!! This is one of the more popular restaurants in Singapore and for good reasons. The steak is cooked to perfection as you would expect at this Signature Chef restaurant. The wine list is extensive and the service spot on. Just make sure you have upped your limit on your credit card before dining here.

I was disappointed with the food. I wanted the edges of the steak to have some crispiness on the fat, but it was soggy. I expected to beef to have a rich complex flavor like Morton's, but it just tasted like a regular piece of meat. The flavor combinations of the recipes were very traditional/predictable, which is good, but it meant that the celebrity chef's creativity couldn't rescue the poor execution.The table wasn't leveled on the floor and kept rocking when somebody would lean on the table.We arrived very hungry when the restaurant opened, but the servers were so oriented toward getting lots of tables started that they paid no attention to the tables they already had. We wanted to get drinks and order appetizers quickly, but we couldn't get any service beyond menus and water for more than 20 minutes of our stay. It was surreal to be raising our hands and signaling for service while a dozen servers scurried around the room without looking.Overall the servers were extremely polite, to the point of being obsequious, but they didn't actually DO anything besides brown-nose and follow a robotic routine. They came at certain intervals to check on us and to refill water, but unfortunately those appearances turned out to be exactly the opposite of when we needed a server. When our glasses were empty, nobody came. We signaled, nobody saw us. When we were deep in an important conversation, they interrupted us to give a speech about beef cuts. The staff give memorized speeches about the food, but when we asked questions, it was clear they didn't know anything that wasn't in the speech
5
Exceptional food quality and certainly a great place for meat lovers. The homemade bread selection (something I pay a lot of attention too as it is the first indication of a great restaurant) was outstanding. The salad with avocado, blue cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette was extremely refreshing. Hardly anything beats a great, perfectly cooked and flavorful steak but when you get served French purple grape mustard with it, you're in heaven. The service has made my experience finally a remarkable one....very friendly, efficient and experienced. The only point that needs improvement is the light in the back area of the restaurant, it is a touch too dark. Would definitely return
5
Very good food in Cut by Wolfgang Puck. The price is expensive but very high quality. Service was great and staffs were friendly!!
4
Fantastic private dining room at the rear of the restaurant, floor to ceiling glass that doubled at the wine cellar. Food and service was on the spot - steak super succulent and the sides amongst the best I've ever had.
5
We dined here prior to attending a show (Blue Man Group) in the Marina Bay Sands Theater. The menu was fixed as we were on a limited schedule, however we were very satisfied. The crab entree was very good. The steaks were spectacular and cooked to perfection and the chicken was excellent as well as being a huge portion. We struggled to finish. The whole meal was complimented by excellent wines and very good service, particularly that of Angie who looked after us for the whole meal. An excellent dining experience and we will definitely be back
4
Not the best steakhouse in Singapore but well up there. The service was great as was the food. Maybe a little bit pricey for what it was?One annoying thing I see regularly in certain restaurants - A beer menu with 10+ options & I've never heard of one them? I don't go into a restaurant to drink beer per se, but I do like an odd one pre my meal but why restaurants such as this think they are better than serving recognised worldwide brands is beyond me? Instead I get offered a plethora of local/unknown beers that taste like dish water. Come on guys, if you think you are the connoisseurs of worldwide beers, at least give Neanderthals like me just one option I recognise just in case I don't fancy your local rubbish
5
Really such a lovely restaurant - we stopped by for cocktails on Christmas Eve and were blown away by how good they were! So we had to come back to eat! The service is top notch! Attention to detail and how everyone performs their roles should be a lesson for all restaurants in singapore to follow. The extras that come with the meal are plenty so don't eat too much if you want to finish your huge steak! Really an amazing meal.
4
Amazing cocktails. Friendly service , not necessarily very knowledgeable but very friendly. The food was very good. The only thing I did not like was the bone marrow as a side addition. It really did not taste good.. The appetizers were great : pea soup , scallops in particular. Great Wagyu especially the snow .. Huge wine list , in which we managed to find a very good 175 bucks bottle ( not easy ) . Will come back definitively but this is only in the knowledge that you will pay a huge amount of money for It
5
I've often found it hard to find a really good quality steak in Singapore. There is Mortons which is overpriced and far from amazing quality and maybe a few others places i can think of so finding CUT was great. I've been several times and it hasn't disappointed me yet. Service is exceptional with what seems like almost one waiter per table there were so many staff. Steak was cooked perfectly and a really good quality bit of meat. Cocktails are pricy but good and they have a large selection
5
The food was fantastic, if slightly limited in choice of sides. Each side is a gigantic plate of one thing, so unless you have a table of 4-6 there's going to be limited flavours.Cocktails are original, well prepared and fantastic. This place would get 5 stars just as a cocktail bar.Staff are very friendly and professional, the bar part of the restaurant is surprisingly lively and fun.Price is top end, you could eat at a Michelin star place with change for the cost of this, but if you're willing to pay its worth it.
4
The food was great and restaurant. For me the price is too expensive for what you get when compared to Australia but I do recognise that it can cost more in Singapore. We also tried Sky on 57 and we preferred the food at Cut which was nicer.The white wine was terrible so be careful with what you order and the cost of water is ridicules as well. Also the prices were more that what was listed with the online menu

Went here for a special birthday meal. The food was excellent, we both had fillet steaks, mine was on the bone which I've not heard of before. Both were perfectly cooked and had excellent flavour.A little strange for us that it is located in a shopping mall, but once inside you can forget about that. The service was very good if not just a little bit over attentive at times, but not enough to be annoying.We really enjoyed and can recommend

This is the best steakhouse in Singapore by far. Congratulations to the chef. Excellent service adds something extra.

Great food & wine! We enjoyed excellent service especially from Angeline & Ryan. The starter was exceptional, although the beef could be better.
5
Great service, atmosphere and amazing meat (and lobsters) and good wine selection in this W Puck restaurant in MBS. Pricey but worth a visit. PS. Some meat dishes serve two (ladies) easily.

Went for a birthday dinner while visiting Singapore. Fantastic food and service, great wine list. Worth the price and then some.

I've been lucky enough to have lived in NYC and whilst this is a good steak it's somewhat overrated as I had friends describe this place as amazing. The taste is good but the prices cannot be described as good value, apart from the bar. Also have to say that the service was excellent.Approx SGD 700 for 3 people for:- 2 pre dinner drinks- 2 starters- a main each (their cheapest sirloin and rib eyes)- 3 sides- a bottle of own brand Cabernet Sauvignon- and a dessert to shar

Came to Cut to have dinner and drinks. Jan Jurecka and Lugiswaran make the best drinks in town - consistent and delicious. And Chef Burton Yi really knows his food. He's gifted and never fails to up the game. This is perhaps one of the best restaurants in the world. Thank you,Paul Joseph, for running the tightest ship in town. Cut is, unequivocally, a global and Asian jewel.

Cut by Wolfgang Puck for a dinner with my wife - this was our FIRST experience at a CUT restaurant and we could not find one thing wrong - everything surpassed our beliefs. The decor is elegant and classyâ€¦ dark with lighting accents. And walls upon walls of fine wine and the excellent seating at the bar are comfortable .the attention received from the bartender, the cocktail waitress, and waiters including the management, the service were over-the-top. And the food was Amazing especially the steak was cooked perfect. The wine list is inspiring. The facility it offers the highest level of personalised service. While Cut by Wolfgang Puck is not the cheapest place to eat in Singapore, but it is well worth the exceptional service and quality of food ,it is worth every dollar that you spent in that restaurant, absolutely one of the best restaurants in Singapore

I have never tasted any steak that is cooked to perfection. Every inch of every bite brought our eyes close and thank the heavens for the opportunity to savor each bite,Now let us go back to the BEFORE -- I swore years prior that I would have the chance to eat there IF I go back to Singapore. My then boyfriend booked us a trip to SG for my birthday and that was it! The online booking was necessary. They even called me up the morning prior to my birthday dinner while I was still overseas to confirm! How impressively professional.Fast forward to our three-hours delayed flight and good thing the reservation still is available. We had it late at 9pm and it was still alright. We were expecting a snooty waiter to snubbishly breathe down the menu but lo and behold, the staff is very courteous and welcoming. I love them! No worries if it's your 1st time. they will walk you through the best sellers and recommend according to your taste and appetite. I splurged on appetizers, and even had one steak each. Lesson learned here is that the dishes CAN BE shared. And they won't judge you for it, Now what do I remember --- bone marrow - heavenly! scallops - cold but lovely! steak - to DIE FOR! Desserts --- for my birthday, they sent us samplers and they were just so.... right! And yes, it was a splurge, but all worth it, I may say
5
We ordered Miyazaki Kyushu Filet Mignon, its very tender, no fat but juicy, perfectly grilled and seasoned, its perfect. We use no sauce at all, and we find it the best way to eat it. Not even with the different kind of mustard they served. Presentation seems so blank as its small meat on the big plate, but the taste really complement it.The sauteed dover sole is so so, nothing special, well, their specialty is MEAT and steak, so stick with it. We ordered broccoli and its so tasty, crunchy, perfectly seasoned. And the best beside the filet mignon will be the chocolate souffle... its not easy to made one, but this one is soft but crunchy on the skin, its just PERFECT.. The price is pricey though, since we are taking the highest filet mignon, but its worth to try
5
The best steak I have eaten in my life!!!Had the American filet mignon cooked medium area and it was absolute perfection!! My knife just glided thru like butter.The sides were just as amazing.The restaurant has a romantic ambiance and the service was faultless.Highly recommend. Would definitely dine here agai
5
Been here twice, Baby chicken was really nice. The America wagyu ribeye were great as well. Dessert was really unique. Got served twice by the waitress name Marilou, service was amazing and very friendly.
5
No question this was the most tender and delicious steak I've had in Singapore, but be prepared to pay for the pleasure. Worth it if you're craving a delicious steak.
5
It's a nice place to have a quality steak. I have tried several steaks here and I love the US imported ones. The restaurant is quite pricy. If the price does not bother you, it's worth a visit.
5
Been there many times over and hands down the best place to have perfectly cooked steak in Singapore. The restaurant has good ambience with a nice bar area for waiting in case you do arrive early. Highly recommend you get an reservation here though as the place get's booked up specially on Friday nights and the weekends. Walking in is not advised. There's an insanely good selection of cuts with delicious sides to go with it. Btw, the mashed potato side is mind blowing and a must have to go with your steak. Simply divine
5
Best steak house in Singapore. The very best! The food is amazing. Ambiance is great. Service is excellent. You can't go wrong. It is pricy but honestly it is worth it! They have great and a wide selections of wines too! I suggest you make reservation since its almost always full.
4
Food is Very Good Complimentary cheese bread is very good. The mini burger starter is as good Tried both Angus Rib Eye and Wagyu Sirlion both perfectly cooked but I prefer the rib eye. The Sides are definitely for sharing. All the sides are worth the calories: creamed spinach, mashed potato, broccoli Price Wise, it is on the HIGH Side
5
Second time we have been there. 12 months apart. Both times excellent food, great wines and superb service.We have now ordered 14 different meals over the past year, consumed different wines and everything has been outstanding.The quality of the food, attention to detail, presentation of the food and interaction with the staff is something that Wolfgang Puck would be very proud of. I hope that he visits this excellent restaurant as a treat for himself
5
It's not only a steakhouse, it's full of romance. Thanks CUT for giving us one of the best memory in our lifetime. Thanks the most handsome Irlan and his team. It's the best place that you can't miss!!! Thanks all the efforts and arrangement which you have done to us. We really appreciate!!

We were early arriving at 600pm for the early dinner. The service was sharp and hospitable. We were promptly escorted to our table. The interior was modern with mirror glass walls & floor to ceiling wine display. There were some pictures of iconic personalities.The servers were very good, helpful, their customer services were superb all out to please the customers.However the dinning area was rather dark which is quite impossible to see the prints on the menu. Overall the tables were too near each other.We were served cheesy choux pastry and bread sticks. They were very good. The selection of table bread were amazing.The early evening dinner offered 2 course with a starter of blue crab shrimp and main was the Sirlion with mixed green and crisp potatoes. The beef was tender and succulent very flavorful. We throughly enjoyed our evening outing
4
I have been going to CUT for the last 5 years. The food is expensive, consistent and delicious. However in the last year I've noticed the service isn't as good as it used to be. The wait staff is not as attentive and I found the service a bit slow the last time I was there.
5
Best steaks in town!
The Kobe steak is just amazing! I had the filet mignon. The pork belly starter was also really good.
They also have an excellent cocktail menu.
5
The steak has always been excellent. The appetizers are so delicious and the side, pee wee potato, is what lures me back again. Great services from Sophian and Angeline throughout the whole dinner.
5
I entertained several clients and both the service and food did not disappoint. The steak was amazing and the wine list is strong. At the top end of the price spectrum but not unreasonable for what we experienced
5
We went to CUT on a day where they had a set-menu option, we were slightly restricted in terms of what we wanted to eat but in the end it was fantastic. Everyone really enjoyed their food and I can definitely recommend it.
5
We celebrated my father's 75th birthday here. It was a splurge that was well worth it. Food is truly excellent, we had a selection of starters, steak, chicken and several sides and it was all excellent. Best cheesecake in he world. Service is very good despite initial glitches as starters arrived before the wine. Good atmosphere despite it being in a mall (can't tell). The only letdown are other guests who wear tshirts and flipflops on a Saturday evening / dress code needs to be enforced!
4
Booked in for an engagement dinner celebration. Only time available was 9pm, late for us but we took it anyway. Had to wait about 30 mins for our table. But lovely service from the ladies out the front in the bar area.First glance at the menu was with wide eyes...not a place to come if you are on a budget! Wine not too badly priced compared to other places at Marina Bay - but hard to accept paying $209 when you can get the same bottle of wine for about $25 back in Oz! Do not be afraid to ask to share the steaks or baby chicken - serving sizes are massive! Great free bread service, four different choices, along with free cheese sticks and puffs. Service at the table faultless. They know how to make you feel pampered! Definitely recommend the baby chicken and mushrooms!
5
Good bar before getting seated. Lovely hostess crew. Nicely laid out and quite eye catching wall mounted wine cellars. Menu is simple and makes it easy to decide. Starters are small portions. Steaks range from different cuts and age. Side menu large and lots to choose and share from. The ambience us conducive to having conversations and you don't feel the background noise. Service was good. However the time between starters and our mains took rather long and so did the bill settlement. If you like your Steaks and are looking to pair this with quality wines and have the money to fork out them it's worth a visit.
5
The absolute highlight of the night was the complimentary table bread they service at this place. There are four options AND ALL FOUR ARE AMAZING. Make sure you try them all, they allow you to have a few servings and are really open for you to ask for more.In addition, surprisingly the meal my partner and I had at Cut (Two steaks and their roast chicken) was priced CHEAPER than a set menu for two at Gordon Ramsey's Bread Street Kitchen restaurant which is also located at the Marina Bay Sands complex. I went with the American Wagyu and it was absolutely the most well cooked steak i have ever had. Definitely a place one should visit if you have the spare coin
4
Both the food and service here are impeccable! The steals are superb, properly charred on the outside and full of dry aged flavors on the inside. My Blackmore ribeye was done to a precise medium rare and it was tremendous! Perhaps even better than those we get at rock pool.Service was haute. Our server never left us alone for too long and he kept checking on us with good recommendationsThe only reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is the price. While they serve tremendous food, it is tremendously costly here as well.
5
We dined at CUT on our 10th wedding anniversary and couldn't have asked for a better evening. I had requested a quiet table in my booking and we were kindly given a lovely booth. Once inside the restaurant, you don't realise you are actually in a mall. (Side note: most of the hotel restaurants are actually in the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes, so if you are staying at the hotel allow yourself time to get from your room, to the mall and to the restaurant. It's not just 'popping down to the hotel restaurant'!) From the moment we entered the restaurant, it was a fantastic experience. The staff were fantastic (in particular, Marvin, our waiter), attentive, but not intrusive. The bread sticks and bread selection are outstanding. I'm still dreaming about the pretzel rolls - I'd happily pay $50 another one! We had the Australian Porterhouse for two, which was carved and served table side. It was outstanding and cooked to perfection. The Mac & Cheese is also incredible! For dessert we ordered the Valrhona Chocolate SoufflÃ©, which the waitress brought out and added the accompaniments to at the table. We don't drink wine, so didn't take much notice of the wine list, other than it was extensive! While, yes, it is an expensive meal, for our special occasion we felt it was worth every cent. Wouldn't hesitate to eat there again if we are ever back in Singapore
5
Amazing food, service and ambience but you DO pay for it. Nevertheless, no complaints as everything was 5 star. Great for a special occasion dinner.
4
Come here prepared for some amazing food! Great steaks, good strong cocktails and a hole in your wallet.
If you really must try cut then come for the chocolate souffle. It's probably the best in the world.
5
Had a great birthday dinner there. We probably got the best seat in the house and perfect service. Food was great but clearly comes with with a price
5
My husband & I decided to treat ourselves during a 4 night break in Singapore...and a treat is exactly what it was on all accounts!! We ordered the filet Mignon & the rib eye which were both incredible. I wouldn't usually order steak when I dine out but I felt it would be inappropriate to come 'Cut' and not try it. My hubby loves steak when he's out & needless to say he raved about his rib eye...every mouthful was a taste sensation. We added chips, onion rings & a few sauces & that was more than enough for 2 people. The sides are quite generous portions.The staff were attentive but not over the top, the restaurant is beautiful and the bread they offer before your meal is yummy!The prices are very high & the wine list could be a little more extensive but overall it was a wonderful experience that I would recommend to anyone going to Singapore...just make sure you bring your credit card!!! :)
5
I chose Cut as the venue for a birthday dinner for my husband, and that decision couldn't have been better! Everything was truly outstanding (and I have very high expectations - ask said husband :-)) from the moment we walked in to the smooth, stylish, dark interior and were led to a lovely booth. From there, it was cocktails, excellent grissini and a choice of really lovely breads all baked on the premises. Of course, we couldn't resist the steak choices which we actually thought were really quite reasonably priced for Singapore. We started with a shared salad (heirloom apple with fennel and waldorf dressing) which they divided into two plates for us. Then we absolutely relished the steaks, and totally over-ordered (happily so) on the sides, with brussell sprouts and smashed potatoes and broccolini. I couldn't fault a thing. If only we could have managed dessert; the lovely staff brought out a small cake with candle in any case. Plus, they correctly judged that my husband would hate a chorus of "Happy Birthday" sung to him, so wisely just presented the cake and candle, and left us to it. The service was genuinely as good as it gets in Singapore. Sadly, service here even at the highest-end establishments can be really woeful. Not here. Staff are well-briefed, know what they are doing, read their tables well, and provided perfect, unobtrusive but personalised and very warm service. We couldn't have been happier with our evening, and would recommend others try it out too. On this Thursday evening, the restaurant had a great, high-energy buzz to it. We'll be back for sure! Thank you Cut for making his birthday memorable
5
Modern clean looking interior....and nice ambiance. The food quality is great and the portion is generous. Recommended for steak lovers. Price is not cheap but you got what you pay for. From starter, main course and dessert. ..all were delicious ! Not forgetting to mention that the bar did good cocktails
5
THERE IS NO FOOD HERE THAT IS just GOOD. I'd like to start with that because it is really the bestFrom serviceTo food qualityTo priceYES PRICEFOr 3 pax averaging sgd$200 each, without hesitation of ordering anything from wine to beer ...It is cheap with the quality food and service we gotMy mom who is a complain person ....the cut team found her sweet tooth (which is good ((free bread!!)) :) Im not a bread lover.....but the different kind of bread (thats complimentary) was very good, best I've had actually! Appetizer Alaskan crab and prawn louie --- very very good appetizer ! (Recommend by our waitress :)) Every bite makes u wanting for more, makes u eager to get ur main meal, which is what an appetizer should be !Steak is priced an average sgd$100, and I would say I've had More expensive steak but CUT serves very quality meat! WORTH EVERY BITEPLUS what Makes CUT special is the pride of the restaurant and staff, every bit is to impress !It's a restaurant where NOONE CAN GET WRONG with any order !Thanks you CUT TEAm!!!
5
We came here for a joint birthday dinner. Once again we were so happy to come back and the staff remembered us from several months ago.The food and service is still excellent. We had the birthday degustation and were terribly spoilt. The pea soup was good with nice bacon. The pork belly was a good balance of taste and texture. The most notable dishes were as usual the stunning lobster and their steak. I loved the spinach with egg the last two times but somehow it wasnt as amazing this time for some reason, good but not remarkable. Marvin was our waiter again and he is wonderful. So pleasant, excellent service and has a good memory from the last time - wished more restaurants had service like his!Thanks again for another memorable meal - coming back again to attack the lobster - please leave it on the menu permanently
5
Undoubtably one of the best steak I was able to enjoy in Singapore! Although the price is seemingly high, the price is comparable to other good quality steak restaurants. The service was wonderful, and the waiters and waitresses were able to promptly respond to our requests. Apart from their main steak courses, they also offer a wide array of side dishes, which is constantly revamped in accordance to a friend of mine who visited 2 months before I did. Additionally, their beverage menu was divine, especially their choice of cocktails which flaunts a unique choice of drinks.That being said, I do believe the waiters and waitresses can introduce the spices upon serving them with the dishes
5
Had a great time celebrating Valentine's at Cut.Our server, Marilou, served with a big smile and was very helpful in our orders. Upon finding out we wanted to have the wagyu, she helpfully suggested we could have have a "special wagyu ribeye" order that was available that day, that would be more economical for my husband and I to share. Indeed, the cut we had was of a high quality and was more value for money than what we would have originally ordered. She also made a good suggestion to divide our bone marrow flan to share between my husband and I.Of the items we had, the wagyu ribeye and bone marrow flan were outstanding. The beef is one of the best we have had and the bone marrow was very tasty. Overall, the experience at Cut was well above our expectations
5
If you are ever in Singapore and hungry for an incredible piece of meat, stop in at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino to visit this restaurant. It is expensive and worth every penny. This is a place that you "save" for if needed.
5
High quality steaks and a superb wine list. As with most high end restaurants in Singapore, it is a bit pricy but you get what you pay for. Located in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Center.
3
The food is okay, American style meat, potatoes cooked reasonably well. Service is well intentioned but inept.
5
Thank you so much Nok, Michael,Nickson and Sam excellent service and the sirloin is perfect definitely will be back again ..Vivian and Ming
5
Very pleasant dining experience. Great food and attentive and friendly service by Ms. Marilou, Angeline and Ryan. Recommended
2
Ok so I got over paying 80 dollars for a steak and the food quality was very good indeed. Problem is if you set 5 star prices I expect 5 star service. Don't serve a migraine sufferer bread and bread sticks without telling them they both contain Parmesan. Please turn the lights up so we can see, please turn down the music so we can hear the waiters. Don't ask if we have finished when my wife is still eating, do tell us what the 5 spices are that you just put on our table and finally, tell us that the fries and onion ring portions are enough for 4 adults. Saying that, the steak was very good the service was not. Overpriced
4
Was there for Friend's birthday. Ordered Prawn Cocktail with wasabi sauce, Rib Eye Steak, Onion Ring and Brocolli. Steak was greatly cooked. Dinner closed with Apple Crumble with roasted almond and vanilla ice cream. Overall, the service by Marilou, Angeline and Steven was excellent. Will come back for another birthday dinner
5
Excellent professional and friendly service (never in a restaurant with so many staff!)Food was of extremely high quality - steak superb, lobster superb.Location is in the middle of a mall but kitted out very well.Only gripe is that it is very expensive i.e. three smallish bottles of water came to SGD 42!However for the best steakhouse I have been in it was worth i
5
Lovely dinner today. Ordered the crab louis and japanese steak. All the good reviews that I have read about this restaurant are true. The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced, a very good experience! Thank you to Irlan and Steven who was very polite and responsive
5
I was there with my wife and another couple and all four of us enjoyed a lot. Food is very high quality and atmosphere is very good. We use to go to a lot of restaurants and this could rate very highly in our list. Highly recommended if you are looking for a high quality experience
5
It's located in the largest mall in Singapore; The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,
You need to book ur table ahead of time, we loved their food, staff and ambiance.
5
Entree Alaska crab and also fresh oysters. Main Japanese Wagyu 10+ marble count. Dessert Chocolate Souffle. OMG, the food was so good. The steak melts in your mouth. Service was great as well this is an expensive restaurant but trust me, it is worth every cent. Thank you for the great experience.
5
The service at Cut soars above other restaurants in Singapore. There are numerous waiters and a sommelier on staff that will take care of everything, quickly. They come around with a selection of bread prior to the meal and show the different cuts of meat prior to ordering. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious. We did not get appetizers and I would suggest just ordering sides instead of apps. Great ambience, with the only "odd" thing being in a mall.Overall, would definitely recommend
3
Went to Cut last weekend and was not very impressed with the price-quality ratio. The meat, bread and wine selection were quite good, the side dishes were so-so and the noise was to be honest WAY too loud. Between the loud music and the fact that the place was packed, it was seriously difficult to hear each other speak!Will probably not be going back...
3
Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking...But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost
5
A very stylish, upmarket restaurant. Steaks are their specialty and yes, they can be proud of what they serve. The steaks come from different parts of the world and the meat & marbling varies depending on what the animal is fed on. The steaks are juicy and cooked to perfection, the right size and a great choice of sauces.Ideal place to celebrate a special occasion.
5
I was very nervous about having dinner in this Singapore outpost of Wolfgang Puck's enormous empire after a dreadful experience in the London Cut.This,however,was superb.The fillet mignon was truly memorable,the peewee potatoes addictive and unbeatable ,all served with flair and charm.The extensive wine list is actually reasonably priced with some especially fine Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon.The place really buzzes in the evening and is the really outstanding place for steak in Singapore.Wolfgang knows what he is doing here.Rubin,the manager exudes a Cataln charm which is also fabulous
5
Amazing service, amazing cuts of beef plus nice extra touches that go a long way. Perfect meal. Very attentive waitress and nice selection of breads brought round more than once should you want them. Was too full for dessert but received a small tray of nice sweets free of charge anyway. Top job Wolfgang and co
5
I absolutely loved this restaurant when i stayed in Singapore. The restaurant is very dark and has portraits of different celebrities on the wall. The staff was dressed to impressed and very well groomed. As for the food...... AMAZING! I ordered the lobster which came out on a tray and one of the waiters cut the meat out of it for me. If you would like a tip..... I would highly recommend trying the 'Rough Love' cocktail.
5
We go to Cut on special occasions and it never disappoints. On our last visit, we were reminded of why we like it so much. Fabulous cocktails that actually have alcohol in them. If you've been to a lot of bars or restaurants in Singapore you know that the cocktails are normally watered down. Not at Cut. Then there are those little cheese things. Not the sticks, though those are good too. It's the ball of cheese puff that comes to the table. YUM. They'll keep bringing you more if you want. Save room for dinner though.I'm a vegetarian so I ordered 4 side dishes and a plate. The vegetables are cooked properly, seasoned perfectly and I'm happy as can be. My husband can have his steak and help himself to my vegetables.We either continue on the cocktails (sooooo good) or have a nice bottle of wine. We aren't big dessert people so we don't normally have dessert. At the end of the meal, we've received stunning service, stunning food and we leave very happy
5
Wow great restaurant , decor , service , wine selection and food. Met all our expectations.We had a fantastic meal on our last night in Singapore.
5
My wife and I had our anniversary dinner at Cut. As a fine dining experience this is the top of the class in Singapore. The attention to detail here is exemplary on every level and its the little touches that make the difference.The layout of the restaurant immediately separates you from the Marina Bay Shoppes so this feels like a special place the minute you walk in. The service overall was by the far the best I have seen in Singapore and the food and wine selected did not let that down in any way. Presentation, quality, taste all perfect.Fine dining does come at a cost but for a special occasion or not this is worth every cent. Highly recommended
5
The Managers was kind enough to make room for my family of 2 after other local hotel establishment screwed up my reservation. But in retrospect, very happy they did. The first-time visit so I aways order the least expensive Steak to get a feel for what's going on at the grill .. And let me tell you, it was great. . Cooked to absolute medium rare perfection along with exacting outside char. Other family members ordered the traditional steak house alternative, Dover Sole and equally raved about the taste and preparation. But I think a touch of class came from the Waitress who noticed the family struggling to finish our first bottle of white, and she offered to change our second ordered bottle ( RED) to service by the glass as I was the only one then looking for wine. Now not sure if it was already opened ,but regardless nice touc
5
Let me state clearly that this place is entirely out of our regular budget, it's a long story about how my sister and I ended up here. However that being said it was a happy accident. This was quite simply the best steak I had ever eaten( this is a bold statement as I am Australian). It was a beautifully selected piece of meat cooked medium rare to absolute perfection and melted in the mouth. We had the brussell sprouts and the cheese polenta as sides which were incredibly impressive. The staff were impeccable and the service was exactly at the level you would expect in this price range. There is nothing more irritating then spending money and then getting a poor experience. Puck delivers.So if you have cash to splash and a hankering for some flesh - it is a 'Cut' above the rest

We have heard rave reviews about CUT and thus visited for my Bday. We broke tradition for my last Bday as we usually go to our favorite steakhouse for special occasions. The prices on CUT's menu easily rate as one of the most expensive among steakhouses in sg, so we are definitely expecting top quality food, service and experience here.The service is mostly excellent and attentive with the occasional banter. We enjoyed the Service. However, some restaurants in the same category offer a little bit more for special occasions like photos, complimentary champagne (we gotten ours through our citibank privilege) or dessert. Hence, CUT falls a little short here.The Steak is surely good, but not excellent for the price asked. We could recommend other restaurants that could do better steak then CUT at slightly lower prices. Atmosphere is mostly enjoyable, even though it's crowded but a little noisy.Hence I would rate CUT 4 stars for service, 3.5 stars for atmosphere, 3 stars for food (relative to its price, and what other equivalent restaurants charge for equal quality food), and 3 stars for waiting time as it took longerv than expected.Overall it was a 3 stars experience
4
Very refreshing cocktail, 'Rough Love' cocktail made out of gin, choya - japanese plum wine, peach bitters and top up champagne. Ordered light bites, shishito tempura, mini burgers were tender served with soft buns. Followed by dinner at the dining area, we ordered a starter, 2 steaks (ribeye, aged ribeye) grilled to medium rare perfection, 3 sides (peevee potatoes, mushrooms & onion rings) to share with 4guest. Onions rings were home made, best onion rings that i have tasted. Other sides, i could say, the chef could go lighter on the salt. And ended with chocolate dessert.It was a good dinner with a price tag, but it's worth the experience and will definitely return when there is a special occasion
4
- Be treated to some of the best steaks in Singapore, made the way yoy like them.- Chef Wolfgang Puck is one of a small number of celebrity chefs who set up shop here.- Service is pleasant and overall dining experience is tops. Certainly worth the time spent at, and price of, a very good meal
5
This truly was a meal that I will remember forever. The service was outstanding. The steak was perfectly cooked. I was so pleased by this meal and this restaurant. It did come with a hefty price tag, but don't let that deter you. This is a place that is worth ever penny.
5
If you have the pleasure of dining at Wolfgang Pucks excellent Cut restaurant ask for a gentleman named "Irlan', he is smart charming and an excellent member of the team. Its my third time to Cut and Im already looking forward to my next visit. Thanks to all the excellent team there, food is excellent, service is top notch!!
5
Tried to avoid spending so much for a steak but must admit it was worth every penny of it !Have the best grass fed Aussie steak ever, cooked to perfection.Were told that 1 side is enough for 2 but still had 2 sides and this was plenty
4
Service was great from Rasul and his team. Steak was better during our first visit 6 months back, but still probably the best in Singapore.
5
Thank you Carmicheal for the amazing cocktails and beautiful Raquel for the best service in town. Baked Alaska was divine. We will be back.
4
Great restaurant and was well taken care of by Rasul, Raj and Doris helpings us make our experience even better with good service and great recommendations.
2
Been there for dinner on 3 people and ordered different steaks menu. Meat is great & tender but all dishes are served over-salt. Not worth the price.
2
We've been going to Cut for three years and finally we see a chink in the armor. Once steak & service could not be matched in Singapore not to mentioned many other great cities. But now weaknesses are showing up. We experienced slow service, very hard to get server, apparently under staffed, they appear less motivated. Menu items are disappearing, such as bone in rib eye steak. Overall value and experience below average. Meal was average. I suspect this is the beginning of the end for Cut. It's typical to see these high end establishments lose their momentum and finally collapse. I would not recommend Cut at this point. There are better places to eat steak in Singapore

We have heard fantastic reviews about this restaurant look forward to having great steak.The restaurant possibly had trouble coping with our big group. 8 of us chose set menu as it offers USDA steaks. The rest chose a la cart. We were first told that Rib eye steaks were not available but when we were at the restaurants we were told that rib eye steak what available after all. Unfortunately, the steaks were not of good cuts, they were not tender and were veined badly. My filet steak was great but rib eyes were certainly great disappointment, .much below our expectation. Other friends enjoy their lobster and fish. The staff must be more careful about the quality of food they serve

We had a great time at the bar.A spanish manager came out and welclme us with a smile :)Manager Raquel knew that is our friends birthday and organized a Baked Alaska cake for the birthday girl, the cake is so awesome!! Thank you very much Raquel!The bartenders are very friendly, service team also very professional.Must try the mocktail "in the name of Love" if you are a non alcohol drinker like me.Thank you cut!! Awesome place! Will sure come back and bring friends to visit again!

Well it's Wolfgang Puck's steakhouse, so expectations was there. We were celebrating our anniversary and we made a reservation. We knew it was pricey and I read mixed reviews about it. But we just had to try it. We arrived and was put into a private booth seat at the entrance of the restaurant ( hmmm not too ideal for a romantic dinner) we were served bread, the bread was oven fresh and the texture was fantastic. We ordered a bone marrow flan and a soup for starters. The soup was forgettable or maybe the flan was just too delicious and took the lime light. We order two different steaks, medium rare. The steaks were cooked well but just not as savoury as we would have liked. It was quite disappointing. We could have cooked better at home. So yeah... Not great. We wanted to finish of with dessert. The dessert menu was unimpressive and very limited and had strange local flavour inspired dessert ( I am a local btw). So in the end we skipped it. But they were very sweet and they gave us a sweet surprise : a complimentary chocolate dessert to celebrate our anniversary. The ambience was posh and chic( not intimidating fine dining posh) ,dim lighting but the music was a retro /country mix ( very strange ) , didn't match the venue at all. The wine list was extensive but the servers were not very familiar with the wines and gave very vague and patronising answers and recommendations. In the end the wine we chose didn't compliment the steak very well. Service was polite ( not welcoming, u know it wasn't very sincere or well trained with their menu and wine list). Nevertheless it was an experience. My hubby and I agreed, it was an overpriced American steakhouse that was trying too hard to be chic. Verdict: best dish was the appetiser. And we won't be coming back again. Memorable cause it was Wolfgang puck with a so-so overpriced steak.

The food is just wonderful. Every steak we ordered were perfectly cooked to our preference. We had two kids (10-12) and didn't feel out of place at all with the good service. A must is the top-grade wagyu, just the place to have quality meats cooked so well. If only it were not so expensive, we would have given this 5/5. Perhaps it is the high cost in Singapore. Compared to Wolfgang Puck Pizza in Osaka, albeit a casual restaurant, was a very affordable place compared to the average Italian restaurant in Singapore. By the way Wolfgang Puck Pizza in Osaka was excellent too
3
There were 8 of us and the bill ran into several thousand dollars.That being said, the steak was lovely but if i was going to have dinner with friends its just far too expensive with limited extras for what you pay for.This place is for people with very deep pockets
4
Great restaurant, lovely atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff. If you love steak this is the place to be. Shared steak with 2 & it was perfect, tender & melt in the mouth! Lovely table in a cosy corner. Would definitely go back.
5
If you can afford it, you must try the snow beef. I never tasted anything like it! great side dishes and starters as well. Overall it was a nice dinner
5
Its a good idea in life to splurge sometimes (when you feel you can afford it) on Steak at a decent place. Without a doubt, THIS is the place to be.
Order nothing else, just the steak and foie gras and go home dreamy.
4
This is one of the better steakhouses in Singapore if not the best. These are very familiar lines describing the restaurant and I am not deviating from this description. Reservations are recommended if you do not want to dine at the bar. The wine list offers very excellent choices that goes well with the meats. It would have been better if they were more generous with the sauces for the steaks

This is a nice restaurant, I went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy so we were only able to get a seat at about 10pm. The bread selection brought out at the beginning is very tasty. Starters are small but nicely presented, and there is a good variety.We had the following dishes:Crab & shrimp 'Louis' + maple glazed pork belly. The crab has a good delicate taste, and the pork belly was fine but nothing special, there are Three 1cm x 3cm pieces. for the main courses, the steak is excellent, Id say 8/10.USDA 21day aged New York strip Medium rare + Tasting of New York sirloin also Medium rareBoth dishes were properly cooked and well presented. The A5 Kobe beef from the tasting plate was extremely rich, almost like eating butter. The other 2 were more flavourful and had a preferable texture for me.The NY Strip was very nice, perfectly cooked.Creamed spinach side dishMac & cheese side dish. I found this too salty, but my friend thought it was the best he had eaten, personal preference.We ordered a bottle of red wine, but it was not available, so we had to settle for something else, the alternative was OK but it was disappointing that we couldn't have our first choice.Service is very good, on par with most michelin starred restaurants, and the staff know plenty of detail about the dishes and ingredients they serve.As a guide, we paid a tiny bit under $800 for 2 starters, 2 main courses and a bottle of wine (inc service charge and tax). I will most likely continue to go to Mortons steak house instead in future, but glad I tried CUT
5
Has to be one of the best restaurants I have been to. Visited for my 3 year anniversary with my girlfriend while we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and it was nothing short than spectacular. Definitely not a place to go if you're trying to eat on a budget. However I had the Kobe beef steak and it was well worth it. My girlfriend had the Maine lobster and personally I'm not a big fan of lobster but I gave it a try and literally had me mouth watering wishing I ordered both. Also their homemade Pretzel buns are to die for, the only complaint I have is there wasn't more of it. I made sure to savor every bite as you never wanted to the ride of deliciousness to end.I will definitely be returning to CUT in the near future as the service is beyond excellent and with the food being unbelievable there is no way I couldn't come back. The staff was also nice enough to surprise us with a little anniversary desert, which again was just simply delicious
5
A lovely place to be if you love your steak! The ambience was nice n cosy ( we got a very nice corner table with sofa seating ). Service staff was very knowledgeable about their menu n recommendations of food... Go for the Wagyu beef if you could afford, it simply melts in your mouth!! The steak was so wonderfully done n seasoned that you really don't need any sauces to go with it. It was a very costly dinner but worth a try at least once in your life
5
We went to Cut on Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday and it was without doubt the best steak we have ever eaten. Everything we ate was wonderful. The food had so much flavor, the service was great and the wine was fantastic. It is expensive but worth every cent
5
CUT is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Quality of food is top level, service is top level, setup is top level! Cut is a place that needs several visits a year... Can't wait to go back for the delicious homemade bread, beef and tuna starters, choice of meats for mains - especially the pork! - delicious side dishes (mustards, polenta,....) and one of the best cocktails created with passion!
5
Family visit to celebrate our daughter high school graduation. The service was exactly as you would hope friendly, professional and attentive but not fussing over you. As for the food, it was simply outstanding. My wife and I shared the signature Porterhouse for two while our daughter had the New York. The side dishes were plentiful and the extensive win list will ensure you have no issues in finding a very good wine to wash it all down with.As for the cost considering the quality of the food and quantity of the servings we considered it good value for money.Very much looking forward to our next visit
5
My husband loves steak so I decided to take him here for his birthday and we were both extremely glad we went. The ambience is slick and stylish and the food did not disappoint our high expectations. The starters and breads (especially the pretzel bun) really whetted our appetite for the main event - perfectly grilled medium-rare wagyu steak. There was almost too to choose from in the cocktail list and since I couldn't decide what I wanted they custom made a cocktail for me. I have to commend the lady in charge of our table, Marilou, who was warm and friendly as well as extremely knowledgable about the menu. She was a big reason we had a memorable time that night
5
Great food, great wine, great service and great atmosphere.Very lucky to have this on the work account but it won't stop me from returning for a personal meal. A must visit if you love your steak and such a pleasant experience with the first class service
4
One of my first experiences out in Singapore, an exceptional evening. The food was exceptional something for everyone but if you are going definitely do steak, and a big steak at that. The wine list and other options will ensure you will not go thirsty, the service is really good the dÃ©cor is an eye opener but good fun. Definitely book and take your time over your mea
5
4 pages of single malts await in anticipation of my lovely wife arriving for a date. Warm, noisy, busy, sophisticated yet understated. Staff on their game, absolutely. Bar is itself a destination.The menu is what Rockpool Bar & Grill (Sydney) wants to be when it grows up. Cuts fitting for a king, with an array of sides befitting their own serious attention. Glorious. Only outdone by the wine list, which itself weighed in at 2.2kgs. Wow.Mortgage the house. Sell a kidney. Do whatever it takes
4
Ordered the Japanese Wagyu steak that cost about 300$. Requested for medium rare but too rare for me . The steak itself is Good quality . Must order the cream spinach , one of the best in sg ! Overall Good experience but would only go once .
4
Had a teambuilding dinner at this place. We were kindly received by the hosted and escorted to the lounge room for drinks. The meat was in one word delicious! Perfect cuts, well seasoned and very juicy! Literally melted on your thong. Side dished and add on's where very tasteful but at an incredible price (SGD 15 for a couple of mushrooms) so was the final bill If you have the means - it's worth checking this place out as it is a feast to the taste butt
5
Everything about last night was perfect. The precision of the cuts, the tenderness of the meat and the seasoning that had paprika and probably some cinnamon in it. We are on our honeymoon and they even gave us the dessert on the house. Great ambiance. Very kind and attentive service. Prices are high.
4
Was in Singapore for work and indulged one evening for dinner. By far the most I've ever spent on a solo meal and at least half my wine was comp'd by the bartender as he and I spent several hours talking wine and Napa, California (he had a great interest in it). Food was delicious but the portions were extremely small. I wound up ordering room service later in the evening because I was hungry again. If you have the means - it's worth checking this place out
4
Food:The steak was perfectly cooked though the seasoning and sauce were a little disappointing. The sides were just 'fine' for the most part and though they were good (except for the onion rings which were too oily), we were expecting something a little more exceptional from this fine dining establishment. The complimentary bread sticks and bread were outstanding - absolutely delicious! And the smiling waiter serving them was a real charm!Service:Was good though it felt a bit 'forced' to some of us. Thumbs up for the classic (and well tailored) suit and tie uniforms.Decor:The decor/ambiance was the best. Lovely dimmed lights and decorative candles that set the right mood for dining. Overall, it was a good experience, but is it worth the hefty bill? We didn't think so.
4
I had heard many glowing recommendations and finally visited. Not what I expected, establishment wise, and I say that in a positive way. For a restaurant famous for its steak it didn't hit the mark! For medium rare to not have been rested was not good. The starter was excellent and the dessert was soufle to die for.I would try again as I guess it could have been an off night. The service was excellent and wine devine.
5
What an amazing restaurant. Design, ambience, service - everything is top. You think it can't get better? Hell yes!!! The food is simply exquisite. The meat was excellent!!! Definitely a place to visit when in Singapore!!!
5
My wife and I had a wonderful night at Cut on Saturday.Every aspect of our meal was near flawless from the pear and prosciutto salad we had for entree, the wagyu steaks we had for mains, the mac n cheese, onion rings and broccolini we had for sides and the apple crumble and snores bar we had for dessert. The wine was superb from an excellent and extensive wine list.Lastly, but not least, the service was fantastic from our waitstaff, including their recommendations which were all spot on. Thanks to Marilou, Nickson and Teong for their great service throughout the night.
3
Its telling that you leave having enjoyed dessert more than the steak.Ordered the american wagyu/angus ribeye, medium, chicago style. Meat came out slightly burnt past charred, too red/bloody inside. Kitchen needs to up its game. Sides were very good, prob best onion rings in town.Dessert was A grade, proper MBS standard. The hostess was unhelpful, exceeding rude bordering on insulting. Fortunately the servers were pleasant though a little forgetful. Hospitality has to be improved, management to note.We had better experiences at the bar on many other occasions. Would recommend for drinks
5
Well done!Every thing at Cut was a pleasant experience. The bread, the steaks, the sides and sauce, mustard samplings and I could continue. We ordered wine by the glass and got a nice full glass of wine.We have eaten at steakhouses around the world. Cut enters our top five. Really professional and fair prices
5
Big thank you to Ruben and the team who made our visit spectacular, from the outstanding food, quality and selection to the personal, attentive and professional service.Even with a late booking we were assured to take as long we wanted, soak up the occasion and enjoy ourselves which we did.The prices are reflective of what your getting - this is an experience to enjoy not just to have a meal. Shown around the wine collection, discussed the wine options, the food options which really made the night.Still having flashbacks to how good the Wagu steak was , the wine was and the laughs during and at the bar after! Top Work!!Special thanks to Ruben for pulling out his last bottle of Porrera, the Palo Cortado (i've already bought a bottle at home for this weekend) and the sublime 1965 Kopke Colretta port which is the most expensive drink I've thoroughly enjoyed and worth every penny.Will be back as soon as I can
3
For 150S$ per steak, the quality is only a little better than average. The table that was booked in advance wasn't have any view or good vibe. The space between tables was too squeeze to be able to have a private conversation. The services was very attentive though.
5
After traveling around Asia for an extended period of time, I was excited to see an American steakhouse. It's near impossible to get a good steak where I live in Europe, and even more impossible in Asia! This restaurant accommodated us on a busy night without reservations, gave us excellent service, an incredible meal and the most memorable evening in Singapore. I want to thank the staff for making our evening truly enjoyable. The steak was perfectly cooked, cocktails were tasty and the ambiance was perfect. I should also mention the reasonable prices for such a delightful restaurant. Love this place
4
This place serves up excellent choices of steak among other things. The drinks we got were good. I've noticed some people have mentioned how dark the lighting is, I have to agree with them, but each to their own, probably good for a anyone that's have a bad hair or makeup day.Jokes aside, the pricing for this place is on the extreme side. I've had this kind of quality steak all over the world and since the beef obviously doesn't come from Singapore it's not unique to Singapore. The pricing relative to what we got took it down a star for me. Other than that, hard to fault anything except for the lighting, but that's just preference I guess. I would recommend this place if Singapore is your only choice for steak or if you don't mind the price for some good steak.

i decided to have my birthday dinner here, but because of the mixed reviews i wasn't sure i'd want to pay 300 dollars for an all-out fancy dinner so i decided to sample the early evening dining menu. at 65 bucks for a two-course meal, i thought it shouldn't be so bad if it didn't turn out so great.i have a table for one, and so perhaps it could be why i got more attention, but the staff were really pleasant. somebody checked in on the food regularly, and topped up water as needed and asked if i want more bread. i went for the crab-and-shrimp louis starter and the steak, of course. i also had the wine pairing - a glass of rosÃ© to go with the salad and californian merlot for the steak. the sommelier was quite generous with the wine, the balloon glass for my red was half full.the crab and shrimp louis was presented beautifully and it was so good, i got sad when i finished it. but then again my steak arrived shortly after. i cut it in half to check if it's a perfect medium rare, and it was. the meat was well seasoned, very delightful and was perfect with the merlot i ordered. the caesar salad on the side was unnecessary i think. didn't help that it's placed in between the perfect steak and the perfectly crunchy, thin slices of onion rings stacked so neatly - which sadly went crashing down like uno stacko when i took one of them. that was on me. not to be racist, but there were a few filipino staff and they were the nicest to me, although the others were nice as well. they arranged for complimentary birthday sweets - banana and chocolate ice cream with fresh fruits and almonds, topped with cinnamon-ish thin cookie. i washed that down with white tea - like roasted rice tea - but the teapot makes 3 servings and more ideal for sharing. TLDR - fantastic early evening dining on my birthday. will come back again. as for trying the regular ala carte menu? possible
4
Superb steaks, and actually everything else - starters and desserts - excellent too. So would be five out of five on food, but slightly fell short on service - a couple of time it was difficult attracting attention from waiters, plus some misunderstanding of orders. Call me picky, but at over SGD 600 / head (three hundred quid) it needs to be absolutely spot on. Anyway, definitely worth a visit if you are on somebody else's money
5
Been here a few times - bread is good , ffilet mignon superb. Must try the soufflé with chocolate . Will be back
5
This is world class and deserving of it's reputation. The waiters were attentive to our needs and the food was a taste sensation. The extensive wine list offered wines from the best wine regions of the world. Our next booking is at CUT in London!
5
I was in search of a place to get a nice aperitif to reward myself after a tough work week. I really think I found the best in town. Charming and elegant environment and a delightful staff made me feel comfortable and at ease from the very moment I entered the premises. The quality of the drinks, starting from the choice of the spirits to the technique of preparation is indeed top notch and the two barmen make for a really nice team besides the counter. A particular appreciation note to one of the two guys, Lujis. By his own admission this his his first job as barman, but his mastering of instruments, ingredients and process is more the one of a really seasoned pro. Look for him to prepare your cocktails and you won't be disappointed. Thumbs up
5
One of my favorite spots to eat in Singapore! The food is expensive, but you will leave feeling very satisfied. As a vegetarian I never thought I would enjoy eating at a steakhouse as much as I enjoy eating at Cut. There are plenty of creative vegetarian salads as well as a wide variety of sides that can serve as entrees. Portion sizes for both are generous. Dessert is a must. My favorite is their 50 bean vanilla ice cream, simple but so delicious!The service is outstanding. Both times we were served by Marilou and she was helpful and very attentive. She walked us through the menu and provided thoughtful suggestions. The hostesses are very accommodating as well.The decor is classy and modern with various celebrities faces plastered on the walls and menus. If you have a smaller party size, request a booth. They provide a more intimate dining experience.Overall a top fine dining experience in Singapore worthy of repeat visits, as many as your wallet and waistline will allow
5
We booked this restaurant for a fine dining experience for a special occasion while on holiday in Singapore. Yes, it is a "celebrity restaurant" and the prices are extremely expensive (the cheapest cut of meat is $75), however the quality and service did match. We were seated in one of the private booths, which gave a very intimate and personal touch to the evening. We had the pork belly entree, a new york sirloin and the ribeye. At first glance the meat on the plate on its own looked quite bare, but once you started eating it I found you did not need much accompaniment, as 340g of meat is actually quite a lot! The meat was beautifully seasoned and tasted exceptional, it was also cooked to perfection. We did manage to fit in dessert as well and the apple crumble and baked alaska were beautifully presented and melt in the mouth delicious. Overall this was fine dining at its best, although given the price it will probably not be repeated, but it will be remembered for a long time
4
It was a great dining experience, considering I was dining alone that night. The staff were all very attentive and nice, I was my luck that there is a sit considering the place is always fully booked. I chose the Wagyu and it was cooked perfectly. The marbling of the meat was great. They have extensive selection of cocktails. I have to commend them on their excellent mixing skills. The ratio, taste and presentation are all top of the class. It really compliment the food. Every sip feels refreshing with great depth in flavor.The price I would say worthy of the gourmet experience. Something to enjoy even without a company
5
This restaurant is expensive make no mistake, but they do everything well and they do it correctly.The service was attentive and what you would expect from a fine dining experience.The cocktails before were superb and were moved from the bar area to our table for six shortly after.The selections we had were extensive, and all seemed to enjoy their starters, I had the maple glazed pork belly, it was beautifully cooked and the taste was wonderful.Out of 6 people 5 opted for steaks and all enjoyed the experience. One small gripe the Armagnac and peppercorn sauce was awful. The other party had the Dover sole which was lovely.We ordered a glass of white with the sole and a bottle of red from Oregon - first time I have seen Oregon wine in 7 years in Singapore. It was a wonderful wine.The sides we ordered were huge portions enough for 6 to share.Nobody had room for desserts, so I can’t comment - our birthday girl got a small dessert complete with candle and she said that was great.Refreshingly I gave a Citibank card and didn't have to ask about the 10% discount they just did it.Not cheap by any stretch but you get what you pay for
5
My friend who lives in Bangkok took me here. It was a last minute kind of thing so we only had cocktails & soufflé.They were awesome...One day I decided to try their dinner. We had salad & bone marrow as appetizer. The salad was refreshing & appetizing while the bone marrow was fragrant, creamy & of course yummy. We had lobster and of course the chocolate soufflé as dessert. . Since then I keep going back.
5
This is a premium drinking and dining experience. Four gin and tonics and some bar snacks will set you back in the region of $200 SGD. But, the drinks are expertly mixed, with extreme attention to detail. All of the staff are charming, friendly and customer-focused. The food is deceptively simple, but perfectly fresh and beautifully presented, for example tuna & avocado tartare and wagyu beef sliders (see photos)
4
Food was excellent but you do pay for it. My wife had Dover sole and it is filleted in front of you. She found it too much too eat! I had the filet mignon and was cooked to perfection. A real treat but prepare your wallet and diet for a hammering
5
Exquisite service. Delicious food. Period. Paul Joseph and his crew should be commended for always striving for perfection.
5
Loved the layout of the place. Very classy ambience.
The food was great too. A good choice if you are in the mood for steak.
3
Great decor like other "celebrity-chef-restaurant" in MBS, Food are good (thourgh herb-marinated steak was not my taste), service also is great, but most of all, the wine list is amazing. I wish I could win tons of money at casino to enjoy them without worrying about the price

My partner and I went for a dinner 4 days ago and my overall experience was not good, considering that we paid almost S$400. If I pay this price I’m expecting perfection in front of my eyes and pleasure at the moment to eat. We both asked for the U.S.D.A. Prime, Illinois Corn Fed, Aged 21 Days Rib Eye Steak 395g for S$105 each. My partner’s meat was well done but was burnt. My meat was medium well and was cooked ok. However, the steak was around 50% fat and 50% meat. I tried to separate the fat from the meat and was quite unsuccessful so I left more than half on my plate. I felt let down so I called the waiter and expressed my disapproval. Although I’ve tried to finish my dish, I wasn’t happy and the waiter came back telling me that the Chef said this type of meat is fatty in general. Frankly, the response annoyed me, because I’m expecting this range of restaurants chose the best of the best in ingredients. The waiter did his best and gave us a dessert to make up for it and to be honest was the best of the night the presentation of the dessert was sexy, delicious and hit the mark definitely. As I said we weren’t impressed with the restaurant, we both think that one of the reasons the lights are dimmed is because they don’t want people to see the food. We won’t visit this restaurant again
5
the place a little bit crowded and noisy. I sat at the bar where they serve the full menu. I ordered the ribeye (australian meat) and it was cooked to perfection as I like it. Service was attentive, charm and at rhe right pace. It is Marina Bay Sands so expect prices accordingly. Everything expensive. But considering singapore prices good value for Money. Wine list extensive with several options by the glass, not overpriced
5
This place has become 'THE' for both my mum and fiancee eversince we went there for our first meal. Yes, its definitely going blow your wallet buy hey, its by Wolfgang Puck for pete's sake. I wont say more - go give it a shot - NO REGRETS!
3
Celebrity restaurants at least in Singapore are for people who show up for special occasions such as son's graduation or anniversary and not worry too much about the value of the meal per se. We went there for our Son's graduation from grad school. Food was okay, not spectacular. Of the steaks the three of us ordered, Idaho Snake river Farm Ribeye was by far the best. It was juicy but not too fatty like the waygu and was well seared to near perfection without drying out the medium rare meat inside. Atmosphere was ok, lighting a bit dark, as reviewed by others in this site. Service was fine and responsive given the labor shortage. But for the money, this experience didn't sing the way one would have hoped: frankly, Ruth Chris' would have been about the same with much less damage to your wallet. Morton's would have a better wine list with slightly better steaks. Would probably not come back here unless the value equation is improved
5
I went there with 8 friends and the dinner was perfect from the beginning.The waiters were perfect and friendly, not tooo serious and not too intrusive.The meat choice is very vast, and the quality is absolutely TOP in class. I would compare it to the japanese Kobe beef.Plus: large wine list, nice ambientMinus: inside a commercial centr
5
The service was good from the minute we stepped into the restaurant till we left it, especially the male waiter ( I didn't get his name) who is really good at his service and Marilou, who was very friendly n gave us good recommendations. We have enjoyed the food served. Will definitely visit Cut again.
5
We had a fabulous time at Cut this evening. It was our first visit. We were delighted by the food—we had the asparagus and Burrata to start; the 340g grain fed ribeye as the main; and chocolate soufflé and pear & blackberry crumble to end the meal—and even more so by the service. Our service staff for the evening, Marilou, was friendly and very attentive. She gave recommendations on both dishes and portions, which we greatly appreciated. She also engaged us in conversation, which made us feel very welcome. Overall a fantastic first experience and needless to say, we will be back for more!
5
Absolutely great food and service, but at a price. A great place for the solo business traveller as you will be treated very well. Get a table in the bar area, the people watching during dinner adds variety
5
Tried here for dinner last night. The meat and fish are delicious. Service also very friendly. Vast selection of wines. A must try restaurant.
5
This is by far the best steakhouse in Singapore. It is also the most expensive. Expect to spend at least 100 sgd/ person excluding wine. Have had their 990g porterhouse and it is absolutely fantastic.
4
Ambience - gorgeous. Loved the celeb portraits on the walls.
Service - fantastic.
Food - delicious. Good portion sizes, amazing flavours. Loved it.
Only grouse - would be great if there were a couple of vegetarian options as well.
5
I've been there before and I'll keep going back ... it's as simple as that. Why?It doesn't get any better than this. The steaks are absolutely outstanding. Between the six of us, we had a selection of different starters so we could taste more than one. Each one was very, very good.There is one downside to eating a wagyu steak here ... the bar is set so high that Cut is in it's own league! No one even comes close !!!Excellent ambience, service and definitely worth a visit. Pricey, but outstanding
4
i went to the Cut at Marina Bay with some friends. the food is great but pricy. service is great as well, as you would expect from such a place.i also liked the bar which has a great selection and good barkeepers.compared to a steakhouse in NYC the quality is good but the price is much higher. but, you should never compare restaurants by cities
5
I was there with my girlfriend last Saturday celebrating our anniversary and we felt like VIPs the moment we got there.Even before ordering, we knew we were in for a real treat when we first munched on their bread sticks with parmesan shavings, followed by warm cheese puffs and burger sliders. If those were just to whet our appetite, we couldnt wait to see what was coming next. And we weren't disappointed.Their bread basket was alluring with a choice between their signature german bread, onion focaccia, sourdough and olive bread. the german bread had a slight sweetness to it and a hit of sea salt on the crust - masterfully crafted. For starters, we had the marinated pork belly and hokkaido scallops carpaccio. I dont remember the last time I had pork belly this tender and flavorful, nor scallops this sweet and refreshing.But of course, their steaks are the pièce de résistance. My partner had the USDA tenderloin and I had the American wagyu rib eye. Though it was definitely pricey, all of the numbers were forgotten when the steak was put into my mouth. The steak was cook to a perfect pink doneness, beautiful char and a buttery texture. Flavorful, tender and unforgettable. Definitely the best steak I have had in my life thus far. When I thought the meal couldnt be more complete, we had their signature chocolate souffle for deserts and it was amazing. Crispy exterior, moist interior with spiced chocolate ice cream and whipped cream. What better way to end the meal?A special shout out to our maître d Sam, who was very attentive to our needs throughout our dinner, without being intrusive. He knew his stuff and made our time more enjoyable
5
Really nice place. Good food and good service (which is really hard to find in Singapore). The slider appetizers are the best and worth trying. Steaks are cooked the way you like and sides are tasty and plentiful. One of the better steak places in Singapore
4
High quality ingredients make this restaurant stand out - service was so-so yet on-par with Singapore standards but the food was superb - as is the wine list, with a very interesting selection.MBS is always a good destination, with usually ample parking options and various choices for post-dinner drinks as well as those views

We were unable to secure a table in the restaurant but ate at the bar in front. The food and service were exceptional. Will most certainly be returning!

Well done Cut Team

This is our 3rd visit to the Cut. Still experienced the same great service and food. The staffs really helpful and they don't mind we shared the food with the kids. The food was excellent as usual and the desserts were amazing...😚

Dinner with my Family from Bali on 25 july 15, very unique place, nice food, excellence service, worth of 5 star restaurant. Sure come back next time. If you like steak, CUT is the place to go.

What a great place to visit? The drink and cocktails menu was amazing. The service was excellent. The bierce was beautiful. The welcome was great. I love the way the drinks were presented . I'm definitely coming back again and again and again. Kudos to all the staff for their knowledge amd service.

Cut by Wolfgang Puck is definitely one of the best meals I have ever had so far. The restaurant decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is fantastic. Service is extraordinary from the minute we stepped into the restaurant. We had the Hokkaido Scallops for our appetiser and the dish did not disappoint. The scallops were beautifully seasoned and melts in the mouth like butter. It leaved a sweet aftertaste as well, a very nice way to start off the dinner. I had the USDA Prime New York Sirloin as my main dish and it was perfectly cooked to a medium-rare as requested. Meat was of high quality and very delicious. Also tried the "tempting fate" mock-tail which happened to be the best drink I've ever had before. Dessert was a "Kaya Baked Alaska" and it's absolutely stunning, it's as good as, or if not better, than the steak! All in all, a very satisfying meal and we will definitely be back

Cut gives what a high-end steak house is expected to give -- no nonsense great steaks. We had a lovely meal. One of our guests who does not eat red meat had a lovely baby chicken -- deliciousThe standouts for us, however, were the cocktails -- expertly mixed with a wonderful commentary. Enjoyable.

It must be the hottest steakhouse in Singapore judging by how difficult it was to reserve a table. When we arrived, the lounge was overflow with guests. The start of our night was a little chaotic. At dinner, we ordered one of each of the 1kg Australian porterhouse and the 1kg Australian wagyu boned in rib eye for the 4 of us. The premium quality meat was masterfully grilled to heavenly perfection. Cut is truly the steak specialist. Overall, the service and the ambient did not make the cut for a premium restaurant. Fortunately the steak did and as expected so did the price

Dinner in a windowless mall restaurant? Well, yes, and it kind of works. But nearly didn’t. From the moment we arrived the attitude of the staff was “off”. Aloof & cold are two words that spring to mind. A rubbish table (we booked 10 days ahead!) was offered & then swiftly rejected for a nice booth. Thankfully after the shaky start the food was really rather great. Excellent Breads to nibble on before the steaks arrived. Very nice quality filets cooked nicely. Not the best but very good. The sides were perfect though and overall jacked our rating up to a 9.5/10. Not too shabby. Now, just sort out the attitude guys
5
I was excited to eat here, menu had something for everyone, but the steak was our first priority and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend this restaurant!
5
A farewell dinner ended up in laughter and a big tummy! Good variety in both food & beverage, great ambience. Reservation in advance is strongly recommended. You must try at least once!
5
This fine dining restaurant is pricey but worth every bite. Have been several times with business dinners and family dinners. Very tight space but great steaks!!!!
4
Have been several times now. The service is almost always impeccable. I've tried a range of their steaks from the AUS bone in ribeye, the tenderloin and wagyu bone in ribeye. They all have an excellent crust and come cooked exactly to your specification - in my case medium rare. My favourite is the AUS bone in ribeye. A great balance of flavour, tenderness and not overly fatty. The wagyu bone in ribeye is only for those who enjoy their steaks fatty. After a couple of bites of this massive steak I had already had enough. That's not like me with meat but it is a big steak and to be fair some people love the fatty wagyu. Just not my cup of tea. Don't bother with the sauces, they are not needed as the steaks taste great just the way they are. Besides, the sauces are a rip-off. The first two times we went they were complimentary but we know others who have been charged. Same for water. Which reminds me, the servers go around topping up the water continuously. The first two times we went this wasnt a problem as it was free but we got a massive shock on our third visit as they charged us a crazy amount for the water they poured. If you do want to try the starters our recommendation would be the scallops dish. It is divine. So to sum up, the food is very good, the service 5*. If you don't mind splashing the cash it is a good experience.
3
so it really depends on how much beef one can eat. The portions are so big - the first bite is really good but by the time one gets halfway through, one is feeling sick. And I am already ordering the smallest portion possible. And the price is not cheap - I really don't understand the premium which we are paying for. the place is so busy its so hard to ge a seat. When we arrived, even with our reservation on a weekday night, we had to hang around and wait for more than 30-45 minutes because the previous table had not yet left. It was crowded at the bar area and service was not good. they certainly did not feel bad that they kept us waiting. The area inside is dark and noisy - so not good for business either. All in all, wouldn't come here except for requests from customers.

I have read so many reviews on tripadvisor on this restaurant. Mostly very good reviews. Therefore, I have decided to try it out. For many years, I have been on the quest to look for that one steak that will beat the best one that I found in Malaysia. Anywhere from US to London to Thailand to DownUnder, I have been searching. The moment of truth have arrived!!Made a reservation for 3 pax on 15th July. Ordered 2 filet mignon Wagyu/Angus and 1 100% Rib Eye Japanese Wagyu. 1 portion Wild Field Mushrooms, 1 Tempura Onion Rings, and 1 Fried Peewee Potatoes mixed with other vegetables. Of course, how can you forget the Merlot recommended by the GM!!The wait staff are multinational. We have the very friendly General Manager, Wes Guild, from USA, Angie from Indonesia, Harry from Malaysia, and of course, the beautiful and always smiling Tracy from Vietnam. One of the BEST I have seen from around the world. Fantastic service!! Great Ambience!! Food wise??? In came the food,......FINALLY, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!!!!I have found a steak that can compete my own personal BEST!!! Truly what everyone has been posting in TripAdvisor has a lot of truth in their statement. Truly a steak to come back for more. Very juicy and tasty without any sauce. Imagine, 2 ladies and 1 guy have just finished every single bit from the plates. That's how good and tasty were the fine dishes that was served to us. The finale was the superb desserts. Apparently the chef do take pride in their creations. Compliments to the Chefs, Job well done.One last word, do dress proper for this restaurant, and do make your reservations well in advance in order to avoid any disappointment. I was there from 7:30pm. The place was bussing so busily until about 10:20pm++. Price wise is not an issue as long as the food is GOOD!!!DEFINTELY WILL COME BACK FOR MORE

I was at the Cut on June 28 for dinner with three friends. We got a seating at 8pm on a Sunday evening.The reception staff quickly showed us to our table and in quick order our waiter came over to ask our preference for still or sparkling water. We were then presented the menus and our mouths started to water at the entrees.My 3 friends had the American wagyu Rib Eye, wagyu Hokkaido Snow Beef and wagyu from Saga prefecture. I went with the American wagyu New York Sirloin. These were among the smallest cuts we could get, ranging from 170g to 280g. The other cuts were around 350g or more.The Japanese wagyu cuts were excellent. The wagyu from Saga was the most marbled. The snow beef was more lean. The rib eye was succulent, as was the sirloin. Hands down, Saga walked away the star...if you like your beef fatty, that is.This was premium beef as it should be. And it was grilled perfectly to a most proper medium rare. It was amazing.To go with the steaks, we ordered a nice Napa Valley Cabernet that was very complementary with the meal.I also ordered a starter butter lettuce salad which was enormous and served creatively. For sidings, Åµe had mashed potatoes, broccolini and mushrooms.The place was bit too dark for me but I guess it works well for a romantic dinner which wasn't the case for us. The service staff are attentive and helpful, even with recommendations.Pricey, yes. But you get what you pay for. Surely this dining experience made the Cut, and then some
5
For the Absolute Carnivorous Experience this superb restaurant by Celebrity Chef Wolfgang Puck is a must.The Deco is stunning and the service was impeccable from the moment you walk through the door.The selection of steaks is world class and the quality unparalleled by any standard.Pricey but a worthwhile experience. You only live once.
5
We were walking through the shops and happened upon this restaurant and got lucky to get a table in the bar. While the rest of the restaurant seemed fancy, eating in the bar with 2 (tired, crazy) small kids was perfect. The service was great and food was awesome. We enjoyed people watching from our table as well
5
I always like to come and sit by the bar, their bartenders just masters of the World! very friendly! And they can make even smth out of the list. Like once I was like spicy coktail and no any sweet liquor! And here it goes. Even they very super busy. They also serve full menu by the bar, which is nice, when you are not in the mood for all the way white cloths dining, but still want to enjoy good food and drink
5
Everything is to die for in CUT! The food is excellent and the cocktails are super good! I'm not really a red meat eater or a fanatic about cocktails, but this place has my mind changed! Especially the cocktails! Highly recommended!
4
Great cut and sides, enjoyed the exp. good atmosphere and waiter knew what the menu was all about in terms of cuts and recommendations. Loved the bread and Brussels sprouts, would be going again! Make sure to make a reservation
4
I don't know what it is with Asians and expensive restaurants in shopping malls?
Anyway this one works better than average but the pricing leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
5
I love everything about this restaurant. The ambience, decor, service, cocktails and best of all the food! The steak is super yummy and cooked to perfection, no additional sauce is required to accompany it. Definitely a must try in Singapore even if you are not a big fan of steak, CUT will change your mind
5
We came here for my wife's birthday - two adults and three children. The service at cut is very attentive, but not so overbearing that you couldn't enjoy your meal.The selection of beef is second to none and the waiter brings out the cuts of meat and explains each to you. We had the Kobe beef which when you first see the price makes your heart skip a beat, but when the first bite literally melts in your mouth is worth every cent.The selection of wine is amazing and very impressive to say the least. I had organized a birthday cake for my wife in advance which was delicious - The only disappointing part was being too full to try the other desserts.A definite must if you want to celebrate an event, or even if you want to try the most amazing mouth watering beef!
5
I must say that my best ever kobe I had in the cut. The price is crazy but just an exemptions steak. Restaurant settind is classy and nice, waitress well trained. All what u would expect from a premium steak place. Be careful it's not cheap
4
Don't suppose it matters where it is if it’s good... The tallest women in Singapore dressed like Robert Palmers backing dancer on Addicted to Love deliver you to your table. I had a bone marrow starter which i know is not to everyone’s tastes but i loved it. My USDA Prime corn fed rib eye steak (S$95 one of the cheapest available) was well cooked and thankfully delicious, the sides at (S$18) each, fries / Onion rings / veg seemed pricey we also ordered a potato tart-tatin which was new to me and delicious, topped off with an excellent béarnaise it was a good experience too full for dessert. Their wine was good and choice galore, but keep an eye on the price and enjoy the surroundings
4
cool ambiance, lively and youthful. the steaks were good, but i loved the mussels too. also the breadsticks served before we got our food. the complimentary breads were yum too. yeah its not cheap. so expect big dent in ur pocket if u r visiting this place. btw - appointment by reservation only....book ahead of time.
5
Despite the title of this review, I still have to give Cut 5 stars. It is not cheap, and I am sure you could get something almost as good for a fragment of the cost. However, if you are going to spend this much, it has to be phenomenal, and it was. The steak melts in your mouth, the sides were great (especially the Mac n Cheese) and the service was professional. We had a very personal service and I thoroughly enjoyed spending my birthday here.The atmosphere was also great, a little dark but that is a personal preference. We really enjoyed guessing who all the celebrities were in the pictures on the menus and on the walls
3
We had very good experiences in Cut Las Vegas. We invited friends to have dinner here. The bread are good. Our steak was warm when served to us, but the plates were not heated and the steak became cold quickly. The service is very slow - too many servers who are not well trained.
3
Celebrated a friends going away here and we were not impressed!
Nothing spectacular. Overpriced drinks and food with mediocre service.
5
This is probably my frav place in Singapore. Go for the early dinner menu, $55 for starter and steak with a side. Every time I've been here I've left happy.
4
The service and food was fabulous! Great job. But price is expensive. But its worth it.. Beef was great and wine too. Thumbs up.
5
Located in Marina Bay sands mall, beautiful looking building. We wish the restaurant had the city view. However the food was excellent. We knew it will be costly but we left very happy
4
Loud and not much ambiance
Food very good -- but not as good as I had been expecting
Wait- staff - over attentive , but not in the way

Yes, the meat was wonderful. The least expensive steak was $75 and it comes with absolutely nothing. Just the meat on a plate. I felt sorry for it and added my own cherry tomato garnish.We were a party of 7 and the bill was astronomical because everything is a la carte and had to be ordered separately. So if you order the steak for $75 (the most expensive is $280) expect to order salad and sides separately. I've had steak in other places and perhaps my palate isn't as evolved as that of others but I don't recall anything jaw dropping about my filet.No, I wouldn't go there again. But, if you're a guy set on impressing your date, go right ahead you might get lucky
4
We went this place with my wife when we were visiting singapore. If you like meat and want to have a good experience this is the place for you. Do not expect a fancy view of the city or a very impressive enviroment. This place is about the meat.They have a very good meat menu with the right meats. You wont be disapointed with your selections. They have an ok wine selection.People working in the place are always smiling and their service is very good.The pricing was ok for a $$$$ restaurant. But If you are willing to have a real wagyu experience you need to be ready to pay up.In my opinion this place deserves a 5. I gave it a 4 because of the location + the desert menu is limited. I highly reccomend for a visit when you are in singapore
5
My favourite go to place for cocktails. Be careful though, this place will set you back quite a bit. Sit at the bar and watch the bartenders work their magic. Come after 5 pm for cocktails They can recommend based on your taste, so you won't be overwhelmed with the endless menu.

I had a buddy visiting.He loves a good steak. I Googled. The Cut stands out. Dinning serving only. I turn up at reservation time and was led to my sitting. Place was dim with candles lit tables. In the saucy darkness, shadows floats around. These are the suit cladded waiters and high skirt waitresses. A chilling yet pleasurable ambience. Reasons why you need a good camera and lights :-). Friend was late and a wine connisear decided to bring me to wine taste. A nice touch and also makes me feel important. I taste a few pours and tested the pourer on the wines. He seems to be well informed. Buddy came and we seated. Went for the aged beef and while he grinds the beef, I casually absorbed the tenderloin of darkness while swirling my drink in one hand and a beef cut in another. Action... it would complete the evening if there was a quick smile from the waitresses, just like the Movie. Problem was that all the waiting staff keep smiling :-). The place is truly remarkable and well designed. Now I understand why only dinner dinning. You will walking away feeling you have walked off a Spy Dinning Scene. "Shaken but Not Stirred". Oh Yes, my buddy told me it's the best steak he ever had. The place is good for guest dinning and also if you decided to dine alone. NOT many places can offer such a mix
5
Cut is a great place for carnivores for dinner. Located in the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall. Nearest MRT is Bayfront or ask to be dropped off at Marina Bay Sands Shops by taxi. Extensive meat lovers menu. Top end quality steak but expensive.Great wine list as one one expect. The deserts were interesting and I recommend the Pandan baked Alaska. The Valrhona chocolate desert was disappointing.The service was great. Book in advance to avoid the disappointment of failing to get a table. Very close to the casino and the Art Science Museum and Gardens in the Bay if you are looking to combine dinner with an attraction
5
Excellent service, very delicious, professional meet cook, expensive but worth it
Amazing chocolate souffle
5
Drinks, food, service were all really good. I am such a snob when it comes to service. Our server and everybody else including the manager on duty had vast knowledge of the food and drinks menu. They came to check on out table at very comfortable frequency. My friends and I had lots to catch up on. The team made sure to not intrude our dinner but my wine glass was never empty! Now I understand why my sister loves going to this restaurant when she was in Singapore for work. I was amazed some of the people still recognized and acknowledged her after not visiting for a year because she came back home.

An expat living in Singapore for almost a year, I had never been to CUT until last evening. My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here and were thoroughly impressed with the restaurant in all areas. I have eaten in many different steakhouses on the island but CUT is the best by far in my opinion. Granted, this is not the cheapest option for an evening out, but most people familiar with food options in Singapore, not to mention at Marina Bay Sands, plus the famous celebrity chef name means an expensive price tag. The service staff was excellent; friendly, attentive and knowledgable about what they serve. Upon entry we were greeted by three impeccably dressed hostesses who set the tone of excellent service for the evening. We ordered a petit filet (170g) and a prime ribeye (395g) with side orders (large enough for sharing) of tempura onion rings and sautÃ©ed broccolini. In addition to two glasses of a Wolfgang Puck cabernet sauvignon and three Kirin Ichiban beers, we also had a litre of Fiji Water for the table. Our staff were kind enough to prepare a special anniversary dessert. Our bill came to a total of $375 including the service charge and GST. Expensive, yes, but very reasonable considering what we ordered, the service we received, and of course the fact that it is a celebrity chef's restaurant located in one of the most expensive cities in Asia if not the world. Will definitely visit again

Our great experience started from the reservation. We were handled professionally throughout. We were greeted very warmly by their enthusiastic receptionist. We were then whisked away to our table. We requested for a potato puree which our little son enjoyed so much, at no charge at all. I had a scallop and my wife had a king crab, both were great but the king crab was better. I then had a UK sirloin and my wife had a pork chop. And to be honest we enjoyed the pork chop better than the sirloin. The pork chop was really juicy and moist. We also had cream spinach and wild mushroom as the sides. We felt that the mushroom was too sweet but the spinach was really tasty. For the dessert we had a "coconut ice cream layer cake durian look", which tasted unbelievable. A must try.What really impressed us was the service and hospitality of the staff. They really looked after us well, always asking what we need, asking us about the food. We were treated like a VIP. A special shout to a woman server with glasses (did not get her name). She was really attentive to my wife. One time, our 9 month old baby was crying and my wife breastfed him. When she saw my wife, she quickly look for cloth for my wife to cover. A shout should also be made to two male server, one who lives in JB and the other was a large figure. These three people elevate our experience beyond dining in the restaurant. Thank you for looking after us. We shall come back

I have dined at a number of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants over the years - Hawaii, Los Angeles, The Dorchester (UK) and Singapore, on a few occasions, at the CUT at the Marina Bay Sands, being the venue for this review. Whilst I have always had an enjoyable time at Mr Puck's establishment, it's not a destination of choice for me, given the availability and high standard of steak houses competing in the Puck organisation's theatre of activity. Reaching the front door of the CUT at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, requires a serious walk through a high-end retail promenade, boasting some of the best known brands and world famous names. The Centre is a hive of activity, with lots of buzz, noise and day trippers.On arrival at the CUT, we were enthusiastically welcomed, offered a seat at the bar, and shortly escorted to our table. The room is tastefully furnished, service is attentive, with well dressed, impeccably groomed assistants.CUT is expensive; I was not disappointed.The two of us ordered white asparagus, tuna tartare, butter lettuce, poussin, prime New York steak, broccoli, cream spinach, and potato puree. Included, were a bottle of Fiji water at S$14 and a glass of Hall Merlot at S$30.The food was attractively plated and perfectly prepared. The white asparagus was firm and tasty; the tuna tartare, presented in a pyramid shape, which is creative. The grilled chicken and steak were cooked as ordered, firm, tasty and enjoyable. The salad and vegetable dishes hit the spot, complementing all in all a very nice evening out.The cost, excluding drinks came to S$283 - by adding the drinks, a 10% service charge and GST at 7%, the bill came to S$400. Annoyingly, they leave a space on the invoice for a tip. It was a good night out, with a restaurant filled with elegant, happy diners, all having a good time. We shall return
5
Me and my boyfriend had been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for a long time and it lived up to all our expectations. As we live in Singapore, we eat out a lot and have therefore eaten at many very good restaurants. However, we both agreed that this is by far the best meal we have ever had. The stake was so tender, the vegetables were super delicious and the service was perfect. The prices are slightly high, but worth it. In addition, we had a wonderful waiter named Marilou who was able to create a memorable evening for us by delivering outstanding service. We highly recommend this restaurant for its delicious food and wonderful staff
5
I came here with my wife. It's very good steak and service. Try to make reservation especially at weekend.They will nicely explain to you the steaks are from which country and what kind of texture you like. They will ask you what way you like it cook too before suggesting which type is better. You have to order side dishes separately such as fries, mash potato, grill vegetables etc. the meal comes with some breads. I think the food is great and ambience is nice for a top steak house
4
I have eaten at Cut several times, entertaining Business partners as well as my family. Last night I went with my wife for a romantic evening. Being a Tuesday it wasn't that busy but there were a few people in the Bar. We ordered drinks but they took more than 15 mins to arrive and we had to ask several times.We were seated at a booth table which was fine. Dinner was up to standard and we had a good bottle of wine. Our bill was substantial but obviously not enough because upon leaving as we struggled to manoeuvre out of the table nobody assisted us and we didn't even receive a "goodbye" from any of the numerous staff we walked past. Good food and wine spoilt by a bad taste in our mouths at the end.
3
Quality of food is good but chef seems to try and impress by adding as many ingredients to a dish as possible... A lot of the quality of the food is 'smothered' by an overload of unnecessary ingredients that kill the fine flavour of core ingredient
5
The restaurant setting was fantastic and it is conveniently located in the Mall at the Marina Bay Sands. The decor was beautiful and food very well done. Tried the True Wagyu beef actually out of Japan (specified on the menu and confirmed by the price per ounce from a reputable company) for once which is (nearly) impossible to get (or so I thought) outside of Japan. It was an amazing cut of beef though it would have been nice if it came with a bit more. All of the sides were great as well and the wine and beer offerings were good. Would certainly go there again.
4
if you feel having some clatter while everyone talking and drinking then this is the place as it gives you the vibrancy if you want an evening out.
5
The ambiance was great, food was excellent , service great too.. expencive but it worth it . Wine selection is wonderful
5
We stopped here for drinks and desserts. There were only 4 of us, but for one drink and one dessert each, the bill was in the US$200 range! It was a fun experience but be prepared to splurge.
5
I came here with my wife and daughter. It's very good steak and service. There is a dress code. Try to make reservation especially weekend. First they will give you the menu and present you lots of different steaks cut in a trolley. They will nicely explain to you the steaks are from which country and what kind of texture you like, for example for more fats or melts in your mouth they will suggest marble Kobe beef from Japan. They will ask you what way you like it cook too before suggesting which type is better. You have to order side dishes separately such as fries, mash potato, grill vegetables etc. the meal comes with some breads. We order a wagyu, another steak and grill fish and 2 sides and drinks. The bill is about S$700. I think the food is great and ambience is nice for a top steak house
5
Let's start with that ; it is an expensive to place but you got with for your money! I can enjoy food court dinners as well as gastro restaurants. I did what I mostly not do but got to this place by internet recommendation. Wanted a chill place with good food, service and relaxed attitude after eating 2 weeks noodles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Service was extremely good. I asked for kibe beeg but didn't hsf it anymore but proposed me another exclusive meat which was astonishing ( ask for Hokkaido snow beef). Smelts in your mouth. Anyway, can talk a lot about this place but its just an exclusive place with exclusive service and food which I strongly recommend for special occasions
1
Took my clients from work for dinner here thinking it will be a memorable evening of fine food and service but I was wrong. Food was disappointing and the service was even worse. After taking our order we we left alone for over 20 mins without water refill! Our steak was not worth the price we paid for. Very disappointing evening and i would not go back nor recommend this place to anyone
4
The food at this restaurant was high quality and beautifully presented! The meat was fantastic, the different sides very tasty and the portions were big. The desserts was to die for, super delicious and so beautiful. The service was excellent until we had our main courses, then they seem to ´forget´ us on and off. We had to ask for the dessert menu and they never asked us if we wanted any tea/coffee. The dinner was very expensive but worth it for a special occasion. Too bad the restaurant is inside a shopping mall though, it would have been even better if the restaurant had some nice views
5
Return visit to Puk's, the steak is simply AWESOME, it doesn't get better. Yes it's pricey but for Singapore & compared to other venues in this range it is good value. This is a busy venue, but the service is amazing & staff are very helpful. Exceptional wine list with knowledgable staff to assist
5
Went to dinner with co workers. Avg price is 225.00 Singapore dollars, not sure where they get that since our bill for three came to 1800.00 with tip. We started with baked breads that were excellent and a bottle of Barolo that was seriously tasty. I had two separate fillets, one buddy had the 990 gram Ribeye and my other bud had the triple American taster. We all had different sides I went for the polenta with Parmesan. The main meal was as good as any I've had. I would have maybe had steaks done medium versus medium rare but they were still exquisite. Dessert for me was chocate soufflé with creme fresh and gelato followed by a double espresso. We finished up the night with some Blackjack at the casino and headed home. Definitely one of the best meals I've had
4
we visited this famous glorious restaurant as the culinary highlight of our family visit to Singapore. The restaurant itself looks gorgeous the service was professional and good.The food? well it was tasty the fillet minion stake was among the best I have eaten but very expensive and very small. the same for the lobster too small and terribly expensive.The only dish we ate that was not smaller than the usual and not extremely over prices was the stuffed chicken - but as good as it was a chicken is a chicken !$12 for An espresso! same foe a bottle of mineral water! would one believe?My conclusion is that the food is very tasty the dishes are too small and very highly overprice
5
The food was superb and the service was excellent. Particularly Marilou who was exemplary. She provided top notch service and along with the delicious food, it was a true delight dining at The CUT.
5
Excellent Service. Great Wine selection. And the steaks..... OMG were fabulous! But, the sticker price might shock you. Great for special events or entertaining clients.
4
The quality of the beef is as high as the price on the menu. Delicious..
Cocktails so-so which is a shame...
Wish they have good people who does better.
5
Wolfgang gets it right. The steak selection here is amazing. I was practically drooling on myself when they brought out the cuts of beef that you can choose from. My steak was cooked perfectly and the selection of sauces was great, even though the steak didn't even need sauce. The service was excellent and the sides and bread were tasty too. One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. 5 out of 5 stars easily. If you enjoy a good steak, then this is the plac

I had high expectations when dining here with a group of 10-odd guests for dinner. We arrived early and were offered a seat at the bar while they prepared our table. So far so good. Then we were sat down at a small-ish round table, which I found odd and commented to the waiter, but he insisted it was the correct one. Only after most of were seated did another waiter come over and tell us we were seated at the wrong table, creating some awkwardness as all our guests then had to move again. During dinner, a colleague ordered a drink which was only sent over 15 minutes later after his second reminder to the staff, who looked apologetic but clueless. The real kicker came when no one topped up our guests' water glasses; to the extent one had to ask for a refill. And when it came, the waiter topped up her glass alone and no one else's! By that point I was bamboozled. My colleagues and I exchanged looks but didn't make a scene to avoid awkwardness to our guests.The food and ambiance was good, but given the significant spend of 300+ per pax I expected far better service. And I should point out the restaurant was not particularly crowded that evening. We've avoided Cut from then on moved on to better establishments

Steaks were excellent. One rib eye and one fillet. These were the cheap end of the range but they were still excellent, both in taste and tenderness. Excellent wine list to accompany. Did not have my first choice but a good second. Ch. Leoville Barton 2005. Very expensive, of course, but you get what you pay for

We had the pleasure of having the Chef's Menu that was expertly done by Chef Greg and service was overseen by a group of highly professional and passionate waiters. Amazing food, I must highlight the Alaskan King Crab Louis, and impeccable service made our dinner an unforgettable one. Thanks to Sophian, Rasul and Angie who took great care of the four of us as we celebrated a double occasion. Highly recommended, looking forward to coming back *hint-hint husband. ;

Wonderful experience. We found Excellent service and very generous portion sizes . I ordered chicken and they served me a whole chicken which was then cut into pieces . It was spectacular but a bit wasteful. The side dishes were outstanding especially the creamed spinach. Trendy setting with a great atmosphere. Would go back

I have walked past Cut a number of times and have always heard good things about it. I decided to pop in after my walk in my gym gear and was immediately greeted by their friendly staff. As I was not particularly hungry but just wanted to experience dining here, I sat and ate at the bar area. I was lucky as I got there just before happy hour ended so managed to get one of the recommended drinks. "Rough Love" was delicious and would recommend cocktail lovers who like Japanese wine to get this. Beautifully presented and strong. The steal was cooked just right. Will definitely be back and hopefully I will be hungry next time so I can try more of their menu selection, including the amazing looking and very tempting chocolate souffle

My wife and I recently relocated to Singapore and we decided to celebrate at a restaurant which would feel like a treat. We've eaten at many fine dinning and well established renowned restaurants throughout the world. So going to Wolfgang's CUT was on the list.Overall the experience was good, the service though was the best we have every had, in any restaurant anywhere. The amount of attention was perfect and the staff very accommodating, and it was nice to have our sides dished up when running low. The only flaw was the food. I enjoyed the steak (although I would have preferred an organic or grass fed option). We had several sides all of which were good but not great (blue cheese sauce, onion rings, brussels sprouts). I would have expected great not just because of the price but the name too, however CUT fell short. BUT Singapore is expensive at the best of times so hence 4 stars
5
After few weeks travelling in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, we landed in Singapore end went to CUT. What a experience. Food was simply wonderful, service was great and the atmosphere was fantastic. I strongly recommend it.
5
Oh oh oh! The steak is fabulous make sure that you will not miss this restaurant when you travel to Singapore

Yupe, we heard about Mr. Puck since quite awhile and werent going to give him a visit in NYC that soom yet, so we dared ourselves getting a table for two at this very restaurant.It was packed. But the atmosphere is pretty.My betterhalf and I ordered 2 Dried Age Steaks with some side orders and desserts. Everything but the DA Steaks could impress us. Probably the long way to Singapore or the chef at the grill?We wont give Cut another visit nor we would recommend this place ... Its just not worth the money
3
We have been all over the world trying different restaurants and yes I'm a very big critic but I believe to be honest with my opinion.1st the service was good not too formal but good2nd when booking there is no price on the food until you go to the restaurant and sit down3rd We paid around $160 for a steak which is pretty high but quality was very average 4th price overall is very high to give an example bottle of Fiji water will cost $14 and no it's wasn't a 1 litre.Overall price is very high for your return but you are eating at a celebrities restaurant
5
This is worth every penny. Fancy and elegant but they also do good food. We had a T-bone for two with salad and it was out of this world. We almost couldnt finish it, it was big! But the flavors were just right.The salad was good too. The service was 5 stars as well. Will always remember this meal
5
The real stars of this restaurant are not the ones hanging on the walls, but the Japanese Kobe Waygu steaks! If you can afford it go for this, true melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. Dark seared on the outside and pink on the inside. Doesn’t need any sides and could be enjoyed by itself, but the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Smoked Bacon and Pearl Onions are also excellent. Very easy to over order sides and starters as they all sound tempting, make sure you leave room for the main attraction.Even though it is a steak restaurant they can whip up a delicious vegetarian pasta, this is not on the menu.A close runner-up for star of this restaurant is the cocktails, made by some of the best bartenders in Singapore. If you don’t want to have the full dining experience you can sit at the bar and have snacks while working through the extensive cocktail menu, favorites such as Rough Love and Pandora’s Box. Yet to have a bad cocktail and we would have been there over a dozen times. My partner has dined at Cut in Beverly Hills and we both agree that the décor at the Singapore restaurant is much better. The bar is also a destination in itself in Singapore, where it’s more of a holding bar in LA.Yet to find a better steak restaurant in Singapore
5
Despite our casual dress and having no reservation, we were treated very well and made to feel at home. Found one of our favorite wines on the menu and had the best delicious steak and sides we have had in recent memory. Waitstaff was well informed, attentive and helpful. Yes, it is pricey but we did not regret spending the money. It was a memorable and absolutely delicious meal. Polenta exquisite and Brussels sprouts flavorful and scrumptious
5
Finally found an opportunity to come here for dinner. Upon entering the dining room, realised how dark it was. Asked for iced water and got it easily, nice of them not to push for still/sparklingOrdered and shared the bone marrow started which was recommended by the staff. It was ok, but as you have to eat it with brioche bread, it was too carby for me, especially during dinner. There were already breadsticks in the beginning, then they offered 4 varieties of breadNow the main event. We had the USDA Prime steaks, fillet mignon and ribeye. Both were very good indeed. We shared the cream spinach with fried egg and that was a good comboDessert we shared the banana cream pie with 2 glasses of sweet Australian noble one. Not badOverall good service too. Probably in the top 3 of all steakhouses in Singapore
5
I just been to MBS to visit friend who works there and I didn't mean to go for the restaurant. How was a luckily me that my friend was invited me to have some drinks at the "CUT"She was told me that this is the most expensive bar, the best wine cellar, the incredible foods, cocktails bla bla bla. And it's totally truth after I had negrowni with snack (Tuna Tarta) there are amazing ! Also the ambience was pax and full not even 1 seat available at bar area. Highly recommend this place !
5
we've had a fabulous night at CUT. Had wagyu beef and tried some others. The appetizers and the sides were great too. Also the famous souffle lived up to expectations.I didn't know how to eat some of the appetizers since they were new to me. But thanks to friendly staff, especially to Ms. Tracy. She explained me the specifications of the food and showed me how to properly eat it.She also helped us to choose a great wine.It was a great dinner and i hope i will be able to go there again soon
4
I have experience many time there, and just decided to share my experience.
Cut is more than the steak house... the starter are very fine and delicate, and also the cocktail are just wonderful.
As all steak house it is expensive but definitely worth it.
5
We had an amazing experience here as from the appetizer, Kobe Beef till the dessert was perfect. Really an eye opening.
5
we had a lovely dining experience. very friendly hostesses at the welcome desk. we truly felt welcome.
the food is spectacular. we loved the interior design of the main dining room. wonderful!
we will definitely go back for a special evening . . .
5
had a pleasant evening at Cut, from the phone call to make a booking to the moment I left the service was sufficient and very friendly. I made a reservation for 9pm as I was alone and had meetings throughout the day. I dressed down a little as I wanted to see the reaction of someone walking into this nice establishment and if they would be treated the same. Long pants but with a t shirt. I was shown to my table quickly and was given the menu, nothing was explained on the menu until I asked, but I was fine with that. I ordered the Australian rib eye on the bone which was $120 I'm willing to pay good prices for good quality, had the potato purée as a side, the steak was 580gr so didn't want to order anything else. I ordered some water and they bought out 1litre bottle of Fiji water, which is fine but I think they should have an option of 500 or 600mls for people dining alone, also the price was over the top for water $14. Places like this should be offering free water, especially when the water is fine to drink in Singapore. While waiting for the steak I ordered a glass of red, which was served in a white wine glass, they served me fresh bread while waiting for the steak, bread was very nice and they had 4 different varieties, don't fill yourself on the bread as you want to leave room for the meat. Steak finally arrived,it did take quite a while but it was worth the wait. Was cooked just the way I asked for and was very tender, potatoes were nice and creamy and went well with the steak. Service was constantly making sure I was ok and if the food was good. After the steak I skipped desert as I was very satisfied and didn't want to over eat, I had an espresso $7 mind you, way over priced. I then moved to the bar for an Americano to help settle the food. Bar staff were friendly and gave sufficient service. Overall I had a very enjoyable meal and experience and would go back again. The points I have written down are not to discourage anyone from going, it's more for the management to improve on something's. also something's are reasonably priced but others are just way over priced, eg starters, coffee, water, sides for me the steaks are full over flavour but mind did take almost 20mins and I ordered medium rare, if I was told before hand that it takes time again customers don't mind. I'm still rating a very good and will be back.
3
This restaurant is not worth it. The service was very slow, the food… not worth the money. I bet there are better places to dine in Singapore.We ordered a medium rare filet mignon and after a 40 min wait it was overcooked… simply not acceptable. I won´t return
5
My mother and I had a fabulous birthday dinner at Cut. We were there on Tues 27th Jan. My mother is a real foodie (likewise!) and I lived in Australia for over 18 years, so I've been exposed to top quality fresh produce and some of the world's best restaurants. (I even did my Masters thesis on the restaurant industry.....so I guess you could say I know my stuff).In the current market where the service industry is suffering from a shortage of staff, let alone good staff, CUT was certainly refreshing with the right number of staff and also right quality of staff. We were very well looked after by David, Teo and Hari - so much so we didnt really need to ask for anything, from water being regularly topped up, replacement bread was offered, etc. This type of service is often found in high quality western restaurants overseas and almost unseen in Singapore. Glynn was overseeing the restaurant and it was a very nice touch towards the end of the meal for her to pop over to check that everything was going well. Food wise, there was not one bad dish at all and we had several! The mini Kobe sliders had the right crisp to the brioche and good quality meat was used. The Oxtail Bouillon was smply enjoyable. Something warming, comfort food. The pork belly had the right balance of sweet, salty, crunchiness and tenderness to it. The real stand out for me was the amazing lobster! It was a full sized lobster, cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth heavenly goodness! I'm still thinking about it as I write this review (completely independent and unpaid). The lobster came with a collection of condiments but the truth was that it was amazing just on its own, unhidden behind the usual "lots of sauce" style of Singaporean seafood cooking. When you have truly fresh good quality produce, you let the produce speak for itself. The same applied to the 300+ days porterhouse steak. But by that stage, I was a little too full to enjoy it to the right extent! LOL! But it was an excellent steak!The last stand out dish was the creamed spinach with fried egg! Wow, savoury heaven with an excellent balance of tastes and texture. Quite frankly, I'd happily come back again to attack the lobster and the spinach.....is it possible that spinach can taste THIS awesome?! The broccolini and potato puree were good, but man that spinach...MmMmmmIt's probably a "boring" review raving about an excellent experience but it truly was. I couldnt fault the service - from the pleasant greeting by the two well dressed, polished young ladies at the door, to a couple of hours of consistently great table service, to a clearly highly experienced manager, running a "tight ship" as the saying goes. The back of house was certainly living up to their reputation. I'd have to honestly say that if I had to pick one restaurant kitchen to visit, this would be IT.I've been to many posh restaurants and this I can be proud to say was a VERY memorable experience and I'm so very glad that we came here for our birthday celebration. I guess if I was going to be very picky and if there was one thing I would change, it would be to change the style of music. They were playing rock music and although it wasnt loud, I would say it wasnt quiet background music either. But look, i could still easily hear the table conversation but not quite my style of restaurant background music. However, music is a personal thing. Well done Glynn and her team. Will definitely be back for more. Can't wait. (BTW The cocktail and wine list alone looked very impressive and worth exploring too.

I have visited Cut three times since arriving in Singapore 6 months ago - that should be testament enough to its quality given how many other restaurants are on my list to get through here in Singapore.Each and every time the service and food have been 5 stars, if you are looking for amazing steak, wine and cocktails this place is for you.Do not let its location in the shopping mall put you off; once you step in you will forget you are there; the dim and dark setting coupled with the celebrity portraits whisks you away :)A little tip, if you visit between 6pm-7pm you can get the early dinner menu, which is two courses for $69, significantly cheaper than the al la carte menu but you get a great starter and superb steak. To compare, the first time I came with my wife we easily spent $800 but that did include a great bottle of champagne. What we love to do is just prop up at the cocktail bar and either order from the early dinner menu or they have a small cocktail food menu. The cocktail waiters are very skilled and feel free to order off-menu. “Old fashioned” are not on the menu but the waiter created one of the best tasting old fashioneds I have ever had. Will visit again without a doubt but I am trying to persuade my wife to let us go somewhere else… :
5
Went here with my friends from Seattle and Sydney, A weekday and it was almost full as early as 6:45pm, but managed to get the last table available. The starters alone already has impressed me, then came the Kobe Beef!!!! Its awesomeness to the max, add to it the huge selection of wines you dont easily see in other restos in SG, plus their cocktail selections are pretty cool too. Will definitely come back
5
Was here for dinner on a weekday, as it was a special occasion they seated us at the booth, away from the crowd. Havent been to many restaurants in SG who can do a medium rare steak to perfection, but CUT is one of them. Very very well executed, i will definitely be coming back to satisfy my steak cravings very soon
5
We came here december 2013 and had a amazing dinner. First time ever for a Kobe beef. Stunning service, great wine suggestions and then the food.Its a chapter of its own in taste. Unreal.The starter was a awakening moment. Then came the Kobe beef. Superior quality served with a quite small amount of side items. One of the guests in our group had a quite simple pasta - the best I ever had - se said! Coffe and chocolate fondant and it just came on in the same legue. Absolute worldclass. This was a moment in heaven for all the four of us. Yes, its expensive - for real. But If you going to pay a big amount for One dinner this might be the chosen one.

The steak was absolutely superb, and the service was just brilliant. The design and atmosphere of the restuarant is great.

I had an amazing evening here at Cut. The steak was absolutely superb, and the service was just brilliant!
The design and atmosphere of the restuarant is great
5
Probably one of the most pricy steak in Singapore, but the money spent was worthwhile. steak cooked to perfection coupled with delicious sides.
4
Expensive but worth it. Just go for the most expensive beef. Any other wouldn't make the cut. Service was good but lighting was pretty dim. Would recommend for date nights and special occasions.
5
Great choice of steaks from US, Australia or Japan. I had a great rib tenderloin perfectly cooked and very tender and juicy. Nice wine list, generally overpriced and offering not the best vintages but some good/fair deals if you know wines a but and looks through it all. I had a very nice Beringer Cab 2007 (half bottle) which they kindly decanted on my request. The restaurant can be lively with some music, people and the bar next to it, but overall it is a great experience and I would go back. The service was exceptional, very dedicated and friendly staff
5
We've been visited CUT for a few times and it says it all. The first time we were there was when they're just open around 2006 and we enjoyed our dinner. And after our first visit we've been there for a few times. The restaurant has a good athmosphere and they play a cosy lounge music but it could differ from time to time. My favourite was their mozzarella puff as their in house tid-bits and their signature chocolate soufflÃ© was to die for. The steaks of course very good. Definitely recommended to go for a very good steak
5
A great meal, living up to all our expectations. Yes, it's in a shopping mall, yes, it's expensive, yes, it's a little dark (some would say atmospheric) - but the steak is fabulous - the best my wife had ever tasted - and the experience was special: a perfect family dinner.The sides are also superb: special mention for the roasted brussel sprouts, and the service is excellent - attentive but unobtrusive.We're already planning our next visit
5
Simply a very good steak. Well made with a variety of choices for sauces and sides. Staff also courteous and friendly. Good atmosphere and location next to Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is quite expensive though, so wouldn't come here often (will try the Dubai one though). But would recommend if you're going for an anniversary or date and trying to impress or get laid. ;

I have been to CUT a couple of times and I have to say the food is amazing. If you're looking to try something good but concerned about the price I'd say to go for the filet mignon. Side dishes tastes great as well and not to forget the breadsticks they serve when they sit you at the table is equally yummy!We enjoyed the service the initial couple of times and the staff were usually very friendly and took care of us really well. However, we recently went there again on a Friday night and to our disappointment the staff did not seem to be as enthusiastic and friendly as before. We had ordered mac and cheese for one of our side dishes and when one of them was serving it to us, she dropped a scoop on the floor. She did apologize to us, however I found it pretty ridiculous given this is a top-notch fine dining restaurant.When we left the restaurant, the staff who walked past us never bothered to say good bye. I know these comments may sound very minute but overall we just did not feel very welcomed the last time we were there and that definitely affected our image of CUT. Nevertheless, excellent food, I don't think I will ever have steak as good as CUT, but it would be better if the staff could smile a little more
5
This is the whole package. I know the pricing can be daunting, but it really has to be viewed in the context of quality, service, taste and atmosphere. This restaurant delivers on all fronts. We had dinner for four, shared starters, to full for desserts, had great wine (well priced)! whats sets the dinner off and finished the night though is the cocktail bar. These boys really do top and tail the evening. We had great fun - again. Ok we have been here 6/7 times but it does deliver. Dinner for four, with wine and a few cocktails and we where out for $1200. The best 1200 I've spent in a long time
5
This is my benchmark of a steak restaurant. I know what I like & this place is the best I have experienced.
The Wagyu is exceptional & even after a dozen visits, I have never been disappointed. Although expensive, it is a must try.
5
We went here at the last minute as we had to change our plans, and boy were we not disappointed. Tuna starter, followed by awesome beef for 2, along with Tempura onion rings, fries and greens. Great wine as well. Great atmosphere. Only criticism is that this is eye-wateringly expensive for a steak meal, but, if you love your steak, you won't be disappointed. Definitely up there with one of the best steak meals we have had
5
Just before we went to Singapore, CUT Singapore was featured on a TV food channel and that's it, me and my hubby decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary in this exquisite restaurant!The restaurant is so chic and elegant! The staffs were so friendly and made us feel at home! We had the Austrian oxtail bouillon with bone marrow dumplings, blue crab and shrimp "Louise" spicy tomato-horseradish as 1st course, 1 word - stunning! The food was prepared with the finest quality and it was just delish! For the main course, it's none other than their signature well-known steak. It's the best beef cooked to perfection we ever had. Paired with 2009 Tempranillo, it's just beautiful! We were too full for dessert and when my hubby asked for the bill, we had a little surprise from CUT - we were treated with lovely fruits and berries sorbet wit a candle sent to our table for our anniversary! How lovely! It was definitely one of the best restaurant with exquisite food and service we had been to. We will go back again!
5
We went there even after getting mixed reviews by friends ... from "outstanding" to "over rated". As a family of foodies, we just had to go see for ourselves. We knew it was going to be expensive, so we picked a special occasion for the visit.It's located in the Marina Bay Sands complex, the iconic structure overlooking the marina bay in downtown Singapore. For locals, it's a bit of a hike to the hotel, given its location.We ordered the American Wagyu and what can I say ???It was outstanding. I have rarely, if ever, had such amazing quality of meat.Yes, it's pricey, but if you like steaks, THIS is the place to got to
4
I didn't quite realize that this restaurant was right in the middle of a mall without a great view...a bit disappointing with all the great options Singapore has to offer. If you don't mind that, the food was quite good although extremely expensive although I guess that is to be expected. We only had starters as we had younger children and there were less options for our friends who are vegetarian than it appeared online. Having said all that, the service was really great, the fresh baked bread & pretzel rolls yummy and if you are ok eating in a high-end mall, you can try it out
5
This is a must-visit if you are a lover of fine food and damn good meat. I chose the tasting plate and thoroughly enjoyed every single bite. The matching sauces were also perfection. The staff were lovely and could not be faulted! Honestly, the best steak of my life
5
I knew that cut would be expensive and hoped that it would deliver. It did. As previous posts have stated, the service is understated consideration. Guiding one through the maze of options and extras. In terms of taste, I admit to being rather pleased that the beef that I buy from the local organic farm shop in Worcester is not too dissimilar in taste and texture. The difference being that you have a chef that really knows how to cook beef (for the record I do cook a good steak), this was better. The extras.The breads at the beginning of the meal were on par with the best french bolangerie. And the cocktails, fantastic with a great range and breath of different tastes that you rarely see or experience. We could have happily spent the night just working our way through the cocktails list. The wine selection is superb, many of which I have tasted previously, but at a fraction of the charges here. I would like to make a personally acknowledgement to our waiter Marvin; probably one of the best waiters we have encountered. He unusually, even knew how to pronounce my name correctly. And a specially thank you to the staff for noting my husbands poor eyesight and accommodating the fact and for my birthday surprise. With thanksProfessor K M and Mrs Eva Brunson
5
Great restaurant, great service excellent wine and I think the best steak I have had to date. It was not cheap but they say you get what you pay for and this case it was certainly worth the money. We had a tasting plate of 3 steaks one being the Hyogo Kobe which absolutely melted in your mouth. This came with 3 sauces which honestly weren't needed as the meat itself was so tasty. We had some onion rings as they had been recommended and they didn't disappoint either. Would certainly recommend to anyone and will go back for sure next time we are in Singapore
3
I have been to this restaurant with my daughter which we have to have reservation at 21.30 round. We went to the restaurant and found out so many people cuing. We have expected a excellent meal that night. Then the menu have coming for us to order. The menu is quite interesting with various kinds of premium steaks from many places including some combination steaks which are very exciting. Somehow when the food comes, they look fine but the tastes are not tasty as expected. Actually, first of all, they have not cooked as ordered. I have ordered medium rare but it comes out to be medium to medium well. And the way they cook does not meet standard of steak I have ever had. I am the type of who fancy steak so much. I felt disappointed not because of the expensive with the food which is expected before visiting but the quality of foods we had
5
Let me start out by saying this is not the average family restaurant. It is not a cheap meal by any standards. After saying that, you get what you pay for. The service is excellent and all staff are very attentive and friendly. The food is some of the best I have had, I started with the pork belly starters and then the NZ aged steak, the pork belly was incredibly tender and had so much flavor and my steak was cooked perfectly and really didn't need the steak sauce on the side. The only things I can comment on that were not completely positive is that Southern Comfort is not an exotic beverage, why is it I was told "we just sold out" time and time again. The bar facilities here were extremely well stocked with everything else except this, maybe due to the fact I am not a wine drinker I was not looked upon favorably.The other interesting thing to note when paying the bill I attempted to leave a tip in the total credit card amount, one of the staff was watching me and told me that is not acceptable and I needed to leave a cash tip otherwise they would not get it,I was then required to amend the credit card payment slip and leave cash???Overall, excellent service and food
5
The restaurant is very beautiful. The staff is friendly. Breads are very delicious speciality the onion bread. The most important is the meat. It is absolutely delicious. The prices are high but it is the same as good restaurants in Singapore.
5
Professionals at work from start to finish. 10/10 Quality and finish you would expect from the finest in New York
4
Great late night cocktails. If youa re stuck in the mall at MBS it's worth it to stop in for some excellent signature cocktails.
5
The staffs were very friendly and their service was awesome!We were served with bread and cheese sticks when we sat down. The staff will come around and ask if you want more bread.Staffs are also attentive and take the initiative to help us take a photo.The food was good, especially the mushroom. We ordered a ribeye and salad to share and the kitchen chew actually separated into two portion for us. Thumbs up!It can be pretty crowded and noisy during the weekends so do make a reservation.We will sure be back for more
3
The restaurant to begin with is inside a shopping mall..,elegant but dark and boring for my taste. But I must say it has some very nice pictures of famous celebrities on the walls that remind Time Magasin pictures. Service is poor ( we waited several minutes to even get attention when we sat down) . But thank god they have a very polite and good manager who helped us with everything. Prices..? Very expensive for what you get (but this we knew before we got there). And finally ..food .. Well we tried two different stakes some side dishes and sauces. Side dishes (caramelised onions/French fries etc) were terrible. The sauses ..disappointing too. The meet was of course good quality and well cooked BUT nothing that I will remember or recommend to anyone. Dont waste your money (unless you have lots). There are better places out there for stakes.
4
Enjoyed the pre-theatre menu with my wife. Good value for money and the wine accompanying was also up to scratch. Service was par for the course but what let us down was the dessert option. Not that it was bad, but the banana cream cake/creme brûlée did not match the high standard set by the first 2 courses. I guess when you come to a steak restaurant, stop there. Be happy leaving with a beefy taste in your mouth
5
While I am an American and I did a fair taste of local food in Singapore, I had to visit one of my favorite steak houses - CUT. I was not disappointed one bit. Being a solo patron, I decided to eat in the bar which turned out fantastic. Was able to strike up a conversation with a great couple and enjoyed their company while being pampered by the bartender, the cocktail waitress and even the General Manager. The appetizers were amazing - had some local tastes as well as the consistent ones popular in the states. Hokkaido Scallop was the local starter which was dreamy, Blue Fin Tuna Tartare was also a hit and I even got what seemed to be a crab cake that was not on the menu - scrumptious. The filet I got for dinner was cooked to perfection and the creamed spinach was a perfect match. Wes, your staff is fantastic and I really appreciate the great service - food was excellent, but the service was over-the-top. Will tell everyone that a visit to CUT in Singapore is well worth it
5
The prices on the menu may be a bit surprising, but the quality of the food (and the service) makes it worth every penny. And believe it or not, their mac & cheese was unreal. Crazy good. Even the bread was incredible. I rarely ever take more than one bite of the bread given to me at restaurants, but I had two pieces at Cut (and I was quite tempted to eat a 3rd piece).Probably not the place that you would go to on a weekly basis, but it's perfect for special occasions. It was definitely one of the top 3 steaks I've had in my lifetime. I had the Wagyu filet and my knife almost just fell through the steak. Great experience

Me and my family had dinner at Cut MBS 3 days ago. We were 5 persons eating that time. Only 3 persons eating the beef carpacio and scallop carpacio. And about 6 hours afterwards, the 3 persons (includes my husband) get a very bad diarrhea, my husband's is the worst. He has been on and off to bathroom for more than 10 times in 24 hours. We called the Cut and tell them what happen. They apologizing and keep apologizing. We just want to let others know that please be more caution ordering the raw food!!!
5
We eat in all The Cut restaurants, London 45 Park Lane being my favourite and LA at the Bel Air Hotel our second choice, Give the one in Beverly Hills at the Pretty Women Hotel a miss as its dreadful the worst in fact. I have to say that this one is now our second favourite its just the same as the one in London from the food to the excellent service, who ever the Manager is of this one keep up the good work
5
Cut in singapore have some off the best cuts of meet i ever tried. Excellent food, excellent service. Probably worth the price, and that is saying something. The meal was exactly as ordered including the cooking of the steaks.
5
In the case of Wolf Gang Puck's restaurant Cut (Singapore) it only takes one visit to form a habit. In my opinion, in regards to fine dining, one thing separates a great restaurant from a restaurant I attend repeatedly. I'll give ya a hint, it's not the food. Yes the food is the drive, but let's be honest if your knighted with the title of fine dining and all masses collectively agree with the association then you have to separate yourself from the rest using other means. Once again, just one guy's opinion here, but I'm going to list some of those means that Cut uses to surpass other restaurants residing within it's weight class.Attention to detail - 10Visually aesthetics - 10Ability to make you want to freeze time - 10Staffing (from every tier) - 10Last but not least cuisine - 10Bottom line is you're going to Cut, the question is how many times a week.Thanks Jeanine for providing such a great dining experience for me and my co-workers

We went here on our first night in Singapore. The staff was super friendly and attentive, almost to a point where some might get uncomfortable. The food is really great, and the standard is top notch. It's a steak restaurant, so the menu is mostly about meat, and great meat at that. Everything we ordered was delicious and perfectly prepared. The chocolate suffle is to die for! Only thing that one could complain about is that it's overpriced, even compared internationally (Europe/USA).I'd say you end up paying 30% more than you should. But hey, it's a great meal, and if money is no issue, then by all means go

When we lived in Singapore a few years ago, CUT was our favourite place for dinner and drinks. The food is excellent and the service USED to be the best in Singapore. Recently we returned for dinner and found the food just as good as we remembered, but sadly the service has declined and we found ourselves waiting a long time for our meal and drinks. No one even bothered to check on us once we received our food. This is a VERY expensive place to eat, for the money the food is worth it, but I would expect a more attentive staff

We had 4 in our party and ate on Saturday night. I didn't care for our table as it looked at the kitchen finishing area. Really nothing much to see and a lot of traffic. Additionally, the speaker was right over our heads and the music was way too loud and frankly the music could have been more mellow. The servers had to come around behind us to talk as nobody could hear each other very well. I had the 3 steak sampler for $135 which was excellently prepared. Also had Japanese blue fin tuna which was super. Everyone enjoyed their steaks. Side orders were very good but nothing great. Service was good but had to ask for water twice. They were all over filling our wine but not in an obnoxious way. The staff were very pleasant and not uppity

this restaurant is all about the stars. with a celebrity on the menu and the waiters with a craving to talk to "famous" people we went and had a fabulous time i think i was drunk before the main course. i remember having the bone marrow the food was excite and solo rich in flavour and texture. we went back to our hotel both feeling seedy and hubby regurgitated from the amount and richness of the food and myself feeling very ill. i guess it was with it thoâ€¦ lo
5
Our first visit to this restaurant and it didn't disappoint. The steak choice is wide, and of high quality, depending how much you wish to spend, and there are other alternatives, but realy this is a meat eater's restaurant. The wine list is quite pricey but plenty of choice. Thoroughly recommend
5
I am crazy for Wahyu Japanese beef. So when they have it in a fine restaurant like Wolfgang Puck, I will spend as many times I can. The mini burger for a start is very very good, and add the onion rings and glazed onions, that's the best combination. It's very rare steakhouse have a Japanese Wahyu beef, on top of the regular t-bone us steak. Their US beef also very good quality. Wine collection is superb too

We came for a nice steak and did not make a reservation. The waiter made a big deal about it but by exception was so nice to give us a table. He however mentioned that next time we really had to make a reservation and he was doing us a big favour (ha!). ALL tables around us remained empty during our dinner...Looking at the menu it is TERRIBLY over priced with the cheapest steaks starting at around 80 SGD up to 300-400. That excludes any sauces, extras, etc. Now in fact 80 SGD++ for an aged US stripling is not that bad. However it was pretty tasteless and there are many places in Singapore where you get a far better steak than this. I appreciate rents are high in Marina Bay Sands but then at least give a top quality steak. Positive is that the design of the restaurant is really classy, very nice furniture, good cutlery
5
everything is excellent from the appetiser until the main if you are not even a beef eater, you can go for their other main such as pork which is amazing and i love their mac n cheese.be prepare to pay for the $$, but they do have a excellent services as well.it will not dissapoint you

2nd time in The Cut (first one was in their Las Vegas Branch). Food was consistently amazing. Service was also excellent. A steak lover's haven.
4
The service is always Excellent at CUT.
Friendly staff always ready and anticipating your needs.
Consistently quality of Feed and super selection of American Wine..
5
if you want consistent cocktails, cut's the place. we have never been disappointed here so far. they make a kickass martini with the death door gin. pretty good selection of gin over there. service is always great too. we love this place!
5
What a great experience. Amazing food great meat and wines. An unforgettable evening. 8 people at a cost of SGD 3500 worth every cent. Thanks to the wonderful staff...
5
it's a great restaurant and the service is very good but its not outstanding, all in all it was a great dinner.
i hate the fact that it is in the middle of the mall, but this is singapore

Brought my partner to CUT for his birthday, hoping that it would be an amazing experience since CUT is regarded as one of the best steakhouses in Singapore. I made the reservation about 2 weeks in advance, asking for a quieter/ more private table and also informing them that my partner would be celebrating his birthday. The lady on the phone assured that my requests were noted down but when we arrived, we were given a table that was part of the common dining area. Upon seeing that there were booth seats available, we requested for one but the host replied that the booth seats were for VIPs only and that "we'll see how it goes." While waiting for our food a caucasian couple arrived and was shown to table next to us. Having seen their table, they asked the host for a booth seat, and the host similarly told them that the booths were unavailable. However, 10 minutes later when a booth freed up, the couple were moved to the booth. Our appetisers arrived before our cocktails even though we ordered the cocktails before the food. The server also dropped a slice of bread on the floor while serving us and did not pick it up after. When we were done with our mains it took 20 minutes before a server came to clear the table.In terms of food - We had the lump crab cakes which were alright, onion rings were delicious, bone marrow flan tasted quite terrible because it was way too milky. Ordered the USDA Prime ribeye and AUS bone-in ribeye. Both were pretty tasty and cooked well. Got 2 small scoops of ice cream and given only 1 spoon for the surprise birthday treat. Noticed that other couples celebrating occasions were given a pavlova tart. Not fussed but curious as to why it was different.Overall a very disappointing experience for a place I expected a lot more from. Will not return especially when celebrating a special occasion

We booked a table at CUT during the Grand Prix weekend in September after researching a good quality steakhouse .We were not disappointed .The service was excellent from start to finish . The food was of a very ,very high standard .We had for the main course ,the Japanese Kobe Wagyu beef fillet and this was up with the very best we have sampled ,taste, flavour ,cooked to perfection ,everything perfect .The desserts were also equally impressive ,well worth a try to finish the meal .Cut restaurant is not the cheapest, but if you want STEAK at its very best then this is the place to visit .Highly recommended if visiting Singapore ,especially the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes are
5
Dropped in by coincidence. Had scallops Hokkaido, an expensive rib eye steak and finally chocolate soufflÃ© (?). The food was exceptional. The service in the bar (where I was sitting), even better. Will return, despite the disastrous music (rock'n roll for people from small villages in US/Europe above 50). Expensive, but worth it

Make sure you arrive well before your reservation as your experience should begin with Rico and his crew at the bar. The making of your cocktail is a form of art for these gentlemen as they put both passion and love into every masterpiece they create. This is not a quick experience, but for the aficionado a wonderful and memorable experience. It amazes me that if you visit more than once, they will remember your favourite drink, which really impresses the ladies, and makes the customers feel extremely special. The menu provides an excellent selection of appetisers, steaks, and side dishes. Each bit is a wonderful explosion of flavours on the palate. Some of the steaks are very large, so make sure you understand what you are ordering. I usually begin my culinary experience with the Butter Lettuce, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette. This provides a wonderful tour of flavours getting me ready for the main course. For the sides, the Tempura Onion Rings provide a very different option, and usually a very nice presentation with the rings stacked on the plate. The wine list is very extensive, and they also provide half bottles for smaller dinning experiences. They will decant your bottle, which also adds to the wine experience. What really separates the Cut from other places is the service. The staff are all regulars, which provides a high level of consistency in service. They are more than just a team, but a family focused on ensuring you have a wonderful dinning experience

Cut is by far one of the better restaurant that I have been to till date. The ambience is fantastic, dark wood interior, low light condition and a very luxe feel to the whole place. There's a nice bar at the entrance of the restaurant which serves some of the best cocktail in town. (Though I have not tried them yet)The service was impeccable. Attention to all our needs and the servers and waiters were all very professional and helpful.The place is quite dim (old man like me with poor eyesight) and it was quite difficult to read the menu. The fonts are not big enough for me.The food was really good. The meat was really good too. The starters, the bread spread and the dessert were all above average.Unfortunately, the price was on the high side
5
Excellent diner, one of the best meats we ate in our life (Kobe beef, and US Wagyu beef), great wine list, fantastic waiters as well. Would definitely recommend the place, but be aware: it is very expensive.
4
I are at Cut while in Singapore on a business trip. The food was excellent quality and was delicious, although was quite steep in price. The staff were great- special thanks to my server Mary. Would recommend others to visit.
4
Excellent restaurant and the steaks were just as tender and tasty as you would expect at a restaurant like CUT, cooked to perfection, and did not disappoint! Loved the atmosphere and the service was great.
4
Gorgeous food but overpriced
Noisy restaurant with a strange way to book table service is not at the level we expect it
4
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore i must say.. The moment you step in to the moment you step out, simply an amazing experience every time. The staff are so attentive to your needs.. Food & Wine was spot on, ordered their Bone Marrow Flan as a starter and i must say, this dish went straight to my top 10 best dishes of my lifetime. Next was the Porterhouse & that was a big one, i recommend that to be shared among 3 or 4 people as it was huge but delish! That cream spinach that went with it, my lord that was so good! We had it among us two & we were so full we can't order dessert.. Wine selection over here is excellent as well, had a glass of white wine from Napa Valley & i must say, it was so good we finished up 2 bottles! A place you need to visit at least once & indulge.
4
We went to CUT on our last visit to Singapore, we had an amazing service and the staffs were really helpfull. We ordered the steak and even we usually didnt order our steak medium rare and we still think that the steak is absolutely tasty! The portion was huge and the steak was tender and juicy. However our side dish (cream spinach) is quite dissapointing and the salmon steak well is just average (i believe its part of our fault to order salmon in a restaurant thats famous for the beef) ;)  if you are looking for a great steak this is the right place for you to go but expect less on other dishes.The restaurant ambience personally is too dark... we can barely see the colour of our food and its also a bit noisy. Lets say we had an amazing steak but thats it...
5
We decided to fine at Cut for the last night of our honeymoon as a special treat. We informed the staff that this was our honeymoon and they looked after us incredibly well. We were given, in our opinion, the best table in the restaurant, a booth among the side, in the centre which meant we could see the whole restaurant. On arrival we were given complimentary Kobe sliders which were mouthwatering. We were then shown the different cuts of meat for the wagyu beef steaks, this was a great experience. Yes the food is expensive, but you know this before you arrive and we were happy to pay top prices for the best meat. So I selected the New York sirloin wagyu steak and my husband had the rib eye wagyu. We then asked for recommendations of sides and we were given honest suggestions telling us not to order too much which was nice! We also got complimentary bread rolls, I can describe how delicious they were but you'll see when you go! When. The food arrived it was amazing, so so good! We asked for recommendations of wine, we wanted red and our waitress suggested a wine for me and a different wine for my husband as we were ordering by the glass, we loved the selections. As a treat they gave us a complimentary dessert with a candle and it said congratulaions. And to top that off, when the bill arrived we were not charged for any of the wine! I would say that was a saving of S$140 which is approx Â£70 so we were very surprised and very grateful! We felt so looked after and loved the whole experience! We had the nicest waitress looking after us and she made our evening.

If you have spare change, this will be perfect for your appetite...their steak, especially the US ribeye is exceptionally generous at 395g, for a person like me who loves steak I found it a challenge to finish it. But I must tell you...the steak is fantastically good. Done to the perfection, I will go back to this place again. Well don
3
Look...the meat is great...Not the most ideal place to have such a prestigeous restaurant ( a shopping mall ) Service is attentive ...I know wine is expensive in Singapore...but this is really too much. I you are a couple. ..you have some pre dinner drinks... decent bottle of wine...decent cut of meat with the trimmings....some desert. You are not getting much change of S$ 1000 here ...Hmmmm if money is no object. Knock yourself out and go. If you are on a budget...this willd ent it
5
We just love the appetizers and starters! As we come quite regularly, we noticed that the service level will depend on which waiter/waitress you get - it ranges from perfunctory to genuinely warm. The problem is they seem to rotate their staff quite a bit. The steaks are good and keeps us coming back. However, the pricier steaks are not always better. After trying out the whole range from end to end, we have pretty much settled on the USDA prime - it's juicy, tender and always excellently prepared
4
Though a little bit on the pricey side, this place has a cozy ambience and the steaks portion is quite reasonable and cooked perfectly. Order the pork belly. It's the best u can find in town!
4
premise - its a cool place. abit dim but still nice decor. very posh nosh.location - MBSstaff - top service with politeness and all that jazz.... you'll feel right like a top dollarfood - a tad too salty if you ask me but still good. the starters and the sides were FANTASTIC! simply awesome! the mains are also good.crowd - mainly families and some couples. big group welcomedverdict - good to the bone meat and king like treatment. go and feel like a million bucks.... after having forked out 'a million bucks' :
4
Went there with my son and daughter for a special dinner and had made a phone booking from Australia 3 weeks in advance. The table that they gave us was by the Kitchen and unacceptable to me--I dont want a view of a kitchen when I am going out for dinner. They did move us eventually to a booth but not before some complaining! The food was very good and very expensive. We had drinks and bottle of wine and 3 course each not much change from SG$1,000. The waiters were excellent however the same cant be said about the western girl "front of house"
5
Steak meals will never ever be the same again for me now that I have to judge them by the standard experienced at Cut by Wolfgang Puck. Our Singapore-based son suggested Cut for one dinner outing while our teen-aged grandsons were in town. It's taken me a long time to relax when eating in places ranked so highly, and with rates to match, especially as this one was on us (my wife and I). However, I relaxed and enjoyed itThe six of us all had something different, and we were all very pleased with our choices. I had an Australian Angus which was tender and delicious. The sides were excellent also.The decor is subdued lighting with mirror tiles offset to give a broken-image effect.Service was prompt and attentive. We had a good Kiwi wine.It helps to know in advance that the place is expensive - steaks at $100 and up, up and up. Out of curiosity, I noticed the cheapest item on the menu was chicken at $45; don't be tempted when you can experience the best
5
Went there for our Anniversary after reading all the great reviews. Food was outstanding, service was warm and friendly - not pretentious. We asked for a nice romantic table and got one! Even though I only reserved the night before. Prices are high no doubt, but you won't be disappointed.Go
4
Firstly, the appetizers served were outstanding. The portion sizes were satisfying and everything served was simply delicious. However, when the steak arrived I was somewhat disappointed with its quality. I ordered the USDA prime rib eye and the American wagyu rib eye and it was quite a shock to me that I hardly tasted any fat in the meat. The steaks I ate were a little on the tough side and not very juicy, in fact there was hardly any juice from the meat at all.As a regular steak-eater, I am pretty familiar with the different steak grades and the type of marbling to expect when ordering a good piece of steak (which is why I was disappointed). However, this is still probably one of the better steak restaurants in Singapore, but it has the potential to be even better if they improve their steak quality/preparation. At the end of the day, even though I was disappointed with my main course, I have to give the restaurant credit for the outstanding appetizers and especially their tasty desserts which I have to say, gave the meal an excellent finish
4
From the Filet Mignon to the Sirloin, going through appetizer that were great..CUT is a great steak house with the good stuff to satisfy any cowboy :) only issue is the prices that are too high, no mentioning all the side dish that you have to pay for...The good wines French particularly are also expansive...So taste wise it's great, only problem is the check that is closer to the bill you would receive in 3* Michelin restaurant not in a Steak House even with a 1* if it's the case...I recommend the food the prefer to warn the customer
4
Got the 170g wagyu filet mignon and the 340g New York sirloin, both cooked to medium raw. The wagyu was perfect. Meat very tender. Is a must have. The sirloin was also delicious. The fatty part of the steak added moist and tenderness to the steak. My boyfriend loved the portion size. Great service and ambience. Cool interior decor with celebrity's photos on the wall (including Wolfgang himself). For dessert the baked Alaska is a must have! Had a fantastic time and would visit again
5
There is no doubt that the steaks here must be from quality meat. There were four of us and each one ordered a different type of steak and they were all beautifully cooked and tasted delicious. The staff were attentive without being intrusive. The prices are horrendously expensive, steaks start at approx £45-£125 plus tax and service. This doesn't include any sides or sauce, it was an extra £7 to get sauce and vegetables etc cost approx £12-14 per serving. Our hosts paid for the wine and I dread to think how much that cost. However if you are celebrating occasion this is a lovely place to go and has a great atmosphere also
5
I've eaten here twice already and each time I leave I am already thinking of the next excuse to return. It is not cheap but the service, the food and the whole experience just makes the money worth spending. One day, I will have tried every steak on the menu...and enjoying every bite! They are only open for dinner. I didn't make a reservation but it was very popular so I called in advance just to check that they had a table free. It was indeed almost full and I got a table only because it was nearly 9pm. Despite the time, the waiters were still as energetic as ever and so I didn't have to wait much at all for any service. The restaurant was a bit noisy but I guess that adds to the atmosphere if you like that sort of thing. But it was a very relaxed environment
5
I went to this restaurant with my family when we were visiting in November. The service was really good, even though we had no reservation, we did not have to wait for long and the food did not take long to come. It was Delicious!
5
We had a great dinner. Service was attentive. No overselling of pricier cuts as is usual in most steakhouses. Recommended. For non beef eaters, the iberico pork chop is very good too.
5
Four of us went here for a special night out and had the most wonderful evening. The service was excellent and the food was just amazing. Even the bread rolls were to die for. The sides were delicious and the steak (we had the cheapest on the menu!) was the best we have ever tasted. It just melted in the mouth. The whole meal was just perfection. Even the pouring of the red wine into a long funneled decanter was great to watch and the wine was equally delicious. It worked out about £100 per person but I would go back there in a heartbeat. Its the best eating experience we have ever had and we have eaten in a fair few places !
5
From the moment we walked in the service was impeccable. We had a cocktail at the bar and were entertained as our cocktails were prepared with expertise and care (I had the Samurai. Then we were taken to our table, one of the private booths off to the right. My husband went straight for the A5 Kobe beef but I was a bit undecided as I usually don't like fatty cuts of meat and coming from Australia I didn't want to have Australian beef. It was a great experience to have each of the cuts shown to us so we could see the marbling and I could chose what I wanted. I think I ended up going with the American Wagyu. We also ordered Maple Glazed Pork Belly and American Blue Crab entrees and the Broccolini, SunDried Tomatoes, Garlic, Chili and French Fries for sides and a bottle of red. Everything was simple, but cooked to perfection. This is the perfect example of chefs bringing the best out of the ingredients. The dessert was equally delicious and was brought out with "Happy Honeymoon" in chocolate written around the side of the plate - a thoughtful touch and fantastic finish to a great meal. It certainly was the most expensive steak we had even eaten but it was also the best - the price was worth it just to see the look on my husbands face as he ate his kobe beef. I cost us $900 for 2 entrees, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 2 cocktails, 1 dessert and a bottle of red wine. It was a great experience. I probably wouldn't say a steak restaurant is romantic but to make it a little special I would recommend booking a booth, and letting them know if it is a special occasion
5
Fantastic variety of steaks and high end meat and seafood meals. Service is what you should expect in a restaurant of this caliber. I see other complaining about the prices. All I can say is that it is a great, high-end steakhouse with superb products in Singapore. You get what you pay for in one of the most expensive cities in the works. Go to the outback if you want to pay less.
5
To start things off, we were greeted by very friendly staffs which have a thorough understanding of the menu and all food related questions. I had the American Wagyu rib-eye (230g) and it was a wonderful piece of meat. The meat was grilled to perfection with a hint of red in the middle. The beefy flavour was excellent. I had the Bone Marrow flan for starters and it was awesome. Try this if you have no idea which to choose. The Yukon Gold Potato puree which was one of the sides accompanying the steak was so smooth and tasty. Chocolate Soufflé was amazing. Be sure to make a reservation before going, as the place gets full every time
5
This is the 3rd time I'm here at CUT. This time I brought my guest from NZ. I made reservation online telling them about my 2 guest from NZ and wanted to let them try the best steak in SG! CUT never fails to impress me. Their staff are very attentive and the food are consistently good. Love their freshly baked bread, the starter bread sticks and the small little cheese balls bread. I can't eat a lot of meat, I always have the Fillet Mignon 170g which cost SGD 72. That steak already taste sooooo good, I can't imagine the taste of those 250++ steak.My NZ guest is a 86 yr old lady who has difficulty hearing, initially they put us on a table in between other tables which we requested for the corner table. The reception ladies were very quick to act and get the corner quiet table for us immediately. We were served by waiter Fabio who is very impressive and should be commended. Polite yet very professional, attentive and very proactive. All restaurant should have a Fabio. When I called for the bill, they brought out 2 small cakes with a candle for my 2 NZ guest! My guest are impress!Yes CUT is pricey, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal every time I'm there
4
Had the pre-theatre dinner. Good value, excellent service and very decent food.Although I opted for the wine pairing - which was most enjoyable at S$ 28 per person for two small glasses of wine - still the most expensive thing we had was the bottled water. When will restaurants just serve tap water - which is fine in Singapore - instead of forcing some supposed European spring water on you that ends up costing more than the meal?Otherwise a good experience
4
I'm always wary of expensive steakhouse chains, so when it was suggested we go to Cut, I wasn't expecting much apart from a large bill. Well I got the large bill but also had a thoroughly good experience. Not only were the steaks excellent, one of our group thought her fillet mignon the best she'd ever had, but perhaps the star of the show were the the starters. Two of our group had steak tartar, I had the asparagus and one had the stuffed bone marrow. All excellent and we were quickly encouraging each other to try our dishes.Likewise, the selection of wines by the glass was expensive, but excellent choices. One minor critcism; you get copious portions of fries and onion rings, good, but for this price, could be better, particularly the onion ring stack.If you're looking for an expensive steak house for clients or a celebration, Cut is better than many other options we've tried in Singapore
4
Steak was nice but as with all other comments over priced.the steaks were as nice as moo moos on the good coast or cha cha char in brisbane. The restaurant is located in the marina bay sands shopping centre which leads to a crowded type experience. Nice place to go if u miss a hearty stea
4
It was an attractive setting and the food was well prepared, but the prices are way above NY! You could be anywhere in the world and paying less.
5
Delicious food, wine & buzzing atmosphere. A definite must for steak lovers when in Singapore. Great for special occasions and get togethers with friends....... excellent service, nothing too much trouble.
5
We went there twice to eat the wagyu beef and we love it, even though quite pricey. We will go there again!
4
Great food, lovely booth table for 2, perfect service and pace of dinner, the best steak cooked to perfection and washed down with a very nice bottle of red. hard to fault, until the bill arrives!!
4
Truly the best steak I've ever had outside of New York City...but at these prices it ought to be. Relaxed vibe, relaxed service. Great wine list, but eye-poppingly overpriced. Suggest for a big expense account dinner, not sure I'd go back and pay on my own dime
4
I'll keep it brief and to the point:1) Had USDA Sirloin and Aus Angus Bone in Rib Eye. Both were cooked to our liking and tasted very good indeed. But, at a restaurant like this, that is the least you'd expect anyway.2) Staff were extremely polite and attentive. Lots of smiles, and clearly were highly professional in their service standards.3) Cost for steaks and side order, with a glass of wine and desserts was SGD330. Certainly no bargain, but we understood the level of dining this is. 4) Atmosphere and ambience, though, was extremely disappointing. We came, as a couple, for a birthday celebration and desired something a little quiet and romantic. However, the noise levels from parties of other guests and the constant mix of rock, pop and other music styles from the bar area, really made it uncomfortable, at times. You could tell a number of people were in for business meetings / meals, and others were just in for a good, happy time. I've no problem with that, but if you're looking for somewhere with a quiet, reserved and romantic atmosphere, then I'd say that this isn't the place.5) Free valet parking is available here, but be sure you ask Cut for the voucher to present to the parking guys when you return for your car.So, recommended for food, but give thought to the atmosphere you're seeking for your meal
5
Ok the negative undoubtedly is the cost. BUT the food and the in particular the steak was superb ... I had the A5 Wagyu fillet mignon and if you going to go here you should go for the best. At the end of the day it was worth it
3
Ok, so the food is good, the meat excellent but honestly, is it worth the price?? I suppose if you come from a country where meat like this is hard to find... But if you are Australian or American you will wonder why you didn't get up and leave
5
So last time i came last year i didn't enjoy my time and thought it was overrated. How does one year does make a difference. Coming with clients i figured go for it. The atmosphere is in a shopping mall which is fine with me because lots of other fine dining nearby.The food was terrific, and the meat was some of the juiciest i've ever had. And i'm a big steak lover somehow getting the opportunity to eat fine dining when i travel! Creamed spinich was a winner as were the brussel sprouts. This time i left feeling good about what i ate here.
4
We enjoyed excellent steak, great service and cozy ambience on our birthday dinner celebration. We thought the food was very good and well presented, however the steak wasn't that large for its price and claimed to serve 2 people. I could have eaten it myself easily. Being in the shopping center, the atmosphere isn't as plush as you would expect for this brand, but tables farther back are better than those closer to the mall entrance where we sat. There are other, more reasonably priced places for a steak in Singapore than here, but you do get great food. Value is questionable
5
We have been planning to visit Cut for awhile and finally decided to visit Cut for my birthday this year. Excellent atmosphere, great steak, polite waiting staff and heavenly dessert. Will be back.
5
Little to say on Cut, except go there have fun and enjoy fab food, service and soak up the atmosphere, don't be put off that the location is a shopping mall
5
Ok so it's in a shopping mall but once you enter inside, forget that bit as through the dark intimate lighting, you enter a different world! Welcome to Wolfgang's world of perfect steak...Cut!The food was excellent, the meat the best of cuts and the service timed to perfection. The taste is fairly unique, triple cooked steak at up at 500c does give it a special taste, or as my friends said simply "brilliant!"The highlight however was meeting the chef, who could not contain his enthusiasm for his creations and the impeccable kitchen.For the food 5 stars, the ambience and service 5 stars and as an experience 5 stars!!!
5
Lets get the negatives out of the way first. Its incredibly expensive, even for Singapore it is expensive. 3 of us, a drink each at the bar (1 beer and 2 G&Ts) no starters, 3 Sirloins with 5 sides, bottle of bottom range wine and some water? S$700+. That's a whole hill of money, and look at my other reviews, I am no stranger to expensive steak restaurants, and I am also not stranger to great steak restaurants, and I'd say Cut at MBS is the best steak I have ever had in a restaurant.It was simply sublime, we went for the Australian as it was aged for 45 days vs 21 days for USDA, and maybe this made the difference, but it was soft, easy to cut, hardly any fat (we asked for it medium and it was perfectly pink in the middle, Sirloin should always be medium as it is a fattier cut than Fillet...trust me), seriously it was amazing. And yes is was S$85, but they are big steaks, they must be actually bigger than their listed prices, and given the quality of the meat, were actually pretty good value.....GREAT value compared to £40 steaks in the UK....Sides? We ordered 2 bowls of fries (only 1 was needed between 3 of us), brussel sprouts (ace), creamed spinach topped with fried egg (lovely) and Broccolini (great), can also recommend the Armanac and Peppercorn sauce and the Bearnaise.They bring a little tray of mustards fo those who like their steak with a kick, and the pre meal bread sticks and bread choise is lovely, especially the onion bread.Service was as you expect, great.Was it the most expensive meal I have ever had at S$250 each (£125), probably not quite, but it is right up there. Was it the best steak meal I have ever had? Yes. Will I be back? Yes, every time I come to Singapore

We took a friend for dinner here and were treated to amazing service and the most wonderful food. Steaks were fabulously cooked to perfection. JB the chef sent over some amuse bouche and came to check in with us that everything was ok. I could not recommend this restaurant more. Everything was amazing from the moment we walked in. The cocktail list is also delightful, inventive and perfectly executed. I'm looking forward to our next trip to Singapore already

Was celebrating a good friends birthday. Started of with some yummy cocktails at the bar. The sliders and breadstick was a sneak peek of the goodness that was to follow ... Ordered a medium rare, fillet mignon which was simply divine. Had the cheesy spinach which was equally yummy and some mash. Ended off with some delicious dessert! We got to share the dessert thank goodness as I was afraid I would explode. Was a fantastic dining experience and look forward to going again

Awesome restaurant and service!From the moment we were seated to the time we walked out the staff were amazing!.Starting with the breadsticks, savouries and then the bread selection - superb! The steaks were cooked to perfection but the side of brussle sprouts were grilled and not what I expected. The dessert! Chocolate soufflé was great but a little dry but over all we had a fantastic meal

2nd time here, now alone.Only a place a the bar, as expected for a single traveller.....At least the Bar staff was really nice.Unfortunately the bread came after the starter and never got refilled although there was enough staff pacing the restaurant with loads of it...nevertheless the steak was delicious again as well as the dessert. They choose a proper glass here for your wine and have a very nice selection.If you want to be treated special as a single female traveller, keep searching....I am still searching for the place where you don't get underestimated, get a proper seat and table, get your bread on time, get it filled if empty and simply able to lean back and enjoy the evening..

I had a business dinner at Cut on a very busy Friday night. Enjoyed it: flawless execution of both food and service, and great experience overall. I would not say that it was my best meal ever, but the starters were very tasty, and my steak was just right: a very warm piece of prime beef served on a very hot plate, well seasoned and right flavor. Very decent wines by the glass. Staff worked very efficiently, and they managed to realize and then quickly correct a mistake that had been made (glass of wine was forgotten). Highly recommended
5
My husband and I love Cut! It is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore, and in our opinion, the best place for steak in Singapore.The decor is modern and super stylish, and service professional, knowledgeable and friendly. But the star here is really the meat. Dining here is not cheap, but you get a good menu with great variety, superb quality and excellent food. Everything we've eaten here is good, so come with a big appetite and order a full meal - appetisers, mains, desserts, wines.Great place for special occasions too
5
Without reservation we were served in the bar area - but it was great (and busy). The meat was perfect as usual, the supplements far too much - the American style. Excellent wines. High in price, but worth visiting.
5
Its my favourite. Yes it is. thanks for delivering always good food. and service. I will come back and back again
5
I was excited to eat here, but was blown away by the cocktails. Amazing cocktail menu and presentation.
Food wasn't too shabby either!
5
We went to Cut as a last hurrah to the end of our vacation and it was a superb experience. We didn't request for anything special and was pretty much prepared to be seated in an uncomfortable place but we were seated in a private dining alcove and instead of handing us the menu right away and leaving, the waiter stayed to chat with us. We thought we had tried the best beef/steak meal so far in to the vacation but they explained how their meat is truly different and that Cut is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that was given certification to serve Kobe beef. They let us took time to decide on the menu without being annoying, they gave better recommendations when we did decided on what we wanted to order and also suggested the wine pairings. The food doesn't need to be described because it's something that one should try to actually understand it, but we believe that being comfortable with service and ambiance of a restaurant takes a big part on why we had a great time dining in Cut

With high prices, come Great Expectations!And trust me when you look at this menu, you're going to be expecting a lot! But never fear, the kitchen here is always up to the task.If you're looking for a swanky joint to impress a date or you're simply looking for something special, the decor here is set to stun. It just reeks of quality. The interiors are impressively designed without being pretentious, with a play on warm brown hues and a mix of materials from brass to woods to stones. It's just a calming, classy joint that's obviously aimed at the trendy crowd.While the main event is obviously the succulent cuts of beef ranging from Australian Angus to Japanese Kobe and different Wagyus in between, the long list of appetisers refuses to be outshined.Try the blue swimmer crab, the tuna tartare, or the bone marrow. All are absolute stars in my book. Honestly, if you're not up to a heavy meal of chunks of meat, you could just order two or three starters and make an excellent dinner of it.Make sure you leave some room for dessert! The list here is so tempting I've often left the restaurant sad that I let myself go too far with the preceding courses.If there was one restaurant deserving of a Michelin star in Singapore, this would be the place
3
I guess it's the hype of a celebrity chef restaurant. But it was a bit of a let down. There are other better steak houses in Singapore. the steak was nicely cooked but that was it. A bit dry, no sauce or butter or salt or pepper or sidings. Hmmm, I guess you need to be a purist. It was just the steak alone on a white plate
4
I will definitely go back, and if we had ordered two mains we probably would have rated it a 5. Howeber we ordered the scallop carpaccio and the marrow apps. The scallops were a little acidic, the taste was a little bitter. And the marrow was creatively served, but it was like eating a flan. There was very little marrow essence.Wines and service were stellar. We will be back for sure. One of the best cuts of meat i have ever had
4
This place has seen me several times.... happy after a lucky night at casino, exhausted after shopping, early at night, late dinner, ...... never I had a problem. A lot of times I actually choose to sit at bar counter at entrance; alone.... and have dinner there. Bar staff is very well trained, and they could make any cocktail for you. Meat is a must...... this everybody knows. Supe
5
I have been to this place a few times now, Each time I have been the whole experience has been excellent, it consistently delivers good food good service and cocktails. I know it is a steak place but you must try the pork and dover sol
5
Fantastic food and excellent service levels. Very comprehensive wine list to suit all tastes. Atmosphere can be a little on the loud side with the cocktail bar just in front of some of the dining tables but this would definitely not stop us going here again the next time we are in Singapore. Highly recommend this restaurant
5
Ambiance, superb food and dining experience, outstanding service, knowledgable, friendly, courteous and obliging staff, and the cleanest bathroom! Wow factor it will be hard to find a match to the experience we had dining there we will be back!

I'll start this review by advising the reading public that this is an expensive restaurant. To give you an idea, my wife and I had 4 glasses of wine between the two of us, 1 appetizer to split, 2 steaks, 2 sides.....$427. The prices are not published on the internet but their USDA Ribeye is $98 (which is what I had), a glass of their Malbec is $26 and sides are $18. With that being said, both of us agreed that these were two of the best steaks we've ever had.The service was fantastic. We had a main waiter along with 2 others who were assisting him. there was no point during the entire dinner that I felt neglected. Every time we needed more wine or bread, they approached us and took care of what was required.The food, as I've mentioned, was fantastic. Steaks were perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and sides had good proportions and were very tasty. I've seen other reviews about the pretzel bread and how good it is.....I had 3 pieces, it was so delicious. Overall, if you're willing to spend some money, and you're looking for a great steak while in Singapore, do yourself a favor and shoot over to Cut and consume some of the best steak you'll have for a while. Reservations are recommended. I made them the day of, about 5 hours before dinner
5
We book a few days in advance, we snag a booth seat which is lovely for a couple. Staff provided excellent service, checking on everything. Menu had something for everyone, but the steak was our first priority and it did not disappoint. Yes it is not cheap, but you know that when you book, so we considered it value for money. Would certainly go again, next time in Singapore.
5
OK, to be honest, Cut is expensive. But at least you actually get what you pay for. Everything about Cut is exactly the way it should be. Expectations are not only always met, they are always exceeded. Unlike other steak houses in SG, Cut can be depended on each and every time to deliver exactly what is promised. I prefer the bone-in Ribeye, but other cuts have proven to be just as exemplary when I have ventured outside my usual order. The cocktails are incomparable, the steaks are heavenly, and the side dishes are better than could be reasonalby hoped for. The pretzel bread is a particularly tasty addition to the meal. Cut is made for those who appreciate the fine things in life, not for those looking for a bargain. Go with the correct mindset and a properly full wallet, and you will be assured of getting what you came for

im a lover of great steak and have eaten steaks from Europe to Australia and CUT in MSB is a great destination for dinner if you are visiting singapore.We made reservations on the day of dining on 2 separate occasions and the reception staff were fantastic! they remembered our names when we arrived for dinner and quickly ushered us to our table. The waiters were very informative and knowledgeable and there recommendations were very accurate , especially regarding the muscles as an entree. Very delicious !! the in house bread was also fantastic. we ordered the Australian rib eye topped with black truffles and altho is was slightly over cooked from medium rare , it was very tender and flavoursome. on the second occasion they forgot my black truffles... anyhow this was quickly amended.now regarding prices, you pay top dollar to eat hear once all the taxes and charges are included. both nights our bill came to $600 SD for 2 ppl!!! in short CUT is a great destination for steak, Great staff who go the extra mile to make sure you are catered for, just make sure you have a great relationship with your bank manager before goin
5
Following a full day of meetings I wandered to Cut without a reservation. Given the restaurant was fully booked I was happy to be accommodated at a table in the bar. Relaxed and fine by me.The full menu was available. I ordered the Australian Bone-in filet with fries and sprouts on the side. Steak was very tender and tasty - cooked perfectly medium rare. Sides were also both excellent.Staff friendly and efficient.Well worth a visi
3
We made a reservation at the door in 3 hours advance. Service was good. Foods quality(salads, breads, etc) were awesome in general. However, I think that it's overpriced and didn't get what I paid for. Steak quality was not the best steak out there. You can get better quality steak somewhere else with cheaper prices. I agree with people who say it's ripped off.And another drawback was the restaurant was so noisy. The atmosphere didn't really prepare for the dining expereince, I gotta say. We were group of 5 people and next to our table, 4 people sitting next to our table talking about all their personal issue were inevitably annoying. Keep some manner, people
4
the food was loavly. As a starter I had a tuna carpacio and main dish a baby chicken. Both were great. I took a sauvingnon blanc and it was no good, instead of opeing a new bottle they filld a new glaglass with the cork wine ... I informed the head waiter to instruct his staff. If i knew at that time it was a Puck restaurant i would have insisted before i left. The food has Miichllin quaility. I tasted the shimps too they were prepared perfect and the quality was so too
4
Exploring food in Singapore especially at Marina Bay Sands is just awesome. We visited Cut restaurant, and I must say it was an enjoyable evening. My starter the mussels is enough for 3 persons. It was fresh and to my liking. My main, I ordered a T-Bone steak, it was rather dry and chewy. I had cooked medium rare. Perhaps it wasn't the right meat to order because the rib-eye was out of this world. The service was attentive and what I liked most is the ambience. Overall great dining experience
5
We had the whole CUT experience, from drinks at the bar to dinner. Service was consistently excellent all throughout. We started with Rough Love (champagne, tanqueray, and plum wine) -- loved the drink and loved the small touches as well (big, crystal clear chunk of ice -- no quick dilution here, and perfectly positioned raspberry as a garnish). They also make a great Old Fashioned (with your choice of whiskey/bourbon). Dinner was also great. Loved the cheese puffs and parmesan breadsticks. They also had a great range of breads--the pretzel and the olive bread were particularly good that evening. For starters we had the bone marrow flan and the warm asparagus with poached egg, toast and bacon. Bone marrow flan was heavenly (deadly but heavenly!).We ordered the A5 Wagyu and the USDA ribeye, medium rare. They came out perfectly, and so flavorful you don't need the mustard or salt they serve with it. While the wagyu was great, i still prefer the wagyu at Fat Cow -- but the USDA definitely did not disappoint. Between the wayu and the ribeye, that evening's winner slab was definitely the ribeye. It was REALLY good. For sides we ordered the polenta (great! but you'd need to eat it fast as it gets clumpy and cakey as it gets cold) and the butternut squash with chestnuts. My only regret is that we ordered too much and couldn't finish everything (much as we would have liked to). If i could do it over again i would have just ordered one side and swapped the Wagyu for another USDA ribeye :) Service was really great -- for the service alone the premium paid was worth it. Attentive without being too intrusive, very friendly and sincere, quick to respond. We ordered a bottle of wine and they decanted it first to let it breathe, before pouring it into the glasses and serving them. We ordered everything to share, and they thoughfully served out individual portions. I had a big bag with me and without being asked they immediately procured a bag hanger. Our table was a bit small and without being asked they added an extension to make room. To top it off, they surprised us with dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary then. It was a great evening, and I would definitely come back. Kudos to the team at CUT that evening (January 14, 2014) -- we really had a great time

Not even withstanding the extremely high prices (dinner for 4 was over S$1000 without expensive wine), the steaks we had were neither very flavorful nor with nice texture... In fact, one was tough as a shoe..
5
Can't argue with the quality of steaks here - they are of the best category but the entire experience lacks something. It could be the seating, the seemingly desire of the wait staff to rush you through (so they could turn the tables fast enough?) or maybe I was using Morton's as the "standard"? I would go again, Wolfgang Puck's name is a big draw and you can't go wrong entertaining your VIPs there, but for an intimate steak meal with family, Cut would still be my second choice. No prizes for guessing what my first choice will be
4
Cut is a great experience. The interior decor is nice, dark and moody like a steakhouse should be. The booths are upholstered in a leather several shades too light and you can therefore see many red wine stains, besides that the fit out is great. Walking to the bathroom takes you through a perspex floor to ceiling cellar which is quite impressive. Make sure you check it out. The food in this restaurant is definitely good. The bone marrow was cooked to perfection and exceeded expectations. The ox tail soup was more of a beef consomme, whilst great, it wasn't amazing. The Australian porterhouse for sharing is a massive serving. I ordered it to experience how well they cook a steak with a bone through it. Both the fillet side and sirloin side were cooked well and whilst didn't have a high level of marbling were a good steak. The cocktails at this restaurant are extremely good, in fact much better than the rooftop bar at Marina bay sands. Do yourself a favour and have at least one cocktail here.The wine list here is extensive and expensive. You can spend $150 on a bottle of red or $40,000. There are maybe 3 or 4 options below the $150 mark. Alternatively the wine by the glass is good also.In summary you will get a very good meal here, you will definitely pay a premium for it though. I think it is 30% more than you would pay in similar restaurants elsewhere.I almost forgot to mention the 1980's soundtrack playing throughout the evening. Who doesn't like a good 1980's soundtrack

CUT by Wolfgang Puck in Singapore is part of Puck's global empire and yet the restaurant achieves a singularity not common to such large businesses. Located in the shopping plaza of Marina Bay Sands, it still manages to feel like a cool private club.The interior design is stylish and hip, and the staff are all young and good-looking, yet warmly friendly to a diverse mix of customers. The bar is small (just 6 or 8 seats) but will serve dinner for those who prefer to avoid the greater formality of the dining room. The dining room is mid-size with low ambient lighting. It's a good date night spot.Steaks are the restaurant's raisin d'etre, of course, though there are other menu options. Still, why go to a superior steakhouse and not enjoy it? The steak frites was perfect: a fairly small filet (probably 6 oz), it's not a "hungry-man" dish but the taste is more than satisfying and the cut tender and perfectly, lightly marbled. It's served with a selection of sauces (bernaise, homemade steak sauce and ketchup) as well as an offering of mustards from delicate to spicy. The frites are seasoned with herbs and just irresistible. The desserts are indulgent with regard to combinations and flavors, but just small enough to eliminate any guilt.The drama and entertainment at the bar is provided by the bartenders. Their complex mix of bitters and flavors, all concocted into a dizzying array of specialty cocktails, are prepared in a light-hearted and almost balletic handling of shakers and pourers. Watching them was a delight! Very easy to recommend. Though not inexpensive, it's worth the cost
5
What could a world famous Chef do with something as straight forward as a steak. Well it was amazing. Well worth the price and the Japanese Wagu was worth every dollar. The ambiance was amazing as was the wine. Don't forget to order the onion rings..
5
So you have sot start with cocktails at the bar, this is the right place for getting the atmosphere. theres a good selection and the boys will knock up literally anything else…we had to many… The you get into the restaurant, its well lit, lively, buzzing and really is a great place with a good feel. The staff are all trained, they go through the usual menu of items and process control - but they have a personality, can articulate and engaging. Then there is the wine list - can be a bit pricy, but search through and you'll find a bargain - i choose a barolo for $130 or so - that club street prices. the grand finale of course if the food and if your in the mood for steak, this is it. I went for the $80 striploin and it was perfect… All in all CUT covered all the bases very well, good staff, good atmosphere, great food, good wine
5
I was invited to dinner here last week. I had not known the place before and therefore considered it to "probably" be good, as is the case with Singapore fine dining. It is immediately beside the famous landmark hotel. in the mall. We had the mini burgers as appetizers and what an appetizer! For the main course I enjoyed a Fillet steak as a mail with a very small addition of creamed potatoes and roasted vegetables. The "sides" would not be for the ravenous but to be fair the meal was very balanced and very filling. The desserts are superb and all washed down with a very acceptable wine selection. THe restaurant is spacious and well laid out; however finding the route to the restrooms could be challenging...one has to wind ones way through several large glass fronted wine cabinets! The staff are very friendly and efficient and the ambience is in keeping with such fine establishments in Singapore. To be fair I was a business guest, however I believe the prices are not for a cheap night! Again, if you want a cheap night why go fine dining? Great place, would return without hesitation and wholeheartedly recommended
4
Steak was great. Service was superb. Drinks were gd. Had a wide range of drinks. Ambience was good too, though I'd say it's a bit on the dark side. Abit difficult if u want to snap pictures. But all in all, we r there to eat, so yes, definitely recommended
4
Andrew and I booked via email from Australia before our holiday. Lovely cocktails in the bar before dinner.We shared an entree of pork belly and it was lovely. We both ordered steak for our mains and they were really good. I've had better. Dessert was good too. Cocktails were really nice and the service was good. Only thing that was totally wrong was paying $18 for a bottle of water!! Of course you say yes to water not thinking you would be paying for it. Outrageous. Great restaurant, good staff, been there, no need to go back.
4
Cut has amazing steaks as you'd expect -- all the food was really very good. Portions were generous. I didn't give the restaurant a 5 rating because I found much of the food to be salty and dessert wasn't fantastic (we ordered a chocolate souffle). However, our steaks were delicious and worth the price. Service was excellent. Great bar - which we've been to several times
5
When I asked which sauces best went well with my meat, I was advised that the best meat did not need sauce or seasoning! It was true at Cut! :)
5
One of our favorite restaurant and we are there at least twice a month. We usually order our favorite starter, American blue crab and shrimp "louis" which is always a delight. My wife and I dine at CUT specially for this dish.After many visits and trying almost every steak item on the menu, we now stick with the Australian Angus, dry aged New York Sirloin. The 340 grams serving is huge and we always asks to be shared between my wife and myself. We prefer to have light dinners and at CUT, it is very nice of them to provide serving separate half portions for the steak and starters as well, especially if we are game for desserts.The Mini Wagyu Burgers are wonderful bites and are served at the bar. The meat is tasty and juicy. They almost melt in your mouth. Being a regular I guess, they are served complimentary at our table.Some of our favorite sides are the "wild mushrooms", creamy spinach with fried egg, Mac and cheese and potato purée. We usually order only one side for each meal. The bread are freshly baked and they offer unlimited helpings with a selection of 4 different types. This is another reason why half portions servings are sufficient. It takes a lot of will power to stop eating the bread and save space for the starters and mains. Besides steaks, we have tried the baby chicken which is absolutely tasty and delicious. You can ask for sharing portion if you like to have a light dinners. We tried the Maine lobster and we both were not impressed with this dish personally.We are always happy with the service and I remember even on our first visits, we experienced the same level of service which has remain consistent over the year and half since we started patronizing CUT. We are not wine drinkers and always asks for normal drinking water. Our meals cost are usually in the S$150 to S$200 range for the 2 of us. We used to spend more than S$300 for each visit but that was before we started having light dinners for health and weight reasons. Having half portions serving means we still can enjoy eating at CUT and save for our next visit

Went for the first time with group of colleagues looking for a fun night out. We had the best steaks which were a tad expensive for what we got. The 1kg slab of Australian wagyu for sharing was better than the Kobe beef specials. The wine list was excellent as we're the breads and sauces. The choice of starters was exquisite. The only letdown were the chips on the side which were very Ho hum ordinary. They made a very expensive meal look cheap and positively failed to make the cut. So if you like your steak with chips, this may not be the place for you.The service and ambience were as expected. We stayed till closing time mainly because the wine went down very well and the music was great. We were still talking about it the next day. This place has to be tried at least once
5
Went here almost by accident. We were looking for somewhere to eat, and literally walked by the door. We ate in the bar - we both had steak and chips. This meal was absolutely fabulous! Probably our best meal while in Singapore. Why? The meat was delicious and cooked perfectly. The service was second to none. The price was fair.We were only sorry that we didn't get back there again before the end of our trip
3
First the food - yes, the steaks are good but unfortunately for Cut, this is an expected criteria. Nothing short of the best quality steaks would be expected especially given the price that you are paying for it. This is not a value for money place - it is on the higher end but I must say that the entire meal was faultless in terms of food quality. From the breads at the beginning of the meal, right down to dessert - all of it was good. We took the tasting platter and it was of good quality, not overwhelmed by sauces (it is all on the side), and perfectly done. The tasting platter is recommended especially for those who may want to try the wagyu and kobe beef but may find the full slab too much for them.Sadly though, the service and ambience is lacking. Nothing poor about the service but nothing to shout about either. We found the waiters rather patronising and cold. Very much doing their jobs by the book, without any real passion. Information about the menu is read out as if they memorised a text book and some times perhaps in a rather condescending tone. The ambience - this may be a personal preference so it is rather subjective. This is not a quiet, fine dining establishment. It has loud music, almost like a bar - creating a rather noisy, unsettling environment. The decor i find doesn't quite go with trying to portray a fine dining establishment but sure, this is subjective taste. It is almost as if the place is trying too hard to please and everything clashes from the music to the mirrors, to the portraits on the wall and it all comes to a terrible mix of loudness. We do have other good steakhouses in Singapore and some which offer a much better overall experience and not just focused on the food itself
3
Having arrived absolutely parched after attending the closing of the Singapore Fashion week, we were seated at a table to the front and side of this buzzing restaurant. I am an vegetarian so am unable to comment on the quality of the "cuts" at this establishment but having no such self imposed dietary restrictions when it comes to enjoy a tipple or two I feel the need to share my thoughts on the quality of the drinks and, the spicy popcorn, warm bread and service of the staff.The drinks menu is varied and as one can expect pricey. I ordered a gin concoction with orange blossom and cucumber slices and my friends, something called Rough Love which had a raspberry miraculously fused atop of cube of ice that never melts! Go figure. It was truly delectable. The popcorn was overtly spiced and the fact that they did not serve us water whilst we waited 30 minutes for our drinks, really did not help matters. The bread they brought as a snack for us was lovely and warm and helped line our stomachs which was quiet necessary given the power of the drinks. Service levels for an establishment that portrays itself as top notch were so so and nothing I would write home about. So if like me you are a thirsty vegetarian and like your gins, then go and have a drink. These are quiet good but like me you may come away with being somewhat satisfied
5
As a westerner in Singapore on business for around 6 months, Asian cuisine certainly became tiresome after a while.Cut was by far the best steak I had in singapore. The sides were also faultless, we had truffle fries, macaroni cheese and onion rings.Service was top, exactly as you'd expect when paying those sort of prices.The total bill came to around S$400 but that was for a couple of cocktails each, 4 sides, fillet steaks and 2 desserts. Definitely the place to go for something high end, a special occasion or a little different
4
I had a two-course dinner here, starting with the exciting veal tongue. It was a bit daunting to imagine the taste of tongue, but it was recommended by the very polite waitor (they were all super polite!) and I was grateful for that because it really was quite something else.For the mains I ordered the Australian Angus sirloin medium rare, and I gotta say it is the best steak I've ever had. The crust was seasoned and charred perfectly (never had one done like this before), and the meat together with a little bit of the fat really created a little explosion of rich beefy fatty charred flavor in your mouth! The size of my steak was 350gm I think, quite a decent portion for $80.The cheese sticks and assorted bread rolls for appetizer were great too, especially the German roll. Also had a glass of Pinot noir to complement the steak, beautiful!Total for two persons came up to be $430. Will come back again, but as the price is quite steep it would have to be for a special occasion
5
The restaurant is in a mall but it should not be underestimated. The steak was perfect. The price was ridiculous though! We were stumped trying to find a wine below $200. I expected expensive and normally just swallow it, but this place got the best of me. For the first time in years I actually held back on what I ordered. The night before at Ku De Ta it was over $200 per person but this place is in a mall
5
Cut is absolutely my FAVORITE restaurant in Singapore! The service is constantly great and the food is consistently superb! Where to start?? I can't begin to name my favorite dish as I love them all!!! The Bone Marrow Flan, Steak Tar Tar, Hokkaido Scallop “Carpaccio”, Creamed Spinach with Fried Egg and the Warm Asparagus, Poached Egg with Warm Bacon Vinaigrette have got to be in my top five all time favorites! My kids go nuts over the mac n cheese and sliders. The chocolate souffle is to die for! The drinks! OMG!!! Hands down, Cut has the BEST cocktails in Singapore! My favorite is Help Save The Bees but I would like to try them all!!! Also, the atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxing without being stuffy or uptight, yet at the same time classy! Excellent choice of music! If you're looking for a dining experience that will stay with you for months as a truly satisfying gastronomical event, then I suggest you try Cut. You will not be disappointed
4
One of the best steaks I've had in Singapore. The service was impeccable and the staff were extremely attentive but not intrusive. You almost forget that you are in a shopping mall ... Well almost.
4
A bit overpriced, by the time you had all the extras, fries, onion rings and béarnaise sauce. A good bottle of red he cost so be prepared to spend here. Good steaks, US grain beef was full of flavour. Spot on service.
4
Do not go if you need to count the pennies.
If not a stylish time out, great service and attention to detail

The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 3 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, The Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes

The food is scrumptious. Service is very attentive and non-pushy (for some reason, waiters at top steak restaurants tend to be 'forceful', both in Singapore and the US). The portions are huge (almost American style) - especially for appetizers and side dishes, leaving customers less room to appreciate the steaks. The only drawback is that a restaurant of this caliber is located in the middle of a huge shopping mall; not even in a quiet corner/separate floor like the 'celebrity restaurants'
5
Title says it all. Steaks were delicious, starters great, salads lovely and the dessert (the rhubarb crumble) gloriously yum. Restaurant located inside the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex and personally I would have preferred a nicer setting than the mall and the casual bar-style entrance, but I cannot fault the food. I found the random posters of moviestars on the wall a bit confusing though - not sure what that was about! To give you an estimate Steaks are around $150-200 per person (unless you split one, which, given their size and your level of hunger you can easily do). Starters and desserts start at around $27-30. Side dishes like mashed potato are around $14-16 each. Wine would set you back extra. Would go again for sure but it would have to be for a special occasion. Reservations necessary
4
A friend recommended this restaurant and I went along thinking it would be ok, but not terrific. I ate the best steak I have tasted anywhere. The quality of the meat was amazing and the preparation was really good. Interesting broad choice of beers from all over the world. The staff were friendly and efficient. Why not 5 stars? at the end of the day you are sitting in a restaurant in a large mall and the ambience / environment was missing something. Also a sense of the American focus on turning tables. So, felt a little bit rushed. Food was the best though
4
We decided to visit Cut. The service was impeccable. The staff were quite attentive in explaining on what is being served and were quite good in checking in on the drinks. The steak was a big portion and can be shared with another person. Nice ambience but it can get a little noisy if the restaurant is crowded. The chocolate souffle is light to taste, just remember to leave the ice cream and cream on the sides - it taste even better that way. Met Mr Alex Resnik, one of the partner of Wolfgang. A lovely man who obviously knows his job and is good at it as well. It was a lovely dining experience. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place to bring his business associates

complemented by excellent service - some of the best burger and steak sandwich possible - with very well cultivated beers (with some rare gems - even bavarian microbreweries) and a great bartender.. would have liked to dine there but no time left - must come back - stunning wine cellarOnly downside might be perhaps the dark interior which can make feel claustrophobic - no viewsBurgers 9/10steak sandwich 8/10prices to match....service outstandin

For pics and an in depth review, please visit my blog at: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/2013/7/18/sunday-funday-part-uno-cutCut is hands down, one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Their steak, specifically the Kobe, just melts in your mouth, whilst the sides are (almost) as delectable. My husband and I ordered the fries, wild mushrooms and spinach which were all great (my fave was probably the fries though! Potatoes are the best veg!). We went on our anniversary and spent over $1,000 but must say it was incredibly worth it! The service is impeccable, and the waiters go above and beyond to serve you. The ambience is also lovely, with a dark, trendy interior. Now everyone knows Cut for its mouth watering slabs of beef, but what many may not know is that their cocktails are equally as divine. To read more about Cut's lesser known bar, please go to my blog above

Not so fussed about the location with some tables exposed to a shopping arcade. Nonetheless this is no doubt the best steak I have ever eaten. Rather expensive but worthy of a treat or special occasion.
5
Started with some un-manly cocktails at the bar, recovered my manhood with a 1kg ribeye steak with bone. Possibly one of the best steaks I've had and cooked to perfection.
5
I am a steak lover and have sampled steaks from all over the world. I had the good fortune of sampling Kobe beef in Japan and I must say it remains one of my all time favourites.I also like tenderloin (aka filet mignon) and I must say Cut serves the best filet mignon in the world. No other restaurants come close. Period.If you are steak lover, look no further
5
Excellent food, excellent service. Probably worth the price, and that is saying something. I don't eat steak, but tried their pork chop. It was mouth watering. The same goes for the side items. All of them. The rest got steaks, and seemed to love it. Also, we had one minor complaint that night that we made the server aware of, and for that we got immediate apologies and a free bottle of ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape right away. I was speechless. This is my second time to Cut and I will definitely be back
4
I have enjoyed good steak in a number or cities and this would be up there with one of the best steaks I have had. The service and atmosphere was great. The meal was exactly as ordered including the cooking of the steaks. Wine list was quite good and reasonably priced considering the location and city. The meals were on the high side of pricing but for the area they were on par. It was not a cheap place to eat but for a special occasion it is quite nice
3
Ah, the famous CUT. The prices were really very 'cut' as well. The steaks were overall quite good, but a good 20% more expensive than say Bedrock Bar & grill, which had comparable if not better steak. The starter breads selection were surprisingly what wow-ed me. Good ambience, good food, but not exactly worth the price. Service was also average, which shouldn't be the case if I'm paying $100 for my steak. Check out the more detailed rant at:http://sethlui.com/food-review-cut-wolfgang-puck

Cut in singapore have some off the best cuts of meet i ever tried. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff very good. For starter we had the bone marrow and it was nice. I had the AUS ribeye whit bone, it was cook just like i ordered MR. The only thing is the price is high, I will come back when i saved up some more money :
5
I had a family diner here for my mum's birthday. Food was delicious as I expected and love friendly staff. Only thing is it was a bit too loud as tables are too close to each other. Otherwise I would say Cut is one of the best steak house in Singapore.
2
Restaurant and staff seems to take It for granted that they can continue to charge an exorbitant amount of money for steak and a nice collection of Martin Schuller s pictures on the wall. Be careful because Singapore likes value. There is no value there anymore,but a lot of slack, and poor execution
5
Our first visit to this restaurant and it didn't disappoint. The cocktail selection is eclectic and extensive and the barmen friendly and chatty and offer ecoomendations, so it is great to have a pre dinner drink at the bar.The steak choice is wide, and of high quality, depending how much you wish to spend, and there are other alternatives, but reaaly this is a meat eater's restaurant. We had the "prawn cocktail" and crab cakes for starters, and these were fantastic, wasabi pannacotta with the prawn cocktail with a difference was delicious. The wine list is quite pricey but plenty of choice. This resataurant is in the relatively expensive bracket but one of the best meals I have had recently and the atmosphere is really nice if you have the alcove seating which is a bit more private. Thoroughly recommend
5
This restaurant is definitely worth a meal. Service is quick and attentive. Menu options are extensive. Food is excellent.
5
Cut is simply fabulous! Their cocktails is a must! Staff is friendly and attentive and so is management. Definitely worth the visit!
5
Not much i can say expect that this is a great restaurant! Good food, good service, strong drinks! A great restaurant in any city. I especially loved the onion rings and porterhouse stake.
3
I'm not a fan of restaurants in malls in general, so that bias probably affects my rating. My expectations were also very high to begin with. And I have to say that the food was excellent - BUT! the music was so loud and the acoustics so bad that there was a constant clanging, echoing din so that you have to raise your voice to speak. The a/c is so cold I sat with my arms wrapped around myself. The angled mirrors create a jarring visual effect - the whole experience was a bit of an assault on the senses. The steaks were perfectly cooked, however all the meat is waygu-style which is too fatty for my taste. And the price - exorbitant
2
Finishing culinary school not long ago, decided to start trying restaurant food again. I went to CUT by Wolfgang Puck for one of many "meat tasting" experiences.Decor is awesome. But i expect it from such a place. I ordered a Porterhouse medium rare to share with a friend, but i wasn't too impressed to be honest. I'm sure they got it from a quality meat supplier, but i felt that it was cooked too long. Maybe i'm being too hard or maybe it was on the grill too long. Side dishes and dessert weren't bad. Onion rings are awesome as advertised.. But i shelled top dollar for this meal.. and i just didn't feel satisfied. Not to mention i couldn't get waitstaff attention. I mean, this is CUT! and its more expensive than Mortons! i'm going to come back again. But honestly, i'd choose Mortons or the up and comer "Bistecca" Tuscan steakhouse if i'm going to have to shell out top dollar for a great steak
1
Had dinner to celebrate a birthday dinner. Things went fine till the end when the restaurant served its complimentary dessert. Wife consumed a part of the dish which was not meant to be eaten, and it was not clear at all that some parts of the dessert were only for presentation purposes. The consumed bits coloured my wife's mouth green and it remained so despite several washes, so, imagine our dismay.The crew was terrible. When we spoke to the team, they, including the manager, were not at all apologetic and were patronising in their response. At one point, commenting "But this is complimentary"....well, that doesn't mean you have the right to serve us something inedible.Very pathetic service level for a restaurant of such stature.....This place can't hold a candle to Morton's. And definitely not value for money. People, do yourself a service and spend your money somewhere else
5
This is the place to go for steaks; None in our group tried anything else. An excellent meal and good service, as it should be in this price bracket. But well worth it for a memorable meal. Had a disappointing Cut experience in London the previous month so was apprehensive but this was much better. The portions are large; could easily feed two and most did not clear their plate but ther was nothing on the evening that went wrong and all worth the price
4
Three of us went to dinner there . The service was wonderful . Two of us ordered the Salmon . Major disappointment ....... We found bone in our Salmon . Never expected in a restaurant like CUT. One should go for steak only . The rest of the food was pretty good .The decor , the atmosphere was very pleasant 
4
After moving around SEA for a few weeks I was ready for some US food.What a find! Must be one of the best places for a steak in Singapore. Cut by Wolfgang Puck, in a spectacular building, did the job.First class quality food and service at a fair price for what was on offer. OK it's very different from Spago in L.A. But still the top class signature of Wolfgang Puck.Recommended
3
I got the porter house to share with my boy friend and honestly, I found it was quite tough and chewy. I had been waiting to go to Cut for months, so I was a little disappointed with the tenderness of the steak. I've gone to Morton's several times, and their steaks have always left my feeling satisfied. However, it has to be said that Cut has a wonderful ambience and a great cocktails list, though those drinks come at quite a high price. I would only make Cut a special occasion place, and maybe try another cut of meat next time. (Another thing to note is that your not allowed to bring your own birthday cakes
4
... Unfortunately the occasional rough and troublemaker guest is still welcomed at the bar. Some local bald regular decided to upset everyone at the bar with his behavior. Otherwise its the best cocktail bar in Sing .
5
This place has great service, awesome meat and yummy side items. Best meal I have had in Singapore so far.
5
A wonderful enchanted resturant with welcoming friendly and accomodating staff. This is an understated, chic and trendy resturant. I was taken as a surprise, we sat in a booth. Looking at the menu I was spolit for choice with an exellent choice of dishes, the crab starter and tuna tartare were the best thing ive tasted in a long time, the Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef steak was out of this world. I savoured every last taste. The sides were really tatsy too, even though the dishes were standard to most resturants the presentation was exellent and they added their own twist on things, the onion rings were lovely! The wine menu gives a great selection. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed not snooty at all despite the different range of people there. Smart dress is required. We had a fantastic meal here and will be going back without fail! Although make sure you dont eat all day so you can really enjoy your meal
5
My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday. We're both steak lovers, and I do believe I'd found one of the best places to enjoy a good steak in Singapore. The filet mignon I had was grilled to perfection. What's more, the pastry chef agreed to make a one-off strawberry cake (6-inch, as I remember) that my boyfriend requested but was not on the menu. It came with a 'Happy Birthday' written on the plate together with my name. The best part was that it came at no extra charges for the special efforts, which really impressed us. I loved the view of the restaurant interior from our booth table as well
5
My wife and I love tasting food from around the world. Though The Cut is very standard American cuisine, there was nothing standard about the taste, selection, venue and service. This was probably one of the best meals that the two of us have had.(a) Steaks were perfectly cooked and tasted great (b) Wine selection was endless (c) Service was good (d) and it might seem a bit childish, but the various breads that they continuously brought around were like no other... awesome "pretzel" bread!Will definitely go back
3
FWIW, I'm biased against the outlets at Marina Bay Sands. "Shoppes" says it all for me.The restaurant is very dimly lit, seating is quite tightly packed, and acoustics are noisy. You have to raise your voice to be heard. Service is speedy and efficient.Gougeres and parmesan breadsticks were ok. I've had better bread and butter at less exalted places. Steaks arrived a degree more done than expected. Steaks were perfectly cooked at their level of (over-)doneness, and the side-dishes were tasty and very well-done. The outside of my steak was very tasty, a prime example of Maillard reactions, but the inside was curiously unexciting given that it was dry-aged for 45 days.Dessert was good.Big winelist with big markups, enough to make you teetotal if you are not being comped.Conclusion - big prices and big reputation spoiled by layout and patchy food execution.Service and Food are "Good", 3.5 spots, but I'm biased

If you are going to spend top dollar on a special dinner at what is purported to be a top of the line restaurants, this is not the place. It took us 2 requests and 40 minutes to get a pre-dinner drink and there were only 8 people in the restaurant at the time. Before going to the dining area we sat in the lounge for a drink, across from a person seated at the bar who was engaged in chatting with some of the staff. This turned out to be the manager. There was no greeting or acknowledgment that we were even there.Once service started, we were flooded with inane service, interrupted in conversation and otherwise pestered by "attentive and obliging" staff. While the food was OK, not great but on the OK side of good, the service bothered so much that we decided to complain to the manager. Turned out to be the same gent from the bar. We stated our case and learned that he was transferring out in two weeks and really wasn't concerned about what we had to say.Singapore is getting a bad rap about a variety of things these days and I'm sure they don't need a negative restaurant review, but seriously this is the type of service you might expect at a diner, with the food being marginally better. There are better options in Singapore for a great steak
5
My husband and I went here almost a year ago and I'm still raving over our experience. We've been to several restaurants of this caliber in Vegas (one being another Wolfgang Puck restaurant) but this meal has stuck out in my mind more than the others. Though it could be because of the amount alcohol consumed in Vegas. The sommelier was very helpful and charming. They kept bring around free bread inbetween the courses and we almost filled up on it though we had already ordered entrees, steaks and dessert. All the breads were soooooo good. Some had small amounts of cheese inside. The pretzel bread was particularly spectacular . We are going back in a few weeks and I'm hoping my husband wants to go back
5
I'm always a bit skeptical about non-Asian food in Singapore. Too often, there's a slightly wrong note injected that reminds you of an Asian dish. In short, Cut made me forget about those concerns.The meat (and I tried a bite of several different cuts) was all fantastic. I had a New York Sirloin that was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was juicy, flavorful, and succulent. The side items were all very good as well. Hell, even the bread was outstanding. Cut isn't cheap, but this was the best meal I have had in Singapore. And, if you're paying these prices it had better be. Cut is an excellent choice for any special occasion

Cut by name, cut by nature, this place is a cut above rest. What a fantastic restaurant, we were looking to find somewhere special for our last night in Singapore, and looked through the celebrity restaurants list at Marina Bay Sands. Cut came up as a suggestion, especially since it’s a Wolfgang Puck owned restaurant. From the moment we entered the restaurant the service was excellent, being early they seated us at the bar and offered drinks while they prepared a table. We ended up with a superb booth in the front corner. The menu is a real meat lover’s heaven with top quality meats from around the world, including Japan, Australia and USA and various grades and styles. After choosing a 400g New York steak and was extremely delighted with the absolute quality of the food and especially the chefs cooking, which was to perfection. All courses were great, especially the deserts and we could not have asked for better food. The wine list is also very extensive with a vast variety of wines from throughout the world. We bought by the glass so we could taste a few different varieties and nationalities. The decor in the restaurant was also tastefully done and of a very high quality, from its subtle lighting, to its glass cellars on several walls and a range of celebrity portraits on the walls, very intimate. However with all these great attributes, the best part of the restaurant was the staff, the service was exceptional. The staff were very attentive from the moment we walked into the restaurant till the last moment before we left. We were never waiting or wanting for more service and the service of every course was magnificent, with several staff bringing over the food and describing each course, sauces and condiments in detail, and personally serving the sides. While they kept a respectable distance between services so we could have privacy they constantly monitors us and when they came over showed genuine interest in us and made conversation . One of the best I have ever been to, and we have been to some of the best
4
Steak and lobster to die for, excellent service, wine a little pricey, but that's Singapore. No need for entree meals are huge, sides are very generous also.
5
What can I say. Great quality, amazing interior, fantastic service. All you ever wish for! The best place for the best gastronomy experience!
5
My boyfriend and I went to Cut for my Pre-bday celebration! The food presentation was fabulous and it was really perfect! You can't ask for more. Compare the whole experience, food ambience this is by far better than Morton's! We will definitely be back
5
Started with knock-your-socks off cocktails: Earl Grey Martini and the Pins and Needles. Wow. Tuna tartar dripped in flavor and the sides and mains were world-class stuffs: mac n cheese, field mushrooms, blue cheese salad, and the USDA rib eye. Best steak ever. We matched it all with a perfect cab but elected not to drop the 40,000 bucks for a '92 Screaming Eagle. The only thing screaming was the bill, but it's Singapore and it was completely worth it. The food and service were some of the best we've ever had. Very cool atmosphere too. An updated traditional steak house: leathers and woods and candles, but done in this era. Very neat.
3
I just came back from Asia and being from NYC, i gotta have good steak. I tried 2 steakhouses in Singapore. CUT was one of them. Now, the steak was really good, almost like the other steakhouse i visited.. But it was really expensive, and like the last review, it wasn't special enough for the cost. It was dark inside, and yes there was a bar.. But it felt pretentious.. I don't know but its not a laid back place.. The steak was really nice and juicy and was really good.. Other than that the other dishes weren't bad but nothing to write home about again.. I'd visit CUT if its on the company dime, but if on my own dime, i'd choose another place.. .
4
My wife and I are fans of Puck so this was an easy choice for dinner on our recent visit. The restaurantn is accessedb off an shopping mall so there is no sense of arrival, Couple this with the near darkness inside and it is a little off putting.Anyway, our waiter was pleasant and we ordered in good time. Unfortunately, they had a large function and all the attendees gathered around the rear of our table to have there pre-dinner drinks. Very very noisy 30 minutes.The food was good, my veal chop was superb. Service continued to be of a high standard.The bill was around £100 per head so it's not a cheap evening.All in all it was an Ok night but nothing to write home about. There are more interesting places to eat -- see my report on 'Stellar at Altitude'
5
My husband and I decided to splurge and have our last meal of our honeymoon at CUT. We are so glad we did as it was an amazing experience. The staff were so professional, well presented, well spoken, knowledgable and treated us as valued customers. Our entrees were amazing, our steaks were cooked to perfection. My husband loves steak and was extremely impressed with the cut and how it was cooked. We could not fit desert in, but our waitress brought us ice cream with a sparkler and congratulations written on the plate as it was our honeymoon. This was a beautiful touch. All in all we are so pleased we decided to dine here and we will never forget our experience, I'm afraid no steak is going to compare after dining at Cut. So thank you for a fantastic experience.
5
Went to Cut while on a visit back to Singapore. There was a chef fundraising event here to benefit Food for the Heart. There were 5 of the nation's best chef's participating including Cut's own Executive Chef, Joshua Brown. We had a 5 course meal with wines paired with each. Everything was simply amazing, from the staff to dessert and the ambiance. I can't wait to go back to Cut on my next trip to Singapore! Keep up the good work Chef Brown
4
In terms of ambience, this is an impressive joint. Seated at a booth, it's almost theatre like watching the other diners and the staff going about with their business. The waiters came across polished and smooth. The steaks were impressive and cooked to the way you like them. Sides were delicious, especially the creamed spinach and sautéed mushrooms. Overall, very good experience although pricey. Got to be for special occasions for most of us average people
5
This review is slightly overdue. Went there sometime back with my wife and my 2 month old daughter to celebrate my birthday. I must say I started off rather annoyed that they would not let me leave my sleeping daughter in the stroller (which had to be brought to the back). Apart from that, a complete uphill dining experience.They have these little cheesy breaded thingy that they serve before the meal. If not for fear of looking like a cheapskate I would have been happy to sit there and order them the entire night. The menu provided an excellent variety of steaks with quality corresponding directly to price. In this place, you get exactly what you pay for. If you want volume, go for the potterhouse, if you want an excellent cow, take the most expensive wagyu you can find on the menu. My wife made the wiser choice and ordered a platter that allowed her to sample 3 different grades of steaks. I swear you won't realise how much different a cow can taste until you've tried that platter- I was blown away. Service was acceptable good though I have experienced better for the pricing. If you are planning to visit CUT, know that you will not be dissapointed by the product if you are prepared to spend correspondingly . 2nd best steak experience I've had worldwide (and i eat alot of cow)
2
The food and service is decently good but service inconsistent. Some of the staff were genuinely warm but some were a bit ignorant. We felt maybe because we did not order much expensive wine! Food is actually good but at the price it loses its value. In my view only those fine dining French, Japanese, Italian restaurant where the food presentation is so elaborate deserve this kind of pricing. Good to try once in a long while or just once but I won't go back again to empty my wallet for just a steak. Expect to spend $400-$600 for 2 meals
4
Great service, very good food, expect to pay $6-800 sgd for two. Including a glass of wine. Nice ambience, water - is an exorbitant price. Ordered the wagyu - they had choices from Aus, Jpn. Lobster, bone marrow etc. Look at the pictures I posted. Worth it if you want to splurge. Reserve, if you want to dine here
5
From the moment you walk in you know its gonna cost you a fair bit of money to eat at CUT. They have an impressive whiskey display at the bar and an even more impressive wine room. Cocktails took just a wee bit more time than we expected but it gave us time to enjoy some popcorns that they gave us whilst waiting for our table. As we were walked into the restaurant, it seemed darker than night but as soon as our eyes began to acclimatise to the flickering candles and dim lights we began to appreciate the atmosphere. Classic rock numbers were played and you could almost swear you're in the 80s somewhere in Hollywood. The service did not disappoint either. Fabio (if we got his name right) led us through our dining experience with presentations and an unusual wine service not to mention an almost theatrical way ofDesqcribing the different things on the menu. In the end it was as if he was planning our entire dinner for the evening as we chose all his recommendations. His team was also as efficient and unobtrusive.The food was simply awesome; Crab and Shrimp Louis, Marrow Flan for apps. Snake River Farms Filet Mignon and USDA prime Rib with sides of Fabio's magic mushrooms and Fingerling Potatoes with bacon. We had an Argentinian Malbec to go with our steaks and desserts had to be the choc souffle.We were so full after desserts that we knew we had to go walk in the massive MBS area to get abit of digestion going.Great AmbienceGreat Waitersand more importantly Great Food. Bar none
5
Our family was out to watch a show at MBS and decided to stop at CUT by Wolfgang Puck to grab some dinner. The service was incredible, with the waiters being dedicated to give us the full service package, from start to end. The choice of bread was ample and they even took the courtesy to show us some of the prime cuts of beef. My wife ordered the Petit Mignon and my son and I ordered the 720g Porterhouse Steak to share. Both courses were incredible and is among some of the best steak that I've had in some time. The only downside is that the restaurant is quite dark, which provides great atmosphere, but not so great for families with young children. Other than this small downside, absolute great steak! Highly recommend it 
5
Writing superlatives will not do justice to the experience, the food and service. As illustration: The floor manager was extremely embarrassed and apologized profusely at a small faux-pas that happened next to our table, nothing to do at our setting, but it was seen as inappropriate to happen at The Cut! If you go there on a special occasion, do not go with a budget. Enjoy it to the fullest. You will not regret the splurge
5
I went to cut on a Thursday night without reservation and we were asked if we had a reservation. the restaurant was packed. They proposed us alternative time and leave our number in case there is a table that was available earlier to the schedule proposed.After 30 minutes, they contacted us and it was all good. The service and maitre d'hotel were very helpful. The service was so smooth that you even dont have to look for a waiter that there is already one service staff to care of your request. We had steak one of the best for me in Asia. Wine selection is really good and the wine service was perfect.Price wise its normal for singapore but you get the value for money from the service, quality of the product and location.I strongly recommend to book your table to really enjoyed the experience
5
How lucky am I, my husband decided that we dine at CUT for our wedding anniversary :) It was a weekday evening- Monday to be precise and it was almost full at about 8pm. The atmosphere was relax and not so stiff. There were many staffs around and the gentleman who attended to our table on the cosy booth,was very attentive.Hubby chose the Prime Sirloin “Steak Tartare”, Herb Aioli, Mustard and Hokkaido Scallop “Carpaccio,” Shaved Myoga, Wasabi-Kosho Ponzu for our starters. Both were very good. The best I ever had, though I am not a fan of scallops. It was perfection!As for mains, hubby wanted to get the Australian Wagyu / Angus, 400+ Days Grain Fed, BMS 8+, From Stockyard, Queensland -Bone in Rib Eye Steak (For Two) 900g but I thought looking at the weight it is too much for us. Hence, we ordered Rib Eye Steak 395g and Bone In Filet Mignon 380g with house made steak sauce and fries. Believe it or not, we were literally behaving like carnivores! though it was meant to be a "romantic" evening :) Accompanied with a nice bottle of red wine from Tuscany, we enjoyed indulging in our own comfort. We will be back! Hubby is a steak fan and CUT is his favorite so far on the list, beating Morton's and Ruth's. Thumbs up,Puck
5
Incredible night! You will pay dearly - our meal for four was just over $1000 for generous ordering of both food and alcohol, with gratuity, but it was really worth the splurge. My boyfriend and I split a Kobe steak and lobster to create our own surf and turf and it was delectible. Service was great - extemely personable and warm without being stuffy. There were plenty of celebrities around, but without any annoying fanfare. Wolfgang Puck's higher end restaurants have proven to be consistently amazing. Highly recommend
5
My wife, our friend and I had dinner at Cut. We ordered one starter to share - crap and lobster, which was nice, though with too much mayonnaise. For main course, we had the American steak (filet mignon and rib eye cuts), which is the cheapest option on the steak menu - it was very tender and cooked to perfection and as ordered, though pricy. We had a Californian Cabernet red wine, which was very good - though expensive compared to the US, but, reasonable value for Singapore. The service is a bit above standard for Singapore (which generally is very low). Very nice decor. Quality completely the same as Cut in Las Vegas. Will for sure come back
5
Fantastic as always. The steaks are pricey, but sensational - and being able to view the different cuts of meat prior to selecting your meal is a good touch. Food was well cooked, and there was a good selection of sides. The only negative was that my colleague tried to order some rum, and the selection was a little bit limited. However, the whisky selection was broad enough to satisfy

Meat was probably best quality I have ever had but super expensive. Cheapest steak was eighty bucks!
5
Personally, I love the steaks there! If it wasn't so costly, I would definitely visit them more often! I proposed there as well! So yep, sweet memories, great food & great service!

Dined here recently with a friend. We deliberately wanted an earlier meal and the place was a bit quiet when we arrived (6:30pm). By the time we left the place had filled and the vibe was excellent. We tried the tasting plate of three types of meat (Japanese, Australian and USA) and they were all delicious. The plate came with three types of sauces all of which were great accompliments to the meat. We ordered a side of fries and onion rings to go with our steaks and could not make a respectable dent in either of them there was so much. I canot comment on the desserts and we could not even attempt. Staff were efficient and knew the menu well. The fit out was very chic and made you feel welcome rather than being in a showroom. There were families, couples, business people and solo diners which reflects it appeal. Having said all of this you do certainly have to pay higher than average for this "total package"
5
The Cut is pricey, there is no doubt about that! Yet we still end up sitting and eating at the bar 2-3 every month. The food is great and the atmosphere at the bar is fun. The bartenders, whom we know by name, often are tasked to come up with a new drink for us and they always deliver. Great US steaks and lamb chops

Located in the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, the Cut by Wolfgang Puck is a great place for a celebration. This is classy dining and you can get real quality steaks as well as lobsters.Operated by a celebrity chef and open only for dinner, this is a high end restaurant which serves quality food. If you are having a celebration and prepared to be a little extravagant, this is a wonderful place where the service matches the price. :

My husband, son, his wife and I had dinner at Cut in Marina Bay Sands last night. We had oysters for starters, steak for the main and a great dessert. We thought that we had a great meal.This morning , my husband , son and daughter-in-law had stomach upsets ,only I did not have one, as I did not have the oysters. My son is still throwing up and is quite ill. For a restaurant such as CUT, this is totally unacceptable
5
Cut is the kind of restaurant that upon entering you feel you are in for something special. Dark, glossy, masculine and adorned byt large photographs of the film and music celebrities that Wolfgang Puck has cooked for - Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, Helen Mirren, Pink and more. Not the kind of assorted snaps that you might see in long established restaurants. But gallery quality portraits, that also feature on the back of the menus. So that's the optics. Service is abundant and attentive - quite at odds with the general dining out experience in Singapore. Sometimes is borders on a little intrusive, especially when you are trying to converse with your dining companions. Bread is fresh-baked and delightful. Served twice ahead of the entree, then breadplates are cleared. Entrees are chef-y and generously sized. They range from about $25-$40 (yes that's correct). Now to the steaks - which is the lifeline of this restaurant. They range in age and country of origin - Australia, Japan and USA primarily. The starting price (of just the steak, no sides) is about $90. The most expensive of the steaks is around $250. Sauces are $5 (seems mean not to include the sauce in the price I feel), additions (ie mushrooms, fried egg) and sides (vegetables, polenta, artichokes, chips etc) range from $15 - $22. Water is $18. Deserts are $18. Pricing aside for a moment - the quality of this meal is unparallelled. The steaks are supreme. Cooked perfectly as ordered and very large (rib eye and sirloin each from the cheap end of the menu!). The completion/assembly of some dishes is done at the table - the entree marrow dumpling soup and the valrhona chocolate souffle were examples of this).Often you can pay very large amounts for a chic dining experience and walk await with a half-full belly. At Cut you are guaranteed to be delighted by the food quality and presentation as well as full to bursting if you do a three course meal. And for ours (with just one glass of wine - also from the lower end of the wine list) our three course meal for two people was just shy of $500 SGD. Yes..$250 a head roughly excluding alcohol. So best to head to this restaurant knowing full well you are in for an outstanding dinner and a nose-bleedingly expensive bill at the end of it, especially if you are getting into the wines which I expect could then push the bill nearer to $300-$400 per person! But it doesn't seem to have deterred the punters - on a Wednesday night it was fully booked.Anyway, despite the cost (and I was prepared for this before I went) I have to say I believe this is without doubt THE best dining experience I have had in Singapore and possible THE best steak I have had anywhere
4
Cut is a classy restaurant, it exudes a warm and inviting atmosphere, the waiting staff is well versed and presented. The food quality is at the expected level but was surprised to see the cost of the dishes, 3 course a la carte for 2 people exceeded $350 SGD and also got charged for still water (ie. $18 for a bottle of voss water). I would expect water to be complimentary as at most other surrounding restaurants, the markup on the food should be more than adequate to cover for water for the guests..
4
The restaurant it is very elegant and classy, the atmosphere was beautiful and very well-designed, the glass cases of bottles of wine provided a nice backdrop.â€¨The steaks were perfectly cooked, tender and succulentService here is excellent, professional without being to intrusiveAll in all, I very much enjoyed cu

When I planned my holiday to Singapore last December, I wanted to visit a special steak restaurant. Having searched in the internet, I found CUT to be a good place to try.I made reservation through email few days ahead, and they confirmed my reservation almost instantly.Very friendly and professional service, the waiter explained the food in good details.For appetizer, I ordered American Blue Crab & Shrimp "Louis", Spicy Tomato Horseradish.The crab and shrimp are very fresh and juicy, it blends very perfectly with the rich flavour from the sauce.For the main course, I ordered their specialty, 100% Wagyu Beef From Shiga Prefecture, specifically the Rib Eye Steak. The steak is extraordinarily tender and succulent. Four types of sauces are provided to accompany the steak.Of course, all the foods came to be very pricey, but it's the place where price never lies.It's a really wonderful dining experience
5
Service staff was great, friendly. Food, though expensive, was worth the money spent. Great for special occasions. You pay for the brand and the celebrity. This is a once in a while splurging.
Make reservations. It is necessary.
5
Fabulous wonderful superb The food is astonishingly good without exception, however the rack of lamb is the finest that our table had ever tasted. A memory to cherishThe steaks were sublime, chicken so good it cannot be described and the lobster perfect.Very good wine list if rather overpriced. Superb and discreet service rarely found in Singapore these days and all are to be creditedPerfect ambience spoiled by the music being a little loud causing all tables to get louder and louder to be heard turn it down 5 dba and it would be perfectThis is not a cheap snack as previous reviewers have said but if you like good food ensure you try it you should not be disappointedand will not need to stop for a snack on way home
3
Wish I had taken another reviewers recommendation and had the chocolate souffle at the bar and nothing else. For us, the steaks were excellent, one of the best ever. It was however the rest of the experience that let us down. While our individual service was very good - nice explanation of the menu, wine presentation, pacing, etc. - the 'frantic' service around us was distracting. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant which wasn't perhaps the best location. We found the large staff rushing to and fro off putting and combined with the horrible background music (more noise really) and hard surfaces everywhere, made for a not very relaxing experience. Admittedly I put a lot of emphasis on the overall ambience and experience but when we dine out and spent considerable money, I look forward to more than just great food
5
This is my number 1 steakhouse. Globally. Seriously. Perfect steaks, like the Wagyu-Idaho Angus crossbreed, Kobe style. Great starters, bread, wine selection, and the service is unreal in its quality (this IS Singapore after all, hard to believe). And then there is the Valrhona Chocolate soufflé. I suggest you come here for it separately without having anything else. Just sit at the bar, eat the soufflé, drink a glass of de Bortoli Noble One and enjoy life.
5
Being from the USA, I was fairly confident that I had tried the best beef in the world in Texas. I found out I was wrong, their Kobe beef is so awesome, it has changed how I think of steak forever more. Probably the best meal I have ever had, with the best service I've ever had. We had a drink at the bar before being seated and had one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I will always remember the evening spent at Cut.... It was that good. Only bad thing is that it is very, very, very expensive.
5
Everything is impressive in this bar / restaurant from the design to the glasses and even the ice cubes served. We only had cocktails but what cocktails. Service was really professional and the quality of the drinks served was impressive. I shall go back ASAP, so far my favorite bar in Singapore
4
Very good steakhouse with big selection of the finest cuts of beef+nice interior with atmosphere. As a starter we ordered :prawn coctail and blue crab with shrimps-Yami ! as a main course we eate two diferent kind of Angus beef- both were soft crispy and delicate. It is difficult to describe how delicious it was. Must try
5
I,ve been a fan of wolfgang puck since I first went to his Californian restaurant in the 90's.I should have thought about it ...the name gives it away ..CUT is a steakhouse predominantly .The interior is very smart and we were in a room lined with wine and mirrors...all very chic.A sensational wine list. A very sopificated starters menu ( as I was expecting or hoping)Then the steak. Perhaps the best steak I have ever eaten.. remarkable..Worth making a trip to Singapore just for the steak.Oh and the staff are first rate.
5
Having been so let down by cut London see my other reviews, I was worried that it would be the same as London, well what a surprise , service 11 out of 10, they were great, food 11 out of 10 steaks cooked correct , portion size good, not pre cut steaks but cut as I requested , the taste of the bone in fillet was as good as gibbons in Chicago , a truly excellent meal, with great service , great red wine and some wonderful cocktails. From the London being the worst meal of 2012 cut Singapore is in the top five for 2012 well done to all who severed meal and the chef cooked the steaks, top mark
5
Strange to go to a shopping centre for an impeccable meal!Felt a little over dressed as this really is right slap bang in the middle of the mall!!!The food is amazing, best steak my party has ever had, pork chops are a mini joint and so big!!!Belly port starter just perfect as was prawn cocktailNo room for desert but choice goodIs a little costly for the location and wine choice pricey but do go
5
Short and sweet, was the best steak i have ever eaten, was amazing. Service was excellent.. just fantastic. Expensive but if you want to experience steak at its peak this is definately how you do it.
2
For starters - Blue fin tuna tartare (was ok but preferred the taste to be lighter to highlight the freshness of the fish) and maple glazed pork belly (too sweet and greasy). Most of us ordered steaks and were certainly let down by what we got – one of our steaks was delivered almost cold (didn’t they, at the very least, placed it at the food warmer??). The other steak was burnt and charred in the outside, and was more towards medium rare instead of the order for medium. It certainly was a shame because the meat was good, but it was let down by such carelessness in the kitchen. The lamb chops was close to tasteless and there was nothing spectacular at all. Side dishes – potatoes with bacon was way too greasy and the creamed spinach was very average (the egg on the spinach made it way too creamy and gooey.We would have expected for the staff to be more attentive. On several occasions, it certainly took some effort to get their attention. One of us had been to the Las Vegas restaurant, and took the view that the service here was nowhere close to what she had experienced there! The person who took our order seemed very hurried and hassled. He left without even asking for our order for wine, despite the wine list being in front of me. The meal costs us close to S$300 per person (inclusive an “inexpensive” bottle of wine). This is not supposed to be an ordinary steak joint. It has Wolfgang’s name in it and it is not unreasonable to have higher than normal expectations. But leaving that aside, I’m still trying to see some positives to an otherwise unmemorable experience. BTW, you don’t actually need to spend this much for a great steak – and choices are many here in Singapore
5
Dinner at CUT was impeccably great! Great cocktails, best service, fabulous dishes; I had Bone marrow flan, filet mingon and chocolate soufflé. It's unbelievably good. Only that it's do expensive. I will go back for more cocktails for sure but foodwise, I would probably go once a quarter if not bi-annually
4
My husband and I shared the steak tasting. It was delicious and a great, innovative concept. They cooked it to perfection, a true medium rare - nice and red! I learned I liked Wagu the best. The sides we ordered perfectly complimented the steak, the potatoes and mushrooms. The wine presentation was really nice; they have an extensive wine menu with a vertical vintage of screaming eagle. The least expensive wine on the menu runs about $100; the mark up is huge. Be prepared to pay a few hundred for dinner per person.
5
We always compare CUT with Prime Le Meridien in KL. Always by all dimension, CUT outperformed prime. Service was pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu and wines and price much cheaper than Prime. Steaks were tastier and juicer than Prime, even at a lower grade beef/marble
4
I've been here four times and every time the food has been absolutely incredible. The blue fin tuna tartare is awesome as is the burrata. I favour the USDA rib-eye and it never fails to deliver on perfect flavour and doneness. I've experienced both excellent and average service. If you know you're going to be paying S$300+ per head then the worst way to start the evening is with unsatisfactory service. If I clearly and succinctly order a very dry martini with Martin Miller gin and olives, I don't expect the next 2 questions to be whether I have any preference for the brand of gin and if I want olives, and then have to send the cocktail back because it's drowned in vermouth. It's very amateurish and not in the Wolfgang Puck style. Pet peeve aside, the quality of the food makes up for it. I'll be back again and again
5
Great meal. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had and although pricey it seems to be on a par with top Singapore restaurant prices. Not sure about having to walk through the shopping mall to get there. Once inside though you forgot about being in the mall
5
I frequented Mozza and DB Bistro but somehow avoided the steak house across because I've never had a good slab of steak here in Singapore... until I ventured into Cut. We started with the appetizer of bone marrow flan, it was creamy and flavorful and please do share it. No one should eat this entire dish alone. We also shared the steak tartare which was also fantastic but the serving was good for two. So two appetizers for two pax was too much. We ordered the US Wagyu Ribeye and the seasoning, texture, and doneness were perfect. I was blown away. I tried the different sauces they provided which were good but I prefer it without any sauces. We thought of ordering a side dish but wanted to save space for dessert.For dessert, we shared the souffle and it was the perfect exclamation point to a delicious dinner
5
Read the raving reviews but never believed that it could be that good. My husband made a reservation for dinner on a Wednesday night to celebrate our anniversary and was informed that only an early sitting was available (6.30pm). We arrived on time and the place was already quite bustling. Service was good from the moment we arrived as was the amuse bouche, cheese sticks and wonderful breads. I ordered the Blue Crab appetizer and my husband the Oxtail Boullion with dumplings. I haven't had anything as fresh and satisfying as that appetizer for the longest time and at $36 it was expensive but worth every penny. We shared a NY tasting platter which has 3 types of steak - NY steak, Kobe & Japanese Wagyu and they kindly apportioned it into 2 plates for us. It came with 3 different types of sauces and we were told which sauce went with which steak. Loved the wagyu and NY steak. Kobe for me was also good. They were all small cust (about 180g) but that was good as it enabled us to enjoy every mouthful without feeling stuffed beyond words (as is usually the case with most steakhouses). It also enabled us to at least share a dessert - a bombe alaska which came with a lighted candle and happy anniversary penned in chocolate on the plate as they had asked & my husband had told them that we were having a celebration. Service was good from beginning to end and although it probably isn't a place you could come often (although you would wish to) as the bill was more than $300 per head - its well worth the splurge. When we left just after 9 it was full which clearly shows that alot of people feel the same
4
I just had a full dinner at Cut just last week and it was an awesome experience. I went there for a birthday celebration and had a party of 6. The place itself was well decorated (although the, as usual, the lighting's really dim) and the service was quite good. We ordered the Scallop and Blue Crab appetizers, individual steaks and Mac & Cheese and Broccolini sides. For me, I ordered the USDA Prime Ribeye Cut Steak. For the appetizers, I would high recommend the Scallop. The Scallop Carpaccio with Ponzu Sauce is excellent as the Scallops were very fresh and perfectly cut. The Ponzu sauce gives it a very fresh and tangy outlook that goes perfectly with the Scallops. The Blue Crab is pretty meaty and tasty, so start with the scallop first before moving on to something more heavy like the Blue Crab "Louis"As for the steak, my Ribeye was excellent. The meat is tender, juicy and the marbling of the fats was done very well. The temperature was just right too. On top of that, the meat is grilled on hardwood and charcoal, giving it a nice "woody" and "charred" taste. This gives it extra flavor and taste, making the high quality steak here even better. Just a small warning though: The Ribeye here has A LOT of fats (which is the way I like it), so if you are health conscious or just don't like the heavenly taste of fats, stay away from the ribeye and go for either the sirloin or the fillet mignon (the leanness part of the meat). I had a bite off the other people's Australian Wagyu RIbeye and the meat is so much better (though the price is much higher). The dessert is just as good as the main course.Overall it was an excellent meal but that comes with the high price. Some may think that no food is worth that amount but I believe that this meal is more of a gastronomical experience (complete with ambience and service) that is worth the occasional splurge. A last word of advice: To fully enjoy your meat, it'll be good to read out on the difference of the different cuts available (or you can count on the staff) , in order to know exactly what your preferences are.

I ordered the tasting on the menu. My husband, MIL and Auntie ordered different. The only one that I really like was the most expensive on the menu. The rest i couldnt bite well. Dress formal.
4
High expectations which were met easily! I loved the fact that they brought the butchers trolley to your table and explained each cut, it was a talking point and you could see the quality before you ordered. Wine list was impressive but expensive. The service was outstanding, non pretentious and every bit 5 star! Down side not a lot to choose from if you dont want red meat, but you are dining at Cut, so what do you expect, however it would have been nice to see some more feminine styled/ sized dishes.
5
Smart casual, so it says in the resto's website and they take it seriously. As soon as we arrived without a reservation, we were asked how many we were. When we said 3 with my son still not around, the lady in the reception cautioned, no shorts allowed.In its website I had read the main dining area would close at 10 and lucky for us we were there at 930 pm. Beyond 10 one could order from the bar and lounge entrees merely.The cheese biscuits and cheese sticks laid before us shortly after we ordered were oh so good! Second orders of the same are no longer free but we couldn't resist the grougeres!A selection of breads was offered thereafter. First round we got the onion focaccia followed by the German pretzel for the second round. As promised the pretzel was not at all tough inside! Great tasting bread served with butter for waiting out our orders.The Porterhouse steak which the menu indicated to be 990 grams and good for two was huge. Some two inches thick it looked charred on the outside but was reddish and tender on the inside. It was apportioned equally between husband and me and I groaned inwardly as five big portions were put on my plate, same for husband. A lot of meat remained around the bone on the wooden tray were the steak had been sliced. Sauces that came with the steak by default were a bearnaise one and a steak sauce. Tiny cups with a variety of mustards and salt were similarly put before us. For the sidings we ordered the corn with onions etc. Son ordered a fish dish that was deboned sans its head before him. It had a lemon sauce, I think.Overall the food was good, great even! Cut was an experience we will never forget.Prior to going, I read reviews on the resto - not favorable ones with regard to the food and the service. These made me hesitate to go, but I'm glad we went. We had no complaints at all about the food and service. Everyone was pleasant and eager to be of service
5
We had a business cocktail party at Cut and was quite impressed. The finger food was very good but even better was the service. The ratio of waiters per guest was impressive and they all work diligently with a smile on. The actual restaurant and the room we had was very elegant and well appointed. I was surprised to find this quality within a shopping mall, but this is not just any shopping mall, but the Marina Bay Sands mall, so quality is everywhere (at a price
5
We went to the Restaurant for a birthday dinner with a group of friends. The atmosphere was great, the service the best I've experienced in Singapore so far! Our booking was during Happy Hour and we had some delicious cocktails. The food was awesome, very pricey but overall worth it.
4
Arriving at Singapore after a longer trip to Indonesia I really missed a good piece of beef. As we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands we took the opportunity for a steak dinner at cut. After a bad experience in a Puck restaurant in LA I was interested what we would be served.As we did not have a dinner reservation we have been offered a table in the bar, which was fine with us. The deco and the style of the place is very nice and the service first hand. After ordering cocktails we went trough the menus which offers the best cut's you can find. So we finally decided on:Starter: Bone marrow flan and the American blue crab and shrimp.Main: Fillet mignon and rib eye with wild mushrooms and broccoli on the side.The food has been excellent and the steaks have been grilled to perfection. There is also a good selection of beers and wine by the glass.This meal has made up well for my bad experience in LA and I would go there any time again
5
We stopped off here after a day of shopping and were so glad we did. Not only is the cocktail list genius, the staff are passionate and deticated to their craft.We sat at the bar with friends of ours and the cocktail waiter was very engaging and answered any questions we had. We had a great chat while sipping on our amazing drinks.Would return for sure
4
Dinner with a friend, nice ambiance, still very full for a Tuesday night. Starters of Lobster and a pretty basic Butter Lettuce salad with blue cheese. Very good, but at SGD 29, the salad certainly was no bargain. The US Fillet Minion was excellent, 180 gram at SGD +170 also not really cheap (plus sides). Desert of lime-pie and ice-cream nicely presented and tasty. Overall, good service, good food etc etc, the question remains, are you willing to fork out well north of SGD 500 (without a bottle of wine, glass only) for a pretty normal meal? Good experience, but probably not every week
5
Perfect service. Warm, friendly, courteous, efficient, helpful, understanding and knowledgable.Perfect food. Fusion starters at its best - arty and delish. Perfect steaks.It is noisy, but we had 3 little kids (all under 5) with us, so it works! The waiters and waitresses are so charming and friendly with the kids.There is simply nothing to complain. Love it so much, can't wait to go again
4
Have stopped here a couple of times after a day of shopping to meet people for pre dinner cocktails. The cocktail artists here are something to be witnessed, as is the beautifully kept bar. Between a few of us we have tried a decent amount on the list and I have to say Every single one is so delicious. My favorite is HELP! Save the bees.Not going to carry on, just go there. You will be thanking me if you love a good cocktail. I'm sure the food is spectacular too
3
If you're feeling a little isolated in Singapore I guess you could go here and pretend you're in LA. But you're not and the indifferent attitude from the floor staff doesn't disguise the overpriced and average meals - in fact it highlights it.
4
Great service, food as you would expect for the price. However the staff are very genuine and when my husband left his iPhone at the restaurant they did everything possible to contact us and let us know.
3
Let me say first of all that the food is consistently good. Although I went there for the steak and thoroughly enjoyed my aged ribeye on the bone wih various sauces, my entree of scallop carpaccio in a ponsu sauce was also delicious. However, the service was relentless and unacceptably poor. For example, I was asked how my starter was before I had even tasted it, I was asked if I wanted another glass of wine within 30 seconds of having just ordered one from someone else, I was asked if I wanted a dessert within 30 seconds of having already ordered the bill from someone else and it was suggested to me that I should enjoy my steak whilst it was hot whilst I was waiting for my side order of french fries to arrive. This is simply over the top with too many people trying to do the same job and no-one really succeding in providing quality service, which to me means being both observant and discrete. The ambiance of the restaurant is also spoilt by intrusively loud music and dark lighting, the latter making it difficult to read menus and bills. Lastly, it is ridiculously expensive and certainly the worst value of money of all the flagship restaurants in the Marina Bay Sands Complex. Go to DB or Osteria Mozza opposite Cut instead
5
We ate here for the second time and was not disappointed. The previous time we did not bring our son as we had a baby sitter, but this time we were staying at the hotel and thought we would take him along. Whilst there is no kids menu, there was plenty for him to eat. There is complimentary mini cheese rolls and cheese pretzels along with bread (he was almost full before we started on the other food) We ordered a potato puree (mash) and Mac and Cheese for him and he loved them both. The service was excellent. Staff are very attentive
5
My wife and I went to dinner last night and had the best time. As soon as we sat down, we were well attended to throughout the dinner, not overwhelming at all. Highly recommended. We both had the USDA Prime cuts, the rib eye and the sirloin. I would say the rib eye was better between the two but still both great steaks. We started with the bone marrow flan which you definitely need to try and the shrimp cocktail was also delicious but the bone marrow starter is something again you'll all have to taste.Would go again in a heartbeat. The wine list is incredible as well. If there is room for dessert, we had shared the strawberry shortcake which was unreal too and I don't even like dessert
5
Having grown up on a beef cattle stud property, which we re-visit regularly, finally here it was .. the best restaurant steak my chef-trained partner has ever had! I've previously visited CUTs in both LA's Beverley Wilshire and at the Venetian in Vegas for corporate dinners, so we knew this newbie Singapore eatery would be good. We went for the Illinois 395g rib eye fillet, so can only wonder how the Wagyu would outperform, next time! CUT exceeded our expectations with a particularly elegant dining room, the usual superb and personable service and a stunning glass walled wine cellar to marvel at enroute to the loos. It is impressive that in such a top class restaurant, staff can make the service experience warm and friendly with genuine questions and conversations about your trip etc. Do allow time to find the restaurant, as it is not in the Marina Bay Sands hotel tower, but instead past the casino in the Shoppes complex. Struggling with time zones we actually arrived quite early for our reservation, which staff handled without missing a beat. One last tip... by the time you also have sides, it is a substantial meal. So if you fancy dessert our tip would be to go easy on the various offered bread options, and also skip starters, unless you have a really healthy appetite! Well done Wolfgang, again
4
The food was excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful. Tried the 100% Jap Wagyu and it was as expected. Excellent. The restaurant is however quite pricy, although quite good especially for a special occasion. (They do ask whether it is a special occasion when you are making the reservation - which is a nice touch I though).I'm not normally a fan of onion rings, but I would definitely recommend them here as starters - they are good. Try the wild mushrooms and brocollini as sides as they go very well with the steaks
5
We had a romantic dinner at cut. We usually only have entree and main, however the food was so amazing we had all courses and were glad we did! The prices are not cheap, however you are getting a dinner that is worth every cent. We have eaten in similar establishments in australia and the service and quality is definitely to another level at Cut.. Will return here next time in Singapore
5
Service: Very good. Morton's does one thing better than Cut - which is to religiously check that each guest is 100% happy with the doneness on their steak (ie, if you asked for "medium rare" you got that and not a "medium"). The bartenders at the bar are top notch.Food: Excellent. The appetizers rock - especially the Butter Lettuce Salad, the Prawn Cocktail, the Veal Tongue and the Kobe Beef Sashimi. The best appetizer without exception is the Bone Marrow Flan - if you have not tried this, then do it. The appetizers are smaller than Morton's, but are a little more technique driven. The steak: I'm a rib-eye guy and they have the Australian bone-in ribeye (which is more lean) and the USDA ribeye (which is fattier) - my usual order is the USDA ribeye and I have never been let down. These guys do a little better job at resting the steak (compared to Mortons which tends to serve the steaks straight off the grill). The cocktails are outstanding.Ambiance: A little "fancier" than Mortons (though that is not necessarily a good thing). If you want a good old steak-house feel then Cut is not for you. The other small problem is you get all manner of random tourists from the casino or Marina Bay Sands (whereas Mortons has a little more of a steak crowd). Last time I came to Cut there was a table of 8 chinese tourists next to me and half of them were wearing those shanghai silk daytime pajama outfits with the matching tops and bottoms and had kids with them.All in all - probably the best restaurant (judged on value, food and service) at Marina Bay Sands and I will certainly continue my fortnightly visits
4
When you think Wolfgang Puck you don’t necessary think of steaks so I wasn’t sure what to expect. But the steaks were great, there were a wide variety of cuts to chose from and they had steaks imported from Australia to the USA (even Japan if I remember correctly) and the price varies accordingly. The sides were a good portion and not your usual veggies and baked potatoes. Service was excellent and the staff were attentive.What was a little off putting was when we made reservations they took pains to remind us of the dress code – smart casual. And they even reminded me when they called to confirm the reservation. But while we were there, we saw them sitting patrons in shorts and tees.
3
Great bar, great food, amazing cocktails, Fantastic bar staff... Shame that the relaxed atmosphere of the cocktail bar had started to attract the occasional drunk rough patron . Hopefully the management and security will sort that probelen soon.

The quality of food and service was good, however the crowd was rather pretentious.
Not the best place for a romantic date, but quite suitable for business/company dinners.
Quite impressed with the selection of cuts on the menu, and excellent wine list.

Cut serves reasonable quality steak but the restaurant lacks character and the service is just plain pretentious. Apparently Wolfgang Puck is a bit of a chain in the US with some reputation. It was okay but there are many better steakhouses around.

Be greeted by the dark warm ambience. And sink in to the warm toasty selection of bread. Pleasurable... if you are a bread lover. Because the choices was quite a range and freshly baked!The New York Sirloin (aged 21 days) was laced with wild fields mushroom. And the French fries with herb was lovely presented. The sautéed brocollini still maintained its crunch and wonderfully flavored with sundried tomato and garlic. Dessert was a sweet ending of chocolate soufflé with cappuccino. All in all, a great dinner!!

Had a great night at Cut restaurant. I was taken there with friends, and not entirely sure what to expect. Contrary to some of the other comments here the service was great throughout the night. I had swimmer crab for my starter which for me stole the show. Immaculately presented and a wonderful dish. The steak was well cooked and the sides were again very well presented. With a bottle of wine included and a couple of pre-dinner drinks the night was complete. I was expecting a large bill but was still surprised at 'how large' it ended up being. We didn't order any of the more expensive steaks on the menu

Oh dear...they just cant get the service right here at all. have been twice in the last two weeks and its pretty dreadful.first time we had to ask for menus and had to flag someone down to take our orderStarters are out in the normal timescale but then ages to clear the starters away then 40 minutes wait for the mail course and no service in between.The place has no leadership or management and is run on chaosFood however is very very goodif you can tolerate terrible service at crazy prices then give it a g

Before we ate at CUT we were well aware of it's reputation as very expensive, therefore I cannot grumble about the massively extortionate prices.However given the very high prices, once expects something close to perfection and unfortunately this wasn't delivered.The service in the bar (before we ate) was very confused, drinks came late, at different times and the staff wouldn't serve us a 'bottle' of champagne, insisting on pouring individual glasses and keeping the bottle behind the bar - it ran out rather quickly than we had expected!The steaks are very good cuts and the selection is very wide, however we all found our food to be cooked one level less than we would normally expect (American style?) and so we all struggled to complete the rather too rare, enormous steak
5
While staying at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) a friend referred Cut as a place to grab a quality cocktail. Though it may have been some of the priciest drinks I've had in my life (it is Singapore so should be expected), the service, preparation, and drinks were some of the best I've had. Some of the bartenders are actually referred to as "Cocktail Engineers" and the drinks are out of this world. Highly suggest for a special occasion for a quality cocktail

Let's start wtih the food.Is this restaurant better than the run-of-mill steak places? Yes it is but shoudn't it be anyways? A fair comparison is probably against places like "Mxxxxx's The Steakhouse" - I found the menu at Cut more interesting but the quality of cuisine poorer.The pet peeves of our party are:1) The request was for the 'cut' (in this case, it was the Bone In Filet Mignon) to be medium but it turned out medium-well and was too charred on the outside!2) Halibut. This was on the menu on the night we were there. The fish is so boring and the pairing was weird, it came with a mixture of saltish short neck clams and sweet corn bits which tasted totally off and didn't go well with the fish. I would support another reviewer's comment to remove fish from the restaurant if they cannot make it work.Now Service...Waiter was in a hurry to take our order and when we finished with the food, he just walked off, leaving us holding the winelist and about to spurt out our drink choices! Actually, this is no big deal compared to how our conversation with this waiter went when he returned to our table to ask, how we would like our food done.The waiter in a hurried tone repeatedly said "ARE YOU SURE", "ARE YOU SURE" several times and was pointing his finger at the person whom he expects the answers from! Initially it sounded wierd but it become very irritating. When we ask this waiter why he repeatedly ask "ARE YOU SURE", he went off to speak to his colleagues about us! We then saw his colleagues catching glimpses of our table.I did noticed a pattern in the reviews. Some folks found the service fine but others had challenges. I think this is due to several Rotten Tomatoes in the restuarant and unluckily we encountered one!I would have given the restaurant a better rating (i.e. average) if not for the service. Ignoring the terrible service, the rating cannot be very good or excellent too because the cuisine doesn't measure up to its closet competitors locally and overseas.It was a maddening outing for us!For your reference, the menu:Salads and Starters… Prime Sirloin “Steak Tartare”, Herb Aioli, Mustard $28 Kobe Steak Sashimi, Spicy Radishes, Upland Cress $32Bone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad $26 Hokkaido Scallop “Carpaccio,” Shaved Myoga, Wasabi-Kosho Ponzu $41Crispy Stuffed Squash Blossoms “Panzanella” Gremolata, Confit Tomato, Lemon $22Prawn “Cocktail,” Wasabi Panna Cotta, Celery Salt, Avocado Mousse, Yuzu Citrus $28 Roasted Baby Beets, Humbolt Fog Goat Cheese, Toasted Pistachios, Citrus, Micro Basil, Mint $22Heirloom Apple Salad, Fennel, Red Endive, Medjool Dates, Marcona Almonds, Shropshire Cheese $26Butter Lettuce, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette $29 American Blue Crab and Shrimp “Louis,” Spicy Tomato-Horseradish $38Warm Veal Tongue, Marinated Artichokes, Cannellini Beans, “Salsa Verde” $26 Blue Fin Tuna Tartare, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger, Togarashi Crisps, Tosa Soy $37Warm Asparagus, Poached Egg, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette $21 Austrian Oxtail Bouillon, Chervil, Bone Marrow Dumplings $32 Grilled Over Hard Wood & Charcoal Then Finished Under A 1200 Degree Broiler…U.S.D.A.

Went to CUT for a client dinner because we were told it was one of the best steakhouses in Singapore. The quality of the produce on offer is very good, a good selection from the U.S and Australia. However the execution was a let down, we felt it didn't do justice to the produce itself. Service was scattered and at times clumsy, our server's sales pitch was excessive and when we questioned him on some of the products, his response was unconvincing. Including wine, a very expensive night out. Have dined at many fine steakhouses around the world, unfortunately this will be count as one of those on the list
4
we just had 2 desserts-chocolate soufflé and baked alaska. Wonderful but pricey!

I picked two nice restaraunts on TA for my Singapore weekend, this one beats my other choice and the other choice gets a very good to excellent as well. dining alone it was easy to grab a seat at the bar for a full meal, it was Saturday so maybe just lucky. here they have the bar, the lounge, restaraunt and able to close some doors to create a private party in the back. I did the tour on everything but the kitchen and bathroom. OK a soft start with a glass of pinot noir I didn't care for but I got it down and moved on. blown away from my first starter the blue fin tartar, truley refreshing and just cant describe how nice it is. didn't know how they could follow this but the scond choice was the bone marrow flan, tuff toss up, this starter is so rich and delish and blends well mixing all the flavors on the plate togther or on its own still good. evryone around me was doing mixed drinks so I got into them easy. they have many exotic concoctions to choose from and all going at 27 Sinapore dollars. I did a spicy jalapeno one first, the names r to crazy to remember but they have a menu of a good 40. never touched the bread and dinner rolled out not much long after. I got the cheapest for staek I think, a 85 dollar rib eye medium rare and another star to my dining enjoyment was the creamed spinach. the steak done perfect but here comes guys, I'm a big fish/chicken eater. OK have to admit the steak was awesome and they serve it with some mustards to dip in. again sounds wierd maybe not but what a pair. my creamed spinach was blended for me after I got the pic. good side here, I made sure I finished all the spinach before the steak which I damaged about 70% and threw in the towel. what a dinner super satisfied and yes a bit pricey but I recommend you try it once, killer appetizers and cocktails. incredible wine list. Now dining alone has its ups and downs after the food part, here again I recommend if you have to dine alone, come to the bar. my host was Freda"RICO" who kept me entertained all night with the other 2 bartenders. made some friends from Sumatra who both ordered the 285 dollar wagyu rib eyes and said its the best %@#!*& steak they ever had. it was as if I dined with friends and kida guess it was. most enjoyable night. Rico gave me the tour of the restaraunt and showed me the wines and private wines and many of the nice labels of Screaming Eagle and other things beyond my budget. I didn't hit the casino so they were out of my league but the wine menu is huge and has all categories available. I left out one more Thai Ladies ??? mixed drink that taste like tom yum soup cold and spicey, just another nice touch to the night. this place works for me well and I'm not much of a steak eater, fun dining at the bar. my tab snuck away at 274 dollars for one. wouldnt think about regrets just should I come again, I think so

This is my second time to CUT. The first was an overall good experience and so I thought to bring my whole team (there were 10 of us) there for a celebratory dinner. Overall the food was still good except that the waitress who was serving us was pushing the team for the pricier cuts of meat and when I decided to order apetizers to share, she was not happy. In the end,some of my colleagues couldn't even finish the food (proving her wrong that the apetizers were too few). She really had an "attitude" which spoilt the whole evening for us. I thought I was the only one who noticed it until my other colleagues commented too that she needs to improve her service skills and smile more. When we were done and I had to sign the bill, I asked her if it was only one copy I should sign. Her response was just an indignant nod - not even a "yes please". She had also just barged in to remove my colleague's empty wine glass right in the middle of our conversation without even saying "excuse me". To be fair, there was another male waiter who gave us excellent service.Pushing more expensive items on the menu is left best to open-air seafood restaurants and the like. When one comes to such an establishment, we are prepared to pay but not want to necessarily order the most expensive item. I know the restaurant prices and didn't expect to get away cheap but the waiter kept topping up our glasses with water even though we had stopped drinking the water. The bill for the water (8 bottles) came up to $144. My suggestion is that out of courtesy, the restaurant should always ask the host if they want to open up another bottle of water. I have dined in many fine restaurants around the world and there is nothing wrong with doing this. I think it'll be a long time before I patronise this restaurant again

I have been to CUT 2 times...first out of curiousity because it was new. Second time because I thought that the place had to be better than my first experience given the hype..I thot/hoped it was just an off nite. It was not. Before I get started I dine out a lot..3 or 4 nites a week...middle to high end places and steak is one of my vices. You wont here me complain about prices because anyone going to a place like CUT should know what they are in for and just suck it up.On both visits here we were in an out of the place in under 90 minutes. Our bills were in the 800-950 range for 2 with wine...same as Mortons here or Lugers in NYC of Ruth Chris...it is what it is...Service...generally poor...wine waiter knew his stuff. ..half the staff seemed to just wander aimlessly and epsite gesturing and waving at them we were left alone...EXCEPT when our wine glases got below half full then they were right there pouring away! Had to tell them to chill a couple of times...I am not into 2 bottle dinners with only 2 people. Steaks were good but not exceptional. Mortons remains the standard here in Singapore certainly. Cocktails were OK but must have come froma different planet given the time they took to arrive.Music annoyed me the first time and I was able to tune it out the next time.Ambiance is totally lacking..but then again this is in a shopping mall in a casino..be prepared to see all kinds of group eating styles when you go there...ask for a booth if you hope to have any peace and quiet to talk...tables way too close together..its not for a romantice dinner..

We were in Singapore as part of our Honeymoon and had planned a special dinner to celebrate.We ordered the porter house which was perfect. The wine list was also to die for.But without doubt the best part of Cut was Rico the amazing bartender!He made our evening extra special and lots of fun!! Thank you!!Over all a must do for any trip to Singapore.Lucy and Ian x

Took the Mrs there for a Mother's Day treat and it turned out to be the most expensive meal I've ever paid for, but I don't regret a penny of it. Food and service were top notch and the unexpected background rock music worked a treat...I'd far rather have U2 and the Rolling Stones than piped musak or some bloke on a piano.Anyway, the food and service. There was no rush, we were seated at the table, left with the food and wine menus and topped with water while we took it all in. The breads and amuse bouche were fresh, plentiful and tasty...but we took care not to fill ourselves before the main event.To begin with, we had the butter lettuce and blue cheese salad and the maple glazed pork belly. And here's where the service started to kick in. Instead of just bringing out both dishes, they divided each into two plates and served them as separate course. It worked a treat, a small but appreciated little extra touch and these things make a difference. The lettuce was fresh and crisp with the salad nicely dressed, the cheese adding a creamy punch. Full of flavour, wonderful. The pork belly was a melt-in-the-mouth joy.For the mains, the Mrs went for Filet Mignon - incidentally, slightly cheaper than the Morton's equivalent. Taking advantage of her frugality, I splurged S$230 on the tasting plate - 120g USDA Prime, 120g Kobe and 60g Wagyu (from Shiga Prefecture, for the experts). And I'd do it again. The waiter helpfully advises you to taste the steaks in the order listed to fully appreciate the qualities and differences. Good advice. The steaks were cooked exactly to our liking and the quality was evident. We purred through each bite.We ordered too many sides, but made a decent effort in trying to polish them off. Yukon Gold potato puree, fingerling potatoes with smoked bacon and pearl onions and a ragout of sugar snap peas. All wonderful.Desserts were also as good as it gets - and to accompany them, we ordered a couple of glasses of Malmsey. To be fair, both were for me, the Mrs was full to the point of explosion. Now, here was an excellent touch from the restaurant. A few minutes after ordering, the waitress returned with two glasses of non-Malmsey dessert wine - they had run out of Malmsey so gave us (me) the closest equivalent on the house. No need to do that, but a nice touch.Throughout, the service was professional, friendly and respectful. No complaints about that or the food. Pretty expensive at S$800 all in, but don't regret any of it and I'll certainly be back

Went there for my anniversary dinner with my hubby. As we arrived very late (10pm), we were hungry, so we skipped the appetizers and went straight for the mains. We decided to try their Porterhouse Steak (980g) recommended for 2 to share. We had it done medium and it was served exactly that. Steak was slightly "crisp brown" on the outside and pink and juicy on the inside. Excellent execution by the chef! The waiter expertly "deboned" the steak and split it between me and my husband. I realised that this T-bone/porterhouse came with a filet mignon on one side and another part (forgot which part of the cow) on the other side of the bone. So we had a chance to try 2 parts of the beef in one order. Hubby loved it so much. He ate every leftover meat on the bone. We ordered creamed spinach with eggs and I loved that! We were also served a selection of bread (love the onion focaccia) and we asked to try all the 4 types of bread served. Overall the food and service was excellent. I found the waiters friendly and not snooty despite this being a fine dining place.. And they were v attentive. They gave us a complimentary dessert of coconut and blue berry ice cream at the end and that was excellent! Never tried such yummy ice cream. We might return for another special occasion though I must say it is quite costly. It cost us $250 for just 2 mains, 1 side dish and still mineral water. If u order appetizers and desserts, be prepared to spend $200 and above each. If u will be trying their Wagyu beef, then prob $250 to $300 each. Overall I liked the restaurant very much. The only issue was that they played loud contemporary music and that made it difficult for us to hear the waiters. And the loud music did not make the plsce b I remarked to my husband about the odd music selection for a fine dining establishment, but I later realised this might be the "theme" of this restaurant- modern contemporary. And the loud music was prob important for the people at the bar
5
Frankly speaking, I tried lamb chop with "C" in Shanghai, "M" in Macau and grill in other places, they can never cooked to what I want, generally is over cooked. Tonight, at CUT, I am so happy with the lamp chop that I ordered, no just because of the meat quality, but also it is cooked to what I expect. I finished my dinner with chocolate souffle, so good, but I just can't finished it.
4
Cut is one of those restaurants where you pay through your nose for good food but it doesnt feel complete because inevitably you will compare the dining experience against those overseas with a similar price point and realised that the service area falls short here. I would be happier if they allow BYOs which was flatly refused even though it was my in laws 40th wedding annivesary. Even a cake is disallowed so what a shame. What a crying sham
3
The location is good; popular among tourists and the 'wannabe hip'. The decor, trendy and chic. The drinks and bartenders, coached with a set routine that at first seems 'corny' but visually appealing - and admitedly, the drinks weren't bad. The service was attentive and food presentation was average. But most importantly, the food was only 'blah' and somewhat disappointing. And the prices, oh the prices...tsk tsk, on the steep side and really not value for money when you benchmark it against restaurants with the same pedigree. I had the wagyu steak which wasnt cooked well and the garnishings weren't that yummy. Overall, i was not impressed and wouldnt patronize the place again - it just wasnt very good. Sorry Mr Puck
5
Great Steak, Great wine, lovely atmosphere and brilliant service.
If you are not on a budget, you must go here.
5
High class steakhouse in Singapore - highly recommended for beef lovers!
4
Best steaks I've had in Singapore... I would still rate Rockpool in Melbourne better though. Our wagyu steaks were done to perfection... And we didn't really need to add any of the sauce we'd ordered on the side. The service was great and though the tables are fairly close together in some sections, the place isn't noisy and the atmosphere is nice. At 200+ apiece, this is a place only for special occasions. Definitely worth visiting if u have the budget and the occasion :
5
They took my reservation via email with HK mobile and were not fussy that only 4 of us showed up instead of 6. We only had to wait for 3 minutes at the bar... where the barman was very naughty reading out a list of cocktails with sexy names - we were entertained.Service was impeccable, food - delicious, portions - large, even though we skipped starters, one of my friends could not finish her steak! Good selection of wine and cocktails came in designer glasses.Yes, it comes at a price.. but it feels good. We'll be back
2
Although the reputation of Chef Puck is based on beef, I ordered Dover Sole. It must be one of the worst sole dish I have ever had. My fellow dinners took pity on my predicament and shared their Japanese Waguyu beef steak with me. That was a lot better but still not to the standard I expect of a celebrity chef. My advise - avoid if you have a choice.
4
Stylishly decked out restaurant, although it's almost too cool, the lighting is so low it does take your eyes a while to adjust. The food is well prepared, although I personally found the medium rare steak I had a bit dry, which for £45 for the steak is a bit disappointing. Service however is amazing, lots of attention to detail, very attentive but not obtrusive, almost worth going to see the staff at work to be honest. Very slick
4
Cool and stylish new age steakhouse atmosphere that's "lit up" by the food on the table. The well trained, knowledgeable and friendly staff takes you through the menu until you have found what you thought you had been looking for. Excellent beef, aged and grilled to perfection. The tower of fries is a cumbersome signature side dish as is the spinach. Try a bottle of Alter Ego with your steak
5
The best steaks outside japan that i have ever tried. Try their american wagyu fillet or tenderloin. The sides and thesauces are mouth watering. Service is a bit shaky. Their waiters are mostly asian and they seem to be a bit ackward talkin and behaving like an american waiter. Wines are expensive. Desserts can be avoided, nothing special. There is a tall caucasian lady managers. I would go back again just to be served by her. Amazing sense of servic
3
AT $200 plus for 2 steak dinners with no drinks or dessert, I was not impressed. The waiter brought over just Wagyu types to show us at $30-$60 an ounce. When we instead chose regular prime off the menu service went downhill. The steaks were overcooked, and I would have rather gone to Morton's and had a soufflé for dessert.If you won a bundle at the casino, then go and have some wagyu beef, otherwise, avoid them
5
We had a fantastic meal at Cut, and would go again. It is certainly a place for steak lovers.I had the Japanese Wagyu (expensive at SGD $280) and my wife the American Wagyu Rib Eye which was a little bit cheaper. Both were cooked perfectly and were divine. I would probably not get the Japanese Wagyu next time, not because it wasn’t perfect, but it was just so rich with the incredible marbling. I would prefer a small taste of the Japanese Wagyu and then bite into something like the American Wagyu. Would be great if they had a small tasting platter to experience the differences between the breeds and cuts. We were impressed that the cuts of meat were brought to the table and all explained in detail before we ordered. We also had some sides which were very generous in size - the tempura onion rings came in a tower like stack.The wine list was extensive and relatively normally priced for a fine dining restaurant. The staff were very attentive.The restaurant is in a somewhat odd location within the shopping part of the Marina Bay Complex, however the décor and atmosphere was very modern, with the wine displays/cellar built into the walls which was interesting.A must for steak lovers and foodies or to celebrate a special occasion. On the expensive side, however it certainly provides for a genuinely good experience. Reservations are a must
5
Just like in Las Vegas (in Palazzo) this is a Must for steak lovers. There really is only one Negative about the place: It is very pricey! But it is worth it for one night - super great steaks, awesome sides, good service and ambience
5
Nice but very expensive when you consider the portion size.
4
The Wangyu beef steaks were amongst the best I have had anywhere. Definitely expensive but you get a fantastic meal for sure
5
Most beautiful steak I've ever tasted. Absolutely gorgeous, couldn't recommend more highly beautiful dining room, best service I've experienced all round just fantastic.
3
I got the $280 steak and my wife got the $210 my daughter the USA filet and my sone the Rangers (au) all of them seamed over seasoned? Cooked properly but everything else on the plate and the sides I wouldn't rate well. The service was trying to please but lacked delivery. eg: ordered Martinis and had to ask twice if we would get them soon. Got them and just after that got our meals? Not somthing I like! I know it's not London Paris or Sydney but if you open it you should run it properly $1360.00 for 4 mains a $300 bottle 2 cocktails and 2 coke and some San pell. We like fine dinning and do it often all over the world but this is not on my list. Sorry mr Puck but you have to be there
4
Yes, indeed a very cozy place for dating couples but will bang your bucks as the food is quite pricey. We ordered the Angus Beef and it was perfectly done, and i so love their potato puree, really creamy. :) will definitely come back but only if there's something special to celebrate about ;
5
A bit of an odd atmosphere - 60's rock and roll muzak? But really excellent total experience. Staff was very engaged and understood and implemented my odd eating rituals. Wine list was fantastic - not many places that have the treasures from my cellar on the menu. Steak nearly perfect, side dishes perfect. Portions a little large for a single traveler who doesn't want to take anything home. All in all really a great experience. Now go back and add "but a little pricey" to every sentence in the review
5
What a great place! We had a fantastic meal at Cut and it is on our list of great restaurants to visit again and again.Cut was set up by American celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck and is in the Marina Bay Complex. It is difficult to find in that massive place but well worth the effort.We were given a booth table and enjoyed chatting to the staff who were friendly and unobtrusive - top marks for Puck's training.I have seen from previous reviews that some patrons were not happy with the music being played in the restaurant ( all Wolfgang Puck's favourites, apparently) - we loved it! Unusually for this type of restaurant the lighting was good and it was easy to read the very interesting menu.Now onto the food and what food! My husband started with the American blue crab and shrimp with spicy tomato-horseradish sauce while I opted for the prawn cocktail with wasabi panna cotta and avocado mousse - both dishes were divine.Next up the main course. The available steak choices are brought raw to the table so diners can see exactly what they are getting. We both opted for the American Wagyu/Kobe style beef from Idaho. My husband had the 280g rib eye steak while I chose the 230g New York sirloin. We ordered the tempura onion rings and the french fries as side dishes.The steak was excellent and we savoured every mouthful. Both side dishes were presented in a tower shape - which looked great but proved impractical to get onto our plates.This is a very expensive restaurant and it was full so make a reservation. Fantastic place for a special occasion
5
Not cheap but the Wolfgang Puck has taken fine dining to the next level. The steaks were amazing. A sample tray was brought to the table for the meat selection. My wife ordered the fish and it was deboned table side!I would certainly go back again
4
It is a steak house, if you like steak cooked perfectly this is your place. After being to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in Las Vegas, as soon as i saw the name i was going to eat here, however the difference in price between the two is very substantial. That shock aside it is relative / a bit more pricey than top of the line Australian places so i reconciled the difference and ordered. The food was cooked to perfection, i just found the service below expectations for the tier of restaurant it is. When asking for a table for two the only availability was a seat at the bar (i actually prefer the bar, as there is staff interaction) and this is where the service aspect let me down. We sat down and staff took a drink order, then after several minutes apologised and said sorry do you want dinner? Then when ordering the staff kept getting the order confused and took 3 people to understand even after pointing on the menu, what steak i wanted and how i wanted it cooked. The service just felt inattentive and confusing. I am sure this was an anomaly and i do recommend dining here, however for the tier of restaurant it promotes itself as, and the pricing points that is set, it definitely soured the experience. Overall if you want a great steak come here, if it is a special occasion where you want everything to flow seamlessly, book in advance.
5
best steak ever ! went back on my last night, but it was closed on sundays. will have to make another trip just to eat there
disliked the price...ha ha
5
Eventhough the price was expensive the food and service were great
5
unbeatable for food and atmosphere. great wine list and knowledgeable staff. Be prepared for a second mortgage, but well worth it
3
This was a one off for a special occasion so I have no regrets and overall I enjoyed the meal and the experience. The food was excellent and the restaurant itself was trendy, well positioned and had excellent staff who were very efficient and attentive.A couple of downsides - 1) the music was far too loud and spoilt the atmosphere rather than add to it, and 2) the prices were simply exorbitant and a modest meal for 2 with a couple of drinks(not even a bottle of wine) was Â£250 sterling.Would I return - probably not, the restaurant is a bit up itself and obviously starting to believe in its own publicity. Would I recommend to a friend - no, there are many dining options in Singapore that are better in terms of venue, quality and price
4
Normally I would avoid dining in restaurants for dinner when the the restaurants are located in aShopping Mall ---but this is different and I guess Marina Sands is quite different also . I can highly recommend Cut - Delicious food , great wine, excellent service .... oh and begin your evening with a dry Martini - very very good 
5
Nine of us in a group went for dinner at Cut . The steak is probably the best in Singapore and the appetizers and desserts are very tasty and down to earth. We had Pinot noir from the US which company the meal very well. Very professional and passionate staff, truly first class experience of course the bill too. The bar has very unique cocktails, I had "crouching tiger" very refreshing. The bar snack is excellent as well

The ambience is nice for a romantic dinner, softly bathed in candle light. Howeverthe music is totally incompatible with the ambience ranging from elton john to heavymetal,,,,strange concoction of music. We were initially seated in a small table for two butwe requested to the more comfortable booth seats which was really cosy and the sofas were soft leather, vs squeezing onto a small table with plasticky seats with skinny legs,,, Also make sure you dont get a window seat, which means you will be looking out at the shops of MBS and have curious people staring back at you...We had rose champagne which is always a good way to start.Bread : had 4 varieties of bread ranging from pretzel to olive to onion. Butter withroasted salt and pepper was tasty but the bread was unfortunately cold and couldn'tbeat the real hot breads from the michellin french restaurants where the warm hotbread is in a world of their own. Here, the cold bread remained cold on our plates. Seriously, they have to learn to bake better bread and to serve them warm and fragrant,,,Starter : foie gras - spouse described it as heavenly butter. Powdery soft anddecadent.Maine lobster with black truffles - succulent and yet muscular, and the blacktruffles add a nice exotic touch to the sea-saltedness of the usual crustacean. She regretted ordering the 1.5kg giant vs the 1kg which is already more than adequate. The claws, though, were strangely custardly powdery but the rest of the lobster was good.For starter, I had pork belly with fuji apple puree. The pork belly was well roasted with acaramelised crusty outside, a tad too saltish for me but nevertheless for a tapassize starter, good and promising start.The captain pushed a trolly and went over the intricacies of each of the various kinds of beef and their different cuts etc,,,,Finally I settled on USA snake farm sirloin steak, marbled and done medium with organic fried egg and caramelised onions. The beef was certainly very well-roasted with charred outsides and moist pink insides. And yet it doesn't have the dreary buttery oily taste of the heavily-marbled japanese wagyu. The greedy me went further to order the fried organic egg, mashed potato etc with the beef. My advice : Just focus on the meat,,,the rest are not memorable garnishings. As a side ordear, we had wild field mushrooms with japanese shishito peppers. Nice but not memorable.We had soursop sorbet which was a good way to end the evening as we were obviously too full from all the meat (which we never finished).But beef for beef, this is one of the better places around and am glad that with MBS, we have a higher level of sophiscation to our traditional steak restaurants like Lawrys and Mortons (which certainly doesnt come close to the taste of the Cut).Total bill : Just over S$700

Before anyone reads this please understand that we know our food and eat out and love all types of restaurants. Simply, the service was average, slow with poor english. The food descriptions were nothing so poor the food did not resemble them at all. Imagine this description. "caramelised onions, parmigano and mashed potato" and getting some flavorless potato in puff pastry with a horrible mustard. Just poor.Anyway, the steak was excellent. One of the best I have had. Just for 70$ and 170g. I know it it marina bay and WP. But seriously. Don't go and make them up their gam

we went to Cut beacuse it was next door to the theatre and it looked nice on the web.......however no prices are shown for the incredible charge that they place on the meat. $90 for the cheapest Sirloin and up to $250 for the taster....before any sides!Now we have eaten in many to the top restaurants all over the world and paid a lot more for a meal but they came as an experience......not just Steak and Fries!Singapore has lot to offer in the way of places to "experience" for foodies......my advice "dont bother with CUT" over priced for a Steak Dinner
2
i love food and i love steak. went for the best they had a $250 steak tasting trio. was extremely average. Shame as Puck is normally a genius and i was really looking forward to this meal. US$800 no alcohol and none of us finished the meal. i eat in some of the best restaurants in the world and i know what Cut is capable from Vegas etc but this was not even in the same league. the waiter didnt even know his steaks, anyway, design super cool, excellent clientele and very good service but food was far below par. i hope they get bette
3
The restaurant is nice and the staff very attentive, good wines and good location inside the Sands.
Unfortunately we found the meat too expensive for the quality we got and we will probably try a different restaurant next time.
5
One must try the amazing whisky based cocktails at Cut. The artful performance of making the cocktail along with the surprising and satisfying taste, make this a must have experience. Cheers!
5
Service was professional, and exudes a welcoming feel! Appetizers ordered included the prawn dish and the apple salad, fantastic! Steak were better than Mortons, and they even fillet the Dover Sole right in front of us. A great place for business/posh dining

We've been to CUT twice. The first time, we paid $950 for 4 adults who only had 1 alcoholic beverage each. My favorite part of that meal were the starters. I recall having a wonderful wasabi tartare. The freebies are nice too--Parm bread twists, cheezy bread balls, etc. This is a very high end steakhouse--they present the beef to you and explain all of the details. They have some fine meat. My husband and I did the sampler platter and it was pretty good. I felt the cuts were tiny for what we were paying. Fantastic service both times. The second visit was for fun, before a show. We had the Waygu beef sliders and a couple of drinks. It was almost $100. But the sliders are AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGG. I could have eaten 3 orders of them for dinner. So just be aware of what it is you're getting into when you go to CUT. If you want a luxury experience and amazing service, then go there. But don't be expecting to get a lot for your $$, and be prepared to pay
5
I already had their tasting menu last year, and I loved it. This time I brought my mother so she can have it for her birthday treat. They certainly didn't disappoint. The customer service has always been superb. You can see it from the way they attend to you -- just spill a little of your water, and suddenly the waiter is there to wipe your table. They take such good care in serving the portions, and explaining the dishes. Since I had emailed them about my mother's occasion, the executive sous chef even went out of the kitchen just to greet her. Oh, if you are getting the tasting menu, make sure you don't drink too much liquid or eat a lot of bread, because even though the courses are small, they are A LOT. It is quite pricey, but definitely worth the experience
5
I had the U.S.D.A. Illinois grain-fed petit filet, and it was one of the better steaks I've ever had. It was incredibly tender and the flavor was excellent. While they brought out four sauces to try with the steak, none of them were necessary. The butter lettuce salad with blue cheese and avocado was a perfect appetizer. The mac and cheese was excellent and well worth it as a side. I had the apple crisp for dessert, and in accordance with the rest of my order it was fantastic. If you wanted to save a few bucks, I'm sure you could skip the dessert and find some more reasonably priced ice cream somewhere. To wash it down I ordered a half-bottle of a 2003 French, Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine was excellent. Yes, it was expensive. Unless you are eating and drinking at a hawker stand, all of the food in Singapore will be expensive. If you can afford it, treat yourself to a dinner at Cut. Dinner with an appetizer, a few sides and a bottle of wine should run you around $500 SGD
5
We went to CUT on a Saturday night. I made the reservation about 5 days in advance. The restaurant is located in the mall near the casino. It's nicely decorated and has a really good vibe-I loved the music they were playing! We had a drink at the bar- the bartenders make some great coctails and its fun to watch them. Our waiter / host was Alvin. He was amazing and made the night. We selected a unreal wine which was 430 SGD. The steaks were all cooked to perfection. I had teh US Wagyu sirloin- yum! The starters especially the pork were also all spot on. Dessert - Apple crumble also very nice. We were there about 3 hours Alvin had us try a few different wines on the house- which were also fantastic. Okay its expensive - its really expensive . But it was one of the best meal /experiences I have had in a long long time. It also helped to be with another great couple who were tons of fun! I would 100% go back again.

Had a great meal at CUT a couple of days ago. Always wanted to go there but the occasion was never right.Whilst waiting for our table, we ordered drinks from the bar. One of my colleague does not drink alcohol but the bar tender offered to make her a mocktail which was not on the standard drinks menu. (Nice touch)Another nice touch is that although CUT is a meat lovers delight, they accommodated requests for special dishes for a vegetarian and a vegan. (Do call ahead if you want this)The steak that I had was "melt in the mouth" and it was the best steak that I had in a long time.One comment though, be resistant to the "upsell" efforts when ordering the wine. Not complaining here. Be sure of what you want, and they have a very wide range, and not succumb to the suggestions of the Sommelier. An overall excellent dining experience, great food and wine in a very nice atmosphere
5
We dined in this gorgeous restaurant to celebrate my 30th birthday. I decided to lash out and order the $280 rib eye wagyu with a side of mushrooms and marrow. The steak was a piece of protein that decided it was a piece of buttery heaven. It was cooked perfectly and retained a stunning char flavour with the silky marbaling texture. The dessert was equally impressive and great value for the portion size. I can't wait to return to Singapore to dine here againFood 9/10 service 8.5/10 decor 9/1

If one had to compare CUT, it is inevitable that one will compare it to the grand dame of steaks - Morton's. On its own, the CUT ranks amongst the top few steakhouses in Singapore. Their array of appetizers and main courses are both interesting and refreshing in presentation, idea, and delivery. However, once a person compares CUT to Morton's - CUT seems to stumble on e final hurdle - taste. It just somehow lacks the X-factor which Morton's delivers time and time again. The stratospheric pricing too does not help
4
Top class service and sensational food are the norm at the Cut. The only problems remain the fact that it is within a shopping centre - terrible views if you are sat facing outwards - and the hidesously expensive wine. Worth the visit though.
5
Pros
(1) Great steaks. Better than Mortons.
Cons
(1) Restaurant a bit dark
4
Go on an expense account and order the aged beef. The hang their own in Sing. Closest to a high end NY steak house I've tasted in Asia. Attractive staff, but could use so more training.
4
We liked;Some of the best steak we have ever tasted (and we have eaten lots, all around the world). The US Kobe-style is not to be missed.Amazing wine list, especially US Napa valley. We liked less;The prices, especially for the winesThe tables are a bit close, and the atmosphere a bit busy and congested at timesThe location in a huge shopping mall is a bit strange for a top class restaurant with these prices.Overall, the quality of the steaks is so good that we will be back, for sure
2
The rating here is on value: the steaks are over-the-top, as are the prices. This is a place you go only if you have a huge expense account. And even then it doesn't quite make the grade. This place may fall victim to the high costs of rent at MBS

Was invited for dinner in CUT by my bosses and I must say that it had quite a good crowd that evening for a regular weeknight.We arrived early and thought we could start with some nibbles while waiting for the other boss.At the door,we were asked by the elegant and calm hostess if we preferred to sit at the bar or at the dining table. We chose the latter and immediately were greeted by a senior wait staff whom presented the menus. Efficiently,he took our wine and aptizers orders. Following that,we were overloaded with their to-die-for bread rolls by a junior staff whom believed that we should be fed with much more than what we asked for - then only to have the senior wait staff to chide us to go easy on the (free) rolls ! He even TAPPED on my back while saying that. Very personal and dedinitely charming indeed. My other boss arrived when the aptizers were almost done therefore "attempted" to order a few more aptizers to sample. This was almost impossible,as the same senior wait staff RECOMMENDED that it will be more ideal to go straight to the Main. We didn't understand the rush hence ordered another 3 appetizers to share. The starters were on point (Bone Barrow was divine). Now the Mains saw the Chicken sent back as it was way undercooked (bloody at some part).The grain-fed beef with sauce accompaniment was very much what I expected : Excellent. Ordered individual desserts and they were above average too,though could do with more choices. Very ironic but this senior wait staff,initially recommended us to order only ONE DESSERT to share without even checking if we could do with more. If the aim is to un-optimize their guests' spending power,then it's their problem but making us feel like we were uncivilized hungry barbarians was another. Overall,good food with efficient service (there was abundance of wait staff) however; condescending,overly-casual,and not passionate at giving guests a memorable experience by going the extra mile. Oh,bad taste in music too. Please stick to one genre to show some serious identity,please

food was great. i mean its hard for the food to not be great in a place like cut. its menu comprising predominantly of meats which are not the toughest thing in a kitchen to pull off.disappointing because for the price point there is no wow factor like there is at santi or db.that would also have been acceptable however the quality of drinks they serve and time they take to serve those diluted drinks with condensation on the outside of the glass is unaaceptable at an establishment like CUT. Two times i ordered a locked and loaded and it took 25 minutes the first time and 20 the second. At bith those times the drink was over diluted and lacked flavour. I should not have ordered it a second time. If anyone was to consider goin i would recommend they stick to bottled beers or wine.i must say that there was a light in the tunnel. The somellier is amazing and has a fabulous wine list with great representation from the US. For that alone i shall be back. hope its better the next time around
5
I went there for a birthday party. The host of the party already set the menu for her guests. I had blue fin tuna tartare for appetizer. Kobe style steak with sauteed mushroom, caramelized carrot, creamy spinach and polenta for the main course, and banana creme brulee for dessert. All I can say is this place is amazing
5
Chose to have dinner @ CUT,since it was so close to the theatre where Lion King was playing.Little did we we know the dining surprise we were in for.Greeted by the GM,Adam,we were seated in a spacious booth.Both Adam and our server ,Tracy,were so knowledgable it was unbelievable.I could go on for hours,but I can reccommend everything.The cocktails are to die for,Crouching Tiger for Vodka drinkers and Pepinos Revenge for all of us Tequila lovers.CUT is the place

We are delighted to see such good restaurants appearing in Singaporeâ€™s Marina Bay Sands Shoppes where the shops reportedly are exceeding revenue targets as MBS Corporation recovers its $6 billion investment in the Marina Bay Sands complex. CUT and Wolfgang Puck were very smart to capture diners' hearts early with tasty cheese bread sticks and four kinds of bread: olive, sourdough, pretzel, and onion bread. All were exceptionally good. We split a USDA prime aged petite cut filet mignon 170g and Butternut squash, dates, and nuts. The finishing under a 1200 degree broiler made the outside delicious, and the steak was juicy and tender inside. We recommend the USDA Prime steak at CUT. We ordered the steak without sauce, and they brought different flavors of mustard to complement the steak. Many restaurants in Singapore neglect sweet dessert wines, but we were happy that CUT offered "Noble One" dessert wine to go with a baked Alaska with blueberry compote, also recommended. The price was commensurate with a first class restaurant with predictable quality, and service was friendly and efficient. For couples who want to have a little privacy but a nice view, we recommend a table for two at the front of the restaurant section against the wall that is farthest from the entrance. There is space between the wall and the passageway to the bar for just one very private table

This place is just perfect! If you like steak just go!
5
This restaurant is something special. Great food, fantastic environment and extremely friendly staff, especially Thomas.
Thanks for a great evening.

JB has perfected the art of cooking which makes this steak house above all the rest in the world only comparable to Peter luger of New York.

My husband was craving steak and we had always wanted to try CUT at Marina Bay Sands. My husband ordered the steak sampler which comprised of 3 types of cuts and meats while i ordered the lobster. We both shared an appetizer and two sides. At the end of it, we were so full from the food, we had no room for dessert. The experience from breads-appetizer to mains was sensational. You could not fault any of the dishes at all, i couldn't decide which was my favourite! In short, the food is great, the ambience so so. i would not go to CUT if i expected a quiet intimate night out. It is also not a place to go if you are not expecting to shell out at least SGD$200 per person. I know i would most certainly go back again if i was craving steak 
5
Before I review my experience, I want to provide this caveat: if one chooses to dine at an outlet of an acclaimed chef located in a high-rent property, one must allow for a level of price inflation. With that in mind, I will say that my dinner last night exceeded expectations. I'd heard mixed reviews from friends, but it turns out those were unfounded. To start, the atmosphere was beautiful and very well-designed. Not too loud, not too quiet, and the glass cases of bottles of wine provided a nice backdrop.The food was superb. The asparagus, poached egg and bacon vinaigrette starter was mouth-wateringly divine. The main of a NY Strip was a perfectly cooked medium rare (although at 340g, a tad large), and the house-made steak sauce was a nice complement. The potato puree was good and the onion ring tempura was light yet flavourful. One quibble: the first basket of 4 gougieres is complimentary; additional gougieres are charged. How much does it really cost to make a cheese puff pastry?Service here is amongst the best I've had in Singapore (which frankly is quite mediocre), as well it should be at these prices. The team was attentive without being overbearing. Never needed to wait for their response. All in all, I very much enjoyed CUT. It's not someplace I can visit that often, but I will definitely keep it in mind for those special occasions I craving an excellent cut of meat
5
I was dubious about spending so much on steak - but it really is sensational! By far the best steak I have ever had, plus lots of lovely entrees, reasonably priced side dishes, and a delightful chocolate pudding to finish - wish I would afford to eat here every weekend! Hughe choice of wine, and not all at crazy prices which was welcomed
3
Had awesome food. Service really sucked. 30 minutes to get check when leaving, had to ask four times. Waiters slow in taking orders. Put tap water in our sparkling water glasses. Found bristle in my souffle, thought it was human but manager explained it was from kitchen utensil. Still charged me even though I didn't eat it due to what I found!Generally poor service, did tell manager when we left. Hope they improve, the restaurant deserves better.
5
We had the best steak ever as well as the starters and desserts. All of us enjoyed our meals and the service is fantastic. We had Mr Hai who served us at our table and he is entertaining and gave us good tips on the dessert choices which was superb, eventhough we were quite full and wanted to skip the desserts.Cuts served for the steak ranges from 170 gms to 250 gms I think. All our steaks were served charred on the outside but perfectly done inside. The sides orders are great but avoid ordering the fries as they are ordinary. Overall it was a unique and delicious dining experience and we had one of the best meal ever. Our meal costs S$1,500.00 for a party of 5 and we had complimentary drinking water, no wines or other drinks. I can say that it is worth the money spent though we won't be eating there for a while but will certainly be back the next time without our children. The place is pretty noisy when we were there. Anyway we were there for the food so it did not bother us
4
I like the concept of CUT in Marina Bay Sands. It is very elegant and classy. The food is superb. I enjoyed the food presentation. It has a perfect location for tourists who want delicious food created by Master Chefs like Wolfgang Puck. I recommend this to other travelers when visiting Singapore
5
this restaurant is my high light of my trip.- My choice for starter is Bone marrow flank taste like egg tart in Hong kong. - sauce is very powerful hot to my head of wasabi?, mustard.- huge piece of grill Australian beef cover with pepper + etc crust outside. Smooth not too rich of fat of beef slide made me full of it.- service is still high standard, try to entertain me with newspaper, magazine. Many delicious compliment bread. Frequent ask about of food taste.Conclusion:- huge steak please empty your stomach before dinin
2
Don't understand the hype. Food is average at best. If you consider the price, then it is poor. Service is not great at all.
3
Fabulous steaks and great staff but a pricey wine list and shopping mall views nullify the experience.
4
Although some of my friends were unhappy with the prices I thought the food service and prices were ok for an upmarket restaurant and found my steak very nice. I dont think they should have charged us for the water. We were offered still or sparkling and said still and still paid quite a lot
5
We had an amazing evening here at Cut. The steak was absolutely superb, and the service was just brilliant!The design and atmosphere of the restuarant is great and we were fortunate enough that the restaurant manager took us of a tour of the kitchen which was amazing to see the team in action. Highly recommend it

I've been to Singapore many times, and this time I've got a chance to stay in one of the most luxurious casino hotel, Marina Bay Sands. On the first day of the trip, we reserve a table of 5 for experiencing the steak located in the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. That restaurant called CUT by Wolfgang Puck. This restaurant is one of 7 celebrity chefs restaurants, which had been opened for month. The steak was apparently tender and delicious. We order the exclusive Wagyu Steak from Japan, and the taste was as guaranteed by the manager. Moreover there are variety of wine selections from the wine list, which give this one of the most exclusive restaurant in Singapore.Unfortunately the waiter aren't paying much attention on taking care of us at all. Also the manager looks like they don't want to welcome us when we arrive at the restaurant ( although most customer are foreigner and we're Asian ). Anyway the food and wine was great but you may not expect a good service from them though......
5
Three of us decided to splurge and we chose Cut because of its reputation. We ordered the top-of-the-line wagyu steak from Japan. It did not disappoint. The dessert of chocolate mousse is also to die for. Pricey, but u get what u pay for. Service team is also tops in my book
5
We had fillet mignon and sirloin. Both came out perfect with nice crust on the meat. The yukon mashed potato was divine, the cream spinach was smooth and great wine selection. But you may need to check the price on the recommended wine, may cost you up to $50/ glass... but overall is amazing dining experience, with matching amazing price :

On my wife's birthday, she chose to eat at Cut, which we had heard much about. She made the reservation herself. Not having been told otherwise, we brought along an ice cream birthday cake with candles. This was the first shock. Upon requesting a waitress to refrigerate it for us, she said matter of factly that they would not serve it as it was against their restaurant policy. I could not believe my ears. Nowhere in the world have we been refused our birthday cake at a birthday dinner! A senior manager came over and repeated firmly that they could keep the cake for us, but would not serve it, so we could take it home. There was no explanation. I asked to see the most senior person present and the restaurant manager came. I expressed my disappointment and he explained that this was a policy to prevent food poisoning by external food which could then be blamed on the restaurant. Well this wasn't our takeaway hamburger. It was a well frozen ice cream cake. He insisted that anyone who booked a table would be told of this no-outside-food policy. But the fact is my wife was not told. He was conciliatory and did the right thing - he said he would allow the cake this time. That was the right response and we were satisfied. But no more birthday dinners here for us.This place has absolutely the best cheese sticks I have ever had! We kept asking for more which they happily provided. The breads were also varied and fresh, the best being the olive loaf. The appetisers were fine. We had crab meat (pleasant), roast pork (like char siew but salty), and veal tongue (satisfactory but plain). However the kitchen obviously couldn't cope and we were left waiting more than 40 minutes for our mains and we asked the waiters twice to check. Waiting around could have been alright, except that the ambience was not really conducive to conversation. The acoustics were dreadful and with tables packed close together it was a cacophony over which we had to speak very loudly to talk to anyone.We have eaten at both high end and mid-range steak houses in Europe, America and Australia and we know our steaks. For the price range of Cut (anything from $120 to$ 250 a main course), we expected something extraordinary. But all our steaks turned out ot be fair in terms of taste, texture and doneness, but certainly not exceptional compared with offrerings elsewhere. In fact, my wife's Wagyu was so unbelievably tough that she had to call over a waiter to make this known. Then we had our second shock of the evening. Rather than accepting that the steak was too tough, a senior staff member instead offered her a different steak knife to try to cut through it! We were almost too astounded to speak. This could not have happened at a truly high end restaurant. The senior manager was sent for and he did the right thing and immediately offered a replacement steak. My wife (not a complainer usually) was left feeling as if she had not been really believed or was thought to be fussy, something no patron should be subjected to. At the prices asked, perfection is expected and should be delivered.The rest of our steaks were alright. But we found the surface seasoning too salty. And the various sauces offered, although very intereasting and flavourful, were also very salty, making the combination extremely salty.It bears pointing out that it was extraordinary that each sauce (in a tiny ramekin) costs $5!The accompaniments were satisfactory: Onion rings (crispy and light), squash (flavourful), spinach with egg (just how we like it) and a tarte tartin (delicious). All pricey at $18 for what they were, but no complaints about these.One of us had the lobster, which was lovingly shelled and presented with superb truffle butter sauce. This was easily the star dish amongst us, which is ironic considering that this is primarily a steak place.The wines were extortionately priced but the selection was excellent. We didn't have any dessert as we had our ice cream birthday cake, which when they did serve it, was done with style. In fact, I would say that apart from their brusque handling of the cake issue at first, the staff were overall very pleasant, attentive without being intrusive and personable.Overall then: I would like to rate the place on both absolute terms and in relative terms for the price. In absolute terms, it was somewhat above average. In relative terms, the prices could not possibly be justified by the quality and service we had, certainly not my wife's overly tough piece that had to be returned. As top end world's finest steak dining, as it is touted and priced to be, it was definitely a miss. We have had better steaks even in mid-range steak houses in other countries, at a fraction of the price. To be fair, I have heard better reviews from friends, but I am unable to corroborate it from our single experience

Was there during one of the weekends and decided to try the restaurant since Wolfgang Puck is very famous and reputable. From the outside, the restaurant looks very dark but i like it due to the fact the it creates a different atmosphere. I believe that this restaurant is the darkest restaurant that i had visited.The service is very good and professional. Before we even order our food, there is this waitress that showed us the different grades of meat available, using a tray brought to our table. Since i like Wagyu so much, i ordered the 100% Japanese Wagyu (had never tried this grade in Singapore) for myself and my beloved wife. Wife ordered a champagne and i went for a glass of wine. Asked for recommendation from the waiter and he explained his recommendation well. Definitely knows his job. My wife had the bone marrow for starter and i had the pork belly. Both were extremely well done. next came our main course, the "look" of our wagyu were not very nice as its charred outside. Were told that the beef were scorched under a heat of 1200 degrees and thats why the beef looked charred outside. Once i cut up the Wagyu and had a mouthful, the meat is extremely tatsy and soft and tender. Were told that the Wagyu would not need any sauce and its true. Its very tasty on its own. We were very full after that and did not order any desserts.The bill is huge though. All in all, the bill came up to S$881 for the 2 of us. But i guess its really quality meat and the grades of the Wagyu should be above 10 (S$330 per piece, 200 grams).fantastic fine dining experience
5
We had a great meal at CUT - yes it is expensive even for Singapore but the meat is probably the best I have eaten. Yes I have paid less for amazing steaks in NYC, Sydney, Miami and London - but I think this beats the lot. We love a good Rib Eye and ordered the US Prime which is amongst their cheapest cuts ($90 sing), but don't feel compelled to order the $200 Kobe or Wagyu - this was just perfect. Service was excellent if a little over the top at times, but all in all a great meal. We spent about 350 but only had a glass of wine each. If you want an amazing steak and aren't penny pinching I think it's the best in Singapore and possibly the world...
