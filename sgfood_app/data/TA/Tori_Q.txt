I went with my sister and it tastes so good. The best food ever. The food chicken ball is the best. With the rice and seaweed on top of it. It makes me hungry.

Awesome food offered with set meal!
Pricing was relatively pricey but the taste of the food is just simply awesome!
Don't miss giving it a try! And adding $1 for their miso soup would be good! ðŸ˜Š

The food quality is good for a fast food restaurant and there are many variety of skewers you can choose.
5
Always a fan of their bbq snacks! Chicken and egg quail are my favourite. Yummm! You may order rice balls if you are a fan of rice. Soups are available too. But i always opt for bbq only.
5
Though there are many Japanese food restaupant here in Singapore, many restanrant don't have the Japanese taste.
But here is not such, it's completely same as Japnese taste! Exellent!!

Quick cheap place for lunch.
Nothing about service and ambience here.
If you don't consider the cheap price, food quality is poor.

Located in Orchard Gateway you can eat the set of S$6.60 with rice seaweed pickles skewered chic, chic balls.You can also order gyoza at $1.30 for 2pieces and the chic on skewer is only $1.10. With the Q roll at $1.50 you have a complete meal.Drinks are also offered and charged.Ice cold water is complimentary and you can help yourselves.... that is generous of the owner.The counter staff are courteous and friendly.Promotions of its food is ongoing and it is good

For a quick lunch, Tori Q is a Japanese take away food outlet. They prepare and cook the skewers in front of you as you queue for your order. I like the Takashimaya one or even better the one in Ion, there you can seat as in a food court. I love the pork skewers with asparagus, or the pork belly ones or even the Unagi. They are served with Japanese rice, seaweeds and pickles. All of this for 10 dollars or less. They are very tasty

I am a regular at tori q but somehow the queue is always very long ...I like the chicken and pork ball there but now it's not so crispy as before. Price is still reasonable but the Auntie Cashier at bugis branch seem little impatient as I was counting my cash she say " move aside " and let other customer first ...that is is bad and Unfair as it only take a few seconds for me to count my cash and I have queue up for this .Why should I just move aside for their convenient ...it happen even at old Chang kee... I don't feel this is fair and I feel mostly mature ladies had this kind of practised. And also talk in a loud voice even I was used to it but maybe they can tone down a bit., just a suggestion

Tora Q has been one of my favourite place for takeaway whenever I am in Orchard Road. The food is yummy and fast, even if there is a long queue, it will not taken more than 15 mins for your turn. There are a good variety of skewer options - chicken, chicken with green peppers, pork, chicken balls, etc. My favourite choice is always their Set A, it comes with 4 sticks of skewers, rice and some pickles. You can add a bowl of miso soup to your meal. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars (excellent) ratings from me is their price. I used to pay S$5.20 for Set A and the cost has now rises to $6.70 when I last ordered.
5
Mouthwatering! Especially the Asparagus Pork & Pork Belly! To die for. Anyone who loves Yakitori, this is a must visit place. They are all over Singapore.
5
Always love the yakitori here.. From chicken balls to chicken skin.. Always buy to bring back home to Jakarta every time i have a chance to go to Singapore.. If buys more than 10, they gave us 1 tiny bottled of the sauce
4
The set with rice, some pickles, and sticks with meat are really worth the money, I prefer the round chicken balls, sometimes I buy only them. The only item I don't like so much is the miso soup, its too watery.
5
Always go to this place if going to Singapore. I love chicken skin & egg yakitori. The taste so nice combined with soya sauce & quite big portion. Also, fast serving & good price..
5
Just go here! It's awesome. No wonder there are lines every time I come by. Either for take away or dining in, they have customers because the product is real good. No photos available because we dive in as soon as I get my order.
4
Grab a couple of sticks for a quick bite on the go. Love their chicken balls, pork with asparagus. You can have it with rice too.
3
This place provides a quick fix... Fast food type ... Prices are a little higher than your regular fast food... Good when you need a quick bite.
4
If you're suddenly hankering for yakitori or grilled chicken on skewers, this outlet provides takeout for many barbequed chicken on sticks. Each stick costs anywhere between S$1 to slightly over S$2. Not cheap, but good taste does come with price sometimes. We were delighted with all orders: green pepper, asparagus, chicken skin, chicken gyoza and meatballs. Tasty, soft and bite-size. You can even view your orders being cooked in front of you. Definitely satisfied with our first experience in Tori Q
5
It seems that this tiny joint doesn't need much of a review cuz it looks simple, very small, at first I didn't think that I could actually eat there since I usually only buy the skewers to go, but I did and I'm satisfied! Especially the pork!:))Again, there's not much to say except it is a perfect option if you don't really want to spend a lot of time sitting in a restaurant/want something quick but good and filling/too lazy to to figure out what to eat in the busy Orchard.Delicious skewers all around! I wish they didn't close down in Jakarta
4
Tori-Q is a delightful place to stop when you are looking for a quick bite or wholesome snack. The Japanese Yakitori we ordered - pork with asparagus and chicken with green pepper - was both tasty and nutritious. We had it with delicious rice, advertised as "100% pure Japanese rice". For a delicious light meal, try the Tori-Q
4
We ate from Tori Q a fair few times because they are conveniently located in almost every food court. Tasty and good for a bite on the go.
5
Lived in Singapore for a few years and miss this place out of everything
Always great for a quality and tasty meal
Very cheap and just frankly amazing
4
It was a busy day for me and I got a colleague to help pack lunch for me. I had a good Japanese Yakitori dinner last night and was still hankering for something Japanese, so I got this.For my lunch box, my colleague got me these:- Chicken on skewer: 2 sticks- Meat balls: 1 stick of 3.- Deep fried prawn: I feel itâ€™s of the frozen kind, defrosted and deep fried. But it was alright.The staff were a little heavy-handed on the sauce today and the rice was all covered in sauce. The rice is then topped with seaweed, and served with a side of pickled radish.I spent $6.30.All in, itâ€™s a quick and fuss free lunch. I finished it in about 5 minutes
5
Whenever we wanted a quick and delicious lunch, tori-q is the first thing that comes to mind. The long queue does not stop us from eating here. There are a lot of yakitori choices ($1.10+ per stick) and the bento meals (approx. $6.40) can strike the love for this place for those who haven't tried it before. The rice is always hot and drizzled with their special sauce. Recently, they started selling this sauce as well ($5+ per bottle). I guess the broil and grill method does wonders for the skewered meat. I personally prefer the Orchard Gateway branch for the seating space and free iced water.
4
I found this small restaurant by chance. There was a small queue in front of the place, so I popped in to see the goods and found the good-looking chicken, pork, and ball on a stick. I did try a few sticks of chicken and pork, but not a chance to try their bento set. It's quite tasty. I will definitely come back for more when I have a chance to return to Singapore again
5
this. i have to eat tori-q everytime i visit singapore. yes, i know it's japanese. it's the best on the go japanese iive ever had! there is usually a line. the meat is skewered onto a stick. the sticks go through a machine that cooks it. it gets marinated, then cooked again. then grilled over coals, and placed in the window. so, they have all their lil sticks of deliciousness lined up in the window. you choose what you like, if you would like it with/without rice (have it with rice - it's soooo good!).fav flavours: pork and asparagus, chicken, chicken karaag
3
Been here to get food many times over the years. It's usually when i need to quickly grab and go and don't feel like having sandwiches. So Tori is really japanese fast food. And it's got the fast food hallmarks - poorly cooked rice, and overseasoned cheap meats. It tastes ok, but that's probably due to all the teriyaki sauce and MSG they slather over the meat
4
My kids love it as I see many office staffs with ties and moms & paps are waiting in line during lunch and dinner time.Simple, quickly rice and chicky balls or pork or chicky skin satay BBQ. The sauce are tasty and make the satay very delicious and the kids and young old love it.Located in many of the malls but I tried the most popular one in basement of Paragon plaza in Orchard Boulevard
5
It is in fact pretty simple but is a money making machine as the food is very consistent and really very good. The chicken balls and the pork with aspargus are to me the best and their rice comes from Hokkaido. Fantastic value for money and many outlets out there.
4
If you like to have a quick Japanese food; this is the ultimate option for you. They serves different BBQ sticks marinated with teriyaki sauce. Prices are value for money however food and presentation are awesome. I also like the equipment they are using for making dishes
4
I always buy here for takeaways at night. I love how they cook their rice and bbq. I also love the crews they are all jolly and service oriented.
3
If you need a quick japanese lunch or takeaway , this is 1 of the better options. Basically BBQ sticks with teriyaki sauce, you have several options of meats and balls. And one can have rice with them, or just the proteins
5
This is my favourite eating place. They have a few outlets in Paragon, Ngee Ann City, ION... All along the famous shopping Orchard Road. My usual is ION outlet as they have more seating space there.
4
This stall have a fast service.. Taste is good enough. One of my dad favorite food in singapore. We order chicken and pork.
4
On days when I don't want to eat out and want to have quality Japanese food, I will order ToriQ. This store opened recently at Orchard Gateway basement and is close to my office.They have value set meals. I usually order the $6 set which come with rice topped with cut seaweed and 4 sticks of assorted yakitori. If you don't like the set ones, you can order ala carte sticks which are displayed in a glass display and they are freshly grilled.My favorites are their chicken balls and chicken with leek/ green peppers.Good option if you are short of time and need some nourishment on the go
4
I love Yakitori from Tori-Q and my personal favorite is the Tontoro Pork. Tontoro Pork has a good proportion of fat and meat makes it chewy, juicy and it's slightly charred taste combined with teriyaki sauce, YUM!This was the first time I came to the new branch at Orchard Gateway and they have a big sit-in store. The unexpected service was that they provide free flow of water for customers who dine in! I know where to go for a meal next time if I am in Orchard and on a "tight" budget. :
4
I have always enjoyed the simple Yakitori offered by Tori Q. There always seem to be queues at their outlets - especially at the one at Takashimaya.The food quality has been maintained and the process of the meat being roasted is right in from of your eyes !!.Their bento boxes are of great value. However if you just go for the Yaki tori sicks, a meal with about 6 skewers can set you back S$ 10. Their Pork skewers are very tasty as well. Their most premium skewer is the Pork with asparagus at S$ 2.20 a stick.Sometimes if the skewers have been left out for more than 10 minutes, the meat tends to get very chewy, so its best to get fresh ones made especially if you order Chicken Fillet.The place runs efficiently although I wish the staff could generally be have a smile when they are serving. I go to the same place may be 4 times a week, and the same staff are there at checkout - but I have yet to see a smile or a recognition of my regular patronage.I like to write reviews to help others benefit from my experiences. Hope this review was helpful
5
Tori-Q has always been a MUST for me everytime I visit Singapore! At least I had the rice set menu 3 times per visit! Rice was very nice and warm, topped with shredded nori, yakitori sauce, and finally the yakitori itself. Simple meal, yet very satisfactory one. My favorite is the chicken balls, chicken skin, and tontoro pork. A must have
4
Forget McD, KFC, Pizza Hut - it's Tori-Q that ALWAYS is the consensus choice for families for take-aways, because it's so yummy, and cheap. To the assortment of chicken skewers they already have (balls, fillets, skins, wings), they should maximize utilization of the bird by adding chicken cartilage or chicken bones - some of our family members would devour those in a flash
4
This is one of my favorite food in singapore.. My favorites are pork with asparagus and chicken skin. Usually i order their rice with seaweed and pickles.. I love their sauce.. But safly, they don't have table and chairs to sit.. Just a take away counter at takashimaya and ion orchard..So you need to be patient to eat at home..
4
Really yummy BBQ tori n pork
Avoid paragon outlet lots of tourist
Pork neck is best and chicken wings (;
5
A big must! Everything taste excellent especially the chicken skin (taste heavenly)! Though it's a bit expensive for a snack, but it worth the taste! I even went back to orchard to buy another 10 sticks . Remember, 5 is never enough
4
During my stay in SG, this is one of my favorite food. Its a total must every time I go to Orchard, especially their bento. Also, one thing that amaze me is the machine that do all swirls for the chicken skin, very very nice.
5
I love the bento box. Since I was 3 we have been eating here. I love the food and It's just so awseome
5
My cousin told me to eat in this place. The service was really fast and the yakitori is really really delicious! Especially the chicken skins, chicken, chicken karage, the sausages and pork served with rice or can also without rice. The rice has seaweed and some kind of sauces, i love it. The food was cheap but the taste is superb. I will definitely comeback to this place
4
Tori-Q BBQ is sooo yummy!!! It's Japanese style satay with many varieties like chicken skin, chicken balls, etc. Must try whenever you're in Singapore. It is one of my must-eat snacks. My kids love the crispy chicken skin and chicken wings. And I must agree with fellow Tori-Q lovers (@Leslytania), 5 sticks are never enough!
4
Small stalls can be found almost in every shopping mall in Singapore. Serves amazing n delicious Japanese snacks like chicken balls, fried prawn etc on the go. Usually the sticks cost about 1-2 dollars. I love it and I am sure you all will love it too
5
This is my must eat food in Singapore! They don't open in Jakarta so whenever I visited Singapore, I must must must eat Tori-Q bbq. My favorite is the bento with an addition of 2 chicken skin. I already influenced a LOT of people to eat here & all of them said the same thing, the food is excellent! LOVE
5
I love their bar-b-q and their soft rice ;D .. I am not a fan of Japanese food but this one really got me . It is also good for quick bites since they also serve them in on stick ala carte. For me it is kind of expensive but the satisfying taste is all worth it 
3
Japanese food is my all time favorite. I am not a big fan of Yakitori style foodies though, I am eager to try new stuff.This is not a big shop, so I prefer to order take away instead of dining inside. I had ordered one set of assorted Yakitori with rice (SGD 5.9). The Yakitori rolls are really rich in taste. It is nice to try few types of meat in once but not eating too much portion of each. Service is good that the staffs are so friendly and helpful to explain piece by piece. I would definitely consider to return for second try :
5
Succulent chunks of chicken and pork meat on a stick with their delicious sauce. Goes well with rice too. Delicious and great for take aways.
4
Always had good one with this,best yakitori ever ! Can't find like this one in Indonesia.. Always miss their yakitoris ! Everyone who visits singapore must have this yakitori + ricebox :)
4
I just love their crispy chicken skin yakitori, can't get enough of them.
The price is reasonable and it's perfect for lunch on the go.
It's a pity they have closed their outlets in Jakarta.
3
Love TONTORO pork!!!
3
This is basically Japanese fast food, yakitori style. They have sticks of mostly chicken and its derivatives, and others like quail eggs. You can just buy the sticks a la carte, or the bento sets have rice. If you happen to be in the area or mall where it's located and you need a quick bite or snack, it's ok. But then again, why not try local Singapore snacks since one is here? You can find much better Japanese fast food or snacks in Japan.
4
this is the food that you have to try, a little stand from its store, but dont get it wrong, they have great yakitori in town, ive been taste almost their menu, everything was great, their rice was so smooth , tasty, everything was melting on your mouth. the service was pretty quick, they could serve many people on a short time, so we dont have to que any longer. NICE
5
the idea of tori Q - meat of sticks is highly suitable to the singapore palate. No wonder there are always queues at tori-q's throughout singapore. The pricing is reasonable and the quality is always consistent. Wish they had some beef items as well. My favourite is Chicken fillet ....lean and mean :-
5
Ive been back in the states for almost two months now, and along with the crepe carts of Thailand I miss the ToriQ restaurants in Singapore. I Really miss the quail eggs and arabiki sausages. I wish I could open a franchise here just so I could eat there daily like I did in Singapore. I REALLY miss the quail eggs...... so yummy
4
First time I tried this restaurant in Jakarta. Didn't like it. When I went to Singapore this April, my youngest sister told me that Toriq is the best. So, I tried again in Takashimaya's Food Court. And, yes, this is the best yakitori I've ever eat. I don't really like yakitori in any japanese restaurant in Jakarta, but I can say that this is the best :DThe chicken is so tender, specially the ball one :) And the rice is so delicious. I will ask my hubby to try this again next time I go to Takashimaya
5
I tried the one in Takashimaya. Really love it, the rice with seaweed is so good, the yakitori is yummy, no complaints. I can eat this everyday and try all the yakitori and will not be bored. I dont know which one is pork or chicken, though, hahaha.. I like the ball shape, don't know what it is but it was delicious. I will go to Singapore next month and this place is a must to go!
