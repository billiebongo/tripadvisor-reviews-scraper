Always ordered chicken Caesar wrap when I used to visit. Beetroot juice is nice too. Baby pork ribs is one of my friend's fav dish at the place. The dinind experience is great as food is yummy and there is air-conditioning.

using the ipad for ordering is faster however, it doesnt have the review your submitted order. hence, its a bit difficult to ensure our submitted order.

We went to a client place & stop over here for lunches. Nice food, portion is big, reasonable price. I tried the nasi goreng & mee goreng ( 2 different days of course!) beetroot juice & hot mocha Thanks my client for the lunch & bringing us here for the good atmosphere

The cafe is the only choice for a nice sit down gathering with colleagues during lunch time in tuas area. Meals are slightly pricey. Suggest to make some lunch promotion on weekdays so it will be even more affordable and that we will consider patronizing more often instead for only special occasion like farewell lunch. As we came in a group of 10pax, the wait for food to be served is rather long.

The food is good with a very wide choice and the dining area is airy and clean. the loyalty discounts are decent, but when it gets busy the service is shockingly slow. They have far more tables than the kitchen and wait staff can serve. So a 60 min plus wait for your food and then a 15 min queue to pay is what happens. Not really acceptable when people are have at most 1 hr for lunch break

Decent for a quick bite and a break from the hawker food options in the area. Smart place and a modern feel with iPads for ordering etc. Food is good, not great but what is the real negetive is it all seems to get sent whenever it is ready instead of together for everyone at the table so you end up eating at different times.
