It was after business hour dinner on Friday night, recommended by colleagues to Comr here for a casual dinner. The resturant is a Taiwanese food resturant that serve Japanese beer and style of portion. It is near the heritage alley within the Far East square. Nice cosy benches suitable for group dinner. We are the few non Japanese crowd in the resturant. It seems to be a very popular place for Japanese hang out. The menus are written in Japanese, chinese and English so we don't worry about ordering. Waitresses are mainly chinese. I personally like the Taiwanese noodles fried with bitter gourd and the Fried sambal morning glory leaves ( kang kong which singaporean called it locally). We wanted to order the second serving and it ran out. Recommend for casual business dining but not family dinning on the Friday night as the bars outside is too noisy and rowdy.

If you visit the restaurant before 12 noon, you will definitely have a table. Seats fill up fast after the noon. Services are impeccable. Food is tasty, not the unforgettable type. It is a fusion of Taiwanese and Japanese style and flavour. Price wise, it is a tad expensive given that it cost us $35 for 2 set lunches (1 course for each person).
