Convenient mainstream hawker food at this a/c food court. Prices start at $4. Tastes decent, not spectacular. As is the case for all food courts, few empty seats at feeding time.

Dropped by for a quick breakfast after my healthscreen. A regular foodcourt apart from the fact that it's in a hospital, so there are signs everywhere about healthy eating, and each stall has a traffic light indicator (green, amber, red) about dish selection

Pretty convenient "makan" (local speak for dining) place, has lots of local fare to offer, and a small bakery with tasty coffee- flavored bread.

We tried the chicken rice and seafood fried rice during lunch. Not too shabby considering the selection. A crowded place and seating is limited for a typical food court setting. Be sure to come early and beat the crowd.

This is the most mediocre food court I have ever been to. Offering halal versions of Chinese food is fine but the quality of the dishes is terrible. The wantan noodles I ordered were lumpy and stuck together.

The food court is quiet on a weekend with lots of seats especially for groups. Like the Indian Cuisines for it fresh foods especially Tandoori Chicken with Biryani and many selection of vegetables. During weekdays which is busy during lunch hours, Tandoori Roti is available a very healthy bread and on weekend Chapati. My wife had fish curry sets which was fresh and include a small sweet dessert

We spent a lot of time in NUH as a family member was admitted to the Kent Ridge Ward. this is a great place to eat. Although the Main Buildings Kopitiam has more options and is open longer the queues here are shorter and the food equally good. I had the Kaya toast and eggs for breakfast, and the Butter Chicken and Prata from the Indian stall. The Tom Yum Fried rice was also very good. The stalls close very early so you must get there before 8:30 p.m.

On the Ridge is one of the latest concept food court by Kopitiam. It is located at the 5th level of the One@KentRidge mall inside the new National University Hospital Medical Centre at South Buona Vista. It is accessible via the Kent Ridge MRT Station (Circle Line).There are a lot of food stalls to choose from, in addition to the old vendors from the "Healthy" Kopitiam that was closed down. Try the no-fuss fried chicken from the Western Food or the Salad Bar next to it. There's also an Indian dessert stall. There's always a long queue at the Indonesian Penyet stall.Get a seat with a good view
