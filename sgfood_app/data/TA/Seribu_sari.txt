Nothing that wows me over but nice food nonetheless.
Main dish was soto betawi & mee bakso. Kueh2 were just average. I had expected more variety as indonesia has very nice kueh.
Atmosphere is fine.

Great restaurant in every thing, atmosphere, staff and the taste. Also, if you are a guest in Rendevzous Hotel yoo will get 20% discount.
We dine there two times and it was so great.

Literally meaning "land of a thousand spices", this restaurant is located at the site of the former Rendezvous eatery, which has moved to Clarke Quay. A little pricier than most, the food here is simply fabulous and the chefs have managed to blend the various spices into culinary delights. We had the tahu telor (well presented but could have done with a little more bean sprouts), satays, beef rendang (the best dish that night), curry fish and sambal brinjal. If you are a durian fan, you can order the durian pengat or chendol with durian - both are really very good, though a little expensive at round $10 each. The sago and gula melaka was also delicious. There were eleven of us at dinner and all thoroughly enjoyed the food
