Very nice restaurant on riverfront. Seafood is very good, cooked properly and portions are big, especially rice and noodles. Drinks are a little bit expensive. Ask for a table by the riverfront and enjoy the dinner

We were with a group of friends there for a birthday dinner on our last visit to Singapore back in June 2013 and the service and food was fantastic. However this time (August 2015) the restaurant was closed. whether that was for maintenance or it has closed up I'm not sure?

Lovely ambience to dine alfresco at this spot. Very comfortable setting, attentive staff and delicious food. If you don't mind the prices, this is a great option to enjoy some river view activities and the cool breeze in the evening outdoors. We ordered the asparagus in cran sauce, minced chicken patties, pomelo salad, red curry and rice.

The setting and ambience are perfect. In the middle of things, yet quiet enough to relax. Vistas from all tables on the canal and buildings with boats going by, just beautiful.Food and wine selection great both in terms of variety and price.I particularly like the very authentic choice between the very unique SoutEast Asian cuisines on offer.Service is great an friendly , so for a good night on the Quay for dinner, this is the place to g

We found it hard to find a quiet restaurant at Clarke Quay, especially one without lots of smokers and no extremely loud music blaring. But IndoChine ticked all the boxes and was a nice intimate, inviting restaurant.We weren't overly hungry so decided to share a tasting platter of little bites and pieces, some seafood, duck and vegetable.It was all delicious, with lovely dipping sauces and sambals that all went really well together.The platter was more than enough for the two of us to share ( we had a big lunch in China town)I wish I was hungry as I would have loved to try some of the interesting mains on the menu

Having been to the restaurant at the waterfront,the expectations were quite high.Having said that the assorted platter of finger foods was very fresh and full of flavour. The drinks were overpriced and the service left a lot to be desired. Each time we needed to get the attention of the service staff we had to crane our necks forever to get someone's attention. Could give it a miss and visit other similar restaurants in the area

Attractive spot next to the river and quieter and less heaving than a lot of the neighbouring establishments. Food was good - spring rolls, a pork stir fry and a green papaya salad. Service was fine.But the cost of drinks, like apparently most places in Singapore, is ferocious - S$17 for a pint of Heineken, similar cost for a glass of wine. Also, all of the many riverside terraces of eateries along Singapore's Clarke Quay and similar Boat Quay have rather hopeless little fans that don't do much to keep the temperature down. They should investigate the excellent cold mist fans that feature for example in summer on Budapest's Liszt Ferenc tér

Was attracted by the good range of veggie options on the menu. Service was mixed, the young woman who first guided me to my table was great, the guy that took my order less so and gave me the impression that customers were an inconvenience. First shock was the drinks prices. I know Singapore is expensive for beer etc compared to the Uk, but it worked out at about £8 for a pint of Heineken. Foodwise, I went for a tofu dish in the 'Indo-chine' sauce whatever that is supposed to mean (as while the tofu was very nicely cooked, along with a few bits of onion and pepper, it was pretty tasteless). You have to order rice separately. I was billed for 'jasmine rice', so I'll just have to take their word for that as it looked and tasted like plain steamed rice to me. Nice location, but I feel we pay more for the location than either that or the restaurant experience is worth

The location is great right on the water. The food is good, the service is okay bit drinks a bit expensive.

Nice ambiance. Good food and friendly staff. Their place will make you feel like your in a different part of the world. Nice to have a dinner outside.

Good Asian food dining at an outdoor table on the river. Tried some different dishes and all very good. We thought the prices were very reasonable for the setting and experience. Lots of competition in Clarke Quay but would eat here again.

Food and service was good. Location perfect for a weekend dinner. Need to improve staff training on customer service.

This restaurant is one of my favs. The food is descent, but what I like most about it is the atmosphere. Dark and mysterious.

The Menu is really good you can just about order anything and it is going to be good, Must try is the Duck Salad / shredded chicken in rice wrap and Red Thai Curry / Chicken in Basil. Location is very good , staff is ok and don't be surprised if you are treated like a tourist

Booked the table for 5 outside for a relaxing evening with some colleagues from overseas. Quite busy for a Wednesday night which is always a good sign but service was truly excellent, the staff were knowledgeable of the menu , helpful and attentive. Following a round of drinks and with an extensive menu we asked the waiter to recommend starters. Two beautiful platters of a mixture of seafoods, including mouthwatering prawns coated in sesame seeds which was something new for me, and delicious. My mouth is watering now as I write. We asked him to do the same for the main course and we all shared soft shell crab, wonderfully tender beef and and some other great dishes including fresh vegetables. A great place to go for a business dinner or a family meal or probably a romantic dinner for two by the river, I saw all three while I was there. Try the place out, and if you can't eat outside there are all sorts of options inside too. Will be back for sure.....

Among the many tourist traps on Clarke Quai this has always been a good choice. Excellent fusion food from several South-Asian countries (former restaurant name Indochine), served at reasonable prices right on the river banks. The staff is very friendly and attentive. This company operates several restaurants in Singapore, ewual quality and hifgly recommended, and even one in Hamburg, Germany, named Indochine, another one of my favourites and also on the banks of a river, in this case Elbe river

I bumped into this establishment while looking for another club.the outdoor area is laid back and on a friday there is a dj playing rnb.i like the laid back unpretentious vibe.only fault is I tasted the worst mango daiquiri I have ever had in my life.the cocktails start from $16 which is good for singapor

Indochine is a chain...one near Boat quay..this one in Clark quay etc.. We always get a table pretty much next to the river at this location...it so adds to the whole experience.Worth booking in advance though .Food is always pretty good here....Best to stick to Asian cuisine and fish.The wines here aren't bad value for money in comparison to Singapore prices.Great place to eat before you dive into Clark quay nightlife
