Your Italian Butler was introduced by a friend of mine.Visited them a total of 3 times between March and April, 2 weeks apart, with a different friend.1st time ordered the 7-course with free flow wine.2nd time ordered the 9-course with free flow wine. (Pictures provided were from the 9-course)3rd time ordered the 11-course with free flow wine.At the end of each dinner, we left the place smiling, happy on good wine (not drunk), high on great food and not a hole in the pocket.The restaurant owners were friendly and always in a jovial mood. Though they didn't exhibit the same friendliness to their staff.Heard from one of the staff that other than 1 of the service staff is a regular, they always use part-timers to fill the place hence the part-timers are never the same. On one of my visits, that story turned out to be true when a part-timer was sent back after just working an hour into the job because she spilled wine onto the customer's bag and another part timer appeared to replace her in a the next hour.On the food, for all 3 dinner sets, the appetizers (1st & 2nd dishes) are the same - a bread, cheese and ham platter with salad. I recommend that you eat each of them individually first to get a taste. Then mix and match them together in groups of 2, 3 and finally 4 (all ingredients together) For those who enjoys dipping their bread into a blend of balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, please do so after trying the mixing & matching. On my 1st visit, the owner gave us each a goblet of Chimay to go with the platter.I will be describing the 9-course omakase from this point one to link up with the photos attached.The 3rd and 4th dishes were BBQ Pork Ribs and Pork Crackling. The BBQ Pork Ribs or Pork on the Grill (Carne di Maiale alla Griglia) are roasted with a Tuscan sauce coated onto of the pork baby back ribs. The meat was off the bone well done with the Tuscan flavours nicely sealed into the meat.The Pork Crackling had a crispy top and a soft, moist meat that is full of flavours.For this dish, we requested for a full bodied red wine to wash down the flavours. (Unfortunately, I have forgotten the name of the wines that was served to us.)For the 5th dish, it was the Pan Fried Dory Fillet with Mediterranean Tomato Sauce. The fish was crispy on the skin and tender on the flesh. The tomato sauce added more tanginess to the dish. We requested for a drier white to go with this dish. For the 6th dish, it was the Tuscan-Style Grilled Quail. The quail was nicely done and evenly cooked. (Had an experience where the quail was well-done on the outside and reddish-ly uncooked on the inside resulting the dish being sent back) We asked about the pink dots on the side but couldn't make out the whole word the owner was saying other than mustard. The overall taste was pleasant. The owner saw our dish, came over with new glasses and a bottle of white to propose that we switch over the wine for this dish. The tasting experience got elevated with the wine where the hints of berries and spices from the wine became more pronounced and making us savour every bite of the quail and sip of wine.The 7th Dish was Tagliatelle with Tomato and Basil. Other than the tagliatelle and the pomodoro sauce being handmade, the dish was considered light to the palate, especially after the quail and wine combination just before this dish. Since the omakase comes with free flow wine, we requested for a red and white to go with this dish and the owner obliged happily. The dish goes well with both the red and white wines provided.The final 2 dishes, 8th and 9th, were Tiramisu and a Strawberry Sorbet. The tiramisu was soft and light with a nice Kahlúa finishing at the back. The strawberry sorbet was satisfyingly refreshing.After our meal, the owner asked if we would like coffee, Since we are in an Italian restaurant, it wouldn't be complete without a cup of Italian coffee. Ordered 2 Cappuccinos.We continued to drinking and chatting till late in the restaurant. Considering that the restaurant was packed, I was surprised that they didn't ask us to leave for new customers to come in. All the time, the owners kept topping up our wine glasses and providing details on each of the wine he was pouring in. At one point, when we wanted to settle our bill to leave for the night, one of the owner came out from behind the counter with another bottle of red wine and told us to try this wine. He said it is his personal collection and favourite. So we sat back down to continue to drinking. All these happened till the restaurant was about to close. We were there from 7pm to 1130pm. It was an absolutely amazing experience hence I returned 2 other times with a different friend. From my 3 visits, my friends praised the food, loved the dining experience and enjoyed the conversations we had. Do take note that Your Italian Butler is no longer at Mosque Street in Chinatown as mentioned on this page. They have shifted over to Dunlop Street in Little India area. Do check their respective partners like Chope or HungryGoWhere for their address

After walking by and seeing the great prices and friendly owner, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. What a great find. From the food/wine to the service/atmosphere, everything was perfect. We got there between 12pm and 7pm when there is buy one get one for all food and drink items. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Singapore

The staff at this restaurant were super friendly, making for a very warm and cozy atmosphere. The owner was previously a professional butler, so he tries to bring that service ethos to how he manages the restaurant. He allows patrons to customize their dining experience based on budget and culinary preferences. I enjoyed my time there and would definitely go back.

Upon a friend's recommendation, we sampled "Chef's Selection 5"; this corresponds to a five-course tasting menu (110SGD++ for two persons). We also ordered a bottle of wine which, at 49SGD++, is a steal. The portions are not big at all; however, the food and wine pairing was a good experience. Will return

Your Italian Butler, Located at 7 Dunlop Street, It’s not easy to find restaurants offering pure spread of authentic European dishes. Well let’s not look any further Your Italian Butler is the place. All dishes are served to the table were delicious appetizers, scrumptious and of course sinful desserts, Would highly recommend Your Italian Butler to any-one who enjoys great Italian food & hospitality at fantastic value.. Staff were attentive, professional and friendly, absolutely faultless.Anyhow the food was delicious. Some of the tastiest Italian food I've eaten in SGP. The prices are definitely high, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. However with such an exquisite experience we are looking forward to going back soon

The restaurant was accommodating and welcoming that we arrived 1 1/2 hour earlier than our 6.45pm booking. However, the aircon was not turned on till 6.30pm. Although they claim the menu is customized, we noticed that subsequent customers receiving the same meal. We informed that we don't eat chocolate and they continued to serve desert Chocolate Gelato and Tiramisu, both containing chocolate. What we are unhappy about is the next table bargained with them and their wine was on the house whereas our drink was part of the 7 course meal. Note to other customer, go for the 5 or 6 course meal as the 7 course was too much even for a big eater like my husband. Despite all these, food was delicious. A good once off experience

We had ordered 2 7-course (68++)and 2 9-couprse (78++) meal as suggested by the boss. However, we were only served 4 7-course meal. We checked with the staff and he brushed us off by saying that the appetiser was considered as 2-course and the dessert of 1 tiny scoop of ice cream & 1 tiny 2cmby2cm cake is considered as 2-course. We felt a little cheated and disappointed as we were not informed when we ordered or when the appetiser and desserr were served. Servings were small. Pork was nicely braised. Other dishes were just so so. Beef was overcooked and dry. Food quality was overpriced.Probably worth gg for the lunch set (38+)with 1for1 offer. But definitely not worth going for dinner

We had heard about the restaurant from colleagues - and we were not disappointed. The rabbit in particular was very good.

I'm willing to believe the glowing reviews of the dine-in customers but this place is also on foodpanda (under the name "Butler Italian" but with a blurb that identifies them as "Your Italian Butler") and the food that they delivered was cafeteria Italian. A carbonara that was heavy on the cream and drowned in cheese, bruschetta that was ok I guess, and tiramisu that did have a heavy serving of alcohol but was otherwise very fluffy and weak and just what you'd expect from a cafeteria. It was cheap, but nothing more than you'd expect from the price

We enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu immensely - could not decide if rabbit or pasta with truffles was our favourite, and that is saying something, as one of the courses was perfect waguye beef, only running for third favourite course. High quality ingredients perfectly prepared - and different every day, we were told. Will definitely be back to try again

The 7 course was surprising and very delicious! The meat dishes were melting in my mouth! Must try! The interior was romantic and gorgeous! It feels like I went to a special boutique italian restaurant! One of the best restaurant that I have went to. If you had tried The old Dozo and the Clan restaurant and loved them, you should really try this restaurant! I would definitely come again

Had a 7 course omakase dinner (promotion 62++ ) to celebrate my boy's birthday. We had a good time from start to end. Excellent Food. So fresh and so well prepared. Not too salty , not too oily. Everything was just right. The fun was we didn't quite know what to expect and each time the food came, we gave a wow, especially for the baked fish which was huge and so so fresh. We were served porketta, lamb chops, beef steak and baked fish for the meats. And seafood pasta. Very attentive service. Funny people there too. Free flow good white and red wine for this promotion. Birthday boy had an on the house glass of pomegranate juice and a piece of birthday cake. Although the place was small , it was cozy and pleasant. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

The interesting thing about the menu is that...there is no menu.You simply tell the waiter:a) how hungry you are (choose how many servings you want, price depends on how many you take),b) what you do NOT like (for me it is cucumber and rucola)and then you are surprised with what the chef has decided to prepare for you: but you never go wrong, it is a most delicious and authentic italian food.I shall certainly return

It’s said that when it comes to food, Italians swear by nothing but their mother’s cooking, so “home-cooked” takes on a completely different meaning for these folks. This stalwart of the casual Italian dining scene in Singapore has taken home-cooked to the next level, dispensing with menus and opting for a more customised, “omakase” style Italian meal. All for the best, because those fussy Italian menus can often be pretty intimidating. Put the courses and flavour pairings in the capable hands of the chef.Here, give the convivial team a rough sense of your budget, preferences, and cravings, and the kitchen will whip up a feast based on what’s fresh in the kitchen and in the chef’s imagination. Everything, from the pasta to the artisanal breads, is made in-house, and the flavours on offer here draw from the diverse regions of Italy, some 20 in all, served over a luxurious multi-course meal.Prepared à la minute, the food, whether it’s the day’s freshest handmade pasta in a sauce of seasonal vegetables and meats, or a crusty grilled fish, freshest of the lot, arrives piping hot at the table faster than you can say “aperitivo”. It’s like having your own personal kitchen whip up Italian classics to the rhythm of your appetite
