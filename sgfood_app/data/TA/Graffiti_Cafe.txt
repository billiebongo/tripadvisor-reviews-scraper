We were staying at the Hyatt next door and we ate here a couple of times, soup both time and the lime juice because it was just so tasty and great value for money - highly recommended.

I like the latte served with cheesecake and muffins. The cafe is clean and service is good for value of money

This seemed to be franchise and the one at Far east looks to be their flagship outlet. Everyone goes for the fried wantans but ironically for me, I like it in the soup. The noodles are done well. not soggy. Ask for the black sauce with chilli, and less tomato sauce- yummy
