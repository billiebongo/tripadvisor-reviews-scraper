The food are good, although sometime the meat were a bit over cooked.The price is reasonable. Especially the mixed sashimi , the oysters. Good selection of sakes,always have sakes promotion , like 2 for the price of 1.
Overall is still fine. Service is good.

The restaurant provide set lunch on weekdays. The salad taste not bad but the main is not my cup of tea. Tried twice this restaurant and I don't think I will go back to try the 3rd time.

Nice bright interior. Tried their skewers. Unfortunately most were overcooked, like the beef, pork and offals. Good selection of sakes. Reservations could be better handled. Overall an alright experience.

This place is easy to find and has a good environment. The waiters are friendly. As for the food, yummy yummy yummy. I love the oyster as well as the avocadoes dish. Take a look at our sumptuous lunch.

Excellent lunch formula. Savoury dish @ attractive price. Fancy location on a nice peaceful terrace above a buzzing shopping center.

The restaurant name conjures up an imagery of fiery-flame dancing, which aptly describes the straw-fueled natural method of grilling its meat. My friend and I ordered two set lunches: Tori Teriyaki Set and Salmon Ikura Set to try out the food. All lunch sets (irrespective of their pricing) came with miso soup, salad, pickles and a big bowl-full of steamed white-rice. The green-teas were charged at nominal prices.We enjoyed the food and the izakaya ambience. Staff who attended to us were sociable and helpful with food suggesions. We had their fullest attention as there was no crowd at that hour. Very comfortable and pleasant experience indeed

After more than 10 visits to this modern Japanese restaurant perched at the rooftop of Suntec City, I'm still looking forward to it each time. The specialty here is the straw flame yakitori but I very much prefer the other items on the menu. For sushi and sashimi lovers, there ain't much for you to explore here but you can find a long list of exciting cooked food. The tori karage is superb, I was smitten by it and never forget to include it on every visit. Besides that, steamed tofu is serve as a premium version to other places and I rather you discover the real stuff yourself. You can also find fusion salads with interesting combination. No Japanese dinner is completed without alcohol and you really need to try their highball whisky with soda from the tap. Light and refreshing, you can go on and on until your sobriety is compromised. This is a place where good service complements good quality of food, setting up a perfect place to mingle with friends

Lovely location - Right in Suntec City but in the 3rd floor Sky Garden with lots of surrounding greenery. A limited lunch menu but everything we ordered was very good. My favourite was the meat patty and half boiled egg set. All the sets came with salad and miso soup. The aburi salmon sushi, atsuge tofu and tamago were excellent. The fried chicken karaage came with a most delicious mayo sauce.
