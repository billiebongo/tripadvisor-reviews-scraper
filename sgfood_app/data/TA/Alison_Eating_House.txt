This review is for tourists who are strolling along Orchard road and looking for good cheap local food. Alison Eating House is located at the 2nd floor of Lucky Plaza. You know the food is good because you will only see locals eating at the place. Try their roast duck noodles or roast pork and char siew rice. Their wanton soup is also great with plump luscious dumplings. They have a good collection of desserts as well. This place was recommended to me by a Singaporean friend and I have been a regular customer every time I am in Singapore.Expect to spend about S$5+ for a meal which includes dessert.

On the 2nd level of Lucky plaza above the food court you will want to savour the Cantonese roast meat of char siew, pork belly and roasted duck with rice or wanton mee. I opt for the latter without the sauce but just soy sauce and abit of its flavourful sauce. The noodles were springy and firm and I enjoy it even without chilli .... the skill of the chef can be experienced with every gulp ..... yummy .... Tor chaey (Cantonese dialet in the ethnic Chinese group) .... tq for such wonderful enjoyment. We chose the roasted drumstick to complement our noodles and didnt regret our choice.After a delicious meal you can order hot and cold desserts of your choice ... choice is endless with red, green bean, bobo char char (yam sweet potato coloured tapioca starch sago and coconut milk) cheng teng, tua suan from $1.80- $2.00 all these are our local desserts worth a try especially for patrons with a sweet tooth.Our satisfying lunch amounted to S$18.90 for 3 with 3 drumsticks in the expensive shopping hub of Spore's Orchard road .... our Oxford street of London.Before or after your meal Ion, Wisma Atria and Takashimaya departmental stalls are opposite

It is a must for family to stop there to dine there every time we come to SG. To get very good local food with reasonable price easily, this is the right place to go. We love the wonton dumpling soup, charsiauw noodle , Chick rice, duck noodle , ice chentgeng, Ice kachang, everything is so good there. I can get their meal several times in even less than a week visit to SG. Uncle Tay n family, the owner, and staffs ate very friendly

We happened by here one day while looking for breakfast. It's hard to find a reasonably priced place to eat on Orchard St. in Singapore. This place is on the second floor in Lucky Plaza on Orchard St. You can get some really good, fresh made dishes with drinks, many for under 5 Singapore Dollars. We ended up going by there a couple times the week we stayed in Singapore. I especially like the chicken rice for breakfast
