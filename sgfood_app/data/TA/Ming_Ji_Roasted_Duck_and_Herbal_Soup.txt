I used to frequent this hawker center store in the 1990s. It was really good. After a long period of absence, went back two days ago & was hoping to experience the nostalgic taste of Ming Ji's duck rice. To my disappointment, the standard has dropped. The rice was hard and the meat was stiff. If this is it's new standard, I doubt it will be able to survive the keen competition at Whampoa hawker center. Other popular stores, eg. the Hoover, are still excellent
