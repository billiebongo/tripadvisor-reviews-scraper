Across the road from my hotel, this was a convenient, clean, inexpensive place to eat. There was a large comprehensive menu from which to choose, service was good and the ambience pleasant.

Stumbled on this gem on a balmy Saturday night. This has a glass wall kitchen so you can watch the chefs in action. If you like dim sum and alike meals this is a great place to eat. Our family had about 5 baskets of different dumplings and duck spring rolls, fried rice, beef with black bean and dumpling soup. All were of a very good quality and made it to our table all at once in record time. With drinks only cost sgd <$80! The service was excellent. Highly recommend

I have been staying in The Sultan, the boutique hotel opposite, for the last 2 weeks and kept meaning to try Noodlestar. Now I regret not coming here sooner. Normally I like the stalls food around the corner - cheap and reasonable quality but I have just had a meal for twice the price (Sing$ 15 Inc coke) but 3 or 4 times better quality. The dumpling soup was delicately flavoured with plenty of perfectly cooked plump dumplings and crisp fresh broccoli stems. The noodles with beef were superb and with a touch of their excellent chilli sambal made my day. I really cannot recommend this place enough. Spotlessly clean with very friendly and attentive service. I have paid more in Singapore for a lot less. DO NOT MISS if you like simple Chinese food

Really enjoyed the food here, the place itself is a little sterile and doesn't have much atmosphere but it makes up for that in efficiency and speed of service. I ate here twice and it has a very good selection of regional food, I would have returned but wanted to try other places as well, this is a high quality place and visitors will not be disappointed. Dishes were very tasty and well presented, and I get value for money was good, not the cheapest place around but the quality is high.Did not dislike anything about it at all.

Food is good, was nice to eat some actual beef after time in Sri Lanka. My gf had the dumpling soup and we shared Chinese pancake rolls which were good but a bit oily. $25 was not bad overall for that and a couple of Chinese teas. Service was good

This was an amazing place where they would do hand pulled noodles fresh at the spot. Suddenly the management decides to stop doing it and then start using ready made noodles which for SURE can't compare. They just threw away their main differential as besides that the food is just normal with a high price tag for what it is. They now tried a new menu but again miss the mark with just normal food making it not good value for money. Servers are quite attentive and really try to give a good service
