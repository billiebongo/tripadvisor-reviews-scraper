If you are going here to eat a la carte and have a drink.
Go and do it at the 2nd floor sports bar attached to Restaurant on ground floor.

we had Buffett. Good choices for vegetarians.We were party of 12 people.Service was good.Just a block from our hotel.Gave us discount because we were with a tour .
4
We were taken here by our tour manager. The staff was very efficent in managing the crowd. The food was tasty, compared to other indian restaurants in Singapore. The group especially enjoyed the mutton kheema.
Certainly a place to come back again
4
Food was good & Spicy, it is a Indian restaurent , all Indian food .little bit expensive. staff were good .we eat Husband wife 2 son 5 & 7 yrs. total Bill 68SGD

Called in for a light lunch while visiting Little India. We were seated quickly and near an airconditioner, which was very welcome! Service was good and food arrived quickly. Very tasty with nice amount of spice. Would recommend a visit. Restaurant was very busy
4
The food is good and the quality is very nice. Only thing is the workers need to wait for a while so that people can eat, they must avoid rushing
5
In case you want to have Indian food in Singapore you shouldn’t miss this restaurant. Good ambience. Quick service and good quality what else do you need in a restaurant. Reasonably priced
4
Thanks Sitara for providing us the great tasting, authentic and vegetarian north Indian food while we were craving for same in Singapore!

Went there after few years and now both quality and service has declined.The waiter while taking order did not take note and even when I asked, Are you sure you can remember all our order?He was overconfident and missed few of the items. The Veg Pakora was horrible and half cooked. When we complained then they simply double fried it. The Gobhi Manchurian was tasteless and Rogan Josh average. We ordered at 640pm and these guys did not tel is that there is a buffet starting at 7pm which had almost same dishes what we ordered and costed around 22.5$ only.Cleanliness was not so good and service below average. Till 8pm there were no customers except us even though it was weekend.Avoid it

This is a very good restaurant almost the opposite side of Mustafa Market. Food quality is really very good. Though you can get here mainly North Indian food, but they have a lot of options. So you can choose as per your requirements. The restaurant guys are also very nice and helpful. Even if you have any difficulties regarding any food, they will assist you to get the best one for you. That is what they did for my mother. Another nice thing is if you are touring Singapore with Luxury Tours & Travels then they will provide you 20% extra discount

Went to this restaurant for lunch ...had buffet there ...good for veg people ...chapati and dal was nice ... food was also ok... service was good and well attended ...has wide options for food and desserts... halwa was also nice ...
3
Had lunch in this restaurant after a hectic morning of sight seeing. Went for the buffet. Nothing extraordinary but honest Indian food. and all for 30 SGD. Overall a value for money place & well located.
4
Good Indian restaurant but due to it's location on main road at peak hours there's heavy rush Lot of travel agencies are behind this building They can also provide you 8 seater car if you need
4
It was next to our hotel and providing 20% discount to guest staying in our hotel. We had dinner couple of times and it was good. Price was reasonable.
4
The Indian cuisine in here is excellent.We went there to have lunch.The food was very delicious and our whole family enjoyed it.The location is also very convenient as it's just in the middle of Little India. Probably one of the best Indian cuisine I've ever tasted.The rice pudding we had for the dessert was also good.The staff was very friendly. Would surely visit again
4
We stopped for lunch, and were in short of time. The restaurant is/will be always full. One of the staff members was very helpful. He got spicy hot biriyani and curd rice for us and it was really awesome. Very nice location. Want to taste indian/home food,,, then it is a must visit one,,, do not miss it, when you are in singapore,,
4
we stumbled up on this restraunt in between our tour. it had been a while and was slightly craving the indian food. we got in and i ordered the hyderbadi biriyani. it was finger licking awesome. its a total try if your arround. the buffet is not worth it. but i like their wastage policy to pay extra if u waste the food. that was catchy. staff was very welcoming. over all a good place but not fancy. and its in little india
2
We arrived at the hotel around 10PM. We were asked to wait outside due to shortage of space. Then one staff told us, " Why you are waiting outside? The restaurant will close in few minutes". Our dinner was part of a package. They provided us only the buffet. The toilet was very dirty (not expected in Singapore at least). Food was cold. They did not provide fresh roti/ nan also. Since their business is guaranteed through travel agents they do not provide service
5
Decent north indian food. Buffet lunch and dinner are value for money and must be preferred to a la carte. One of the old indian restaurants. Live bollywood music after 9 pm as per management though not seen personally. Ideally located just next to farrer park mrt. Overall not a bad place worth a try. Staff is courteous.
3
It is sure that they mean business and nothing above it. This restaurant has good location and area is common hangout place. Many Indians seen around this place. The manager lady or the owner was very rude with not even welcome expression on her face. She just wanted to get rid of the groups that she meant to finish.  Food was nothing more than average.. sooji halwa was below average. These people should learn hospitality as person coming here are not beggars and pay them handsome amounts to serve. At least behave well to your customers. Bathrooms have poor hygiene unclean washbasin. Outside this hotel the sitting area is good atleast to wait till previous group has done. Needs improvement at all fronts
4
The restaurant is in little India taste is as good as Indian nice location and fantastic food. Medium spicy can try buffet
3
Food quality is just OK. We had the buffet dinner. Retail price for buffet is SGD 22. Which i feel is overcharging. Maybe ala-carte is better quality. Location is great. Bang opposite mustafa shopping centre.
4
Located next to claremont hotel, opposite mustafa, supposed to be a frequented by Indian tourists by the hordes.
Good food, seems to be affordable for a restaurat
1
It was very pathetic and non sense behaviour by restaurant staff during our special request food and totally worst behaviour ...! Typical old generation ...!
Near by this restaurant we really feel good ambiance and food at Kamala'S vegetarian
5
i hv been in singapore for 1 week... every day i had my dinner at Sitara only......... Excellent... Food and service both.........
2
Food 5/5 yummy, we all loved it. Service 4/5 can't complaint. It's ok.Clean/ hygienic 2/5 dirty plates, marks on glasses, damaged old cutlery (fork pic attached) , my beer coaster was probably used a million times with curry and dirty marks on it, I would rather not have a coaster then a filthy one. I am sure tiger singapore will be happy to send you a box of free coasters every month. (Coaster pic attached)Toilets 1/5 They probably don't care as location is good and business is doing well
1
We a group of 30 ppl visited in last week of March. Our travell agency arrnaged dinner here for us. It was unhygienic and low quality food, coz of this half of our group members suffer with stomach aches with diarrhoea. No proper service was there. So avoid this restaurant
5
We were on a trip to Malaysia and Singapore exploring their cultural foods and at a point, we came across this restaurant in Little India , Singapore. Since it had been days we have had any Indian food, we thought of trying this one with a slight hesitation that Indian food might not be that great in other countries. We choose the buffet of $19 (we got it at a discounted rate of $14.5, thanks to our Travel agency (Luxury Tours and Travel)) and to our surprise, the food was so great, so delicious that I hadn't had this much good food in years. The menu had Soup,Papad, Pakode, White Rice, Pulao, Daal, Malai Panner Sabzi, Mix Veg Sabzi, Methi Chicken sabzi, Mutton Kheema, Dhai(Curd) and Carrot Halwa and on call breads (All in just $14.5, that's even cheaper than India). The service and ambience was also good. Its a nice family restaurant for both Veg/Non-Veg Indians. Kudos Team. Please keep up the taste
3
The restaurant is very homely with friendly staff and waiters. The cleanliness is average for restaurants in Singapore but the cleanliness depletes a slight bit as the night progresses. Pricing was a bit unsettling considering the amount of food provided and the quality of it. The buffet runs up to 11 p.m. and they do not refill the trays if the clocks goes one minute off 11! The buffet itself would be below average since the choice and flavor of food was subpar. The restaurant itself is a bit crammed inside with little walking and breathing space but it's manageable.
3
Tried Sitara for the first time despite being in Singapore for 2 years. Never got a chance earlier. Overall i was happy with the India food we tried.Pros: taste of the food we tried was good. Palak paneer and some special aloo with chutney sauce with naan bread. So can say Indian Ala-carte options can be triedLime soda drink we well made. Not many restaurants in SNG make that well. The prices are ok and not towards the high side as you see with few restaurants in SNG.Cons: they have a prime location but somehow i found the interior bit dull and service people having tired look on their faces even during the day.The ladies at the counter were yelling at her staff and that was mostly disturbing while eating food. She may be owner or restaurant manager but i don't think yelling at your staff when you are in business is good. Service was good if not great. Overall good time spent
5
We had food with reluctance but came out with a feeling of eating for at home. Nice indian food for all
4
I had been to this restaurant few years back and had a good indian buffet.
So this time thought of visiting with my family.
We just had 2-3 basic indian dishes which was good
2
Chicken over here is not cooked properly...! We have been here for dinner buffet over the last 3 days ... Ambience was also okay oaky ok ..!
4
This is the first restaurant we visited since we landed in Singapore and very good food and meals are very tasty and prepared freshly served piping hot.
Yummy
1
Dined on 2nd Nov 2016Time 8.30pmHad buffet Dinner (coupons provided by Travel Agent)the staff at restaurant treated us like cattle herds. The staff looked more like bouncers here.there was a rude chinese lady who shifted us from the 'A-la-carte' area by reminding us that we belong to the buffet herd and will not be treated at par with the paying diners.Now lets talk about food - Dal and kheer were the only edible items, however the best was the pappad. rice was thick and was of poor quality. 'saag chicken' was a boiled concoction while the fish curry was as tasteless.Overall a extremely bad and almost humiliating experience.However I cannot talk about the experience of the 'A la Carte' diners as they seemed the privileged lot.Indian tourist with lunch and dinner coupons must avoid this 'NO STAR' Sitar
5
We thought it would be a shame not to have an Indian meal whilst in Little India in Singapore. You can't go far wrong with this restaurant. Staff were great meal was great. Staff were happy to spice up or down the different dishes as we wished. Reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Would recommend to anyone
4
This is a family run restaurant that's been operating in Little India for more than 20 years. On our visit, we went with a regular who ordered from the a la carte menu (which is extensive).Everything we had was freshly prepared and tasty. A few highlights:1. Crispy deep fried fish in a tandoori style marinade and tender chicken tikka. Best were eaten warm right after they reach your table.2. Lamb briyani - lovely deep flavours and finely minced lamb. If it was served in the dum briyani style with a pastry crust, it would have been perfect.3. Paratha stuffed with potato. 4. Gulap jamun- a traditional Indian sweet made from deep fried spiced milk solids. The Sitara version is served in a milky rice pudding with a sprinkling of chopped pistachio nuts on top. This is a very rich dessert but worth saving room for.  Service was friendly and efficient.Little India can get very busy during the weekends and reading the other reviews here, it would seem that the restaurant also offers buffet meals for tour groups on a voucher system. I would say then aim to have a meal here when there is no buffet and perhaps outsider weekend
1
We went there for a dinner buffet we were 7 people and owner behaved very badly she was in a hurry to push us out as soon as possible. We would have let go of this if food would have been good but the food was even worst
3
Dinner buffet on a Saturday night soon after checking in at a nearby hotel. I went in at about 930 PM by which time the salad and papad bowls were empty. Items on offer were dhal, vegetable curry, chicken curry and goat keema. Tastewise everything was below average. There was no dahi and I had to scrape the bottom of the raita bowl to get some dahi. Rava halwa was practically uneatable. No drink of any kind was offered. May be it was my late entry but what I got was not worth the S$ 21 that I paid. Today I got a sumptuous thali meal at a nearby restaurant at half the price
3
Initially it was mentioned by our trip operator Tourland in our itinerary , but actually not booked , we reached there , staff was not cooperative , specially lady managers on counter were rude angry and egoist not fit for the front desk.overall not recommended.buffet food was average but Ala carte food was ok. sitting in the restaurant was also average
4
Well since no Nepalese food were nearby from tour, it was a nice catch at a reasonable price and that is Buffet dinner ot lunch in and around S$17. They have special discounts too.
GREAT TASTE.
Cheers from Kathmandu
3
It is located on main road- Serangoon road. Easily approachable. Near to Little India.
You can have vegeterian food at 17 SGD .
Taste is good.
4
As the restaurant located near by the hotel we stayed, we just tried to test the taste...for a lunch... nice interiors, smiling waiters, the food stuff was awe some. whenever i think about singapore, sitara restaurnt also flashes in my mind
4
Lovely aurhentic Indian meals, reasonible price, whilst visiting Little India in Singapore. Service very good and attentative.
4
The food was good and tasty. The service was also good. Tried lassi and found it to be ok. The indian food was also tasty and was also nt that expensive
5
Specially I tried salted lassi, and the lemon butter chicken, Onion Kulcha ahh great mouth watering. I wish them best. And their staff presentation and service is also very good. Thanks all.

After staying in Sentosa for 3 days when we came to Singapore we happened to come across this restaurant as it is bang opposite Mustafa Mall. We were so relieved find a Indian restaurant which serves vegetarian food!They had a Lunch Buffet aa well as A-la-carte options, but Buffet seemed to be quite average with limited options around 17$ per person so we went for A-la-carte.Food was delicious and we enjoyed it. Ambience was okay. It's usually crowded and noisy.
3
I along with my family visited was dropped by my travel guide for dinner at Sitara Restaurants. I showed the lady manager wearing specks of the restaurant's my food voucher issued by my travel agent namely Tourland Travel PTE LTD 11277 but she refused that no dinner is booked by the travel agent . I requested the lady manager to confirm the same with our tour operator but she behaved rudely and refused to call.Thereafter I offered to pay at own for my dinner than I was allowed to take my dinner. I was told that 20% discount will be given to me but after food when I made payments no discount was given. Please be careful settled all terms before making any order , the staff is not courteous or humble in the restaurant's. Food is ok . But take ala carte food rather buffet.
5
I went to this restaurant with my cousin after visiting sentosa islandRestaurant is busy with many peopleSo u need to make reserve prior to goAnd the food is good and it is standard to our Indian taste and up to the mark it's good
1
We were a group of 28 people from Dubai went of dinner on 27th March 2016, The two old ladies seems to be the owners in the counter treaded us very badly, as if we are eating for free. We have to wait for the Roti more than half an hour and when we asked they said â€œyou have to wait otherwise you can go to another restaurant. Food is not tasty, expensive and even one Coke she charged 5.25 SGD and it other good restaurants nearby charges only 2 or 2.5 SGB. Dear Indian friends from India, Middle East please avoid this restaurant instead you can choose other North Indian restaurant nearby. They should treat customers with respect irrespective of places where they come fro
4
We had been over here for 3times last week...
Superb north indian Buffett food...
Hot butter roti or nan or chapati is the best thing....
For non vegetarian indian people, must visit place...
3
Food tastes are not good! Price is very high! Lacking of cleanliness inside restaurant. Stuffs are also not so polite!
1
Damn Expensive, Not worth what you pay ,i find the same boiled chicken pieces in Kadai chicken and also in biryani.. Don`t dare to try chicken biryani ;)
5
Its a great place. Loved the food. Very good service. A complete Indian menu. Little on a expensive side but its worth the taste. For 2 people cost about 3500 Every dish we ordered was truely tasty.
3
Very Bad attitude with the customers. They feed the people, as if we are eating for free. THe same desert and Mutton Kheema curry repeats every day. Keep this as a last option if Riverwalk Tandoor, Kebabs and curries and jewel of India are running FULL.Have some respect for the customers. and keep the tables clean
2
Cheap attitude with customers. even dinner was not completed by our group members even plate was removed when asked replied by the owner of restaurant some big group is coming . when we have not completed dinner & plates were removed this we seen in first time in singapore. it was very samefull for hotel as well as for singapore country
2
The waiter was miserable only looked and spoke to my husband totally ignoring me, even offering him the menu but placed mine on the table! It was an insult to ask for a 10% service charge on the bill because the service was non existent. We should have got up and walked out but we were too hungry. The food was okay but would NEVER go back EVER!
1
We went to this restaurant to try out new foods but when we entered the restaurant the buffet was already finished. The staffs r very unprofessional,it seemed that they were wandering here n there and cannot see the customers! There was a couple next to us who requested the staff to clean the table as it was dirty but the old Chinese lady was too slow and careless to come over and clean, nonetheless when she was approached she started shouting and then seemed less bothered to clean, then another staff came and cleaned. There was a lady in the cash section who seemed to be the owner or manager, she is very rude as well. None of the staffs r welcoming. We ordered chicken hakka noodles, it was a simple chicken noodles, i guess the guess the chefs has no idea what hakka noodles mean! The foods ate very expensive, we were surprised to see the prices of the items on the menu.Definitely will never come here again
2
Very expensive for what we got. Initially the waiter made us repeat all our orders - we thought he might have difficulties with our (Irish) accents. Then a couple who sat down in the restaurant the same time as us received popadaums and chutneys - nothing for us.The food was good but the bill was very dear - 160 Singapore dollars for 3 of us. The person who brought us the bill then noticed we had taken a bottle of water that was on the table and which we thought was complimentary. He went off and added 3 dollars more to our bill and when we paid it - he never once said thank you or spoke to us. We left with the impression that they didn't really want 'our type' in the restaurant
2
Went to Sitara Restaurant to grab a quick bite and the guy came to take the order after 15 minutes after couple of reminders. We save time we ordered only plain rice with plain yogurt and tea. To serve this "almost ready order" they took another 20 minutes. By the time the food came, our time elapsed and we had to gobble it down and rush out. Unfortunately, we had to cancel the order of tea as they had shortage of resources/ staff to prepare tea. Food was very good but visit only if you have ample time or else you will savor more of frustration
3
Good buffet lunch options for people wanting to have Indian food.
Their methi murgh and mutton kheema were awesome.
5
If you want to have good indian food Sitara is the place. Just in front of Mustafa. The food was actually better than some good delhi restaurants.
4
We bought the deal voucher online for the lunch buffet. The food was good, one of the best Indian food I have tried in Singapore. Location is very convenient and service is prompt too. Will be back again.
2
Average food at average price nothing special in the menu...was dissapointed at the the lack of tandoori chicken which is a main dish at most indian restaurant s
5
Opposite to Mustafa center, on Serangoon road, Sitara restaurant is one of the best place for dining. The variety and food taste is better than other places. It has one of the finest dining experience during our trip in Little India. The food taste was really good... You will love it
5
If one were off to Singapore and especially if you are an Indian the first thing that comes to mind is food, and this restaurant is located just opposite the Mustafa Center a 24 hour open retail Store / mall.Here the food is awesome you can order anything you want from the menu and you would not feel as if you are eating somewhere outside India. Food taste, quality and quantity is sufficient to cater to anyone's taste and also the pricing is perfect.I did not check if they accepted reservations in advance but they are open until 11pm in the night and if you are keen on having drinks with your meal, they have an outdoor seating for you to enjoy your meal peacefully without disturbing others
4
I had been to Singapore few days back. We got a chance to have our dinner at Sitara Restaurant that was only 5 minutes away from our hotel. The moment we entered the restaurant, i got an Indianized feeling and every decor was aesthetically arranged. We had our dinner buffet and i must say all the dishes were delicious and wonderfully prepared
4
We reached this place quite late around 10PM. As we were driving and were expecting to stare at a parking nightmare in Singapore little India. To our surprise, this restaurant has 2 parking lots and we were allowed to park free. A lady (probably the owner) was very courteous (which is rare in Singapore...no offense). Good Indian food with reasonably good quantity. It is also reasonably price
4
Like: Very varied menu, good pricesDislike: A little too open airLike many restaurants in Singapore, there is some element of "Open Air". In this case, several windows were cracked. We had a few "shoo fly" moments. Not that it detracted from the experience enough to really dwell on it.The food was really good, and as part of the "Little India" area, you can imagine the cuisine. There were many other ethnic choices as well, but of course the focus was Indian
4
The Indian food served in here was excellent.We went there to have our lunch and the dishes were great.The food was very delicious and our whole family enjoyed the food.The location is very convenient and it's just infront of Mustafa.Probably one of the best Indian cuisine I've ever tasted.The rice pudding we had for the dessert was so good.The food was really good that we even came here to have our dinner that day...I will surely come back again..
3
A good Restaurant with Good Food but the problem is with the Staffs and Manager ..Do not go there when they are serving for Groups because once they have groups they never treat you good..
5
Staff and Indian food at its best. Try their Chilly Chicken for sure. Rates are quite good as well. The location is just opposite Mustafas and close to Fortuna Hotel.
5
Ww just walked in and were surprised to note indian music. indian food. Actaully for a minute you forget you are in Singapore. we were served well. The food was good. na's were crisp not soggy like most of teh places have.
4
Although the restaurant does not have wide sitting space but the quality of the food is nice indeed.
The buffet spread is wide and you may choose numerous varieties of food.
4
Nice buffet restaurant with reasonable prices, direcly next to mrt station and not far from mustafa center
4
Since this restaurant is located on main road and very near to Mustafa, this became logical reason to visit here for sunday lunch. It offered Lunch buffet at moderate prices. The taste was good
4
decided to check this restaurant out after getting a deal.com coupon to break our fast.place a bit outdates but it has this 80s charm to it. the ambience is peaceful too. the service staff are friendly and always ask customer need.the food varieties are sufficient and tasty. i really like the yoghurt n fish curry. but their best food are the naan. it is soft and tasty that u will keep ordering over n over again. the papadum us unlimited.this is a rare restaurant that provides unlimited naans and unlimited papadum
4
Being a vegeterian in Singapore is not easy :) Thanks to restaurants like Sitara one can afford to savour Indian food and that too finely vegetarian. Their Paneer dishes are awesome. Dal Makhni could have been a little better! But truly wonderful was their Garlic Naan. Good value for money. Even the serving staff is very courteous
4
We decided on this place due to the location (close to the Park Royal Singapore). Firstly, don't opt for the Buffet. It looked horrible. We just went for the food off the menu, and what we got was awesome. Check out the photos, they'll speak for themselves
4
Very tasty food and true value for money. Must try once here when in little India. Better than others on the same road. We ordered delivery which they did not do and had to go there to collect food, but taste and quality makes us rate Sitara I've star experience
