Great place for a day or night out with friends and furkids. The ambience is perfect for chilling out and chit chat. The dessert looks fancy but I feel it could have been better.

like the band. food wise, portion is pretty huge. enough to share with 2 pax.
everything is good except 1 for 1 variety is limited.
will still go there again.
4
A little too pricey for my liking, though it serves good quality food with a nice ambience! I'd recommend trying their waffles and fish & chips
4
Quite good place for hang out or dating. Didn't try their food. But their beverages options quite a lot.
4
the cafe is quite big and is able to seat quite a number of patrons, which makes the ratio of staff:patrons quite low. Some effort was required to get the attention of a server just to take down our order. but in spite of the large crowd, food was served pretty quickly (hot food was served to our table before my coffee!). Had the breakfast pan and french toast (with sunnysides up & bacon), and they were really good! Tried their toffee nut latte and it's actually way better than what you get at Starbucks

A slightly harder to find place in Punggol (near Punggol Promenade Riverside Walk). Has a very good quality of food. Offering ice cream from Movenpick. Good selection of food from starters, mains, pastas, bar bites, desserts, beverages, beer & wines, house pours & premium pours and cocktail

Went with family for birthdayâ€™s celebration. Waiting time for food was quick and prompt service. Relaxing ambience with latest music selection. Average food with above average price tag. Nothing to shout about the food. Dessert time! Ordered a chocolate cake for surprise birthday song singing. At this point, everything was still quite pleasant. 1 snobbish auntie server came frustrated straight to our table with unlit cake and kept asking for birthday person. Everyone was shocked at this level for service, this was totally uncalled for and very unprofessional. All it took was a moment of bad service to ruin a joyous birthday celebration. Not gonna to visit this establishment anymore.

Great place for what not. Good for friends, family and kids. Menu is simple yet content is yummy. Loved their atmosphere and food display. Friends can Chill while Families can watch over their kis play in the play area while they enjoy the scrumptious food. I went there for branch and we spent about 3 hours there..Goooooddd Food...! i hope they open another branch in the central or west.. i traveled from Choa Chu Kang to Sengkang.. but not complaining... it was worth it. Will def go back again! The place and the setting just makes any simple visit a memorable one

We found ourselves at Punggol for the first time last weekend for the Performance Series running race. The Whisk & Paddle was a great find! LocationOverlooking the Punggol Serangoon Reservoir waterway and only a few steps above the Punggol Promenade Riverside Walk. We came by cab and left by LRT (Riviera stop). There was plenty of paid parking nearby. FoodWe had egg benedict with bacon, waffles and toast. The eggs bene came on a waffle which was quickly subbed out for the toast we'd also ordered. I would return for the jam alone. It was amazing! The kids barrelled through the waffles. A bit boring, but they were happy and wanted to get back to playing. KidsA small play area with dinosaurs, wild animals, blocks and a small plastic see-saw. Our kids at 5 and 7 were entertained, but at the top end of the age range. Good for toddlers/preschoolers. Shoes off (our kids didn't realise and were politely asked by staff). Kids were given kid-sized cutlery and plates. ServiceSuper fast. 10 minutes from arrival/order/food. We arrived at 9:15am, and were first in line for their 9:30am opening. Others in that initial flood of people waited 30 minutes. Cost$13.90 for an eggs bene. Toast with jam around $5-6. Plain waffles around $10. Plus coffee - which were well made. All around... We had a great time. We came early so the service was fast, the weather was cool so the lack of airconditioning didn't matter, and we were already in the area. For us, a five

Food was pretty okay, service quite slow maybe because the place was crowded at dinnertime, but it took a fair while for the staff to notice our hands that had been up in the air for some time, and some frantic waving was needed to get their attention. Food also took some time to be served. The atmosphere was good though, very chill and laid-back (

Nice breakfast place with lovely natural ambience. Good food for the price. My husband and mom really loved it.
4
Good experience dining here even just for coffee and dessert! Service was quite prompt and would definitely visit again
4
We usually pick this place if we want a good brunch over a good view with our fur babies as they allow dogs in the outdoor seating. I usually order the pancake or the big breakfast which are always filling and delicious!
4
Weather was slightly on the hot side and you can definitely feel it if you take the non air-conditioned area. Food was good and definitely a place to hangout due to its vibrant ambience.
4
Nice cozy place by the park with very good music to chill. Good food selection and yummy. Recommended for weekend chill out

To have a peaceful and nice surrounding Saturday brunch is rare in Singapore but we found this hidden gem in Punggol. It's next to the nature scenery and the cafe is big enough to accommodate families for brunch after their morning exercise. The cafe is very accommodative and the staff are friendly and very prompt when we need their help. Food served very fast. 5 minutes after we ordered. Portion is good and the food are delicious. Money worth for food quality, staff service and the comfortable place to have brunch.

Whisk and Paddle is nicely situated overlooking a river which makes it ideal for Sunday brunches. The place is really huge and we didn't have to wait to be seated. The menu has all types of food and has great variation from breakfast food to pastas and pizzas. However be prepared to wait for a minimum of 30 mins for the food to be served since Sunday is a peak day for them. The wait is all worth it though since they have very generous servings and everything we ordered was delicious. All in all we enjoyed our experience and will surely come back.

This restaurant has a great spot aling Punggol river.Nice to sit outdoors and enjoy not being crammed in.Great selection of food ranging from the usual egg breakfast choices to pastas and cakes plus much more. I want to come back to try the onin soup.Infact at 10am some diners were drinking beer, some were having nachos and we had bacon and eggs.We had excellent service.Good feedback on the wait for our meals as we came at peak time.Loved the option to help yourselves to cold water.Very well priced.Excellent choice for those living in the East wanting a unique outdoor dinning atmosphere.There is indoor seating as well if you wish.Great churros too
5
Cool ambiance, cool staff, great pancakes and nice music. This was our first time in Punggol and we chanced upon this place after a long walk in the park. This is the perfect location by the water to chill with friends. We'll be back to enjoy the food

Price for some dishes as follows :-Coq Au Vin $28.8Duck Lychee Pizza $17.80Fish & Chips $25Prime Pork Ribs $28.80Oriental Wings $12Nachos Cheese $10.80Trufle Mayo Fries $10.90Louisiana Wings $12A lot of fried stuff on the menu

Cycled here for Sunday brunch with the family. Easy to reach on the Singapore park connectors. Food and service both good. Nothing to criticise. Particularly good if you have small children - they have a very nice play area.
4
Food was nice and the staff was attentive. The prices are on a higher side given the location. Portion sizes were reasobable.
4
We usually go there for late breakfast during the weekend and is a nice spot to relax a bit. Food is good, although choices are a bit limited.
5
Meal:Food quality was alright, pricing wise can be a little more affordable
Atmosphere: Love the atmosphere, great for any size friends or family gatherings
Service: Pretty quick, friendly staff

We were here for a hearty breakfast and were not disappointed. Service was efficient and the menu was extensive. The eggs Benedict on waffles was unusual and surprisingly yummy. Iced tea with elderflower and lemongrass was an unusual combination and did not disappoint - refreshing 
4
The location of this place is a little out there, but it makes for a great view. Place is usually packed on weekends, but service was still pretty good. Our food came fairly quickly, though there was a little delay in bringing the bill. Above average prices but eh, worth it, I think

We came here for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning. It's as others said - this place is kinda out of the way, but parking is pretty much available if you come here early. The place was crowded with youngsters and teenagers, though there is a kids' corner for families with toddlers to have some fun with while having breakfast.Ordered the below items:- Breakfast in a Pan ($19.80)- Salmon w/ Eggs Benedict ($13.00)- Hot Chocolate ($5.50)- Long Black ($4.50)The food was pretty decent, though it was really nothing special about it.The hot chocolate was too sweet (!) and I had to ask for a glass of hot water to dilute it.The long black was quite alright as well.The place overlooks the Punggol Serangoon Reservoir, so it can be a peaceful sight (not peaceful if it's crowded though!).There were plenty of servers, though they all look a little inexperienced and sometimes were moping around and inattentive to customers.This place serves alcohol (when the sun goes down), so it's probably not a place for kids when night falls.Total bill came up to $50.38, and honestly, I did not feel like I obtained the full $50+ value for the food and service. But nevertheless, it's a good location if you're in the area and want to have a meetup with friends after a morning run along the park connecto

A hidden gem, I had been staying around this area and was surprised to know of this cafe when my Friend brought me there. They have plenty of parking so no worries if u have car else u can take lrt which is within walking distance. It was around 10plus on Saturday, pretty crowded by the time we reached. Lots of cyclists stopping by for breaks I think. They offers both indoor n outdoor seating area. We chose the outdoor and surprisingly we did not sweat a abit.The service is prompt, as I noticed they have quite a handful of service staff on standby at all areas so they are able to react faster I Guess. Their food menu is foolproof with pictures, with that I can bring my old folks there without explaining or even asking them to visualise how the food is like. I had the egg benedict with a half waffle n bacon plus a cafe latte. My Friend had French toast with bacon with macha latte, lastly my Daughter had waffles with bacon n chocolate milkshake.The waffles is crispy on the outside and Soft fluffy inside. My gal love every bits of the milkshake, she finished it all and told me multiple times in the day how nice the milkshake is. I love to drop by again soon!

This is a amazing place we been before, food was nice and staff was very friendly near by my house, at Punggol place. Behind there have a park .. wonderful environment ambience, we love it so much. We love the pasta & chicken wings and dessert there, highly recommended.

Average food - not too bad and not really good either It's more of a place for you to wind down after a tough day and be close to natureI love that it's just next to the waterway and park. Convenient for runners and cyclist to drop by post-exerciseCooling in the evening

We were visiting a friend's in Punggol and dropped by this restaurant. Not much expectation but turned put we had a very good breakfast. The fresh orange juice really good. However, service can be better.
4
Good food, great view and out of the city. Places like these are a must try for locals and tourists alike. It might be slightly out of the way but there are ways to visit this place using public transportation.

I've never been to this part of town before and it is a little hard to get from Punggol MRT itself but it was definitely worth it. I was there to celebrate my friend's birthday and the waiter was happy to help us with the birthday cake. The food was excellent, especially the fries and pasta. It can be a little pricey though. One suggestion is for them to add guacamole to the nachos and give larger portions of sauces but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed myself there! They have a darts corner to play and also indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating comes with a free view of the beautiful Punggol Serangoon Reservoir!

Our destination today is uluu uluu Punggol! This newer housing estate in Singapore, developed in more recent times has often been neglected and underexplored by Singaporeans. But it is precisely this reason that we decided to head over to Punggol today where a number of restaurants and cafes have sprung up and have been attracting rave reviews online! Our target today: Whisk & Paddle, has apparently made it into the top 20 cafes in Singapore for 2015 on food review website Burpple.We must have been pretty crazy to brave the heavy downpour to just try out some café. A 5 mins walk from Riveria LRT station, we arrived at the storefront with hair dripping wet and shoes drenched from the rain. Feeling a little chilly from the rain, I was relieved to find that the café has sheltered outdoor seating (would have frozen to death in air-con).The use of LED lights decorations by the eatery give diners a warm and cozy feeling. The spacious open concept of the café also makes good use of its natural surroundings. One side of the café opens up to reveal the beautiful tranquil Punggol waterways. Huge ceiling fans will also keep diners cool on a hot sweltering afternoon. Moving on to the food, we ordered a Festive Breakfast Set (comprising of waffles, scrambled eggs, ham, German sausage, grilled mushrooms, cherry tomatoes & potato slices) and Tiger Prawns with Mac & Cheese. (Both dishes priced at SGD $22)Served on frying pans, the dishes were certainly pleasing on the eye and Instagram worthy. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, waffles are best savored by spreading blueberry jam over them! However I was disappointed with the scramble eggs. Though soft and fluffy, they tasted bland. Compared to the scrambled eggs I had at Australian Dairy Farm in Hong Kong (reviewed previously on another post), Whisk & Paddle’s paled in comparison. The Mac & Cheese we had was surprisingly good though. Normally one would be sick of Mac & Cheese halfway through the dish or overwhelmed by its strong distinctive cheesy flavor but the one we had wasn’t like that. Perhaps it was because the sauce wasn’t as creamy and thick. Its salty flavor keeps you coming back for more. The tiger prawns used were small but fresh, its meat texture firm. The café also offers a wide range of other mains and finger food. The quiet and peaceful environment makes this café a perfect place to relax and chill. Catch up with friends over a meal or read a book and enjoy a cup of cappuccino. If you are looking for somewhere to unwind and chill the afternoon away after a long tiring week, then head down Whisk & Paddle

I found that our food today was much better than my last visit on New Year's eve. The Eggs Benedict was well poached & comes on a waffle instead of bread. The Vongole Linguine was excellent with its great sauce and juicy clams. Apple Crumble Cheesecake was not very rich and u can't taste much of the apple crumble

Brunch is popular with families and cyclists, expect to queue during weekends.We thought the food is ok but are slightly pricey.Service is prompt and polite, paying attention to the little ones.Bacon and Hotdog, egg benedict, our delicious breakfast. But we would recommend the waffles.If it is not too warm, choose a seat offering view of the riverside promenade. Price inclusive drink came up to $110 for 2 adults 4 kids. Too expensive

Went there around 11.00am, place was a bit crowded. We enjoyed the outdoor sitting arrangement but was a bit hot. Foods were ok unless you are looking for those that you think is good. To us, we find that it is ok as most cafe having almost the same type of menu.Most important of all is the service they provided and the environment. Their service was good, staff are attentive when you run out of water they will come to fill it for you rather than some where you need to ask them. Sitting outdoor you will have a nice view. Children friendly environment. Good place to relax and enjoy the view. Good meeting place with friends for gathering

I'm not really sure what the buzz for this place is about, food is here rather "normal". Like the quality of the food was average. Presentation of the food looks basic. The vibe of the cafe/restaurant was not bad tho.This service staff members were alright.Tho I must say given that they are dog friendly, I'm not entirely sure I'll go back there again, simply for the fact that their quality of taste, of the food is normal. Thanks for taking the time. Cheers

I've been wanting to visit Whisk and Paddle ever since I saw the green trees and a river that was just within a stone's throw from the café. I almost took a taxi there but decided to use the MRT instead because it was about a 21 min drive from Lavender. So during our first day in Singapore I dragged Hubby along for a joyride to Riviera LRT. Don't worry, we had never even heard about the LRT line before today but the café was within 5 minutes walking distance from the LRT.Whisk and Paddle was a popular choice for cyclist and families especially since it was a bit of a mini getaway place from the always busy city. I think a lot of people appreciate the change of scenery that they could find within the small area. Service was really good and the staff was quite attentive as every customer were given glasses of cold water right as they sat down. There was a small kids' corner where little boys and girls can enjoy some activities using toys provided by the café. If you can't bear the humidity, there is also indoor seating available for customers.One important tip: as soon as you get off the Riviera LRT, take a lift / stair down and use your google maps to locate the Punggol Police Station. Once you've found the police station, there's a restaurant complex nearby (Popeye's Chicken, Seafood restaurant etc and you will see the Whisk and Paddle café soon enough).FOODThe humid weather made hubby crave cold drinks more than usual so he ordered a glass of yellow mango smoothie. I went with the black sesame latte instead, a drink that will certainly make a person conscious of having black sesame powder stuck on their teeth after a few sips. I like my black sesame latte since it wasn't too strong and it came with pretty coffee art too.We tried the Pandan Melaka waffle that came with Movenpick Vanilla Dream ice cream, cubic butter cakes, roasted cashew, gula Melaka and bits of cornflakes. Today's waffle was crispy and it had a really good texture. The Madagascar vanilla icecream didn't disappoint too and to be honest it was probably the best vanilla ice cream that I ever tasted! Every material worked well together and also perfect to be shared between two people. Next time I will request an extra bowl of gula Melaka ;-)

On a cool breezy evening, nothing beats having a meal than along the river, in this case Punggol river. Spacious with choice of indoor and outdoor dining, this quaint restaurant offers a nice range of finger food, pastas, pizza and a range of deserts. Happy hour offering $10 a bottle of Asahi is just perfect to ease into the relaxed environment, especially if you plan to watch how nightfall approaches, without the burning sun. The place is also great for those with dogs as seating can be arranged for pet owners without fear of restaurant patrons accidentally kicking your pet
