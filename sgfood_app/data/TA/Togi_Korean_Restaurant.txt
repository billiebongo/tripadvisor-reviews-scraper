I was very impressed with this place. The Owner and the staff were very accommodating. The food was fantastic, so much so, we made several visits before leaving Singapore.

The restaurant can be overcrowded at times, be there early or late. Has been there for their cold noodles, naengmyeon. Always love their broth! The banchans are good too.
5
Excellent food and service!! Must pay a visit here and it will definitely not fail you!! Came with friend just by googling and it really surprised us!

If this is what is considered great korean food, cooking your own at home would be a better choice. The bimbimbap rice was overdone and soggy, almost porridge like. Even the small appetisers seemed to be done as an after thought.

I stopped to eat in this restaurants because it was frequented by locals and was packed. The food was very tasty.

We were wandering around Chinatown and this family run Korean restaurant caught our eye mainly because it was full of locals rather than tourists. We tried two beef dishes - a soup and a stir fry. Both were OK but perhaps a bit too ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô in their flavouring and spices for our taste. People seemed to b enjoying their food so it was probably us. The service was helpful.

Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but stealing one‚Äôs identity is totally different. I wonder how this owner runs his business if he takes someone else‚Äôs logo (creative property) and use it as his own. This logo (Togi) was personally designed by my dear friend‚Äôs sister who is a professional graphic designer. Togi design was originally created for their restaurant in New York City. I am appalled to find out this exact same logo is being used in Singapore as though it is their own. I question his business ethics and thus question his food even more.

Been here a few times and was never disappointed in any of the visits.Service is great, food is great especially the side dishes.Atmosphere is ok.Recommend to try the Seafood Hotpot if you have at least 4 people as the portion is quite big.Good portion, great variety and definitely a value for money.In my top 3 list for my Korean food craving
4
despite prices escalating throughout the years, the standard has been quite consistent. owned by koreans though chefs are not korean. budae jigae is my staple, as well as the potato pancake. bibimbaps are good too. used to have long queue but not encountering that now. more seats (esp for big groups) upstairs but be prepared to smell a little after the meal
5
We were hot and tired and hungry in Singapore and stopped here for lunch. It completely restored us. The seafood pancake was cooked perfectly and the spicy pork and kimchi stir fry so tasty and very generous with the pork belly. Leaving Singapore tomorrow or we would be back regularly!
4
If you are Korean, talk to the owner in Korean. He will understand your expectations about how to be waited on especially in regards to banchan. The food is good, but it is always tough to compare to food in Korea.
4
Been here numerous times. They offer quite a wide range of dishes and they are indeed quite authentic. Price is not too expensive considering they are in prime area. Recommended!
5
The food is good and many choices , it was very full during lunch no empty table and i have to wait.
This place very clean and helpful staff
Must try the chicken gingseng soup üëç
4
Finally tried the seafood stew after many visits. It's really yummy. The soup was perfect for cooking the ramyeon at the end.

Run by a Korean family, the friendly atmosphere starts when you walk into the restaurant. You are greeted as if you are a regular customer of good friend and ushered to your table. This must be a key hallmark of coming here. You feel very comfortable from the start.The dishes on the menu are what you'd expect as if you are in Korea and they are reasonably priced too. The constant replenishment of the 6 side dishes is also a welcome difference from some other chain restaurants. We especially like the soups that are served here and are a definite recommendation. As we observed, if Koreans come here, it must be good and it is.Now that saying there is no pre reservation, so you might have to wait for a table if you come at peak dining hours. But once you order the food is served quite quickly. They sometimes open a little earlier than they state, so try coming just a little earlier. But that said, they do have a second floor and some outdoor seating if you don't mind the heat and humidity
2
After read all the positive reviews, came here for lunch with family. Waiting staff seemed indifferent when I asked for recommendation, thus had no choice but to place order without any help. Nobody told me that we had over-ordered. Food turned out to be tastless and over generous with salt. I don't recommend this restaurant at all
5
This place take no reservations so be prepared to queue on a weekend night. When I think of having Korean food, this is the best place to go to, and I've been here at least three times (my profile photo is from this place!).We used to have a Korean lady serve us with smiles and would occasionally pop by to even help barbecue the meat that we'd ordered. My last visit in June had accommodating staff as well. Great service goes a long way!Highlights: Seafood pancake (love it!), BBQ meat, stew

Dinner with colleagues at Togi Korean Restaurant. Waited to be seated. Friendly helpful waiters and waitresses directed to the designated table. Served with Korean tea before taking orders. Food served sizzling hot. Really tasty and little spicy.Enjoyed the meal. Asked for the bill and settled the payment. Above average prices for authentic Korean meal.Can consider this venue when visit Chinatown
5
Read the review of Togi while googling for korean stew in Singapore, so decided to try it.The spicy pork rib stew is heavenly! Bbq marinated pork collar is superb too. The korean lady boss was friendly and helpful. Her recommendation of soju was so good too! We really enjoyed our dinner especially on a cool wet day and will be sure to come back again
4
Just been there and the food is great, really tasty, authentic Korean food. The staff is rather friendly and the location is convenient, in the heart of Chinatown. I found it good value for money but it may not be, according to Singaporean standards. Nonetheless worth a visit, you won't regret it
5
Have eaten here for a couple of times. Love the Bibimba and Army Stew. You will be served with some appetizer dish before your food arrives (i.e. kimchi, peanut, etc). you may want to arrive early as the restaurant is normally quite packed.
4
Some of the choices are definitely close to the offerings in Korea. I am amazed by the quality but some others are downright disappointing. Would come back again though.
Suggest Ribs, Pancake, Kimchi and Spicy Beef Stew.
4
Had my first ever Army Stew at Togi and it was love at first taste! Love the free flow of appetizers, especially the potato salad.
Downside will be service as it always seemed to be short handed even on weekdays.
5
Still my favourite Korean restaurant in town, although their portion size has became smaller throughout the years. Authentic taste and love the side dishes that come along with it. A pity the orchard outlet was closed, though I always visited the Chinatown one as the Sajangnim is much friendlier.Must-try dishes: Bossam (boiled pork slices), seafood stew (for sharing among 3-4 pax), hot stone Bibimbap, stir-fried beef (so delicious!) and naeng-myeon (cold noodles)
5
Togi is my go-to place whenever I have cravings for Korean cuisine. It's hard to find a Korean-owned restaurant that serves everyday, home-cooked meals when the scene in Singapore is dominated by BBQ joints. I still haven't found kimchi that beats the ones served in Togi. It is just that good. Must try their army stew, black bean paste noodles, omelet fried rice, soft tofu soup and potato pancake! Despite the delicious food, I do find their food a bit pricey. Their service isn't top notch but the Korean lady boss is very nice and smiley. Be sure to arrive early for dinner. If not, you'd have to wait outside for an available table

Wanted to eat something Korean and after reading the good reviews here, I decided to check this out with my family in tow. We had:Pork Ribs Stew - it's a big pot of steaming stew that has vegetables and mushrooms in them. The waitress who served it would even proceed to remove the meat from the long rib bones for us. So every scope is just with really tender and flavourful pork meat and yummy soup. Excellent with some rice. Spicy Pig Trotters - it's a huge plate of pig trotters that's cut into chunks. I eat only the meaty bits and if you eat it with the lettuce leaves and garlic slices, it's wow wow wow! Not too spicy but has enough kick! Nice!!Bimbimbab - I've heard many people loving this rice combi so I ordered one with spicy pork to try. I'm won't order it again but I can see the draw of this dish. I guess it's not for me. Beef Gravy Soup - this has Korean vermicelli in it. Theirs is thicker than regular Chinese ones. The soup base is actually quite sweet and it really quite a nice dish. My girl loves it!Potato Pancake - this side dish is no side show! It's crispy and really tasty! My other girl loves it so much that she declared that when we return again, she is having 3, all by herself! I support her! HehThey served us 6 side dishes and they are:Kimchi - I don't like kimchi so no commentsPotato Salad - theirs has raisins in them so it's kinda sweet. Theirs also has bits of nut and the overall taste is just great!Garlic Vege - it's simple fare of saut√© green vege with garlic but it's so good!Spicy Ikan Bilis - it's sticky and a bit spicy and crunchy with white sesame seeds, how to go wrong?Peanuts - theirs is coated with this sticky black sauce that makes the taste interesting. Nice. Preserved Cucumber - it's refreshingly cold and crunchy too. Reminded me of our local acah. We couldn't finish all our food and the lady boss was happy to pack it for us. Many reviews complained of poor service but while service was not top notch, it's really quite ok. They gave us a 20% voucher for returning customers and we will be definitely be back to use it

They serve one of the best Korean pancake Ï†Ñ I had so far. We ordered pork rib stew, ginseng chicken soup, jabchap and seafood pancake. Food were delicious and authentic. We arrived at 7pm on a Friday evening, didn't need to queue but the restaurant was already 3/4 filled. The downside was they don't serve water, only mineral.water which we need to pay. Quite untypical of a Korean restaurant. The bali tea was also sold at $2 per bottle and we needed 2 bottles for 4 of us to quench our thirst due to the relatively rich flavours of Korean cuisine.
5
located in a quiet section in bustling Chinatown, togi is a wonderful hidden gem selling great homecooked style Korean food. We love the budae hot pot and the signature pork rib soup. The glass noodles are an absolute positive nod in the direction of yummy and to finish off your meal, wash it all down with a glass of refreshing unsweetened chilled Korean tea.
4
The lovely BBQ pork, I think it was the shoulder. Juicy and wonderfully seared pieces of delight in my mouth.We also had the seafood pancake (haesanmul pajeon) and I wish it was all crust! Nice crunch and generous toppings of seafood and spring onions.We also had the Chicken and korean ginseng soup (samgyetang), which was very flavourful. The sticky rice was also a pleasant surprise from the congee-like ones I've had previously in Malaysian Korean joints
5
Was really craving Korean food and it was one of the top suggestions in Singapore so we tried it. Upon arrival, there was about a 5 minute wait which was not long, and the host was very kind and jolly. We were seated upstairs which was a little hidden at first. Overall, the food was AMAZING and tasted so good, it was well worth the money and it wasn't even that expensive. Some restaurants leave you thirsty after having the meal because of msg/salt/spice content, but I was perfectly fine after.Would definitely come back
3
Not a good or bad restaurant, food was OK, service as well. Quality for money maybe a bit low but nothing to complain about. I had a Bimbimbap.
4
Needed food and this was there. Inside is clean, staff are friendly. Bulgogi and bibimbap were excellent. Really enjoyable experience.
4
In the heart of Chinatown, great place.
We had 2 types of Bibimbap and Rice with Beef that was simply great.
Service is slow and we had to ask for water few times.
Good experience and great food.
5
This delightful restaurant in Chinatown offers melt-in-your-mouth beef bulgogi. The side dishes served alongside were well-prepared as well. Service was kind and cheerful. And the prices very reasonable. Probably our happiest meal in Singapore this trip.

I'm new to Korean food. Before we'd even ordered, lots of little bowls of snacks or appetizers or maybe dinner accoutrements arrived. We loved the kimchi seafood pancake. Service was fantastic. This is a VERY popular place so arrive at 6pm when they open.
1
Craving Korean food, having had very good encounters with the Korean kitchen several times before, we chose Togi as this was recommended by several on Trip Advisor.We arrived a bit late, but that can hardly excuse the poor quality of the food served - which just looked flaccid and tasted old - and served with a grumpy attitude. In addition, it was rather pricey. Whilst eating the kitchen staff pushed the garbage bins through the restaurant, right in front of us.Not recommended
3
Read some reviews and decided to try. We were there at 6pm on a Sat and got a table immediately. Ordered the pork belly bbq and seafood tofu soup that was recommended in the reviews. The soup came and it tasted good when hot. The portions was small. They clearly forgot our order of the bbq item as we had finished the soup and it was still not served. The pork belly was tough and not as good as expected. The bbq sauce was ok. A little disappointed. We may come back if in the area to try the other food but will not return specifically.

Located on the second floor of 111 Somerset, the restaurant offers Korean food. If you are looking for a quiet place to dine, you can come here. The food here is light and not spicy, compared to the usual Korean cuisine.It is also spacious where tables are not packed close to each other
4
This is my 2nd time here and I must say the food is authentic korean food - well, the best you can get in Singapore that is.There are quite a number of korean dining here which probably speaks of the quality of the good, 'nuff said. That aside, the restaurant doesn't accept reservations so best be early and arrive from 6pm-6.30pm to beat the long queues!Note: Their ‡∏£‡∏Å la carte dishes comes in quite a big portion which is more then enough to feed 3 pax

Togi at Mosque Street has the most terrible Korean food that I have tried in Singapore. I ordered the spicy silken tofu seafood soup for lunch and I had to struggle through just to finish my meal. Only the fried anchovies and green bean side dishes were alright although the beans seemed like they had a lot of MSG added. I've a very low threshold of tolerance for MSG and the food here tasted like it had plenty of MSG in it. The prices were not cheap as others have mentioned but were similarly priced to other Korean restaurants. In fact, the Korean restaurants at Tanjong Pagar offer much better value than Togi
5
Had to visit this Korean place at least once a week for my quick Korean fix. Favourite is their bibimbap! Service staff is attentive too. Must try Korean place!
3
I enjoyed the food there expecially the kimchi , but you would really need to rush your meals as there is always a long queue there.
Not recommended if you are having gatherings there.
3
The waitress was lovely and attentive but the food was very bland and boring. Authentic korean but have had much better before. Easy quick lunch but wasn't anything to rave about
5
Have not yet find another better Korean run Korean resturant. Afforable price neat portion. Seafood pancake is nice.
4
I and my husband order bibimbap, kimchi soup, rib barbecue and black noodle. Bibimbap and noodle is so so. Barbecue seasoning quite well. And kimchi soup is the best for sure :) if I have chance to come back again, the only thing i want is to have kimchi soup again :
3
It was not a planned visit and how it attracted our attention was because there was a very long queue and the price seemed to be reasonable.We ordered the following dishes and my comments are below:- kimchi soup with pork: the kimchi they serve is on the sour side and thus it became a Korean version of Tom yum soup. I was given a big portion of meat and kimchi to the state I could hardly taste the soup so I had to move them to another plate. The meat was seasoned and cooked. As the soup was already quite sour and spicy so I didn't eat much kimchi in there. Overall it was okay if you like tom yum soup style.- seafood pancake: it was fried with egg which I don't prefer. Having said that, it was good even though I prefer the seafood pancake at red pig restaurant.- bibimbap: presentation was great and you can add chili source yourself according to your level of tolerance on chili. Not bad.- side dishes: I like their fried anchovies. They cooked it with herb and it smelled very herby and refreshing. I asked for second plate for this.Overall the food is average and this dinner cost us around 50 dollars for two persons. I have not tried their BBQ yet and not sure how good it is so I may visit this restaurant again to try other food.

Always be early if you don't like to wait because you will definitely have to wait as people just keep coming in during meal times. Love the appetizers, which are free flow. Personal favourite is the Budae jjigae (Korean army stew) and the gochujang (Spicy Rice Cake). The B.B.Q are also great if you're a meat lover.Try not to order too much as the portion are quite generous. Be sure to share.Staffs are friendly and attentive but they might take some time to get back to you as the place is always full. So try not to stay too long so that others can get a chance to eat there too. :
5
Togi is so popular that I will always try to go early in order not to queue for too long. Have tried other Korean restaurants but none beats the flavour and authenticity. Love the small dishes that come along! If you want great tasting Korean food in Singapore, TOGI is the place
3
The good:1) The food is okay and the portion was too big for asian girls so it's best to share. Most of the tables had steamboat, i guess that is what it's popular for.2) We were served by korean waitress with her thick korean accent. :) How authentic? They are quick and friendly3) Togi is clean. a big ++The bad:1) Lack of space: I nearly got squashed when people open the door and i was with a crutch. @.@"" 2) When it reach peak hours (lunch/dinner) people are queuing outside, and we felt we were rushed. 3) not suitable for people in wheelchair/crutch/ pram/ small kid. Think it's best to go before peak hours
4
Togi's owned by koreans and my korean colleague was telling me about it..as usual, the banchai is free flow... :)and korean mtvs are shown in the resturant.some items that i always order when i pop down to the restaurant 1) bibimbap2) korean ginseng chicken (soup refills are for free!!!)3) dukboogi (the mochi is so flavourful..)4) pork belly5) gyoza (OMG SO GOOD)6) seafood pancake (huge huge huge!)7) beef ribs~TIPS:1) the place is rather small, so try not to bring big bags and stuff like tt, if not you gotta deal with things being trampled on..2) its usually very very very very very crowded by the time its reached 7pm (dinenr time)try to go a bit earlier, around 630, and you'll be able to find a place to sit at..3) dont order toooo much food!!! its very filling.. :DHave a good meal and enjoy some soju
4
I hade the tasty, Bi Bim Bap served with at least six different kimchis'. Light and flavorfull dumplings also.
4
Great authentic korean foods. Friendly lady boss will even guide you on how to eat (handle) your cuisine in the best way. Free flow of wide ranges appetizer.
4
Casual and one of the best Korean restaurant in SG... Bring four pax at least and have the hotpot ...
3
Not too bad a place if u wan authentic korean food. Small place, a bit cramp but definitely nice food. Big portion for e price, worth it.
1
I think this is for local who looking for cheap korean food and dont mind poorer quality food.. but the service is good n the owner is friendly
4
A very homely restaurant with a good selection of authentic korean food. Very recommended!
4
Will go again. Run by Koreans. Very packed, need to book but food is served fast.
4
Good Korean food. Always packed. Friendly staff. Not sure if they are friendly to only Koreans though.
5
Excellent Korean cuisine... worth money and time waiting...
5
Just returned from another satisfied meal from Togi. 3rd visit and each time they never disappoint. Had BBQ Beef and pork belly, love the garlic, onions and mushrooms. Seafood Tofu soup is great too! The appetisers are a great way to start, especially the kimchi. If Koreans come here, it can't be wrong!The owner is friendly but the non-Korean staff seem a little lost in space!Ambience: casual, not for business talk, not for lovers talk as very packed with groups of friends gathering, so can be very noisy.Would definitely come back here!P.S. Be there by 6pm (when they opens) or after 8pm, else be prepared to wait in line for a table. It also closes relatively early, i think it is around 10pm
