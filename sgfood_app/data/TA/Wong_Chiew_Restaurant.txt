Corner coffeeshop with an air con dining next door! Affordable price with enough varieties. Food taste good with choices like Tim sum, roast meats, "ampang" yong tau foo, porridge & local zi char varieties. Worth a visit and best of all 24hrs! Always there when the hunger shouts!

Was here for our monthly family gathering.The place is located off the main roads and near to a a group of bungalows. Its a coffeeshop comprising of 2 different sections, the coffeeshop section with no air con and an air conditioned partition for customers who prefer a less warm dining experience. They serve 24 hour dim sum and we were skeptical of the quality due to this. However, i have to say the dim sum was generally palatable and pretty decent. This came as a pretty big serving and had a generous portion of fish in the pot. Its rather salty and lacked the sweetness i crave but my relatives enjoyed it.The salted egg prawns looks weird because of the batter that is used to coat the prawns. However, it turned out to be a hit. The batter was light and not oily while the salted egg taste was well balanced and complemented well. Prawns were pretty big and crunchy as well.This hit me as overly sweet but otherwise fragrant and tasted good.Overall, i picked some of the standouts to talk about but the general feel of the food was that it was above average for a Zhi Ca stall. Its 24 hours which is a bonus for late risers and the price is also very reasonable. 2 tables totaling 20 people with at least 10 dishes per table and drinks came to about $400 bucks. Your mileage may vary depending on what you order but its typically around this range.Check it out and see if its your kind of place.Verdict: Value for money and worth a tr

Went there as my sis recommended. The restaurant is quite out of the way but for those who are taking the public transport, there are buses that you can reach the place. The restaurant is right outside Thong Bee Road. We ordered about 5 dishes for our dinner but they were quickly gone as we were famished. Only managed to take a picture of the roasted duck that was served first. Their fish maw soup, french beans, deboned fried pork (gu lo yok) and sambal kangkong were good. We kind of ordered the same type of dishes whenever we go to different tze char restaurants. So the standard of the food there was commendable. The friendly male staff who took our orders could speak Mandarin and Hakka, so my mum who knew Hakka, was happy to be able to converse with him. There is a sink where you can wash your hands and the utensils (for those hygiene freak like me :p ) The price of the food is a little on the high side, as compared to other tze char restaurants.

Went for family lunch. Ordered tim sum, roast meats, yong tau hu n other small dishes. Roast meats were a failure, Roast duck too dry n salty, char siew n roast pork are too fatty n tastless. Yong tau hu was ok. What we enjoyed most were the tim sum n boiled vegetables. Price has gone up too. I will rather go else where near for food now

This is a 24 hour eating place, situated at the corner of Sembawang & Mandai Road. The place is simple but offers a variety of good local food. It is economical but don't expect very good service, - - you have to make payment after ordering the food. If you are hungry in the middle of the night, this is a good place to go to

The food was local Chinese quite a lot of variety and tasted average nothing special. Service was acceptable but the staff were not that attentive. Our Singaporean friends weren't impressed with the food and said they'd had better at this restaurant before, obviously picked a not so good day. The place was clean

We used to frequent thus restaurant for its vast variety of tasty food.However, today's visit is extremely disappointing based on points as follows :1) Variety of food is pathetic, whatever we wanted to order, its not available 2) Service: Almost non existence. Trying to talk to staff there is at best described as TRYING. They only give you 5% of their attention, turning away to talk to others halfway through a sentence. Frustrating to the maximum. They are also LOUD and mostly rude. When we wanted to request for chilli, we were cut off mid- sentence. When finally we managed to ask for it again, we were told off loudly we did not ask for it. Having said the above, definitely will NOT visit this place again

Interesting menu of some Hong Kong dishes cooked to the Singaporean taste bud. DimRecommended dishes include deep-fried lotus roots coated in salted egg yolk, black pepper crab and curry fish head. For a quick bite, I highly recommend the bbq pork with roast pork for $5 per serving with rice

A good spread of delicious Chinese food served up all day long. It's located just off the highway, but parking can be a pain at meal times. We usually grab the Tim Sum which is authentic, especially the chicken toes! Chicken and Char Siew is pretty decent that is served with rice or noodles
