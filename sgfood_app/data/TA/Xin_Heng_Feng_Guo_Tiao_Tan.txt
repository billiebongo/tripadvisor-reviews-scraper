You cannot go wrong with this place. Fresh fish, tasty soup, lots of yam and vegetables. Using good old fashion charcoal steamboat pots to keep your soup warm throughout your meal. You are given a few choices of fish meat. They also have side sides like soya bean puff, hard boiled eggs. Beware there is a very long waiting time at this place, come early like before 6pm. They only open for dinner

First tip: Make small talk with the lady boss! Talk about how the government forces them now to use liquid fuel instead of the old school charcoal! This got us seemingly better service and I assume portions!Save on the wet tissues! Bring your own. I personally recommend the sliced fish steamboat with tau pok (simmered fried bean curd) and the preserved vegetables! They are also famed for their fatty jelly, pregnant fish and chicken feet! Go early around 5pm to avoid a long queue, as well as getting a table with a fan on top! You'll thank me for it latter! There are many steamboats in Whampoa but this is the real stuff, they don't need to hog tables with canisters like the other stall in the other night whampoa market. This is the day whampoa market that supposedly has more open stalls in the morning. The stall owner is also very generous with self help - meaning you self help to soup, chilli, etc. They also carry side dishes to you in a big tray for you to see and order. And whatever was taken will be freshly replaced and then offered to the next customer which means you get only the freshest stuff! Advise: bring lots of tissue and be early and be prepared to sweat a little
