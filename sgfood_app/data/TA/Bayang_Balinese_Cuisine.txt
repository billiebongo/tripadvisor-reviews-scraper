We stopped here for lunch after a short river cruise from Clark's Quay. The selection of appetizers (satay, squid, giant prawns) was just right for two. It was fairly quiet when we were there (Sunday afternoon), but I can imagine it bustling at night.
4
A charming little restaurant in the middle of the crowded and noisy Clarke Quay area. You can enjoy Indonesian cuisine dishes in a friendly atmosphere. The food is great and the service is not bad at all. Highly recommended.
2
This is the second time I have been here and it was very disappointing. The staff were mostly interested in chatting with each other - the customer an inconvenience. Then the order was wrong - not suprsiningy given the lack of attention.Unfortunately the food itself is equally average - Gado Gado was basically a few cold vegetables and a side order of peanut sauce.Clearly Clarke Quay is a tourist trap but my suggestion is keep looking around avoid Bayang 
4
Clark quay setting is excellent for people watching and activities before and after dinner. We enjoyed the fresh dipping sauce of the satay and the marinade for the grilled squid was my favorite. Both proteins were cooked to perfection. The service started slow but got much better and the food came out quickly. I think we caught them at the end of a rush, otherwise 5 starts. We would go bac
3
Wenn went there for dinner. Appetizer selection made out of various small bites was tasty. Gado Gado could have been a little bit more Tastenfeld. But pea nut sauce was excellent. The reasons why i do not Give more points is service and atmosphere. Service was provided by young staff, friendly but not trained and could hardly handle any conversation apart from taking orders. No possibility to Talk about the food nor to alter orders
5
Could not fault the service at all, staff very friendly and helpful, both meals were absolutely wonderful and a shame we couldn't eat the last mouthful, will make this place a regular and advise anyone looking for a good feed to go, walked past about 2 hours later and one of the staff recognized my wife and gave her a friendly wave and smile, well don
5
We had a lovely lunch at Bayang. The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the service was nice and friendly. The lunch specials were a good option for something smaller and the standard options of Beef Rendang and Fried Chicken were great and came with plenty of sides.
4
There are so many options for eating out at Clarke Quay. We ate here one night while staying at Clarke Quay, ordering the satay dozen (half beef, half chicken), fries with dipping sauces and chicken wings. The service was quick, the food delicious and the two for one beer offer was a nice plus. We did get caught on the ++ pricing (add 17%) which is a sting in the final bill at restaurants in Singapore
5
Visited Bayang on our last night here having eaten in many of the restaurants in and around Clarke Quay during our week in Singapore and I can assure you the food is fab! We ordered the mango salad & spring rolls to start followed by a surf & turf platter and Ayam penyet set. Wow... amazing flavours and thought for the prices that the savings would be small but no - struggled to eat it all but it was so good I wanted to eat every last bit. Service was very good too - it's a must try if in Clarke Quay!
3
The food here was ok but lacked a bit in freshness and flavour. If you want good satay then Lau Pa Sat is a great option for flavour and the beer is half the price (although the environment there is not relaxing). The green mango salad lacked in flavour and freshness.
1
Below Average Balinese food. Not to my liking. This place is visited by foreigners. Service level is excellent as there aren't a lot of customers in this restaurant.
4
Singapore has all options available, but Bayang was a good place for enjoying Balinese food. The service though is slow, the food non the less is good. Try the yellow rice and chicken Satey.
5
We had a really good dinner here with the familly. Staff was attendant and service was quick. A bit pricy but food was delicious and you get away from the noisiest part so you can enjoy your food.
4
The food was tasty. Not really a family style concept where you can order few dishes and share. mainly good for an individual portion. Service was quick and efficient. Happy belly happy me!
3
Limited menu choices and only a passing resemblance to decent Indonesian cuisine. We were hoping to find a rijstafel but were disappointed. Service was hit and miss. Pricey, as is everything on Clarke Quay but this was not good value.
4
We had dinner here as a family of 4 and the food and service were all very good. Fried Rice, beef rending and crispy chicken were all delicious. It's off the main strip which is a bit quieter which was nice.
4
Quite & good looking restaurant. As vegetarian, It has been hard to find the right place, especially if you look for local cuisine, so the Balinese one has been a good option. Did not really like my Gado Gado & the Noodles were a bit tasteless, still I had a lovely night out. Thumbs up for the friendly staff that even helped us with our Glass coasters collection! :
4
There is plenty of choice at Clarke Quay, but not all great for kids (outside of the usual pizza). This place had good food for kids that was not too spicy and a decent variety. The kids had the satay stick and chicken drumlets with a side fries. The adults had curry chicken hot pot and chicken platter, both were tasty and chicken moist. Felt it was a tad expensive as was around $125 (without any alcoholic drinks). Service was good and food came quickly.
3
Nice place for Balinese style food. Presentation of food very good, starter platter had a good selection of nibblies. Main meals were very tasty, Nasi Goreng had lots of juicy prawns, hot satay sauce. Mee goreng had lots of flavours, spicy. Icy cold drinks. Restaurant tends to be a bit noisy & tables are set close together
5
We ate here late on night after a boat trip - not sure where to eat and stumbled upon Bayang - what a find!.We ate outside,shared vegetable spring rolls/dumpings for starters - light and crispy vegetables.Main was a bowl of delicious spiced curry,rice,vegetables and two garlic prawns butterflied.The food was superb,wonderful spices with a bite but sooo tasty - wish I was back there.BTW Wine or beer was 2 for 1 which we didn't realise until the lovely serving lady kept bringing us the drinks.Give it a try - really,really tasty meal
2
Of course you pay for the location, but 52sgd for a coke, noodles, 3 small sate sticks and a small mango salad is too much, considering it wasn't good either. Had a better 5$ indonesian lunch the following day
3
I come there for fish. It is good. Giant prawns are also quite ok. Alcoholic drinks are on the expensive site though. Overall, the food in this place is better than in the restaurants along the river.
2
Overpriced considering how dull the food was, and how little I received. Go elsewhere... you'll be seriously disappointed.
4
Stopped here for a quick bite in the afternoon that would last us until dinner time. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. Located in an area of Singapore (Clarke Quay) that is loaded with bars & restaurants along the river.
2
The food was very disappointing, we have been to Bali nine times and know the cuisine well. The chicken satay was stringy and chewy, the rest of the meal was poorly prepared. The service also was poor, staff lacked interest in their job and we sat with dirty plates uncleared for 30 minutes yet they were not busy.I certainly would advise you miss this establishment
4
Very nice food and staff at door and the servers were great and very attentive. Only the 'supervisor' seems a little hostile. Asked for a little bit of water for baby's milk, was told off abruptly 'we dont serve water!' For a restaurant that looks so posh and with that pricing and ++ taxes, i guess a supervisor who is more flexible would be an added asset. Besides that we enjoyed our meal and evening
3
The menu here isn't very big. Basically just a two-page menu. However, food here is nice enough. I had a basket of mixed food items, extra satay, fried egg toufu and spicy noodles. The noodles were a bit too soggy like and not at all spicy. Was told I had to request for it to be obviously spicy. The mixed basket had alot of food items there - some satay, a fried fish, grilled squid. The fish was just alright - a bit dry. The satay was delicious and so was the squid. Yummy. The fried toufu is tasty but the crispy egg bits wasn't alot. Overall food is good enough.Would be nice if there were more options like beef rendang.What wasn't good was the service.The first waitress that served us seemed irritable. Definitely not the service friendliness type. In fact, I became weary when she kept suggesting dishes when there were only 3 of us. Along the way, another waitress served us and she seemed like the boss. No smile at all. When I asked about the noodles she said I had to specially request for it to be spicy, even though the noodles was spicy noodles. Hmm ..I didn't pay for this meal so not sure how much it costed. If it's reasonably priced, I would come back here again if I have a craving for indonesian food
5
Been to this restaurant twice now. Food is delicious and we have received very quick service. Alcoholic drinks have been 2 for 1 or 1 for 1 as they like to say here. We have enjoyed the platter dishes and you can have non spicy or spicy food. The waitress warned me that dish I ordered was spicy spicy - the beef degan I think it was called. It was spicy and full of flavour but not hot. Or I didn't think so. Well worth a visit sg$ 120 ish for three of us.
3
The food was good yet each item came out on its own. The happy hour drinks tasted a bit watered down. The service was a little slow to start but then picked up. They gave me the wrong order to start but made it right quickly and food was tasty.
3
On approaching this restaurant you see about 3 or 4 staff trying to entice you in but once we were inside, everyone disappeared. Menus were delivered and then we were left to wait and wait - no excuse as we were the only occupied table.Menu has plenty of variety and meal quality and presentation were terrific.Could have been a memorable experience if only service was up to par
5
Enjoyed lunch so much we went back for dinner and it was just as good! Great value and staff lovely. Try the baked fish, it was amazing.
5
This was a first ever visit to a Indonesian Restraunt,we visited at lunchtime and they had a set menu deal on.
The food was really tasty, the staff were helpful and efficient.
The Restraunt was really clean.
What more could you possibly ask for .?
4
Very good Balinese cuisine on Clark Quay !
Nasi and lasi goreng, satay with very goods Singapore Sling, in the heart of Clark quay and his crowded streets by night.
5
If you are wanting Indonesian in Clark Quay this is the place. Great food and prices and fantastic drinks list too.
4
Great food & great value for singapore.. Traditional indonesian food with happy hour on some drinks.. Easy dinner out, on budget, tidy, tasty.. Quite, you can chat.. And have the non smoking option
4
Inside Clarke quay this restaurant prepare typical indo food . Service is fast and cordial. As first dish I ordered typical fried noodles with prawn and vegetables, with satay, French fries, egg ....and as dessert "cendal" with beans, mais , coconut, ice and a strange green string bean. Really good noodles and satay and really ....particular taste the dessert . Beer promotion : two tiger beer and pay just one....with a bill less than 50sgd.To be visited
3
I suppose in somewhere like Clarke Quay restaurants are always going to focus more on turnover than quality, but even so this was a bit poor. Firstly, the cheapest (SG$45) bottle of wine was not available so we had to go for the next up - SG$60, which is a bit steep. I had satay with was lukewarm, suggesting that rather than being freshly grilled it had just been warmed up. Then my main course came before we'd finished the starters, so I sat and watched it get cold while we waited for my wife's jumbo prawns. These showed up 10-15 mins later; they had obviously been freshly grilled. They were huge and really good - almost like lobster. This would have been a two star review if it hadn't been for the prawns
3
Nice looking restaurant in Clarke Quay, selling Indonesian style dishes. Had dinner here one Friday evening and decided to sit outside and enjoy the activity around Clarke Quay.Food was good, although not cheap and not huge portions. Service was OK - they were certainly very friendly before I sat down, afterwards the service was OK if a little perfunctory. However, it was very noisy outside, with all of the nearby restaurants and bars trying to out-do each other in the music department. When the Middle Eastern place next door started the belly dancing show in the street, it got even noisier!Would try it again, but probably not sitting on an outside table
4
Called in here for dinner after virtually 24 hrs travel from the UK (after several delayed flights and lost luggage). It was only 50 metres from our hotel, so it was about all we could stagger. As such we were after efficient service & tasty food (after 3 weeks of pub grub). As regular visitors to Indonesia we were full of hope, but had little expectation. Our hope was met & our expectations exceeded. Food was great - between us we had chicken curry, seafood fried noodles & fried rice with satays. Service was also prompt & efficient- which gave us a chance to eat& then go back to our hotel & begin to deal with our jet lag!Importantly the beer was on tap & cold!Worth trying
5
We enjoyed an impromptu dinner for 2. We feasted on Nasi Goring, a duck dish and a spicy curry one of the spiciest currys I have ever had but very delicious. The Nasi Goring was soo good I have been craving it ever since. The food was fresh and the service was good
5
Excellent value. The food was very fresh and tasty. Had a tasting dish with coconut rice. Totally yummy. Definitely recommend. reasonably priced. You can eat for around 20 to 30 Singapore dollars each.
4
Enjoyable meal at a reasonable price which is a bonus in its own right in Singapore. Mixed entree platter reccomended.
4
Had an excellent meal here,you can eat outside (rather noisy)or inside as we chose to do.Good choice on menu with very reasonable prices.
Staff were pleasant and friendly.
Would recommend and return.
4
Very good indonesian food, the nasi goreng was everything my mother-in-law had hoped for. Great location in a bustling street at Clarke Quay just off the river. We sat outside and enjoyed watching the world go by whilst eating very good food.
3
The food is fried and it is soaked with oil.
I think the place around klarke mostly for tourist.
You can find better quality in other places in the city.
Expensive.
Will not recommend to arrive.
Very noisy .

During our recce for a resto to host our girlfriend's Bachelorette Party, our contact at Bayang, Sharon was very attentive and patient in listening to and understanding our needs to design a special menu within a budget. On that visit we ordered the Ice Chendol With Avocado as a tasting sample, but when we asked for the bill, Sharon kindly waived it. This even before we conclude any deal! On the night itself, Sharon and her staff were very attentive. Although we occasionally made a ruckus during interval for games, the resto was fine with it. The special menu comprising of appetizer, soup, mains and dessert was aesthetically presented. And so delicious and tasty! Each person has her own lovely portion (without digging into a shared dish). We also got to meet the Head Chef, who is a very friendly jovial chap. Best of all the Bride-To-Be had a fabulous time! Awesome and amazing resto for Cuisine and Service and Price!!
5
Came here with my best friend bai yun and her boyfriend. We sat inside since none of us were smoking. Our ordered were rendang beef, appetizer platter, fried beef noodle and tahu telor. The food is great. For the cracker (Emping in Indonesia) they served w/ chili sauce. The staffs so friendly. Good ambience
1
Obviously had large party before we were sat. We Mistakenly thought this was because the place was good. We were sat after standing outside for ten minutes then ignored by the staff for the next hour as they moved tables around. After getting their attention we ordered our meals and our drinks arrived. 45mins later after watching another table sit then order and be served, we complained again where our did was. We saw our starters emerge only to be taken back again. My friend is a type one diabetic so I was getting angry at the sheer lack of service and customer focus. Our starters and Mains then hit the table in succession.food was a poor representation of Indonesia and it's cuisine. We will never go back to this restaurant. I do not recommend it. Awful
2
Crazy place.Wrong orders came out. Beers were over-charged. The Nasi was very ordinary although the chicken salad was very fine with wonderful flavours of lime leaf and chilli.Staff were a la Fawlty Towers. Moving furniture around by scraping tables and chairs the WHOLE time was just not only poor form it was completely out of touch with good manners and good customer management.To make matters worse the obnoxiously loud and foul language emanating from the speakers of a restaurant/bar several shops away was disgraceful with expletives galore. It not only drowned out the conversation anywhere outside but also in the space where the inside tables were located - it should be outlawed.Give it a miss
4
if you come to clarke quai you took the right decision for getting a lot off different cusines and great food.today we enjoyed first time balinese cuisine. for us a mixture from asian and indian style. we took first the appetizer platter and after this as main course bbq seafood platter.for us tasted really good! staff very friendly and the food came fas
5
We always enjoy eating here when we come to Singapore. The location suits us, food is good, drinks (especially happy hour ) are fine, service always good and prompt. Prices reasonable for Clarke Quay
3
I found this place when we strolled around Clarke Quay area. The restaurant is cozy considering the location. The food was pretty good and the people were nice. However, I don't think the quality of the restaurant justified the price. We paid about 110 SGD for 4 persons without alcohol. I know it's Clarke Quay area so everything is overpriced. So would I recommend it? based on the price, probably not. There must be cheaper Indonesian restaurants in Singapore
4
Went here with friends. The food is yummy yes, but we found it a little bit pricey. We paid 180sgd for just 1 platter of seafood. But well this is Singapore what do you expect. So far the experienced is ok.
5
My wife and I lived in Indonesia for 10 years so love the food and know what is good and is not. This was our second visit and the food was as good the second time around. We had the Gado Gado, which was unique in that it had some tempura kind of veggies as well as the traditional makings of the dish. We also ordered the mixed seafood BBQ which was cooked to perfection and not overcooked which is often the problem. Tiger draft is always buy one get one free. Prices are higher than if you bought in Bali or Jakarta but reasonable for Singapore
4
This is a decent Indonesia restaurant' nothing fancy but good standard food with good service and reasonable prices. We tried Nasi Gorang and the Surf and Turf combo, both very good
5
We had an excellent Indo-Balinese meal in the Clarke Quay area chock full of restaurants that did not seem to have the rating this one did. And we were not disappointed. The restaurant had outdoor and indoor seating, and we chose to eat outdoors. I had a combo plate with crispy duck, a vegetable curry, greens, and rice; my husband had a combo as well, but with lamb. We recommend this restaurant
4
We picked this place due to our love of Balinese food and we were not disappointed. The food was fantastic. Great seafood.. The service was very friendly and quick. It was a great reminder of how good Balinese food is. Thank you for a great night. Please try it if you are in the area
4
One of the nicer restaurants in Clarke Quay. Inside is nicely decorated and peaceful. Good starters and mains, portions sizes could be a touch larger though. If you want Balinese food, there is lots of choice
5
I will definitely comeback to bayang... I loved the food! Esp. CHILI CRAB. The manager Bianca is very friendly and accommodating. She recommend the best of bayang .. We will always be back!
4
My favourite dish Bebek betutu, had it 5yrs ago and it still taste just as yummy after so long. I find the price to be ok, thought the portion for the Kangkung with sambal can be a little smaller or at least give patron a choice for size of the portion. Most people have vegetable as a side dish after all
3
The service was average and inattentive throughout the evening. Clarke quay is a great place for a evening stroll and people watching.
4
Fresh, Asian fusion food. We sat outdoors and were treated to belly-dancing entertainment from the place next door without being too close! fast, friendly, cheap (for Singapore) and 2 for 1 beers. What's not to like!
2
No tap water provided. Still water served in bottles. Juices served from cordials. Not fresh. Poor service speed. Good service consideration to customer request. 1) Appetizer Platter- 3 pieces each: spring rolls, grilled prawn, fish cake (?) that did not taste like fish cake, satay stick- Grilled prawn and satay sticks were reasonable- Tasteless spring rolls and fish cake2) Sambal Kangkung- too watery- tasted like chilli kangkong- barely any sambal flavor 3) Ikan Bakar/ Fried Fish- not freshly cooked fish- no flavor- there was special sweet sauce on it? What? O_o- just put it in your mouth and eat it since it's there- crispy4) Bebek Betutu (Duck with Balinese spices in Banana leaf)- so dry- just like the fried fish. Just put it in your mouth and eat it since it's there- looked better than it tasted- underwhelming compared to the true Balinese flavor5) Beef Rendang (the only SAVIOR of the whole meal out of everything ordered)- YE
3
The food was good although the duck was very dry, the drinks adequate but the cocktails are not as good as at Chijmes and the service was OK. I thought that value for money was average; we have certainly eaten better for less at other restaurants. Overall it was OK but not great
5
This is a nice Indonesian restaurant in Clarke Quays. While it is quite pricey as is most restaurants in Clarke Quay, the food is very, very good. If you are not a fan of the local speciality crabs, try the pepper prawns. This restaurant serves an absolutely wonderful pepper prawn dish. This restaurant also has the usual Indonesian specialities , like Beef Rendang and other curries. They also do take away and the staff are friendly and helpfu
5
Overall, our dining experience was fantastic. The food was well presented, well priced and tasted great. The service was also very good. The only detriment was the loud music from nearby bars but sitting outside also provided some entertainment via people watching. Overall it did not negatively influence our meal as we still were able to hear each other and talk with ease, even enjoyed some Taylor Swift during dessert. Would recommend this location for dinner/drinks with friends
5
My husband and I had dinner here during his short stay. There were lots of US Navy sailors and marines at bars across from this restaurant, and those bars were pretty loud. Nonetheless we were able to enjoy nice (not quiet) candle lit dinner. I wish we had gone in a little earlier just so we had more time. The food was great, and their price range was reasonably set for Clarke Quay, I believe. Recommended for a date night!
4
This was tasty, interesting and well presented Balinese food. It was freshly cooked and tasted delicious. The service was warm, friendly and efficient enough. The restaurant is in the heart of the Clarke Quay network of streets filled with bars and restaurants. I feel sorry for this place: opposite are some of the worst fast food outlets imaginable not just because they looked as if they could have been set in any part of the world but because the fast food staff thought it amusing to play volume wars of USA rap music with videos not designed for a relaxing evening meal. Do to be put off by this: Bayang is good, and good value for money because the food is quality, not, I repeat, not overpriced as others have suggested
3
Boss wants treat us for dinner so I suggested this authentic Indo Bali restaurant which located at Clark Quay . There have indoor and outdoor sitting, we chose indoor sitting but it was hot, we not not sure it's too many spot lights or the air corn is not strong enough.  The Food are delicious, especially they have a lot of difference homemade chili sauces for different dishes. But the rendang chicken is too salty.Actually Not much variety here. The price for food is not cheap, i think the cheapest dish is SGD12 and the beverage is min SGD4.00. They do not provide drinking water. We ordered 2 bottles of Vittle mineral water ( SGD7.00 / bottle) to share. There also have combo set for 3-4 persons and combination set(SGD68) for individual(About SGD28). Actually we like all the dishes we ordered, my boss said it's good Indonesian food, good chilli and he said he will come again. Me too 
4
Hadn't been in town long, but liked the idea of eating Indonesian.Menu items were not cheap, but the food was very nice.Early on a staff member offered us crackers as she was walking around. Wasn't happy to see them on the bill at the end, as the way she did it implied that they were free - don't like ploys like that.Overall the experience was good, but pricey as stated
3
Foods was well presented, but the team started winding up the cafe at 10.30pm when the rest of the centre seemed alive which was a shame.
The food was tasty and even hotter than expected which was nice!
4
The location is very touristy in Clarke Quay but the food and service were excellent. We loved it so much we went back a second time.
3
had a team lunch here with the colleagues. we also asked the staff to keep a birthday cake for us to be served after lunch ended. they gladly helped and even added a surprisingly cheerful birthday song while serving the birthday cake to our elated colleague
4
A group of four of us went here on the second night in town. After a disappointing first night's dining, this place was just the right antidote. The service was great, the food fresh, well cooked, good portions and reasonable prices. We shared grilled platters for entrees and also the mains. One of the party was not happy with her BBQ'ed king prawns as there was only two (but very large) and she said they were not fresh, but thawed frozen prawns. Otherwise all the others were great. Drinks a bit expensive, but then, not too bad for Singapore. $13 for a large glass of good aussie red not too bad really. All in all, a very pleasant dining experience. Highly recommended
4
After checking in at the nearby Swissotel we made our way to Clarke Quay and found the Bayang. Was quite busy which is always a good sign and took the plunge. Whilst choosing our meals the ice cold Tiger beer was sublime. Just the right temperature to combat the Singapore humidity. Ordered quite a mixed selection to share between 6. Everything was well presented and the staff very helpful with our food selection. Some were a bit of a gamble but everything was tasty even if some were a bit spicy. The food all seemed fresh and the seafood was excellent. Would definitely go here again
3
Ordered the complete grill platter (SGD 68, portion for 3), which was quite nice and tasty. The seafood & chicken were not of the freshest quality, but it's still very good.Only problem I have with the restaurant is the price. I ate in a group of three and we ended up having to pay SGD 141.Also, this place used to be quite classy. Now the ambiance has deteriorated quite a bit; the walls & furnitures look old
4
Arrived at Clark Quay at 9pm wanting an affordable meal. Did the rounds and found most venues quite expensive. Stumbled across Bayang as it offered a set meal and 1 for 1 mugs of beer. Chose the S$10.90 chicken meal x 3. Wow. The beer was cold. The service was great and the meal....excellent. Highly recommended. As a side issue, crisps are delivered to your table before the meal which are $3 (not mentioned) but very nice.
4
We enjoyed a good meal at Bayang. Mixed starter with satays, prawns, speing rolls. then mains of Beef Rendang and Crispy duck together with Indonesian special fried rice. the quality of food was very good and service also good. The restaurant was only about a quarter full when we ate there although quite early (around 7-30pm). You can sit inside or outside and people watch.By Clarke Quay standards very good value too
5
Went there last night and was blown away by the customer service and the flavours of the food. An excellent food and wine menu plenty to choose from. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable . Well located in the Clarke Quay area. Will return awa
4
Believe it our not you can eat outdoors at Bayang and enjoy the air-conditioning. Yes, this is the famous air-conditioned streets of Singapore's Clarke Quay. The music was loud, the lights bright and the variety of food on offer seemed endless. We opted for our local friend's recommendation of Bayang for a touch of Indonesian.The Combi Bakar had a terrific fish as the centrepiece plus calamari and plenty of meat on sticks smothered in peanut sauce which are so central to the Indonesian, and to a large extent also the Singapore cuisine. A Cap Chai Goreng vegetable selection went down well, as did the jug of local draft Tiger beer.Does it come cheap? Well lets be honest Singapore is not a place to look for inexpensive dining, as is found in other South East Asia destinations. However, we did get the bonus of enjoying the excellent belly-dancer from the neighbouring Persian Restaurant who danced outside to entertain and draw in more customers
