This is good cafe for hangout. It is good for breakfast. It is a good cafe to chill at, on a weekend afternoon. Located near Toast box.

I highly recommend their Crab Meat Pasta Aglio Olio Olio. Surprising unique dish.
Heavenly delicious!
Generous crab meat!
Definitely a MUST order dish!!!

I like the breakfast item, fish & chips were normal though, reasonably priced. Drinks were decent standards too. It is a good cafe to chill at, on a weekend afternoon.
