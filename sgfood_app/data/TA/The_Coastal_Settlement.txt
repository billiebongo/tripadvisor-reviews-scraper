Love the environment , tried their pizza was really good , aglio olio was good as well, weekday is a better time to be there , no queue
4
Friendly place for gathering, the ambience is cozy and comfortable but the food is slightly overpriced, overall still good.

Great old school nostalgia while having a great all day brunch and sipping your cuppa. Wonderful tasting culinary spreads from portobello mushrooms to steaks. don't forget to try their milkshakes!

Loved the ambiance, decor and the beautiful lush green surrounded the restaurant. A very relaxing space away from the city bustle.
An interesting place to dine.

The Coastal Settlement is very much a place to go for the vibe. At least for breakfast, cannot comment for dinner.Cast your mind back, way back, to when design was curved, men wore corduroy and sported sideburns, phones were orange and still attached to the wall and inefficient vespas were the coolest way to get around. And then add the music from that era.THAT is the essence and charm of The Coastal Settlement.Food wise, well, breakfast was alright. Average offerings, standard choices, nothing that blew me away.It has a large outdoor seating area that is dog friendly which makes sense given the surroundings and access to walking trails at Changi

Found in the remote part of Singapore, its a drive away, but its really worth it. It feels like an old home converted into a restaurant. So much nostalgic momentos, furniture, even old cars and motor bikes are on display. Its a blast from the past. The huge glass windows and high ceilings make for an even bigger looking restaurant. The food is nice, you get the best of local and non local. So it really is good when you have guests with different preferences. And of course the staff are warm and friendly. Its definitely worth to go back. As for the dessert - i'd skip the red velvet and go for the lava cake

The Coastal Settlement is the place to go for breakfast. Our favorite is the avocado smash with eggs and smoked salmon on toast. Their breakfast menu is served before 10:30am and has a decent choice, including good coffee. We haven't yet been for other meals, but the menu looks fabulous!As for the setting - the restaurant has lovely nostalgic antiques throughout, and a fabulous bar with Chinese mirrored panels. The place has superb ambiance, and there is both indoor and outdoor seating
5
We stopped for lunch here as this is a dog friendly restaurant. We were promptly served by our waitress Jocelyn, who provided excellent services and very good advice on the choice of food, and explaining what the dish consisted of, as we wanted to know the specific's of what was in the dish, she was very helpfulFood was great and there is a real nice vibe at this restaurant, its certainly a place that we will go back to.And I would recommend a visit to try out the food, and the vibe

Dinner date. Ordered the Fish and Chips, Wagyu Beef Cubes and the Smoked Salmon Rosti. And for after dinner sweet pleasure, we had a vanilla shake. Fish and Chips, very good job. Served with a side of wasibi dressed greens. Chips came out as if they were made at home and were chunky yet had a good crisp to them. Fish was well fried in decent oil. They used a good fish, snapper, I think. Slight problem was that the fish wasn't all that fresh and was a bit fishy even with generous dosing of freshly squeezed lemon juice. 7/10Wagyu Beef Cubes. Outstanding. Beef cubes were pan seared yet were still moist and tender. Served with garden greens and balsamic dressing. 8/10Rosti, very decent. Pretty big portion. Rosti had lots of crispy bits. It could have been seasoned a wee bit more but because it was served with smoked salmon pieces and sausage that oversight could be overlooked. Nearing the end, the rosti was rather oily and greasy. This dish was competent. 6.75/10Vanilla Milk Shake. Pedestrian. Didn't even use good ice cream. At S$8++ you'd expect better quality ice cream but alas... 5/10Service. Could be better. Not very proactive in topping up our water. Ambiance. First rate. Something different and very eclectic. Won't spoil it for you. Go and see. Perfect place to come to right at the end of an afternoon thunderstorm. Greenery and deco are otherworldly

First time to this place tucked away in Changi Village. Love the retro ambience ... What we loved..Great location to just chill with family and friends..Good service ...What needs improvement ...Even thou we ordered two coffee , an apple crumble and coastal wings...the food was not to expectations.The coffee was not warm..tasted good thou.The apple crumble was not what you wld expect if you are used to enjoying them in UK. It hardly had any crumbles .. we had to ask for some seperate so we can actually have apple crumble ...We also had the Coastal wings@ Marinated chicken wings .. Very disappointed as the wings were tasteless and not fully cooked..The food is pricey but if the quality was good wld pay for it.. I wld rate it good as it's a great place and love to come back but hope the food ordered next time round will be much much better .

Nice relax ambience tucked away in a quiet part of Changi village. Lots of retro fittings. Food is ok. Servings are large. Price around $20++ per item. Can be a bit chilly if you come in t-shirt and burms.
5
Wonderful al fresco place surrounded by dense greens. Great place for a relaxed Kronenbourg Blanc or for a brunch. Burger was very good and of course Kronenbourg on tap is always great.

On the daughter's request, went to TCS for dinner. Without a doubt, the antique Morris and VW Beetle that were placed outside the the restaurant are eye-catchers. However, the interior setting is really "chapalang" with items ranging from a antique white BMW to chairs, posters, bicycles and wooden windows. The lack of a central theme in its decor somehow gave a good quaint feel. Service was very prompt. The daughter ordered beef short ribs and truffle fries while I went for just a starter of mussels and clams. The short ribs were tender and nicely marinated. The truffle fries were superbly done. However, the pot of mussels and clams was very disappointing. The clams and mussels were definitely not fresh and tasteless while the gravy was somewhat weak and bland. Price-wise, it was overly expensive for the quality of food served.

My wife and I brought my nephew to dinner here one Sunday. It was our first visit here although we have read good reviews about this place. I read about the popular signature dishes here like rosti with smoked salmon, wagyu beef pizza etc.We ordered a seafood aglio olio, a wagyu beef pizza and a fish and chips to share. (For some reason I forgot to order the rosti which I was looking forward to).The food quality was good overall but not exciting enough to a 'wow'. The XO sauce seafood aglio olio came with fresh ingredients though the pasta was a bit on the dry side. The padta was cooked just right wth al dente.The fish and chips was good too especially the chips. The fish (Halibut) was fresh enough but it came in only one smallish piece.:-(Lastly, the wagyu beef pizza was the least favourite for us. I find the pizza's thin crust, though usually preferred for good pizza, was overdone such that it became rather hard to bite through. The wagyu beef pieces were cooked in a sweet sauce (similar to some Asian style cooking) which did not blend well with pizza in my opinion. However, the portion was very generous with many pieces of tender beef.The restaurant sits in a rustic environment with nice greenery outside and many antique furnishings inside like old bikes, poster etc. I would still return for other dishes there
5
Came here for a romantic dinner with friends. Nice ambience and very stunning decorations. Clean environments (all decorations are well dusted). But do not try to sit at the outter area without mosquito repellent after sunsets. You will be feeding mosquitoes more than feeding yourself with foods. Taking photos of the decorations are allowed but not the other clients. Its a strict policy at this restaurant.
5
I went there with friends who recommended the place and I loved it. This former commercial( I think) building was transformed into a funky restaurant/cafe with an eclectic interior. The food was delicious and not too expensive. You can sit inside or outside and if you're lucky you can see monkeys play around in the trees in the adjoining little park. Bring some time because you can easily spend a few hours there just lounging around if you feel like it
3
LocationYou got to drive to visit this place. Located near Changi Village. Ambiance is great! Nothing to compare in the city area. It has a rustic feel, the decorations will make you go back to the 60's or 70's.Service Nothing special. In fact, the server pass on an insulting comment when i finished one whole fish.FoodGood food. Portion is big. The menu is a good mix of western and asian
3
We have visited often in the past but definitively the quality has declined. My usual Wagyu was more sweet than tasty, the fish and chips has batter that is more flour than flavors, the laksa gravy appears diluted (it was late dinner). Truffle fries remains good and service is attentive as usual Don't think we will return too soon
4
Great place for brunch in a charming ambience. Tucked away from the city hustle and bustle, this place has all things of the past. From well preserved furniture to old cars. The menu is good not the best. Great tcc coffee and and some creative desserts . A little walk around the restaurant while the food is prepared is perfect to prepare the taste buds and the stomach.

Heard about this place for quite some time, with many friends posting their visits on their social media accounts.Finally, went there ourselves over the weekend to check if this is really as good as what some had wrote on their reviews.1st Impression: Ambience - Place is quite oldie from the outside, which is what we liked. Once inside, the place dimmed considerably due to the lightings. At the right corner, which is where we sat, it was the dimmest as there was the least glass windows to allow sunlight to get in. It wasn't bad though. It reminded me of my grandma's big old kitchen at the back of the house, with decors to match too.Service - We were greeted upon entry and were promptly shown to our table along with menus. Took awhile to determine if it was table service or counter service though but it was alright.Food menu:Price - Price is on the higher side but it was expected for such a restaurant. And since it was our first time here, we didn't know what to expect. We ordered a soup, and 2 mains to share between, myself, wife and our youngest one.Soup - Wild mushroom soup came in a mess tin on a wooden board with 3 slices of bagguette. The bread was crispy and the soupy was pretty good. The youngest one hoarded it all to herself throughout the entire meal and it made for great dipping with the baguette, the pizza and the waffle.Mains - (1)The wagyu beef pizza's portion was big and it totally took us by surprise. To say it is a pizza is almost incorrect. It looked more like a huge plate of stir fried wagyu slices on a big piece of crispy naan (yes, the indian 'prata'). It was a pleasant surprise, since we didn't expect so much beef. Taste was ok (and that's a big plus since we are very picky eaters) and my youngest actually took to the beef and ate a lot. (2)The chicken with waffle came with fries, and similarly, it came in big portions too. By this time, we realised that the pizza and soup for the 3 of us would have suffice. Taste-wise, the chicken was a disappointment. (ok, as I said, we are picky eaters, the taste is ok, just not great like how we were surprised by the wagyu - I think it may be a little unfair since the wagyu raised the bar pretty high). The waffle was really good though and the fries... a very interesting taste. It seems it was sprinkled with some truffle oil perhaps as it has a really nice fragrance to it.I had a beer and it was priced at $9, which I think was ok. But I do realise this is not the smartest way to eat here. Hint: a bigger group, sharing a few mains and a big tower of beer would have been more economical, if you are those who values smart spending.All-in-all, a good experience, and yes, we may be back to test a few more dishes to see if we can be hit by surprises. And no, we will not be ordering the wagyu pizza and the chicken w/waffle again. Once over with the surprise, I wouldn't really order them again for their taste. (they will have to taste really heavenly for me to want a second go at them
2
The ambience was a good place to chill out but the food was subpar for the prices you are paying. Waste of money for the mains but worth for the drinks
5
A very nice and cozy place for family. I love the environment there. The food is good especially the big breakfast. The waffle also good.
4
Discovered this as we stayed in the nearby hotel. Nice hangout with quaint ambience, the drinks were decent and it's great place to sit in the afternoon, read a book or have conversations with loved ones. Take note of parking spaces if you need to drive here.
4
For those working in Loyang there are limited options for lunch meetings, Coastal settlement is one of the better ones.Get there early parking is limited on site and the public carpark is also small, beyond that hope it's too hot for the Traffic wardens to be on patrol.The menu is fusion and most of it is fairly solid, although quality can vary. Portions are hearty so take care not to over order.There are some real gems on the menu as an occasional treat, like the spam fries.Service is good and can recommend it as a decent lunch venue
4
Tasty food, nothing to die for though, in far flung part of Singapore's Changi area. Accessible only by cars, it harks settings back to the 70's-80's era, making it a delightful place for friends and family to gather to reminisce about the good old days. The Wagyu beef and mushroom pizza is delightful, while the truffles fries is a must! For those born during the time of walkman, pacman, vinyl records, bettle etc, many of the vintage items on display will surely bring a fond memory or two, while tucking into some tasty food. Not the cheapest meals.
3
Have been to this restaurant a few times as it is quite a nice unique venue for casual business lunches. It is a bit remote to get to so you definitely need transportation to get here however parking space is very limited. Prices are somewhat higher than your average restaurant in the area, I would say closer to hotel pricing I.e $28 for burger, $24 for handmade pizza. Food quality, tastes and portion are appropriate to pricing and quite substantial. Menu options is sufficient with both local (beef rendang) and western options. It was rather late when we got to the restaurant so it was fairly empty with another 3other tables occupied. Music was blaring too loudly for table conversations so we requested they turn it down. ( which they didn't) .. it was about 15mins later that they did do so perhaps maybe the server recalling our request eventually or someone else complaining. Food took about 30mins but were served at the same time for all 6 of us. However to our disgust the toppings for on the rice of my colleague's beef rendang dish was crawling with ants! We brought this to the attention of the server and she took it back to the kitchen to be replaced the rice without any toppings but offered no apology nor expressed remorse. A bit disappointing at the lack of customer care and concern.
4
This place is hard to get to without a car, but please make a reservation before heading down because the crowd will surprise you.Food and drink prices are on the high mid-range, especially for the location.However, the environment and good food makes the trip worth it. The decor are mainly collections by the owner over the years
3
The ambience is good for small groups gathering. Food is OK or perhaps a little above average. I enjoyed truffle fries very much. Otherwise the fusion dishes were OK. Had the xo prawn pasta and salami pizza plus truffle fries. But the price was about $80.
4
Well worth the 30-minute taxi to Changi. Reserve in advance as queues for tables can be long.Very nice environment in small wooded park, interior "Singapore hipster", mid century modern with relaxed seating inside and out. Nice for families with space for strollers and small fry to run around.Great menu w wide food selection. Coming from different time zones, we ordered waffles and coffee, omelettes, as well as burgers and fries and a char kway teow. Service was a bit slow, but it was busy and pleasant to hang out. Overall very good, followed by a relaxing walk down to Changi village and waterfront
4
Came here for lunch. It's approx. 14 mins' walk from the Civil Service Club opposite the Changi Village Hotel. It's a quiet place to chill and have a meal. Food is pretty ok. Serves both local and western cuisines. The deco has a very oldies feel. There's both indoor and outdoor sitting.
3
Food is not something to shout about but if you want to get away from city lights and dine in a quiet setting, this is a good place to do so.
4
The food is great, although you are going to need a car/Uber to get there. Definitely recommended to visit at least once.
5
Pleasant quick service, lovely staff, great food. Good place to spend the evening. Especially after a flight home. Welcoming environment. Nice relaxing place to chill out as well.
3
This is a quiet place in the Northeastern suburbs of Singapore. The restaurant has greenery around, an open backyard with a swing and an interior decorated with antiques and vintage vehicles.
We had already had dinner and stopped here for dessert. The desserts were ok.
3
Great ambience with vintage decor tucked away at quiet corner of Changi. Inaccessible for customers without own transport. We were disappointed by the food because it was ordinarily average. We arrived at around 7pm. The first waiter (chinese middle age man) we met at the entrance asked whether we made advance reservation. We didn't and he informed us that we have to leave by 9pm. The same waiter was observed to be a little pushy as he arrange customers to share table even though there were plenty of empty tables around. We ordered salmon mac and cheese, sausage rosti, crispy marinated chicken wing & truffle fries. The nicest food we ate was the truffle fries
5
 Tucked away in a forest at loyang, a cosy little restaurant, unknown to many, is the costal settlement. Tcs is very nice...The ambience of the restaurant is very vintage and cosy. There is music playing in the background. To all vintage car/ vespa lovers, it is the suitable place as it features 3 vintage cars and 2 vespas. Although the food is a little costly, it is worth an experience. i highly recommend you, the one who is reading this, to visit tc
3
Went for Saturday brunch. Nobody ever picked up the call on the weekdays, got us worried a bit. The place is full of antiques and old-schooled furnitures which are very cool. Unfortunately they forgot our orders and served the dishes cold so we sent it back and the manager sent us complimentary truffles fries for compensation but they forgot about our second rounds of coffee again after our food arrived. Overall it is a great place for gatherings but the food are too sweet (there were sweet onion chutney between the bread and the eggs plus the Vinaigrette dressing were way too sweet) also avoid the peak hours so you will get your food hot and quick
4
We visited this quaint hide away restaurant near Changi village for dinner and found it to be a relaxing place to unwind and chill. The retro music and decor added to the unique ambience, the burger I had was juicy and delicious. Service was adequate and professional , with a huge outdoor and indoor seating area , the outlet was quite busy with families last night. We will come back again in the future to get away from the bustle of the city , to chill with a cold beer and to enjoy the music of yester years 
3
Lunch with friends from the same era as the shop's memorabilia. Food quality was so so for price. Service was not the most attentive. Staffs were most interested in the counter than customers. Had to walk to the counter to tell someone I found a hair in my food. Wasn't even any verbal or token of apology, just umm and took my food away and came back with a new one. The only saving grace is they don't seem to mind if you stay the entire afternoon.
3
Amidst our Pokemon Go adventure, we found this hidden gem. This casual restaurant is adorned with vintage relics of old Singapore in the 40s to 70s. Service is friendly and food is above expectation in terms of quality. It's a definite must if you are in Changi Village area
3
Nice environment to chill. Price for f &b is in the higher side. Service is fast. Can consider for a place to relax
3
Food was average quality and a tad too small In serving. I particularly enjoyed the decor of the place which is rustic . Overpriced for the size and quality.
5
It's silent. Not much of human movements. Perfect for a date, casual meet ups with friends. It's not pricey,so no worries about it being overcharged for such a cool setting.
4
My first visit to this place.The ambience is great. Old school deco tastefully done. The food was good too. My friend raved about the Truffle Fries and Duck Curry. I had the Rosti Sausage. We love the sauce that came with the wings too. The only thing i prefer to be better is for the water served to be colder. Just a personal preference though.If you drive, be prepared to park at the adjacent carpark. Limited lots
2
Walked in at 20:30, ordered the Wild Mushroom soup which was ok, but before I had finished the soup the waiter without notice brought my main course of Grilled Lamb Chops with buttered oat meal which I thought was rather rude. By the time I finished the starter the main course was now lukewarm. The bed of oat meal which was rather sweet ended up as a brown unattractive sludge ☹️ on the plate, would have preferred mash or a bed of spinach.I asked the waiter what time the kitchen closes and he replied 22:30. The time of my credit receipt was 21:37 hours 
5
Been here several times. Tried almost everything on their menu. Nothing disappoints! Its a tad on the expensive side, but with the type of quirky surroundings, amazing offering of food and excellent service, I think it's worth it. Love this place and I cannot get enough of the food and the atmosphere
4
I was here recommended by a friend. The setting of this place is like an abandoned warehouse but cleaned up for a restaurant. It's even has an old BMW car inside together with some bicycles and old sewing machine and other old cabinets. The foods are ok and service is good. This place also has a free valet service.
4
Was surprise Singapore had this cozy nature green place to hang out. The area is called Changi Village. Quite interesting interior where east meet west. Plenty outdoor seating for smoker. Fully recommended For traveller had a long transit hour in Singapore to visit here to wind down instead of going to the city.
4
Fourth time to this place and still loving it. Have always sat outside for the chill vibes (this stunning cafe sits beside a forest and has its own garden), but decided to sit indoors this time cos it was way too hot outdoors! This place is gorgeous inside and really cosy. I appreciate that the seats are not close to each other, and the place is not too brightly lit. I would in fact come back to this cafe just for the awesome vibes.The food was just okay though. Not the cheapest ($24 for the big breakfast and $15 for the churros) but I guess the prices were quite reasonable considering the awesome place. Would definitely come back soon!
5
This is one restaurant that was introduce by a friend who told me this is MUST GO when you are in changi area. Great hangout area (indoor & outdoor). I always love the outdoor area especially the natures breeze. I had the wild mushroom soup with truffle oil, French Fries, & a latte.... Just great for a sunday morning breakfast...
5
Secluded and situated amidst lush greenery, coastal settlement provided the perfect getaway within the city! We loved escaping to this 'ulu' styled cafe and enjoyed a hearty brunch on a sunny Saturday. Relaxing experience !
4
Came on sat afternoon 1pm. Crowd was light so not too rowdy or messy. Had the big breakfast, kimchi omelette & spam fries. Some minor imperfections but overall was a good experience. Bill comes up to be about $70
4
visited for weekend brunch in retro decor with garden. spacious n comfortable, nice place for chit chat. food items are average urban cafe menu....but what we ordered were delicious. my egg benedict was perfectly cooked, satisfied. dishes were not too big portion, so that we could go for dessert.
4
We stumbled upon this place while my hubby was jogging in the neighborhood. When we arrived, we fell in love with the dreamy, fairy-like atmosphere of the place. While some reviews may have given this place a rather bad rep, I beg to differ.We ordered beef rendang, mussels and clams, hokkien noodles, cheese burger and curry chicken... and its thumbs up for all of them. Yummy. Also, the portions are big, so if you are not too hungry -- we recommend you share.The items used to decorate the place are from another era... and we had fun scrutinizing everything. Downside? The churros deserts are only so-so, we have tasted better ones.
3
Retro decor and rather eclectic but won't visit unless I'm in the area. If it wasn't for a company off site at the nearby hotel followed with drinks at coastal settlement, i probably would not visit. Calamari was good with the drinks and we had good company. So all in all, a good experience if you are in the area visiting Changi chapel or the east of Singapore. If you drive and want to get away from the usual urban crowds, this is a good place. Takes you back in time and easy to forget yourself there with good company, drinks and some food. Almost makes you feel like you are at a resort
3
Came here for lunch but, unfortunately, they did not have beef rendang on the menu. We had the prawn aolio, nasi lemak and pappadam sambal. The latter dish was actually the best, as it was freshly fried and the chlli lime went well with it.The prawn pasta came with three large, firm and fresh prawns but the pasta itself was overcooked and a little mushy. The nasi lemak was not too bad, though the ikan bilis was a little past its freshness date and was very hard. I liked the generous portion of sambal chilli.Service was iffy, perhaps due to the weekday lunchtime crowd, and staff scuttled by without cat hing your eye or even noticing waving hands. Guess we will give this place a miss unless they have beef rendang, as there are other eateries nearby
4
Nice environment, spacious, decorated with old things as a warehouse. We went on Friday evening so it's crowded. We tried wagyu beef (awesome), baby back ribs, fish and chips, pasta (not very good) and pizzas with wines. Foods are pricey but I feel it's worth it. But I'd rather go next time during weekdays then I can have much more quiet and cozy environment.
4
Their grilled baby red snapper with lemongrass is very fresh and tasty @ SGD42+. Order this upon sitting as it takes about 25mins to prepare. Freshly squeezed juices and good strong cappuccino. Truffle and spam fries, wagyu cubes and wagyu beef pizza (thin & crispy), fish & chips, all large portions! Only downside is it takes at least 30mins drive from central, really far out beyond upper Changi/Loyang. Free parking which is ideal ;
4
Visited this place 3 times in less than 2 weeks. First with a friend for catch up session, second time with just the kids and third for family brunch. Food is pretty good, love the pizza and salads. Did not try the local food but saw that many had ordered the rice dishes. Love the ambience and showed the kids some of the stuff we grew up with in the 70s and 80s. Staff ratio is small, but they are not rude, just overworked. They are friendly and attentive when there is not much of a crowd. Not easy to access if no car though. Valet parking available on weekends. Although crowded on weekends the space is huge enough without feeling that all the tables are too close to each other. Will definitely go back.
3
The restaurant is interesting with antique bits and bobs around and a wonderful outside area that you can sit at with dogs (or after cycling) looking onto GREEN :)We got friendly efficient service but both times we have been (once for brunch and once for dinner) we have had one of the meals too terrible to eat and the others delicious!?I think this could be easily fixed if the chef tasted the food? Ribs were nothing but a plate of fat and grease..... then the curry was wonderful! Other time chicken waffle had a beautiful crispy outer but inner was slimly, fatty skin? Pizza was paper-thin and wonderful!Difficult to get this review out as the meals differed so much
4
Granted the service levels can be a little erratic at times but the variety of the menu, quality of the food and the location mask this well... Good value comparatively, overall one of the family's favourite eateries
3
Hm... I think I would give 3 stars only. Its a nice place for chill out for a tea or coffee but not for foods. Foods are average in fact and you can have the same kind of foods anywhere in Singapore, nothing special. The deco in the rest. is unique and antique furniture all over the rest. The staff service is not so well trained, I mean some are ok and some are not really pay attention to customers request. Recommend to go after busy lunch hours
5
This place is within the Changhi limits and is located within the forested area of Changhi. I did not see many taxi's or a taxi spot but one can hire a taxi for this place. It is a great place as it is a heritage building turned into a restaurant and a bar. The interiors have antiques, old empty drinking bottles, scooters, car. Food and drinks in this relaxed environment feels great. Quality of food is super yet prices of drinks is not expensive. It is not very crowded so ideal for a date, for a getaway with family and friends
5
My first time visit despite hearing many feedback & recommendation to check this place out. The venue is not easily accessible unless you have a car or if you live near by the east. Amazingly the food was fantastic & tasty, portions are generous, desserts & coffee were good too.This is a nice place for a chill out and catching up with old friends
4
I really enjoyed "the coastal settlement". It is different from the usual very packed Singapore restaurants. There is a nice feeling of space and the dense rainforest surroundings give the place a special ambiance.The food was great. Brunch food at its best- interesting, tasty and decadent. The Fried Chicken and Waffles really stand out but all the dishes we had at the table were great. For dessert we tried the apple cheesecake which was light and delightful.My only issue with this place (as so many other places in Singapore) is that the quality of service is average at best. Very difficult to get a waiter's attention and usually it required wildly waving hands...But still recommended and i will be back
4
This place would be nice for families, but can be quite a noisy ambience for dating. The food was great. The service can be improved - serving took a while, and a few times when we requested for service, they nodded but did not come back.
1
Had to pour water myself. Had to take ketchup and chilli myself. I asked for a freaking bowl of white rice FOUR times and it takes more than twenty minutes (kid was hungry). Mains are at $40..c'mon are you kidding me??? The restaurant is located at the far end ulu side of changi.Please AVOID THIS PLACE
5
I really love this place - hidden from the city's noise, vintage settings & lots lots of green.Their brunch menu is the best in my view.Friendly service.Went there many times - as a couple, with my entire family and with my friends.There is a little playground for the kids at the backyard
4
Just have to bring my family to this little hidden gem after I discovered it by accident. Hidden away from the hustle and bustle of the city in the East of the island, you can enjoy nature and good food all at one go.The Fish and Chips were highly recommended as the batter is both fresh and light giving the freshness of the halibut it much deserved.The rendang is to die for and the portion is huge too. It just melts in your mouth. There are good variety for one to choose from, whether you prefer western or local delights.The desserts are 2 thumbs up and my fussy 9 year old daughter can attest to it.The service is good even though On the earlier reviews there were some negative comments. There is good crowd yet obe can have their own space. It's best to make reservations if you are hoping to entertain someone special.It's a romantic place too for your first date. Likewise a great place for business lunch. Do give it a try
5
I have been invited for business lunch to The Costal Settlement and was a bit scared when we did arrive at the parking. Lots of old stuff like cars and motor bikes are placed around that place. The entrance is around the spot and then when we did enter the restaurant even more of bikes and old stuff inside. Actually it feels almost like in a oldtimer museum.After a little while I noticed that this surrounding creats a really nice and unique athmosphere.I really enjoyed the food and the service was perfect!All well done! I will come back to this secret spot
3
Quite high end menu and pricey one.
Situated in a secluded area away from the public.
It's quite romantic atmosphere.
2
The location and restaurant itself are nice, but the service was very poor. The restaurant was basically empty and we had to ask 3 times for the waiters to attend to us. After we've waited 40mins without anyone near our table we decided to call the office and see if we can get their attention. The food was mediocre, I've had the very fatty beef.
2
We had lunch here after a trip to pulau ubin. The food is below average. The beef rendang is full of fat. The alioligo shrimp are basically shrimp + pasta + tomato chili sauce. I'd not recommend the place. The staff is very fries Lu though but takes 20 minutes to give you ice water when the restaurant is completely empty

Located in the Far East of Singapore (intentionally capitalised!), this out-of-the way restaurant is nestled amongst of the older bungalows and buildings around Changi Village. Main access is by car, into a small carpark, where valets will expertly shunt your vehicle into the smallest slots, a bit like an expensive jigsaw puzzle. You then walk along a verdantly green path littered with various automotive themes, into a long low building filled with tables. The interior decor is eclectic, littered with various items either described as nostalgic or junk, depending on your viewpoint. We were there on a weekend, and it was surprisingly busy and noisy, with a queue rapidly forming at the front door, so be warned. The servers were kept pretty busy, though our dinner service was prompt, but as the room layout is large and long, I can imagine that it would get challenging as the room fills up. Food was generally pretty good - menu items were mostly western orientated, with a little bit of a fusion twist. Prices were reasonably high; so this wouldn't fit my definition of cheap eats.Scored mainly for ambience, though 3.5 points would probably be the real score

There are plenty of such eateries in Singapore; selling more of a concept than the food. It does dish out some decent food, but all in all, it's stuff that you can get elsewhere at better prices, but without the ambience of a secluded settlement not far from the coast, with (for some reason) quite a few Vespas parked in it.It's a nice place to hang out with your teenage kids and be seen as a "hip" parent, but if you're after a proper hearty meal to remember, then continue searching

Visited for brunch here on Saturday and it was crowded. We did not have a reservation, but they managed to find a table for us at the bar area. Do note that on weekends, they do not serve the beef rendang (I had visited just for that actually) during brunch, and there is mandatory valet parking (you decide the tip amount), or you can park at the public carparks a short distance away.Service was very good.We started with the calamari, and the grilled pomegrante was a nice touch, instead of the usual lemon. I do wish that the squid could have been crispier, but it was nice.My wife had the mee goreng, which was flavourful but was a little wet. It came with three large and very fresh Tiger prawns. I had the nasi lemak and the chilli and rice was great. The fried chicken was a little cold and tough - perhaps it was cooked earlier. The ikan bilis and nuts were crisp but a little sweet
3
We went there during NDY and was a casual dining restaurant a place to go to unwind with friends. We shared a few items and they were ok but were not fantastic.Is definitely worth visiting at least once. The location is in a remote, desolate surrounding. If you want a decent venue in the East, The Coastal Settlement is definitely a good option
3
We heard good reviews about this place and were not very impressed when we finally visited it for dinner. The place is quirky in terms of its vintage decor so there are a number of conversation pieces around that make for interesting observations, but we found the place too dark. The food was overpriced and mediocre in taste and presentation
3
One of the hidden gems in the east that is a great place to bring kids. I love to bring my family there because the spacious compound with a garden and two swings. The valet parking helps to waste no time searching for a lot. As cafe is quite isolated it should be easy finding a lot even though the carpark is quite small.The decor of the place oozes the vintage vibes with retro bikes and vintage record players. I like how these vintage items goes well with the huge chandeliers. The food wise is pretty decent but average. We enjoyed the breakfast better than the lunch. Chicken and waffles were an interesting combination and taste surprisingly good despite the unappetizing presentation.The service can be abit slow during peak hours usually in the morning
4
We went as family for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was 90% full. The ambient is very country side, very relaxing.We ordered pulled pork, roast chicken & beef burger. All are yummy, especially the pulled pork. The portion is quite big so we were unable to try any desserts. Definitely a good dining place to enjoy a long lazy afternoon.
5
Although this place is a little far off from the city, but the long drive was really worth it. The restaurant itself has quirky decor and vintage cars standing outside. My favorite bit of the dinner was the heavenly waffles dessert!
4
The way to go there is long... Without a car it's not even an option as price climbs high.
But, if you already got there you'll like it...
Great setup and design, good ambience and 70-80 soft music, good food and very good deserts.

Coastal Settlement is a hidden gem of a restaurant in Singapore. Located near Changi Village, they serve excellent food with quick and efficient service. The place looks quirky with its design and look but you'll get used to its quiet and unique ambiance. A definite must for those looking at a unique dining experience in Singapore

This review combines food with adventure. I enjoy doing this and do it maybe 4 times a year. Timing is of essence cause what we are going to do is take a walk and it ends with dinner.It starts at Changi Village, at the Ferry Terminal entrance which is just next to the Civil Service Club. The walk begins at the boardwalk where at stages we are walking above the sea water and walking thru history. Changi was home to the British soldiers, so a lot of the remains lies there. When you reach the end of the boardwalk, stay and watch the Sun set close to 6.30-7 pm. After that fulfilling walk, head down to Coastal Settlement , for pre dinner beers or cocktails to relax and wipe the sweat off. This restaurant houses things of the past, an old bicycle, trunks, a BMW, a VW, and the deco is so retro. The food is a mix of western and local and you will be spoilt for choices. The desserts are great too. Its a perfect place to end the evening with family and friends. A place you won't forget. The only problem is the que to get in, yes its very popular and getting a table might be delayed. Make reservations first

i think the striking point of the lace is the oldies deco. some mentioned the BMW in the room, there are tons of artifacts around. makes for a different place.regards food, we stayed on the western side; no one tried the local version of the fusion. wagyu cube, portobello fries, ribeye and lamb chops were quite tasty (ok, i could do without the sauce on the meat which was very good). on the expensive side, in spite of the place being pretty much out of town.service definitively needs a polish. enthusiastic youth is not what makes professional.nice place to go to change the mood
4
This is one of those great multi-functional places where you can go with colleagues, with your kids or on a romantic date. It suits purpose on all occasions.Food seems a bit expensive but the quality can match it. The seafood especially is very fresh and well prepared
4
My husband and I went to the Coastal Settlement for brunch. We were recommended the place, and we loved it. I have to agree that the restaurant has different sitting areas, and I disliked one as I thought it was too gloomy; the other two, especially the lounge, are gorgeous. There is outdoor dining areas as well.
3
It is a huge restaurant. The decoration, furniture and ambience makes you feel you just came back to your childhood living room in the 70s. There is even a big old BMW car in the restaurant. The food doesn't strike me as fantastic but then again, I am not a foodie at all. Tried Potobello Fries and not at all like them. Strange. Many people recommended it on Swarm. The menu looks interesting and offers a big variety from local food to pizzas to Western cuisine. Will come back to try other foods. Parking can be a problem. My advice is not to park by the side of the restaurant but park somewhere further down the road. You may need to walk a little but definitely won't risk being blocked by other cars when you are about to leave. It is quite easy to find. It is next to the spanking new Old Changi Hospital that is now a hotel

The family of 3 made its trip from Katong for brunch on Sunday morning. We were among the first to arrive and had to wait for the kitchen to be ready. It was worth the little wait as we were rewarded by delicious Half-and-Half (waygu beef and prawns) pizza and nicely done fish and chips. The food seems to be much better than my earlier trip here for lunch
4
Went there today for small bites and lingered over coffee and an early dinner. Ordered the truffle fries which came with 2 dipping sauces and a plate of nachos with cheese. Both snacks were good. The atmosphere is very nostalgic, with old 70s and 80s antiques and items. Even children's fairy tale books are available to browse through. We ordered the beef and mushroom pizza for dinner. I had it before and the standard remained the same- delicious and tasty. Coffee was good as well. Flat white and cappuccino.
3
The atmosphere is great but however the food is quite disappointing. The range of food is really little with just pizzas.
2
Food was average and service standards varies from staff to staff. The Filipino service staff was crude and lacking in service quality. But impeccable service from local staff. Ambience is good and so was selection of music which was also just at right audio level.
4
Excellent atmosphere, innovative food, nice upscale version a few local cuisine options, western options also available, and decent and cheerful service. There is nothing not to like about this place. In fact, I would go so far as to say that this is one of those places that helps to make Singapore a better place to live.
4
Had a late lunch there. Lucky for us to find the last parking lot as well as the only table available for the indoor. The food we order were slightly above average, services are fine. The XO Prawn Aglio Olio (S$23) is actually the so call "hei bi hiem" aka sambal chili prawn, quite spicy. Another dish ordered was TCS Eggs Benedict (S$23), I like how the eggs were done. Bandung drink (S$6). Will be back to try other dishes. For an average person like me, I find the food here is quite expensive. The deco and environment of this place is fantastic! Recommend you apply insect repellent if you are prompt to mosquitos' bite
5
This place kinda remind me the past. It reminisce to go back on time. It's very quiet durinh the weekdays and it so peaceful with hot horlicks on your table and a nacho or chocolate lave cake and just look the surroundings it can give a relaxing feeling. Though the cost of the food is expensive, once awhile you have to tried in order to tell a story. I have my nasi lemak there it was fantastic. Why not bring your friends or loves during weekdays and have quality time and have fun to this lovely plac

Great service. Great atmosphere/vintage decorations. Great menu and presentation. Unfortunately the actual food was hit-and-miss.Had a salmon and avocado salad for starters. Generous portion, great salmon and vegetables, but the dish was a bit boring - would have liked some kind of dressing or even just some lemon.Tried the fish tacos. The fish itself might have been among the best fried fish I've had in my life, but it desperately needed something to make that beautiful fish some justice. There was just a little dollop of some bland, sweet and runny coleslawy thing underneath.Tried the already-mentioned wagyu beef and mushroom pizza. Bread and meat - just fantastic. Mushrooms OK (though too many). But what almost ruined the pizza for me was the abundance of caramelized onion, it turned something that was already fairly greasy into a sickly sweet greasy.If the food was more consistent I would definitely go out of my way just to hit this place on the way to or from the airport next time. Now - not so sure
4
Had lunch there today and enjoyed the experience. It's an eclectic eatery with an old world feel can charm, coupled with a few VW cars dotted around the premises. There are little old school knick knacks such as an old ice machine and even parts of a horse carousel on the rooftop.We were recommended the beef rendang, which was delicious - soft, full of flavour and a nice portion, all for $18. The pickles that came with it were insipid though, or simply overshadowed by the rich and spicy taste of the beef. We also had a couple of pints of lager, which went very well with the meal.Service was okay. Free parking is available, but do arrive early as spaces are taken up fast. Do go to check out the easy and laid back vibes and the good food
4
Cosy restaurant and bar in a charming old house furnished with vintage finds. There are also outdoor sittings in the garden that has seen better days. Though quite a drive from the city area, this is close to the airport on the eastern part of the island. Serving popular local dishes and western food from American diners, it is good for gatherings and post-dinner drinks
5
Just been to Coastal for a quick drink and a bite after work on Friday night.Had to write a review because my wife, who was the most exhausted in the group, knocked over her glass of beer. It broke the glass and beer sloshed everywhere. Not only did the staff race into action to clear the mess, we were immediately moved to another table and a fresh beer deivered in moments. The boss/manager later made a point of ensuring that the spilt beer was not charged to our bill. In all, I have to thank everyone there. Okay, it wasn't that busy but even so. Friday evening was made so much better as a result.Absolutely excellent service and really genuine attention to detail. It means a lot.
4
Situated in Changi, you really need to take a Taxi or drive here but the journey would be worth it. The ambience was good and reminds you of the good old days. The food was also very good and we have been repeat customers of it. The portobello fries are a must try and I can still taste the juiciness with every bite. Parking might be a nightmare though but there have valet service during the peak period. Remember to book if possible. It does get quite crowded at times and you don't want to be waiting outside and letting the mosquitoes eat before your turn
4
Very cool and eclectic with all sorts of hip antique decor including a handful of vintage VW Beetles artistically painted. The food was great, especially the green apple juice, the steak & mushroom pizza and best of all the green tea dessert
4
This place warms you as you walk up to the door - old cars, bikes and interesting memorabilia lay scattered around giving a nice "diner" feel to the place. Inside it is no different - an old BMW, old Vespas, bikes, other fun things, upside down furniture taped to the roof and so on make it an interesting place to be.The food is good, with a mid-reasonable range of western and asian foods, burgers through to noodles. The fries/chips are super!my only bug was the service - it is friendly but a touch slow and not especially attentive.....but the ambience is worth the visit and you will eat well there too...
1
Though the restaurant has an interesting eccentric decor, we were disappointed with both quality of service and food for our brunch visit. Ordered grapefruit juice and got served a pale looking sweet Limey drink as if we didn't know what grapefruit juice is (PINK for heaven's sake!) and burger was laced with headache causing salty substance!
5
It's a hidden gem, a virtual break away from the city. Close to Changi Village, yes you need to drive there or take a cab, but it's worth it. Everyone there is trendytrendy and cool looking. Every item on The menu is good looking and tasty! Great for kids/ family
4
Lovely place to go to on a quiet afternoon. Food is good for its price range. Staff were friendly as well, and reservations were made easily. We tried going once at night and found that there was an overwhelming number of people who drive. Sadly we missed out reservation at night because we were unable to find a good parking spot
5
First off, you need a car to get to this place. The restaurant was nicely decorated making it a really nice environment for a date or a quiet dinner. We had Pot of Clams and Mussels, Salmon Mac & Cheese, Fish & Chip, Wagyu & Mushroom pizza and 5 cheese pizza. The food was really good. I personally really enjoy the Pot of clams and mussels. The fish in the Fish & Chip is not anything special. However, I really enjoy their hand cut thick fries. Will love to come here for a date in the near future
4
A unique experience on a Saturday morning at coastal settlement, the place is decorated with furniture from the 70s creating a very nostalgic environment. The food portion are quite huge, well they charge 20+ for two egg dish... The cost is in the high side thou. Open at 10:30am but kitchen only ready at 11am..... and there are mossy outside the restaurant so I don't really understand why some choose to sit outdoor....
4
been here to celebrate my birthday and i will say this is really a nice place to be. outside you will have been amaze by the decoration. this vintage cars and when you go in you will be amazed by the details of the vintage item. food wise i will say is pretty decent. above normal but lack the punch. but overall the environment really add point to this place
4
A neat little discovery and well-'themed'. The quirky-ness is perhaps contrived but it doesn't really suffer as a result. Expect a slight mustiness if you are first in the lunch crowd as there is a lot of retro-kitsch around including a gallery of Vespas along one wall!I like the place because it has that great blend of simple western favourites (like Fish and Chips) served well and in generous portions alongside great local staples. My favourite is Char Kway Teow. Is it the best ever? Nowhere near but it is tasty and a good portion size. Food like this goes down well with a couple of beers and although the range is limited the drinks are served well and come at a reasonable price.Overall, I like the place. It's just the right distance from town to make you feel like you are taking a mini break from the more hectic bustle of the city. You have a slight sense of going back in time without the inconvenience of the discomforts of those bygone days (full air-conditioning inside for example). I'd recommend it to most people as a useful place to 'hangout' and especially at the weekends when you want to see less concrete and a little more greenery

I was staying as a guest in the Raintr33 hotel across the road, during midweek and visited the coastal settlement at lunchtime. I entered from the restaurant car park and frankly was not sure if the place was open or not, but then I saw that some lights were on and continued to walk down the side of the building. As I did I could see that the restaurant which is actually long and narrow was indeed open and in fact very full.This is a place that is clearly popular with expats who work in the Changi area. The eclectic decoration is of a 1960s/1970s style and this together with the menu explained one of the references in an earlier review to an "Australian" cafe range. It has an East meets West type of fusion menu, with large robust portions which can be shared and an international range of drinks and beverages.Prices are generally in line with upmarket (but not fine dining) western dining locations in Singapore. You can eat indoors or outdoors. I had no problems with the service and would happily go again
4
Visited here for a quick business lunch and found the service good and the menu varied between some local fusion and some traditional pub style favorites. The food came quickly and was tasty. The atmosphere was fun. Enjoyed my visit.
3
Don't let people bring dogs - my dinner was spoiled the other night by a barking dog at the table next to us - I don't appreciate people sharing their pets especially not whilst i am eating......
4
Went there with friends for brunch. The food is fresh and delicious. The choice is out of this world. Service could have been better during coffee time. Overall a nice place to come for brunch.
4
going this place with my wife and child on friday 6pm. nice food and Atmosphere. staff is helpful.we will go again.
4
You won't find this place unless you're staying in a hotel close to Changi Airport.It's fresh, lively and and has that bit of fun about it.Food and drink prices are in the "Australian" cafe range, and you do get value for your dollar.there's a separate bar area for drinks only if you like.Outdoor and indoor
2
This is my 2nd time here as I stay nearby. Food is priced on the higher side which I don't really mind if it is tasty with nice environment. Example Nasi Lemak for $16. The staff here don't smile or may not even look at you when they are talking to you. There is no warm service personnel at this place. You eat, finish, pay and you go. Probably will not come here for the third time. Good is OK though
4
Been there few times. its a fresh break from the usual deco of outlets. in here, you can find all the 70s and 80s real stuff that you used to play with. they are the real stuff, not re-make for deco. it's a nice place for a catch up meal and chat about the past. they are only open at 1030am and food from 11am onwards. alto its retro theme, the prices are not retro prices. be prepared to pay the market price.the serving are not for single person. best to share. free parking available
4
My little sister insisted on checking out this location, mainly because the cafe allowed pets to sit in the al fresco area and my sister wanted a change of scenery. We went at tea time during the week day, so it was pretty empty and quiet. My dog had a water bowl courtesy of the cafe and he enjoyed a short walk around the garden and old toys that make the Coastal Settlement unique in decor. The mojito was good, but the cake in the jar was much better!P.S. if anyone's complaining about the dogs, do yourselves a favor and sit indoors if possible. Dog owners also need to be responsible in keeping their pets calm
4
TCS is a great chill out place for the urbanationalities. Much has been spoken about the decor. Spot an old BMW amongst bric a brac of the past. An Annabelle lookalike doll stood in one hidden corner whilst the place is dotted with old "antique" furniture. Everything from 50s telephone sets to old typewriters are plainly on display and if u want to bring home some history, there are old digital watches on sale at the counter.Food wise, the hubby and I shared a pot of clams and mussels and a plate of crayfish laksa. I am blown away by the intensely fragrant laksa. Thickened by generous amount of dried prawns (虾米）,this gravy is truly satisfying.I can safely say that this place has both the look and the substance.Price is similar to usual pub, but I will now opt for this place rather than normal pub, for its unique charm
4
We visited this place for lunch on Sunday after having read about the recent coffee/eatery/hipster developments in the Changi area. Not having bothered to go to Changi Village for about two years we could clearly see the change. Wow! It's changed! And for the better! We can see this becoming an alternative to for instance Dempsey Hill. It has a nice charming rustic feeling but gone are the days when hawker food was the only thing you could get here. The Coastal Settlement is a bit out of the way though. We walked it up from the main street/ferry point which required a walk of about fifteen minutes. No problem of course but if you are not in the mood for walking and a sweaty back make sure you have your taxi driver go all the way. The building and atmosphere are great. It's a huge spacious place with tons of tables and although the place looked pretty full we had no trouble getting a table (mind you: this was the weekend the place was discussed and recommended in the Straits Times). The food is good, though I wouldn't say exceptional. In fact we were a bit surprised by a brunch menu that was very egg and fries oriented. I had the Eggs Benedict which were pretty much the way they should be; my partner had the fish tacos which were also tasty though not particularly 'Mexican'. While watching the rain come down we had truffle fries and a pint of beer, the latter which was a surprisingly cheap at 13 dollars. The only thing that needs work is the service. We were well attended to by a chipper young woman but the guy who was also 'supposedly' taking orders and 'running around' making the customers get their stuff was hopeless. Would I recommend this place? Yeah... to a certain degree. I think this place makes for a nice way out to Changi Village. A fun idea is to head out early, take the ferry to Pulau Ubin, go for a hike or bike ride, and then come back to Singapore mainland around lunch and head out to this place. Otherwise: cheers to Changi for being the next big hipster outing on the menu
2
A hark back to a bygone era! Love the decor and ambiance, but the prices... argggh. I suppose they can charge the steep prices if they are packed on the weekends.
4
I love the vintage atmosphere, menu is a bit simplistic but consistently good. Can be busy at night, reservation recommended.

Gotta admit im pretty damm disappointed with the experience especially after hearing all the raves abt the place. Here's my take:- foodFood was fine. Nothing fantastic but taste was pleasing to the palette. Variety of food on the menu was good. Except that they dont serve regular plain fries and nuggets to adults. Key word- adult. I would have also appreciated it if the staff bothered to let me know that they changed my cheese hotdog to the pork one. I cant imagine. What if i cant eat pork? Place isnt halal but at least have the basic courtesy to let me know the options rather than just changing without informing me about what i would be eating? I had to bite into in after a while before i oulmmmm- ambienceLocation plus entire ambience was good. Quaint, cosy, good. Regardless of indoor or outdoor seating, i thought the concept was good. -serviceOne word- poor. It's extremely disappointing when all other elements are relatively good. Whats the point of having good ambience and food if the servers are plain rude? It's fine if you dont smile but to the extend that you respond rudely to someone who barely knows you and is genuinely asking a question that wasnt even rude? I think thats just sad. As a customer, i feel sad. Whats the point of attempting to create an experience when your staff doesnt even have basic courtesy? Is there no basic training done? I only had 2 other people who were really polite. That's it. Definitely not returning despite the good ambience.

As a group of 20+ from my husbands company we went for dinner to this quaint little place. Lovely old school decor, with golden oldies music. Service was especially good considering we were such a large group of people. Food arrived at a constant pace, piping hot and very delicious. Wine list a bit minimalistic but still managed to find something we liked. Lovely laid back atmosphere with very friendly staff. Best to take a taxi there as it is is out of town. Fortunately with the excellent taxi booking service in Singapore it is not too much of a problem finding a cab home. Highly recommended

There were a few local blogs about this place. Heard about the existence of those blogs but never read them. What held me back from trying the place is its location. Changi, that's FAR away... However, I was in Tampines a few Sundays ago. What better opportunity. The place is located just down the road away from Changi Village where the bus terminal is. The single storey building was "decorated" by old furniture & vehicles. The entrance was through a little garden of sorts with stone garden table & stools. The parking area is tiny. Upon reaching the place via Cranwell Road, we were greeted by a friendly guy who was the valet. Inside, the mishmash of vintage furniture, Vespas along with other odds & end resulted in an eclectic old school vibe. I immediately fell in love with the venue.My partner & I shared a couple of dishes. All of which were good.1) Pot of mussels & clams - Boston mussels, white clams, tomatoes, fennel, leek, light cream & white wine. Served with slices of baguette.The mussel clam pot was delicate in flavour. I literally emptied the pot of its contents. Not a drop of “soup” was left.2) Portobello Fries - Portobello mushrooms cut into thick slices & coated possibly in bread crumbs. Served with truffle mayo.Fried to perfection & the mushrooms retained their juiciness. We had to take away majority of the fries because the burger was filling despite sharing it. My family enjoyed it as a late night snack.3) Cheese Burger - 180g wagyu beef patty, cheddar, mushroom, bacon, caramalised onion, mesculun. Served with thick cut fries.We asked for medium rare & we got what we asked for. The patty was pink. Fantastic! The portion generous to share between 2. But if you are really hungry, this is a good choice.4) Passionfruit Pavlova - Passionfruit curd, mango compote, mixed berries with french vanilla bean ice creamA tad sweet for my liking but it is a pavlova (Egg whites & loads of sugar). It was nice but only if you like something sinfully sweet. There were a couple of other choices for dessert - cakes, waffles, custard just to mention a few.The service staff were friendly & food did not take long to be served despite the place being about 75% occupied. Saw a couple of boys behind the bar formerly from CMPB at Dempsey (an old favorite haunt of mine). One of them approached me to clarify if I was who they thought I was. It was nice that they recognised me & waved to me. Those boys along with the mussel clam pot & burger totally brought fond memories of CMPB. These 2 dishes were popular at CMPB.Definitely recommending Coastal Settlement to anyone ok with travelling out to the far far east. I loved the ambience & the food. Looking forward to making another trip in the near future

I came with my family for a Sunday Brunch, we caught the bus from Tanah Merah station and it took about half hour to get to our stop and it was about 10 mins walk (a little uphill) but it was a nice walk through the trees. We came in from the carpark and walked through a path full of plants, trees, and because it is in a secluded place it feels quiet tranquil for me. Had an old school cars and quiet a unique setting.Initially we were offered to sit at a big round table but we had a look at the outside seating which was fine as it has fans etc but we decided not to sit outside as one of the staff member said it's probably better inside at a sofa as there are mosquitoes out here and you can put the baby down on the sofa with a long coffee table. So we got the nice sofa seats to ourselves and my 2.5 yr old get his own kids seats which was brilliant, he loves it and I can place my baby safely on the sofa so I could enjoy my food. The food was fantastic, I ordered the Wagyu and mushroom pizza, liked it very much! But for me it was more of a normal beef slice then a wagyu meat but the flavours was still good and it was filling. My husband ordered the eggs and had bread on the side, which was delicious too. We ordered plain fries on the side, I love it because it's small cut and very crunchy! Overall, food was delicious. There are lots of variety of drinks to choose from ie, water, alcohol (beers, ciders, wine) , milkshakes, juices, coffee, tea etc.I was pretty impressed with this place apart from the mosquitoes, it is a nice cozy place to laze around on a Sunday, there is also a lil kids play area outside. The toilets are clean but I didn't see any changing table for baby or disable toilet. I would definitely come here again and try other things on the menu, can't wait

Very apt catchphrase for the restaurant. The ambience is amazing. Didn't notice the chairs hanging from the ceiling until someone pointed it out to me. Bits and bobs of old school feels are everywhere. Came around 6pm and the wait staff were attentive and helpful in finding the perfect spot for my friend and I. It was a rainy day and I was pleasantly surprised to be served warm water. We ordered truffle fries to start. Not the most mind blowing fries or item on the menu but it was good. Highlight of the meal was the half and half Wagyu beef and mushroom pizza and garlic prawn pizza. The pizza was basically an explosion of ingredients. Was that a whole cow? Looked like it. Prawns were massive. Pro tip: avoid the garlic prawns if it's a first date O_oService was pleasant and could tell the people around us were enjoying themselves too. A win in my books.
4
For the nostalgic souls, this is the place to be. There are so many furnitures and household items of the past that will sure to bring back some of your own fond memories.Food is not exceptionally good but it is good enough for me and my family. We love the pot of mussels and clams, as well as the wagyu beef and mushrooms thin pizza.I agree that the local food here are really overpriced, so go for the western food instead. Overall, it's a place that affords an unique experience, more than fine cuisine. You will enjoy it, if you are like me, who get so sick of spending another dinner in some crowded malls along orchard road.

We spent a night at Changi Cove Hotel, we found this Restaurant by accident a short stroll from the Hotel.There were not many patrons here when we came in for an early evening meal on a Wednesday. The staff were both friendly & efficient. We chose a Beef Rendang which was very tasty - along with this we had a Mojito & a House Red. The total cost was $S45 which was reasonable even though we shared the Rendang

Love the concept of this place...food on average side however, loves the mussel casserole aka moules marinieres :)
Recommended for a place to relax out of the concrete city of Singapore...

First ever visit. Also, it's dog friendly. Come early to avoid long queue, we went there at 5.30pm and managed to get a table without a queue. Food (pasta, pizza) is nice, but the coffee is so so. The Laksa tasted like curry and the salmon just taste weird. Order the portobello fries and the wagyu beef pizza. it's awesom

Nice ambiance for brunch and dinner but average waiting time is like 1hour ++?? On average It will take about 2 hours to get a seat and your food. If you're really hungry and can't wait to eat, head up to the hawker instead. There's more cafÃ©s around there too! Try going on weekdays, lesser crowd.

Many are here to celebrate an occasion or holiday with their families, so must say the ambiance is great with its decor, lighting and all. However, the food could not match up, and in fact was a great letdown. I really wanted to rate this place much better, but unfortunately cannot bring myself to. Not to mention they are way overpriced

After our dog training session, we were looking for a dog friendly place to eat. Came across this on the internet.Came here first time with another couple, each with our furry kid. Love the rustic feel and the greenery. A place away from the hustle and bustle of the city to relax and enjoy some good food too.The beef rendang was good. Both hubby and friend took that and enjoyed it. The nasi goreng came in a huge portion. Even friend's hubby could not finish it. The spicy tom yum spaghetti was interesting, though not spicy enough for me, a chilli eater.Returned to this place again a week later and this time we had pizza where we are allowed to mix half and half as well as the curry chicken. Love the thin crust pizza. Curry chicken was good too though hubby still prefers the beef rendang.Great outdoor feel and best thing is we can bring our furry kid with us as there are not many places in Singapore which are pet friendly.Enjoy listening to the oldies too. And also not having to worry about parking since there is a valet service

Came here with a friend after a last minute arrangement for dinner. Friendly staff. We (2 of us) ordered clam and mussels soup and wagyu beef thin crust pizza. Suffice to say that we left the place happy and fulfilled lamenting that we had no space for dessert. I am going back next week with another friend and this time will make sure that i save some space for dessert =

I visited the Coastal Settlement about a week ago with 4 of my mates. I was impressed by the decor of the place! The retro vibe really gave it some character. Shared some snacks and a tower of beer, which were both excellent. I would definitely return again

We had big breakfast and egg benedict. The big breakfast is of big portion with different variety. The scramble egg was alright, not too bad and well cook. The mushroom is tasty but salty. Worse of all would be the bacon, its ain't crispy and the usual salty version. But its sweet and soggy! Taste like its soaked in sweet soy sauce. It totally spoil the whole big breakfast concept. As for the egg benedict, its portion was ok, but the poached eggs look rather small. Most of the egg white seems to be gone. For that I'm still fine with it. However, the benedict sauce dont taste like the usual hot milky and salty. It taste sour and cold and the sauce wasn't given generously. The accompanied salad is dressed with something like sweet soy sauce. I really don't understand why they make the dishes sweet. Totally not pleasant for the early day.The experience i had today was added with poor services, long waiting of food, waiter just serve the dishes like wanting to get rid of it fast. My phone was on the table, the server place the dishes near my phone without giving me time to remove the phone and without thinking the possibility of spilling onto my phone given that the table has lot of space for the dishes. Empty dishes not clear when the next dish came. Water are not promptly refill. A thank you to the server is not return with a smile. Overall first experience was POOR for the amount charge for the food! Not a place I'm looking for a next return!

Salad was not fresh, scrambled eggs were not evenly cooked, parma ham tasted off.Staff was indifferent, one lady service staff had no qualms cutting in without notice to interrupt conversations, twice actually. Even though we were seated in the air conditioned interior, we were also pestered by a housefly throughout the meal. Better brunch options elsewhere

This is one of the few restaurants that are hidden in a corner of Changi. Theme is vintage / nostalgic. Furnishings are random mix and match and decorations are all old stuff found in the 60s, 70s. Has a good collection of Vespa scooters. Both outdoor and indoor sittings available. Food portions are adequate but prices are a little above average. The truffles fries, XO prawn spaghetti and pork ribs are worth trying. A nice getaway to chill out, away from town.Can be fully booked at times despite their not so near MRT locations, so do call to book.Cab from Pasir Ris Mrt is about $10 during peak hour.Do note that they are close on Monday but if Monday is a public holiday, they will be opened.http://www.thecoastalsettlement.com

Nice decor with a very good choice of food on the menu. Portion are fairly large. The food was tasty and well prepared. Make sure you try their pizza. I had one as an entry which was shared at the table, and it was awesome.

Finally got to meet *Sharona again, this time we go to The Coastal Settlement as agreed. This cosy, pretty little cafe is located at 200 Netheravon Road, Singapore 508529 and the number to dial is 6475 0200.As promised, The Coastal Settlement offers a village homely environment filled with haylcon of the nature outdoors and a peek of the sea not far off. Wacky furniture are strewn above and around hte restaurant / cafe The comfortable setting in this spacious compound brings one away from the hectic-ness of citylife, into a world where one could totally relax and curl up on their seats to enjoy good food and, uh, hard-to-get service (only efficient when clearing plates).We shared the 12 Hours Coastal Wings and Drumlets - half a dozen of crisp-skinned delicacies with succulent flesh and slight tinge of spiciness. They practically crumbled and melted in the mouth like molasses, and the chilli dip goes well with the chicken.Next, we actually wanted the Truffle Fries but were informed that they were running out of shoestring fries, so we had settled for the Portobello Fries they recommended. This was an interesting item and the first time we tried it - large pieces of portobello mushrooms fried till crispy on the outsisde and a lovely golden-brown shade. The inside is soft and respledant of the strong flavor of the dark mushrooms.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/03/brunch-at-coastal-settlement.htm

The Coastal Settlement is very easy to find, especially if you went to Pulau Tekong for your National Service recruit stage. It is near Commando Camp.Car park spaces are limited but they have free valet.The setting and furnitures are so nostalgic. The is even a Vespa parking beside the entrance.Food is good. I love the Wagyu beef and mushroom pizza. Very uniqueI will definitely visit agai

I go there quite often because it is near my office and I always order the same dishes: mushroom soup, truffle mushroom linguini and the waffle. But this week the food was so disappointing...not the usual taste and ingredients. The soup was watery and salty (the bread not well toasted), the linguini pasta was made of plain dried pasta you buy at the supermarket (not the usual fresh soft one they used to serve), and the waffle was accompanied with small dried pieces of strawberries instead of the fresh ones.I asked the waiter if they changed chef and, indeed he said "yes". No comments

If you are into vintage things from the old days of Singapore, this is the place to go. If you walk further into the restaurant (away from the road where the parking is), you will find that the restaurant is furnished with retro furniture, knick-knacks from the past and even childhood snacks!If you are looking at having a nice retreat away from the buzz of the city and you happen to have a car, this restaurant is a good place to go :)Had a pepperoni pizza (enough to share for 2 to 3 pax) and a horlicks milkshake (which was not bad but too sweet)

Decent menu, love the choices available. Portions are big and usually good for sharing. I am captivated by the rustic feel. Love the deco and i seem to discover something new everytime i visit. Sitting in different parts of the restaurant provides different feel too. My favorites are, portobello fries, spam fries, pizzas.Love the fact that they offer valet parking

I was captivated by the rustic and rétro interior and the laid back charm of the restaurant. We came for a late lunch. Had pizzas, pasta and ribs. The food was alright but not outstanding. Service was good. A Nice destination if you feel getting out from the busy city

Had the service been up to scratch I would have this place excellent. We sat outside even though it was raining as a lot of the outdoor area is undercover. We had four kids in tow all 10 years old and they really enjoyed their meal. Just chicken nuggets and fries but they were happy. We had the ham and cheese toast - delicious and the bangers, mash and onion rings were great too. We had a look at their brunch menu and I'd imagine that a leisurely weekend brunch on a nice sunny day there would be quite enjoyable

I think all the reviews here have mentioned the decor, and this is a laid-back, out of the way location and an escape from the urban heat.The food isn't exceptional, but it's functional. Don't expect anything too amazing from the kitchen and you won't be disappointed. It's quality café food at restaurant prices. They're using good quality ingredients here, but dishes like pizza on Lebanese bread and creamy mussels and clams are crafted to be charming old friends rather than wow you.Everything costs a bit more than it should do (a small salad is $16++, a small pizza is $22++, a beer is $13++ and a lemon barley is $7++), but it's a charming and relaxing atmosphere, so if you're looking for a breather from the city then you'll probably find it's a small price to pay

We arrived at this restaurant quite late in the evening but were accommodated without fuss. Kitchen closes at 9.45pm.We had a lovely table on the verandah overlooking the garden. The service was very good, attentive staff without being fussy.Only problem was my main course took a long time to come, everyone else had their meals bought out at the same time. Apologies from the waiter for the delay and the meal was worth waiting for. Mushroom and truffle fettucine, yum!The decor is eclectic with an unusual collection of bicycles and motor scooters displayed in cabinets around the walls! There are old VWs in the garden.It is out in Changi Village so a fair distance from the city but well worth the visit for something different.We went with our son and daughter-in-law, they paid so I don't know how expensive the meal was

The decorations inside the cafe bring back memories from the 60′s to the 80′s. Various sections of the cafe have specific themes. There is also outdoor seating available. Love their fries with vinegar and their tuna bread! Published photos here - http://effandbee.sg/coastal-settlement-among-greenery

Is my first time to visit , hard to find this type of decor in singapore
Don't feel like u r in Singapore , well worth to visit :-)

Got a bit of everything, good cocktails, well presented food. Uniquely designed interiors with old Vespa scooters and cars in the premises. Good place to unwind with friends, worth a visit at least once.

The group of five of us drove from the west for lunch. The restaurant only accepts reservations for group of 10 and above, so if you're a small group, go earlier. But then again, the place is pretty big, so you should have no problems securing a seat for smaller groups. We reached about 1.30pm on a Sunday and was promptly lead to a table for 6. But come another 1-2hours later, you will end up queuing. I love the quirky, vintage decor of the restaurant. It strikes me as a family place due to the number of kids and big family gatherings around us. The place can get pretty noisy, so don't expect a romantic conversation going on anywhere. Service was acceptable. Food was not too bad. We ordered a few main dishes and staff was quick to notice that we aim to share. Extra plates were served quickly. We love the pizza, although it does remind one from Skinny Pizza. Overall, I thought it is a good place for big gatherings

Visited for dinner after a long break. Food has improved but the service has not. Slow and not attentive. Food came at different times. Had to ask a number if times for different things. It's a busy place with lots of screaming kids. Food is as average. No different from many places. Prices are high especially for a casual eatery with poor service. Poor selection of wine and at high prices.Will definately not return. Better places to go

The group of eleven of us made a reservation for lunch. Upon arrival, we were promptly led to our table. The lunch crowd on a Friday was surprisingly large for this remote location. Those of us who ordered the fish items were served first while the beef items came much later. Personally, I found the sauce for my baby back ribs rather sweat and the meat do not come off the ribs easily. I would still prefer the ribs at Tony Roma. Overall service was good and waiters were attentive. The restaurant setting and decor is uniqu

Tucked away at a forgotten corner of Singapore, TCS is a great honest cafe/restaurant/bistro. I have been there in the morning, noon and night, and whomever I brought have never failed to be impressed. The restaurant is decked out in antiques and nick-nacks from the past. Vespas, VW Beetles, are just some of the tasteful deco.The food is a mix of local and western. The Wagyu pizza is great and easily a must try. The sea salt caramel chocolate cake is a good way to top off your meal as well.Do take note, reservations are only allowed for tables of 6 and above. So do go early. The place do tend to get noisy once it is filled up too

The coastal settlement is for Singapore standards quite far out of the city (20 minutes). That means that you have a crowd that is quite curious for something else and hence it gets a nice atmosphere. Definitely something different than the likes on Dempsey Hill.I have been twice - and liked it both times. A nice selection of local and western dishes, both cooked quite nice. Highlight was the hamburger, with thick cut fries, accompanied by a cider from some micro brewery where I had never hear off.Downside might be the waiting times if you come at peak hours - definitely an issue if you come with kids. Outside seating needs some improvement.Would go again - probably next time for a wine in the afternoon

Nice restaurant housed in an old refurbished Hospital Dispensary and Morgue, really.The food and drinks pricing a bit on the high side, portion could have been bigger, but despite all this, the FOOD ARE TASTY ! i love the ambience, after dinner do go for a walk by the Changi Western Boardwalk.

This was a dilapidated colonial building left vacant for some years. Every time I cycled or drove past this, I couldn't help but think of my army days. So it was pleasant news to find that some enterprising folks have created a quaint colonial themed restaurant, with vintage fittings.It was apparent that this new restaurant was drawing in the crowd. Within 15 min of opening, almost all the tables inside the restaurant were filled. (Ok. This was a Sat!)The service was prompt and courteous (at least by Singapore standards). We ordered burgers, salmon and salad. Generous portions (again, by Singapore standards), and we could barely finish. Quality is above average and price was a tad above average (again, by .... You get the drift).Other than the food, we particularly like the throw back theme, and for folks of a certain vintage, TCS seems like a fuzzy warm time warp with the music, ambience, greenery. We left knowing that we will be back
