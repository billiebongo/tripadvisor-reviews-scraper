limited beef selection, but the A5 miyazaki is excellent, very marbled, very thin. scallop is fresh, goma ice cream is very delicious. The only downside is coke zero is not free flow.
4
Food was great, the beef was juicy and tender. Side dishes like kimchi and sweet potato were good as well.
4
Prime beef was nice. Too bad that wagyu miyazaki shank was not available. Quite number of seafood options.
5
Bought Fave voucher for lunch buffet to celebrate a friend's birthday. They enjoyed the food very much especially the beef. Highly recommended and the standard as good as Gyuu in Hokkaido that I have been.
4
Gave the premium wagyu buffet a go, attractively priced! Service was top notch, orders were serviced impressively quick and used plates were cleared efficiently. Wagyu was not of Japan origin, unsurprising due to the economical pricing. We did enjoy the pork and scallops nonetheless!
3
Waygu beef slice too thin for hot plate. The beef steak is more substantial. Very limited selection in buffet menu. No lettuce to in the menu to go with the grilled meat. Drink not included in the menu. Don't think I will go back.
5
We were given a cozy corner for a family of 6 adults n 3 kids. Food was fantastic. The set lunches were a good deal and the service staff recommended some meat platters and they were delicious too! Service staff were helpful and very friendly. Will definitely be back at gyu++
5
We had an excellent experience at Gyuu+. We had a party of six and all went for the Wagyu buffet with the 1-for-1 promotion. With the 1-for-1, it is a very affordable buffet meal, only about $65/pax after ++ on a weeknight. The quality of the beef is extremely good, with Miyazake and USDA prime options. We calculated the value at the end of the meal, and had ended up eating over $1000 worth of food if ordered a-la-carte. The proved that the buffet was extremely good value for money.The refill service on the drinks is a bit slow, but the food comes out quickly and it is very easy to eat your fill during the 1.5 hour seating period.
4
My group of 4 went for the 1-for-1 wagyu buffet. The meat quality was good, we ordered once of each of the 3 beef items and went on to other dishes. Of the 2 chicken dishes, the garlic chicken was good. Seafood unfortunately (scallop and shishamo) were average. Thought the vegetable selection should be wider, as these do not cost much. Both goma and matcha ice cream were included in the buffet, goma was really good. At the nett cost of $66 per pax, the meal would be reasonable for those who load up on wagyu
4
Had a reservation at 8pm but went there earlier at about 7, and the service staff promptly seated us.There were not alot of choices for the meat, but they were of good quality. The staff were responsive and adhered to our requests quickly.Overall an enjoyable experienc
5
Food was fresh. Although it was a bbq, we didn‚Äôt smell after that. Food was served promptly. I would definitely come back for more!
3
Had the 1-for-1 buffet; rather thin slices of waygu but beef steak was generous; do season with salt and pepper as it comes without. Not worth the price even on promo. Limited selection compared to others. Gas n not charcoal.
3
Food was okay. The A5 beef was quite disappointing. Had really high expectation for it but it's not as tender or melty that what I had imagined. The scallops and salmon was quite good tho.
5
The sirloin were of excellent quality and really tender and flavorful. Scallops were superbly fresh and sweet. Will definitely be back for more
5
Wowoowow! It was the best buffet I every had in years! We had the promo for 1 for 1 and grabbed the chance while we can! Totally worth it!
3
Meat were a little bland for liking and they seem to lack freshness. Placed a wrong order due to the not very interactive e-menu, staff were not helpful to rectify the situation. Ended up paying a good sum of ala carte money for one plate of neat ordered in error. This was very close the same price one would have paid for a buffet lunch. Both ice cream flavours were good and worthy. Overall, there are better options avaliable
3
Walked in for dinner. Restaurant was full (understandably because of a 1-for-1 promo and the fact that it was a Saturday).Perfectly happy to walk away. BUT - the service staff (Maria was her name), was clearly too satisfied and happy to disappoint us when she remarked "we are full".We didn't eat (clearly), but that left a bad taste in my mouth. At the very least the waitress could have showed SOME empathy, or even offered an alternative time. None was given. Very disappointed with the way staff are trained to handle customers here. You may be full during peak, but a customer is someone you want to retain regardless, not offend.Disclaimer:Had come to Gyuu+ a couple of times since it first opened here.The food is pretty good, and they sometimes have 1-for-1 deals which go easier on the wallet.Food wise and the rest of the wait staff I've come across were ok
4
The Wagyu beef buffet with 1-for-1 at $98++ per pax is quite value for money as the marbling for the beef is really quite good. The wagyu beef retails for about $50 per plate in the supermarket and we easily polished off 5-6 dishes and got our money√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worth. Wish they provided more types of sauces though and the main sauce for the beef tasted somewhat bland.Save some room for the ice cream as the black sesame flavour is yummy!
5
Booked on Chope and get 1 for 1 promotion with OCBC card, which makes the buffer well worthy. Buffet choices are less than a la carte but enough already for two people. I like scallop, pork shoulder, sweet potato and ice cream! Overall, I prefer japanese yakiniku than korean bbq
3
The service was really fast . Whenever we submit our order on the tablet the food is delivered almost immediately. The quality of the A5 beef was not A5 quality at all. Perhaps it had been sliced too thin and after bbq tasted tough. A pity.
3
There's not many choices for you, less vegetables to choose, not deserve the price for me, the service is okay!
5
Must try the premium beef slice (available dinner only), scallop, garlic chicken (super tender), shishamo. Sesame and green tea ice cream is good too. Price on the high side but if you have OCBC 1 for 1 then go for it!
4
quality of meat could be a bit inconsistent though. but generally we had a good experience at the restaurant.
5
Everything was perfect. The bbq was delicious and the staff was helpful. We would definitely visit again. Oh, this is the 3rd visit within 2 months!
4
This is probably one of my favorite places to have beef.
Good food and excellent quality of beef!
Price is on the high side so we went for the OCBC credit card promotion. We will be back again!
4
Great place to enjoy wagyu beef. It located in the Marina Square at the Emporium Shokuhin.
Go for the buffet as it really worth the $$.
4
Went because there is a promotion from fave. Making it v worth it . Only abbot $30 with the promotion. Went there once without promotion each pax about $80 but with more variety of food.
Rated this after Gyu Kaku :)
4
Fresh and good quality meat selection. friendly and helpful staff! probably nicer with longer dining time.
4
The service and delivery was fast and prompt, but the spread of food was not that extensive. The hotplate was too small to cook many pieces of meat at once. Hence 90 minutes was alittle short to order, grill and eat till your hearts content
5
We had the 1 for 1 wagyu buffet promo. Plus drinks it was around $129 for two people after taxes. Tried all the different types of beef offered (USDA sirloin, USDA sirloin steak) and the A5 miyazaki was my favourite. Even though it's stated as A5, the meat did not have a lot of marbling. Same goes for the USDA steak. Not much fats.The marinated salmon and spicy pork belly was very good though. Would return again if there is a discount.
5
There was a 1 for 1 promo. Meat was fresh and valued for money. Service was good too. We really enjoyed our experience!
3
Service from both manager and supervisor was efficient and friendly when we can some issue with the food served. However, service crew is not very helpful in service.
3
The food and service are veryÔºåhowever the gyuu+ is a little difficult to find. If the 1 for 1 promotion would continueÔºåI would like to come again.
5
For $70 a pax with unlimited wahyu beef, fish is fresh and serving is prompt, üëçüèªüëçüèª. If only the buffet include some fruits, that would be fantastic!
2
The beef quality looks not too bad but the grill is terrible so it makes the beef burnt on the outside but not cooked inside. Ended up eating a lot of tough beef
4
Good experience, with good service and try different cut of beef including Wagyu beef.
The time limit of 90mins for buffet limit the real experience.
5
We had a pleasant experience here, the food was of excellent quality. Service staff were helpful and offered assistance and taught us how to BBQ certain types of food such as the shishamo. They also prompted us for our last order and asked if we wanted deserts. Pretty good service and worth the 1-1 price! We will definitely be back!
1
I had the 1 for 1 a5 wagyu buffet. It's not really 1 for 1 as gst and service charge is charged for both pax. At almost $70 each, it's a total ripoff. meat was tough and kept sticking to the grill. There was hardly and beef taste. Pork was also very tough. Orders were served fast but staff were not attentive
5
Had dinner here. There is a one-for-one wagyu buffet which is excellent value - 2 dunes for $98 (pre-taxes and service charge). The meats are really good. Fresh, good cuts. Beef is great and so is the pork shoulder. Salmon is really fresh and delicious too. Nice ambience. Not overly smoky too. Better than Gyu-Kaku (in my opinion)
3
The selection for both the lunch and dinner buffet was decent, the food was served quickly upon ordering. The only downside was the size of the grill; it was considered small for 2 people. I cannot imagine fighting for grill space if there were 4 people dining
4
Bought it when there‚Äôs promo. Worth the dollar we paid and great ambiance. Just the steak bit disappointed. 8/10
3
The wagyu beef was nowhere near the standard we had in Japan. Felt disappointed and cheated. The environment and service was fine but the food quality leaves much to be desired.
4
The quality of food is good but the variety is somewhat limited. The service staff is friendly and offered tips on the meat grilling.
5
This is my first time went for this restaurant. The staffs were very friendly and give a good service. One of the staff like to make joke on us.
5
Meat quality was excellent for the lunch set. If you have more time, u can go for the 60 mins lunch buffet. There is also the premium wagyu buffet for dinner and they are having 2 for 2 promo now. Worthwhile!
5
Attentive service, value of money and definitely worth it when promotions are on, would visit again and definitely recommend
4
Food is good, but service is a bit slow, atmosphere is good, you wont smell bad after bbq that is good as normally after bbq whole body will smell bad.
5
My friends and I went for the Wagyu Lunch Buffet 2for2 promotion, which was very worth it and delicious. The quality of the beef was very good and there was also a free flow of vegetables and certain seafoods. We were not done eating even though it was after closing time, and the kind staff told us to take our time and that they were technically closed. The service was very good and the staff were nice and understanding, despite it being a public holiday. We will definitely go back there again
2
There were 5 selections of beef for the dinner buffet. We ordered all of them, and none of them met our expectation. The beef was very dry even the wagyu one. It tasted like a paper. Korean $49.99 buffet near our home is much better.For the buffet at this price we would expect something with higher quality. I'd like to give one star but the service was good. Therefore, two stars would be appropriate
4
Ordered the buffet dinner menu. Different cuts of the beef was served. Tasted very good especially with sauce.The seafood menu was also nice. Service was prompt. Although we had a 90 mins limit, the staff was very gentle to remind us to order the last serving. Both type of ice cream served was also very nice. Would recommend to anyone who has no budget constraints
2
The food did not the expectations. The cuts of meat were unmarinated. The hot metal grill was never changed. Not worth coming again.
4
The selection of meat was value for money and the place was not very smokey despite the grilling.
However, they can increase the size of the grill as it is full after placing a few pieces of steak.
4
Nice place for meat BBQ. No doubt the variety is not much, but it can sure make one full with the choices of beef.
5
Easy e-ordering system, good food and good service provided by staff and restaurant manager, Ms Katherine.
5
Good quality wagyu beef and excellent service by restaurant staff and service manager, Ms Katherine.
5
Limited variety of meat but quality met expectations. Especially enjoyed the scallops and the Wagyu beef!
4
The star of the show were the thin strips of well marbled Wagyu. The steaks pales in comparison though - they were good but needed some skill to cook. The cooking pod was pretty small but it was ok for 2 of us.
5
We always enjoy our visits to Gyuu+ because the cuts of meat are delicious and the staff are both knowledgeable and helpful. Of special mention are George and Hussan. George knows exactly how each cit or meat or seafood should be cooked and gives great tips and instructions! Hussan goes out of his way to make sure that your ever need is met and even anticipates your needs! Kudos to both of them for always making our lunch experience here wonderful!I would recommend trying their wagyu beef buffet. It's a bit pricey but the cuts of meat grill so beautifully and you can't go wrong!Thank you
5
We had the lunch buffet as a celebration for our team achieving our sales target. The food was excellent! Salmon was fresh, the steaks were juicy and they gave very generous thick cuts. It was wonderful. And the pace of new orders came promptly. Good job to the team! Thumbs up
4
Brought my mom here for her actual birthday celebration since she is a #1 fan of steak. First off, dint realise it was self grilled and 2ndly, the selection was so limited but I guess our beef goal was accomplished. Cud not get enough of the green tea ice cream
4
2nd time here! great value for money with quality meats. just make sure you cook the meat properly. lunch selection is similar to the dinner selection less the scallops which was a little disappointing. overall recommend! my girlfriend loves it too!
5
Had the A5 beef using their signature card. Beef was velvety soft! They have a national promo now for their buffet. Definitely worth going for the buffet!
4
We had the executive set lunch. Very worth it - for $49.90, we had beef, pork, seafood, unagi n Korean pickles. Definitely a place I would bring my family next time. Not forgetting, the service staff is very good - not instrusive yet attentive.
5
Food was awesome, quality of beef exceeded expectations, great service staff and brought food very quickly.
5
This place isn't cheap, but i'd say that if you are willing to splurge a little, the food is worth every cent. Excellent food and impeccable service.
3
Went on a Friday. We were prompty served and led to the table. Strict with their 90mins policy, but we're cool with it. Food came quick for a start, and portions were good and sufficient. However, as we ate, the wagyu quality dropped. Was not as marbled and sliced as the first batch. Subsequent servings were messy and overly fatty. Food came on a slower pace. Had to wait for more than 15mins for each order which greatly reduced our eating time. When the bill came we were shocked that the promoted $51.84++ was not true. We were charged more than $70 each. Tried to rectify but they came up with excuses of sorts. Not sure if will come back. Felt cheate
5
This is my family's 3rd time at Gyuu+, and once again, it does not disappoint. Service was good. The staff were always smiling and friendly, and always up for a chat or a joke. They were also very prompt with their service. Food-wise, the food was fresh, and the A5 Miyazaki was awesome as usual. My family loved the pork shoulder, scallops, and salmon, on top of the Miyazaki beef. We would totally go there again!
4
Had family dinner at Gyuu+ on 28 July 2017 to celebrate our daughter's tertiary graduations. We enjoyed the buffet dinner that currently has promotion: One dine free with three paying Adults. Premium beef are included however the thickness on A5 Miyazaki Beef is not meant for Yakiniku Grill because too thin. The cut is meant for Shabu Shabu. As a result, can't appreciate this premium Wagyu, it is a waste indeed. Please improve this area in order to achieve excellent dinning experience.90 minutes eat all you can buffet with current promotion is value for money
5
This bbq grill restaurant boasts an extensive variety of meats, from prime cuts to your basic selections. I enjoyed the wagyu slices, but the grassfed steak was a supreme letdown. Wasted calories! There are seafood offerings such as squid and baby scallops which were lovingly served on their half shell. The buffet was an a la carte menu style, so you will have the chance to indulge in cycle of repetition, if you fancy so. I do enjoy the tabletop bbq experience but the downside of this restaurant was the size of the grill; it was pathetically small, even for a couple. I would never wish to fight for grill space, especially if it is a times buffet. The charred grills were changed swiftly, plates were cleared adequately fast too. Ipad ordering serving meant it saves you time from flaying your arms in the air when it could be spent grilling more precious meat slices. Please make a booking for this, you will thank me for this reminder!
4
A reasonable selection with good quality meats on offer. The highlights are the USDA prime and Kurobuta pork. The vegetables of leeks, mushrooms, peppers were of good quality too. Service was prompt and helpful with the chef making his rounds making recommendations on the intensity of the fire for the grill. Overall, a good experience
5
Been here a few times. Always good, Service staff has always been nice. Good quality meats Authentic Japanese Wagyu.
5
Good options for lunch. The quality of beef is very high. Service is also good. Am a returning customer.
4
Value for money and quality ingredients provided, especially the A5 beef slices. Service was fast and excellent too! Would be good to include more seafood items like prawns as too much meat!
3
Ordered the buffet, the range of selection is okay but meat quality is average. Drinks is not included in the buffet but you can order soup which is included in the buffet.
5
Beef was lovely. I had my buffet here. Cozy environment, attentive staffs, fast service. Kurobuta is also available for steak which was fantastic too. Macha icecream was also awesome. Pefect for couples or friends gathering. Below are cons: drinks are not included in the buffet list and price, and GST is counted on the original price but not on the discount price (you can see clearly in one of my photos below.
4
Went for the A la Carte menu as the buffet menu seemed to have only the average quality meats and dessert, and I wanted something special to celebrate an event. The Miyazaki Platter was the best, the beef was truly melt-in-the-mouth and had an excellent flavour
4
Nestled in the emporium, Gyuu+ proved to be a popular dinner haunt. The buffet options were sufficient albeit the grass fed steak was an utter let down. Go for the scallops, paper thin (definitely wished this was thicker but ouh well!) wagyu beef and scallops. Everything served were fresh, and the staff were efficient in clearing out the plates. My partner and I did not leave the grill bar smelling of smoke, and I appreciate that! Call to make reservations to make your dining experience a more enjoyable one.
4
The buffet has very good meat cuts. Food arrived fast. The only bad thing I would say is the variety and the spread of the buffet. It will be nice if there are seafood selection like prawns and squid. For the price of the buffet, I would think it will be more value by adding a few more seafood items.
3
Tried their 1 for 1 buffet deal, but we will prefer having ala carte instead on the next visit as the A5 Miyazaki shin shin cut was too thin for BBQ. Do note that buffet is not inclusive of drinks (green tea/water) & 1-for-1 deal is only deducted after service charge is imposed. kurobuta steak, scallops, soy chicken are nice. Garlic chicken's rather salty
5
This is my 2nd time having BBQ buffet here. All meats and seafood are delicious, we ordered repeatedly the heavenly salmon with butter shoyu, fresh succulent scallops and wonderful beef slices. The miso soup with salmon was mouth-watering too. And not to forget the tasty Gomu (sesame) ice cream. Price is high but more worth it during one for one promotion.
5
Love the idea of their BBQ and their portion. Enjoy our meal there yesterday. Will definitely come back soon.
4
Food was good, service was excellent. Though an item wasn't available from their buffet menu, which should have been replaced with something else instead.
4
good service and nice atmosphere. do check with them if any dishes are unavailable on that day though. one of the a5 wagyu meats were not available when we were there.
3
Good quality meats but lack of choice for dipping sauce is a little disappointing and the sauce was pretty uninspiring. If not for the 1 for 1 promo, it's actually not worth it for the price you pay.
3
Only one type of Wagyu and quality was not that great. The rest of selection was ok. Not worth to pay if there was no 1-1 offer
4
beef was good..... only one kind of sauce.. wished there were more sauce as it get mono tonous after a while... they have promos and you should go for it when they have promos..
4
The only shortfall was the quality of the meat is inconsistent. Within 1 seating, there will be 2 orders of meat with little/No marbling... overall, great value.
3
Service: Staff was attentive and food ordered comes within 5 mins - good service Food: The quality of A5 waygu is lacking and it comes in thin slices. Choice of veges are only corn, mushrooms, leek, onion for grilling. The only leafy vege is kimchi which makes the meal feel abit too imbalanced. There is some seafood choices but nothing to scream for.Environment: The place is spacious and not too noisy, making having conversations pleasant as we didnt have to shout our replies at each other unlike other grill places. The grill is a thin stripe of metal that heats up and turns black after a few grills. This made the grilled meat and vege bitter after awhile and there wasn't any options for us to change the metal plate. Couldnt bring ourselves to continue grilling as food will just be bitter and wasted.Overall: I utilized the 1 for 1 buffet promo and still felt it is not worth the overall price tag for 100 per pax (had to top up for free flow beverages). Will not be returning at least till food quality/variety improves and the grilling equipment changed
3
We originally had booked a reservation through Eatigo, a Singapore app for local restaurants offering up nice discounts based when you dine. When we arrived for our reservation, the staff informed us that they actually had a better discount going than the one we booked, which was a nice offer and we took them up on it.Overall, the food and meal was adequate, but given the price, not entirely a great value. Like everyone else, we went for the A5 Miyazaki Wagyu beef buffet. But, like everyone else has mentioned here, they only had one type of Wagyu available, which I venture to guess wasn't entirely true (it just wasn't "available" for buffet patrons). The meat was OK, not great. I've had A5 Miyazaki all over the world, but the meat at Gyuu+ was inconsistent, alternative plate by plate from tender and melt-in-your-mouth to tough and chewy. Marbling was all over the place, too, which was disappointing. Slides were 6 to a plate, which isn't much. Overal, we paid around $120 total for two people. Had the quality of the meat been better, I'd recommend this place given that price. But, it was too inconsistent for me
4
Being a beef person, gyuu+ definitely satisfied my beef cravings by the high quality beef they had to offer! What's more is that even their side dishes and ice cream were such a treat! 4/5 as one of the A5 beef item wasn't available but other than that it is a lovely restaurant with high quality food, will definitely visit again.
5
Good food and customer service. The only issue was that the table was not set up before we were seated. Otherwise, good food and quick service in serving food.
3
Average food quality.. reasonable only if it's 1 for 1. Quality of Wagyu is consider average, too thinly sliced making it difficult to grill. The Kurobuta pork is disappointing. However I of the service crew has given his best service.
5
Food was amazing, although the place was crowded and the staff had to rush back and forth, they were very attentive and helpful.
4
The steak was good. Quite a fair share of variety of the beef selection.
The sesame and green tea ice cream was nice too.
2
The beef was disappointing. I lost my appetite and didn't get to try the pork. Hopefully it was better for other diners. I used the chope voucher and despite having paid for it, they wanted to charge me again.
4
The service was fast and very attentive. Tables are fully occupied. Need to make reservations as there's Queue over weekend.
4
Previous 1 for 1 deal is better. This round the choice of meats are lesser. But the good thing is quality of meat remains good.
5
We had trouble with our grill as our meats were getting stuck to the grill, the service staff Tan was very patient and after changing a grill plate for us, proceeded to demonstrate what the correct method was and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.
5
ordering was done through a tablet which is convenient and hassle free. service was prompt during lunch time. food came probably within 10mins after order was keyed in. quality of beef was top notch i must say. the ribeye and the shin shin is must try. sea food such scallops and salmon were fresh as well. That been said, price is on the steep side without the 1 for 1.
3
not the first time there especially when theres promo and hunger for meat...for 3 cuts of beef its not really attractive consider only 1 cut is wagyu n the other 2 are usda...ambience is good except its quite cold in there...have to top up for free flow drinks as well..
5
great buffet, have visited twice and would visit again.
food was great and thoroughly enjoyed my meal
4
Loved the kurobuta pork and wagyu beef. Sweet potato was good too. Rounded off with lovely mochi and green tea and sesame ice cream!
4
Meat served was of premium quality. We did enjoy the food. The staffs were responsive and friendly as well.
5
Went there for lunch. Food was of high quality and service was very pleasant.
Expect a spectacle outside the restaurant where there will be live seafood/meats on display.
5
Although it may look pricey, the food was worth every cent. Tried the Kurobuta Pork which was well marinated and extremely tender. Experienced great service from the friendly staff as well. Very spacious, quiet place.
3
The beef was sliced too thinly for yakiniku style bbq. We paid S$177 per tow pax (buffet), felt that it wasn't that worth it. Good ventilation. Service was good.
4
A good place for a group of meat eaters. Like the beef and the service staff was attentive. We were celebrating a birthday and they even sang a song. The only issue was there were 11 of us and they could not fit us all in one table so we had to split table. But the service staff was helpful with that too so we still enjoyed ourselves.
2
I went here twice within 2 months and had return 3 more times. It's sad to say that except the first 2 time and one more time which I ordered ala carte, the buffet with the on going promotion simply cannot make it.I like the food and the environment but, hate the feeling of being cheated. Maybe I still can go if I decided to eat ala cart
4
We had the a la carte instead of the buffet because we wanted items not in the buffet. The beef items were wonderful but to manage the bill, we ordered enough to try but not enough to be 100% full. Good to have satisfied a meat craving
3
To be fair, we've had A5 Hida beef in Japan and nothing else quite compares with it. Generally the only beef we felt was worth having is just to A5 Miyazaki beef. There are chicken, fish and pork options in the buffet, in addition to some appetizers that are also free flow. I guess for a 1-for-1 it's reasonable but I wouldn't recommend it highly.Service is efficient and the ordering of food from a tablet makes it very convenient.
5
1-1 promo is worth it as you can order 3 types of beef unlimited and the matcha ice cream was superb
5
Not only was the meat available of excellent quality, the staff were also friendly and quick to attend to our requests. If you're looking for somewhere with good food and ambience, Gyuu+ is the place to be!
5
Pros
Quality Beef
1 for 1 promo is value for money
good ambiance
Cons
Pricey if there's no promo
only few choices
4
If like me, you enjoy a good beef and good value this is a great place. They were having their 1st aniversery promo. Pay full price for the first dinner and the second one is just SGD1 . For A5 Miyazaki Wagyu and USDA Prime meets buffet you can't really go wrong. You just need to cook it yourself. It is a Yakiniku place after all. With the crowd, service would be affected. Wait staff running around like crazy when the dinner crowd got thick
4
Absolutely loved the meat, especially the A5 Miyakazi beef and the pork belly. Was lucky enough to get the 1-for-1 promotion, which made the experience more memorable. A pity though, that there is a 1.5hour time limit. While we definitely finished within the time limit, knowing there was one placed a pressure on us to complete our meal, which took some of the pleasure out of the experience.
3
We went there for the buffet and the menu contain mostly meat. There is no vegetable selection. The meat choice is also limited. There is also time limit for buffet (90mins) and the time start by the time you booked (plus 10mins grace) even if you arrive later than 10mins from your booking time. This is only good for Meat lover plus fast eater, cos you wont have time to relax and enjoy the food.One plus point is the ice cream is really good
5
Ordered the premium cut platters for different kinds of beef: sirloin and ribeye. Good taste and delicious. Meat was tender and juicy. Better quality than the Buffet spread. Might cost a bit more but good value. Wish they had more set noodle or rice set to go with the meat. Must booked as place is crowded even on weeknights
3
There was only 3 types of beef offered for buffet although their ala carte menu showed more varieties. Out of the limited 3 types, only the A5 Miyazaki ShinShin was good as the other two were so tough we could not even bite it through using our teeth. This is despite only cooking each side for "a few seconds" as instructed by the staff. For seafood, there was only Shishamo (small slim type of fish), scallop and Salmon fillet. I must say though that the scallops and salmon were both delicious. The original price was $108 per person but even though we had the 1-for-1 promotion, the price still worked out to about $71 per person (tax & service charged included), therefore for this amount, I would have expected a bigger spread if it is termed as "Buffet". There was also no prawns nor squids being offered in the buffet menu!Another disappointing fact was when we clicked on the iPad to order Chawanmushi, the order went through but after a long while, none came. It was only upon asking the staff that we were told that the item was sold out! Our reservation was at 6:30pm which I feel was already an early timing for dinner. Even if this item had been "sold out" the staff should have notified us at the start of ordering or even upon our ordering, but nothing happened :<For dessert, there was only 2 types of ice cream, namely matcha or black sesame. Both types were good. :

The 1-for-1 promotion was really good value for the buffet. Undoubtedly the top draws are the quality premium meats for yakiniku especially the A5 Miyazaki, USDA Prime and Aussie Wagyu beef. If you miss the top-grade Japanese beef, this is the place to satisfy your craving. The lesser attractions are the chicken, pork, scallop and salmon - all of which we enjoyed tremendously. I feel the low point is the limited variety - perhaps the management should consider adding more vegetables and seafood items.We had a really watered down soft drinks but the staff was so kind to exchange them for us. Kudos to them. Another small improvement I would suggest is to change the type of grills. The current grill had wide gratings like zebra crossings whereas the netting-type of grill would be more suitable. Overall a good value promotion buffet, nice cost restaurant with friendly staff and good suction to keep out the smoke from the grills.

Went there on a monday night with my family.The place was quite packed despite it being a monday. We took the buffet.Variety not as great as I wanted. But the beef was nicely marinated and very yummy.Hardly any seafood available, only scallop was offered. Not too many vegetables choices given also.The ice cream was very nice. Both the green tea and black sesame flavours were great

My advice, stick to the beef. Not because everything else is bad, but because the beef is so good! We dined on a 1-for-1 promotion, so overall was pretty good value for money. Would definitely go again.

Steak is tender and juicy . the portion of pettie fillies is just nice for girls. Dessert is too big portion better to share with family

both pork and beef were good. side items such as onions and scallops and mushrooms were pretty delicious as well. ice cream had too little variety for the buffet though. good value as it was 1 for 1.

Meat is delicious, the concept is really fun. Salmon on bbq was also very good, less so the scallops. Recommended

The beef was really good and they had a buffet promotion going on now which is worth it. I would go back again.

Didnt want to choose the buffet option as we didnt eat much and didnt want to waste $ and food. the beef platter was enjoyable. The shio pork belly was quite unremarkable. For the price at experience, there is elsewhere I'll prefer

We went there for lunch on a Saturday. I have an OCBC Card and so enjoyed 30% discount. Promotion till end Oct. Service was very good. A Singaporean "chef" , helped us cook the Miyazaki. He must have seen me fumbling and not want to spoil a good beef. We enjoyed the beef so much that we brought our friends for the eat all you can beef buffet on the same evening. Our friends enjoyed themselves. Time limit is one hour. But we'd no problems. Food was served very fast even though at some point there was a problem with the WiFi as ordering is through Internet.

Don't be fooled by the ratings online like me. The quality of the meat is not worth the price paid. The highlight of the buffet is wagyu, but turn out to be tough n full of tendon which make it hard to chew (taste like rubber ). The pork is inedible, the 'porky ' taste is so strong. Nothing memorable. The range of meat n other dishes is limited also. Is definitely overpriced, will not return agn

I went to GYUU+ for my mum√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s birthday celebration and we have the A5 Miyzaki buffet. We had platters and platters of beef including A5 Miyazaki and USDA karubi. My brothers enjoyed the beef, it was fresh and of good grade. We had our fill of meats, even the garlic chicken taste awesome with their seasoning. We had lots of meat and japan-imported vegetables and desserts. The GYUU+ team was also very sweet to prepare a cake for my mum. We had a great celebration all thanks to the team wonderful service and great food
