I had the Christmas special set of turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. It came with soup and a drink. The sandwich was tasty and the fries good. A good place for a quick lunch.

Coffee served here is decent at an acceptable price. Apart from coffee, also serves finger food and lunch. Only 2 tables on the inside, other tables are outside. I had the iced toffee nut latte. Taste good. Not too sweet, not bitter either.

We waited a long time to place the order. Reasonably long to get the food. Taste and quality were ok, typical for quick service at lunch time. Average for area.

Nothing I love more than walking into a cafe and the know what a real coffee is, ristretto, flat white etc etc. just like Melbourne
Well executed and nice style!
I will be back for a caffeine hit again!!

We came here on Friday lunch time, when almost 80% of the tables are filled.We ordered a sandwich & a pasta set. The sandwich came 10 minutes later, but the pasta took at least half an hour. I had the soft bread with the truffle mushroom, but didn't like the taste and the bread tasted like those cheap bread you could get from traditional bakery shops. Pumpkin soup had too much cream or milk, and didn't taste like pumpkin soup.The other side dish we ordered never turn up. We were told it was not included in the order though we were sure we ordered it and they wrote it down. However, when we were about to leave, the side dish was served but we didn't want it anymore.The side dish appeared on the bill, and fortunately we had the habit of checking the detail or we would have been charged for some thing we never had.Considering the unpleasant experience, long wait & not so great food, there is no reason to return to this place

We booked last minute and it took a little while to find this little cafe. We went early evening with a toddler.The menu isn't huge, but has plenty of choice. We all chose the burger! We also got some truffle fries (we shared some of the food with our daughter as they didn't have the soup of the day and no children's meals).The burgers were juicy and well cooked. Fries were ok fries, the dish was served on a wooden plank and the fries in a little basket.I had a coffee, flat white which was good.The kitchen closes at 7.30pm so this is a day to me, early evening venue. They are currently doing some works so the cafe is surrounded by white boards between there outdoor tables and the couple of inside tables.I'd go again if I fancied a burger (other food options are available!)

I was a regular this restaurant from 2010 through 2015 and I'm always happy to renew my acquaintance whenever I am in town. It is a popular spot in Biopolis, serving excellent quality low-mid-priced meals. This protects it somewhat from the noontime surge of cheap-eats folks but it still fills up quickly and service can get a little congested at peak hour. The menu includes many local traditional favorites but also has one of the best sandwich plus soup-or-salad-or-french fries menus in the region. My perennial favorite: the grilled fish sandwich, but the deep fried fish sandwich is also very good, and their burgers are definitely memorable

We went there with our two year old after his school event. We had the baked rice, seafood pasta and burger. The burger seems to be the favorite for us (as well as most diners). The mains were around $15 each. Pretty nice place to chill out with the family on Fri.

Long Black is a nice options from time to time when you are ready to spend ~$15 for lunch around Biopolis, instead of the ~$5 at Mealbox.They have a good selection of dishes from salads to pasta and sandwiches. For me, the burgers are good and of good value. You get a good quality beef patty, nice sweet buns and the right amount of veggies there. The side dish of wedge potatoes are also good. When I am here, I order this 80% of the time.Service wise, the place is just ok and it depends on the sever and how packed they are. The Filipino servers are good and will attend to you in a nice way, most of the time with a smile or at least not with a pouting face. So, don't come after 12nn if you are already very hungry

Just had lunch with colleagues. The set lunch was reasonably priced and consisted of soup, main and drink. The main can be from the special set lunch or from the ala carte menu. I had the Seared Rib-eye salad while my colleagues ordered Ocean catch, an assortment of fried seafood (prawns, squids and fish) with fries, Chef a Fishwich, Chicken pesto pasta and chicken burger. The soup was pumpkin soup. The portion of the main is huge. The sandwich and burger came with salad and fries on the side. The food tasted good and it's good value for the price of $14.50 to $15.50 per set
