Once a poor manâ€™s meal, it is now a delicacy eaten with side dishes like fried radish egg, stewed pork slices with salted vegetables, stir-fry venison with ginger and spring onions, fried black pomfret in black bean sauce and many others depending on your choices and taste. Located in an area where many food outlets can be found, it holds its own clientele. It is a suitable meal if you want a light lunch or dinner. The dishes are pretty good and service is fast and friendly. Place is an old style air-con restaurant, typically Chinese! Highly recommended by gourmands. Worth trying if you are in the area. Otherwise try it at their other outlet at ABC Brickworks Food Centre

Went to try out on 2nd October 2017, the place was very packed.Service was good and the food was decent.However frankly speaking the price is not really affordable.Our bill came up to 80 plus SGD dollars for 5 people which to be honest I feel it's very overrated. For this price I can think of cheaper and better alternatives

Have been a regular patron whenever I visit the TCM clinic nearby at Kembangan Plaza. It serves typical "zi-char Chinese dishes" with porridge, instead of just offering rice. Some of our favourite dishes include "pork rib king", stir fried vegetables, egg omelette and pork liver in claypot. They have more than 100 dishes to choose from. The food is not salty and not too oily. The small portion of each dish is good for 3 persons when u order 3-4 dishes. We typically spent less than $15 per pax, inclusive of a drink. The service is friendly and they are open till late. A nice restaurant to visit when you are in the east side of Singapore and needs a warm comforting bowl of hot porridge. A plus point: There is parking right in front of the restaurant.

Gu Zao Ren has always been a family favorite for us, do try their salted egg chicken, sweet potato porridge. Prices are fair and variety is plenty. Was searching aimlessly for Chinese food during CNY and is surprised to see them open! 10am to 12 midnight, solves quite a few of the food issues throughout this festive period.

This place offers potato porridge with an assortment of dishes such as vegetables, beef, chicken, fish, pork, etc. There are many variations on the menu to choose from, such as bean sprouts with salted fish, black pepper beef/chicken/pork, omelette with chye poh, salted egg chicken and more. It's not a big place, so expect crowds on weekends. If you love potato bits in your plain porridge, do check out this place!

Gu Zao Ren & Taiwan Porridge serves standard Chinese dishes plus Taiwan porridge. Food is tasty. Portion is small but reasonable for the price of $8 onward for a small meat dish. Standard stuff like noodles/fried rice from $4.50. Service is fast but may get crowded at night especially during weekends. There are tables both inside air cond and outdoor. Not a big restaurant but suitable for quick meal
