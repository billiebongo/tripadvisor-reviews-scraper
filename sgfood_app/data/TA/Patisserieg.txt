Situated in a large shopping complex, Patisiere G is a welcome stop. Beautiful cakes and pastries (SGD$4.50 +). This cafe also serves ciabatta sandwiches (SGD8.80). The coffee is very good. Very relaxing and pleasant location to relax and enjoy a bite to eat.

Came here for lunch last week with a colleague and opted for the parma ham toasted ciabatta. All quite tasty and fairly efficient service too. A bit of a pain to have to line up and order, but otherwise all good.

This time I tried the smoked salmon sandwich and opted for the fries as the side dish. It took quite a while to prepare this time, even though we ordered quite early (before 12) and there weren't many people there. But the sandwich was fine, although personally I think the parma ham sandwich is better

My "go to" place whenever I need a good coffee. Ordered a piccolo latte and also a ham croissant for breakfast. The coffee was excellent - not sure what beans they use but it is really smooth and leaves no sour after taste. Their croissants are simply the best. Buttery but yet light baked fresh

Returned to Patisserie G today for another of the parma ham ciabattas, this time with a small side salad (+$1.50). Today there was a bit of a queue for service, but it moved fairly quickly. They give you a buzzer thing which alerts once the food is ready. Tasty ciabatta and didn't have to wait too long. Good for a quick lunch

I really needed something other than hotel fare. We found this place in the Millenial Walk Mall, near the Sun Tec center and Fountain of Wealth. It was a huge almost English breakfast (sans beans, tomatoes and kippers ... ok, so not so UK, more US) ... too much to eat but very satisfactory. One breakfast platter could easily feed 2. In the mall, but before shops open, so not a zoo

Never have I tasted such a party in my mouth . Layers after layers of sweet, bitter, tangy, savory, texture, crunch. Pleasantly surprised. Great pastry to match those in Manhattan. Chocolate Caramel Tart. Amazing. Although I would prefer the cookie base to be graham cracker and softer. The Tropical has Banana Marmalade and Coconut Chantilly! Who would have guessed! Very good sweets

If youâ€™re a cake lover, then PatisserieG is cake heaven! Their cakes, called 'gateaux' comes in different flavours yet each of them is unique in its own. For the ultimate yum, hit The G Spot. Made up of layers of chocolate, this magical creation will give an explosion of flavours in your mouth! If not, just simply get coffee or tea and sit on the outdoor area while you watch shoppers pass by

I was expecting more to be honest, the French hot chocolate was divine, but there are better desserts elsewhere. The $3 macaroons were definitely not worth it, while the taste of the salted caramel was great, they tasted a little stale. :(Having said that, presentation was top-notch

Went there on a free day and sat for a longer while this time. Slowly took my time to savor the beautifully crafted cakes. Since the closing of the Palais branch of Antoinette, I haven't had the chance to visit the other branch and enjoy such delicately-made cakes. I think G does satisfy that craving. However, I must emphasize that the coffee is STILL really bad
