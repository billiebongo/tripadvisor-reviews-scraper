One of my top lunch places. Get the burrito bowl. You will spend around$12- $15 per meal if you get one burrito bowl with a drink. Add some condiments for more stronger taste!

I normally order this restaurant from Uber eats. Always quick and fresh! Love all the menu, especially mini burritos and bowls. Only disappointment was the regular size barramundi burritos which was like 90% barramundi which made me sick eating it. Go for the mini if you crave for the fish, of if the management is reading this I hope they change the portioning of the fish for regular size. It may be worth the price but makes me not want to order it again

The burrito (pork by default but there is plenty of customisation available) is really great tasting and the portion is really decent. It is really peaceful (without much queues) if you choose to come for dinner (as compared to lunch). Today the order was for beef (top up $0.50) but somehow pork was served instead. Not a big issue as the food preparers may have made a genuine mistake.Also if you are driving, do bring your receipt for verification with the security guard at level 1 if your purchase qualifies for free parking

IPricier than my usual dinner menu, but definitely value for money due to the serving size. And healthier too. Menu is quite wide in variety but I felt the ingredients are interrelated and seem monotonous. Anyway, it was worth the try. I chose the fajita chicken bowl and a can of lemon tea. It was just right in terms of spice and quantity. Tomatos, lettuce, cheese, black beans, green pepper and some nacho chips with sour cream. Healthy alternative. Service is very good. Attentive order taking and quick cashier. Good meal.

This is strangely an Australian-Mexican chain that is now expanding into Asia. They're supposed to go for a more Mexican flavour, with rich, marinated-for-a-week meats and savoury flavours from black beans, mexican rice and vinegar, unlike the usual sweet and creamy flavours of most tex-mex style chains. However, something had gone horribly wrong here - the chicken seemed to have been cooked with no spices at all and, although I ordered spicy chicken and the receipt said spicy chicken, what I actually got would rate below mild. Management and training can't be too good at this branch because, when done properly, Guzman's one of the best Mexican imitators outside of North America (and the Tokyo branch I visited did it right)

Frequently patronise Guzmans at the Asia Swuare food hall. The tacos and enchiladas always make a good lunch meal. Have not been dissatisfied with my purchase thus far. What it's short on is probably the vegetable aspect of things. And be ware of the ultra spicy sauce. I love it but do take it in controlled proportions. Enjoy

Popped in for lunch and decided on Nachos, the menu has lots of choice. Even though it was busy I only waited 5 mins max for it be delivered fresh. Good size portion for the money too and the girl who served me was really knowledgeable and helpful
4
Every now and then, when I crave for some tacos, Guzman is the place where I go to. While this is more a food court, I really don't mind it at all. The ingredients are nice and fresh. A set of 3 tacos and a soft drink will set you back around $15.

I'm a bit biased as I am from Southern California. Where we have the best Mexican food. This food is on a chipotle status. Which I am not a fan of. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't so great. Personally, I won't visit this place again
4
Decent food. Standard price is just about ok, if you want to add extras becomes a little expensive but that's with all the food in Asia Square. Food is good, service is good and usually pretty fast. Had lunch here several times, always same standard and never had any issues

Gyg's burrito bowl is one of the best lunch options in the area, especially after a hard workout. I always stick to the beef and I have never been disappointed. My only gripe: portion is a bit small for the price.

Each time I dont get my tiffin, I visit this place for lunch. I just love the burritos served here, especially the way the kidney beans are marinated in the sauce, also, the avocado sauce is yummy. The service is pretty swift too.

Tasty option for anyone craving Mexican food and clean food. I like the burrito bowl option. The beef and pork are both good.

didn't expect to find good mexican food in a food court in singapore. the soft tacos are very good and not too expensive

Are you kidding me. Wanted a quick healthier dinner after work, & like GyG in oz. when I got my spicy chicken burrito bowl with guacamole hole I had to play "find the chicken & find the guacamole". What a pathetically small serve, missing its core pieces. Much better options out there. Not again

I could not find the MappleTree Business city (MBC) outlet listed. Hence posting the review here under Asia square. The placed oped up couple of days back in MBC in the newly renovated food court. It is located at the very end of the site and is almost invisible currently. May be when the whole renovation is completed they will be more viable. We were a group of 6 people visiting for lunch. The place was fully packed and it was difficult to find place to sit & eat. There were many people taking take away as well. The menu is quite simple with regular Mexican dishes. The menu displayed above the cashier is bit confusing. Its easier to understand on the pamphlets. There was a bit of confusion while placing the order and the person taking the order didn't really give me all the items that I was expecting. The kitchen is compact and many of the stuff served is in the category of fast food / quick bites category. I would have liked the dishes to be served hot to make the experience more better. The quantity is good and taste is decent. You can chose to add toppings like onions, chopped coriander and jelepino slices free of cost. There are also 3 levels of sauce. I tried medium and extra spicy ones. The spicy one was really spice and complimented well with the mild flavor of my main dish. The decor is quite good and has a nice feel to it. Sine the place is very close to my current workplace, i will surely visit it again. Addition of Mexican food is a good choice as it adds variety to other existing food options. Hopefully I will be able to find food served bit hotter than the current state. If you prefer Mexican please give it a try.

We do regular takeaway from Guzman and. Food is outstanding with multiple vegetarian choices . My colleagues find the non veg stuff decent as well . Cons : It's tough to eat there ( can't find a place to sit during lunch hours ) . And I wish they would follow instructions when asked to keep mushrooms out of he food !

Stumbled on this small fast foodish restaurant a few weeks back. Don't let the simple decor fool you. The food is awesome! Had the soft fish tacos and the pulled pork burritos both were excellent. The Mexican beers also are a big plus. Will definitely be a regular at this place
5
Can't ask for more, hard tacos are so good, I would order 3 just for myself. When I used to work nearby, I'll visit once a week and it has been my go-to place for comfort food ever since. Any filling tastes great, go for the vegetable so you can get free guacamole. Their iced lemon tea is really refreshing too
5
The hard tacos are amazing; slow grilled & spicy pork/chicken, steak, the fish one is outstanding and would pair nicely with some white wine. Their sauces too have great flavor& heat. In Singapore they are in a food court but in Australia their outlets have a relaxed ambience and serve chilled Coronas & frozen margaritas..

I work nearby so come here for lunch maybe once a month... Pretty tasty and not too expensive... Had the burrito once but really prefer the tacos which come hard or soft shell...
4
The burrito I had was very tasty, and fresh. The food was on the expensive side. The habanero sauce is a must try if you like spicy food.

While the
Burritos tasted
All right. It's too expensive
To just eat these burritos. Money could be better
Spent at the caf√©s below.. Pity!

So wonderful to have authentic Mexican fast food - the mini burrito with spicy beef was excellent - soft taco fish was so so cos the fish was a bit fishy - pulled pork was great and best of all the choice of chilli sauces - burnners on tap! They also served excellent margaritas!Only things I miss that they don't have .... yet.... are chimicangas & hot tamales

This is the first time I am trying its taco. I ordered the popular,mild spicy chicken, small size. (it comes in two sizes)The chicken was tasty and not oily. Great for those on clean protein diet! The place was buzzing with people and the kitchen staff were cheerful. The place had a fun and casual atmosphere.Good to see that the menu caters to glutten free diet as well

Wanted to try something different in this huge food court called Asia square and Mexican seemed like an interesting option. Was so disappointed with the Burrito I ordered (14 dollars), was it a good meal I would not have mind the money but it was really bad, burrito has very little chicken and was filled with sauce beans and huge quantity of rice.This is not a kinda of burrito I have had in past and don't expect to pay S$14 for rice rolls!!!

Craving for reasonably priced Mexican food? then this is the place. These guys do a great job in preparing the burritos and the tacos with mouth watering ingredients. The filling options range from chicken, beef, pork etc and the price range is around $12, you can even get a Salsa on the side for $3. Not pricey at all for the kind of food served. As for how they serve, you can either make it a To-Go or have it in the shared dining area of Asia Square Food Garden. My work place is nearby so honestly I've been one of the regulars in here as I love Mexican food. Happy lunching

First of all when we arrived there was only a young lady attending customers so it took a while to be served. Second we asked for nachos with only cheese but it was not possible: only full of stuff otherwise only nachos: very low flexibility. Then at 1430h there were no more paper towels in the all shop as the lady told us that they only replenish them in the morning.Only good note is that the portions for the nachos meet was quite large; on the other side the portion for the quesadillas were quite ridicoulous.Finally me and my son both felt sick after a couple of hours having difficulties in digesting and having to bowel heavily.Not a good day Guzman y Gomez: today you lost a customer !!

we all crave mexican food now and then, and in singapore its not as readily accessible as say noodles and burgers and other fun filled msg stuff...this place is located in asia square, finance area, cbd, so one would expect a certain level of quality.... they got the over charging people price correct since being in the cbd they must do that... but the food wow.... burritos, burritos in a bowl, they come warm not hot, all they had is mostly rice, scarce beans,onions,tomatoes....and thats 10.50$ their salsa is nasty, they have a dispenser that u can pump out 3 types of hot sauce mild, medium, hot... the mild one looks like green slime, the other two brown diarrhoea after a night of curry previously.... the flavor is all off!!! for an extra 3.00$ you can buy salsa on the side.basically its the dispensible hot sauce mixed in variou combinations or a pot of tomatoes (mild salsa)i would make the extra effort to look for another mexican restaurant if it meant taking an extra 30mins... travellingthe pro of this place.. good cutlery probably the only fast food place you will find in singapore that will give u a knife... and its made out of wood

Asia Square was a decent replacement while Lau Pa Sat was closed and Guzman Y Gomez does a decent burrito for Singapore...I haven't found great Mexican food anywhere in Singapore. It is a counter pickup and you eat in the food garden seating area (better chope a table at lunch time, it gets very busy). The burritos are available in various meats and veggie types, there are several good hot sauces available to pour or dip. The burritos run about $11 for not a very big but quite adequate burrito
