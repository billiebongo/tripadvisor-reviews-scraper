Very slow service, waited over an hour for a call which did not come, food is decent but but was overcharged as they serve you much more than you order without telling you upfront. Leaves a bad after taste in my mouth.

Meat meat meat and more meat. But sadly not all meat are equal. Recommend the beef ribs and the beef brisket. The mash was incredible as well. Good range of beer to go along. Only issue - pricey.

A hipster joint that serves succulent meats that are smoke low and slow for up to 12 hours.
Great place for those who need to load up your proteins.

Have been there with friends. Not to hard to find but the place is a bit small so do arrive early to avoid crowd. They have a bunch of selection of meats. We have tried several and there were tasty and nice! We will come back again next time.

I remember eating short rib from this smokehouse over a year ago. My friend brought it to a potluck. It was mindblowing, and I don't remember anything else I ate that evening. I finally made it to the restaurant last Friday, to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff was visibly stretched and busy, but still kindly accommodated to my request to swap tables and store a cake for my friend. The corn bread and mash was absolutely amazing that we ordered seconds. The quality of the meat was somewhat inconsistent that night. We were disappointed with their signature US brandt beef brisket, something we ordered to add on to our platter after hearing so much about it. It was unfortunately, very dry. The sausage tasted raw and undercooked, but we were reassured by the staff that it was cooked through, just that there's lots of fat in it. The huli huli chicken and short rib were favourites, while the vote for the rest of the items on the platter was mixed amongst the 4 of us. I have heard and read a lot of good things about this restaurant. I am confident that it is good. Just that perhaps, we were there on an off night? Despite the hits and misses, we still had a really good evening, and enjoyed ourselves. We'll pick and choose our own meat rather than have the platter the next time we come by

I knew something was good the moment I stepped out of the uber. The smell was exactly the same as "Couch's" BBQ in Cleveland TN USA. Which is a side-of-the-road classic american bbq place that I've eaten at for 30 years. We had decided based on the TV5 review to give the place a try. We had 4 voluteer's, 3 true meat eaters and one mostly rabbit. :) We order the platter plus one, with lots of sides. The beans, sweat potatoes, slaw, brocolli, and all the meats. Actually we had complaints we were oooh and ahing so much from how good the meat was. The ribs were better than Hard Rock Cafe we had during Christmas, (Even better than what I remember Tony Roma's being like), the pulled pork was also just like home. I found out later they provide slider buns if you want to go traditional. I loved everything except the sausage. Its a hard act to follow for the sausage because all the rest is really world class. The beans which are called burnt end beans have such a wonderful seasoning that you cannot stop eating it. The slaw likewise was worthy of a arm-wrestle, but the part that we had the most competition for was the pickles. Home made chucky dill pickles. Really good. We also tried the cream soda, have to say it was good, it was the only thing I think the price was a bit high on, the rest of the meal was good value for money, and I will be going back really soon (Maybe this weekend even)

The Red Eye BBQ Plate for 2-3 people was just nice for our family of four. The Macho Nachos was worth the try. The downside is that some items are spicy so my younger one was not able to eat much. The Bone Marrow Butter Mashed Potatoes, pulled pork and the sweet potato fries were my girlâ€™s favourite. Beside the bottle of plain water served, there are no suitable drinks for the children

My visit to this restaurant was nearly marred by a service error..after waiting over half an hour for our food we found out from the waiter that our order was not recorded properly and sent to the kitchen (they had a rather primitive way of taking orders with 1 waiter holding a notebook being overwhelmed by a dozen customers during a Saturday evening peak hour). The management's response was praiseworthy however, as they did not try to shirk responsibility, acknowledged their mistake and offered us a few measures to make up for it.Other than this, the food was pretty decent, with the pork belly and beef plate worth a shoutout.Would come here agai

This is the best BBQ and one of the best restaurants in Singapore. It is right next to the Jalan Besar Stadium, on a quiet side street. The post modern industrial deco is in sharp contrast with the traditional and comfortable BBQ food served here. The menu is written on the wall that caters to individuals and family sizes. The root beer ($7) from west coast microbrewery is outstanding. We ordered a platter for 2-3 ($65) that comes with two sides. The BBQ pork, roast pork, roast beef, buffalo chicken wing and sausages were amazingly tender and tasteful. The only desert available is key lime pie and it is heavenly. Everything in this smokehouse is just to die for. And to top it off, there is no 7% GST and 10% tipping charge as service is kept minimal. It has been around for only two years but I have a feeling that it is hear to stay for a long time to come

A hipster bbq restaurant. Ordered the platter for 2-3 pax at $65 nett. Great value of money for the amount of food. Place was busy with only a few spare tables behind.Pulled pork was good, sausages & pork belly were average, beef brisket was too fatty, chicken wings were delish. Sides of coleslaw and beans were good. Service was friendly. Has to doggie-bag some of the food as we could not finish. Reasonable price was the best part of the meal

We went there following a recommendation and didn't get disappointed.
We got excellent food in an interesting location.

Loved it! Very kind staff and best American BBQ we had in Asia. Highly recomended! The Macho Nacho is heaven too!

Popped in here for a light dinner recently with a friend. The pulled pork was really good but the beef brisket was a little fatty for my liking. Unfortunately we just missed the happy hour where you get 2 pints of beer for just $14++ which is excellent value. Will have to come back to take advantage of that for sure

I took a big whiff when I entered the restaurant and I knew this was a real BBQ joint, the smell of smoked meats brought me right back to the states. The menu is on the board and the gorgeous BBQ meats are at the counter, ready to be served. The Brandt Brisket was super tender, the Short Rib was nicely marbled and fork tender. We also loved the Huli Huli Chicken. Definitely a place for meatheads

If you love meat, good meat, meat prepared very very well, good quality meat, lotsa meat, this is the place for you.Non biased, no reservation entitled unless you are a party of 6 and more, menu's on the wall, no long waiting time, no frills.And you would think that their mains are all meat and they don't give two hoots about their sides. Wait till you try their mashed potatoes and coleslaw, all fresh, delicious, and crunchy veg just couldn't get you stopping. We only have all praises for their food.Could get a little claustrophobic when it's a full house, but otherwise a very very nice place to be

Just had dinner there and while the price is not cheap, the quality of the food was really good. I had the pork ribs, beef brisket and shirt ribs along with marrow mash potatoes, coleslaw and broccoli salad. The beef brisket was out of the world. It was soft, tender and so succulent. I was tempted to buy 1 kg worth of it because it was that good. The beef short ribs and all the sides were excellent but it was just overshadowed by the brisket. The ribs were all right but that could be due to the excellent quality of the other meats. The owner must love American bbq because it's back breaking work and I will be back here again, this time with some Americans in tow who miss their bbq

Staff were friendly and the menu was classic to a traditional Texas Smokehouse, and all the key meats and sides were covered in this newly furbished outfit. Decor and buzzing ambiance aside, it was the little things, that to a BBQ enthusiast like myself, that really stand out and clearly get noticed in the end product. They're using a pellet smoker, and this was noticeable in the taste; the meat didn't have a great bark or that intense Smokey flavour you get from a pure wood log smoker; I can however get past this! That said, I as dumbfounded and found it absolutely criminal that they go to the effort of smoking big meats for over 8-10hrs until it's reached that juicy perfection, only to then put the product open and unwrapped in a glass, lamp heated service-pass to keep it warm... SOOOO disappointing, I felt bad for the restaurant, it was their only flaw. It resulted in a dry, chewy meat that was tough (Pork Belly and Ribs specifically); easily resolved with an investment into some standard Cambro Hot Boxes!! For those that don't know any better, you should definitely trythis joint, and I recommend the Brisket!

The place is hidden away on a side street and you must be looking for it to find it. Basic setup with ordering at the counter and the meats are weighed and charged per 100gr. It was tasty and a good place to get our southern bbq fix. I would recommend to put a little more decor and a little better service (eg. ordered ice tea and we had to ask for it after our food arrived). The brisket was very nice and well prepared

Went there twice so far. The first time was much more memorable as I didn't have smoked meat for a terribly Long time. The meats were cooked well and I loved the broccoli and coleslaw side.I tried as many as I could and ordered the pork ribs, beef short ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket and sausages. THe beef short ribs were brilliant and on the TOP of my list, the pork ribs were hard probably because it got cold, the pulled pork was forgettable as it was slightly too hard for my liking, but the sausages were tasty and filling. The brisket was soft and chewy the first time round but the second time it wasn't as good.Overall I'm still giving this a five as there isn't other place that offers anything close that I've tried.Service was great too !!Price ? It ranges from $40-60 per person depending on how much you can eat.

A paradise for meat lovers.. it was indeed love at first bite. Saw this place in Burple and wanted to check it out. The place has a nice industrial feel and the best thing is it was not crowded at all. The staff were real attentive they made great recommendations. We had the platter for 2-3 people and it was huge. There were 4 of us and we find the portion to be just right. We also tried their Nachos and it was heaven in my tongue. It had the right crisp, creaminess and kick that we went gaga for. The meats, though grilled, was tender and oh-so-juicy; its a must-try. They also offer happy hour with 1 for 1 draft beer. They too have a wide selection of beverage, some I have never encountered. The place wasn't hard to find too. It was a mere 2 blocks away from Lavender stn and just near Jln Besar Stadium. I would highly recommend this place. Its perfect for dates, friend's hang outs or simple cheat days... its such a gastronomic feast! Kudos

Imported hickory wood, the right amount of smoke, and fall off the bone meat. Nice environment and friendly staff. Check it out!

Yum yum yum
The beef and pork belly was so tasty and also the condiments, washed down with a nice beer in a relaxed warehouse style decor.

Recently I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant three times.
All three were brilliant. I had great food in a relaxed atmosphere.
The platters were wonderful.
4
We visited with a group of 6 for dinner. The service was great and the food prepared very quickly. We thought the beef brisket was excellent and the pulled pork very good. The pork ribs and sausage we will skip next time.

This place is AMAZING. The best BBQ food I have had in the two years I have been in Singapore and for a really reasonable price. For $90 we got a plethora of meats (they do different pre-made plates), sweet potato poutine, 4 different sides and key lime pie. All of which were utterly delicious. They make their own sauces and rubs and everything we had was perfectly cooked! Highly recommend the brisket, ribs and wings as well as the MAC and cheese. Will be back here for sure! Service was also brilliant throughout!
5
The beef brisket and the beef rib were awesome. Pork belly was a little dry. For sides, we had the mac N cheese and honey corn bread. The mac and cheese is good. The kids liked it.The favorite round the table was the beef brisket but my personal fav was the beef rib. The beef rib was super moist and flavoursome.Choice of 2 BBQ sauces - smiley chipotle and sweet and tangy.Key lime pie was also good.
5
The servings are generous and for such high quality meat, it's worth every dollar!To say the meat is melt-in-your-mouth is such an understatement. The side dishes like Maple corn bread with honey butter is exquisite!I love every bite and everything on the menu.The restaurant is loud and busy as expected for Saturday night but the service is awesome and friendly.Best come early (and with reservation) before some menus got sold out

We ordered a variety of the meats. The Beef Brisket and Beef Short Ribs were pretty good. The corn bread was also good probably because it was sweet! The sweet potato fries were also good. The rest of the meats were average. The chicken has room for some improvement though. Overall... Worth a visit at least once if only for the Brisket, Short Ribs and corn bread and sweet potato fries.

Wonderful barbecue meats and great sides in a very casual unpretentious restaurant. Fine to tuck into the finger lickin' food with abandonment. Highly recommend the beef brisket which was just superb! The corn bread with honey butter was addictive. Ask for the buns and pickles which are only on request. They complement the meats well. The taco sandwich was seen to have been enjoyed thoroughly. Macho nachos with pulled pork was great. Candied yams and Cole slaw are must tries. Service was friendly and helpful.
