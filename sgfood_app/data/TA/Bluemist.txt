Bluemist small, lively and a place to laugh and chat. Call in and smiling faces greet you, asking what you wish. as soon as your glass empties a quiet request if a refill is required or a snack of meal ........ meet Joel - she is a smiling chatty delight who always finds time to share a laugh and making sure you are not taking life too seriously - a joy at the end of heavy day!

No surprises - expect the standard gastropub grub and beers here. Friendly proprietress will get on first-name terms with you if you come often enough.Affordable prices, relative to nearby cafes. With bigger servings to boot. Runs a very happy hour too.Your best bet for a quick drink over lunch

Been coming here regularly for over 2 years now still remains one of my go-to spots for good variety of draught beers ($11/ $10HH) and cheap finger bites. Close to the city core makes it a great place for a quick after work beer, hence why this place is packed most weeknights. Good service friendly staff

We came here for drinks only. Lots of good beers to choose from but there is very limited wine and it's not so good! They definitely need to improve the wine selection. They have good specials and happy hour prices. Typical bar food. The bathroom is unique - be prepared to wait in line for it - and bring a camera

Decent food, decent service. Great that their kitchen is open until midnight (maybe just weekends â€“ we didn't check). This street in Tanjong Pagar is dominated by Korean and Japanese restaurants. So if you feel like having something different, Bluemist is one of the places you can try

In Singapore for a business meeting and dropped into Blue Mist for a quick lunch. Great food, outstanding service and a cool vibe created by the PA music - ranging from James Blunt to Joe Cocker. Fully recommended, two thumbs up! Thank you, Blue Mist. I'll be back for sure. I am a non-drinker, but another patron told me that the beer selection is very good also

I love the Guinness stout beer that is served from the house tap. It's superb fluffy and it's only available here. Those sold in the supermarket or convenient store in bottle are no matched. They also serve good food and nice drinks at a reasonable price
