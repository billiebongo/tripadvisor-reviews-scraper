The deep fried branched skin ship with minced meat was sooooooo good. Crispy n generous portion of filling... Delicious.
The saut√©ed Kaplan with assorted mushrooms was very prepared. Just the right tenderness of the kailan

I had the pleasure of eating here around 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon. The service was prompt, the food quick and very tasty. We loved the fact that you could get quite a few yum cha dishes. Would definitely recommend and go here again!

Probably visited at a good time - Thursday at 17:30. Only two other tables had patrons. Attentive service and well crafted dumplings all around, very juicy with firm skin. The dim sum here beat my dinner at DTF. Order a Hong Kong cold milk tea! It comes in a flask with dry ice oozing out steam

Visited this place with the family for lunch.We ordered their Signature Roast Pork & Roast Duck. The pork was good but they have served us with the boney part of the roast duck with not much meat or crispy skin on it.The Spinach soup with 3 kinds of eggs was only so so. I have tasted much better than this in other crystal jade branches.The Watercress pork rib clear soup wasn't bad.The Deep fried pork rib with pepper was good.The Red Bean Pancake was fantastic.The waitress were not friendly or welcoming and service really below average.

Bugis junction - stir fry was good, pork dumplings average and no steamed rice in the menu. Service was poor, poor English. What topped it off was being charged for disposable napkins (even if they weren't used) & 2:50 for pickled vegetables which were placed on the table which I didn't order

It's such a pity on this establishment owner. This place always provides an excellent meal for me for past several years. The food was was yummy. Every dishes full of flavor and nice aroma. The meats always well maintained here. The down side is staffs ; hard to flag them over for anything. They looks like they were in a bad mood at all times. If service could improve. I definitely will be here more often.. Right now I popped over once in awhile when I really craving for their yummy dishes.

We ate at the Great World City Restaurant. It was a Friday lunch time crowd. The staff seemed so stressed. No one paid attention to us when we were ready to order. We had to bring the order chit to the service desk. We witnessed another customer desperately trying to get the attention of the staff to place their order. They walked out of the restaurant when it seemed no one was interested in their business.It is a real disappointment for this to happen to a Crystal Jade Restaurant. Judging from the body language of the staff, they seemed overworked and there was no service with a smile

I and hubby ate here many times in past few years. The consistency of food is good. The services always bad. This place we just go for foods such as Xiao Long Bao quality is equal to Din Dai Fong but never have to Q up. The noodle and fried veggie or boiled chicken were also as good. We will keep continue returning to this place.

This is in the food court at Bugis Junction mall which is full of great restaurants, but this one was let down by the service. We sat down and then immediately were commanded by our waitress to order our lunch. She was fairly curt and made the process extremely confusing and irritating. She kept on trying to flog more food on us, which is ironic to say she didn't manage to bring us all the food we ordered. However...The food was pretty good and authentic. We had vegetables (order broccoli and garlic!) and rice, which was quite pricey for what it was. The place was packed with locals which is always a good sign. It's just a shame that good food is being tarnished by atrocious service. If you want a peaceful meal, this is not the place for you
