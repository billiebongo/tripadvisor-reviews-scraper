Great food at low price, ate a bowl of pho and had a coupon for 1-1. so paid 10.90 for 2 bowls of generous pho. really worth it!

Had early lunch on a Saturday. Very difficult to catch the server attention even when there were not many customers yet.
Ordered few simple dishes to try. The rice vermicelli with mushrooms and tofu was quite nice. Felt ight and fresh after the meal.

delicious food! my friend and I were so glad to hae eaten here, October 2017,, we travelled to Malaysia, Phuket, Bangkok n lastly Singapore, having to eat such yummy food during our last stop was 'bloddy osum' we stayed in hotels n resort but we loved this little place so thank you for making our last days in asia osum:

Ate here for lunch with our 3 kids. We ordered 5 drinks, 2 banh mi, 1 rolls, 1 vermicelli and 1 rice and chicken dish. Service was very haphazard. All the food and drinks arrived at different times and our daughter got her meal after all of us were almost finished eating. Same thing with the drinks. Food was ok. Nothing special but average. Total cost was $80 which after 2 weeks in Bali, seemed exorbitant for such a simple meal.

The place has good vegetarian options and a really nice mushroom pot. Unfortunately, the service and quality of ingredients has been progressively declining. From a place I craved for to a place I feel bad for. The utensils and tables have stains, food portions becoming smaller and waiting queue is haphazard

Since travelling to Hanoi regularly for work a few years ago, I’ve been yearning to eat Cha Ca La Vong in Singapore. I’m sure there are separate reviews in TripAdvisor about this 100-year-old, one-dish restaurant with an almost vertical and narrow staircase in Hanoi. I managed to find the dish in Singapore at Wrap and Roll’s (W&R) branch in basement three of Ion Orchard. Thanks to the very nice Vietnamese couple at the Pho store at Great World City’s food court, who helped me end my search of Cha Ca in Singapore.Cha Ca La Vong is essentially a traditional North Vietnamese dish of grilled thick slices of fish fillet served in a hot wok of oil, turmeric and dill. It is eaten with beehoon and other vegetables or in W&R’s case, as a lettuce wrap. The W&R version is of course not as authentic as the original Cha Ca La Vong Restaurant in Hanoi but it rather good for a chain restaurant here in Singapore.The end of my craving aside, W&R more than made up for it with their Banh Xeo. This is a crispy pancake with sprinkled fillings of pork, prawns, mung beans and bean sprouts. I’m not a Vietnamese cuisine expert to say if this is authentic but W&R’s pancake is so thin and crispy, and together with their generous ingredients, it is very delicious. It is also served and can be eaten with herbs and vegetables as a wrap.My friend and I also ordered a platter of their various rolls: fresh and fried spring rolls, beef, and mushroom and pork wrapped with soft rice crepes and lastly, mustard leaf roll.Of course, W&R serve the usual Pho (rice noodles) and Banh Mi (meat in a baguette), and other grilled meats, soups and salads but our stomachs and cravings were satisfied.Although W&R is a chain restaurant originated from Vietnam with no fancy décor and ambience, the food variety and quality are on par with a dedicated restaurant. Service is also very friendly and efficient. I was warned that the Banh Xeo may require a wait but ours came timely as we finished a couple of helpings of the Cha Ca.I’ve been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant in Singapore serving beyond Pho and Banh Mi and I’ve found it

Dined here with our family. Let me start off by saying I've eaten at wrap and roll in HCM city and I was surprised that the SG outlet was a proper restaurant. The time we visited, there were only 3 wait staff- a Chinese guy, a girl, and guy#2 (not sure If he is Malay?)Chinese guy promptly seated us and was pleasant. We didn't have a lot of interaction with the girl. But, guy #2 gave us the worst service we've had in a long time. We had to be seated in 2 different tables since there were "no tables" that van accommodate our large group. Funny thing was, there were tables on the right inner side of the restaurant but Chinese guy said he can't give it to us. I just assumed it was reserved. But, We came, ate, paid, left and the tables mentioned were still unoccupied. Here's where the trouble started. I sat the kids and the nannies in one table while the rest of the adults sat at the other table. Naturally, i was planning to order for the kids table. When I started ordering for the kids table, guy#2 flat out told me "I can't take your order". When I asked why he couldn't, he just said "you have yo order with the other waiter (Chinese guy) and it has to be someone sitting at that table to order. This has to be the most stupid response and reasoning I've ever gotten from a wait staff. I even tried to explain to him that we are paying for the bill under one tab but he still refused to take the order for the kids table. So I proceeded to go to the kids table and repeat the same order to him (guy#2). At this point I felt utterly ridiculous having to repeat the same thing to the same person but standing at a different table. Chinese guy was super apologetic and when we ended the meal, He offered to waive the service charge off our bill. Food itself was below average. Some of our orders came late and had to be followed up several times before it arrived. Never eating here again. Avoid at all cost

Came here for lunch cos a friend loves vietamese french baquette. We ate in ho chi min city and since then, she craves for that. I had the fried spring roll and fried noodles. I like food fresh if it is raw food like seafood or vegetables. So i only ate sushi and seoul roll cos they r usually fresh. Vietnames seafood roll i am cautious...dont know why so i prefer the fried spring rolls. Taste good. They ran out of bread that day so we only order noodles, spring roll and a wrapped meat item...taste ok. I did not fall off the chair. Infact the vietnamese food in vietnam tasted better for some reasons. We ordered the infamous vietnamese coffee. I always love vietnamese coffee. As we had tried the different vietnamese restaurants here in Singapore, i think this is just ok for me. Service can improve too. They must be able to recommend dishes or come by to see if we need anything else. It seems like a fast food chain service wise. Room for improvement still

This has got to be a joke. Wrap & Roll needs to consider looking into some form of quality control or just change the menu to have it be a more accurate representation of their "Vietnamese Claypot Lotus Rice".A picture paints a thousand words; I don't think I need to say anything more. The waiter whom I asked about this simply said "I think the picture got problem ah"- his nonchalance was actually mildly funny. To attempt to mitigate my miserable situation, he asked, "do you want some lettuce? How about some beansprouts?" to which I gladly accepted the beansprouts. Even then, honestly, this is not acceptable. If not for the 1-for-1 entertainer app, I'd be actually pissed.I don't think the Vietnamese would be pleased

Total bill came up to $40+ for 2 banh mi, 1 grilled pork, 2 drop coffee. A little pricey as the portion size is quite tiny. Banh mi was filled with many pickled vegetables but the amount of meat was very little. Wished that they were more generous with the protein but the lemongrass chicken tasted good. Grilled pork skewer was more on the sweet side, and cut of meat was too fatty for me. The rice paper roll tore easily making it a tough challenge to wrap up the ingredients. Vietnamese coffee was still weak (even with the drip) as compared to the ones in Vietnam. The good thing about it was the milk given wasn't too sweet. Overall, a nice place to dine in. Good expensive Vietnam food but not the best

average Vietnamese restaurant in orchard rd, small menu, food was average, slow service as well. think nam nam noodle bar is is a slightly better option.
3
Ok place, ok food, ok service ....
Their rolls are fresh and the prices are very affordable.
Can try if you are around.

Went to Star Vista branch instead of this venue. Had mushroom and tofu hotpot. Nice good, with a few vegetarian options as well. Portion is just nice for one person. Services is ok, not really great, but nothing offensive as well.
3
I ordered the beef rice roll and lemongrass chicken banh mi. Portion was quite small. Not a lot of meat and fresh veggies in my opinion. They also charge 50cents for water.
4
Lots of good food choices here. From a food perspective, it's 5. From a service perspective its 5. The restaurant is very clean, the food is great, the juice is fresh. The only thing lacking is ambiance,

We stumbled across Wrap & Roll in Ion on Orchard and will be coming back for more. The food was really flavoursome and delicious. The aunties (waitresses) were very efficient and friendly. Prices are midrange but worth it.

Ion Orchard has a good range of places to sit down for a good and inexpensive lunch while shopping. Wrap and Roll is one of them, and recommended. It is an example of a growing trend in South East Asia to develop a chain that combines authentic regional food with modern restaurant standards - think Pho 24, and Papa Rich. Our plate of assorted hot and cold rolls was fresh and tasty, as was the banh mi, and I would return here for lunch on any Orchard road shopping trip

Having visited Hanoi last year, I was pleasantly surprised to find the authentic way of serving their bbq pork rolls.It is a do it yourself wrap and roll (hence the name I guess) platter complete with rice noodles and mint leaves. A spray bottle is provided to moisten the rice paper wrap.Iced coffee tasted good and service was ok.Decor and ambience is lacking, being more like a fast food outlet

There are times when I am running errands and need a quick meal . Question is where to go ? Although the choices of eating places in Singapore are many and varied , I am somewhat tired of the standard local choices in our Food Courts. I must also add, I no longer follow-up on the food critiques in our local Newspapers as most of what I have tried, have turned out to be disappointing and not up to the standard of their rave reviewers. So best is to do my own scouting. I was most pleased with my first lunch experience at Vietnamese Restaurant WRAP & ROLL, #B3-19 ION ORCHARD They offered just what I wanted....a quick fix in a clean , bright, modern environment. This is what I ordered :* 1 small portion ( 2 rolls ) of fresh mustard lettuce prawn/pork roll ( mustard green pickled is chinese chiam chye ) SGD 4.50 * 1 Pho Chicken Noodle soup SGD 11.90 * 1 water ( not f.o.c ) .50 Total + 10% SVC + 7 GST = 19.90 MY LIKES...... I loved the Wrapps . They were so light and refreshing in taste. The stock of my chicken noodle was clear of oil and was very tasty. The sauces and condiments that accompanied my order complimented the 2 dishes well.  Best of all it was an enjoyable, full of goodness, reasonably priced quick meal leaving me with a satisfied, happy feeling :-DP.S For sure I shall be returning to try their various wrapps and Mon Choy Vegetarian selection

I just went to their branch in Saigon Center in Ho Chi Ming City so wanted to compare.(There are so many other good choices so unless you are in a hurry and want to eat in perfectly air conditioned environment, I'd say try somewhere else in Vietnam. But food and price was OK as well)HCM branch was a little better with nicely fried spring rolls and fresh green leaves but I think this is just an extension of fast food restaurant so I think overall OK.

First try today at the Ion outlet.
Ordered the grilled chicken with garlic rice, wrap with leaves and pork + shrimp, and a lotus root with shrimp salad.
They all tasted great! Will return soon.

The Vietnamese food here is amazing ... noodles, wrap and baguette are just perfect proportion and yummy... the Vietnamese coffee is to die for ..and is a must..
Service is good and fast.

Wife and I were in Singapore for holiday and while shopping in Ion we stopped in here for dinner.
If one likes Vietnamese food this is the place. Highly suggested.

Variety of rolls with plenty of vegetables. Healthy choice and good taste. Grilled pork is also best choice in this restaurant. Service is good and fast.

@TheKuoKnowsWrap & Roll has brought something a little special to the Vietnamese food scene in Singapore. It has made good quality Vietnamese cuisine available at a reasonable price in convenient locations.The name of the restaurant might sound a little misleading, though. It doesn't do tacos and burritos. The eatery also looks a tad low key. But that belies the quite superb Vietnamese fare on offer inside.The Vermicelli with Spring Rolls is insanely delicious. What can be better than a combination of tightly-wrapped, crisply-fried spring rolls and fresh herbs on a bed of soft noodles. Heaven!The Hanoi Tumeric Fish with Dill is not just pleasing to the eye. It's a chance to evidence how Vietnamese food manage to combine flavour, texture, colour and herbs in an unassuming but highly-effective way.Wrap and Roll has set the standard for first-rate but affordable Vietnamese food in Singapore. Well done

Went this afternoon. Had a dish called rice with SHAKING beef. Waiter from Taiwan couldn't explain what shaking meant. But he said the beef was in cubes or small pieces. Yea it was. It was a kind of beef stew. Not quite Vietnamese in flavor. In fact not much flavor at all. The other dish we had faired much better. I can't remember the name, but it's code on menu was M1. It was dry white noodles with grilled pork and porky spring rolls. Comes with fish sauce which you add to your taste. Had some feeling of Vietnamese cuisine. Had to ask for paper napkins. There were none on the table. It's not that the service staff was unfriendly; forgetful maybe?It was an ok experience

I'm a big fan of Vietnamese having spent some time working there. And Wrap&Roll do an excellent job of grabbing some fresh ingredients and replicating the tastes of Vietnam. Took a little while to be served, but the food came out hot and tasting fresh. Do yourself a favour and try their "self-wrapping" menu items. And the spring roll platter appetiser was also well worth the experience. They also have a very health and calorie conscious approach for those of us who care about that.

Visited Ion orchard outlet at 11am; non peak hour. Went to try the eatigo promotion 50% discount. Wanted to order the famous baguette with pork but was informed that they don't have certain sauce and was advised that it won't taste nice. We ordered the beef soup noodle, wrap platter and prawn pancake. Beef soup noodle is a comfort food, quite easy on the stomach. Soup is not salty not much MSG too.Wrap platter contains some fried items which are quite oily. You need to dip into the vinegar sauce to remove the oiliness taste. Prawn pancake is nice but too oily. Though they serve ice water, we still ordered an energy booster drink. We wanted to order the rice roll with mince pork but they left out our order. We tried ordering it a 2nd time but they still did not proceed with the order. Total bill after 50% discount is $27.70.

we don't eat meat but do eat fish and seafood. Explained that to the waiter and ordered fresh spring rolls without pork, with just prawns, and also grilled fresh sugar cane prawn. The spring rolls were brought with meat and we found out that the sugar cane prawn dish also contains pork, although it isn't stated anywhere on the menu. I must say the chap that served us was super unhelpful and sloppy. There was another lady waiter who was switched on apologized and we didn't pay for the food. Thank goodness we dont suffer any allergies, but from now on I do not trust this place with the accuracy of their menu or attentiveness of the staff. Extremely disappointing experience. Watch out

Visited on 23thMay16' with my mother around 12pm+, restaurant was already half full. Ordered Chicken Garlic Rice $11.90 as I'm using The Entertainer app so is one for one,find the chicken well grilled,my mother finished it faster than me. And me,find it very full after finished. Ordered Mushroom Toufu roll $4.90 for 2. Actually,wanted to order the Pomelo juice but run out so ordered Fresh coconut juice $4.90,lots of juice.Overall, spend $31.30 for 2 person is very worth as The Entertainer App is a great deal,which helped me save $$. Service is average

Very good chicken Pho and prawn toast for lunch. Just Love the authentic Vietnamese food in this little gem of a reastaurant.
4
Overall, their dishes are authentic. We liked the lemon grass pork particularly, as it's well marinated and tender. Part of the fun is to make the fresh rolls ourselves. This is our fifth visit, don't expect much of the service during peak hours.

Food was good. Service was great and price was reasonable.
Highly recommended and worth another visit again

My friend and I went here for dinner. We visited the branch at ION Orchard B3 outlet. When we first come in, we are greeted by a female staff with a smile, however i was picking up my phone and she came to us because my friend wanted to order. So, I was talking on the phone and yet I am ordering but she was tapping her feet and showing that we took to long to order but it was only about one or two minutes. This is not a thing that i want to complain. THIS is just a slight irritating feeling from a service staff to a customer that i can still understand.HOWEVER, my friend ask for a glass of ice water because i eaten a spicy thing and then the same female staff come and said okay. But then, she didnt come back to us for about 10 minutes yet and was serving other customers.I notice that there are a few customers waiting for their food and waiting for the seats.BUT,THIS IS NOT A BUSY PERIOD YET THE WATER IS JUST A FEW WALKS AWAY FROM MY TABLE. I didnt bother to ask the same staff and I asked another staff, a male staff but yet he didnt come back to us for about 5 minutes and asked for the second time and after that the staff giving it to me. BUT, during the time he was going back and forth and didnt even give me the water yet my seats are nearby the cashier.This is not the type of service that I would expect from a restaurant, and I understand that some people may have some trouble remembering the order. I asked a few of my friend and they also said that it was a bad service experience for them. This means that this didnt happen to myself only but to a few other people. I hope that the restaurant can improve their service otherwise people will not come anymore because of the service. Overall, the food are pretty good, i enjoyed the food but wouldnt come twice for the servic

Went here for lunch and asked the waiter if there was MSG in the Pho soup. He said no I informed him that if I eat too much I get migraines and vomiting. He again said no MSG. The food was actually nice but half way through I got the sensation there was MSG so I didn't drink any more of the soup. I asked at the till and the server there told me there was MSG in the soup. I now have a cracking headache but no vomiting yet. Luckily I didn't finish off the rest of the soup.

Visited on 14thMar16' w friend at this ION Orchard B3 outlet. Reached around 12pm n inside tables almost 50% occupied so we r seated near the entrance. As I am using The Entertainer app so I can only choose those self wrap n roll,main course.We ordered Vietnam Mushroom Hotpot $13.90-soup base's have a very strong lemongrass taste(not our liking) with emoji mushroom,1 big mushroom,white mushroom,others mushroom,Sio Pei Chye,round tou fu,dry beancurd. It does not include rice nor vermicelli. Pork Skewers-$9.90 for 1 to 1 deal(yummy!!! It comes with 6-7pieces of rice paper,bundle of rice vermicelli tie with leaf,mustard leave n mint leave n a bottle with water for us to spray water onto the rice paper before we put any food on it)Fresh Spring Toll Prawn & Pork $5.90 for 2 rolls with sauce(find it too bland if never dip with sauce). Fresh Spring Roll Mushroom $4.90 for 2 rolls. It's much more tastier than prawn n pork roll as mushroom is very tasty might be mushroom stir fry with toufu.Pomelo juice $5.90,pomelo taste very strong n we like it very much.Total spend, $ 42.95 with 10% SVC CHG n 7% GST. Overall, service wise is average as for food, will go back to try others for example their Pho

I walked in not expecting too much. I know they have a few wrap and roll outlets in the city and the decor of the chain just looks very fast foodish. The same must apply to the food, I thought. We ordered an assortment of rolls and they did come pretty fast, but they were also very good! The rice paper crepe used was a bit too sticky but the different fillings were all delicious: pork & prawn, toufu & mushroom, minced pork and beef. There was a crispy carrot cake which was also very good. Service, to my surprise, was also exemplary- polite, smiling and knowledgable. Food was also inexpensive. Recommended.

Epicure reviewers or Wrap and Roll management should go back and test ? Here are the facts : I paid 23 Sing for a bowl of Pho ( description below) a diet coke and 2 rolls of bbq chicken.The Pho came with tons if rice noodles, insipid soup ( please check) , five slices of boiled beef ( half of slice was white fat) with a side of ten / twelve bean sprouts, five mint leaves, 1/8 of a lime, and 1 / 8th of a red chilli. Total cost at home probably 2-3 bucks ?Indifferent service - did not see a single Vietnamese person not that I care ..what I cared what the quality which could maybe supervised by someone close to that Food culture ?

Had lunch today with my bride who is Vietnamese.I has the Pho Ga which was ok by Singapore standards. The price was 11.95, again for Singapore was overpriced. My wife has the grilled pork with rice wraps. You have to spray water on the wraps to soften them. My bride indicated that they were old as they just cracked apart. The service was ok. Not sure if we would return again

In trying to navigate the maze of the amazing ION shopping center we chanced upon this gem. Fresh Vietnamese with a great variety of food and drinks. Fresh beef steamboat...cook your own handled well by the teenager...fresh rice paper rolls for the gluten free teenager...lots of meat for the carnivore. A great franchise with great food and well priced. Thanks Kim Oanh
