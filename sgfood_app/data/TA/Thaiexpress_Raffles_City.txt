At the basement of Raffles City. Ordered using Ipad. Fishcake arrived soon and also two of the main courses. However number 3 took very long time. Taste was OK but nothing special.

Food was horrible. I ordered pad Thai but the noodles was dry. For the price I paid ($12.70) seriously don't worth a penny! Pineapple fried rice tastes bland too. Really disappointing.

Had the fish cakes which may or may not have had fish in them.
Tom yum was way too sour.
Basil Chicken rice was chicken and way too much chilli.
A plus was it was quick and not too expensive.

At Raffles City Shopping basement, good Thai food and interesting order taking mechanism (done on a smart device, slip printed out on a mobile printer that the waiter carries with him). Took some time for food to be served, but was worthwhile.

We were hungry and wanted a quick lunch, so went to this restaurant. The food was surprisingly delicious and fresh and very tasty. Definitely recommend this for a quick and tasty bite.

The food is very salty. Comes in very small portion. The worst is when our first dish is served, no utensils at all!

We very much enjoyed our dinner at ThaiExpress Singapore. Both the food and service were excellent. I love spicy Thai food, and this certainly met my expectations for taste and quality. All four of us loved it and highly recommend it.

On Sept. 10th we had a meal at this restaurant. The meal I ordered was very very hot, noticed by the wait staff who came and asked if I was okay. When hearing of the problem a young lady suggested another dish which would not be too hot, and it wasn't. There was no charge for my original order and I had eaten perhaps a quarter of it. We were really impressed by this, and by the attention of the wait staff in noticing my predicament. Well done guys

We enjoyed the delicious pat thai but there were many out of control children there making a lot of noise! There was one waiter who was in my opinion hopeless and rude, also lacking basic manner! He wore large glasses and when I asked him to take our order he kept walking and wiped down some tables...then he still ignored us, took of his apron and walked out of the restaurant, not even mentioning to another staff member we wanted to order! He also leaned right in front of my wife to pass cuttlery to the next table, not even an "excuse me!" Rude

Had an evening meal at this place, that is located within Raffles City on the recommendation of the concierge. Great recommendation as the food was great and enjoyed by everyone. I had Tom yum to start and pad Thai (really tasty), friends had chicken wings and tofu to start and main courses which they raved about. Loses a start as limited selection of bottled beers, very limited atmosphere (located in the basement of this sprawling shopping centre) and the service was just Ok. Starters and mains all arrived together. Great tasting food
