The dish that i always order when I am here is the Sambal Chilli Fish. The fish is fried so crispy that you can eat the bones, although it is a chilli fish, it is not spicy.

When we reached there, they claimed that their online system not working so claimed we do not have a reservation. Managed to give us a table but expect us to finish the dinner in less than 1.5hours.

Conveniently located along the main road, just opposite the car park, this popular restaurant was full house but table was available fast (luckily). Dishes are delicious, not too oily or too salty. Price very reasonable too! Very satisfied with my first visit and will be back

Our family of four had a delightful dinner here. Conveniently reserved through Chope, our table was ready for us at 7.30pm on a Saturday night with the restaurant quite full with large family groups. Though we were disappointed that the haecho(prawn rolls) were not available, we were more than satisfied with the fish head curry replete with long beans, lady's fingers, brinjal and taupok in a coconut curry. The fish meat was fresh and tasty with the necessary gooey texture of skin and eyeball that we love. The fried kangkong had just the right amount of sambal blachan for the kick without being too salty and went perfectly with the good quality white rice. The sea cucumber came with beautifully fried tofu, crisp on the outside and soft inside while the fish maw soup was fragrant with a dash of Chinese wine. Service was quick, pleasant and efficient. This is a reliable establishment worth coming back to time and time again, and not just for the famed sambal fish

service of one of the Chinese speaking lady staff was really good. She saw us saying that the tea was hot and immediately brought over a few glass of ice without us telling her to do so. The food has improved from the last time we ate. Thank you to the Chef cooking which made our farewell dinner of one of our staff a memorable one.

Presently run by 3rd generation of the owner, their sambal is less oily & they use deep fried black pomfret for their signature dish. It is located at the corner of Jalan Tua Kong & Upper East Coast road corner near Siglap. We went during lunch time to celebrate promotion party of a colleague.There is a public car park on the opposite side & bus stop on both sides of the main road outside. It is placed equidistant from Kembangan & Bedok MRT stations but not at a walking distance. Nearby there is a Shell petrol pump & 7 Eleven on the other side of the road & several other eating joints nearby.The place has indoor as well outdoor seating area & serves various seafood & other Chinese delicacies like golden snapper, crab, squid, sea cucumber, red grouper, cray fish, prawns, curry fish head, chicken, pork, bean curd, soup, omelets, horfun, vegetables, rice, noodles etc. Though several items look exotic & the presentation is colorful they are not spicy.Though they serve beer, few other beverages & desserts stick with warm Chinese tea for the drink & hot yam paste with Gingko nuts as a dessert. It is more in-house preparation like their food servings

Fist time patronize this restaurant as colleague buy us lunch. The restaurant has about four tables for 10pax and 2 tables for 2pax with air-con, and about 10 tables for 3pax outside. There is not many customers during the lunch period as there are only 2 tables occupied by us for 16pax and another table for 2pax.Orderd local dishes-veg, tofu, deep fried prawn,fried pork, mix veg, chilli fish, fried eye, and fried chicken with thai salad. Follow up with dessert- jelly with longan or yam paste.Food wise is average

This place is not a cheap eat location, but the Sambal fish is worth the while.We ordered a set meal which is good for 4-5 pax at 138++. It comes with the famous Sambal fish (a good size one), Fish Maw soup, Prawn m Scallops , Sweet sour pork and a dessert. This set is value for money.The set exudes rice which is a must to eat the fish.This will makes about 32SGD per pax.Parking is not a issue, there is a public carpark just opposite .Dont mind coming again

My family's favorite restaurant. We love their Sambal fish, curry fish head, seafood horfun, hot plate toufu... Kids love their crabmeat toufu, veggie, sweet and sour pork.You may hop over to the next door cafes or pubs, or ice cream for your after meal drinks or hangout, or even have your grocery at fair price or cold storage, as the location is quite convenient.
