Food and service was excellent. Would have made the night even more special if they had the initiative to do something nice for the birthday girl. Of course it is not required, but would have been nice.

The ambiance of the restaurant was good in the evening, a little too loud for people to speak to each other. Food was great, good renditions of local, oriental food served in a classy manner.

Went with a Friend for office lunch and found the singaporean food to be quite decent, and that too on a good Budget (6-8 bucks per dish). One of the many eating options in the CBD area, but well worth a try.

ambience was good, yong tau fu is quite a comfort food at night, service was good. a good place to chill out on a saturday night as it wasn't that packed.

Visited for lunch on a weekday, the place was filled pretty quickly as it was during the lunch hour. We had to first queue to choose the ingredients we wanted, before paying at the cashier. They will provide a buzzer that alerts you when your food is ready for collection. The dry version of their Yong Tau Foo was great, I also enjoyed it with their signature noodles (thick bee hoon)

My friend who was the birthday girl had selected this restaurant. There were plenty of parallel parking around the estate. The location is easy to find, facing the temple along Telok Ayer Street across the road. Although there was only 1 serving staff and 1 bartender, the capacity was manageable. The interior design was a mix of Oriental and Western fusion. The food presentation was good and of course delicious. We ordered everything that the waitress had recommended since it was our first visit. We were also welcomed by the happy hours drinks till 8pm which we could order 2 rounds and put them on hold to enjoy the promotion. We were the last customers to leave at around 11pm on a Tuesday, we enjoyed ourselves. Anyway I booked through Chope only the day itself and got the email confirmation within an hour. I'm glad that we secured the reservation. This place is worth another visit

Had a couple of beers here today on our way back from Chinatown whilst sheltering from the rain. Friendly service, but the Asahi beer during Happy Hour was advertised at $9 for a Full Pint. Now I know what a pint looks like, and these glasses were no more than 2/3 of a pint at the most. Same was true of the other beer drinkers on the next table, whether Asahi or Kronenbourg, the measures were short of those advertised. Anyway rant over, it was good beer and served cold
