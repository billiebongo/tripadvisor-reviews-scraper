Not quite sure why but unlike their restaurant counterparts, Korean fried chicken served at fast food outlets here is almost always dry. Tasty and flavorful yes, but dry.

Our 2nd visit to savour the halal Korean food. The soy wings are our favourites. We also enjoyed the noodles and Korean sushi (forgot the Korean name though). We shared the very popular Oreo Bingsu. The portion is good for 3 person. Will make a come back soon.

A must try! Alot of variety of korean food. Ranging from jjajangmyeon to kimbap and to chicken wings. Fusion food such as kimchi fries, burgers and such. Tried their jjajangmyeon and jjampong set and it was really good. Jjajjangmyeon is good for those who prefers non-spicy noodles however those who are not used to the flavour of black bean, it is recommended to try it first by having the half jjampong and half jjajang set. Chicken wings are good and well covered in sauce.Love the tteobokki but it is not the best i've tried. But worth the try! The tteok has a little bit of a hard n crunchy texture, served with sauce that is quite spicy. really good!Location is good at is located near bustops and just opp the bugis MRT station. The wait for food is not long, probably takes around 3 mins for the food to be ready. Overall food is priced well (not crazy overpriced like some other korean food shops in sg). Great ambience but can get really crowded in the weekends. Will definitely come back again!Would be really good if they can deliver islandwide

Had my first meal there when I reached Singapore. I searched online for some good restaurants nearby Bugis and found this place. We ordered bibimbap, jjamppong and drumsticks bap. The food are not overly priced, and tasted well beyond expectation.For people who couldn't make up their mind to choose between jjajangmyeon or jjamppong, this place offer jjamjjamyeon which is a combination of both

First time i tried jinjja and chose their monster chicken. It's sooooooooooo spicy! But somehow it's addictive. The wings more tasty than the drumstick. They serves jajjangmyeon too and they have K fries as well (which is fries with melted cheese on top). Worth to try

The prices are all quite reasonable, especially the bingsu. My family and I like it so much, Patbingsu is recommended to you all to try. The taste is unique. They serve Oreo bingsu as well as strawberry cheesecake bingsu. The portions of all the food are quite big. For the main dishes, it'd be more enjoyable if the binbimbap served hot. It was a bit cold. However, the monster sauce is suggested to spicy food lover. It will definitely be an awesome experience.Overall, worth to try.

Visited the restaurant as recommend by friends. Tried the signature Jinjja Wings (love the monster flavor), seafood jjamppong, Patbingsu, Silkhye rice drink, Yuzu drink etc... They have introduce new flavour - monster jinjja wings which I like it the most!! Tried the monster seafood jjamppong and it it REALLY HOT!!!! Remb to order more drink if u wan to challenge it! Hehe I personally like the Silkhye rice drink. It is a very traditional rice drink similar to our homecook barley but taste richer than barley..... Give it a try if u have no idea what to order. Well done flying chicken!!
