The Lunch Bowls are good and reasonable for lunches. You place the order at the counter and bring the food to the table. Can be pressurizing if you cannot decide with a long queue forming behind you. Noticed many patrons ordering take-away.

very good food and great service :) a good place for a fun and chill night out to grab some drinks !
4
The food was pretty good, especially the dinner bowls. However, the omakase platter is a little insufficient to fill our tummy. The space is a little constrained as well. Hard to move around and hard to talk cos it's too noisy.
3
Imaginative food, very tasty. Gets very busy so you may have to wait even if you have a reservation.
4
The tapas were good. I especially love the broccoli. I know it sounds crazy but it was absolutely yummy :)
5
A great find on Telok Ayer street with delicious yakitori, rice bowls and a fantastic happy hour! The salmon bowl was delicious!
4
Ordered a dinner bowl and broccoli appetitser. The dinner bowl is nicely prepared and tastes great. The brocoli was kinda greasy and I didn't fancy it. Cocktail wasn't very appealing too! Probably of my selection!
4
Healthy and tasty food. The jelly pork is a must to try. Quaint and chic place. good for a group hangout or for a couple date night.
3
Prices for the food were slightly above average and overall passable but no real wow factor. The newly launched makis were a disappointment as the rice used in the maki wasn’t sushi rice and it made the whole dish dry and grainy. The bowls used the same rice as well so we didn’t enjoy it as much. Highly recommend the uni soba and yakiniku don though!! Service was quite fast so props to the staff! The atmosphere on a saturday afternoon was quiet which was nice however the place seemed a bit tight and squeezy. Overall not too bad a place but would definitely come back to try their weekday lunch protein bowls!
3
I went there for Lunch during weekend. They only provided dinner bowl and I had chirashi. It was delicious but I felt the price was a bit high as the ingredients were not so various. But I heard weekday lunch is quite different. And for dinner time, they provide more various dishes which seems it will go along well with their Martini Cocktails. Maybe I should try dinner sometime.
5
Usual place that I would usually bring my friends, due to the generosity in their serving portions, as well as the happy hour drink deals that are value money. got to try their $5 tapas and selected drinks during my recent visit, did not disappoint
5
Food and service was really good, ordered the ribeye don! However the food is abit pricey. Overall it was a good experience.
5
We went for one of the combo deals where you get a bowl, some sides and the yakitori washed down with delicious lychee martini and espresso martinis! The broccoli was so tasty and the beef and foi gras bowl a standout!
3
Came here with a friend for dinner and ordered the aburi broccoli & aburi salmon (with scrambled egg) bowl. The broccoli was absolutely delicious but the salmon bowl was nothing to brag about. The toriyaki was too charred but sauce was quite flavourful.
3
Toriyaki was so-so but they do have nice rice bowls~ The broccoli was awesome though~ tasted like JB fried lok lok~ But really too expensive!! =)
4
We had the beef foie gras and unagi foie gras rice bowls. These were tasty but the beef was a bit tough. We also had the Manila Clams which was a generous serving. The clams were dry unlike the typical white wine sauce version. TThe condiments made it nice and tasty. We also had the egg plant which was very good. Overall, pretty good food.
2
Well, it's a very very small place. Came on a Wednesday night and it was packed. Lucky we made reservations otherwise wouldn't have gotten a seat for quite some time. Ambience outside was nice, but the dining area was so cramp and tables was so small. Halfway through our meal they started blasting the music, not sure if to chase us away or irritate us, and everyone started talking very loudly. Food wise I was greatly disappointed, not sure how this place got voted in Chope. Ordered the chirashi bowl, portions were small, seafood mediocre, and felt overly priced. Also ordered two yakitori, one pork fowl and the one with leek, both badly done. Too much sauce or too much salt. Both overcooked and tough like leather. Even tori Q wins hands down. Only thing nice was the beef with foie gras, loved the foie gras and it was done beautifully. Rice however was over soaked with sauce.. Won't be recommending this place to my friends or family
3
On the outside MOJO is packed with hip happy hour goers, mostly expats in jovial weekend mood. It's much quieter inside with a few tables for a quiet dinner. Our group had their signature dinner bowls which were really lovely, meats were tender and comment from my friend was that it was value for money for the foie gras on his don. For drinks, we enjoyed some asahi white and black on a 1-for-1 deal.
3
The unagi uni bowl i had was superb! The martiinis was not bad except I could barely taste the alcohol. Beef yakitori was good but chicken yakitori was too tough, which was a shame cos it's chicken right? I'd thought its a easy meat to handle for any restaurant chef.Would go back but this time, I'd stick to the rice bowls
2
I came in for drinks and ordered draft beers. However, the drinks took 30 minutes to reach my table. I had to check with the waitress several times to ascertain my order was placed. While waiting for the beer, I wanted to order some food and decided to go for the calamari. I changed my mind after seeing that the calamari rings were frozen food.
4
had the beef and foie gras quinoa bowl and it was delicious!! 1-4-1 martinis were the cherry on top of the meal!
5
had the 1 for 1 cocktails. yuzu cocktail was delightful. tried the bowls too, enjoyed the mentaiko snapper greatly. would go again
4
It’s more of a drinking place, filled with expats & office crowds especially on a Friday evening. Parking was not easy to find. Limited place for dining. Food was good with generous toppings. Service was quick which is awesome.
4
though the aburi broccoli could be a little jelak after a while, balance it out with their happy hour deals. The quinoa was an interesting dish - never thought ill like quinoa
1
Before ordering, I have already checked with the waiter if I could use the $100 Chope voucher. He checked and said yes. Only after paying did I realise I was charged $44 instead of $22 for 2 glasses of red wine because the voucher is not applicable for Happy Hour. When I confronted Mojo, the restaurant merely apologized and implied it is my fault for not reading the terms and conditions. It would have been polite and honest if Mojo highlighted upon payment that redeeming the voucher would cause the meal to be more expensive. Instead of saving 10%, I have ended up paying more!
4
Went there with a colleague after work and the place was quite empty when we first began. We ordered the beef rice bowl and there was a bit too much fats for my liking on the beef (but again, not like I could have expected it to be 100% lean meat). The place gives off a very upbeat vibe, especially since customers are usually in and out quite quick. A good place to catch up with old friends but would not recommend for dates
3
Tried the foie gras ribeye dinner bowl and was disappointed. The beef was dry and tough, and the foie gras was not seared properly. The sauce on the rice was nice at first, sweet, but after awhile it gets to you. But if you enjoy sweet sauces, go ahead!
5
first came here for my birthday celebration was in Sept 2017. Group gathering. Dinner bowls All looked so sumptuous. dropped by the area again and automatically warrant a return visit. the sauce for grilled beef and foie gras landed at the bottom of the bowl and kinda salty at the final of the meal. All in All still good. a bowl is sufficient to make a hungry woman full.
4
The foie gras and grilled beef ribeye rice bowls and pork jowl yakitori were pretty good. However, the martini special was quite a disappointment especially when the "1 for 1" offer was only just $4 cheaper than the usual price. Also, the staff have forgotten that it was my friend's birthday even though I have mentioned it when making the reservation with Chope
3
Made a booking via chope (just 2 of us) and when we arrived, we were made to squeeze in a table in between 2 other couples. Note at this point there was clearly other tables free. It was so noisy, we hardly enjoyed our stay, hurriedly ate the food, paid and left
4
had the beef bowl, chirasi don and calamari sides. both the bowls were amazing but the calamari disappointed. also the food was abit on he priced side
2
Ingredients are not that fresh or generous. Pricey for the plain atmosphere. Service was friendly but slow as I had to ask for hot water thrice before it came. Overall, nothing spectacular and not worth a second visit :(
5
Kitchen was accommodating and changed our rice base to salad which is great. Food was a little on the salty side, which I suppose would have been great with rice
5
great ambience, delicious food. one-for-one beer for dinner. highly recommended for group gatherings =)
3
Squeezy cramped place. Took a while to get seated as they seem quite short staff. Rice bowls pretty average but martinis were decent.
2
I ordered a bowl containing omelette, ikura and salmon sashimi slices that seemed to be boiled on one side (not aburi or chargrilled) and it tastes really bad, mainly due to the salmon. The salmon was tasteless and the ikura was not fresh and very fishy. I left half the bowl untouched. Omelette was tasty and there was a generous portion for it, which was the main thing I was eating. If I do come back, I will not order this dish again. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish hence my experience here wasn't great
5
awesome ambience and food as usual, have been coming here almost once a month, value for money happy hour drink deals, and chope 2nd bowl discount. 2 pax cost us $90 for two rice bowls, a side, and 2 drinks. was issued a seat at the side of the wall and facing a wall, they need to redesign how the seats should be placed, as it gets really cramped/claustrophobic when it is full-house
3
Overall the food was alright, was expecting the flavors to be more awesome, but the pictures didn't live up to the taste. One disappointment was the atmosphere. The kitchen door was left opened, which left the restaurant rather smoky. And staff could be heard chatting away from inside the kitchen, could even hear the game they were playing on their phone. And for some reason there wasn't any music playing. Pity though, as the shophouse could'ev made for a quaint place for lunch. Beyond that, the weekend grain bowls displayed on their website was not available, rather.. the staff appeared clueless that such items were even on the menu.. strange.
1
This ought to be the worst lunch box I have ever had in town. The beef served was cold and tough. (I recall checking with the staff at the front counter before I ordered and was told that the beef was hot). At the price of $17, I would have gone to a cafe in CBD and get nice ambience, hot & quality food and better service!
3
Visited MOJO by recommendation. Food was not bad. But the experience was definitely not a pleasant one. Staff was not able to appease table next to ours that were talking so loudly. Chope had a 50% off second bowl promo going on and staff did not automatically include the discount when we called for the bill even though Iâ€™ve mentioned it to them earlier. I had to inform them again, after the bad experience with rowdy guest, to include that discount. Service recovery was just not there.
5
As per my title. Love the feel. A little noisy if for a romantic date. Food is a tad pricey for the quality. Quantity is good. Still love the place and service!
5
Perfect for the after work chill out. A great place to unwind and catch up with long time friends. Excellent customer service!
4
Great value for drinks esp with 1 for 1 going daily. foie gras beef don good, chirashi average. Part i didnt like was ambience. The place was packed and sound radiating throughout the place.
4
The staff were very friendly. We ordered the foe grais and grilled ribeye steak and it was yummy! If only the indoor seats were more comfortable as they were pretty tight and no space for our bags.
4
Probably one of the best chirashi bowls I've had. The rice was immaculately flavoured and accompanied the sashimi blocks well:) I would highly recommend their roasted broccoli tapas plates. Service wise, I appreciate that the waiters were very attentive, but I wouldbhave appreciated if they hadn't rushed us repeatedly to make up our minds about our orders.
3
In the day, Mojo mainly focuses on its grain bowls where you select your base and toppings. At night it tries to turn into a tapas bar. The restaurant doesn’t really stand out in terms of interiors. The design lacks a sense of direction and there isn’t harmony with the architecture, fittings, finishings, and furnitures, which makes the place not particularly pleasant looking. They also keep the whole place way too warm.The food - we had ordered the beef and foie gras donburi - was not bad. The beef and foie gras weren’t high quality, but the taste was still pretty solid. Could do with more rice. The drinks, are very weirdly priced. They claim to have “1-for-1” (which actually means 2-for-1 or buy one get one free) but the prices are extremely inflated. The effective price for one martini during happy hour is $12, while the regular price at any other timing is $14. I’m sorry, but you can’t call it “1-for-1” when you hack up the prices. Marketing it at $24 for 2 would sit way better with me rather than this dishonest and gimmicky tactic. It goes the same for their wines and beers too.Service was good, the servers were friendly and accommodating , albeit a little slow.Would I return to Mojo? I might, but probably not for the gimmicky happy hour drinks
3
Ordered the chirashi bowl and the beef curry rice. The beef rice was quite tasty. However, the chirashi bowl was bad. The vinegar used in the rice tasted weird and the rice was not properly cooked. There were lumps of rice in the bowl. It is way too expensive for such quality
5
Was given a seat under the cotton buds area, 2nd time here and recommended this place to my friends. my friends had the beef and foie gras bowl and they loved it. I had the aburi salmon bowl which I really loved as well. 1-for-1 drinks almost all night. Pricing of food is a little on the pricey side
3
I absolutely love their signature dinner rice bowls, their beef are tender and nicely done. Aburi salmon and tamago is very delicious too. Also love their thick slice of foie gras. The price of the rice bowl was on a steeper side, about $30 per bowl.However, I do not enjoy their ambience at night, when it gets super crowded and loud, with many people drinking and getting drunk. tables are placed very near to each other so there is no privacy at all. For a 2nd visit, I made reservation at 5pm to avoid the loud crowd and i jus wan to enjoy the food. When we arrived, we are the only 2 customers in the restaurant but they refused to let us sit in the 4 person tables, saying that it will get crowded soon. It was 5pm!! And people only start filling in at about 6.20pm. I felt very disappointed with the way they give their service. The other couples who came 1 hr later than us, got the 4 person tables, because the 2 person tables are filled. Super unfair since we purposely come early to avoid crowd and to have better seats. They should be more flexible with their seating arrangement. With the price they are Charging, we expect better service. Ended up we are squeezing in our tiny tables, because we ordered quite a lot of food, while the other tables are empty for the 1.5 hrs we are there. What kind of logic is that? I love the food but this service makes me hate to go back again
4
Visited Mojo with my friends on 31 Aug for dinner. We ordered the rice bowls, a few sticks of yakitori and drinks under the Happy Hour. The rice bowls were satisfying for both our taste buds and stomach. However, the yakitori we ordered tasted a tad too salty for our liking. In addition, it seemed the air conditioning was not working that night as it was rather stuffy while we were sitted at our table.
4
Everything was good! My 4th visit to MOJO. Some comments on the chicken karaage, it tastes quite salty and seems over fried. If possible, can look into it cause it won't like that when i first try it. Overall the foods are awesome! :) thanks!
3
Went with friend for dinner. Food is nice but quite pricey for the portion. Waitress are attentive and serve us with water frequently. May consider going there again.
5
Food was good, ambience was great... service excellent.
No doubt it was manged well... although we missed the martinis, we had the 1 for 1 asahi...
great meals matched with chilling beer...
Will surely return for more!
3
Second visit . Ran out of yuzu martini and waiter still took the order and served us the wrong flavour and only informing us after we clarified again. Rice bowls servings look smaller
5
Love the food and drinks on happy hour! Size of rice bowls could do better but maybe cos I am a bigger eater than most puny girls?
3
Not many choices in the menu. Food portion is small and might not be filling up for bigger eaters...
5
The food was Delicious!, and happy hour is great value! I will visit again and recommend to everyone
4
Ordered the roasted unagi & uni ($29++) and grilled rib eye & foie gras ($25++) rice bowls and two pints of draught asahi ($15++ for two). Food was 7/10 overall in terms of taste and value. Unagi lacked the slack umph to up it to the next level while the uni serving was generous and tasty. Beef was quite succulent but also lacking a bit of flavour and the serving of foie gras like the uni was generous and grilled to almost perfection. Service was prompt and on point, staff was always ready to serve. However the seating is a tad squeezy due to the small space available so do make your reservations!
1
Food portion were not worth the amount spent especially for the aburi salmon. Mostly were just scrambled eggs. I don't think I would want to pay $23++ for a bowl of scrambled eggs with rice. The 1 for 1 drinks weren't fantastic worth each glass cost $22 so ultimately it wasn't worth. Would not go back again.
4
Finally got the chance to try MOJO after reading so many good reviews about it! Had their Omakase Platter for 2 at $80++. The Aburi Broccoli was interesting! The Yakitori sticks were delicious! The salmon bowl with scrambled eggs was pretty good! Should give this place a try! :
5
Located in the middle of the Telok Ayer area, and a bit crowded but it's definitely worth the queue. Super tasty food, speedy and healthy as well. Great place for lunch!
5
Service was excellent and food was really good. The place is slightly noisy so it may not be very condusive for conversations
3
Dining environment is cosy and quiet. Had the charashi bowl and foie gras beef bowl. Foie gras beef bowl was good while the charashi bowl was mediocre as the fish quality was so so.
4
Small place but love the cheap martinis. Good for afternoon break. brocolli was good too. but wont visit durin glunch
4
The food was great, with good (big) portions. Had duck liver and it was very creamy. Definitely will go again!
5
Food was great. Had the ribeye foie gras bowl which was pretty godly. Music was a little too loud. But overall i would re visit again soon!
4
Was here for dinner with my family. Wide variety of dinner bowls available. Price range is from $23 onwards. We ordered Salmon and Chicken bowls. Delicious! Maybe just a suggestion for improvement: Try not to overcook the chicken meat as they are pretty burnt. Overall, recommended and will come back again!

Selected this restaurant based on menu details on app for "Weekend Grains Bowl" and booked for 11:30am as we had other appointments that Saturday. Arrived at 11:25 to a restaurant this not ready to serve, where they tried seating us while the floors were still wet. My wife and sis decided to take our 2 year old for a walk to allow for the restaurant to be ready. Further delays after we were seated 20mins down the road, had to get the menu ourselves, then the staff rushed over to explain yakitori dishes that were not available i.e. gizzards and such which we were fine with. Scan through, made our selection which included side appetizers for the toddler. Then I had asked the staff if there is another menu for the weekend grains bowl that they had advertised on Chope. Another staff came and explained that that menu is only available on weekdays... I clarified that the weekend grains bowl is only available on the weekdays. He further added that the appetizers, greens and sharing plates are all not available and only the dinner bowls are available during lunch. If you look at the menu, you will realize that the entire menu have been reduced to just 7 selection of bowls for lunch!!! We asked if he could speak to the chef to make something on the side / small portion for the toddler, twice and we were declined twice. After all the frustration, as we had purchased a Chope voucher for this place, we ordered 3 bowls which were not spectacular (this could be due to our moods at that point), then I tried my wife's bowl and realize it tasted the same as mine. This would be the Chirasi and the Ribeye bowls. My wife and sis did not finish their bowls as it tasted rather monotonous towards the end, this is sashimi with lots of sweet sauce, rice, sprinkles and nothing else. They were both hoping for some veg or the sides that is not available. We noticed that many couples came in, sat down and left after talking to the waiters. From the point we sat down, the AC felt like it was just switched on and the kitchen staff was noisy till the point that the chef was shouting swear words at his staff. Ambiance of a hawker stall. Past 2 years, all my chope selections have been accurate and most restaurants would be flexible when it comes to a toddler. Finally, being charges dinner bowls is not the issue, but a limited menu of 7 bowls is not value at all. Lastly, left a comment on FB and it was immediately deleted and a PM sent to invite us back! Enjoy
4
The food was so good! Love the aburi egg and the salmon mentaiko rice. But the only withdrawal is that people are allowed to smoke outside but the smoke always floats in. Wish they had the rice bowls in the day and i'll be there more often.
3
Found place by chance and was glad for my foresight to do a reservation before the visit to the otherwise full place. It was narrow and had few tables available. My friend and I were introduced to one of the few tiny tables for two. Service was great for the only waitress on floor. Food was not as great as what was pictured and main reason that lured us in. With the same price, maybe, the quality and portion could be improved on
3
Staff was friendly, food nicely presented Bt price a bit steep despite the happy hour drink price. Good for group and special dates. side note, tables were really tiny, shorter than most other space confined restaurants
3
Specializes in rice bowl and yakitori. Ricebowl is surprising to the tastebud since that's a touch of jap. Food price could be lower. Environment is too noisy.
4
This place was aesome. Just that the place was a little too stuffy.Food was good! Service was average.
4
Grilled beef ribs bowl - I enjoyed the bowl especially with the seasoning and the sauce that came on the rice, but beef could have been cooked slightly more (Some parts were Super rare). chirashi don was great (i changed them all to salmon cubes)!
4
Had a lovely time at MOJO. We brought along a dog and the staff was very accommodating (thank you!). We had the aburi broccoli (fantastic!), the beef bowl, striploin stick and the skin sticks. Do order the broccolis and striploin - well cooked! The skin yakitori was a tad too over cooked until the skin lost most of its fattiness, becoming really dry. It would be good to have some condiments to go w i
3
Went there on a Saturday afternoon hoping to try their protein bowl but was informed that it is only available on weekdays. So I had the Mojo Chirashi. For the price paid, the amount of sashimi given in the rice bowl is very worthy but too much for me. My stomach felt uneasy after having too much of the raw ingredients even though I eat sashimi quite often. I would recommend others to try the other rice bowls on the menu
3
The food was decent with big portion however on the salty side. I ordered the charashi and the yakitori dish. Charashi was good with fresh pieces of sashimi. Yakitori dish was on the salty side. Music was too loud and noisy for couples to enjoy a good meal.
3
Booked our table for 2 on the Chope app and when we arrived, we realised that it was absolutely packed (both the bar and the restaurant). We were shown to a tiny corner table which wasn't particularly appealing. Barely enough space to eat.The food made up for this experience - the foie gras/beef ribeye bowl is the best thing on the menu. Very flavourful and juicy. Things turned a bit sour when the bar staff tried to move us to the bar which was ridiculous. Luckily we had already finished and had asked for the bill. This was barely Â½ an hour into our reservation
2
I visited the restaurant to dine to celebrate my mother's birthday and advance father's day. The restaurant space is very small and there were limited seats. We were given a table for 4 in the middle of the passage way along the bar counter to the actually proper dining space. There was no air ventilation and felt very stuffy and squeezy. It was not a pleasant dinning experience for my family because the servers had to keep walking pass the tiny walking area while serving our table and we had to keep avoiding the server so as to no hinder them. It was very uncomfortable. The ambience of the place was so so. The food was good but not worth the price tag. It's was the upper class or an ATAS version of Tori Q. Overall my rating is very poor was due to the space of the place and the table that was given to us. I felt that the passage way should not have tables even though the place is small as it would give customers a catastrophic feeling.
4
We ordered the foie gra beef bowl and unagi bowl. The beef was average but foie gra was good and so was the unagi bowl. We also had a side of pork belly bun which was tasty. However, the food is on a slightly pricey end
5
The serving was pretty generous. The drinks and food are worth the money. However music is a bit too loud.
4
Food was great but the place trapped noise so .. it's very noisy to be able to talk. Waiters were attentive and helpful.
5
Had the foie gras and beef bowl and everything was on point. Great tasting martinis too! Would definitely come back for more!
4
Great food and a wide variety of drinks are available. Went with a group of 10, and the tables are small. Service was fast and excellent.
2
Ambience too nosiy. Food wise not up to standard. Yakitori sauce was too sweet. Sashimi also not fresh. Disappointed
It will be my first and last visit.
4
Ambience was alright. As space was pretty tight, tables were placed quite near to each other. Food was served pretty fast. Food portion for Don is just nice for one. Definitely a nice chill out place after work! Especially if you drink:)
3
We ordered the beef steak with foie gras rice bowl and the unagi and uni rice bowl. Both was delicious but for the price the portion was rather small and not filling. Ordered the martini 1 for 1 as well, its is quite expensive even though it's already half price. Strong alcohol content in their Martini. Seating arrangementâ€‹ wise, not very comfortable. Very near to the neighbouring tables due to limited space in the restaurant. Lack of privacy.
3
We were there for a group gathering to catch up on the latest in each other's lives. But we found ourselves having to repeat what we say or raise our voices. Guess the next table got to hear some of our stories. Noticed that most of the patrons were there to drink. The finger food has room for improvement. My friends who ordered the tsukune feel it doesn't work. The meat was too salty. It doesn't go well with the sauce either. The kitchen ran out of gizzards and liver. So there was nothing much else to try. The broccoli dish taste good.I had the chirashi don that was packed with sashimi. The young lady who served us was very diligent and efficient. She was quick to refill my friend's tea with hot water, a couple of times. The place is run by passionate young people who deserve to be supported
1
Terrible service, overpriced food. The service was bad - as our table had insufficient space to place the new plate of yakitori, the waitress just passed my hubby the plate and walked away, expecting him to arrange the food properly and find a space for the plate. Also, when they took my phone to scan the code for chope voucher, they returned the bill and forgot about my phone totally.Food was average, not worth the premium. Foie gras was the only nice food.
3
I feel that the marination on the yakitori was overbearing. Also, the opulent amount of teriyaki sauce that was poured over the rice destroyed the overall tasting experience of the rice bowl. Personally, I feel that if the meat is already well marinated, it will be perfect to pair it with plain white rice with just a dash of teriyaki sauce.Nonetheless, the martinis are nice.
4
Convenient place to go to and the pork jowl yakitori is a must-order! Short walking distance from Tanjong Pagar mrt.
4
Had the yakitori bowl for dinner at mojo and it did not disappoint. Big portion- definitely value for money!
5
Service was very gd! Food was beyond expectation! Love the environment too! Overall experience was amazing!
3
Had the weekend lunch bowl. Would wish there were more variety! Food taste great and generous portion for lunch bowl.
4
Aburri broccoli at its very best! Plenty of drink choices, especially the sake. The whole day one for one is a killer as not much places offer one for one everyday without time limits.
3
I ordered the beef and foie gras rice bowl and the beef had more tendon than meat, foie gras was seared nicely though. This cost $7 more than its similar twin at Tanuki raw. Service could be better as the staff that attended to our table could not manage our request of replacing foie gras with something else on the menu so if you do go there, please keep your orders simple. For the novelty of trying, this place is okay but not enough to compel you to come again.
3
located at the heart of maxwell, it serves a wide range of alcohol. food is not bad but the service staff can be more welcoming and prompt in service. accept reservation via online or by phone. place can get packed after office hours.orders got mixed up. dont quite understand how will 4 pax order 5 bowls of main dish. staff got rather upset when told of this. place is far too noisy, poor ventilation doesn't aid in this as well
2
Our food came almost 1 hour after we have placed our order due to a mix up by one of the male service staff. The place is way too noisy and hot for indoor dinning. They have over-priced their food and nothing special about them. Buying a bottle of white wine at $40++ is more worth it for paying for one glass at S$22++. Overall, do bother to come here for dinner. Cheer
4
MOJO provides a nice & cozy atmosphere - good enough for group of 2-6 to hang out. Staffs were helpful and friendly! We ordered foie gras & beef bowl - have checked w the staff if we can change the foie gras to beef as one of us doesn't take foie gras but the chef said no ): nonetheless we went ahead w ordering the bowl. Initially I thought there wasn't enough sauce to go w the rice, but turned out all the sauce was actually at the bottom of it. So the bowl turned out to be alil too salty because of the sauce. We also felt that the beef can be improved as there wasn't much taste to it - not sure if it's because the sauce is too overpowering. But overall it's a good foie gras & beef bowl! Good portion that's worth the money! Niwatoko-ume was legit too - MOJO didn't scrimp on the alcohol & we're happy about it. Will be back to try the lunch grain bowls
3
We were attracted by a huge ad indicating happy hour from 6-9 pm for all wine and beer but the accompanying image were their rice bowl. All of my friends thought that the one for one was for the four kinds of rice bowls and the drinks but I guess we should not have assumed. The Wagyu beef bowl was decent and there was a huge slab of foie gras and it tasted great. The skewers were so-so though. The famed broccoli was alright but it lacked any distinctive taste though it had a nice juicy texture when you bite into it, unlike most broccoli dishes. The most appalling bit about this place was that the wine is priced at $24 (and it still has to come with service charge and GST)! That's $12 per glass which is fine but it's really table wine. Nobody would price that at $24 then extend the happy hour - really quite ridiculous... they should just be upfront and say $12 wine during Happy Hour.
