Nice Chinese food. Special menu dishes. Sumptuous portions. Attentive service. Reasonable prices. A favourite restaurant for family dinner, birthday and anniversary.

Was invited here for lunch by a business associate from HK. He vouched that there food here is genuine. He even introduced Mr. Poon For Koo (Executive Chef) who personally and happily served us. The soy sauce chicken was soft and tender, quite unlike those sold at Chef Chan (the 1 Michelin star outlet). In fact, he said this dish had to be pre-ordered a day before. I was also introduced to the crispy yellow noodles (called "yellow on the outside"') served with pork pieces. The combination is certainly delicious to bite into. To round up, we also have tofu fried with mushrooms. Very enjoyable and will certainly come back for another round

Came to this outlet often with family, even for some or rant birthdays. Food was always well prepared n fresh. Tonight we have fillet of pomfret with vegetables, nai bai, yam ring, and cornflake prawn. Everything was well done down to the portions per person. 6 of us cost slightly about $110. Worth the meal n treat. Fine dining indeed. Place very suitable for small and big groups. Unfortunately they are closing by Dec 2016. Moving to new location at Outram Road. Will miss it.

I came here for a grassroots leaders' appointment ceremony. Our Chairman sponsored the banquet dinner and we were delighted to receive our appointment letters from the Minister. I found the ambience conducive for our event. The grand lustrous setting at the lobby area was well renovated with decorative flowers and the space was wide enough for group photo taking outside the restaurant and for the 70 of us to mingle around before proceeding into the restaurant ballroom. Along the alley into the restaurant was some window display of Chinese wine for culinary taste and quality abalone which further enlightened the visitors that this restaurant emphasized fine Chinese culinary arts and tradition. The interior of the ballroom where we had our dinner was spacious with grand bright lighting conducive for fine dining. The stage was also well set up for the appointment ceremony. We found the whole place all to our own with little disturbance from external noise. The table arrangement in cluster style was also conducive for interaction.I think the chef painstakingly put in quite a great effort to present the dishes in a unique appearance and it augurs well with the event. The first dish' the Four Delicacy Appetizer Platter was a great appetizer with crispy spring rolls and cold squid meat. I found the Stir Fried Shrimp with green seasonal green was extraordinary. The fried rice in lotus leaf was also great. I also liked the chilled mango cream with Pomelo and sago one of the best I had tasted. The waiters were prompt to fill up our glasses of tea or soft drinks and we had a great time enjoying our food while networking among ourselves. I think it would be ideal if some pipe music can be played throughout the dinner to create a greater atmosphere. Complimentary car park tickets were also given to car drivers saving the car park charges. This traditional Chinese restaurant may be gone or moved to another location once the government repossesses this piece of land where the country club is sited for the development of the railway terminal for the Singapore-Malaysia railway line from Seremban to Jurong East. But when this actually going to take place is still unclear. What is clear is that we can still enjoy the delicious food at the restaurant now and appreciate her existence before the next chapter of history commences

I was taken here for lunch by a business colleague. It is located within a country club, but the big trouble was parking!!! Most parking is for members only, so beware. We never did find a free spot after 10 min of looking, eventually my colleague parked in a member only spot, luckily no problem... The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and is very large. We were given a table promptly, but then again, it was mostly empty. This is around 12:30pm. We colleague ordered the set lunch and two dim sum orders. I was VERY happy with the food. Some fish portion was especially delicious. It started with a small pork taste, then a ginseng soup. To be honest, the ginseng soup was quite a rare taste for me, I never had this before, quite a strong flavor, but interesting. The dim sum were a prawn one and a fried dumpling, both were very good. The desert was mango milk thing that was wonderful. In all, the food was great and the service good. Price, I have no idea at all, my guess is expensive

Went here for the special DBS/POSB promotion, where the Peking duck is 50% off, so the discounted price is $28 (quite value for money in my opinion). We also ordered stir fried mushroom with asparagus, as well as some dim sum. The Peking duck was not bad, although a bit burnt in some parts. However, at $28, it is nothing to complain about, and it also comes with the usual dipping sauce and egg pancake for wrapping. The stir fried mushroom with asparagus was however quite disappointing, as it was overly oily to the point where we had difficulty in using our chopsticks to even grab anything. In addition, it's $24 price tag was quite ridiculous. The dim sum was average, nothing to rave about. Service was quite bad to be honest, some of the staff were quite rude and curt (not because they were ill-intentioned, but rather as a result of lack of proper training). There was no automatic filling of water or changing of plates, despite the fact that this restaurant markets itself as a fine-dining establishment. Over all, this is a restaurant that is past its prime, and it's once opulent and lavish decor now looks tacky and outdated. The service is like that of your local hawker center - brusque, curt, and non-existent. Everything is overpriced, except for the current 50% off promotion for the Peking duck (ends 31 May 2015). If you love Peking duck and your budget is limited, then this restaurant would be a good choice. However, keep your expectations low and try not to order anything else.

The restaurant looks like a perpetual elegant ballroom, with its plush carpet, white overalls and generous installment of chandeliers. From dimsum to a la carte menus to special occasions such as wedding banquets, this place offers nothing but comfort, impeccable service, beauty and good food. If fresh and flavorful is your kind of thing, then do give this hidden gem at Jurong Country Club a try.I had dinner here once a couple of years back during a friend's wedding banquet, and recalled it was good. I am glad for the chance to be back, to try their "Four Heavenly Kings" personal sets. I had the Braised Fish Maw & Scallops with Foie Gras Pate set (SGD$45.00) - marvelous!I began with this Deluxe Appetiser Platter - comprising of seaweed on cracker, fried shrimp / fish rolls, and octupus with crispy fried lotus root. The dainty items were fresh and promising, especially the shrimp rolls which had a lovely, prominent aroma - a good start of more to come.After the soup, I was served the specialty of Braised Fish Maw & Scallops with Foie Gras Paste - one has to recognise superior fish maw compared to the fried ones easily available everywhere. The fish maw was smooth, with a chewy, bouncy texture nearly like squid, only much softer. The gentle flavor was enhanced by foie gras pate infusion; and the pairing with succulent scallops was simply invigorating.Following that, I had the Stir-Fried Chicken Filet with Mint and Sweet Pepper, arranged artfully on a rectangular plate. The creation was lovely, with the stir-fried chicken retaining its natural sweetness, yet acquring a chargrilled-like texture and flavor. Prepared brilliantly with mint and sweet peppers, the dish reminded us of kebab - the healthier version.Being a small eater, I thought I was very full after the previous course, but when the Fuzhou Braised Rice was served next, I surprised myself by eating far more rice than I usually do. The gravy was awesome, tasty but not overly-thick or starchy like what one gets at some zichar stalls. It tasted strongly of the seafood it was prepared with, softening the rice to make every mouthful a worthy wonder.Finally, the conclusion of a sumptuous meal came in the form of Mango Sago - startlingly fragrant. In my experience with various mango sago desserts - the soup is usually creamy / milky and sweet, lacking in mango-aroma even though one could still enjoy the mango chunks within. This one - mango's aroma has its stamp from the light soup to the mango cubes all the way, cooling the palate like a dream.For the full review and more photographs, please feel free to check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/01/media-invite-dinner-at-fu-lin-men.htm
