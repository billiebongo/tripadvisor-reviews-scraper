The noodles are nice and i especially love the fishcakes. Due to its popularity, will need to queue for a while esp. on weekends. Usually will be closed after lunch time. You can also buy extra fishcakes which is priced by weight.

Because I saw the Food Wars on TV, I went to Holland Drive food court to try the fish ball noodle that won in the show. It was quite a long que during lunch time and I tried this dish. It was indeed good, the noodle was delicious while no fishy smell on the fish ball at all. Fish ball is not my favorite food but Ru Ji kitchen served it very well. Ru Ji kitchen certainly deserves to become the winner in the Food Wars
