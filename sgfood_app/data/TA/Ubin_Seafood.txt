Went here with a group of friends. Wanted to try the beef fat fried rice but was sold out. We ordered american beef steak and it was soooo good.

A short gum-boat ride from Changi Village (east Singapore). This little island takes you back to how SG once was. A lovely day trip, rent a bike and cycle around the island. Finish with a delicious seafood dinner at Ubin Seafood.

We have been frequencing Ubin since the ramshackle place in Sin Ming. Ordered the angus steak, salted egg soft shell crab, hokkien mee, coconut and barley. The awards are justifiable. Food has been consistent in quality and delivery. Service was unobtrusive yet efficient. My only grouse with Ubin is the reservation system. Could be improved.

Visited here with a colleague before a meeting in the business units located in the same complex. So it is a little odd to find a restaurant located in an industrial building but don't be put off. I didn't have seafood but can recommend the beef and the crispy coated chicken wings. Be warned, the portion sizes are ample. Overall a reasonable place to eat with good food. Would I go again? Yes

The restaurant looks simple and is lost in the middle of an industrial area. But it is definitely worth a try, especially if you are a group of 4 or more (as the portion are quite big and better to share).Ubin seafood offers a great seafood and also amazing beef (one of the best I had in Singapore) for an extremely reasonable price.Plus you can bring your own wine without any corkage price.A superb option for great but cheap meal with friends

A huge menu, with loads of different dishes to try from. A little bit out of the city but it's always full it seems so get there early or book. By the way I'm referring to the one at Sin Ming. My favourite dish is the salted egg prawn ....good wine list and some nice beers too

Hidden away in an industrial estate on Sin Ming Road, you will never find your way to this restaurant unless someone takes you there. But once you have tasted the food...you will try to remember how to go back. Serving all types of crab specialties. Cooked with black pepper, garlic, duck's egg or chili sauce. Live seafood. And another specialty dish... German pork knuckles cooked Chinese style. Simply delicious. Affordable too. No service charge. Allows guests to BYO wine. Great venue for Friday night heavy drinkers. Lots of parking. You can have your car serviced by the neighboring car garages while you have your meal. Just a suggestion. Not the place to have your annual Gala dinner to impress your boss...but ideal for entertaining expat bosses just to experience the unique ambiance. (outdoor private room separated by plastic curtains ! ) Yes. Air-conditioners in private rooms

It is a great place for a real crab feast. The deal of buy 2 crabs and get the 3rd free is still on now for years. It was packed on Sunday night, but the taste of each crab was great. The best Chille crab flavor in Singapore. I also had my favorite Salted egg crab and the plain steamed crab. Surprisingly the chinese style Ribeye steak was great too

This was my second visit to Ubin Seafood in its new location. It was very quiet with it being a Tuesday night. The food was very good - we had Black pepper crab and white pepper crab, squid with salted egg and a beef steak that came with claypot rice. The crabs were really good - very full and tasty. The salted egg squid is one of their best dishes and it was as good as the previous visit. The steak was good too and the claypot rice was very tasty. Overall, an enjoyable meal

I was at this restaurant for CNY reunion dinner and a few times later.I found the food delicious and the price reasonable.I would not compare it to coffee shop.This place has better food than coffee shops and it is air conditioned which made the dining experience comfortable.It definitely has much better food quality compared to some of the seafood restaurants along east coast and the price is relatively cheaper.The black pepper crab and the mee sua were some of my favourite.I ordered the ala carte menu for the CNY reunion dinner and the bill for 10 of us was slightly below $300, which i thought was very reasonable. Of course there was not much of a service. But if you want good service, then go to a fine dining restaurant. You can';t expect good service in this kind of place. You just want good food and hygenic and comfortable environment in this type of place and Ubin restaurant has achieved that
