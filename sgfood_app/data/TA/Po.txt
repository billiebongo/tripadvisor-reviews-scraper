We visited the restaurant on the 1st day of chinese new year and the quality of the food did not disappoint as premium ingredients were used. We highly recommend the delicious prawn mee and savoury pork ribs broth. Service was outstanding and we love the ambience
4
Popiah was wonderful with fresh ingredients. Satay was juicy and comes with fire grill. Atmosphere was cozy. Staff was attentiv
5
Staffs were thoughtful and food was great. Would definitely recommend family & friends to pay a visit to Po

Love the DIY popiah, filling was tasty and chilli was freshly made. The paper spring chicken and barramundi salad was amazing, though a little spicy for the salad. We had the Konbu Mee aka Hokkien mee, it was very authentic and local, the flavours were great and the sambal chilli was a good compliment. Overall, a great place to have good local food
5
Loved the decor of this restaurant and the food did not disappoint. The DIY popiah is a fun way to start the evening. While the meal was a little expensive, it is quite well priced considering the environment
5
Have tried countless Hokkien prawn Mee in Singapore but the Mee here is totally a different thing and it’s Divine! And the barramundi salad is not really a salad but more like a Asian style ceviche.. go well with a nice bottle of white.. it’s a pity that we are not big eaters so couldn’t order too much.. Mouth is watering again

Food was excellent. There was no bad dish, and majority were fantastic. This is the place for an array of elevated local multi-ethnic dishes. Service was lacking in promptness and initiative. Pace was also very slow as food took a long time to come after ordering. This place has lots of potential, but needs to fine tune the non-food aspects. Will be willing to give it another chance.

We had reserved a table for 3 for the 8.15pm time slot on a Saturday to celebrate my mum's birthday.On a plus side, the food and ambience was great. My favourite dishes were the mushroom with sambal, as well as the satay. The servers (the ones serving the food and taking orders) were prompt, professional and friendly.It would have been a truly great dinner, if not for the fact that we had to wait over 40 minutes for our table which I felt was unacceptable. We had arrived at the restaurant at 8.10pm, and was told that our table was not ready yet. Other guests who had arrived later were seated even before us. What is the point of having two separate seating timings for dinners when it is not taken into effect? By the time our first dish had arrived, it was already 9.15pm and we were starving. To add fuel to fire, we were only told once we had seated that the restaurant's star dish, the popiah, was sold out. This should have been made known to us earlier, and not when we already had to wait 40 minutes to get a table. This was especially frustrating as we had specially chosen Po to celebrate my mum's birthday, as popiah was one of her favourite dish, and the long waiting time had already marred the happy occasion.Perhaps it will be good to visit the restaurant at the earlier time slot, then you probably would not have the same negative experience that we faced
1
Food was okay, though we realized after our payment that we were overcharged some $10 for wine that we never consume...

Have been to the Warehouse Hotel a couple of times before for drinks, so decided to take a business guest there and then to Po for dinner. The popiah was definitely tasty and appreciated by the international visitor, as well as the other local dishes with the slight modern twist. The atmosphere in the hotel lobby is awesome, but much more dampened inside the restaurant. Pricing is on the high side (28 SGD) for the popiah, but good enough for 2 to 4 persons. Then again, it is inside a hotel restaurant. Would go back and take other guests in the future.

The place looks really nice and they have really managed to create a nice ambiance. We should however already started to understand where it was heading when the booking was somehow mixed up - when arriving gave our name and confirmed it was for 4 people (as booked online via Chope) and were shown to a table set for 6 people and when we pointed out that we booked for 4 we had to have a discussion why we were less than 6...We were unable to really get much information on the menu from the waiting staff so we ordered what we thought would be a decent amount of food. We specifically asked and got confirmed that everyone would get their main courses at the same time (as some of us would not share the food). Small starters arrived and they were really nice, tasty and fairly filling.Then the problems started, one main arrived (without the sides ordered - those never arrived) and when we asked for the other food we were told that it would come soon. After waiting 10 minutes more we asked again and were told 15 minutes - when we pointed out that we specifically asked for all the food to be delivered at the same time the waiter just left and after that all of the staff avoided coming to our table. Even when waving at them they refused to come over - 45 minutes after the first main had come the others came (the person who received the first had of course finished their dish). I once again pointed out that it was really poor to not do what was agreed - again no response at all from staff. Had to go to the hostess and complain and she did at least acknowledge that it was a mistake. She offered to provide free coffees. More reasonable would have been the waiter coming apologizing but he and the rest of the waiters refused to even come by our table so had to settle bill with hostess as well.The mains were also rather disappointing. The lamb was poor quality and very tough to chew. The chicken was very dry but rather nicely seasoned. For price level it was however disappointing.I understand that things can go wrong but just feeling so uncomfortable to manage it is just too poor so seems that there is no proper management at the restaurant nor any training of the staff. It would have been an easy thing to resolve, they should just at the first complaint apologized and taken the first main out and remade it to be ready with the rest of the food. Now they decided to just ignore and leave us unhappy and never to return again
5
The selection of food is minimal but exquisite. They have the finest selection of cured meat and cheese to go along with their salad. Their sour dough bread was amazing when paired with butter. There's cereal as well, but who needs that when you have what I had. The staff were friendly and very efficient. I was asked if I wanted coffee almost immediately when I walked in. Definitely a must
5
We have now left Singapore but just wanted to pass on our thanks for what was without doubt the meal of our trip (high praise especially in Singapore). The team were amazing and the food absolutely divine. We left Po with smiles and memories that will last a lifetime. Again many thanks for your hospitality and the genuine nature of your team as they took care of us so well. We look forward to our return to Singapore knowing Po will definitely be on the places to visit list again
5
The ambience here is great for a chill dinner and drink with friends or your partner. It's trendy but quiet and intimate enough for conversations. The food is an interesting twist to our local dishes, and it's super tasty. Service was too notch and staff were very friendly and professional. You should def check it out
5
This is an excellent place to showcase our hospitality! Truly enjoyed the popian, barramundi, beef cheek rendang and seafood porridge!! Great service and memorable dinner make possible with the great service!
5
Great showcase of local flavors with a twist of fusion. Popiah, Satay, Paper Spring Chicken to name a few are the popular dishes that one can try. Food is delightful to the palate and their homemade sambal chilli and achar is a must try.
5
We had our Christmas lunch at PO restaurant. Coming from overseas I was apprehensive if my family would enjoy the food as they can get really picky! :) I'm glad I went with PO restaurant as the food was EXCELLENT! My husband, who's not really a fan of popiah, for once- liked it! We ordered the satay skewers , charsiew, mahjong tofu.. Paper chicken..ALL GOOD! Service was excellent and the staff was attentive. PO Restaurant is highly-recommended!
5
Nice small restaurant with elegant atmosphere and very attentitive personnel. Try the poopiah, a traditional chinese dish simular to spring rolls, which do you do your own at the tabl
5
The food was very good, especially the barramundi salad and the veal cheek rendang. The staff was very friendly and smiley. A very good restaurant for nice local food
4
great place to bring foreign friends and family for a dinner. Food is local yet special, and the ambience is great, it feels like a lounge, but still somewhat colonial, very well re-done. Food was good, but a bit hit and miss, we enjoyed some of the dishes, like their signature dishes, while some of the meat dishes are not exactly value for mone

Located inside the Warehouse Hotel is Po. A play on the hokkien word Po po which means grandmother (?), the restaurant provides a modern take on traditional Singaporean cuisine, which is also known as ModSin. The brainchild behind Po was also responsible for another popular ModSin restaurant Wild Rocket. Rather immediately, you’ll get a sense that the restaurant speciality is popiah, which is a delicacy in this part of Asia, with a beautifully designed guide on your plate on how to make and eat it. This was a pretty delicious meal
5
Was recently at Po for dinner with family and friends visiting from Hong Kong. It was also a birthday celebration for our friend from Hong Kong. Warm and charming ambience. Helmed by the gentlemanly Alvin, who is also the resident wine specialist, together with the Crew including the affable Anthony, dinner service was prompt yet discreet and wine service was impeccable with much attention to details. The Krug was perfectly chilled; and Alvin calmly and deftly opened the vintage Barolo. Thoughtfully recommended by Alvin, we tasted a delectable cross section of the local contemporary Asian menu. Prawn popiah; ngoh hiang; truffle and duck kueh pie tee; paper wrapped baked spring chicken (rustic and aromatic with a delicate hint of shaoxing wine); braised lamb shank (succulent and falling off the bone); and shrimp and konbu noodles (robust wok hei with intense flavour from the rich broth it was stir fried with, and crispy texture from the fried sakura ebi). The birthday cake (we had earlier arranged for the cake to be delivered to the restaurant) was heartily brought by the Crew to the table, much to the delight of the birthday guest. Subsequently, the cake was efficiently plated individually. A fabulous evening. Many thanks to Alvin, Anthony and the Crew.Wudi

We had a great meal at Po, service was good, food was good and cocktails were good. Loved the 'hokkien mee', the Bak Kut Teh was superlative and the pohpiah we could have had a larger serving of. Probably would go back
5
Our second visit to Po. Great experience. Food good as ever. Excellent and prompt service. Beautiful plates and decor. Would recommend to friends
2
2nd visit as I had good first time experience with the restauarant.However, food quality and service standard both have deteriorated. The satay was more burnt that it should be. Even the customers at the table beside us commented the same, I had to remind the staff 3 times before my coffee was served, and the restaurant was not that crowded.Unless you want to enjoy the nice ambience, else it is better to find another place for good authentic local food.Though the booking stated there are two seatings, both times the restaurant was not crowded, and they didn't chase us out at 8pm.

Had an incredible dinner at Po! Was blown away by everything from the attentive, friendly staff to the amazingly delicious food and drinks! Had the prawn popiah which was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful! They could be slightly more generous on the prawns. The char siew was remarkable, don't think I've ever had char siew as good! Every bite oozed with flavour. The prawns & konbu mee was luxury hokkien mee. This was also delicious!! For the dessert, we ordered the ice cream popiah. This was EXACTLY the same as the peanut ice cream roll that i once had in a small tourist town, Jiu Fen in Taiwan. It was incredible and i've never been able to find it anywhere until I had the ice cream popiah at Po! The dessert came with 3 ice cream flavours, would highly recommend the peanut flavour. So so good!! Would highly recommend this restaurant! The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive as well! Overall was blown away by the restaurant! And am glad i booked ahead of time as the restaurant was full! Will def be back

I’ve been to Po about five times since it opened, and mainly for the poh piah. It’s really one of the best in town but sadly what detracts from the experience for me, and my friends eating with me each time, is how it was like pulling teeth to request for sufficient fillings to be served with the order. Believe me - we make petite to normal-size poh piahs but each time the fillings supplied, especially the hot radish filling, is only half the amount required for the order. Granted - we were told we can request for more - but each time we asked, we encountered great reluctance. E.g. being told ‘please finish everything in the bowl first’ (when there’s like a tablespoonful left), reminding 2-3 times before the waiter/waitress brings the extra portion out, and being given miserly top-up portions - even though it’s obvious we have quite a few poh piah skins left to fill! Other than this, and if I don’t order poh piah, the experience at Po is great. But I really enjoy the poh piah and would love to keep coming back, so please do something about making the experience better?
5
I brought my friend over to the restaurant a couple days on a Saturday evening (8.15pm) and was pleasantly surprised by the team with a mini birthday celebration prepared by the team (much to my surprise despite the fact I merely mentioned it was my friend's birthday on the date and didn't expect any pleasant surprises as such). The food and ambience was great and especially loved the satay they served. I would definitely come back to dine again
5
What a simply amazing restaurant. Food outstanding service perfection. The duck cones and the pepper crab outstanding Will be back!
5
Fantastic restaurant. Great menu. Staff very attentive and food amazing. We ate popiah, duck truffle, soft shell crab and pepper crab. Dessert banana fritters amazing.
3
I had better food at PO on my previous visit. Both the traditional and prawn popiah were good and the iberico satay was also enjoyable. Duck truffle kueh pi tee was good, the updated ngioh hiang was a unique take on a traditional dish but the sambal mushrooms was overpowered by the belachan while the beef cheek rendang lacked the oomph taste and flavor. Service was good and very attentive
5
We had an AMAZING lunch at the Po Restaurant in The Warehouse Hotel.The chef (ex-Ritz Carlton chef) is amazing! EVERY dish was equally tasty! My favorites are: - DIY Popiah (Spring Rolls); - Barramundi Salad (raw fish made to resemble what Singaporeans eat with their Congee at the hawker centers except that this fish is the Barramundi!); - Soft Shelled Crab with Mayonnaise; Konbu Mee (an atas version of the Hokkien Mee with prawns imported from Spain!); - Truffles & Duck Pie Tee - Konbu Mee (atas version of Hokkien Mee with Prawns imported from Spain)- Majong Tofu with Crab Meat (wow! Just order!)- Soft Shelled Crab with Mayonnaise (wow!)Please see pics!All their ice cream desserts are equally delish!! We have fallen in love with the food at this restaurant and will be back for more!Here’s my honest ratings:- Ambience: 9/10- Food Quality: 10/10! (Seriously!)- Service: 9/10- Food Presentation: 10/10!! Very instagram-worthy
2
We brought an outa town guest to Po. Also cos I love popiah. But upon arrival, we realised tat there is pork in the filling. My friend is a vegetarian. And I chose not to eat pork. So needless to say, we were very disappointed. My husband had the popiah and said it’s just ‘ok’. May I suggest tat Po introduces a vegetarian version of their popiah filling. My mom used to make popiah fillings, never w pork or any other mammalian meats. And her popiahs r amazing; juicy, w texture, fragrant and very tasty. The only commendable thing re this restaurant, is tat the service is very good. I appreciate our friendly waiter.
5
Service was excellent! The duck pie tee, veal cheek and seafood coffee are a must try!! The floor staff were attentive and attended to our table at the right time and made us feel very welcome and comfortable.
5
The Po restaurant located in The Warehouse Hotel was phenomenal. They were able to accommodate a party of 5, one of whom is in a wheelchair. We were seated right away and they were most helpful in explaining the menu to us as well. The food was simply amazing. My family and I loved making our own poh-pia , the tofu with spinach and crabmeat was very interesting and delicious. The saffron coconut rice rounded off our meal. The service was exceptional, the staff took very good care of us. I would highly recommend this restaurant located in Robertson Quai.

If you want a gilded versión of local cuisine, this is it.Limited though sufficiently diverse selection. However prepare yourself for sticker shock when you get the bill. $330 for 2, only drank beer with dinner. Cocktails not satisfactory. $20 for essentially a cup of ice.
4
Quirky ambience in a small boutique establishment - Warehouse Hotel. Good local food with choice ingredients which I suppose justifies the high prices. The satay was absolutely delicious. Unusual version of bak kut teh and they call it pork bone broth. Duck pie tee and traditional kueh pie tee were both quite good. Ngoh hiang was a crispy deconstructed version which we didn't like. Kurobuta char siew was succulent but not the best I've had. Perhaps what was most disappointing was the overpriced popiah which is their signature dish - This is much better in the hawker centres at a fraction of the price. Veal cheek rendang and prawn Mee were good. Paper chicken was tasty but it is really a 45 minute wait for preparation! We tried all 3 desserts and loved the goreng pisang best - round balls of banana deep fried crisp and served with ice cream.
5
Celebrated Mid Autumn Festival at Po. Our 1st time there. Food was superb, enjoyed the meal very much. Compliments to the chef
5
Everything about the dining experience at Po was wonderful. The meals were delicious and there were a wide variety of dishes to choose from. We particularly enjoyed the Popiah and Barramundi salad. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were generous. The staff were very professional, welcoming and attentive. I would highly recommend dining at this restaurant if you are in Singapore. The venue is modern and it has a good vibe. Cocktail list was impressive and drinks well presented. We were lucky to find this little gem!
5
Had a wonderful dinner last night with Oversea guest !! Great popian, barramundi salad, kombu noodle, barramundi tail, beef cheek randang! Overall great meal with excellent service !
5
The star of the show the Po-piah is quite excellent. It isn't terribly expensive for what it is, but it isn't cheap. The atmosphere of the restaurant though is undeniably cool and kinda sexy, considering the branding is of a grandma. Bring lots of friends along, bring your funky grandma along. You won't regret it. Though grandma may say that she can make better popiah, she will enjoy the yummy cocktails and the interesting mains. (The prawn mee is so intensely prawn-y you can probably get an allergic reaction just be smelling it...

Made reservations for my sisters birthday and called twice to confirm seat numbers and upon arrival they still had a confusion. Dinner was great, the food was delicious and packed with flavour. I really enjoyed the satay, the barramundi ceviche, kailan, and lamb shank we ordered. Really really great dishes! Downsides: The restaurant is pretty beautiful but what was annoying was the blinding light from the kitchen right in my sight line was horrible every time the door swung and was left open. We were finishing our meal and weren't even done when some waiters started roughly stacking chairs on and around tables. Loudly placing things down, dropping cutlery and then dropping a flower vase behind my friend and a bit of water splashed on her. The service quality was not up to par with my expectations of a restaurant of this standard. Unfortunately, quite a disappointment.
4
Was with my family celebrating the birthdays of all the September babies at home. The manager and floor staffs were very attentive. The food I must say is nothing much to shout about. But the food presentation and the staffs made up for it. The overall ambience of the restaurant fantastic. I would recommend friends for a cozy catch-up session with friends and family.
3
Creative modern take on Singapore favorites - cannot be faulted in that regard. I do wonder if they can do something though about the attitude. I had a reservation at 2:15 pm only to walk in and be told they are closed When I informed them I had a reservation they grudgingly gave me my table but as I was handed the menu they said the kitchen is closing- not even a minute to look at and study the menu. Then constant hovering - the minute we were done with the main course the waitress came to hand me the bill without me asking. I told her I needed dessert which then was provided after I asked. I am amazed at this - do not take a reservation for 2:15 if this is the attitude they will take. For a place where we paid over 400 dollars for two for lunch I do not believe this is the right behavior
5
My family and I visited Po restaurant recently for a birthday celebration. We were presented the menu, achar and wet towel the moment we sit down. We ordered many dishes and every dish we ordered did not disappoint us. My family especially loved the ngoh hiang, satay, popiah and sambal mushroom. The service was well executed too. Our tea is constantly refilled without having to wave for the staff and all the staff serve us with a smile. My family and I really liked the ambience and lighting of the restaurant as well. Jack, the manager was especially attentive. He even offer to hold my aunt's shopping bag while she visit the washroom which was commendable. Overall, we had a great dining experience and will definitely be back! :

Great place for groups of friends. Good service, and quality food combines with a fairly priced winelist. . . that allows froeigners to try their first steps in quality Singaporean cusine skilfully helped by some very friendly waiters..
5
@TheKuoKnowsPo knows a thing or two about Peranakan food. They have taken the best of the Straits cuisine and turned it into an unmatched fine-dining experience.The Classic Popiah is a great way to start the meal. It's also a wonderful ice-breaker to get a conversation going. What do you put in? What do you leave out? How much sweet sauce should you add?The Paper Spring Chicken takes about 40 minutes to prepare. That's just about enough time to savour the Popiah starter. The fragrant chicken, which is stuffed with glutinous rice, makes for a sensational centre piece........ Add in a Veal Cheek Rendang and a stir fry Kai Lan, and you have the makings of a superb meal for between four and five people comfortably. Achar is complimentary.Po gets top marks from me. Food is fab; staff is superb and the ambience is awesome. Can't wait to go back
4
Housed in a conserved warehouse that is now a boutique hotel with a modern industrial decor, this cosy restaurant offers local dishes with a creative twist
5
A unique range of cocktails and food. The popiah and paper spring chicken stood out in particular. Service staff were friendly and responsive, and all the dishes were well-presented
5
I like the ambience of hotel lobby & the restaurant Po. Well decorated with old fashioned mirror where Po Po used to use. Staff very friendly n helpful. The food is uniquely presented. Love the duck with truffles Pie tee, the wrapped baked chicken stuffed w glutinous rice is delicious too. We enjoyed all the dishes. Tks to our friends who introduced this place. Hv one suggestion for hotel entrance, the glass awning is not built far out enough. The lady staff n us were drenched getting into car at driveway in the pouring rain that day we went. Beautiful nice bed rooms but the side facing the road has no view. The side facing the river is excellent.
5
We had our lunch at Po, we tried the Popiah which is beyond excellent than the normal popiah, its a must try dish. We also had soft shell crab, Salad, Spicy Barramundi tail and mushroom. My new favourite is the soft shell crab since i love seafood and its savoury. Thank you so much for accommodating us. Good service above all..

We tried out Po for a family dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant serves local food with a twist. For example tiger prawns with Pohpiah, scallops in congee and clams etc. The portion sizes can be large (especially the Pohpiah) so be careful about how much you order. We tried the Pohpiah, congee, vegetables, satay, and kueh pie tee. Overall the food was average. The Pohpiah was pretty good. However, the satay was too thick and tough. The kueh pie tee was with duck and truffle so was odd. The ambience was also odd - the restaurant was ice but had dimmed lights and was quietish (so feels funny for a Singaporean restaurant). If you like your local food without a fusion twist, I would probably give this a miss.
5
The Po staffs were so polite and friendly. The foods they served were so delicious. Especially the satay on the grill. It was kinda fun by grilling the satay on our own. Oh the duck truffles pie, just one melt into your mouth you will be WOW! The BBQ Char Siew was one of the best we ever eaten. And the Grill chicken with lotus rice took about 45 minutes and was worth the wait. Limited foods but all were their signature dishes. The foods never disappoint us as whatever we ordered were so yummy. The Senior Assistant Manager (Jack) impressed me with his cheerful smile and surprised us with drinks and dessert before we left the hotel. Everyone were so fantastic. Would like to special thank: Jack, Jayson, Charlene & Sefalyn. We will definitely be back! Thank you once again for the memorable surprises
5
I have dined at the restaurant several times, to the extent, the staff already know me by name, which is always nice. It is my restaurant of choice when hosting clients and overseas guests. Firstly coz its located in Singapore's hippest hotel, secondly because it gives some of my favourite local food a more modern twist. Some of my favourite dishes are the barramundi salad, ngoh hiang, prawn mee, bak kuet teh and paper wrapped chicken. After a meal, its always nice to have cocktails at the lobby, my favourite cocktails are High Tea and Kopicat.
5
We had popiah, truffle & duck pie tee, Iberian satay, carabinero prawns & konbu mee and paper spring chicken for 2. Service staff did inform me it might be too much for 2 but we decided to go with it as there were so many dishes that we want to try.. (Thanks for informing! ) Food was excellent, love the glutinous rice stuffing in the paper spring chicken. Couldn't decide on which was my favorite dish. Even though we were there late.. they did not rush us through our meal. Service staffs were attentive & friendly. Thank you for the warm hospitality, jack! Will definitely be back to try their new menu.
4
The food was surprisingly good! Especially the kombu noodles and popiah. Great dinner place with friends
4
The intelligence and creativity and tastes of the whole menu was a real treat. The whole ambience of the cocktail bar and the restaurant was very calming - music you could hear, but comfortable converse over, cool surroundings and very good bar staff. But it was all a little let down by the restaurant staff who were unfamiliar with the whole menu and the wine list, who brought the wrong main course, half way through the appetiser, and then brought the two main courses 5 mins apart (we presume they'd overlooked one of the ordered main courses) and left us floundering whilst the fist main course delivered went cold.
5
Calm atmosphere And great food to Enjoy! One of best restaurants i tried in Singapore. You have to go there!!
5
Had a lovely dinner with excellent service with my two friends. The food was really delicious, with the experience of making your own popiah roll an authentic novelty in modern day restaurant settings. A quiet restaurant in the middle of a bustling city, it would be really wonderful to settle right in for a meal to take your mind back to the food that your (Asian) grandmother will make
5
My experience at Po is an familiar yet refreshing one. The dishes they serve are asian fusion style and its like tasting classic asian food but with a luxurious feel to it. I like how they made the ice cream popiah which is a remake of the classic popia
4
The dishes maybe common in many families but they are done well and with good ingredients. So the higher prices are for ingredients quality, flavour, and ambience. The popiah dish is nice and good portion. The tofu side dish is excellent. The cocktails are imteresting too.
5
Had dinner at Po when we stayed here. Superb atmosphere and even better dinner & drinks. Love the way the Popiah was served and the Paper Chicken was great. Authentic stuff... even better hawkers in Singapore. Have already booked my next round here with friends. The Breakfast we had at the restaurant was fresh and bountiful - loved the Bah Ku Teh and Porridge, service was relaxed and coffee was to my taste. See you all soon
5
The restaurant has great ambience, with attentive and friendly service staffs, who helped explained and recommended dishes to us. Dishes were delivered promptly and nicely plated. Carabinero Prawn and Konbu mee was my favourite. Adding the sambal belachan to the flavourful noodles is the best combination
4
You can tell a lot of detail went into interior, plates etc and all was well done. Items on the menu were nice but all quite heavy and not a lot of vegetable options to help break it u
4
We had 10 pax, our reservation was the 1st sitting. Staff reminded us that we have to vacate by 8pm for the next sitting. We left at 815pm and prior to that, they were still serving us patiently. Not rushing us to go off. We ordered 2 sets of popiah, Chicken, satay, char siew. 1 calamari, ngoh hiong, all 3 desserts and drinks, total costs was 650+. Which we thought was ok. We love the chicken, very tender. Glutinous rice which came with it was delicious. Generous fillings for the popiah. Had so much leftover as we used up the popiah skin. Personally I don't like the pork satay. The meat is a bit too thick. Love the desert as well. Especially the yam, pineapple and ginger flavour ice cream
4
The ambience, service and food was great! But it is a little pricy and since they are selling local food, some may not taste as good as compared to the hawker centers'.
5
Had dinner at the restn with my partner last week for my birthday. Previously, had lunch with my colleagues and fell in love with the food, so I had to come back. Popiah was amazing, the diy was a very fun and innovative touch to the experience. The small plates are a definite must-haves. Decided to go for the mouth-watering konbu mee, however was slightly disappointed as it was too wet and not as tasty as the one I rmb. Food aside, I would like to point out the personalized touch in service is very commendable. Knowing that it was my birthday, the surprise with a dessert arranged by Jack, was very sweet, along with the notebook and personalized card. I truly had a good time and would highly recommend it to my friends and family
4
It was pricy but the food did impress. You should reserve this place for a special occasion. .......

The food at the lobby of Warehouse Singapore is supplied by Po, a locally infused modern restaurant helmed by Chef-Partner Willin Low, founder of Wild Rocket. You probably wouldn't expect good finger food at most hotel lobbies but this one bucks the trend, it's actually good. We ordered about 5 different bar snacks from the menu and the charcoal grilled iberico pork satay is the best of the lot. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. The accompanying satay dip have a good mix of peanut and garlic to give it a slightly tangy taste. We had the black ink calamari which is also quite good. It comes with a base of salted egg yolk as a dip, ultra delicious. The Ngoh Hiang is done flat instead of a roll and is very crispy. The taste was ok but well paired with the sweet sauce and Balachan Chilli, a Peranakan favourite. We also ordered the fermented shrimp soft shell crab. We couldn't really taste the fermented shrimp but the crab was well prepared and is actually juicy even after it has been deep fried. The kurobuta char Siew, the last dish, was a little underwhelming after having the rest. The taste is familiar to the better char Siew places in town. We each ordered a mojito to go with the food. Overall a fantastic choice for meeting up with a small group of friends.
1
The food was really sub-par. The char Siew (BBQ pork) was dry and tasteless. The popiah (namesake of the restaurant) too was not good. The skin thick, dry, chewy. The pie tee was not awful, just very mdediocre. The pork satay had an ok taste but it was very undercooked. When I pointed it out to the server he said that it's supposed to be that way. There was a version of prawn noodles - that was quite tasty but a little too salty for me. That was probably the only dish that was acceptable.
3
The main problem about this place is the commute. There is no parking so better not to drive. However, there is like no taxi stand or taxis turn before they reach the hotel so couldn't get a taxi there on Friday night. Its also not at the main Robertson Quay area so walking is a little more troublesome. Food was enjoyable as we had really good company that night. We had the soft shell crab and the pie tie. Didn't like the satay as the fumes made my eyes all watery. Overall food was of good quality but In honestly there are so many places in Singapore that have this food with better venues. This venue wasn't very special

Our dinner at Po was an enjoyable evening out. The Warehouse Hotel certainly lives up to the buzz for its cool vibe, but it was the quality of the food and service at Po that really made our night. We had the popiah, veal rendang, calamari, prawn noodles, and various desserts, and everything was top notch. Definitely worth an evening out, and not just for drinks

Visited on a Tuesday evening, second sitting.Ambience - dark (ie difficult to read).Menu - seems to be trying too hard and yet it 'feels' as if there is little variation available, particularly for vegetarians.Cost - not cheap. We spent nearly $1,500 for 6pax (all the more strange considering various signature dishes are DIY at the table).Service - absolutely terrible. Probably the worst we have had in Singapore. Literally no excuse for the lack of engagement from the staff, no working knowledge of the menu, zero proactivity or foresight (at times we felt that we were teaching them how to serve), very difficult to catch their attention, a real sense that none of them were committed at all. Nothing redeemable whatsoever. Sadly, even if the food had been superb, the evening would still not have been enjoyable.A real shame and hopefully the place will deal with the issues in time. However, as of right now its offering is simply not good enough, particularly for a restaurant that is trying to be 'higher end' rather than 'middle of the road'

Great dinner and especially loved the DIY popiah as well as the Char Siew. Make sure to go for drinks before or after in the beautiful lobby bar of The Warehouse Hotel. The BB King is a must have there

Beautiful building!In the resto I had the Char Siew and Rendang. Char Siew was just meat, no sauce. Boring and without flavour. Maybe I chose poorly. Rendang was fatty and had no rice. It was tasteless. I could have had better food at a hawker centre. Also, waited for a long time to be attended to

Suitable for business meetings, great place for local food delights transformed to fine dining. Give a go at wrapping your own popiah, bet you'll won't be able to get the experience from local Hawkers. As a local, I highly recommend satay and seafood congee. Everything else was good, but nothing beats my Mother-in-law's Peranakan pie tee, ngio hiang and popiah.. sooooo... I won't be giving an accurate recommendation for the rest. Lastly, remember to make reservation

Friendly and efficient staffs provided us clear description of almost all the food in the menu before writing down the orders. They also make sure we don't order too much and have some "space" left for their unique desserts. Do give their cool selection of tea a try, thanks Jack for the recommendation! Overall lovely ambience and food

Yes, The Warehouse Hotel is a great addition to the Singapore hotel scene - cool space and vibe, good cocktails. Po however doesn't deliver. All the more disappointing knowing that chef Low of Wild Rocket is associated with it. We dined with friends at Po last night, arriving at 7:30 in time for a cocktail in the lounge before our 8:15 reservation. Frustratingly, we had requested a 7:30 reso only to be told that they could only accept an 8:15 reso. Upon arrival, the table was ready and in fact the restaurant wasn't very full. The menu and food was very good, even excellent. What completely let down and ruined the evening was the very clunky, awkward and unprofessional service. The novice (felt like a bunch of trainees!) staff were clueless how to greet diners, describe the menu and dining style, take orders, pace the meal, etc., etc. Plates were cleared (or attempted to clear) while we were still eating, no follow-up on our wine order, informing us the kitchen was closing and 'last orders' due when we honoured our 8:15 reservation. Note that the lounge bar service was equally weak. In summary, what could have been an enjoyable evening was all but ruined by poor service

Food was really good! Service too! Will definitely be back again real soon! It would be better if there were credit card promotions

The ice cream popiah abit disappointing as it just a three favour with the popiah skin. But if you have eaten the popiah then dessert also come with popiah skin will be kind of boring. Nothing specia

Finally got a table , great lunch , loved the popiah and all the rest , all fresh and well prepared , portions are pretty big so we ended up cancelling on main course. Team served us well , a great experience

The Tiger Prawn Popiah was really good, but I felt they could be more generous with the popiah skin and prawns for the price we paid. Also kind of disappointing that we didn't manage to order the Flower Crab popiah as they had a limited qty for lunch. Service was top-notch and special thanks to the Manager, I can't remember his name. And thank you so much for the complimentary birthday desserts for my parents, they had a wonderful time and enjoyed the food

Was determined to sample the local fare at Po after numerous unsuccessful dinner reservations as the restaurant was fully booked a month before hand! So was very excited when I finally made it there for lunch.Immediately like the charming and cosy interior of both the hotel (The Warehouse Hotel) and the restaurant. And the food did not disappoint.The signature house specialty Popiah is the best I have ever tried, albeit expensive. Just 4 pieces of popiah skin enough for 4 pieces of popiah roll at S$28 for the Classic version while the Tiget Prawn version is S$38 and the Flowet Crab version is a whopping S$58. The slow stewed and very finely cut turnip, shoot, tow kiah and dried shrimps were very flavourful, fragrant and robust and the whole presentation very refine and attractive. 2 rolls per person allow us just enough room for 2 more exquisite dishes, the squid ink calamari and excellent Iberico Satay served with pineapple paste and peanut sauce. The dessert selection is very small with just 3 items. The Teh Halia Panna Cotta was just average...Would have loved to sample the other cuisine like Bakuteh, Paper wrapped chicken and Barramundi salad but would have to revisit on another occasion as we did not wish to over indulge and ended up not doing justice to the food. The yotal bill with GST and service charge came up to S$92 but we were very happy and pleased with the overall dining experience.

Visited the restaurant with my 3 year old and 5 year old. They were noisy as usual and almost turned the restaurant upside down before i managed to calm them down with the good food and help from the friendly staff.The popiah taste very good. DIY with written instructions given definitely helps. You can choose how the amount for all the fresh ingredients provided and there is more than enough to fill the 4 popiah skins

I really enjoyed making my own Popiah (Chinese Burrito). Po made it really fun and the presentaion is fun and inviting. The Satay tasted like how I remembered it to be as a child, grilled on charcoal, and tender meat. The raw fish salad was amazing as well, but beware of the fiery red chili peppers

I felt the need for the management to know about this incident. I never felt so cheated by a restaurant before.The bad experience started when my friend and I decided to book Po for my birthday dinner. He walked to the host stand and made a reservation and at the same time, reserved their signature Paper Chicken (which required 45mins waiting time). The reply we got was kind of ridiculous - we can't pre-book the chicken and if they have balance for the day, you can then order it. I was thinking "err ... I won't wait for 45mins on that day itself".On the actual dinner day, we found out that the chicken was pre-booked for us. Great (or so I thought!)...The disaster began when the Chef actually knew one of my friend. I would think that the dishes would be specially well taken care of. We ordered popiah, char siew, veal rendang, paper chicken, seafood congee and 3 desserts. In between our food, the waitress actually brought us additional dishes - soft shell crab, prawn noodles, ngoh hiang, raw fish. We told them we didn't order that and the reply was "it was complimentary from Chef". We didn't feel that was anything wrong as we received nice gestures from restaurant before and actually felt appreciative.The bill came and all the items that we didn't ordered was charged. When we asked the staff to check with her Chef as we understood that they were complimentary and we didn't order those. She replied that the Chef had given us complimentary desserts instead. But that is not the same and not the point! As it was my birthday dinner, my friend just settled the bill and not to turn the celebration night into a nightmare.I don't think is right for the Chef to send us dishes we didn't order and not even informing us. And please don't say it is complimentary, that word means "free of charge" and not replacing it with cheaper items

Had little fun in making our own popiah by filing the ingredients and rolling into creative shape ....The barramundi salad is another must try in this restaurant,flavourful and very appetising .... not only the nice food,all staff as well as the manager,Alvin are very attentive and friendly to us...from guiding us through the menu till have a small chit chat with us makes our visit memorable.

New restaurant in town with good service. Must try their po piah , barramundi salad and satay , highly recommended. Service was excellent especially the manager in charge .

We arrived at 6pm but the manager was still briefing the staff so we had to wait in the lobby. Waited till nearly 610pm after we reminded them we want to be seated early as they had called and said they wanted table back at 8pm! We liked the food created by Willin Low but not the restaurant. Entrance was facing a toilet and our table was near the toilet. Service staff were courteous and good enough as it is difficult to find good service staff in restaurant these days. We ordered the fried " hokkien noodles" but asked to not have the big prawns. We expected them to replace the big prawns with more pork or small Sakura ebi but we just got a small miserly portion without the big prawns at same price!! Tables were too big for 2 ppl, and the inside of restaurant was just functional!! So the decor inside felt functional and lacks any ambiance. We liked the warehouse lobby which was more cosy. Overall very bad value for money.

A dining experience that is consistent, aimed at delighting patrons with good food and service. With notes of nostalgia and back to basics offerings, the decor and intimate space was complemented with service that is from the heart. It is rare to find staff that look you in the eye and give you a warm smile these days and by itself says alot of the emphasis of warm dining.
