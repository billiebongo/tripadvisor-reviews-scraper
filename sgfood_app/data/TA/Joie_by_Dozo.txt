What a wonderful artistic delight this restaurant is. The private Japanese type style of room within the space. And the eclectic degustation of 6 courses, could not be recommended more highly
4
Service was immaculate and food was served timely. It was a one of a kind vegetarian dining experience I never had before. Whole dinner was totally pleasant and nice. However hoped for a bigger portion as we ended going home feeling a bit hungry still

Invited by a client for lunch (who knows I'm a vegetarian), I was very curious to see what Joie was about. A pure-vegetarian menu is, after all, fairly unique in Singapore. Although a little tricky to find (in Orchard Central, take the lift/elevator to the 9th floor, then switch to another elevator that takes you to the 11th floor, and then take the escalator up to the 12th floor), the experience of eating at Joie is well worth the effort to get there. Lunch is a 6-course menu (dinner is 7 courses). Each course offered very interesting and intriguing choices. All the food was beautifully presented, delicious, and creative, and the view was lovely. There are menus for no dairy or no eggs, too, which I really appreciated. The service was excellent - very attentive (important over a short lunch hour) and very knowledgeable about the menu's unique choices. The prices are very reasonable - only $38 for lunch and $68 for dinner. I loved this place and am looking forward to going back again, next time for dinner. If it's as good as lunch was, I'll be going back to Joie regularly

I had dinner at this restaurant with two colleagues. The food was excellent. It was a six-course meal of relatively small plates. There were several highlights. I had a cold appetizer of veggie sashimi that was excellent. The entree was a mushroom steak with mashed potatoes served over hot rocks. The consistency and flavor of this dish was also wonderful. My only complaint was that they were out of several of the wines on their wine list.
5
Feasting with your eyes. The menu at Sing $68++ menu was superior to most, providing an exciting surprise in each of the 6 courses. Memorable presentation of high-quality food will have us going back and taking our international friends. The exciting environs with a Japanese modern twist add to an evening to remember. Service was attentive, efficient & very friendly.The wine list was the only minor disappointment. Not able to offer first two choices of our choices. We would recommend this restaurant & will be returning.

I visited the restaurant for dinner on a saturday night. We both had a glass of wine and the 7 course dinner. The final bill was 200$, but we were able to get very satisfied and full. Big variety of dishes (with/without mushroom if you are not a fan). Good service and nice experience for an anniversary, quiet and nice atmosphere.Last order was 9pm
5
How to describe this experience? It's hard! because it was just amazing!!!From the moment we walked in we were treated impeccably, we had a separate room where we enjoyed a 7-course menu. As you will see in my pictures each course was a world of delicious tastes. As I am vegetarian abroad and lactose intolerant this restaurant was a dream come true. It was an experience within itself, other than the amazing dishes the service was impeccable, the staff were so friendly and attentive and we even got a special welcome to Singapore desert. Whoever is reading this - Don't miss out on this restaurant - you will not be disappointed - I assure you!!
5
Joie is an experience!! I recommend the 6 course Set Lunch for $38.80. I LOVE meat but don't even mind this restaurant is vegetarian because it is so delicious and fun to eat through. So many beautiful dishes.I recommend:Gratinated Champignon with MozzarellaTruffle RisottoI loved the Hawaiian Blue to drink: ~House mocktail of lychee and blueberryThis place is not only delicious but all the dishes are really nicely presented and its an experience. Reasonable price as well.Though hard to find, it is on the TOP floor of the mall
4
Offers a set menu concept allowing diners to pick their desired dish for each category. Dishes can be catered for those with specific diet restrictions, such as garlic / onion / dairy / eggs. Nice decor and ambience, suitable for dining with friends, and fancy enough for a business meal without a super high price tag.
5
Never under estimate vegetarian cuisine. This is a fusion restaurant, that serves a course meal set. I was amazed and i can recommend this even you are not a vegetarian, this is a worth a try. Price wise good enough and can blown your mind away
5
Enjoyed the food here very much. Lunch is 6 course set meat and very well executed. Love the presentation and the taste. Will definitely eat here again.
5
My girlfriends and I loved this restaurant. We sat outside, very comfortably. The service was impeccable. The food was so interesting and delicious. We will definitely go back.
5
Joie offers a set menu where each guest can choose their dishes. The food was well above my expectations for a vegetarian restaurant- it was delicious, with each dish beautifully arranged and decorated. Each and every dish we ordered was delicious. The service varied between the staff, with the manager (I believe) being very professional and helpful, while the rest of the staff seemed less motivated.
5
I came to celebrate a friend's birthday. I didn't request for any special arrangement but the crew thoughtfully prepared a small cake with a candle and beautifully wrote a birthday wish on the plate for my friend. That actually surprised me too! The quality and presentation of the food and the service were incredible. It was almost like a dining spa at this restaurant. I'd recommend couples to come here for dating. ;) Though the portion of the food might seem small, it was pretty filing. You can check out their menu on their website. I'd recommend the lunch set which is more value for money than the dinner. Get a window seat so you get the sunlight and the view and every dish turns out very picturesque too! The price may seem a little high, but it's a good experience! Thank you Joie!

Been there for a Celebration with friends.Great Vegetarian Restaurant with a creative and interesting take on modern Chinese/Asian food.The Dining Room can get a bit cold at times but the service is very attentive and helpful.Great Vegan choice available upon requestWill be back for sure
5
We loved this place. Excellent wine menu at decent prices and the food blew us away. Seven courses, all excellent and bill was very reasonable. Great presentation of dishes, spectacular crockery, great service. My favourite was the salmon-texture carrot with exploding raspberry. Only problem was we had to go via Orchard Central which was busy and stressful and impossible to get a cab home! Not the restaurantâ€™s fault but I would have thought such a great restaurant would be in a more civilised location.
5
In Singapore it's not easy to find good vegetarian food. Joie is one of the most unique vegetarian dining experiences I've ever had. What they create here is really tasty and very different from anything most people will have lad before. I took my partners whole family here for a birthday and they thoroughly enjoyed it. It's best to have the tasting menu and enjoy lots of different things. If you are after the best deal then go for the lunch as pr8ces are far cheaper than in the evenings.

Went there with my siblings ( 6 of us ) to celebrate my sister's 50th birthday dinner. It is a 7 course dinner. I must say the ambience and food presentation is superb. Food is so-so and very small portion. Overprice for the quantity and quality - compared to other vegetarian restaurant like SuFood and Elemen . I know this is fine dining but rather disappointed with the portion given.Anyway, we have a private room to ourselves which is nice :
5
We enjoyed a 7 course dinner at Joie by Dozo late sept 2017. The food was delicious, creative, tasteful and well balanced. The mushroom hot pot was awesome and the set starter was booming with favor. The only dish that brought us down slightly, was the lime tofu that didn't really taste too much. But all in all a great experience. And - great service
5
The restaurant was nice and the ambience was relaxing. We went in for an early lunch. It was a 6 course meal. Everything was nicely prepared and the presentation was quite an experience. The waiters seen very passionate about the food served and took great pride in educating us on the sequence and the way to consume each dish. The experience was one of a kind
4
I recommend this restaurant, the proposal is quite original. 7 courses menu for dinner, all vegetarian, and with an effort to offer different tastes and textures.
Quite different to what you find elsewhere, worth trying.
5
Such an interesting take on Vegetarian food. Each course that we had was delicious. Definitely a place to go to again.
4
I was not expecting anything different from the usual vegetarian food but was pleasantly surprised by their care in plating as well as the unique flavour in the food.
4
Hey went to this place with my family y'day to celebrate my mom's b'day. I have to say it is simply out of the blue. It's a vegetarian restaurant offering western Japanese cuisine at the topmost level of Orchard Central. Not only is the place beautiful by it's aesthetics and looks but it offers a unique dining experience of a seven course meal. There are drinks available as well. Overall a wonderful experience and recommende
5
The best thing was everything here is pure vegetarian. it's a mix of Japanese and Italian and they have a relatively flexible fixed menu for lunch. the presentation of the food was amazing and the lunch spread was 7 course! even though each portion looks tiny when laid out, it was quite filling. I want to definitely go there more often if I can
5
Wow!!! Is my first reaction to the classy ambience and table set up. The menu presented by the waiter is unique, with fusion of French and Japanese vegetarian dishes. Good combination of about four to five choices of cold dishes, soup, side dishes, main dishes and deserts. The waiter recommended 7- course dinner set. This dinner set almost consisted 90% of dishes listed in the menu. Highly recommended for vegetarian food lovers. The price to pay is classy ambience with great friendly waiters and creative presentation of the vegetarian food.Bravo to the Chef of Joie restaurant

We visited Joie on Saturday night and greatly enjoyed ourselves overall.First of all, the food is very good indeed and it is clear that a great deal of thought and care has gone in to the preparation of all of the 7 various dishes that were served to each of us. The carrot dish that is served as part of the first starter is excellent, perhaps because it reminded me of eating salmon, it doesn't matter, the food here is seriously good and I did not miss the fact that there was no meat for even a second!Our waitress, Christie was also very attentive and she looked after us well.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.The restaurant has a very strange feel to it. From the the big white industrial sized air conditioning unit standing close to our table to the black and grey wallpaper and the black lampshades with no lights on along with the black tiled floor, Joie feels more like a retail outlet than an actual restaurant. Diners sit awkwardly across the expanse of shop floor that separates them from one another, this confusing visual experience just doesn't match the quality of the food at all.The wine cellar was almost empty, there were literally two different bottles of red available to guests on Saturday night. We didn't expect this and nobody really seemed to have an answer, far from ideal given we were celebrating a friend's birthday.Lastly, the menu needs a some copy writing attention, the use of the word 'platter' is not only repetitive but also entirely misleading and titles such as 'transparency of pear' are clearly odd (no pun intended).So great job to the team in the kitchen and the front of house but to the brains behind the interior design and the manager of the wine cellar, please have a think about what your guests actually want before they walk through your darkened doors
5
Located at the heart of Orchard Road with the perfect ambience of the root top garden, Joie is the perfect restaurant for fine dining. Having a meal there is like attending an art appreciation class or going to an art gallery. The food is tastefully done and marvellous, a luxury to feast the eyes
5
Great atmosphere, very friendly and nice staff and delicious food! Value for money is extremely good and we are impressed and soon back, next time with friends. My husband is not a vegetarian but he didn't miss meat at all. Great experience and highly recommendable! Thanks and see you soon :-
5
I have been here a couple of times with friends and on both occasions been impressed with the food and the service. The dishes are beautifully presented. There is enough choice in the set menu to choose different items for each visit. Do plan on spending 2 hours for a relaxed enjoyable meal (that said on our second visit we were short of time and called in advance to say that we needed the dishes brought out in quick succession and the staff obliged wonderfully). Ask for one of the smaller rooms for a cosy atmosphere with views of the garden outside
5
Celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary. No one would believe that vegetarian food can be so good both how it was presented as well as how delicious it was.
Definitely a place that I will go again as service is first class!
4
Was here on Monday as soon as we landed in Singapore. Forgets to make reservation but the waiter find us a seat. Service is good and the staff make you feel so welcome. Singapore hospitality! Loved the chocolate mousse😋
4
We went here for our anniversary and had a really good time. It's a fixed menu and all vegetarian and it's very different type of food. The location is excellent too- on the rooftop. If you book in advance and are 4 or more book a room. Service is very good- though the food kept coming a little faster than we would have liked. But overall- a superb experience 
5
Located inside the Orchard Central, this restaurant is definitely a heaven for vegetarians. This was our first meatless dining experience and it has really shaken our perception on vegetarian menu. We had a 7 course degustation menu, which was both interesting and delicious. The dishes were influenced by french techniques, japanese ingredients, italian pastas and molecular cuisine. Now when the chefs combined all of these, they gave us a piece of art on the plate, including golden paint (edible) that completely astonished us. All of the dishes we tried were light and delicate and even after 3 hours dining, we had a great feeling of satiety without feeling heavy.
5
We were celebrating a promotion and the stuff was kind enough to get us a pdr.We had the six course lunch for 38++ and it was the most fantastic culinary experience with excellent service i ever had in Singapore. Totally worth it or even double i would say! If you are a vegetarian its a must! Thank you Joie x
5
On our last nigh in Singapour after 2 years living here we found Joie by Dozo. Great experience as the food is very original in the positive way which I would call Modern Fusion. The presentation of every dish is amazing with attention to details. The service is very attentive and friendly. They made something special for us that night so that we enjoy our last dinner in Singapore even if this was our first visit. Finally they have quieter areas for couples wishing to have a romantic dinner. So we will come back on our next visit to Singapore definitely. Great place for Vegetarians too
5
A visual feast of culinary delight. The taste burst with excitement. Imagine vegetarian escargot. Highly recommended for all to try. I am a meat eater but Joie won my heart. The dedication of the chef is highly commendable. Sincerely hope that many will have the opportunity to taste this wonderful gem in Singapor
5
First time there as an all girls' night. Was given a private room even though there's only 4 of us which is for 6 pax.Service was really detailed and maybe due to it's a Monday too thus not so crowded and we got all the attention. Staff was very helpful and explained in details on the dishes we ordered. Didn't expect that the food and presentation of vegetarian food can be like normal french dining.Food was excellent and all of us was totally of good words for it and don't be surprised that the 7-course dinner though portion not that big but it can really be filling. However am slightly disappointed with the liquid chocolate dessert. Was told it's dark chocolate mousse but the percentage of the dark chocolate is not very high as it's not bitter at all to me (maybe coz I'm a dark chocolate lover) but overall it's good.Maybe lots of people will find that it's slightly expensive for vegetarian food but I think with the ambience, service together with the presentation and taste of the food, I think this price is quite worth the price coz each dish cost average about max $12nett.Definitely a great place for get-together, chill-out with friends as well as some celebration if there's a requirement
5
my experience was great and memorable. Food is good, an original presentation of dishes and a very nice warm atmosphere.We had a lunch in a private area...this added a lot to our experience. The staff are friendly and professional.Thank you. I will come back for sur
5
This was my second visit - this time for dinner with the friends (the last time was for lunch). It's a set menu, but for each course, you get to choose between 3-4 options. Serving sizes per course are small to just-right. The presentation is unique, and the explanation of the food (and how to eat it), makes the whole experience a journey of discovery and anticipation. Between us, we tried almost all the options, and came away liking all the dishes, so I don't have a specific dish to recommend. Go with the flow, and enjoy the experience
5
Had an enjoyable dining experience with good quality food decorated in an appetizing way and food is very nice and eye catching. Talented chef and staff. Will come back for further service and food experience next time. Thanks.

Food quality and portion vary. last visit was served with cold mushroom soup, half warm risotto and few of my guests fell sick after that. Had dine in different private dinning room and each room temperature is freezing cold.

Joie by Dozo is situated at the top of Orchard Central. One would not go there unless you were going to the restaurant, so it was a pleasant surprise to see Orchard Road from a high vantage point. Despite going in the day, the restaurant looked dark on the inside, probably because it was mostly black in colour. Perhaps the lighting would be better in the night, when the surroundings were also dark. The restaurant only offers a set menu, 6 courses for lunch and 7 courses for dinner. It is very well-priced. Maybe because it is a vegetarian restaurant.The food was delicious and all nicely plated, like a fine dining restaurant. Despite it being a vegetarian restaurant, a lot of the dishes were infused with flavour and ingredients chosen to mimic meat, without using the traditional chinese gluten option.Overall, it was a great experience. Never really thought that I was having vegetarian food because the food was so flavourful. Definitely one of the better vegetarian restaurants in Singapore
4
We came for dinner and we got a private room (but we had not asked for it). The views and garden are best enjoyed during the day. At first all the black shiny decor was a bit kitch - and it is - but ends up working well with the setting of the dishes.We got the 7 course menu and I requested mine to be dairy free. This place is suitable for vegans.The highlights were:- The dragon fruit salad starter- The vegan sashimi plater- The mushroom steak on a hot stone (that left my carnivore friend very happy)- The desert "garden" with red bean pasteWe all ordered different dishes - but more asian style - there is also a more italian version of the menu with risottos and truffles.The italian pinot Grigio was also fabulous, dry and crispy to go with the meal, but my heart still cringes with all the prices in Singapore (its not about this place, its all the places). This was one of the cheapest bottles and was about 70â‚¬... Its all too crazy and for a good decent meal in Singapore we pay what we pay for a Michelin stared restaurant in Europe. So... value for money still an issue for me in this country.Service was outstanding too. Thank you for the very nice evening
4
We visited this restaurant on a Saturday for lunch. We ordered the set lunch which had 5 or 6 courses to choose from. And in every course, there were a few choices. More than 100 combinations. The food was well presented in an artistic style. The service was good too
5
Joie by Dozo was way above and beyond my expectations, in presentation, choice of food, taste and ingredients.It's a tasting menu with just the perfect quantity. My husband and I truly enjoyed every moment of it. I felt fortunate being pampered with the best beautiful and most creative Japanese vegan meal
5
The restaurant is at the roof top of a building in Orchard and you can get a great view depending on the desk they give you. Desks are available inside and outside the saloon.There is a set menu you can choose from and all the options were creative mixing different flavours and reaching amazing textures, like a "salmon"made with carrot and a perfect salmon consistency.There are a few vegetarian good contemporary restaurants and this is one of them
5
Very nice vegetarian food. Presentation was fantastic. The taste and texture is awesome. Friendly staff ... the waiter explains each dish and even suggests the sequence it is eaten (for maximum flavour). We were pleasantly surprised to get a small anniversary cake at the end of our 7 course dinner. Awesome experience ..
5
Technically Joie is not a vegetarian restaurant but a meatless restaurant. In reality it is 95% veggies, so if you are a pure vegetarian, they will make small adjustments. It is a truly unexpected treat.I have never seen a veggie based restaurant that presents the food as artfully, creative & original as Joie. The cuisine is somewhere between Europe and Japan, so everything is light and mildly spiced. The use of mushrooms & truffle certainly is among the things they do the best, as well as the interplay between textures. And, because they are leaving meat, which usually is driven prices up considerably, it is actually a good deal on top of the great food
5
We had a small reunion at Joie restaurant. My friends recommend this place because of its good and healthy foods. And, the restaurant was situated at this roof garden at Orchard Central. The view was really relaxing. The food was great and the server was so attentive and friendly as well.It was a great night for all of us and we will be coming back
5
I really enjoy and love the awesome innovative vegetarian food using nature fare and also the serene roof top garden with an temporary chic ambience!
Thumbs up!
5
We were there for the Valentines Day 7-course dinner to the tune of $279.
Food was interesting and beautiful.
Certainly appropriate for those not in a rush.
5
Was pleasantly surprised by the menu which are all meatless and attentive service from the staff. The food were delicious and price is reasonable for 7 course dinner.
5
A gem in Singapore city centre fora fine dining experience for vegans and vegetarians. Lovely ambience, good range of menu selection and great customer service. Highly recommended!
2
It's nice but definitely not a high end classy restaurant. Food is mediocre at best but presentation and serving plates are nice. The after meal drink are served in stylish serving ware but the mixed fruit juice feels like coming out of a Del Monte can.Very poor value !Overall a disappointing experience
4
Had birthday celebration lunch with a group of mostly non vegetarians. We tried to order different dishes from our set menus and we were pleasantly surprised that all dishes were beautifully crafted and created! Display was awesome and the food tasted great too despite being meatless! The service crew was attentive and took the effort to explain the ingredients used for the dishes, how they are prepared and presented etc. Will definitely be back again!
5
It is the first time in my life that I eat vegetarian cooking Amazing discovery : an explosion of savours The personal perfect and a price at this level totally correct If we come back in Singapore we will go there to remember that there is another way of lifestyle... Do not hesitate one second it is top
4
While the food as such was great, the fact that the service standards did not quite match up, was a disappointment. As a group of seven on an extremely windy and rainy day, we were allotted an outdoor table. Upon requesting for a change (one would expect that the restaurant would notice on its own) it took over 45 minutes for us (a long wait) until we got our table. Meanwhile, until asked we were also not offered seats to sit and we had a toddler in our group getting incredibly restless
5
Had set lunch here with my wife and I must say this is the best meatless restaurant we have ever been to! Enjoyed every course from the start till the end! The appetitiser was amazingly flavourful! Main course of grilled mushroom came like an art piece and yet so tasty! Desert of the creme Brule was amazing with the truffle infusion! Thank you for the cake dessert to celebrate our Valentine's day!
4
At first I was really not excited about going to a vegetarian restaurant. But I have to confess that I was really delighted with the quality of the food proposed. Everything seemed very good and tasty, the presentation is amazing, and the service very efficient.A nice experience 
5
Perfect for non meat lovers. Taste delicious and food is deliciously crafted. But price is on the high side.
5
Presentation: The food is very 'different' and original. The restaurant takes a lot of care in the way they present their food. Taste: The food tastes great and there's many different flavours and textures. Atmosphere: The view is great and there's a nice pond outside as well. Great for a night dining experience. Bathrooms: This isn't operated by Joie but the ones on the 12th floor needed a refurb.Price: This isn't an everyday spot. You're spending about SGD $75 per head. But don't forget this is 7 courses including drinks and dessert. There are however alternatives like Elemen in Millenia Walk that are cheaper and probably quite close in food standard. The one thing that sets Joie apart is the service. They are fantastic. They serve so elegantly and they're very polite taking it step up by explaining the dishes to you etc. A great experience overall. Highly recommended
4
As a carnivore who enjoys straying into vegetarian (even vegan) territory often, I was amazed at the quality, taste and presentation of our food. See details about dishes in other people's reviews, please. I think nearly anybody would feel more than satisfied after consuming the 7-course menu, even a meat-eater. Just delicious and so well presented. Amusingly, each plate comes with instructions by the waiter on how to eat it properly.Only downside is how cold the inside temperature was. Even if that is typical of many Asian higher-class establishments, the air was downright cold. Not quite Russian vodka freezer but wear a cardigan
5
The place will blow you right out of the water with its sheer creativity, style, presentation and taste of the food it serves.We went with the 6 course meal and every single course was uniquely prepared, served in a most pleasing manner with the steward telling you about the dish you are about to 'experience'. And an experience it is! I thought they used a bit too much truffle in the menu but I am not really complaining as I love truffle.The part that really makes you sit up and take notice at this gem is that it is entirely meat-free (or what can be called pure vegetarian). They even have an egg free menu for the really staunch diners.A few pictures of what I had. I won't bother with details. Suffice to say that this place deserves a standing ovation
4
Being a vegetarian this restaurant has been on my list for a long time. Very interesting textures and presentation was great! They used carrot to look like salmon for the sashimi. It was yummy food and great service. I wish they could just work a bit on the ambience to make it special.
5
I researched before leaving for Singapore to find a high quality vegetarian restaurant to go to for my birthday. Sadly top class quality vegetarian restaurants for that special meal tend to be lacking.Well Joie was AWESOME!!! OMG I cannot tell you how much we enjoyed this meal, it was just so good and the setting so wonderful. I am vegetarian but my Dad isn't and he was also blown away by the flavours. We went for lunch which is a 5 course affair and my what an experience it is! The staff explain the food to you and you have an awesome drinks to go with it as part of the package.We had a starter, main, side, soup and a wonderful exotic drink. All the food was wonderful and a great experience - very sad that Joie is not in my city so I can become a regular!For my birthday they brought out a wonderful cake which was an unexpected and fantastic touch. When I am in Singapore again I am DEFINITELY going to Joie
5
Joie is a restaurant worth giving a try. Servers are very attentive.. 5 of us came for a 6 courses lunch at only $38++ each.. that is definitely worth it for the services given, food served and the nice ambient. We enjoyed every bit of the course served
4
lunch with 12 friends of various persuasians from extreme vegetarians to carnivores. A taster menu of eight courses with a choice of one from at least 3. The menu was based on Japanese cuisine with a few Western European elements such as the creme brulee for dessert, pesto in the sauces etc. Each course was well balanced and led nicely onto the next. if I have a bone to grind then it has to be the lack of description of the various dishes. This meant you could not make a choice based on a bit of information on the dish. The staff were great and stayed in close proximity in the background and quick to respond to any movemt on any ones part to attract attention. I highly recommend this eateri
5
There was eleven of us so we were put in a separate room. Special menu cos it was xmas meal. Interesting blend of Japanese vegetarian food. Reasonable value when you consider 7 courses. The food was well explained by the waiting staff. Would love to come bac
5
If you're like me, "vegetarian" means 'feel healthy' and 'boring' and like something you probably ought to do every now and then, but this is a beautiful and chic place perfect for lunching among ladies. Delicious food, beautifully prepared and with complex flavors. If it didn't advertise as vegetarian you wouldn't know it was
5
What a surprise when we visited this vegetarian restaurant. I expected it to be boring but I was totally flabbergasted! Creativity, ambiance, warm welcome, very professional staff. An unforgettable experience.
5
If you've never experienced Joie, book a table now. Perfect ambiance for a romantic evening and the food is simply to die for. Even if you're not a vegetarian!
5
Joie by Dozo is a revelation in vegetarian fine dining. It is not the easiest of places to find but well worth it once you get there! I've been there a few times & have loved it each time. The staff are friendly & well informed about the components of each dish. The dinner menu is a set 7 course meal (as opposed to lunch which is a set 6 course meal). The portions are well thought of in terms of size & execution. The plating of the dishes is awe-inspiring & the food is every bit as delicious as it looks. There are sufficient choices in each course to appeal to everyone. I love the gratinated champignons with mozzarella. It's such a moorish dish with generous portions of stringy, melted mozzarella. My other favourite is the Duo Ravioli Platter. The pasta is al dente & the filling of spinach & pumpkin is delicious. My friends & I tried different items on the menu & all of us left happy & impressed. This restaurant is unpretentious but manages to deliver vegetarian fusion cuisine to incredibly high standards. My only criticism of the evening was that the air conditioning was too cold especially in the private rooms so dress warmly when you go there. This restaurant is a family favourite & we love the food
4
Joie is one of those places that is the result of someone's vision and mission but where the execution is left miles behind. It oozes creativity abut lacks class in spite of pricing that is overboard and totally unjustified. While the food itself is sublime, the presentation very subtle and creative, there are many things wrong with this place. First, the location on the top floor of this shopping center is totally inconspicuous and that was reflected in the near empty restaurant on a Friday night in the busy holiday season. Second, there has been no attention paid to the décor and the lighting. Black may be 'in' but it requires a good artist to paly with it. The result here is totally depressing. Also, even though we had a table by the window, there was no view of any kind, something to do with the kind of windows in place. Third, like all establishments and public transport in Singapore, the place blasts arctic air making it very uncomfortable to sit and enjoy the meal. Lastly, by not offering a la carte, they are short changing themselves. While I sincerely wish them the best, I doubt if this place will survive for long. The execution is all wrong
3
Went there to try the special veggie menus and was really curious after all the magnificent pictures everywhere. So first of all, you cannot eat à la carte, there is only one set menu everybody has to eat (you can choose from several options with each course). For our dinner it was a 7-set menu. Positive is the way the food is presented, it's almost like in a Michelin star restaurant. The taste is also relatively OK, but some of the combinations left our stomachs in a bad shape afterwards, maybe one of the ingredients was not good... Also positive is the staff, very helpful. But still a bit strange if you have 7 people walking around for only four tables. Negative is the very sad interior, so black it's kind of depressing. That alone is a reason I would never go again, it's really not cosy at all. It was also much too cold, I really don't understand why some restaurant owners don't understand this. It was freezing, we actually changed tables. Still, overall it was a nice try, the dishes are certainly well presented and some taste fine, but I don't think you can survive if there are four tables on a Friday evening and at such a prime location on Orchard Rd. Also the interior is not suited for a profitable long life I'm afraid, people will not want to come back here. Oh, before I forget: no meat, no fish, only pure set-menu vegetarian style
4
This is not some place I would take young kids, but it is lovely for a "date-night" or adults only dinner. The service is beautiful, though the servers are a little difficult to understand. This place proves Veg/Vegan food can be elegant, tasty and a fantastic experience. Every course was presented artfully. Tastes are subtle and mild. I guess it's what you call a "dining experience" rather than just eating out. And the view is bar none

We were patrons on the older dozo business and was excited to book for Josie expecting same for a family birthday. Missed the all veg deal in the research however the presentation and taste was excellent. One point - why is the air con on wind chill minus 10 degrees - it is colder than the movie theaters and that takes some doing. Staff were a bit overeager to push us through the courses and had to ask them to slow down.. overall a special experience - kid number two's comment 'it's like we are watching Heston in action'.. great complement to the team

We very much enjoyed this meal. A fixed seven-course meal for dinner. Although vegetarian this restaurant layed on an excellent vegan version for us. My favourite was the mushroom and truffle soup and my husband loved the sushimi-style entree best. Some of the smaller courses were a little too sweet for our taste. The view was lovely, though a little hard to see at night - dimmer restaurant lighting and a little outdoor lighting would have added to the ambience; that being said we were very happy with everything and extremely touched by the plate that was brought out that said "Welcome to Singapore". Lovely and very helpful staff

I was actually speechless and totally impressed.By the classy atmosphere/ambiance - n there of us were so generously escorted to a private room.By the outstanding service and excellent staffs, who tried to make us as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Who were patient and talented with what they were doing.By the fantastic vegetarian dishes. I never got such an explossion by vegetarian courses. They were so playfull and yummy. The look? Just WOW
5
A rather new kind of vegetarian cuisine in Singapore and I particularly like the type and kind of service that the staff offer. If you are unsure of the type of food that's suitable for you, they are ready to help. If you have a special occasion, they are ready to help.We went there twice, with August 2016 being the second time, and they have not only maintained the kind of personalized service, but even improved on it making order your meals a breeze

We were celebrating Raksha bandhan.. A day specially for brother and sister... So my brother and his wife decided to treat me to this place.. We booked the private dinning area with the garden setting view... For lunch they have a 6 course menu... What food and presentation.. From the starter till desserts every course was yummy. Worth a visit on special occasion...Also best part is that it's an 100% vegetarian restaurant

Joie by dozo was one of my great fine dining experience. It was our family gathering when my whole family dine at Joie by Dozo restaurant at the Roof Garden of Orchard Central.It was a lovely evening for all of us, we enjoy the food with its unique presentation. The price was reasonable for its 7 course set meal. The kids also enjoyed themselves and they liked the food and the ambience in the restaurant. This place was a perfect venue for family gathering and other special occasions. There service was really good.It was a lovely evening for all of us.Thank you Joie for this great experience and we will definitely come back for more of your delicious food and excellent service :

Four of us went to Joie for my husband's birthday dinner. The decor is very tacky and the place has a run down appearance with dull, dirty tables and peeling wallpaper. The restaurant is only 2 years old.The servers are not the kind you would expect at a fine dining restaurant - they were ill informed and explained the dishes in a manner/accent that was quite hard to understand. The menu itself was presented on a badly printed sheet of paper.The dishes were mediocre to bad with the mushroom gratin smothered in cheese, lackluster risotto and cough syrup-like drinks.The courses were very rushed with servers hovering around constantly to see if we had finished. On a Saturday night they brought us our bill at 10pm(without us asking for it!) saying they had to close the till. Nobody asked if we would like coffee. So much for fine dining!We paid $360.I will not be going to Joie by Dozo again

Overall I thought the food was really high quality. It's nice to have a more upmarket vegetarian option for a special meal, but at $80 for 7 courses it's also reasonably priced - that's without wine though.The setting is lovely - tables beside the window have a really nice view. The staff were very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. The food was all really interesting and varied - I particularly enjoyed the sashimi and the tempura. A few negatives - for 7 courses it was over pretty quickly. Each dish arrived shortly after the other and we were finished in around 75 mins. It was an early booking so perhaps they had a 2nd sitting, but I would have rather savoured each a little longer. Also, the lack of vegan desserts was very disappointing. Other than that it catered very well to vegans, there's really no excuse for only being able to provide some fruit for dessert, given how inventive lots of the dishes are

This place is a visual and culinary delight!!! As a vegetarian I often struggle with choices esp for fine dining until I found Joie! They offer a 5/6 course menu with plenty of selection. Great if u r going in s group then you can order one of each dish and share! They even offer small plates for sharing. The presentation, the taste and service everything is fabulous! Even their drinks are superb! Been there a couple of times and it has never failed to impress. Great value for lunch time meal. And do let them know in advance if you are celebrating an occasion. Highly recommended!!

This restaurant was selected as they served vegatrian/vegan food. It was delighted to see the nice presentation of food serving including the dessert and choice of drink. I was not impressed by the "beef" that was mushroom served in Pu Ye. Doesn't like the herb and spicy taste of mushroom. Overall food was quite good including dessert and drinks.

I was hosted in a fancy living room; trekked in a beautiful park; lay on a Caribbean beach; was digging, looking for hidden treasures; sailed to Antarctica; walked around a beautiful pool; participated in a traditional ceremony with an African tribe; picked flowers in a beautiful field; and tasted the forbidden fruit - all of this had happened during one amazing 7-course dinner in a vegetarian restaurant. It was definitely one of the best meals I've ever had and one that I'll treasure for a long, long time.This restaurant is absolutely fabulous, and if you're a food-for-though kind of a person - you'll love it! Every dish tells a different story, and these stories are fascinating and beautiful. The dishes are colorful, well-designed, and have lots of different flavors. You even get eating instructions from the chef (start with this part of the dish, then take that part and dip it in that sauce, etc.). All of it is reasonably prices (a 7-course-plus dinner for less that 70S$).In addition to the food, the restaurant is beautifully located on the 12th floor roof garden of Orchard Central, so don't miss a walk around it, observing the wonderful city of Singapore from above

I must admit I booked my husband and I for dinner at Joie to celebrate Father's Day on a whim. Not that I have anything against vegetarian/vegan food, but it's not really top of mind for us when thinking about food or where to eat. But I wanted to find out for myself how they can create dishes so wonderful to the taste without even a speck of meat or fish. And I have to say, Joie delivered on this promise - and on point. We ordered the 7-course dinner and everything (literally everything!) from the starter down to the dessert and the free brownie at the end of the meal (because Father's Day!) was a gastronomic treat. I love my cold sashimi platter and the ravioli! My pumpkin soup was delicious and so was the crème brulée. Another thing that really stood out was the attentiveness of the staff. They take time to explain the ingredients and way the dishes were prepared. Very informative! And of course, the location itself is quite special. It doesn't give you killer views like MBS or The Altitude Bar does, but I think the little canal on the side with some lotus plants afloat add a happy touch to the whole ambience. Love it here

Best meal during my 4-day trip. If you’re a vegetarian, you definitely need to eat at Joie by Dozo. If you’re a meat eater like myself (more of a flexitarian) but enjoy and appreciate vegetarian cuisine, you’ll also enjoy Joie. It’s definitely on the pricier side, but go during lunch for the best value, as you get the same selection as dinner, except for the cold starter, for almost half the price. Service was good and quick. Each dish was brought out swiftly just as the last one was finished. (I could’ve used a little breathing room in between, though, to air out my belly.) The servers also explained each dish as they were brought out and answered any questions we had. We were also seated by the window in their sunroom. We got a nice view of the Singapore vista from high up, but also of their goldfish pond that runs alongside the outside garden/patio area. Standouts include the gratinated champignon with mozzarella appetizer, soups (pumpkin and cepes & truffle), bai ling mushroom steak entrée, and dessert (and fruit tea). The gratinated champignon is served in an escargot platter, with a button mushroom placed inside each slot instead of snails and fresh mozzarella layered on top and cooked to a nice browness (would pair perfectly with wine). I’m a bit of a soup snob, but I found their soups to be very fragrant. You get a nice hit of truffle in the cepes & truffle soup, and the pumpkin, though not thick, is a nice smooth, rich consistency. And the best dish yet was the bai ling mushroom steak served on a hot stone. I’ve actually had something very similar before in Taiwan at a place called Yu Shan Ge, but the presentation here and the way they plated it on the hot stone so you get a nice hard crispness (think a nice sear on a steak) on the outside was more to my liking. Wish it came with more sauce, but it’s still an A+ in my book. Their desserts were also a nice finish. The lavender tea, which was straight lavender, was a nice palate cleanser but could’ve been served hotter (served lukewarm). The warm chocolate cake was nothing special but still tasty. The truffle crème brulee was different. Heavily laced with truffle, you’ll either love it or hate it, as it’s a very specialized dessert. Their chilled fruit tea was also a nice finisher with its lavender color and robust fruitiness. Not everything was a slam dunk, though. What I would pass on would be the tempura platter on mash and truffle risotto—both fell flat on taste. The tempura was a charcoal batter, so the black color was unappetizing, and it wasn’t crispy and was under-seasoned. They used vegetables that all had the same consistency—a bit mushy—and was hard to discern what was what. As for the risotto—unlike the soup and dessert, the truffle flavor fell short and it was also under-seasoned. I would advise calling or booking ahead. They weren’t overly busy the Friday afternoon we went, but we since we loved it so much, we returned that Sunday again before leaving, only to find they closed the entire restaurant for a private celebration (it’s shocking they’d close on a weekend).Ultimately, down to its quality, presentation and taste, it’s one of the best-tasting vegetarian restaurants that I’ve been to—and I’ve been to a lot. Each dish has an elevated sophistication to it that few other vegetarian restaurants worldwide are currently doing, because, usually, “fine dining” and “all-vegetarian” rarely go hand in hand—though it should. And between the starters, refreshers (passion fruit granita)/snacks (fried noodles) and entree, one thing’s for sure—you will not walk away hungry nor disappointed

Yet another pure vegetarian restaurant that has been on my to do list forever..We were there to celebrate a friends birthday; a bunch of ladies taking time out to do a long lunch. The atmosphere is beautiful; we were seated in a private dining room at the restaurant. The service was amazing; they explained the menu and some of the courses well. The presentation was gorgeous; really worth going to see it!However; the food was absolutely dismal! The tastes were bland; the wild rice for instance was absolutely devoid of any flavours; the duo ravioli was too milky and not really Italian in flavour. Only the tofu in green curry emulsion was great and the warm chocolate was nice too.A 6 course meal costs about 36.80$. And they have a 20% promotion on this price on UOB cards currently. So the pricing is great; wish they could reduce portions and courses to create more delectable tastes
5
I'm coming back to Singapore just to eat here again! I had the 6 course lunch and sat outside. Great view, fantastic food!
4
the food was good. and well presented - kind of like a molecular gastronomy type. The different styles of presentation of the food and drinks is very inviting. wetried the various options available in the 6 course meal, and liked the aubergine main course. I was not a big fan of the chunky mushroom on a hot stone though. The overuse of trufle in some foods was not particularly liked - especially the crÃ¨me brulee. Desserts should remain that - desserts.... negatives - the table we sat at - was wobbling... and not expected of a fine dining restaurant. And I thought it was noisier than shold have been - but maybe it was because of the Sunday crowd. The restaurant should have been less stingy while serving their complimentary brownie cake to the birthday girl!!

My niece picked Joie to celebrate her 21st birthday as a surprise for the whole family. Perched on the 12th floor roof garden of Orchard Central, this restaurant turned out to be a good choice. Dinner was a 7 course affair with 4 or 5 selections for each category. Standouts were the trio of amuse bouche that began the meal - seaweed crackers with wasabi cream, a carrot gel that imitated salmon & a raspberry sphere that smacks of molecular gastronomy. I'd recommend the gratinated mushrooms baked with mozzarella, the tempura coated with charcoal ash on a bed of truffle mash, the ravioli filled with pumpkin & spinach in a creamy foam, the mushroom steak that was fully of meaty flavors. The cepe infusion as well as pumpkin veloute were also a hit. For dessert you can go wrong with red wine poached pear, truffle infused creme brÃ»lÃ©e as well as liquid chocolate. The misses were the vegetable tartare as well as the truffle risotto which was cooked too dry & not creamy enough. Service was warm & friendly as the staff clearly took pride in their work. Prices were very affordable for the set menu. My gripe is not with the restaurant itself but Orchard Central which is such a horribly designed building. Finding our car was a nightmare compounded by the labyrinthine layout of the building. Really scary and a shame as Joie deserves many more diners than at present. Do give this restaurant your support.

Have you had sushi that tastes like salmon, but you know it's vegetarian? This place is like a mind riddle - incredible with it's tastes, textures and smells. It's all vegetarian, which makes it even healthier. My meat loving self and meat loving boyfriend still walked away incredibly delighted at the meal - it's pricey, but totally worth it. A big thumbs up for a great experience
5
No more terrible mock meat dishes, curry vegetarian or salads - this is a fine dining-like (except for the affordable prices), heathy vegetarian option. Venue is phenomenal with good views is Orchard Road. Set menu be it the 6 or 7 courses extremely affordable. Food is out of the world. First dish was the three set appetizer and the carrot was like real salmon sashimi. The the main course is like a grilled meat - various types So my choice was the hot stone mushroom "meatloaf" with black pepper sauce. My friend's was like a grilled pork. They had a lot of courses of drinks but I guess it's okay because I was so full I didn't want dessert. Highly recommended for a romantic night out or a business lunch. You wouldn't even notice that it is vegetarian.

We were delightfully impressed by the excellent service and the food presentation. As it was our first time dining at Joie, our server gave us very helpful suggestions. The only downside was that almost everything on the menu had mushrooms in them. I do hope by our next visit, there will be a few more options to choose from.
5
It was actually my first time to dine at Joie by Dozo and I find their dishes delectable. The main course Summer Mushroom was exquisite. I also loved their new dishes Root vegetable garden and bailing mushroom on paper hot pot. Well, the Joie Liquid Chocolate was fantastic. I'll definitely return to taste their Japanese Kunbu Broth with Chrysanthemum Tofu. More so, their service was excellent and the ambiance was remarkable. Loved it
5
It was a great experience we had when we dine in at Joie by Dozo. The food was delicious and the presentation was unique. The service was really good. The server were attentive to all our needs. It was a great night for us. And, we will definitely come back at Joie

We went for a valentines dinner. Compared to other artisanal fine dining, this is cheaper. We ate none meat food. I think they used all kind of mushrooms in our food and tastes ok but not that surprising. Restaurant itself is ok,but we waited quite long for our batch to start dining. Nice presentation in the food
1
Services was really bad. Asked for a drink 3 times. Asked for the bill 3 times. Noisy kitchen. You can hear all the smashing around. Lighting wasn't one bit romantic for Valentine's Day or even a fine dining experience. I felt like I was in an office with those bring lights. The place kinda looks run down too. No music too. Very bad feeling in there. Food came out cold. Soup was even cold!!! I felt like it was all a big rush job. Come in, sit down and get out. But.... I must say. Food was well above average. Pity for such amazing food has turned me off going back there because of the bad service and ambience.
5
sonething of difference... and good...really good.
evrrything was perfect..really nice also the location.
here it's temple of good food.
try to believe.
100$ each is the price for this pray.
vegetable sushi, mushroom steak and more and more thing to try..

I am someone who love meat and was a bit concerned about eating at a meatless restaurant. I was extremely surprised by the variety and quality of food offered by Joie. The lunch was definitely value for money. Each dish is very well decorated and flavored. Even though it's a fine dining place, we were very full. P.s: Tell them if you are celebrating a birthday and you will receive a piece of cake.Ask for the private room with garden view
4
There is a great lunch set at under S$40 per person. For this - you get 2 non-alcoholic drinks/tea, starter, soup, main and dessert plus amuse bouche.The location is great, ambience is great as tables are not too tightly packed together. Attentive staff.Food is great to tasty, and drinks and dishes are creatively and beautifully presented. You should leave feeling satiated and in a good mood, you will "feel good" that you went vegetarian and did not overpay for an Orchard Road rooftop dining experience
5
When one wants to see creativity in cuisine, non-meat (vegetarian), one must go for dinner at Joie Restaurant. A true dedicated effort by staff to demonstrate that food coming from love and made with love is a blessing for the body and the mind. It shows that enjoying dinner does not need to be based on 'killing' of a living being. It shows what a healthy and joyful life-style can be. Go. Don't wait
5
This restaurant is one of the best restaurants I have been eating in. I asked for an outside table and the view was fantastic. The food was so appealing as it was presented with nice plates and original presentation. Useless to say that the food itself was excellent and diversified. This was the first time in my life I had such great vegetarian meal. Thank you to the chef and the service
4
My second visit to Joie and I'm suitably impressed. The ambience is great, the service applaud worthy and the food delicious. I've tried both the 6-course set and the 7-course. I would recommend going with the former for first timers, especially since the latter is significantly more expensive - about $20-$30 more depending on the occasion.
5
I was visiting my sister in Singapore for New Years' . Since we are all vegetarians she had suggested we eat once at this very "different" Japanese style restaurant. Time flew by and it was finally our last day there. Somehow we managed to squeeze in a lunch at this restaurant. All the dishes were very creatively presented and they also tasted wonderful. I must say that I've never eaten food like this before. I would recommend this place top anyone who's looking for an amazing meal
5
If you want to experience fantastic vegetarian fine dining, with privacy, great service and lovely food in Singapore, this is the place to go to. Simply fabulous! Set meals at reasonable prices. And they pamper you with constant flow of herbal teas that make you feel you are on a permanent holiday! I took my friends for my birthday. Since I had mentioned it on making the reservation, they had a small brownie cake with candles, making the whole experience even more special! Must go place!!
5
We came here for dinner, Ambience is alright of the restaurant, not very great for the price that we are paying. Should be improved. Price was $160ish for a couple dinner. Food came as a 7 course meal. Service was very attentive to when we finished the meal, next course would come within few minutes, so thumbs up for that.Food is amazing! We didn't expect it to be this good but every course of the meal was greatly enjoyed. Highlights are the some warm cake like appetizers, risotto, pumpkin soup, cheesecake. Very costly thou, so would only come back after some time. No ala carte menu, so hope they introduce new options yearly. Definitely worth the experience
1
Quite how there are so many positive reviews of this place are beyond me. The service started off with a couple of waiters setting our table very noisily, crashing the cutlery around which was unfortunately the start of some of the worse service I have ever encountered. Waiters were mumbling when asking questions, asking to take away dishes which we were still working on. After asking for them to slow down repeatedly, we got to the end of our meal and at 11pm (on a Friday!) a member of staff not seen before (not a waiter) comes out and says "we're closing now."We still had a full glass of wine left each. We responded with "ok"The guy then stays around our table staring menacingly at us to unceremoniously kick us out!Truly terrible service which left us feeling angry and really disappointed. Was a date on a Friday night afterall! Quite how this place survives is beyond me. I would give zero stars if I could.
5
Excellent, high-end vegetarian, serving a selection of courses from an extensive set menu. The food was of the highest quality, very well presented and great service by knowledgeable and friendly staff. Definitely worth another visit!
5
Visited Joie for the first time & loved it!! Definitely something to try, even a member of our party who wasn't impressed at the thought of going enjoyed the food!Food was delicious, staff very attentive & obliging!!Very enjoyable experience & definitely a "must try"place, will be taking our future visitors to Singapore there to try it!!
5
This restaurant is situated in the midst of Orchard Road and its interior is exquisitely decorated. The ambience is quiet and peaceful. We were given a warm welcome and the staff then goes on to explain the menu. We had a delicious array of dishes. A vase of decor on the table turns out to be an edible cracker... so creative.My friend was coughing incessantly and the waiter then served her a complimentary pot of herbal tea. It's a small gesture but we were deeply impressed with the attentive staff.Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner where we were treated to the superb culinary talents and creativity of the chef
5
This place is a hidden gem, an absolute jewel. Great and creative dishes and a high class atmosphere. The staff is attentive and the wine tastes good. Michelin should visit this place. It's difficult to find, as it is in the same building as a mall, but once you arrive, you forget that immediately. They also have a few tables outside on the terrace with a nice view over Singapore
4
Fantastic vegetarian food really well presented. The service is excellent. The starters won the day for me and the signature mushroom dish on the hot slab lost it. The mushroom was under seasoned with hot oil spitting out from the dish. The mushroom actually burnt. Desserts were eat. The wine list is good with a selection of reasonably priced wines

Met a friend for lunch at this well reviewed and supposedly unique vegetarian restaurant atop one of the skyscrapers in downtown Orchard, Singapore.As in all my food reviews, I always feel atmosphere needs to be paired with well presented, quality and good tasting food. AtmosphereLove the ambience of the place, tables are well space, nice settings, and a plus point as they take into account dietary requirements for customers. I enjoyed the fact that the serving waiter was able to give a very good well rounded explanation of each of the dishes and recommendations.Food PresentationTaking a 6-course lunch, the appetizer was really good. I should point out that portions are relatively small, which was fine by me as I am a really small eater. Taste of the good is very good - kudos to the chef. However, I find that some of the presentation could have been better, Use of flowers and petals as a condiment and decorative are very common nowadays, especially in US and Europe. Here, some was ok, but the smaller thin yellow ones looks a bit too miserable, as they were just "sprinkled" without any flair! Also, I would have expected the waiter to be able to explain what type of flowers they are using. Unfortunately, this was not the case.The truffles does taste very flavorful, especially in the dessert brulee!Overall, it was a very good experience and uniquely crafted vegetarian dishes presented in interesting fusion style, and the pricing is reasonable as well

Had lunch at this beautiful 12 floor roof top garden inside an air conditioned glass restaurant overlooking the surrounding orchard area buildings, with beautiful water plants and gold fish swimming in the clear water pond right next to the glass. The service was good and the food beautifully presented. It felt like healthy spa food. The taste was good but not exemplary. It's 6 course lunch or 7 course dinner at a reasonable price. Wish there could be a la carte servings instead of just 6-7 courses servings as it would make it more attractive for me to return often. I would not want to come back too often for such elaborate dining.
5
We decided to try this out for lunch on a friend's recommendation. And it was amazing! The service was excellent. The chef customized the food based on our dietary restrictions. Each dish was explained in detail and presented extremely well. The price was a lot more reasonable than other restaurants providing similar level of service and quality. Most of the dishes were quite tasty. We were in a private room with garden view, and loved it. Its a must try for vegetarians! Would definitely go bac
5
One of my favourite restaurants! And I don't even enjoy vegetarian meals. The dishes are exquisite and creative. They can even make carrots taste like salmon sashimi,and mushrooms look like steak. I love their tea, which is different from the usual Chinese tea served in other restaurants.The service staffs are all friendly and helpful. If it's your first time at the restaurant, they'll explain how the dishes are made and would give you recommendations. I've visited them a couple of times, with family and friends, and they're all impressed with the restaurant. The food, the service staff, the ambience etc

Tried vegetarian cuisine in Sufood at Raffles City so was very excited when I read about this restaurant which has a similar dining concept as Sufood. Food are served in 6 course for lunch and 7 course for dinner. My husband and I tried different dishes so had a wide variety of food. Additional surprises were the berry green hot tea and the ice cold fruit juice for good digestion. A good fusion of food in Japanese French meatless cuisine. Healthy and tasty. I love their warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and ice mallow Apple Melody potion.The restaurant staff patiently explained what each course was and how to consume them. Ambience is good as restaurant is at garden rooftop 12 storey high. Parking is an experience as car had to travel up many storeys high, a bit giddy by the time we found a lot. There is only 1 lift that travel up to 12th floor from car park but others go to 11th floor and you can walk out and take escalator one level up. The only thing is there is only 1 shared toilet at 12th floor. Walk down one level for more common toilets
5
Absolutely fabulous vegetarian! Well worth a visit, the food is divine and the presentation and service impeccable. I like the location on the rooftop overlooking a pond, very zen! The photos on the website are very accurate depictions of what you can expect.
4
This restaurant has a great atmosphere and vibe. The food is intricately prepared and creatively plated. The entire menu is vegetarian but honestly you couldn't tell at certain points. The service is excellent and the staff are extremely attentive and interactive. Overall this is a great and affordable place for fine dining and an introduction to gastronomic menu
5
Family birthday celebration. Had the 6 course set lunch. We were very impressed with the food, ambience and service. My 3 teens enjoyed the food tremendously and that's saying a lot for non vegetarians. Special mention to Jom (think that as his name) for his attentiveness and efficient service. Great value for money and definitely worth a return visit
5
I am not a vegetarian, but this place has a wonderful cuisine! Based on various mushrooms, from the most common ones to truffles, the artistic presentation adds to the wonderful taste. The location, in the Sky Garden of Orchard Central, gives you a splendid view of Singapore. The service is punctual and excellent, and the owner M. Huang a very attentive, charming person. My second visit, and I will go back
4
I went to Joie with my friend and was seated at a table with good view of the Orchard skyline. The waiters were also quite attentive and introduce each course with a passion. I particularly like the chef platter where the salmon taste so "real". Generally the portion was just nice and the selections were quite diverse. I am going back to try other items on the menu
5
I was taking my daughter out as a special treat. We are both vegetarian and so often we have the usual risotto or tomato pasta, boring. But this was amazing! The care that went into the presentation was wonderful and the taste was out of this world
5
We had our Company 7 Course Dinner here and it was wonderful. Purely Healthy and Vegetarian selection of food from Starters to Main Dish except the Desserts. Each of every course dishes were delicious! My highlight is the Main course where I got the giant mushroom steak that looks like a meat *I've been fooled*. I also would like to comment their staffs who are kind enough to explain each of the dishes while we are choosing and their service was world class
5
Great service by the staff! We love the vegetarian food though we are not vegetarians! We believe that the chef took a lot of pride in his food as the quality of the food is very great! You will never think that the food is meatless. We had a private room as I had indicated that it is a birthday celebration for my husband. The staff is also very attentive to my 2 year old son.. ensuring that he has something to munch. Will definitely be back
5
The restaurant is on the top floor of a very tall building in Singapore. If it hadn't been raining very heavily we would have been able to see out over the city. The restaurant is decorated in grey and black in a Japanese style. Areas can be divided off for more intimate parties. Whilst we were there there were 2 family parties celebrating birthdays. The lunch set consists of 6 courses including a starter, a soup, main course, desert and drink. Free flow green tea with wild berries was very welcome and delicious. The food is all vegetarian but you would be forgiven for thinking it included meat. Each course was beautifully presented and the waiter explained chef's suggestion for eating order to enhance the eating experience.The service was excellent with right balance of friendliness.I will definitely be eating there again
5
My vegetarian friend suggested this restaurant. I'm so glad she did.We were greeted with friendly and helpful staff.You have the choice of a 6 course or 7 course lunch. The 6 course lunch is $38.80++. Sorry I can't remember how much the 7 course is.Each course was presented beautifully and they tasted so good. Even though I'm not vegetarian I would certainly go back.Top marks for service, food and atmosphere
5
If you have enough time and passion, than this is the right place for you. Otherwise it will just frustrate you coming here. Food is a surprise and also the drinks and dessert are a plus!
5
A vegetarian restaurant with the touch of art and fine-dining feel.
The staff were great and friendly. Very attention even though we were seated in a room.
Creative food and great ambience.
We had a room for our birthday celebration.
5
We have been at this restaurant at the Roof Garden of Orchard Central name JOIE BY DOZO. The food was delicious and love the creativity of the Chef. The service was fantastic. We are definitely coming back and we will recommend this place to our friends.Love the great experience at JOIE...
3
An experience at Joie once is enough. The good: convenient location right above the Somerset mrt station. Quiet setting. Great service. Knowledgeable staff. Lovely presentation of the food and drinks. Delicious sauces. I am not too impressed by thePetite food portions (2 bites). Sugary drinks (choose the hot drinks if you don't want the sugar). Hence I will not be going back as I think $70 on a non meatless meal will be more worth it and more satisfying.

Brought my good friend there for her birthday lunch and we immediately fell in love with the restaurant cosy setup and environment. We had the 6-course set lunch priced reasonably at $38.80++. The starter till dessert surprised us every dish and they were really tasty. Both of us really enjoyed every single dish and their service was excellent. We definitely must come back with our family to try

The location of Joie is very convenient and the fact that it's a completely vegetarian restaurant is delightful. The service is great - we were greeted with warm smiles and every item that we ordered was explained really well when it arrived. We had a 6-course lunch each - portion sizes were really good, flavour profiles interesting, and we left feeling just about right. The highlights of the meal were the appetizers - transparent Manchego cheese with peppers, olives, and walnuts; and the baked Cheesy Mushroom . Both were delicious. Soups and main course were decent. The poached pear in red wine with ice cream for dessert was a winner. I would probably visit again, for the service and that the pricing is pretty good for a fine dining place

It is rare that one across vegetarian restaurants that do not feature mock meats and manage to serve 6 course meals at reasonable prices with top class ambience. Joie by Dozo does just that. Located in the heart of Orchard road the restaurant serves a very reasonably priced lunch. The ingredients used are simple and locally available hence the price. The food is well presented and did not spring any surprises on us in terms of ingredients that look and taste 'different'. It tastes good, looks good and is coupled with excellent service. My daughter had informed them that my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and we were sent a little cake and another dessert on the house. Portions are not very large and people with big appetites may not be too happy. They were just right for us

This is a restaurant that does not serve meat! My company for the evening and I tremendously enjoyed the food. When you arrive, you are greeted with a welcome drink that was delicious. Their entire service staff was incredibly attentive, and after hearing that we had 2 birthdays at our table, surprised the birthday guests with a brownie each! Out of this world.We sat outside, which had a lovely view and was very private - only 2 tables, which we joined together to fit our party of 6. Inside the restaurant is a private room that you can book as well. We saw a couple with two really young children have a great, quiet dinner to themselves, so Joie is kid-friendly. The interior is spacious and well-designed.Really amazing place, and completely worth the price-tag for an exquisite experience

I went there for my wedding anniversary. We really enjoyed the vegetarian food. The menu was great and innovative. The staff super nice and very attentive. Just one thing to improve: the lights. They are too brights and they ruin a little the atmosphere. We will come back definitely.
