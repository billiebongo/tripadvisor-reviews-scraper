No menu available. Typical Teo chew food. Don't expect restaurant service standard but the lady owner is friendly. Expect to wait during meal hours. Make reservation before visit.

The food was so good that I can't get over it. Have to go back for their signature dishes like the steam fish, pork terrine, both of which brings back lots of fond memory.

This is certainly a great venue for authentic Teochew cuisines. Taste wise is amazing, classic taste which I grew up with and does brings back lots of memory!! Will be back for sure

Teochew food dishes are normally steamed, braised or stir-fried, and is considered a healthier cuisine as compared to Cantonese and other top Chinese cuisines. The classical food items include steamed fish, fried oyster eggs, prawn and meat rolls, braised duck meat and stir fried vegetables. These are the dishes which Quan Le Yan does very well. The setting is simple and clean. Noise levels can be loud when the place is crowded due to poor insulation. Prices are reasonable and the patrons are almost all locals.

This restaurant serve with teo chew style. My sister's in law highly recommend this restaurant. The only limitation if you are not Mandarin or teo chew speakers, they do not have menu :)So you can order with standard ingredients and the way they cook it will be in default.Their steam fish is awesome (the soup is special), water crest vegetable is nice, their so called "lala" (clam) is delicious (a bit salty), their prawn and ducks also nice. Their cray fish also nice. Price wise is mid range. I did not go to the toilet but according to my trusted source of information, you may want to settle "your business" before come to this restaurant

An old favourite for Chinese families, the staff run it well and the food is as gd as it gets. Don't let the nondescript banal interior fool you.Parking available at the back of Havelock road; there are two huge car parks to choose from. Try to make reservations as they can get very crowded. They are famous for the steamed pomfret (SGD$55), duck meat, ngoh hiang (like a meaty Chinese spring roll) and of course the yam dessert. The ginger fried pork was a pass and I didn't really like the sliced sauteed cabbage dish. Go for the old favourite recommendations from the staff and prepare for a chow down.

I was here in End November and was treated to various dishes of Teochew cuisine. Teochew is one of the chinese dialect groups in Singapore and there are many different dialects serving many different kind of chinese food and taste. Teochew is one of my favourites. The lead waitress was an old timer and what she recommends suits our palate. We had Teochew signature steamed pomfret, cold crabs, Sea cucumber, Ngoh Hiang and others. It was a gastronomic experience after years away from Teochew cuisine. The steam fish was very fresh and so was the cold crabs which was full of roe. The sea cucumber was one of the best I have tasted. Sure to be back

The place does not look great but the food is awesome. Of course you need to know what to order, because it's very local. I was there for Chinese new year tossing, it was fun and lots of Chinese will go there to do that. Visited by locals, that's usually the best signal. The owners are adorable
