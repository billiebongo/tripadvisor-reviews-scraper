Had ayam penyet at the centrepoint branch. Tasty chicken and generous servings. The chicken may have been a little dry because I ordered breast meat but it was still ok. Sambal was delicious and so was ketchup manis. Fast and reasonably priced. The fried kang kong was also decent

I will always walk past the Centrepoint branch after my haircut and wonder where the frangrance of spices came from. Decided to try it one day and I wasn't disappointed. Food was rather authentic and portions are generous. Restaurant's interior was spacious and bright, making it a great place for family gatherings

Worth your time to look for this small outlet to try out the Penyet! We ordered a fried Pomfret Penyet and Mee Soto. The balachian chili that come with the Penyet is not for the faint heart as it is really spicy. The chicken within the Mee Soto is tender and the soup come with a faint taste lime due to the added lime inside the soup. Do order the lime juice to take down your body temperature after the walk as well

"Penyet" refers to a cooking technique where the chicken is smashed with a wooden mallet after it is cooked. This separates the meat from the bones and further tenderizes it. This places does a great job of it. This is a small space, and the staff is very pleasant. They have both indoor and sidewalk tables.My chicken was nicely spiced, and cooked perfectly. I had actually planned on eating across the street, but the food was so bad at the other restaurant I threw it away and came over here. I'm glad I did.This restaurant is also halal certified, and has several other locations throughout Singapore
