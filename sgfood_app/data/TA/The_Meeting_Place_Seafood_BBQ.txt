Food is good but the quantity is too small that everytimes we have to ordered extra foods after my dinner at this place. The stall have quite a number of helpers. The chillies is one of the drawing point of customers. Without chillies, most of the food is so so only. Usually have to wait about 15 mins depending on what you order. Seafood fried rice is good too but portion is small. Overall, for 3 adults, it can cost easily cost you between $40 ~ $50 a meal

just a simple food outlet at clementi area but it's worth the visit.in their advertising they state: "you will be back for more"and they are right.not so easy to find, from mrt some 10 minutes to walk if you dont rush. surprisingly they have a facebook page too

First of all this place is hidden gem from the crowd. Which make the seafood come with a decent price tag.Secondly, they offer standard seafood BBQ menu such as Sambal Fish (varieties from red snapper to pomfret), Sambal shrimps, Sambal cockles, half or full cooked boiled cockles, Sambal snails, seafood or shrimp fried egg omelet, pan fried Sambal water spinach vegetable dish to garlic fried greens with oyster sauce. All these also include of special ordered sinful BBQ crayfish cook just the way you want it.With a few more stalls around, you are able to get your drinks and Indian pulled milk tea
