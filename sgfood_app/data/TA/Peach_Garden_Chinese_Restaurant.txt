Situated on the second floor of metropolis, this restaurant offers authentic Chinese food that is tasty. They customise food to your taste (e.g. no pork on the vegetable). They also serve dim sum. The seafood hor fan had succulent prawn. They serve it in small portions. The fried tofu with egg and crabmeat was so tasty. Nice ambience for formal dinners - has outdoor seating as well. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and polite.
