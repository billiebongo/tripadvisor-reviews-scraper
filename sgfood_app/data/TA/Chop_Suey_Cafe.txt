Recommended to us by friend who live in Singapore. Truly exceptional experience and now one of our favorites. Everything was cooked to perfection and the setting and view from the garden was fantastic

Love the food, the setting, beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. The food is amazing and dessert is to die for.....a great fusion Restaurant.
5
Have come here often and it is a wonderful restaurant with a fantastic menu, consistent high quality and fabulous decor.

Although the name gives the ompresdion that it is a cafe, in fact it is a - nice- restaurant.The food in this nice building is excellent( Asian) food and the service is excellent as well.The restaurant is not cheap, but which high class in Singapore is?In short: a good place to spend an evening
5
This was a bit of a hidden gem on a recent trip. Recommended by a friend we headed there and initially was a little unenthused by the name but I am glad we didn't judge the book by it's cover.The restaurant itself has a colonial feel and a lovely decking viewing out to the trees. The food (both Dim Sum and a la carte) were excellent - we ended up coming twice because it was that good.The staff were lovely and I wish I had a restaurant like this near me in London!Thoroughly recommend

This place is one of the culinary gems of Singapore. I love the location (a very tastefully renovated army base) - green and natural in the centre of a city is always a plus. I love the building - like an old 'planter's house' with verandahs and and a choice of tables inside or out. Cool traditional decor brought subtly up to date. Calm ambiance. Professional staff who do not fuss or pester but leave you to enjoy yourselves whilst being easy to attract when needed. Add to this some amazing food, well thought out menus, excellent cocktails (says a man who hates cocktails) and good wine and you have a recipe for bliss. Prices are not cheap once you have been tempted by all the unavoidable little extras (my ginger pudding with some kind of fabulous 'anglais' was to die for, but even at SG$120 (£70) a head it was well worth it. Thank you

The setting here was wonderful, we came at dusk for drinks and dinner and the sounds of birds and crickets amongst the rainforest trees was beautiful, with a distant view of the city. The decor is fabulous and colonial-style, it would be lovely for a wedding we thought. The food was also good, not outrageously so but a step above the Chinese food I can get at home, and nicest presented. The duck pancakes were great. The drinks were also good, I would return here. If you need pudding, you could do worse that the truffles

I was a bit confused with the menu of Chopsuey. Is it Chinese? Or Asian?Well, I really don’t care. Food was good, period. Truly enjoyed the different offerings from its wide menu: pad thai salad, hot and sour soup, steamed dumplings, szechuan pepper chilli chicken, Chopsuey itself, smokey eggplant ma po tofu, crab rice. Good pairing was with hot peppermint tea. Ambience is higher than average. Lots of greens around the restaurant. It must be better at night when cool air replaces the hot environment at lunch time. Awesome lunch at Chopsuey
5
Wonderful setting they did an excellent job in ensuring this authentic place is kept tip top. The food is a fusion/creative interpretation of Asian Cuisine and is well presented and tasty. The cakes that are freshly baked keep on staring at you so you will end up trying them for desert and share them. Service is ok too. Recommend to book the round table in the semi private area, it allows you to enjoy conversation and semi privacy too. The terrace is also nice, perhaps for a coffee afterwards. For smokers there is a proper area outside the terrace too and it does not interfere with the other patrons. Well done. For us more of a special occassion restaurant to mingle with old friends and their kids

When we visit our family who live in Singapore the Dempsey area is one of our favourite local places to eat - busy but not overcrowded or noisy - upmarket with a range of different cuisine on offer. This was our first visit to Chop Suey there and we thought it the best restaurant so far!Very stylish black, white, marble decor, modern but with a hint of Art Deco. Lovely big garden area surrounded by plenty of greenery...really nice relaxed atmosphere.We ordered a mix of starters and main courses to share....the crispy duck pockets and prawn toasties were especially tasty, and the ginger chicken and spicy pork delicious. Two main courses with different rice and an interesting salad were plenty for the three of us.. a real fusion of traditional Chinese food with a modern 'take' and one of the best meals we have had in Singapore this visit.The food and drink, especially wine and cocktails, were not cheap, to say the least. But we thought it well worth the cost and will certainly go again next time we come over! Recommended

What can I say.... service and food impeccable..... very professional staff.... rare nowadays....
A really good experience how dining should be.
Not really anything than good comments about this one.

The last time I visited Chop Suey Cafe was over 3 years ago. On going back a second time - I'm very happy to say, that it's as good as I remembered it from my previous visit! Very tasty - thank you!
1
I’ve been here twice now and love the space and the design. The owners have a great sense of style and the black and white interior, veranda and exterior are lovely places to relax and enjoy...but, the food is incredibly pricey and pretty lousy, the dim sum is dry and tasteless, the main courses on a par with pretty bad home cooking, and on a busy day the poor staff are obviously in need of more hands. Come for a drink but don’t bother with lunch or dinner.
5
With family who live in Singapore they took us out to one of their favourite restaurants - Chop Suey. The food was absolutely divine - probably the best restaurant meal of our trip around Asia. We ate outside on the veranda amongst all the beautiful greenery/gardens. We had the lettuce cups, crispy beef and dessert of salted chocolate truffles - which were amazing and I was utterly disappointed when I got home and realised I'd left the final two (which I had wrapped in a serviette to take home) on the table!Service was a bit so-so as when we arrived it took a long time for anyone to acknowledge us and greet us, and we also had trouble flagging down staff when we needed something during the meal - but they were very busy to be fair. Would definitely eat there again
5
Really enjoyed a late lunch here today. The food and coffee are good. Pork ribs very tasty fall off the bone. Dark choc truffles with salt, very rich. Golden banana with butterscotch... turns out it's a cake. It what I expected and not the best cake I've had.

Decided to try this place after searching the place called P.S Cafe over internet. Chop Suey is part of the same group of restaurants. This one locate at Dempsey is easy to find and tucked into a quiet corner. We did not make any reservations and just dropped in around 6pm and managed to get a table which we needed to vacate by 730pm, no problem.Being first time visitors, we asked the waitress for her recommendations and it the choices turned out good. We tried a phad thai salad, chicken with dried red chilli (it was like kung-po diced chicken), crispy orange beef and chop suet mixed vegetables.The phad thai salad was interesting as it was not fried but had the ingredients of the fried version. There was some glass noodles (or thin thai kway teow), large prawns (de-shelled) and the chef added salted fish bits which made a great impact on the taste and feel. The service was friendly and during our meal, 2 staff came by to ask us how is the food and how is everything. We thought it was nice of them. We did not try any desserts as we wanted to try ice cream at the nearby Ben and Jerrys. Overall Chop Suey is a nice and quiet place for a meal. The theme of the food was more along the line of Thai food (maybe we only tried those recommended). We will try and visit P.S Cafe in the future

Our friends took us to the delightful restaurant and what a lovely meal we enjoyed. Cocktails to start and I enjoyed a Long Island Tea made with real Oolong tea which gives it more of a bitter taste - so refreshing. This was followed by Starters of crispy duck pockets, san choi bao, and selection of steamed dumplings- all disappeared very quickly. When we tried to order a 3rd round of steamed dumplings our waitress politely but firmly advised not too based on the mains we had ordered. Thankfully we did not indulge. Main courses included shared bowls of egg fried rice and chopsuey vegetables - both fabulous especially the vegetables. Then individual choices of ribs, chilli prawns, sweet and sour pork, whole roast chicken and five spice powder and pork fillet and Asian slaw salad. Nothing was left but we all knew how good the food was. Flavours, sauces, spices, and quality just perfect. We would never have come across this terrific restaurant had it not been for staying with friends and their knowledge of local dining options. The area in Dempsey Rd where this restaurant is located is like a collection of every imaginable cuisine - definitely one to return to on another visit

We recently hosted international business guests at Chop Suey Cafe in Dempsey and were delighted to experience the serene outdoor ambiance by candlelight at Chop Suey Cafe at Dempsey. The design of the outdoor dining provides you the sensation of eating on an oasis, in the natural greenery of Singapore.The service is helpful with suggestions, courtesy and not pretentious, resulting in a relaxing evening dinner experience. A great choice for business dinners, dinners for special occasions and romantic evenings. The menu has a surprising assortment of appetizers, salads, soups and main dishes which I describe as contemporary Asian. Do not forget to try the Seifried Nelson Pinot Gris white wine; a perfect choice for the Singapore evening climate

I have reviewed a ton of restaurants on Trip Advisor, this is one of the worst in terms of overall experience. One hour and ten minutes for the food to come, then only 4 of the 6 got their main course. Another ten minutes the two omelettes finally came, did not know it could be so difficult to make an omelette. Then a few minutes later I had to ask for the side portion of sausage I ordered to be delivered. Crab omelette was really tasteless. No waiters anywhere to be seen. Had to flag down the waiter (looked like the manager) for the bill. Bill came but when we wanted to pay we gave up and just went up to pay at the counter. Terrible service, mediocre food. Wouldn't go back even with free food coupons
5
Where do I start?!?! Firstly..do not get too full so you miss the 'Salted Dark Chocolate Truffle' OMG..heaven on earth!!!! We came for dinner on the back of a recommendation from somewhere!! I say somewhere as this place appears to be almost forgotten. The staff, especially Karen and Liza (with a Z) are delightful and make the occasion even better than the food - if that's possible.
5
Enjoyed a family dinner here with excellent food. Recommend the lettuce wraps, duck pockets and definitely the massaman and rusty nail beef is awesome. Huge menu and friendly personable service.
The decor is lovely and location tip top. Recommend.
5
Location is ideal between all the venues of Dempsey hill. The interior is really well designed and resembles of another colonial era. Food is excellent.
5
Great food. Very friendly staff. Value for money. Relaxing ambiance for lunch or dinner or for that matter brunch, coffee or anything.
4
Came here for dinner while visiting Singapore with the family. The service from the start was very good. The food is very nice and they have a decent drinks selection. Wasn't too keen on the desserts however. A little overpriced, but overall a nice meal.
5
Chop Suey and the Dempsey area came highly recommended by an Aussie friend residing in Singapore. What a great choice, the old world colonial charm of the restaurant was amazing. The attentive knowledgeable staff looked after us like we were VIP's. The food was simply amazing and exceptional value compared to similar style restaurants in Singapore. If you plan on visiting go early or stick around after dinner and explore the myriad of bars and other restaurants available to enjoy a night cap under the stars.Rick & JulesAustralia
5
Were taken here with some expats living in Singapore and were not disappointed. The food was great and portion sizes were generous. The satay pulled duck was sensational. Wine list had a great variety and the jumbo profiterole for desert was great. Overall a great place to dine
5
This was a return visit and it didn't disappoint. Situated in the great Dempsey shopping area, in a quiet corner looking out over bush to the inevitable high rises. Fantastic Asian flavoured cocktails. Inventive fusion food. Service was good again. If you are visiting Singapore, put this on your list as a 'Not to be missed'
4
This was an excellent meal. We were two families with five young children in tow. Although the restaurant is housed in a beautiful old colonial building that looks quite intimidating for a family from the outside, it was kid-friendly with a variety of options ranging from a too-die for trout and fried rice that was a hit with all the children. The cocktails are spectacular (although on the pricier ranger). Overall, highly recommend a visit to this restaurant (or many of the other great options) in the Dempsey area
4
We love this place. In the last 6 months we have probably been here 4 times at least. Great drinks Super flavourful food. Must try the the Chopsuey mai tai, Sichuan chicken and the mapo tofu. Only recommendation I would have is that they consider including a children's menu. I wouldn't consider the place Super child friendly and felt like mine were in the way every time I took them. But hey the food is still great.
5
This is a very personal review as I liked the food because it brought back memories of my youth. In those days Singaporeans dined out, occasionally, at simple restaurants. The cook is usually a Hainanese man, and sometimes a Hainanese couple. That is, someone who came from Hainan, China. They cooked the best semi-western Chinese cuisine and they were usually nicknamed "Cooky". Chop Suey serves a selection of "Cooky dishes" and very authentic. Brought us back to our youth having Saturday lunch at University of Singapore Bukit Timah Staff House, or Sunday lunch at Singapore Island Country Club.We ordered the Crispy Fried Seafood Noodles, (very good). Medley of seasonal vegetables, Hainanese style pork chop fillets in sweet and sour sauce and potatoe chips (personal favourite), Crisphy orange beef (this is not Hainanese but a staple from Chinese restaurants in London, and done better than London), Smoked Duck Lychee Salad. Then we had the desserts and they were all excellent.Will certainly go back
5
A Great restaurant with an amazing ambiance! Great service but overall very very good food. Go here if you are in Singapore!!
4
Friendly but not over attentive service. Great selection of food and always well presented. Good specials which change weekly. Food always looks great. Good wine list.
Love the look and feel of the restaurant....old colonial.
A solid selection if at times a little expensive.
4
Basket press wine was on par with Australia prices in Dan Murphys. So if you're after something special at a nice restaurant then this is the go.
4
This is a chic upscale cafe that serves western style Chinese food. Yes, sounds strange but that's the way it is, and it is pretty good actually.
Food is a bit pricey, the service is excellent, quick and very nice.
5
Chop Suey on Dempsey Hill is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I've been here with kids, couples and business colleagues and it never fails to impress. The setting is old world, black and white colonial charm, with wicker chairs and ceiling fans. The service and food are outstanding and they even play 1930s classics in the bathrooms!!Favourites are the shredded duck pancakes, the fried beef in orange glaze (aka. rusty nails) and the sang choy bao. Try to get a seat on the verandah...it's inside but feels like outside and less noisy than the main dining room. I'm already looking forward to my next outing to Chop Suey Dempsey!
5
Our last day in Singapore and we were treating our hosts to lunch in one of their favourite restaurants.Colonial style restaurant with a good range of dishes on the menu. Waitress took time to explain whether hot/spicy and made some recommendations which were gratefully received. Seafood laksa was particularly good. Despite being on a development of restaurants , there were some nice views looking towards the skyline of Sinagpore.
4
I wasn't expecting much from Chop Suey -- I kept thinking it would be similar to bad American-style Chinese food -- but I was pleasantly surprised. Stuck to the vegetarian dishes as my dining companion doesn't eat meat, and everything we had was very good. Nice ambience. I hope to check out the Dempsey location soon as it is right near our home. I recommend
3
Meeting up with old friends I hadn't seen for many years I was delighted with the setting of this friendly cafe in what is basically an upmarket outdoor food court in a libel garden. Fresh zesty starters full of taste and variety got me ready for the speciality spicy bully beef and egg pie which sounded intriguing. What it was was quiche with the consistency of Yorkshire pudding with a cold hard poached egg and what tasted like my old middle eastern horror - beef bacon - on top.Stodgy wasn't the word. Tasteless wa
3
Great place to meet up with friends. Quite an expat vibe in this part of Dempsey Hill. Lovely building but quite noisy if you choose to sit inside. I feel that this place isn't really about the food it's about the beautiful location. having said that we had a nice time catching up with friends her
4
Nothing was too much trouble when our group of 8 turned up without a booking for a midweek dinner. We were seated at the bar and treated ourselves to a few different cocktails from those on offer - the mixologists behind the bar knew their craft and were really friendly to boot. Menu was adventurous and we were spoiled for choice. All meals were really delicious and beautifully presented. Sat out in the terrace and enjoyed a perfect evening. All 8 of us would return without hesitation. Hotel kindly called a taxi for us.
4
Colonial, ex army barracks type setting out of the centre but worth the trip. More fusion food than any one style.
4
Great food - love the lettuce cups. Great ambience and wonderful staff
The inside seating is a bit crowded and gets very very noisy
5
Great restaurant, food, service, atmosphere and in a very interesting location. I had the peking duck with a wonderful Australian Tempranillo (never had it before) and it was superb. Great spot and the restored building is beautiful!
5
Add to the above title, is attentive and friendly service. Will definitely go Back again as the menu is extensive but well thought out. The chef(s) are likely very enthusiastic and accomplished as the food was excellent. A very successful mix of Asian and western food without the slightest hint of trying to be fusion.
5
Really enjoy this place, a beautiful place. Nice for a romantic dinner or with friends. For dinner, seat in the outside terrace, you could be sitting in a garden. It is a mix of Chinese food for Western palate. Not too spicy or too exotic. The service was good and efficient
5
This restaurant is set in a lovely Black and White on the edge of Dempsey overlooking the garden. The food is delicious, although be prepared to pay a bit more than average. Service is usually very good and the atmosphere is a and classic. A great place for taking visitors or a nice evening with friends

Came here on a weekday for dinner. Ambience and decor - Nice, until you try to talk or read the menu. Have to talk loud in order to be heard, and lighting was very dim. I had to hold the table lamp right next to the menu to read it. Service - good, prompt and polite. Food - Average yet expensive1) Autumn, winter, spring rolls - Oily. Prawn one was alright, the other two had no taste2) Prawn toasties - Alright but forgettable3) Sticky crunchy baby squid - Not bad, crispy, with right amount of sauce4) Crispy crackly organic eggs with king prawn - Bland, oily, couldn't make out the prawn in the mess of egg. Or maybe was so dark I couldn't see it.5) Mud crab fried rice - Not bad, had wok hei.6) Suzy's spaghetti crab mee goreng - Tasted ok, although neither like spaghetti, nor mee goreng. Hardly any crab in it as well.7) Wok breath rice noodles with rare ribeye - Beef horfun, pretty much. Had wok hei, but overly salty.To sum up, food that average should not cost so much, especially when you know you can get better tze char at half the price. Table of 10, bill came up to almost $400, without alcohol. Didn't even want to have dessert after that, which cost more than $10 per portion
3
This place is between average to good depending on what you order. The char siew pau and crispy duck pow pockets were good. We also had Suzy's spaghetti crab "mee goreng" which was interesting but needed a stronger flavor (sorry, one of us grew up eating "mee goreng" and is not impressed). We stirred in lots of the garlic chili available at the table and the dish was transformed to good. Our last dish was the Singapore chili soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was well executed on its own without the chili sauce which we are not sure if we enjoyed so much as it was a little too sour for our liking but then that's the Singapore chili for you. The outdoor section is good for chilling. The indoor section seemed a bit too cramped for our liking. Service was good. Overall we like the place and would return to sample other items on the menu.
5
Chop Suey was always a regular for us when living in Singapore so when we visited last month it was on our to do list & it still didn't disappoint. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable & attentive & the food is amazing. They do the best orange beef (rusty nails!!) ever. Highly recommended.
5
Chop Suey is always near the top of the list of places to visit when we have friends or colleagues in town particularly looking for something with an Asian flavourRun by the guys from PS Cafe, you know it's going to be excellent service, a wonderful setting and top notch food.We generally order loads of different dishes and share amongst the crowd...never disappointed
5
I have now been twice at Chop Suey Cafe and it was in both cases a wonderful evening with nice friends. Tasty food, great selection of cocktails and wine.
4
We had lunch (2 adults and 2 teenagers) and had a lovely time, the food was nice (but a little pricey) but the setting was stunning. The service was good enough but not exceptional but the experience was enjoyable.
5
Take a seat outside, overlooking the forest and sit back and enjoy the best dim sum. The detail of the food here is amazing. Loved the atmosphere and the service was 1st class. Food is pricy but worth the treat
4
I reviewed this restaurant in Oct 2014 & it is even better now. The head waiter was so knowledgeable about the food we were choosing; he was also passionate about the quality of the food. My husband along with my son & his wife couldn't fault his recommendations & we had a very nice evening. The food was so fresh & tasty & served with pride. Definitely a must for a very nice meal & ambiance
5
Been here many times for lunch and dinners with friends as well as family. Love that it is tucked in a corner in Dempsey area, love that the deco is so beautiful and tasteful, love the service which is fast and efficient, love that they serve great coffee, love that they have a varied menu for young and old, local food with western twist and western food with local twist as well as great fish as well as meat dish. I had tim sum, friend had salad, kids had fried rice and noodles as well as burgers, kids have their shakes, we had our coffees. What more can we ask for in any restaurant. Service is fantastic but expect to wait a little during the busy weekends. A Fav with the expat community. Great for sharing dishes for dinners with a group of friends too.
2
I generally like Chop Suey Café - nice surroundings and food that is generally fairly good. Brunch on Sunday was awful. I had the bully beef & crackling egg pie. It was awful. I am not sure if it was supposed to be served hot or cold - hot I assume as it came with a lukewarm sauce. It was effectively a large wedge of stodge. the pastry on the base was so think I could hardly get through it with my knife. It was like a tasteless piece of thick cardboard.My boss had the Steamed buns which looked and apparently tasted nice.I will certainly revisit Chop Suey Café as my previous visits have been good but for me. at least, this was way below par.At the end it took around 15 minutes to return the credit card when trying to pay. Yes it was busy, but not that busy
4
This is certainly a "go to" restaurant in the Dempsey area. A quaint and well put together interior reminiscent of the colonial days and service staff that dress and behave the part. Good cocktails before dinner add to the overall feel of the place. The food is not haute cuisine but very good instead. The crispy duck pow and the baby squid are favourite appetisers, try to have some steamed or fried rolls as well. For a main I can recommend the Chili Jam Prawns. As the restaurant gets very busy you will need to make a reservation but if you just pop in there is great outside space to wait with a drink
1
We have been to this restaurant at least 15 times. Every time we have been there we have booked in advance and informed the staff involved that we are bringing wine with us for corkage. The restaurant has always charged $30 (which for Singapore is about the top end charge for a cafe style venue). We booked and informed them we will be bringing wines with us and when we turned up we were informed that the corkage charge had changed from $30 to $75 in October (8 days prior to our visit!). When we asked for the manager to discuss this 2.5 times charge for corkage she was so disrespectful as to offer 1 of the 8 bottles as free of corkage. For a large party such as ours, this turned a $240 corkage into $525 when you factor in her very poor discount. With no warning from the booking team this led to us walking out of the restaurant vowing never to return.Whoever owns this restaurant and chain should be embarrassed - this is a cafe, not a 3 Michelin starred restaurant. Charging $75 is fine when you have fine dining cuisine. For cafe food it is pure arrogance. This is the ruining of a pretty decent place. Your management on the night let a large party walk out without having the confidence to negotiate. We had a wonderful night at the steak restaurant next door. If they try to rip you off on corkage go to Portico Prime. Awesome food and commercial, empowered staff. A great eve there. Avoid Chop Sue
4
Booked a table for 14 people. Not conducive foe "all-in" conversations given that it was rectangular in shape. I am still trying to understand and appreciate what Dempsey Hill actually offers, in terms of dining experiences. Singapore is one of those places that a frequent visitor (10-12 times each year) that has the capacity to bore you with its sameness. If you go to Singapore and eat Western food then you have probably missed the point! Chop Suey has a nice casual atmosphere and the food is ideal for visitors, tourists and expats. You are paying for the location and atmosphere. Food quality is commensurate with the location but is hardly challenging
4
Spent a great evening with out of town guests at The Cafe and was not disappointed.Service is above average, food amazing and all wrapped up on a great venue with a full bar to fix that quench.Must try the pork ribs and we are big fans of the dumpling appetizer.Enjoy when you need to take those friends or family out for a great night out.Have not done lunch but I see the menu is packed with dumpling goodies and other great items
5
All good - top notch service with great food and wonderful colonial atmosphere. There is no public transport to Dempsey Hill, but Singapore cabs are quite reasonably priced. As it is out of the city, it is a lot quieter when sitting outside too.
4
A relatively new addition to the Singapore dining scene but already an institution. Lovely bygone years atmosphere and an eclectic mix of fusion dishes and cocktails. An opportunity for visitors to Singapore to go to Dempsey too.
3
The restaurant is nicely decorated, fresh flowers, black and white colonial style decor, and seating on a terrace for those who prefer some outdoor ambience. Food is suited for both Asian and Western palate. Portions are not very big but adequate.
5
Nice setting. Great flavours. We order almost all the starters and shared them Tapas style. Old army barracks converted into restaurants.
5
The setting is charming - a colonial styled building (high ceilings, black/white exteriors with bamboo blinds) that exudes lots of character. As with all dining experiences - the food is of primary importance & Cafe Chopsuey delivers on all counts. For all the skeptics that pre-judge this place due to its rather western style format - suggest you remove all preconceived notions. The food is absolutely delicious albeit some are updated with slight modern twists & the traditionals may frown upon this but one can't take away the fact that the food is simply yummy! We had sanchoy bao, fried white bait & duck wraps as starters - generous portions & easily shared by 4 people. Mains of lamb riblets, chicken & tofu were equally delicious. The food is a hotch potch of various styles - predominantly Chinese but with a slight twist. Service was friendly, helpful & prompt. We did not have room to try dessert but will definitely make room next time. Overall an excellent experience at reasonable prices in a very nice ambience. A great place for a casual get together. I would highly recommend reservations as the place was packed full!
4
PS CafÃ© is always a must for me when in Singapore, so I had to try ChopSuey ... Did not disappoint! The other couple we were with, also PS Cafe fans, had been there a few years back and said they really liked it that it's much better now (they didn't let on they weren't keen on going) and they will return. We had the duck pancakes which everyone said was excellent. Vegetarians will be happy here to. Had the vegetarian dumplings - excellent, the fried rice - excellent, stir fried vegetable noodles - excellent, Sichuan tofu was good though could have been a bit spicier, and we capped off the meal sharing warm ginger pudding w earl grey creme anglais- delicious. Service was perfect.
4
Within the cluster of restaurants around Dempsey Rd we chose Chop Suey for a relaxed dinner with friends. We were not disappointed. Unassuming, and good but underwhelming service delivered a number of great dishes, of which the beef with orange and the crispy octopus are to remain a culinary memory for a long time.Reservations recommended (that says enough) for this al fresco Chinese restaurant (nice colonial interior too)
5
Excellent menu offering local and western dishes, all cooked very well. Orders explained clearly by attentive and efficient staff and served with care. Interior and exterior has been carefully thought out and executed by same people who run PS cafe and other PS outlets. Toilets are clean and fresh
4
Never been here before and came on a recommendation.Rose the waitress started to recommend what we should eat so we just left her to it - she suggested and we order just the right amour for our party of 7 and a great mix for both starters and mains.So many good dishes!Outstanding serviceGotta come back here again
5
The restaurant is great! Very nice setting and location in one of the far corners of Dempsey. Service was excellent throughout. From the reservation, the welcome, during dinner time and farewell. All staff are friendly and give the place an extra touch. Food variety is great. We loved the numbing spareribs, tofu sechuan style as well as some of the appetizers. Good selection also of vegetarian dishes. We sat in the middle part of the restaurant, which feels semi indoor. we will be back, as all four of us enjoyed the dinner
5
With friends and sat in the outside eating area. Staff very attentive, food prices very reasonable. My absolute pick was entrée $22 - Spring Rolls.
5
Great cafe restaurant with a full bar. The ribs were perfectly cooked. They have an assortment of wine and a display of desserts. A verandah is located at the back of this once upon a time army barracks. Beautiful place to hang around.
4
Went here for lunch with the DH. We tried one of the specials - a dumpling dish. DH is Taiwanese so pretty picky about dumplings. The skins were delightfully thin but not so delicate they would tear and the filling was just the right consistency - not too coarse or pureed into mush. Flavors were well balanced and dee-lish!He was iffy about his entree - some sort of fried rice he thought was too sweet. But I loved mine. It was either pork or duck I can't remember. This is one of the few places I've tried (on two continents) that does asian things well AND western things well. Their menu is a little 'out there' for me. But I found things that were appetizing enough and so far everything I've had has been yummy. I'd definitely go back.The setting is really nice. It looks like one of those re-purposed old-timey buildings. Either an officer's house or a barracks. Black and White motif everywhere with lots and lots of glass. I was really struck by the ladies room. High ceilings, tile and a super nice light fixture. That may sound weird, but the food is good and even the washing up afterward is pleasant
5
Look for specials on the board - well worth trying! We had the amazing trout wrapped in rice paper, prawn balls in fresh coconut - both on the board and not on the main menu. The coolers are so refreshing. I loved the lychee and lime cooler. String beans, mud crab fried rice, crab omelette, pork chop, pork ribs, honey chicken were all great!Lychee granita is this marvellous creation of shaved ice with "bubbles" that burst in your mouth with a fruity explosion! We also had the apple galette - a delectable apple puff pastry tart with vanilla ice cream. Service was superb - Great suggestions proactively given and attentive to every detail. We had outdoor seats next to lush greenery but just a tad too warm on a hot Sunday afternoon. The decor of this whole restaurant is elegant Colonial yet comfortable and casual.
4
My wife and I plus my daughter and son-in-law dined here. The food was excellent (asian fusion) and the atmosphere good. The restaurant is in three sections - air conditioned, fan cooled and alfresco with fans. We sat in the fan cooled section. The service was beyond reproach. The food- and we had a number of courses, which we shared, was full of flavour and the helpings generous. As I recollect we had five dishes- which was sufficient. A most enjoyable experience and one which I would not hesitate to repeat
5
I can't begin to describe the vast array of flavours each of these carefully crafted dishes unleashes on your taste buds, but it's safe to say that you will not be disappointed with either he food or the service. A regular haunt of ours. A big thumbs up
5
This restaurant is in a very nice setting well away from the city centre. It's nice and cool with lovely decor inside. In Season the Singapore chilli crab is fantastic. Last time I had king prawns cooked with minced pork....delicious. I've eaten lobster there and, again....fab. Good idea to book for a large group so that they are set up for you but two or three will probably be fine to just turn up. Dempsey Hill is full of restaurants bars and shops in a wooded setting. Plenty to see. There is even a Swiss butcher. There are several antique shops too. Worth getting a taxi out for the afternoo
5
Such fantastic food, portion sizes, waiter staff, drinks, and desert to die for! Cannot fault a thing, we are here so often - perfect meal in a perfect setting, what more could you ask for?! You got to try the steamed ginger pudding - I have not had anything so delectable in SIngapore!

Food was not bad. But the service was poor. Didn't care at all. No "how was your meal?". Whisked the plates away without any comment. The wine bucket was away from the table. Wine glasses constantly empty and had to get up and get the bottle. No one even noticed. Won't bother going bac

We went to the Robertson Quay chop suey restaurant on a Saturday night, table for 4. Starters came after an hour, all staggered. Food was good in general, but service is astonishingly slow, and tables beside us left empty with dirty dishes for an hour. Probably won't be back in a hurry..
3
This place probably deserves 4 or 5 stars, but it's only getting 3 from me. Me and my friend ordered a dish, and after waiting for 20-30 mins, they only brought one and apologised that they only had one. Inconvenient, and irritating.
5
loved it - stunning place and food amazing. a title overpriced but otherwise rate it highly. the location and decor was beautiful.
4
I always come this place when I visit Singapore. Hainanese Pork Chop was excellent. The wok fried brocolli cooked well albeit a bit salty. The steamed tofu will provide some gravy for the rice.
3
This is an interesting take on chinese food, and has quite a few interesting dishes, and for an area known for bad service, the service was not bad.
4
interesting menu with good chicken dishes. we sat outside at night time which was a nice atmosphere.
5
An excellent twist on Americanized Chinese food! Very fund experience for the pallet. Definitely would recommend the dim sum platter.
4
Expensive as far as 'Chinese' food goes, but the cocktails are unusual and the service is very good. The food is tasty, but nothing to write him about. Waiters were very conscientious and charming, traits usually lacking in restaurants in Singapore. The decor is also quite stunning. You can elect to sit outside (in the tropical heat) near the greenery, or inside where the acoustics means that you have to speak at a louder pitch to be heard. Worth a visit.
5
Cant complain. Never had a bad experience here, Food service and choice of drinks are spot on. If in singapore on holiday make this a place to try as i'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I do each time I go with family or friends
5
We've been to the classy Dempsey Hill several times and each visit has been a hit! So when my son proposed taking us to the Chop Suey Cafe there for Saturday Lunch we jumped at the prospect. Even as we walked into the leafy corner ambience of the restaurant tucked away in the corner plot adjoining some fabulous greenery, we knew something special was afoot. As the courteous hostess saw us to our table out in the verandah of this bungalow, we were immediately impressed by the setting. We started with Vegetable Dumplings, yummy beyond words, tried the Hot & Sour soup followed by Jasmine Fried Rice, fresh greens and Chop Suey Chop Suey. All items measured up to expectations with the aroma of the Jasmine Fried Rice topping the list! Great place to visit on a sunny weekend, for sure
3
Having lived in NYC for more than 20 years, I occasionally crave for American Chinese food. I was excited to learn about this restaurant and decided to give it a try. While our dining experience was not disastrous, the whole evening was not exactly memorable either.The host was neither charming nor welcoming. The food portion was measly. While the crispy beef was allright, the General Tso's chicken was not. Service was adequate
4
Good reputable Chinese dishes. The specially like the lemon pork schnitzels. The thinly sliced dried limes were a nice touch. The jade gourds were beautiful also, but I would recommend it if you don't like fishy food. The dry shrimps were a bit overpowering.
5
Perfect venue with beautiful black and white decor. Enjoyed an extra long lunch (that moved into dinner) at this gorgeous restaurant.
Food was fresh and very tasty. Service was excellent. Good wine list.
Would thoroughly recommend to friends and family!
5
We chose to sit outside surrounded by tropical greenery. Delicious food, (you must order sang choi bau) good table service, a mention must be made for the ginger brûlée a great finale.
4
Set in Dempsey Hill old army barracks. Great fit out.
Had a mid afternoon lunch of many small dishes. Very tasty.
Ask them to call a cab when you finish as place is a bit remote.
5
Only 10 minute ten minute taxi ride from the centre of SingaporeWe knew we had made a fine choice as soon as. we arrivedThe colonial style of the building was tasteful, the dining area had a touch of classGreat menu with dishes some that were new to us, blew us awaySo many great options to choose fromWe had Rusty Nails (crispy beef in Orange sauce) and Szcheaun Pepper Chicken which were both wonderful, accompanied by great cocktailsIt is a restaurant we would most definitely recommend for a great culinary experience and won't break the ban
3
So I have to explain why I gave it an "average" rating... It's a beautiful place if you get a table inside. The service is friendly, if not always very attentive and all in all it is very agreeable to hang out here with friends. The only thing is, the food is so lacklustre. It's not in any way bad and some of the dishes are quite tasty, but we all thought it didn't quite deliver what the packaging promises. It's not bad, but it's just so very average. Without the surrounding interior design, one simply would not go back, because the food just is not worth going back for. Should you go? If you want an elegant atmosphere and a relaxing place to see friends, nibble a few bits and chat, then yes. If you want great, interesting mod-Asian food, check out some of my other Singapore reviews.
3
The food is not bad but it's not memorable. The staff are attentive & knowledgeable. The prawn toastie was disappointing - too complicated. The mud crab fried rice was delicious though - good 'wok hei', as the Chinese would say. Good selection of plonk, always welcomed. Space is beautiful, like all PS Cafes, so expected
4
The restaurant sits on a once upon a time British barracks. The setting gives you a sense of nostalgia. Food is richly presented on old world silver under liners and the bar was visible wherever you are seated. The cuisine is contemporary Asian and sumptuous. The chicken with a sweet sour savory sauce was delicious and the lamb was just incredible. It did not have a games taste at all.
5
This is a great restaurant for a celebration, a catch up or even a date. With indoor and outdoor spaces, a varied and interesting menu and a great list of wines and cocktails...it has something for everyone!! Thoroughly enjoyable...have been for lunch and dinner...and would highly recommend it to local and visitors 
5
Loved the situation in the old barracks with a variety of cafes and restaurants. Chop Suey Cafe has a great colonial feeling. Good, friendly service. Really lovely combinations of flavours. In particular, loved the prawn toasties and the spring rolls (especially the cod with shredded filo and the chunky crab). If you are interested in trying something different you could try the numbing pork ribs. I have never tasted anything like them. Not easy to explain but I ended up with a strange tingling tongue!!?? Apparently resulting from the crushed Szechuan pepper corns
5
I love the colonial feel to the place. Everytime you visit, the flowers are different. Dishes are fusion but somehow it makes you feel nostalgic at the same time. Prices are a little steep but I will definitely recommend this place to bring someone special.
5
Food to please every palate in an elegant setting, outdoor or indoor if you prefer some aircon. Dessert options include lovely gluten free cakes!
4
I love the Martin Place restaurant. The staff are good. Atmosphere is lovely. Certainly a place you can go for business or for a romantic dinner.
5
One of my favorite spots in Singapore. Try to secure a table outside. Love their food. The beautiful and peaceful location and some reasonably priced wines
4
Family outing at this restaurant , its visit, and we like it. Environment very warm and comfy. Wonderful food and service excellent. Will be back .
3
alcohol is obscenely expensive; too much fried/deep fried items on the menu (maybe this appeals to western taste buds), the tables are too small to even hold two or three dishes; had some sea food starters that were deep fried beyond recognition, some meat in an sauce that was too sweet and too sour and the same time, food is served a little too fast for my liking.would I go again: probably NO
5
The area used to be an old army barracks which is now transformed into a foodie paradise. There are restaurants, cafés and delis of all types and price points. Plus there are antique and homewares shops as well. A bit of retail therapy after eating.Chop Suey is a bright, high ceilinged space that is beautifully fitted out with marble topped tables, dark cane seats and large flower arrangements. The space affords indoor dining (with aircon) and outdoor dining both facing the garden and a terrace and a large pavilion room with ceiling fans. The menu offers an interesting take a wide range of traditional Chinese dishes, dumplings, rice dishes, noodles, seafood, meats, and much more. All cooked and presented with a new and interesting twist.We enjoyed duck pancakes – made for a confit of duck leg, kaffir lime and plum pork strips, yummy prawns and mixed veg. The ginger pudding to finish was light and very tasty. A great space with great food: this place is worth visiting again to get through the interesting and varied menu
3
We went there for brunch. The atmosphere and their terrace is great. Juices were fresh and coffee was good. Prices are typical Dempsey (on the pricey side). Regarding the food, we found that even though it's a fusion-type place, the dishes had one too many ingredients. The three of us ended up choosing dishes which had the least ingredients we didn't like (and even asking for a couple more to be excluded). While of course this varies according to taste, we feel that simplifying the menu will make it more appealing. Out of 3 of us with very different tastes, none of us found something on the menu which made us go" I want that" right away. We'll likely go back, but probably more for drinks and snacks on the terrace
5
I spent an afternoon here with a good friend...it's a shame we had to drive home because the cocktail menu was so delicious, it was hard to remain responsible and refrain from tasting the entire menu. The spicy Chopsuey Mai Tai and Shanghai Sangria were our favorites. My friend said she used to visit the restaurant weekly to satisfy a pregnancy craving for their chilli chocolate cake - - the servers knew her by sight and name and would have the cake ready to go! We nibbled on some delicious dim sum and I only wish I could have returned for proper brunch and dinner
5
go for it I did enjoy, every dish is freshly made, many of the dishes could be shared by two people, if you order chop sue vegetables and a honey ginger, plus an entree and dessert there is no need for more food, unless you are trying out different dishe
5
Our first night out in Singapore. What a easing surprise. Having been to Singapore a number of times but never went to Dempsey. Lovely food and ambience. Would definitely love to go back, as its. Rare to get good Chinese food in a cafe setting
5
I really like to take people visiting Singapore up to Chop Suey in Dempsey Hill. The mix of the beautiful restaurant and top-notch Euro-friendly Asian food makes it a winner every time.
Highly recommend their Sangria.
4
Good service, stylish ambience and food with quality ingredients. Dishes were Asian fusion and Chinese. Whole deep fried fish, stir fried noodles with seafood and morning glory were good.
5
Delicious food, great atmosphere. Quite noisy inside but next time will book a table outside. Staff very helpful and smiley. Easy location. Clean, bright and airy.
5
Went here last Sunday night after a long flight over from England. We chose it for our only night in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. The food was so yummy, the staff were lovely and very welcoming. The pudding portions were huge (that's if you have space after everything else!). Don't miss the chilli prawns and the duck pao. Oh and the chilli tofu and the squid. Not to mention the chilli chicken and the ribs. I could go on and on....A really fab restaurant.
5
Chop Suey takes old favourites often found in American Chinese restaurants and "re-creates" them with an interesting twist - often with a nod to Singapore. Good food, good service and a comfortable space. The prices are not inexpensive but within reason in the context of Singapor
5
Chop Suey in Dempsey Hill is a fantastic restaurant for a relaxed and intimate dinner with couples or friends. My wife and I have been here for lunch before with our children which was great and they have excellent dim sum on offer for brunch/lunch.This time we were here for dinner and had a very nice and relaxed dinner on the patio. The setting is brilliant with a really nice old style colonial feeling to it. Wait staff are fantastic with particular mention of 'Maverick' who is always willing to help and accommodate.The food is really excellent and has a great taste to it without being oily, which can be a problem with Asian food. The San Chau Pau as a starter and the dim sum basket were excellent, followed by Chilli Szechuan Chicken (lovely), Lemon Pork Schnitzel (super), and their signature Chop Suey Chop Suey veg (fantastic). They also have excellent, and huge, deserts and we had the Chilli Chocolate Cake (great) and have also had the Pavlova (brilliant).Whilst not the cheapest this place is definitely worth it for the food, location, atmosphere and the staff
5
Girls lunch for a fabulous woman's 40th...it was the perfect setting. First of all, our waiter's name was Maverick...we were off to a cracking start!Gorgeous restaurant with amazing flower arrangements. The food was fantastic, you must try the san choy bau, it is mouth watering good. We shared a range of dishes, definitely the best way to eat here and for the first time in a long time, I ordered dessert. They have a gorgeous glass display in the middle of the restaurant, so you can see the sweet treats before ordering them.Definitely a highlight of my trip to Singapor
4
In Singapore for work, I caught up with an old friend for lunch at Chop Suey. The setting in the old barracks has a very Singaporean feel and the decor did not disappoint. The highlight though were the dumplings and duck pow ... wow! We should have resisted the oversized desserts though and stuck with dumplings and the beautiful wine.
4
One of my all time Singapore favourites. Service could be improved but the variety of the menu and the consistently high quality preparation of the food makes Chop Sue a place to keep on coming back to. I was there with a group of work colleauges all of whom had not been there before and commented on how great the menu and food were. Definitely one of the best restaurants in this part of Singapor
4
A delight for the pallette. Surprising blend of spices make this place worthwhile. They are owned by PS Cafe and you will find similar ambience here
5
Undoubtedly the best Asian Fusion food I've ever eaten. The menu was superb and the flavours of each and every dish was out of this world. If you come to Singapore put it on your list
4
We enjoyed lunch and dinner in the restaurant which is nicely located on Dempsey Hill.
The food was good Asia fusion and the price absolutely in line with quality. Reservations recommended. Catching a cab can be difficult at night even after reservation
5
So the name suggests American Chinese Food which hints at very bad food. Very pleasantly surprised. We went for lunch. The place was full of atmosphere with the tiles and wonderful greenery. The place feels very classy and could imagine it right out of a TV set. Chinese Fusion food does not sound good but surprisingly when the food came out it was excellent. Not strange at all. Would certainly like to come back.
4
I went for lunch with friends at Chop Suey on Christmas Eve 2014. The location at Dempsey Hill is perfect for a post-shopping bite and the restaurant itself feels like a leftover colonial mirage! We sat in the covered conservatory and enjoyed fantastic cocktails while we waited for our food, which really makes it - dim sum, squid dishes and other mains - all delicious!It is comparatively pricey however it was a great little luxury in Singapore and I'd happily go back
5
If it's Chinese or Singaporean food you're hankering after, you're probably better off elsewhere. What PS Cafe's new concept does so well is the sweet, tangy flavors of one of one of America's most prevalent culinary subcultures - Chinese American. The restaurant is a classy, monochrome affair most PS Cafe fans have come to recognize in its portfolio of restaurants around town. On the menu, you'll find Chinese American staples like General Tso's chicken (drumlets), prawn toasties and the quintessentially comforting chop suey. Various renditions of chow fun and chow mein (or fried rice and fried noodles as the dishes are called at Chop Suey) feature widely in the restaurant's menu.Sure, Chop Suey isn't cheap and certainly not the touch-and go-experience one is familiar with at Panda Express, but it makes for a refreshing and enjoyable dining experience. Think premium wines and fancy cocktails paired with S$25 plates of beef and broccoli or Hainan pork chop. Chop Suey is best enjoyed in a group setting where you order plates to share. Look out for the mouth-watering daily specials on the chalk board.In PS cafe tradition, the restaurant also serves up an impressive array of delectable, confectionaries and desserts a la Chinois, ranging from lychee tarts to chili chocolate fudge cakes. Cocktails have a distinct tropical flavor to them. I had the Chop Suey Mai Tai, a flirty, girly concoction of rum and pineapple juice served in a thai coconut, and complete with a cocktail umbrella and orchard flower. Service as always is outstanding.Also, we loved the tongue-in-cheek messages in our fortune cookies
4
Food : Chinese food for Westerners ! This tastes like the type of excellent Chinese food you would have in London ( Hakkasan , Royal China ) or NY .. Light fares , but really excellentDecor : the terrace gives you the impression to dine in the jungle . Very green.Price : really full meal, and non alcoholic beverages amounted to 60 Sing Dollars per pax. A bit expensive in my view
4
I have to say the mixed reviews had me nervous before eating here. After eating here however, it's very apparent that if one expects authentic Chinese food (one reviewer mentioned better food at a hawker centre) they will be let down. That said the restaurant is pretty clear with what they offer when they say Anglo Chinese food on their website. If you want good food (I ate family style with 3 other people and all starters and mains were good or better) with Asian influence, inspirations, whatever you want to call it, I would recommend this place. The ambience is perhaps the strongest attribute and the service the weakest (perfunctory at best).
4
Lovely mid week dinner with friends. The restaurant has a great atmosphere but really it's the food which makes Chop Suey worth a return visit.The Chinese fusion menu is varied and interesting. The highlight was the Crispy Orange Beef which was excellent, colourfully presented with plenty of orange slices and zest giving the necessary balance to the dish. The Crunchy Greens were cooked to perfection. The rating is really 4.5 but the toilets were smelly
2
Situated at the back of its "sister cafe", Chop Suey is nicely decorated but dont expect the warm welcome at the door - probably lack of staff. The service inside was good though even if it is only when your menu orders are taken.Foodwise, both presentation and taste lack the authentic taste and aroma of Chinese cuisine - oh yes, it is supposed to be Chinese American. I have tasted Chinese American in San Francisco as well in the mid west Kansas City. This is neither.Pricewise, wow ... could have been better, much better in pricing. Either improve the portions or reduce the price
5
Very high quality and creative menu. It is a touch over-priced, but the modern setting is very well designed, and the service friendly and attentive. Sang Choy Bow, Sweet and Sour Snapper, Rusty Nail beef... all memorable.
5
Really enjoyed our meal here. Every dish was outstanding. Great cocktails, all very different. The chilli-chocolate cake (that we shared as we were so full!) was sublime.
1
Booked 2 months in advance for my 40th birthday and arrived to be told bar was too full for the 3 of us to have a drink? It wasnt. Was seared outside while 3 other groups were seated in front of us? Asked to be seated outside or under the verandah and was told not possible when there were plenty of tables. Specifically said it was a special occassion when booking. Should have known it was going to be a terrible restaurant as i sent two emails prior to my arrival and not a response. We left without dining as i will never pay for bad service as it generally matches the food quality. We went across the road on a Saturday night without a redervstion to Forketta which was lovely, great food and great staff
5
This was my fourth trip to Chop Suey. Our daughter found this delightful restaurant when she first came to live in Singapore. We visit each time we return. The food is excellent along with a good wine list. This is a quality place in a lovely setting. We have only ever sat outside but inside is very stylish too. I look forward to my next visit to Chop Suey- highly recommended
4
Very good Asian restaurant with quality food in a lovely setting. Along with my husband, son & his wife & brother & his wife we had a very nice meal here & couldn't have made a better choice. The food was as delicious as we hoped it would be. The interior of the restaurant was very stylish & the staff couldn't have done enough for us. The choice of food & drink was impressive & the quality of both was second to none. A very pleasant evening was had by us all
5
Recently when I was In Singapore, we tried out one of the PS Cafe's restaurants - Chop Suey. Loved it. Food was great, service was great. The interior is beautifully done. We sat outside, which was very pleasant. The friends I went with have been recommending it to their friends, they thought so highly of the food and service and just the general ambiance
4
Apart from the sweet and sour chips (adventurous idea, doesn't really work in reality) I've never had a bad dish at Chop Suey, the menu is great, the specials make a nice change. The only problem I have with this place is the service: we had to wait for over 2 hours to get all our food on the table - we only ordered 4 different dishes. Don't go here if you have time restrictions, which we did inform them of before we ordered but still took ages. Absolutely stunning location
4
Only a couple of weeks into my new life here, so not lots to go on, but I really enjoyed this place - taken by friends, sat in the garden, enjoyed the food, loved the ambience. I'm no food critic, but I'd describe the food as good old fashioned Chinese takeaway as you'd know it, but done in a modern fusion style - sweet & sour, prawn toast, crispy duck - and I thought it worked really well.Do sit in the garden, do enjoy the beautiful converted building, and do bring your credit card - it's not a cheap night out, particularly if you have drinks and wine, but for a special night out, it's a thumbs up from me
4
10 years ago Dempsey Hill was a bunch of carpet shops and antique stores selling last weeks products.Now it it is blazing night time experience only marred by bad parking.Chop Suey is the latest offering from PS Cafe. It attempts to blend traditional Chinese cooking with tastes we might remember from the US or the UK (although last night we were the only non-Australians in the place!)The setting is beautiful: an old house (actually military barracks lovingly restored. Make sure you get to sit outside in the garden.As long as you are not expecting authentic Chinese food, the tastes are pretty interesting. We started with three types of egg rolls (Not Spring rolls), and a crispy shredded duck concoction. For mains we recommend the roasted chicken with cinnamon and the classic orange beef.The Shanghai Sangria is a fruity blend that goes quite well with the food.Service was a bit weak, but friendly enough. Bill for two was about $150 with not a lot of alcohol so while it is not a cheap date it is certainly a good night out
2
After hearing good things and reading a few mixed review, we decided to try Chop Suey in Dempsey for ourselves. We were left disappointed with everything. The service was questionable, even though it was not busy and there seemed to be ample staff. Starters were tasteless. All 4 of our main courses came at 4 different times - who serves the rice first and then makes you wait for your main for 15 minutes? When asked where the food is, you get told the usual, 'it's coming, just wait a moment' ... A real disappointment, we certainly won't be going back nor recommending Chop Suey.
