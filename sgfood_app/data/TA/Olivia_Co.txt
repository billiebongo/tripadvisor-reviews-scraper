Stopped here for a quick coffee while shopping at the Suntec City Mall. Nice little place with pleasing staff.

Went to check this place out with family. I was quite pleased with the customer service. Very accommodating and helpful in every way. But just was disappointed with food - for the price you pay - not really worth the money.

For us Australians Asian countries are not well known for their coffee, but this little place is one we can definately reccomend. It's not the cheapest but the coffee is fantastic, service is great and the staff lovely. Suntec City shopping centre is our favourite place by far in Singapore

The deliciously prepared dishes were tasty and good. The restaurant has a lovely ambience with seatings in the atrium of the mall. It was a friend’s birthday and it was a perfect place to celebrate the occasion. Ali was very accommodating and treated me and my guest well. He made us feel special. I would like to commend him for his patience and hospitality.Well done and keep up the great service

Suntec management don't really get it - the place is loaded with pop ups, tawdry gaming shops and empty spaces. Even established brands don't seem to last long there but there is one oasis in the atrium between Towers 1 and 2 you might enjoy and it is Olivia & Co. Superb coffee and nibbly bits, a very extensive menu from homemade soups to generous salads, perfectly al dente pastas and a very fine burger - oh and if you fancy a glass of wine or a beer they have that too. The delightful Michelle and her team do a great job. Look out for the scooter and side car :) Cheers

Had a light lunch with a dory (fish burger) and Boston cheese bacon burger, with a cinnamon milk shake. The food was quickly served and tasted wonderful except extremely peppery. Our fault, turned out that both burgers had jalapeño sauces which of course we're very spicy. The waitress did offer a free ice cream to cool the mouth.Despite the spice, we both enjoyed our meals and went back next day and ordered the same less the jalapeño and the meals were even better. Would definitely recommend this place for a lunch or light bit

Today's review is the restaurant "Olivia & Co" located at 1 Sengkang Square, Compass One #01-13 S(545078). I've passed by this restaurant many times but our family decided to give it a try this evening. The number of times we passed by this restaurant usually not very crowded and somehow that place looks more like a coffee police than a proper restaurant but it does have a chill vibe and serves fusion food. We ordered the Chef's special "Kimchi Pasta" and "Egg Mushroom Frittata". The "Kimchi Pasta" is very tasty and the sauce is authentic kimchi, gives you an authentic Korean kimchi taste at the same time it was served with pasta instead of the usual Korean rice or noodles. They also have pancetta inside the pasta which made the dishes different from the usual pasta you find in suburban Singapore. The dish costs $14. The "Egg Mushroom Frittata" also did not disappoint. The shiitake mushroom is succulent and served with generous dollops of cheese. We added ham to this dish. In my humble opinion, the dish will taste even better if they added spices like cayenne pepper. The dish costs $12. Another must try is the "steak and fries" which costs $13. We ordered the steak at medium well and I must say it was tasty! Absolutely tasty and comparable to some high end restaurant which may not serve that nice steak. It is tasty and juicy and the meat quality was also not bad and the price for that steak really made it worthwhile. I hope the next time we visit, the standard of the steak will not drop. The ambience is good for a cup of coffee or dinner with family or ice cold beer with a Friend. The staff are not utterly friendly but they are efficient. It's ok considering this being a neighbourhood restaurant

Stopped here for coffee. The worst coffee in Singapore and that's saying something. Cappucino was just luke warm and my husbands iced americana came to the table as a hot coffee. No problems, she took it away, put it into a shaker with some ice cubes and poured it into glass with straw and brought it back to him. NOOOOO!!!! AWFUL

I been here twice. First visit was not so memorable coz I did not like the salads but chicken wings & garlic prawns were ok. Now, second visit was better. Austin Melt Sandwich is sooo good. My fave item on the menu. The king prawn spaghetti with truffle oil is okay but will not necessarily order it again. Cafe Late is good but I had to ask for extra milk to tone down the strong coffee. It turned so good with extra milk. I might be back for coffee and sandwich.

Enjoyed the ALL DAY breakfast though is 1pm. Food taste good! I personally enjoyed the quieter crowd on a Sunday afternoon.

We stopped for lunch- the vibes were good, great seating area, associated deli food store. Both of us ordered Thai beef salad that disappointed in the quality of the beef and the dressing.
Worst meal we ate in Singapore. Perhaps just unlucky on the day?

Located at Suntec Tower 2 level 1. Nearest train station will be Promenade (Blue / Orange Line). The menu have got quite some fair selections. They have all day breakfast (western kind), Spag, roasted chicken etc. Food are pretty big portion. They also have drinks like shakes, coffee, tea and beers Service staffs are all pretty polite and friendly. When request for a change to a bigger table, they even apologise for giving a small one table earlier. Pretty impressed on the service level. Price are pretty normal average. But I think the sides are maybe a little too expensive.Experience is overall great and will re-visit this place.

Cool little local concept, that hinges on more fusion, with a great coffee and super juices, sure beats the plastic tables and paper trays at Pasarbella. Comfortable funky patch seats, not over pricey, like kith or PS, Had the Soft Shell crab pasta and the pulled beef rib melt, tasty as. All round a cool easy place with out the pricing to match, has become a regular for our morning go to coffee and fresh cakes. Each to their own,if you want 6 dollar food and dirty plates, head to food market, or pasarbella,here at least they remember our names when we come back

We stopped for having lunch at Olivia & Co because the place and the menu looked nice, but at the end everything was terrible, the service was slow and very poor, and the quality of the food was awful. Definitely is not a place that I would recommended it
2
The restaurant was decorated with colourful patchwork chairs, and the menu seemed promising, which eventually brought us into the restaurant. However, the dining experience was somewhat of a disappointment.We ordered the Fisherman's Pasta, and the squid, prawn and clam were evidently not fresh at all. The flavours were all right though. We also ordered the Boston Burger, which was rather normal. The food took quite a while to be served, but at least the service was all right.Don't think I'll be back though

Stopped in for a quick lunch at Olivia & Co but it wasn't quick, as the service was slow, abrupt and definately no smile. However, what made it so fantastic was the quality of food. We had the slider share plate and a couple of bao's and they were seriously off the hook. I wasnt expecting such high quality food in the middle of a shopping centre. Thinking of going back tomorrow.

was at Olivia & Co (Compass One) to have dinner. it wasn't even a full restaurant. had to wait 30 min for our 1st main to arrive ( Black Forest Shrooms burger ) then another 10 min for the 2nd main which was the sliders. there's no sequence in the food served. you may have order earlier than me but you may be served much later. Fries and the beef patty was salty.feedback given but the response from the staff was a shrug followed by a okay.great disappointment

Loved the restaurant's ambience, decoration and eye-catching colour coordination. Service was alright, staff was knowledgeable and provided recommendation. There were colorful plastic plates for children but there were no matching cutleries to go with them. Carbonara was great - tasty and creamy with the perfect consistency. Cheese and steak (served with fries) was okay - nice fries but disappointing steak

We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. After googling for a restaurant and thought from the website, it looked adventurous and interesting. The restaurant serves adventurous dishes and we were quite disappointed with the limited variety. Thought we could try Beef Rendang a local delicacy but it didn't whet our appetites at all. A regret indeed. A friend selected a carbonara (chefs recommendation), and commented it was good. The service was not fantastic and we had difficulty getting the waiters' attention when it came to asking for the bill.
