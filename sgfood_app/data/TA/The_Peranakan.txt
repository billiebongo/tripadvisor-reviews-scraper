A real taste of the unique Peranakan culture. Our meals were absolutely delicious, in quality and presentation.

Very good Peranakan food, tasty and authentic. Useful explanations are given about the dishes. The restaurant is pleasant and nicely decorated.

The worst food in Singapore. Tried ripping us off with charging for hand towels and some small snacks that we didn’t even order.
5
Lovely and cozy ambience, perfect for catching up with friends and tasting different types of peranakan food.

It is an over decorated resturant with poor taste. Misrepresenting the Peranakan culture to fool the tourist. The real Peranakan house look nothing like this theme-park-like tourist trap, full of gift items like a departmental store meant for tourist. The resturant could accommodate at least a hundred guests. Poor ambience. The food taste is average but eatable. Dessert portion is small. The waiter who served us was obnoxious and full of himself. We paid S$57 per head for an average Peranakan meal. Not recommended

We visited this restaurant for the first time during the CNY period. The Beef Rendang was tender and succulent but the rest of the food was average. We got a shock when we receive the bill. We were prepared to pay more as it was CNY but the CNY prices were up to 40% higher than usual. The worse part was that the dishes were not the most expensive of the lot. It turned out that the Longan Red Dates Tea was the most expensive item. It was a staggering $52 @ $6.50 each and included a child who does not drink tea. The unlimited white rice and the Hei Bi Hiam snack were the other items charged for every pax despite the fact that not of us asked for it. Granted the rice and tea were refillable but i believed customers should be informed about the charges beforehand since the cost is high for the all pax items. Otherwise the overall ambience was good and the staff were polite and responsive.

We looked on the internet for authentic Malaysian cuisine and this restaurant came up. The bonus for us was it was actually adjacent to our hotel in the clay-more connect centre which we could access internally. It is quite old fashioned and quercky. The staff i think had been there a long time and it was family run. We were almost the only ones in there but it was 7,45 and the centre for food closed at 9pm so i do not know what it would have been like during the day. The waiter was very pleasant and attentive. The food came a bit mish mash we ordered a starter to share and the main meal arrived at the same time..... We sent it back until we were ready but i suspect it was put on a hotplate until we asked for it.... It was however good and enough for both of us. We were not pressured to leave when we had finished. Would i go again maybe but would prefer to try other establishments. They did have a sign outside saying no MSG included in their food which for me was a plus..

We chanced upon this restaurant as Hua Ting restaurant was full.We ordered beef Rendang, Ayam Buah Keluk, Kueh Pie Tee and omelette. I find the dishes were pretty above average and tend to be on the sweet side. Service is attentive and unobtrusive. The ambience is befits a true blue peranakan as you will find many treasures of its culture.
5
Four of us had the high tea menu, which consisted lemongrass pandan tea, mee siam, various ‘finger food’ (toast with durian paste, kueh pie ti, pineapple tart, ambon etc). Service was excellent with the wait staff checking in on us occasionally - probably because it was a Monday afternoon and it wasn’t packed. Would have to try the a la cart menu to give a more conclusive review, though. As for atmosphere, it feels too hypertraditional, bordering on crass. Peranakan stuff are everywhere to the point where one couldn’t tell which is for sale or for patrons’ use, and to tell apart the tablecloth and decorative textiles. That, however, is inconsequential, and merely an observation.

We were recommended by the very nice elderly gentlemen serving us to order the "specialties" of the house i.e. the Ayam Buah Keluak, Assam Pedas Fish Head and Ngoh Hiang. We also tried the Itek Tim (Duck and Kiam Chye soup), Bakwan Kepiting and the Terong with sambal. Frankly, the only thing that stood out for us was the 2 small bowls of sambal blachan; the Buah Keluak and the Itek Tim were passable . Overall, we were deeply disappointed with the quality of the food, being veterans at cooking and eating Peranakan food across Singapore and Malaysia for decades.The Ikan Assam Pedas was watery and tasted watery. We could not detect any of the usual piquant flavours of the serai and langkuas that should be associated with this dish. It was just sweet, not even chili hot. The filling of the Ngoh Hiang was mashy and sorely lacked the crunch of water chestnuts that gives texture.My friends who had ordered the Bakwan Kepiting commented that the broth was bland and the meatball lacked the (usual) robust combination of the bamboo shoot, crab or pork. It sure didn't look anything like pictured on the menu.The steamed Terong (brinjal) with the sambal was not a winner either. The vegetable was still a bit hard.Even after an disatisfactory meal, we persisted to order dessert, thinking at least a good sweet could salvage the situation. Again, we were sorely disappointed. The Gula Melaka Cake was a poorly made pandan swiss roll drizzled with Gula Melaka and the Chendol Melaka was anything but! When the chendol arrived, the first thing that made us literally gasp was the bright green colour of the strands. Horrors! If the restaurant can't produce the original strands made with Hoon kwe flour and pandan juice and choose to use these with the artificial colour, then we say - epic fail! To top it all, the shavings of ice was as rough as can be. The meal for the four of us came up to $45 per person. On a positive note, the decor and service were very good. Pity.

Situated on the main Orchard Road of Singapore, The Peranaken is a an absolutely must try.
A mixture of Chinese and Malay cuisine styles the food is interesting and tasty.
Large portions and reasonable prices.
Do try it if you want to taste something different.
4
A good place to go for authentic Peranakan food. Love the petai prawns and fish curry. A nice evening out, overall!
4
Distinctly Peranakan flavours on the menu here. Charming ambience and good service too. Worth revisiting with family and friends.
4
Food was fantastic, flamboyant ambience and excellent service. The Peranakan crafts available were pretty tempting to the wallet too. Overpriced though.
4
Beef Rendang was rich and good. It met our craving. The fish head curry was very fresh but It would have been better if the sauce was a little thicker.
Generally, good!

My Husband, my parents and I recently visited The Peranakan for dinner and came away completely satiated. Located in the concourse within Orchard Hotel and helmed by Executive Chef Raymond Khoo, they have utilised the space to create a wonderful Pernakan experience for diners. The bright floral wall paper, the batik cushions, the mini chandeliers all set the tone for the meal to follow. Wanting to try out a range of dishes we ended up ordering quite a few items. The kueh pie tee was wonderful with thin and crunchy casing. The star among the appetiser section was the ngoh hiang. Every single main item we ordered was flavourful and almost felt like we were eating home cooked good food. The beef rendang was melt in your mouth delicious and the sambal udang with ladyfinger was a pleasant surprise. None of the spices were overpowering, it was a perfect blend of flavours. The Ayam buah keluak, the Babi pong teh and the nasi ulam istimewa were equally finger licking good. Unfortunately, having had such a grand meal we didn’t have any room for dessert but that just gives us an excuse to go back once more.And the best part is that they have amazing takeaway deals as well as set menus - all without making a hefty dent in your wallet. If you want to takeaway a piece of Peranakan culture and fashion with you simply browse through their store section and you will not be disappointed.

We really enjoyed the food and drinks served at The Perankan, the staff was very approachable and friendly. They took time to explain the various dishes to us and had recommend some! Personally, i really liked the high tea set as they all came in small servings so we could try the other dishes that came with the set. Ambience is on point!
5
Our first visit and definitely will not be the last! Everyone at the restaurant are attentive to our request and when I say I will return for lunch next week they were so nice and sent me a 1-for-1 deal! I’ll highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who like Peranakan food!

Ordered the chicken buah keluak,sambal prawn with petai,pork & shrimp rolls(ngo hiang)& nasi ulam.Generally the food is delicious & really have the exquisite taste of traditional peranakan cuisine.The durian chendol of course is the highlight of the whole meal, really the best chendol I’ve ever tried

At the suggestion of our Singapore tour guide, we decided to have a traditional Singapore meal before flying home the next day. The Peranakan was convenient to our hotel. Wait staff tried to offer suggestions about food and beverages. We mentioned that group was not especially too hungry after a late lunch. So, many opted for an appetizer or soup, or sharing one entree. Woman hostess kept suggesting a white wine that appealed to no one. Most had hot tea beverages, one a Cola, one a fruit beverage (no alcohol) all averaging $6.5 S$. My appetizer (shrimp balls $15). Small bowl of broth type soup $9. Upon being seated, each place had a small woven basket provided with a type of shrimp rolled cracker. Very untasty, none consumed. Not ordered, just provided. Each place was provided a wet-nap foil packet. Any street food consumed during our 30 day stay in southeast Asia surpassed what we were served. Bill arrives - accepted only Singapore Dollars in the total of $176.00 for six who ate very little. We were charged for the basket crackers ($3.50/ea), wet-nap $1.50 each on top of mixed up orders. NEVER AGAIN - and I will be alerting my tour guide to not send his clients here either. This restaurant is one big rip-off in a city where everyone takes pleasure in serving and making your wishes fulfilled
1
Completely overpriced for the portion they serve. Never order this from ubereats either, even more expensive but quantity is so little (photo of bakwan kepeting soup - this is what I got for $11). Quality not great either. Service is rude and unhelpful.

We arrived The Peranakan at 11am on 8th Nov 2017 , a waiter with floral shirt greeted us. We had asked him if we could have eatigo 50% off for the high tea set and he said yes. However upon paying the bill, another guy came and said there is no discount for the S$48++ set tea for 2. The guy with floral shirt just said he made a mistake. They were very impolite during the settling of bill. After I went home N double check the bill, I realized that they had over charged me with 2 drinks which costed S$13.0 (S$6.5 x 2) which were told to be included in the high tea set menu when we ordered the set by the guy in floral shirt. Also S$3.2 were charged for 4 wet towels which were not given at all. 4 x Hei Bi Hiam Snack for S$6 were charged but the snack was not in sight. I do strongly think that Eatigo should remove this restaurant from their list so that other customers won't get the same bad experience like me and my guests from overseas. They had over charged me for S$26/- excluding the 50% that we thought we were entitled to get. If we add the the 50% discount for the high tea set which will come up to S$54 altogether.Our bill for 4 persons were S$130 with just another 2 juice S$8 each (no discount but not mentioned) n another 2 dishes (S$7.5 & S$11.0 after discount) on top of the high tea set. With this lump sum I could have 4 (1 for 1 buffets) with at other better restaurants or hotels

We really enjoyed with the liver Ngoh Hiang and the chicken buah-keluak and would recommend these. The desserts were also good esp. the chendol melaka durian. The Sup Bakwan Kepiting meat balls could have had a bit more kepiting in them. All in all, an interesting experience. However, for my personal taste, the decor was a bit over the top and somewhat distracting.
5
Having been born n brought up until early adulthood in Singapore before migrating to Canada I can personally attest to the food here tasting closely to what my maternal grandmother used to cook. The buah kalwak curry was delicious as well as the 'Peteh prawns'. The Executive chef was very gracious n took the time n effort to come out n meet us and chat and you could see that he takes pride in his work n cooking. My compliments n thanks to him n all his staff for a wonderful evening that brought back fond memories of food I had not tasted for a long, long tim

The restaurant is on the second floor of the shopping part ( Claymore Connect ) of the easily accessible Orchard Hotel. The decor is authentically Peranakan and the ambience inviting and friendly. We had the Peranakan high tea set ($24 per head or $35 for two) . The set consisted of a bowl of mee siam, and a choice of Malacca tea/coffee or lemon grass with pandanous. These were followed by several kinds of typical Peranakan food and desserts beautifully presented in a round tray . All the items were authentic and delicious . The menu is very compressive with a range of typical Peranakan food. A lovely place for a very satisfying Singapore experience.
3
Weekend afternoon tea set is nicely decorated in old school cutlery that I remembered we used to use at home! Mee Siam was good with well balanced flavour of spiciness and sourness. Coconut with glutinous rice is great! But there are a couple of pointless dishes like the shrimp bites on toast and baked toast with durian melaka dip. I suggest to skip the afternoon set and go for ala carte items instead
2
Was intrigued by the decor and dishes in pics from Google posts hence our visit.However the experience was dampened by the service staff particularly a male staff of darker skin. There was no smiles from him and was only interested in taking our beverage orders for high tea set and nothing beyond.Food was sadly not truly penarakan. The price we paid was for the decor and comfort...which defeat the purpose of tasting peranakan snacks. Unlikely to return..
3
Place offers an excellent peek into Peranakan culture, customs and food but the high tea deal was not worth a second visit. Instead of you choosing what you want to eat from long buffet tables, the restaurant had already decided what you should eat through their prepared tiny bowl of mee siam, small aluminium pot of lemon grass tea and beautifully presented high tea tray saddled with ordinary Peranakan kuih kuih plus tiny quartered bread slices with chillied dried prawns. Quite a disappointment
5
Just had dinner with wife & kid. I grew up in a Peranakan household & my (late) mom was a Bibik housewife who cooked meals for the family on a daily basis. What I can safely say here is this: on top of being MSG-free, the food here is true-blue genuine Peranakan cuisine. It may be a little on the expensive side, but you get the real deal here
5
Decent homey portion for a hearty meal! Gravy are very lemak! Well balanced, not overly salty. Waitress are attentive too despite a busy full house. I didn’t even have to request for water refill! Very happy and touched by such attentiveness! More restaurants ought to be like this! The welcome starter mini fried prawn rolls are so very good so are the complimentary pineapple tarts! Not overly buttery and fillings are not overly sweet! It’s perfect! Only grouse was that I had a surprise cake for my friend and they ruin the surprise by informing them that they (the restaurant) have received the cake!! And I think if the lighting is slightly dimmer might have created a better cozy ambience for the night...
3
It was my first and possibly last time I will visit the the peranakan despite the fact that the atmosphere is pretty good. The pricing is on the high side however taking into consideration on the efforts required to dish up a peranakan feast, I would say it is still acceptable. In terms of taste, it wasn't bad but definitely forgettable in my opinion. The desert is the best among the entire course
1
Just had lunch there after the Orchard Hotel concierge recommended it. One of the worst meals I’ve ever eaten. Beware the Hei Bi Hiam Snack that comes before the meal - we assumed it was complimentary but we were charged $6 for them. Also charged $3.20 for 4 x wet towels that we didn’t use. When we complained we were told that it was standard in Singapore. Lunch for four was $108 - outrageous!

My friend and I were there yesterday afternoon to enjoy a tea session. Water was not offered or served. The hi tea set we have is mostly bread. Worst of all we had 2 strips of toasted white bread served together with the pie tee, meet Siam, kong ba bao and hae bee hiam sprinkle on soft white bread. Food served are all cold except meet siam was warm. When we told the wait staff about serving the 2 strips of white toasted bread later, we were told its a practice we serve all food together. When my friend asked for tea refilling, we were told there's no refill. Usually when we do high teas, its refillable. When we feed back to the manager, he was very defensive. Instead of being customer service orientated, he was showing us an attitude "shut up and don't come back". He was being told off that we will not come back and will not recommend! He didn't thank us for patronising instead brush us off! Just read some negative comments and its exactly how we felt. Even owner is not humble, how to surviv
5
We had a small gathering on Monday 18 Sep and we ordered 2 sets plus 1 side dish for persons to share. Very nice portion and authentic Persnakan cuisines. Beautiful presentation and tasty food. Good ambience with peranakan decos and set up. Location was convenient in the stretch and hub of Orchard Road within 10 mins walk from orchard mrt. The staff were attentively and polite. The price was reasonable and promotion 2 for 1.Nice place to eat and enjoy
1
There were 6 of us altogether having high tea in August. We had the one for one deal. Price were way too expensive and very small serving. Everyone was still hungry after all the food. Wanted to order fried hokkien mee for 6 person and we were told it will cost us S$47. That is ridiculous!! Who on earth will pay for that price?? Food that were served:Mee Siam -small bowl, smaller than a rice bowl Nasi ulam - very small plate Kueh pie ti - 1 cup per person n I small prawnPrawn ngoh hiang -,1 small slice per personDurian purée on toast - I small pc per personHae bee Niam on bread - I small pc per personBlue pea glutinous rice topped with gula Melaka coconut -,1 pc per person (size of a fish ball)I small pc of kuey - 1 small pc per person A small pot of tea/coffee/lemongrass tea per person All the food are cheap stuffs. Will definitely not recommend this to anyone

We had the farewell dinner for one of the colleague before she leaves Singapore. So, we give this restaurant a try. I am happy she likes the peranakan setting,ambiance and foods. Is also our first visit to this restaurant and we ordered about 10 dishes. We recommend Kaki Babi pong Teh, Goh Xiang and Sambal lady fingers. Others like Ayam buah keluak ,Chap chye, Assam fish, cendol is rather average. That's all we can commend cause still got other dishes we had not try yet. However, the food is rather healthy cause no MSG !!

For really good Peranakan dishes, go for PeraMakan. You can't go wrong there. It'd be cheaper than this restaurant.So what do I like about this restaurant?1. Location - just 8-10mins walk from Orchard MRT station.2. Decor - this restaurant is heavily decored so in a way this is a very good place to show the peranakan artefacts to foreigners3. Food is generally acceptable - for the uninitiated, they would say the food is great here.What it is that I do not quite like?Service - staff can be quite friendly. They are always around but somehow it still takes some effort to catch their attention.Price - not exactly cheap. I'm quite sure that it'd be cheaper to have a similar meal at PeraMakan.Dishes - we ordered : Kueh Pie Tie, beef rendang, meatballs soup, satay, ngoh hiang (meat rolls), chap chye (cabbage) and cendol. Only the Kueh Pie Tie, soup and ngoh hiang are nice. The other dishes are just alright. We also ordered lime juice and coke. SGD$206 for this meal for 3 persons.The restaurant is heavily dressed up in Peranakan fabrics, furniture and porcelain ware displays. Quite loudly decored, in fact. Again, a good place to get a concentrated glimpse of the Peranakan decor.The restaurant isn't very large. It's located inside the shopping mall section of the building. Dining tables are located both inside the restaurant and also outside the restaurant. There is a large porch area there and the restaurant uses that space to add a few more tables. During dinner time on weekdays, the people traffic in that building is very very low so it's still quite comfortable to have your meal at the porch area.This restaurant tries to re-create several dishes in their own version.The ngoh hiang is a very big roll - it's like a 4cm diameter roll. Nice and crisp on the outside.The satay is not on skewers. Instead, it's basically slices of pork belly and then cooked in satay sauce. Beef rendang - not near the best beef rendang, I'm afraid. Can avoid. Even the color is yellowish and not brown/reddish as I would have liked it.Cendol - alot of course crushed ice. Not much coconut milk in there. Most disappointing 'dish'.Staff - It seems like the senior staff members are mostly serious-looking and engrossed in 'thinking'. You do see them around the restaurant (it is a small restaurant) and they just look very serious. The waitering staff are alright. Not all of them smile but when you do talk to them, they would reply you politely. Probably a shortfall here is the attention. As mentioned earlier, the staff in general, are standing around ... but you have to put in effort to wave a bit more just to catch their attention.Will I return? As long as I am not pressured to find a peranakan restaurant in Orchard Road area or I really wanted a strong Peranakan flavoured/decorated restaurant, I don't think I'd visit this place again

While holidaying in Singapore, we thought we should give this restaurant a try after reading all the good commends. We had the 2 for 1 deal. To our disappointment, the food was not that fantastic. Most of the dishes are bread, bread and more bread. Definitely not worth visiting. Prices are way too expensive
5
We enjoyed ourselves immensely! The food was really awesome! Infused with authentic flavour & without MSG!! The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was so welcoming! With nostalgic cutlery to grand chandelier. Great effort as decor reflects the rich flavour of the food! Executive Chef Raymond takes immense pride in his food preparation and presentation. He even took time to introduce the dishes to us! The service staff were very friendly , cheerful and ready to serve. We will definitely be back again! It was a class above the rest
5
A feast for your tastebuds and eyes !! We were greeted by the executive chef who, along with his very friendly and attentive staff, had just the right touch. Our family shared a half dozen Peranakan dishes, (a blend of Chinese and Malay styles) and every one from the soup to the durian desert was amazing. The ambience was very pleasant and interesting - sections of the restaurant showcased traditional Peranakan objects and clothing. The chef explained all of our dishes in detail, even showing us samples of the wide variety of fresh herbs used in the dishes. We felt like family, dining in the home of very charming, gracious, and gastronomically talented relatives. This will definitely be a regular stop for us every time we come to Singapore !!!!!
3
service was good, though the quality of food was disappointing. The beef rending was tough, the chendol was too sweet, flavour of chap chye was not great.
4
The food was perfect. The price is a bit steep but was justify. The omelette is too ex 15 Buck. The chendol durian is supered
4
Tried their peranakan high tea set. Taste nice for peranakan food and food served warm. The price was pricey.

We visited on 21 Aug 2017 for tea.The "basket" came with tea time items for 4.I have to mention that the decor has been meticulously thought through and designed.The items are elaborate, including the tea cups, marriage tea ceremony tea sets, the spoons & saucer sets, the waxed-paper umbrellas, the "chongkak" play set, the mirrors, the baju panjang, the peony flower design wallpaper, the carved pieces that adorn the pillars, the ornate chairs for the "private room" which is translucently veiled with curtains around, etc ... just too much to describe.Something you have to see & experience to understand.For the "seasoning-conscious", there is a reassuring sign on the table "No MSG, just plenty of old fashioned TLC".The kueh pietee came with a large peeled prawn on top.There was also a strip of toasted white bread where you spread durian pengat on.Apart from the decor, Mr Raymond Kho (whom I undersand is the owner) comes around to engage in light banter, asks about out "eats-perience".Shirley, an Executive Sous Chef, was most obliging as she explained to 2 customers the various items in the basket and regaled them with a song that described the items in the basket.Shirley also came over to our table & most happily sang us a song about the baju panjang.The experience was just great.We came away feeling great for having spent teatime at this place.Keep it up :
5
The restaurant was elaborately decorated with lots of attention to detail, providing a very nice ambience for a relaxed afternoon tea. Acoustics was good as well conducive to conversation.The executive chef greeted us at the door and talked us through the food. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.The food was tasty and authentic. The National Day promo of high tea at $24 ++ for 2 people was really value for money.I will certainly be back to try more from the a la carte menu
3
We ordered the Assam Fish Pedas (spicy sour fish head curry), tamarind squid, cucumber salad, nasi ulam, Ngoh Hiang liver and Itik Tim. With the exception of the ngoh Hiang, the dishes were average. The Nasi ulam had fish bits that were not very fresh. The cucumber salad was too tangy with a vinegar overdose and the Assam fish head was too sour. We had the same dish here previously and it tasted much better the first time. The itik Tim was bland. We offered the feedback to the restaurant but they were defensive and insisted this was how the dishes should taste. Pity. A restaurant that refuses honest feedback is one that may not last very long..
5
Very good Peranakan food at a great location! Good portion! Nice Nonya decor! Service could have been better! Should be more attentive!
1
I had heard of this restaurant through magazines and was curious to try as I am an avid fan of Peranakan cuisine hvin married the eldest son of a Peranakan couple . So I decided to patronise during lunch . Funnily the restaurant was very quiet so full attention was given to us . I went ahead to order the specials which was pie tie , ngoh Huang, chapchye, curry chicken and fries tunghoon . When the food arrived , I first noticed everything looks very brown and black .. not much color so presentation was lacking .. then I went on to try each dish and to my major disappointment , it was below average . I was constantly hoping the next dish I tried wud perk my tastebuds up but to my utter dismay , it was sorely dreadful . Even my friend asked me why I invited her here even though it's pretty put of the way from main orchard stretch . I told her I read that it was good . Well I guess now I know ...For the price I paid quality is seriously lacking . Well I hope The Peranakan will take this as a constructive feedback and start to improve their food qualit
4
Went to celebrate a birthday at the Restaurant. Service was excellent -- the waiter made the effort to banter with my Mom in Peranakan Malay and the food was very good. My only complaint is that food is somewhat pricey but given the effort and time taken to do Peranakan food well, such prices are to be expected I guess. The decor was wonderful, brought back wonderful memories. I strongly recommend this place to all or the great food and for the Peranakans amongst us, the decor and ambience.
3
The restaurant owner has taken pains to recreate the decor of a Peranakan home from yesteryear. To this true blue Peranakan, the tables, chairs and somewhat offbeat colourful decor brought back fond memories of the homes of aunts and uncles.The food is very reasonably priced but the quality could have been better. The soups were not as hot as they should have been; the Babi pongteh was not very tasty; and the desserts (apom bokwa, durian pengat) were disappointing. However beef rendang and nyonya chap chye were good and I liked the Pandan Melaka cake
4
Home cooking which reminds you of the olden days. This is my 2nd visit. My guest from China loves the food and ambience.
5
Nice place for a traditional Nonya foods. Services staff was very friendly. Food was nice. The Nonya high tea like you have a taste of different nonya dishes.
4
It is located at Orchard Road, walking distance from Orchard MRT. The restaurant has a nice Peranakan style decoration. Beef rendang is great here. Ayam Buah Keluak tastes so so. Chap Chye is too soft. Cendol does not meet my expectation. The service is good.
3
Food was not as tasteful as I would expected for peranakan food. Food was not well executed. Chilli deep fried fish does not have enough chilli in it. Squid was half cooked. And there were flies around our seating.
3
When we visited the restaurant, it seemed that the restaurant was understaffed. We need to request for few times before getting what we wanted. The food was okay, the desserts were wonderful.
5
Loving everything here! The ambience and food is great. Mee Siam and Milk Tea are my favourites. It's a pity there is no refill

Location- At Orchard Hotel mall, parking is very expensive. If you are wondering if you can claim car park at the restaurant-NoAmbience- As can be seen from the website,it's nice. Basically, the deco tells you that this is not a cheap place to dineService- the wait staff are not that good, needs to be prompted for service. To be authentic, waitress should not converse in Mandarin- this is afterall, a Peranakan restaurant.Food- We had the Tok Panjang set- nothing to rave about except that the Ayam Buah Keluak is good as the paste is smooth, chicken is tender and the buah keluak is bitter- just as it should be. Portions were very small so if you are a big eater, this will not fill you, Service is very slow. Be prepared to spend plenty of wait time for food to arrive. Food is served room temperature, and this is another negative point especially for stuff like chap chye. The Satay Babi lacks satay punch and is rather fatty. The fried fish has been in the fryer or griller for too long, overdone and extremely dry- no meat and difficult to eat unless you are someone who eats the whole fish as it is
3
Food at The Peranakan was good enough (ngoh Hiang, beef rendang, etc) but nothing special for the price we paid. we didn't really like the Hokkien noodles too much (too soggy/mushy) and while we like the colourful ambience, the restaurant was too brightly lit (too many pendant chandeliers)
4
Great back story of its Malay/Chinese/Indonesian origins but we wanted a taste explosion of spices and a great last meal in Singapore......and we got it. Fantastic chicken curry and a beautiful cabbage and mushroom stew. Wish we could have come back for more. Has been around for a year and the very welcoming Kenny at front desk will be one of the reasons we will come back one day very soon

Located at the second, one could not help but stared at the colorful decorated restaurant. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with various traditional cutlery all over the place, that one was afraid to use them for dining. This Mothers' Day weekend the restaurant would be having a special The Peranakan Set Menu of Yesteryears (S$200++ / 4pax) which consisted of the following dishes :Sup Bakwan Kepiting Rich broth of crabmeat/pork/prawn balls with bamboo shoot The meatball was juicy but one could not really taste the crabmeat and prawn in it.or Itek TimTender duck steamed with kiam chye and sour plumsAlthough there was the distinct salted mustard's taste, the soup was not too salty and the duck was quite tender.Nasi UlamA spectacular dish of rice with raw herbs, vegetables, minced fish and salted fish.The dish was served at room temperature, as it was considered a salad kind of dish.The dish was presented in a heart shape, to show the love to mother. Crunchy and savoury that one could not taste the salted fish in it.Sambal Pisang JantungBanana blossoms were used in this dish. To eat this dish, just scoop the mixture with the Bitternut cracker. The spicy, savoury and tangy taste of the mixture, balanced the bitterness of the cracker. It was a party in the mouth.Telur Goreng ChinchalokSavoury homestyle omelette with chinchalok melakaIt was a simple dish, pan fried omelette served with fermented shrimp sauce. But it tasted very appetizing. Babi AsamBraised Pork Cheeks in a Tangy Tamarind SauceThe meat was tender which soaked up the flavours rather well. Although it was asam dish, it was not too sourish.Ayam Buah KeluahA true blue peranakan dish. Stewed with chicken from great grandmaâ€™s recipe.Buah Keluah is a poisonous fruit which can be made edible by correct methods of cooking. To eat it, one had to use the tiny spoon to scoop out the mashed filling which packed in the nut. It was buttery in taste without any bitterness. The chicken which served with it was quite tender too.Udang Masak NenasThe prawns were cooked in curry with pineapple. The gravy was tangy and slightly spicy. The prawns were fat and juicy.Bittergourd Asam BusokThe dish was a rare find. There was none of the usual bitterness while retaining the distinct bitter gourd's taste and shape. The dish was served with you tiao ( deep fried dough) which one could tear it into pieces to soak up the gravy. Dessert was supposed to be Apom Bokwa Pisang but was not available. Instead we had Kueh Dadar. The skin was thin and soft, while inside was packed with juicy coconut filling

I am just going to show you what we creamed out. Food was amazing and well balanced. Highly recommend the pork and prawn. Service was also homely, like the deco!

Brought a visitor from overseas to show her Peranakan culture. Service was great and the restaurant was nice and quiet at tea time.
4
Was there with a group of colleagues from different parts of the world. The Peranakan is a great place to introduce them to Asian cuisine. Great service too!

Good experience tasting the Gila Durian spread. Interesting creations with durian and very authentic peranakan cusine.

Brought my mum here for an early Mother's Day treat and it proved to be a great decision.We had the high-tea set - something that I had been longing to try ever since spotting a photo of it posted by a friend on facebook. While many restaurants are starting to serve gimmicky food that are "instagram-worthy" but lacking in quality, taste and flavour, The Peranakan surpassed all expectations I had in all these aspects.While the high-tea set was indeed instagram-worth, it was the food that blew me away. Tasty yet unpretentious and best of all, no MSG. I particularly loved the nasi ulam istimewa - my only gripe was that it was too small a serving and it left me longing for more! :) The kueh dadar's skin was thin while the coconut inside was moist and soft - literally melted in my mouth.After our high-tea, a man came to our table and started talking to mum and me. He turned out to be the very nice owner and chef behind The Peranakan located at Claymore Connect, level 2.As we sat outside, he then asked us if we had seen the interior. When we said we hadn't, he showed us around the inside which is beautifully decorated with various peranakan furniture and memorabilia.He even gave us a sneak peek at the new section he was going to open up in 2 weeks - my mum and I were fawning over the Peranakan furniture he had acquired for this new section.He informed me that there will be a Peranakan Fair from 27 May to 17th (I think) of June so do visit them then!He also offered me a taste of their homemade prawn rolls which I bought at $18. A little pricey but worth it for good quality homemade food. He even got his staff to give us a free portion of sambal belachan that they made as he insisted that it was very shiok to dip the rolls in the chilli.I always appreciate a place where the focus is on the quality and taste of the food and the staff and owner takes personal pride in sharing their love for food with their customers.Do visit them. High tea starts at $48 for 2

Having been introduced to this delightful restaurant earlier in the day we decided to have a meal that evening. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful explaining the history of their food and what various dishes consisted of. The overall ambience was impressive with tastefully decorated walls and screens making a pleasant eating experience, well recommend

Do yourself a favor and visit this gem of a restaurant next to the Orchard Hotel. I am from the Southern US and the food and service reminded me of home. Slow cooked entrees of Pork, Chicken, Beef and Prawns with beautiful sauces (gravy). I've had 5 different dishes and all equally great. On top of that the service is top notch. Feels like your eating at someone's home. The staff are all very friendly and the Chef/Manager personally greeted me on several occasions.

I have been learning and using more acronyms since moving to Singapore last Summer, and I learnt a new acronym today: TLC = Tender Loving Care from the owner of The Peranakan Restaurant at Claymore Connect@The Orchard Hotel. They emphasize “ No MSG, but……..with TLC”, and the truth is they deliver what they promise. When I first visited The Peranakan Restaurant in early April, I was impressed by their PASSION with my own interpretation: P: Perfection, A: Attention to detail, S: Sincerity, S: Style, I: Inspiration, O: Original and N: New. The more you know about the Peranakan culture and cuisine, the more you enjoy the dining experience at this restaurant – THE PERANAKAN RESTAURANT
4
The moment you step into the restaurant, it give you a very peranakan quaint feeling. Although the food is not the best peranakan food I've had but with the pretty ambient & really good warm service staffs, the overall experience is wonderful. Their afternoon tea set is really value for money & can get to taste many types of peranakan food
4
This is a relatively new restaurant located in Claymore Connect, off Orchard Road. The restaurant is small and cosy with a wide entrance as if it is welcoming guests with open arms! The ambience is truly Peranakan and the staff were very welcoming.Menus, water and minute sambal rolls in cute rattan containers came very quickly. The menu was fairly large and there were lots of items to choose from. In the end we decided on ngoah hiang rolls, Kuay patti for entrees followed by chap chai, chicken bekerluak, Assam fish and kangkong balachan. All the dishes were very tasty and authentic but I was particularly impressed with the ngoah hiang. For dessert we shared a platter of a few nonya kuihs, all delicious.The only negative was its prices, really expensive, even for Singapore
3
Nice and good authentic peranakan food..Should try the dessert...nice durian chendol...refreshing and taste great...
5
Food was true to original Peranakan food. A definite must try for chicken curry, beef rendang is tender, kueh pie tee is fresh! Lemongrass tea is amazing!
4
Located just beside Orchard Hotel.
Good design and decoration
Friendly and efficient service, although a little bit overbearing when recommending why to order.
Food is authentic Peranakan with excellent taste;
3
Can't fault atmosphere and ambience
Super.
Expected food to be better.
Chap chai was lacking in ingredients slightly stale also .
Babi ponteh was the shocker. More bones than meat.
Otherwise Rendang was great .
5
You'll feel the Chef/ Owner passion not just the food, ambience, and also excellent hospitality from the whole team. It was well done especially we're celebrating our good friend birthday there, what a sincere and pleasant surprise! Thanks v much, we'll be back again and again.Cheers,Jason

The food was definitely one of the best that I've tried among so many peranakan food joints in Singapore! The Nasi Ulam was a complimentary sampler from the chef and a great treat because we did not expect the rice to be cold but yet so tasty! The stingray was very soft, and the ladies finger alongside the chili was really potent. One of our family's favourites, the Chap Chye, was truly tasty. It certainly contained more ingredients than the version we had previously. But the highlight of the night was my Pulut Inti dessert! The shade of blue of the glutinuous rice is really unique, and the coconut is so moist, compared to what we can find in other snack or dessert joints. We ended dinner off with their special Lemongrass Pandan tea, which was useful in balancing out the sweetness from the desserts, given that it does not contain sugar. Compliments to the executive chef, Raymond, for coming out to explain to us how the dishes were prepared. We will be back for more peranakan treats!P.S. They also feature a special menu called Gila Durian, which uses durians from the Maoshan Wang and D24 range. BIG HINT to all durian lovers
5
The Peranankan goes from strength to strength! We had dinner on day 2 of Chinese New Year and were warmly greeted by the whole team. We came for the food and were not disappointed. The salmon abalone Yu Sheng was delicious; the ayam buah keluak a firm favorite and authentic, as was the ikan goreng. The outstanding dish we had was the Ngoh Hiang, which is truly moist and packed with flavor. Made with liver, it is a large, and one portion is enough for 4.Try also the nasi ulam ( herb fried rice) ....yum!
5
Went there with 2 other colleagues. Me being a vegetarian, we were a bit sceptical if they could serve vegetarian food for me. To our suprise the exec chef was so accommodating.He actually prepared some really great vegetarian dishes. The food was great and deco is good. Have tried quiet a number of outlets in Melaka, but this seems to beat them all.Really authentic food.Great staff as well. Keep it u

Nyonya cuisine, being an unsurpassed blend of Malay and early Chinese settler cooking, can vary between more or less Malay. The Peranakan leans somewhat towards the Chinese end (the head chef is Chinese) but with an admirable mixture of the two. One of the acid tests of Nyonya cuisine is Ayam Buah Keluak (chicken cooked in a rich sauce with keluak nuts, which have a unique and indescribable flavour). Here the restaurant came up trumps, with a version that alone was well worth a visit to Singapore. The Sambal Sotong (cuttlefish in chilli) was good, but not remarkable, which was a shame, as it can be a great dish.Finally the Sambal Petai (petai beans in chilli sauce) was well balanced and tasty. I must add a note about the service which was excellent and reminiscent of an older generation of Singaporeans and Malaysians with its courtesy and individual care. For example the chef came personally to inquire how we found the meal. If you want a taste of traditional Straits' food and culture, this is the place to visit
4
This place is centrally located at Orchard Road near Somerset MRT and next to Center Point. Most of the people hand-out here are foreigners. Offered beers, Guinness, wine (alcoholic drinks) etc. There also offered Nyonya food for those who want to try besides the normal stuff. The lane is a nice place to walk to see the left over architectural too
5
I stumbled upon this place and We have been there 3 times in the last month. Last visit took some visiting business colleagues and the food and service were outstanding!!! They even customised a bunch of dishes for vegetarians and made them yummmy!!!
Definite revisit
5
Me and my partner stumbled upon this place his weekend. What a gem. Great decor, enthusiastic staff and tasty food. It was great to learn more about the Peranakan cuisine. Thank you. We'll be back.
3
The setting is good, service prompt and friendly, the boss himself is charming. The food, good for authentic Nyonya food lover, unfortunately I'm not one. Food quality and presentation are good as we ordered a set menu. Overall a good experience. The restaurant even presented a certificate to me
5
Because of the fine and delicate preparation that is needed for good nyonya cooking, peranakan restaurants aren't normally very big. However, this place seems to have overcome the odds and dishes out great authentic food to many guests with style and good service. Some dishes were better than others but in general they were good. They also have a selection of good and mid price wines
5
As you entered the restaurant, you are welcomed by a gorgeous stunning setting. The rich and colourful deco. Love at first sight. The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering authentic Peranakan food. From starters, mains, desserts to the drinks. Sharing with you my favourites : Ayam Buah Keluak, Nasi Ulam, Ngoh Hiang (both liver and prawn), Sotong Masak Asam, Nonya Chap Chye. Heavenly. Not forgetting the dessert Pulot Enti Durian. Staff are friendly and professional. Make you feel very comfortable. Christmas is coming, we decided to order their home party set for our friends and families
5
Peranakan food is something i always miss from Singapore, because it's impossible to get the spices etc and frankly, even if i have the spices, i'm not willing to do the work!Beautiful decor and a much nicer ambiance than most other Straits Chinese restaurants. Great food, and you can tell that so much effort has been put into authenticity of the dishes. Do try the drinks too, especially the soursop drink

Founded by Executive Chef Raymond Khoo in May 2016, The Peranakan Restaurant serves authentic, pain-stakingly handmade Peranakan dishes, made using his family's recipes, in an opulent setting. Having helmed several acclaimed restaurants over his 30 year career, Executive Chef Raymond Khoo was egged on by his family to come out of retirement, to start a Straits Chinese cuisine restaurant with the traditions handed down through 3 generations of Nonyas and Babas. Ambience at The Peranakan Restaurant is opulent, exuding an elegant sophistication. The brightly lit, spacious seating area is lovingly adorned with touches of Peranakan, Baba-Nyonya decor, including floral print wallpaper, vases, pots, tiffin carriers, and sturdy marble topped tables and black wooden chairs. So many chandeliers hang overhead, while batik print cushions line the comfortable booths. Simply jaw-dropping and stunning in looks, a precursor to the bold flavours of the dishes!Service at The Peranakan Restaurant is friendly, professional, and courteous. Staff are quick to greet and seat guests, and will move around to observe if guests need assistance. I note they're familiar with the menu and dishes, able to share brief descriptions, but nothing beats having Chef host you, and share the history of his family recipes. Staff attend to requests quickly, and are efficient are clearing away empty / dirty plates or tables. An above average restaurant style service, befitting of the hospitality of the Peranakans.Food at The Peranakan Restaurant is distinctly Straits Chinese cuisine, done according to traditional Peranakan / Baba-Nyonya recipes of Chef's family. Everything is pain-stakingly handmade here, and the time consuming effort to produce each dish is astounding, a testament to its traditional roots. Each heritage dish we tried was delicious, bold in flavour and really tasty. Portions are designed for communal dining of at least 3 - 4 people, remaining true to the kampong spirit of old. Prices are very affordable for the portion, quality of food, and effort to produce each dish. Budget about SGD $28 per person for a full meal here

I really love Peranakan food simply cos it's very difficult to make and requires lots of shopping for ingredients, preparation of ingredients and putting the right amount of each ingredients at the right time. My Boyfriend suggested this place as he said it may be a good find as Peranakan restaurant are not common anymore due to hard work involved in prepaying the dishes. I like their beef rendang but not the best I've tasted. Their Assam pedals fish head is not fresh though it's a generous serving of Assam sauce and lots of brinjals which I love. The sauce is a bit too sour and not spicy enough for my liking. The service of staffs are good though. Their rice is refillable so you only have to order once. The Assam sauce goes very well with the white rice. I won't go back again but it's a very good place if you want to sit in a really fancy setting restaurant with attentive staffs and to sit around Long hours as they don't chase or hurry their guests which is a plus point

I love Peranakan food and I love trying new places that serve it. Stumbled across this place in Claymore Connection when I was shopping and decided to come back the same night for dinner. They have done a great job decorating the place to capture elements of the Nonya past and the service is friendly. But it is a restaurant and there were two things that strongly influenced by rating this restaurant as poor. First is subjective. I ordered the Niang Hiau, prawn version, not liver. But what was served tasted very much like pigs liver was a main ingredient, even though it did have a few prawns inside. When I checked if possibly they had served me the liver by mistake I was assured that what I had was definitely prawn. In retrospect, I should have ordered the liver version for comparison. Suffice to say, if you are like me, and don't like the taste of liver (unless it's fois gras) then avoid this appetizer. The second thing was that the Assam Pedas Fish head, which is only half a snapper head, was not fresh. Snapper meat, when fresh, should have no taste or smell of its own. But what we were served tasted earthy and fishy (ammonia). Fortunately, the fish head is served with lots of brinjal and ladies fingers so we filled up on them and on the beef rendang. After finding two out of three dishes not that palatable we got our check and went home to have dessert.
4
We had lunch for three and enjoyed the food. Queh pie ti was no surprise. But the liver roll was good. I really liked the buah keluak and the sotong. Just order whatever has a little orchid on the menu. On a Monday, there were 3 other tables taken. We sat till 4pm. No one chased us away. The prawn rolls are not complimentary and they charged us extra. Though there were only 3 of us but they charged us for 5 towels and 5 prawn rolls. Didn't call back to quibble because the very nice older service staff uncle served us lemon grass tea to round off the meal, so it didn't amount to much more. I think it's a genuine mistake. I found the service staff very friendly and the food suits my taste buds.
5
I've always been skeptical about mall restaurants but this is an exception! Peranakan food no less! Everything from the service to the decorations to the food! Dishes definitely tasted authentic and the durian dessert was to die for! my new favourite restaurant!
5
Wonderful large space in Orchard Road. Excellent smiley waiters and waitresses. Beef rendang was out of the world. Chicken Ponteh as well. Other food also good. Certainly thinking of coming back again

@TheKuoKnowsIf you are going to use a definite article in the name of your restaurant, then you had better make sure you are the real deal. And The Peranakan is. So, it can. The decor is the first thing that you notice. It is exquisite. It actually makes it hard to focus on the food, when there is so much Peranakan paraphernalia dotted around the restaurant to admire.Top marks also goes to the waiting staff, who are on hand to help decipher the menu. Their recommendations were spot on.The Kaki Babi Pong Teh is deicious. The slow cooking of the hock pays off handsomely. It is tender enough to melt in the mouth. It also goes very well with plain boiled rice.The Ikan Goreng Sumbat Chili paired well with the pork. It added a touch of spice, without being too overpowering.The Nonya Chap Chye is a testament that eating vegetables can not only be healthy but it can actually be fun.The Peranakan is a credit to the centuries-old Straits cooking style. Here's to the next 100 years!

Our son was leaving back to London for university and had a craving for peranakan food. We decided that we'd try The Peranankan as I'd just been there a few weeks back and had waxed lyrical about their ayam buah keluah. It was a fantastic evening.The decor is pure straits Chinese; we had a lovely table at the entrance and service was attentive and really excellent. The Sambal was truly a work of art: Can just eat that with the rice!!The itek tim ( my favorite) was a clear consommÃ© and flavorful We also had the nasi ulum, chap Chye, babi pon Teh and the ayam buah keluah, all done to perfection. I'd have to recommend the ayam buah keluah.... just like how it's done at home.All this with a lovely bottle of Bass Philips 2005 Pinot noir....! They have a pretty good wine list which is well priced; spotted the Bass Philips which was excellent! Really DDMT!
4
Couldn't complement the service enough, older waiters making me feel like it was a family run restaurant where you could trust them to recommend a good meal! Indeed I ate everything the waiter recommended! The fragrant "ayam buah keluak" was something special and felt like a secret family recipe that they were proud of sharing, and rightly so! Also nice to wash this down with the buah Nona fruit juice that brought back memories of my own straits grandma
2
Service was distracted. They were dealing with a large private party and warned us in advance that the food would take more than half an hour. Fair enough. The food, however, was obviously pre-made. Beef rendang was mushy, in a pale yellow mushy gravy. The chap Chye was soggy and had the consistency of something that has been sitting in a pot for hours (not in a good way). Fried chicken was insipid - in a tasteless marinade. But thankfully it tasted as if it had been just cooked. The rice was also strangely wet and mushy. The ngoh hiang was a saving grace, generously packed with liver and crispy. But that was the only dish we tried that faintly resembled Peranakan cuisine. They also charge you for the wet towels and the little Hae bee hiam crackers that appear at the table. So be forewarned that it's not complimentary.There are much better Peranakan restaurants elsewhere in Singapore.

If you want authentic quality Peranakan food and good service, this is the place to head to. Peranakan Chinese cuisine refers to the food of the straits Chinese immigrants to the Malay peninsular and could perhaps be described as Chinese food that incorporates Malay influences in the use of spices and cooking techniques.Central to Peranakan Chinese food is a good chilli sambal and The Peranakan does this well. The house style here has a good amount of bite and saltiness. Lovely when served with fresh lime juice.What we ate:1. kueh pie tee - stewed turnip in crispy top hat pasties served with sweet black sauce and chilli. It's a dish that requires self assembly and that's part of the fun. As we were a party of two, our server helpfully arranged for a smaller portion. 2. Satay babi sum chan - tender pork belly slow cooked with nonya spices.3. Curry chicken (Ayam) istimewa4. Nonya chap chye - slow cooked cabbage, carrot and dried Chinese mushrooms 5. Nasi ulam - a cold rice dish - delicious and unusual 6. Chendol for dessert Helpfully, the menu offers descriptions of what each dish comprises and how it is prepared. So there is no need to be intimidated if you are new to this type of local cuisine.We had a lovely time chatting with the enthusiastic Chef Raymond Khoo and one of his business partners. All our servers this evening including a few charming old school "uncles" were helpful and warm. We applaud Chef Khoo's desire to keep tradition alive and for not messing around with the traditional recipes.The restaurant decor could be described as eclectic - brightly coloured batik cushions, table cloth and wallpaper, a few antique looking pieces of furniture, square coffee shop style tables and a few larger round tables with glass tops.If one thing could be improved, we would ask for the portions of steamed white rice to be a little bigger. Prices were reasonable and the portions were of a good size. We paid S$74 (US$54) for our dinner
5
I did not know what peranakan was before and went there last week on a business trip with Singaporean colleagues. The decoration is quite original, kind of a British flair with South-est asian artefacts. Crisp and chic! As a Cambodian born French citizen living in the US, I just adored the food. Fermented shrimp flavor, liver meat loaf (Ngoh Hiang), durian, you named it. The dishes are well balanced in textures too. the Kueh Pie Tee Set was one of the highlights of the meal. The service was full of kindness. Will go back once more before I leave Singapore for sure
5
Longing for authentic nonya food? Look no further then THE PERANAKAN @ Claymore Connect. The dishes were as good (almost) as mum's! The ayam buah keluak nuts were filled with smooth paste. My favourite was their babi pong teh which had a rich intense, slightly sweet flavour. Really brought back memories when mum used to make it. My sister's favourite was the ikan goreng with dark sauce and sambal. For dessert, we all fall in love with the glutinous rice with durian (compliments of our friendly chef Ray) The rich durian paste was like eating the real fruit - you could smell the "fragrance" of the durian a mile away). At the end of the meal, they served us pandan lemon grass tea - just the right drink to clear our palate. I highly recommend this place if you're lookjng for authentic nonya food. Will definitely make another visit!
4
I loved the crabmeat soup and the sting ray . The squid with star fruit is very nice too. Plus the dessert of glutinous rice with coconut n glutinous rice with durian is very yummy. Nice and very pretty decor. Like the fact that they hired some friendly uncles as service staff.
2
Visit the place last night and must say that it's a beautiful restaurant.
However the food was disappointing. It's only just ok and the portion size was shockingly small!!
Better not visit if you have a group with hearty appetites!
4
True blue peranakan cuisine, very shiok. Must have the desserts. Coming back again to try the rest of the menu.
5
Exquisite environment! High quality food! Wonderful service staff! Must try & highly recommended! Food & place with a class!

When I read in the local papers the positive reviews, I was curious but a little skeptical. After all it's the food reviewers' individual taste and comments. Going by my past experiences, some of these reviews have left a lot to be desired.This time, the experience was much better then I expected. The atmosphere and the attentive service was very old style. You are in a restaurant but it felt like a dining room at home. The food is authentic. I think these are old family recipes handed down through the generations. We had the Tok Panjang Feast, that offered a selection of Peranakan stables. For me, it was the taste of my childhood.It's always difficult to take well travelled foreign visitors out to dinner, as they have more often then not "been there and done that". Now, I have a special place that showcases a bit of our history to share with them.If you like Peranakan food or have friends visiting, a meal at the Peranakan will satisfy the palate and the pocket
4
Already visited several times within a month. Nice setting, wonderful food and amazing service. Must try Tok Panjang which gives you a different level of experience of Peranakan cusine and Nasi ulam is one and only the best in town. Dessert was heavenly especially with durian..
5
Not easy to find good Peranakan food that's not too commercialized, let alone in the heart of town. Great place to bring foreign friends or just have a family gathering. Went with my friends and will definitely bring my family back. Love the old school feel with the "uncle" service staff too. Must try - Ngoh Hiang, Itek Tim, Ayam Bua Keluak and the sticky rice dessert! Sedap

As an ignorant Caucasian Singaporean, I have always been told by my seventh generation Peranakan wife, that you cannot have a good Peranakan meal in a restaurant, it has to be home cooked. However I now know this is not always true and this new Peranakan Restaurant proves it. First the ambiance is right. It is a bit over the top with so many chandeliers and fancy mirrors, but this is complemented by the marble table tops and old fashioned bentwood chairs which give a true overall Peranakan feel. The staff also fit as they are very laid back, but under this veneer they are exceptionally efficient. So you feel that there is no rush but everything works and orders and food are efficiently delivered with a homely pleasant style that makes you feel you are dining at an old friends place rather than a Restaurant in a Singapore Hotel. It is just a perfect atmosphere. But what of the food? There are many of the old staples but there is a significant difference. The two of us started with Nasi Ulam Istimewa, a great favourite of mine but which I had only tasted at one other place in Singapore. I usually have to go to Penang to have it. The reason is because it is incredibly time consuming to make, so why is it found here and not elsewhere? The Restaurant’s proprietor, Raymond, follows his Grandmother and Godmothers recipes, which is why the food is so different here, as we were also to find with other dishes. The Ngoh Hiang was another wonderful surprise made with liver rather than pork and was the most delicious I have had. The Petai Kicap Manis was also very different. I had only had variations of sambal with Petai before, which I like but this was cooked with onions and tasted sweet. It was most surprising. My wife liked the Kaki Babi Pong Teh which, unusually, used pig’s trotters, but I prefer the usual Babi Pong Teh without so much gelatin. We rounded out this excessive meal with Chap Chye which was not different from usual, but tasty. Finally we tried a Sticky rice with Durian, another hit. Unfortunately the Restaurant being very new did not have an alcohol licence but we were told it was a week or so away. But we had a lemon grass tea we were told had been brewing for 6 hours and tasted most unusual, difficult to describe, but complemented the food. In summary, what a wonderful new down to earth, atmospheric Peranakan Restaurant serving efficiently excellent home cooked Peranakan fare in a relaxed atmosphere. We shall be back

When with my wife plus 1 Child and 2 friendto this New Peranakan Restaurant at Claymore Connect @Orchard Hotel 2nd floor .Die die must eat Starter Kuek Pie Tie & Ngoh Hiang.Veg go for Noya Chap Chye taste better than my mother cook for sure.For Soup go for Bakwan Kepiting or Itek Tim with kiam Chye with is a traditional but rare soup not found in many Peranakan Restaurant. Main course must order Ayam Buah Keluak & must try for Shiok Satay Babi Sum Chan.Assam Pedas Fish is so good that when we order was the last before Sold Out.Dessert must try Pulot Enti Durian my favourite and my wife & my love the Pulot Enti Kelapa. Staff was friendly. Food serve in generous portion good enough for 4 of us to share.Thumb up for the good service provided by the Uncles.Was told by the staff Boss was the Executive Chef with his Team of uncle & Aunty in the kitchen cook no wonder food taste so homely
5
If you are a fan of Peranakan food - this is it! I missed my mother's peranakan cooking and was wonderfully surprised to taste something so closed to home-cooked authentic peranakan food.The assam fish was so fresh , and I didn't have to pre-order for the nasi ulam. A must try is their desserts - Pengat durian & Pulot Int
5
This is my new go-to place for friends and family visiting Singapore. The decor is so pretty and the food is great. The stand out dishes are Nasi Ulam, a cold rice salad made with 6 different types of herbs, totally tantalizing! Bawan Kepiting, a rich pork bone stock, with juicy pork and crab meat balls. And Satay Babi - belly pork simmered in a rich "rempah" (marinade). Leave space for the desert. The glutinous rice with Durian is a must (for those who like durians) but there is also a grated cocunut with brown molasses version of the desert for the less adventurous. Highly recommended for those looking to try real Singapore cuisine.
