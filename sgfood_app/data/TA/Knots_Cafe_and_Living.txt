Spacious cafe with not-too-bad food and nice ambience for couples, friends and families. The service was warm and friendly.

A quiet & quaint place to enjoy your food and cuppa peacefully, in the company of indoor greenery.. aaahh..

Order the fruits, spinach salad, was really good. I was hoping to have upsize version on optional basis in the near future.
My cousin likes the signature saving waffles.
Milk tea lava would be perfect if we ca taste more tea.
Overall was good!

Pleasantly surprised to find this place for my weekend brunch fix. Food was great - i had the truffle pasta and the scrambled eggs were well cooked. Ambience was nice n cozy too!

A really cozy cafe, with not too much of a crowd. Absolutely love the food and coffee there. The staffs are attentive too.

Had the beef lasagna. It was very normal. I was politely shown to my table. The queue for food was very long. It was 1pm, the place was crowded and full of chatter.
5
Warmly welcomed with the ambience of the cafe and the decoration. Further satisfied with their delicious food. Already planning the next visit!

Ambience environment, matcha waffle standard is not up to par. Green Mussels is over spicy as appetizer.

Well if your looking for a nice cozy chill spot that is not pretentious this is a good spot, great decor ( mostly items on sale) and large tables for bigger groups! Well food wise don’t expect anything too fancy, they serve up very basic items that keeps the stomach from growling. Dessert wise they have a great selection from waffles, ice cream to cakes! However the slice of cake I had was terribly dry but the service staff were more than happy to change it for me!

They were really understaffed on a Sunday morning brunch time. Although few tables were free we had to wait 30 mins min for someone to remove plates from previous customer, then ask twice for them to clean the table. Kind of ridiculous. For the rest food was ok, not so great. I wish they could be better organized and with a proper menu. They could do SO much more from this place that have good potential. Good ideas, poor execution like a lot of “brunch” coffee place in Singapore.

The cafe is nice and chill and with amber space between tables. Went there for lunch and it’s actually quite packed. Recommend to make reservation beforehand.
5
Pleasant environment and great good! Perfect place for a date or catch-up with friend away from the crowd. Love going again and again, menu and food quality have also improved from the first visit. Awesome!

Wide variety of food - portion and taste was ok. Only provides toilet tissue paper as serviettes. Beautiful setting and ambience made up for the rest of the experience.

Came for brunch with couple of friends. Food was good and definitely recommend Knots waffle brekkie. Salted caramel latte is pretty good too. The ambience is like a living space as the name of the place said it. They have projection showing EPL matches too. Kids friendly and lots of interesting decorations.The thing that impressed me most was they hired a couple of mild physically handicap servers. Kudos to the management for opening up an opportunity for them.

Came here with my wife after splurging at the tamiya warehouse nearby. Location looks nice at first glance but when you are actually sitting down. There's too much deco going on which makes it a little too overbearing. The food prices is a little bit expensive but I guess it fits the theme of a hipster cafe. The food was average. It's a good place to drop by for photo and they even sell dec

Book through chope for a Sat lunch for 3pax, request for a corner seat. End up when reach, the seats are facing the flower freezer right at the back & meant for 2 seater instead. Overall cafe is over crowded as we can't change seats too. Dishes is being served after 30min. Our mood is not there already & truffle fries is too oily. Look like having seaweed fries instead. Waffles is super dry & over cooked. Disappointed as can't really take photo due to our seats locatio

Though food was a little on the higher side, the ambience was great. When we reached there weren't many people so eating was a good experience without having to shout across the table. Christmas vibes, lights and trees was up. Food was ok. However I saw that online it said they were selling furniture, but there weren't a specific dedicated area as shown on those food blogs. So, a bit disappointing in that aspect

Really nice interior, friendly staff!! We were there for a birthday celebration and the staffs were so accommodating to our requests. Cheerfully put our cake in the fridge and provided 15 plates for us to put slices of cake!!!! Thank you so much. Food is really good too :-

We happened to be around the area and decided to check it out. We were surprised by how busy the cafe was on Sunday afternoon!The location was around industrial & warehouses, with the nearest MRT 10 mins walking distance. There were nothing much in the same vicinity yet many people come here just for the cafe, that said something about it. We loved the ambience. Plants, Furniture & small deco items are integrated into the cafe. There is a huge screen in the front, great for catching soccer games while enjoying beers with friends.We tried teas, hot chocolates, pizza & waffles. The beverages were ok. Margarita Pizza was pretty good, thin crusts, cheesy but not salty. The Banana waffles was amazing! Waffle was charcoal black, and we have to put in some efforts to cut but really really crispy, not only exterior but inside as well. The chocolate ice cream on top of waffle was bitter sweet, and blend in well with the waffle. But the vanilla ice cream didn’t have a hint of vanilla.Overall a great place to be if you around the area, or looking for a change from Starbucks or other chain cafes or don’t mind the travel

Great place for brunch, nice ambience, nice food, good waffles, price average for a brunch, location alright with nearby MRT.

Mains were average however they do serve decent pizza and awesome lava cakes. All three flavours- chocolate, thai milk tea and matcha were equally delicious.
3
Nice ambience but staff unsure on Chope reservation so wasted some time at cashier but njce ambience
4
The interior is nice! There are a lot of plants and good atmosphere. Dishes were ok. My salmon was a bit overcooked, mush potatoes were average.

Atmosphere is very good.. Alot of plants. Feel like we are in a nature garden having our delicious dinner. Wish the menu has more variety.

The place was very quaint and I think made for an interesting place to eat as you can shop at the same time. The desserts range is quite wide so looking forward to trying it on our next visit...

An out-of-the-way location but you'll still see crowds, although not extremely crowded nor noisy. Very cosy environment, good for a relaxing time catching up with families and friends. Food is nice, cakes are nicer. Would be perfect if parking is complimentary. Will be back again!

Been here few times. always love this place, high ceiling, Great ambience, great food, great place. I hope it won't turn crowded as it is a good place for business meeting.

We came to Knots having read reviews and being fully aware that the food quality was average at best.We ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast on Waffle set. It would have been better if the bread on the Eggs Benedict was toasted, but otherwise taste was decent. The scrambled eggs on the Breakfast set wasn’t flavourful enough, but the sausage was nice. The service staff did their jobs well. We didn’t run into any of the issues mentioned by other patrons.We loved the interior design of the cafe. It was hip and refreshing.Perhaps because we came by on a weekday afternoon, it was relatively peaceful to chill out in the cafe. Seems like a hidden find and a good place to do some reading or work

Was attracted by the beautiful interior and interesting menu but was very disappointed when the food was served. The interior is cosy, like what we read online but the food and coffee/hot chocolate was at most lukewarm. The food was very oily too (from fries to eggs Benedict and Mac & Cheese).
