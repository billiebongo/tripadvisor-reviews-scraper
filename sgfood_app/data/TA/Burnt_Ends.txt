Finally after 2 months of waiting , I get to eat at the much raved Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants. True to the reviews , its an unforgettable experience of meaty pleasure. We had the degustation menu & every single dish was executed to perfection.The meat and seafood will blow your mind off. Most of the dishes may at first appear super simple are, but after diving in, deeply complex yet satisfying . Higly recommended The BURNT ENDS SANGER (pulled pork burger). It was extremely juicy and flavourful, Blackmore's Striploin. Done medium rare, it was well grilled and seasoned, and the quality of the meat was obvious. King Crab and Garlic Brown Butter , the sauce was so good that I couldn't resist to finish every single bit of it. Lastly Smoked Ice Cream, who would think that this bizarre combination would be that great . Will definitely be back here agai

Delicious food served in a friendly atmosphere by an excellent Chef and supporting staff. Once you've decided what to eat from their carefully selected menu, your meal is then cooked right in front of your eyes whilst you're attended to throughout the dining experience with simply impeccable service. Burnt Ends is definitely the place to go when staying in Singapore. Highly recommended. 5 stars

Book early and get a space at the chef's table - the 4 ton smoker behind shows they mean business.I just went with it and ordered as i ate - the quails eggs...wow... then snow crab... Loved this place, especially as a big Q fan
5
We didn’t have a reservation and joined the waiting list and it was worth it. The menu changes everyday and some of it needs explaining but everything we had was exceptional. Steak is ordered by the weight and it’s easy to ‘over order’ which we did but, because it was so good, we managed to do it justice. Doesn’t come cheap but you are left having had a fantastic experience and one which you will want to repeat.
5
After a long wait to be able to get a Reservation, we finally were able to Experience this place. Now awarded Top San Pellegrino Restaurant, is definately worth it.Staff is very easy going, relaxed but professional at the same time. Andrew is Great, he spent time talking to us. Cocktails are Amazing! just by watching the Bartender being so focused and creative about the cocktails really makes it even more appealing and a Must to order. You must try the Negroni and the Rosemary smoked coktail. Australian wine selection is also very good to paired it with the food.You can Order A la carte or the Chef’s Menu- we selected the Chef’s Menu that was worth it really. Chef Kellie came to ask how Hungry we were and prepared nice dishes together with his Team. Is nice to see the open kitchen and the Oven. Is a Must try- Restaurant
5
Fantastic atmosphere and truely delicious food we were a party of 4 nearly ordered one of everything off the menu. Except for all the steaks. A real show by the chefs but the proof was really in the food. Good work to the chefs!!! We ate at lunch and my sister booked a few months in advance. For dinner a booking in advance is the only way you will get a seat. This restaurant is a must do when visiting Singapore

We dine here twice and it’s actually quite pricey cos the portions are small especially their tapas.The good stuff- beef marmalade - cube role tender....tender, fatty & beefy taste selling @ $50/100g ( it Wagyu ribeye that’s why is on the pricey side)- burrata fennel orange ....nice marriage of flavours The ok stuff-Sanger pull pork burger is normal... quite dry.. look across the street they have better burgers- Onglet .... is cheaper cut off meat and it shows - Sourdough bread should have be toasted/burnt more but it was not crispy .....was actually looking forward to this cos Restaurant André serve us sourdough which they told us they got it from Burnt Ends and it was really crispy with soft middle and flavourfulThe won’t order it again stuff- quail egg with caviar not worth the money - Jamaica chicken .. it’s 2 tiny pieces and meat looks like is from the wing joint area.Probably good idea to asked them for their recommended / signature dishes and splash your dough on those
5
We had Burnt Ends on our to do list as soon as we decided to travel to Singapore, recently voted 10/50 in Asia & 53/100 in the World. We sat at the counter right in front of the open kitchen, the theatre of which adds so much to the nights experience. We chose the "Chef`s Select" and every single mouthful of the dishes that arrived were outstanding. One of the most memorable meals of our lives, thank you Dave,Jake and staff
5
Nice ambiance . Products/ dishes changed very often. Among Blockbusters are onglet , crab , burned butter leeks , Sanger. All product cooked with perfection and love . The chief Dave is a passionate and always available to explain the food. Can dine in until late . Burnt ends is like family for me and my fiancée . We feel always good in that restaurant .
5
This review is slightly late but I booked the Chefs table last year (May) for my birthday having been to the restaurant a few times.We had a fantastic time, the food was sublime, the wine went down a little too easily and Dave and all of the staff were excellent. Without doubt this was probably the best bday I have had in a long time. We booked the table for 6 adults as we thought the min cost for bringing two children was a little high but Dave was really good and said that if ever come again he would have no issue in the kids just ordering off the menu. Many thanks for a great bday guys

I was hungry i needed a good eat. my son a connoisseur of sorts promised me the best steak in Singapore and took me to Burnt Ends. a functional Australian Steak eatery.he ordered a fairly large 700 gm piece of beef and asked it to be served medium rare without any accompaniments.The steak came sizzling hot with some black bean sauce (which neither of us touched).The meat was juicy, succulent and full of happiness.did not need any wine or cocktail to sip no aperitif and to keep the happy taste no digestif either.What a steak...burnt to a perfection
5
Sitting at the counter or at a table gives you similar experiences however at the counter the interaction with the chefs is wonderful. The food is creative and tasty and service team is knowledgeable and professional. I prefer it for lunch, long lunch... Definitely a must try. Great people behind it clearly
4
Dining at the bar counter overlooking the kitchen crew making magic was delightful. Jake was friendly and charming and his mate managing the bar was awesome. I enjoyed the meat dishes but I thought the bone marrow dish was very unappealing. Burnt Ends is wonderful but I cannot explain the long reservation list (we had to reserve 3 months in advance) and I do not think it is value for money ($200/person). If the price is slightly lesser, I would say this place is perfect
4
this place is a restaurant for casual dining, not to be mis-understood for elegant / classy simply due to the Michelin awarded.for the char-grilled food restaurant, this place serves v nice food, especially the beef!atmosphere was casual and vibrant, good place to hang with friends.with majority of seats being on long bench, i would suggest go with party no more than 3 pax.observing food-making and cooking in close distance, one would appreciate the attention to details and consistency in cooking.the description on "casual" is on the dining and atmosphere, but not on the pricing
4
Well we were really positively surprised since we were passing by only to have a beer and snacks. We saw some dishes from other clients and we've started to order too. Well the portions are small but the food is fantasticly tasty and delicious. We've asked also beef and quail and it was awesome. Inside the restaurant was full and staff are really kind. I recommend and I would surely go again.
5
We found this restaurant through the Lonely Planet guide to Singapore so we arrived with no preconceived ideas. By the time we arrived the place was already fully booked but there was space outside on a share table. The waiter suggested an entrée which turned out to be beef on a small piece of toast. It was adventure for the taste buds and set the tone for the night. My partner and I both had the pulled pork Sanga followed by beautiful deserts. This is not a cheap restaurant but for a special occasion or great place to go out while on holiday, I would highly recommend this establishment
5
The restaurant was recommended by a friend. I was initially in two minds. Why would an Australian go to a BBQ restaurant? It turns out this is no ordinary BBQ. The kitchen is a multitude of BBQ's and devices for plating up delectable treats. Executive Chef David Pynt was away cooking in the Maldives (lucky him!) but the kitchen was in good hands under the watchful eye of Head Chef Jake Kellie. Watching the team work - perfectionists who clearly love their jobs was a real treat. The menu on the night we attended included some of the favourites - every dish was carefully prepared. The sanger is really a rockstar dish, juicy and flavorsome. My only criticism - I filled up on this generous dish and ran out of space for some of the mains. I had the glorious onglet but next time it would be worth coming with a group and getting one of the big meat dishes. The surprise of the night? Garlic shoots and gremolata.Bookings have to be made early - it is poular and a small place - but if you are going to Singapore you should give it a shot
4
It's one of those restaurants where you have to wait 2-3 months to get a reservation, unless you walk-in in which case it's a 2 hours wait.We went for lunch after booking the place 2 months before. The food was worth it. The establishment itself is very small with mostly counter seat and very few tables. Bu the food is worth talking about.Be them the appetizers or the mains (we had flank steak with bone marrow garnish), it was scrumptious. Their specialty pulled pork bagel was their special creation that is unmissable.Revisit Likelihood : Good, but need to plan ahead
4
Everything is on fire or smoke, except the beers and wines. We actually had some difficulties to decide for our menu and the waiter kept asking every other minute, but in the end we ordered several dishes course by course. This was really the best way to get through it and we went from one highlight to the other. The fish head was delicious as was my steak cut and the bone marrow bun!The downside: the „table“ opposite of the kitchen is hardly large enough for the plate.
5
What a wonderful place! We decided to splurge for my birthday, and boy did we make a good choice in choosing Burnt Ends. Slightly frustrating, is that the venue does not accept reservations for times after 6:30PM, so you need to commit to eating early, or arriving early to secure your place with kitchen view. The service was great, the waiters seemed to work flawlessly as a team. The food was beautifully crafted, and absolutely delectable. We shared 2 bite-sized dishes, 2 appetizers, and 220g of arguably the most amazing meat I've ever eaten! Do yourself a favor and go here, even if it might make a dent in your budget :
5
Went out of my way to try Burnt Ends and was not disappointed at all! The rump with bone marrow sauce was incredible!
Sat at the bar facing the kitchen. Amazing meal!
Would definitely go back.

This is probably one of the best restaurants in Singapore, although I not really understand the hype around it . . . They certainly do a very good job at marketing themselves . . . I was having dinner all by myself, sitting at the counter. The mixologist prepared an outstanding Negroni . . . however, the wine list - if you go for wine-by-the-glass, is very limited.The food was outstanding!!! Really. Loved every dish, and it was my third visit to Burnt Ends
2
A reservation wait list for 2 months and being named in some of the most respected food guides builds up the anticipation of dining at Burnt Ends. Unfortunately, when the fated day arrived, I was sorely disappointed. The decor is inspired by Tokyo's sushi houses or tempura counters wherein everyone sits on one straight counter, facing the open kitchen. However, what works for hand rolled sushi, fails in a barbeque restaurant where patrons cough as the smoke drifts towards them. The chairs are so close together that it matters not whether you go solo or with company, you'll be pretty much eating alone.The food is not bad. But in my opinion, highly overrated. I went for the sanger which is said to be the best in town, I claim I vehemently disagree with. The service however, is attentive, though a tad bit snobbish. When I placed my order of a sanger and a mocktail, I was almost looked down upon, as if a bill of $38 was pittance. The experience was so uncomfortable, that I left quickly, skipping the pie that I had been eyeing for dessert. Having said that, watching chefs create and plate your food is something right out of MasterChef, the one part that I did enjoy
5
Had the PDR at level 3 for a table of 6.Great service by the young australian manager with the beard (had to be!)super knowledgeable about food and wine.unpretentious great tasting food that had the signature smoky taste (why else.. burnt ends)the main of the 250+ menu was the 45 day aged tomahawk. sublime.missed the vibe downstairs but later go to see it before we lef
5
It was a wow! I'm still thinking about it. The venue is quirky, service good and good jus fabulous. We had loads of dishes and so many of them were just the best. Crostini was good, meat with jam was fantastic, beef tar tar with caviar-wonderful....the wine was perfectly matched with all the dishes. Dinner was quite expensive but so worth it. Highly recommend it if you can get a table as people book weeks if not months in advance

We were a group of 9 for a business lunch. We arrived ahead of our clients and explained that we were going to order right away as we did not have a ton of time.  I had to leave at 1:45 to get back to the office - by this time we only had a few appetisers. I will say they were all delicious. The rest of the party had to leave by 2:30 still no mains. We had to let out clients take them in takeaway boxes. When one of my colleagues complained they told him we bring you the food when we think your ready. I mean common who takes a 3 hour lunch during the week. They did provide a small discount on the bill. But still ended up paying 1900 SGD for a meal where 4 of us did not eat any mains not to mention it was embarrassing in front of our clients. Would I give them a second chance maybe only because the food was very good - what I ate anyway.

Brilliant chef Jake Kelly his assistant ( forgot her name ) see pic and his team - amazing innovative fresh food, hospitable team, great atmosphere.A Modern Australian Barbeque offering casual dining with seating at countertop table looking directly into the open kitchen.The custom built four tonne, dual cavity ovens and three elevation grills bring a new and exciting dining experience to Singapore.If you are looking for a unique barbequeexperience, they love to see you down here
4
We decided to allow the Chef to surprise us this evening with a flow of unique dishes. Generally impressed with several aged beef dishes including tacos, on toast and seared. The leek was a good composition well balanced with hazelnuts and was my favourite. The main dessert was rather average but enjoyed the marshmallow and dark chocolate with soft butterscotch center. Wine selections were rather limited for ordering by glass and only Australian wines. We were seated by the bar counter and enjoyed the cocktail making show. Wasn't up to my expectations after a rather big hype by my partner.
5
We went for lunch. PS. only Friday and Saturday served lunch. We have a infant, so my daughter was sat on my lap the whole lunch but didnâ€™t bother us to enjoy the food there! If you want to sit in front of the kitchen you must book it in advance! Really good food and good service, not expensive! Must try when you visit Singapore and tired about chicken rice
5
Exceptional lunch as I passed through Singapore, unique in every way. The food, service, ambience, view of the chefs preparing all make for an unforgettable dining exprerience. I have eaten in a few places and had a few things to drink but this is in the top 5 ever!! Thank you Dylan and the team at Burnt Ends. I will be backStuar

Yes, it is expensive, but yes, it is Singapore, we’re almost everything is expensive.Beside the meats, were it’s all about in this place and which are top-notch and expertly cooked, they offer nice, tasty and surprising sides.Wines are expensive (80 euro and -far- up), but equally good quality.Not really suited for groups, as you are seated at a bar, there is only one table, minimum of 6 people, and it is difficult enough to get a reservation for the barstools, let alone this table. (Reservation, 6.30 only, starts 3 months in advance, and you better be on the phone right then). Surprisingly, you’ll have a chance walking in later on the evening if you’re willing to wait 45 minutes or so
4
I was unsure how to rate this place. You have to reserve way in advance unless you turn up as it opens and get one of the 6 bar seats that are kept free for walk ins (or you queue or wait for the same). The food is certainly very tasty and well prepared, even if the portion sizes are a bit small. I guess for me, the sticking point is that it's rustic and the food is good, but the portion sizes are small, it's pricey, and it's also very, very packed. They have tried to get many seats into a very small venue. I think by trying to mix too many concepts, it just doesn't manage to carry any one of the off excellently, which is a shame. It's worth giving it a try, but I do think there are probably better places to eat in Singapore.

Recently went for a work celebration with 10 colleagues and had the private dining room upstairs.We had a set menu for 180++ pp, which provided 5 or so starters, 2 mains and 2 deserts. The starters were very good, with every one tasty and well seasoned. However, the mains consisted of two large plates, one steak and one suckling pig, to share between all of us. The steak was decent but the suckling pig pretty lacking for so many people. We only had a small bite each if lucky. These were served with no side dishes and no sauce. Which for the money u pay is pretty disappointing. The deserts were nice, although the smoked ice-cream in the 2nd was a little overpowering. The wine list was very good but also very expensive. 200-300% above retail on some of the wines. Which seems far higher than it really needs to be, especially when the food is already at a premium.Not in a rush to go back, which is a shame
5
From the time we step foot into the restaurant, the staff could not have been more welcoming. Our table as not quite ready when we first arrived, but offered us a drink menu while we waited. After less than 5 minutes our table was ready . The food selection was mind blowing, with the chef explaining what each dish was as it was served My wife and I could not have asked for a nicer meal on our honeymoon. Thank you to all the staff for their amazing customer service
5
Made a reservation a couple of months in advance for dinner during the week of our stay in Singapore. We arrived a little early and got seated right away at a table rather than on the bar counter (which was better in my opinion). We ordered a handful of different items and nothing disappointed! The quick bites all came pretty fast, but the steak was about a 30 minute wait from the time we finished our last course. The beef marmalade is a must order! Super tender and delicious!The steak was cut thinly and cooked to perfection. Since we were there for our wedding anniversary, the restaurant gave us 2 marshmallows on the house for dessert. Service was excellent. It was interesting seeing so many employees (both in the kitchen and out) in the restaurant all working together to deliver an efficient dinner service to the guests
5
My partner and I came here for dinner at about 6:30, when we arrived the place was pretty full already, but we got a great counter seat in front of the action of the kitchen.I would really only recommend this for groups of 2 or 3 at the most, if you're at the counter it's hard to converse to your group properly if you had 4+ people (unless you go the chefs table).The food is fantastic (see pics).The person serving us was very knowledgeable of the menu and able to answer any question we had.We were in Singapore from holiday from Australia, so maybe we're not as spoilt for choice as Singaporeans are, but this was one of the best meals I've ever had
1
Overly-hyped. Over-priced.Too cramped. Too Noisy. Too oily. Too salty.Service gets slower and slower as the restaurant fills up.Our last dish came out 20 mins after the rest of our dishes came, and miraculously it came after we asked for the bill! Not cool.Don't bother with the Jamaica Chicken - it's as if they ran out ingredients and use one of the cheapest cut of the chicken. At $10 for a wee portion of chicken wing, it's daylight robbery! ... and even that, it was nothing to shout about
4
This is one of the 'in' places in singapore right now. Busy as, with a little spill over outside the entrance. No chance of just walking in. Need to book. Wine is pretty pricey 90 to 180 sing per bottle and beers ( none local at all ) are priced as though they shipped them from Oz. Splashed over $500 for two by letting the owner 'suggest' a menu. A few items were not on the menu and the wagyu and chip was $70 sing for the two. That's an expensive tapas mouthful. The taste sensations and the experience is excellent and the crowd is a broad cross section from older couples to hipsters.
4
We ordered the 1) Quail's Egg with Caviar ($15 for one, really tiny) 2) Squid ($18) 3) Parfait Tartlets (abt $12 for 2? Ard there) 4) Pork belly with apple and raspberry sauce (abt $25?) 5) Skirt steak 170g ($26 per 100g) and 6) Butterhead lettuce ($6????????!!!!!!)The quail's egg was unique in that the white was hard but the yolk was runny. So there was an "explosion" in my mouth when I bit into the egg. But at $15 it's super pricey (maybe it's because of the caviar). I don't think the caviar enhanced the experience so if I could order this without the caviar, I would. The parfait tartlet was a little weird. The waitress said that it had dark chocolate, raspberry, duck liver, salt, sugar and torched. Something like that... and the tart pastry wasn't very good. The rest were pretty good. There wasn't the onglet and marshmallow when I was there so I couldn't try that. I wished I had tried the pork sanger though. Maybe next time on deliveroo as it's probably not a place I'll return to. Once is good enough for me.
4
Ate here for lunch. A lot of the seating inside were taken so we decided to eat in the bar outside. The restaurant is near Outram Park MRT. Excellent service, menu is limited. The drink menu has a lot of choices. For starters we got the Garlic Shoots and Gremolata, a light appetizer with a very tasty gremolata. Very good.Next we got their version of a Pulled Pork sandwich. A very good serving of pulled pork with some zesty cabbage on a tasty brioche bun. Addicting.For the main, we got the Onglet, which had a bone marrow sauce and bone marrow on top of the meat. Really tender and good.Nice place, friendly staff too. Spent around $84 SGD.Good stuff right here

Burnt Ends is a casual, fun, interactive restaurant serving outstanding food. They have nailed it, quality produce handled with care and respect. Dave Pynt and his team are innovative and are at the forefront of the Singapore restaurant scene.
Thanks for a fantastic Birthday.

This is a piece of Australian class in Singapore. The food was familiar but so different at the same time. Service was spot on, the dinning experience of the stay. It's a must
5
Honestly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Friendly service and exceptional food - I would go back to Singapore just to eat here.

I booked this restaurant that needs advance booking for at least 3 months in June. However, forgot to place credit card to secure the seat and hence I showed up at 640pm with no more seats and has to wait till 830pm seating. Waiter has patiently provided me option to see outside if I would like wiggle waiting for the seat inside. We decided to sit outside and started our first dining experience ! We chided Chef menu and around 730, waiter gave us the counter seats with perfect view! It was great. Ordered Australian wine being this is the Australia cuisine restaurant, beef sort undercooked and tasted too raw similar to my aged Pigeon. However when we asked to burn some more fire in to the meats, they so happy to do for us without words. Splendid! The Chef is young and energetic, the counter seat can see the whole action took place in the restaurant. Very Creative of some of the BBQ stuff like BBQ corn, caviar on seafood over toasted bread! Melt in the mouth and out of the world... enjoy but do remember to book earlier and place your credit card to Ensure seat confirmation. You will receive email of confirmation right after and another email reminder a day before

I had high expectations for Burnt Ends, given its awards and rave reviews. However I was quite disappointed. The food was ok, but not great. The starters we ordered were underwhelming. The burger was good. The steak was good but definitely not worth the price ($55 for 100 g).The service was below average among restaurants in Singapore with a similar price tag. The first waiter that served us was really bad. We asked "What's your specialty here" and he answered something like "Everything is our specialty. Everything is good. Trust me". That was very unhelpful. I had to talk to other waiters to get information on the dishes. He was also a bit pushy and impatient.And I don't like it's reservation system. Three-month advanced reservation for a dinner table is just ridiculous
5
Went there last night with my friend. The place is small but for me is good. They have 2 high counter tables outside the restaurant and when you walk inside you will see the long counter for eating so guest will face to the kitchen this one is good for the foodie who like to see the chef in action. I like the design and ambience. For the food we have chef table menu every dishes that came out very creative I like every dishes. For the main course we have suckling pig, steak and Tomahawk they all well seasoning and good quality. For me I preferred all the appetisers. I saw they have a good selection for cocktail too. I would recommend this place if you are a meat eater. For the price point it is on the high side but these all come with the quality and creative of the chef. Lastly service was very good, very attentive and knowledgeable about their products too
5
We had lunch here after a week in Singapore. This is a world class restaurant. It could be anywhere, but was probably my favourite place in Singapore. Food is outstanding, I love sitting at the BBQ watching the action and the service was good, We discovered that Singapore service seems to be all about getting you in and out as quickly as possible - hello Candlenut, Michelin starred and we were done within an hour. Burnt Ends got the pacing just right. I honestly can't fault anything here. It's pricey, but worth it. Go if you want great food, wine and theatre.

Eating burnt food at Burnt Ends will give you CANCER 508602939 The website for making reservations is TOTALLY user unfriendly and no one even answers the phone!!! I left 8 messages on the voice mail and NOBODY called back! Appalling and deplorable ! They want credit card details so they will charge you S $100 for no show or cancellation without a minimum of 6 hours notice before the time of the meal. On the user-unfriendly and over-complicated website they state you must make reservations 3 months in advance...What the hell! Such arrogance is abominable!I found out THAT THE PLACE IS LIKE A HOLE IN THE WALL WITH very FEW SEATS AND CRAMPED SEATING! Actually burnt ends of barbecued meat are full of cancer causing pyrolic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines and other poisonpous chemicals, very well researched and documented. On the website on 2 Aug 2017 there was an availability for 6 persons on 4 Oct 2017 at the bar seats, which they make you tick a box to say that you know they face away from the kitchen, and after trying so very hard to book, I suddenly get a message on 3 Aug saying there is now no availability and apologies for the late reply. PATHETIC AND INSUFFERABLE! DEPLORABLE! Such arrogance and a terrible attitude which makes you think that they are so deluded they think they are the only restaurant in Singapore. As an INternational Travel, Food and Wine Writer/Editor/International Wine Judge, I KNOW that there are so many BETTER restaurants in Singapore
5
Staff were lovely, sitting at the long bench was sociable, food delicious and great to see the food being cooked and cocktails made. It was a short walk from the Dorsett, had a real buzz and was perfect for me as a first- time visitor to Singapore.Book in advance as it's popular, but don't be put off if you can't as they will text you when there's a space
4
We visited on a Saturday night. Our group of four unfortunately could only get bar seats inside (after a three month reservation). The bar unfortunately faces the wall so it isn't good for a big group as you can't speak to each other and you can't see any of the kitchen action. Also the seats were extremely uncomfortable and I kept getting knocked by people walking by. So beware of the bar seats when making a booking. The pluses:- wine list was superb. Many rare Australian wines which you can't find and buy. - food is fresh. We tried the pulled pork Sanger which was excellent, leek and hazelnut, beef marmalade, taramasalata, Alaskan crab legs and beef onglet. Minuses:- the food is very rich and sinful (full of butter) particularly the crab legs and beef. So no good for your diet!This restaurant definitely takes Australian BBQ to the next level! The wine was not cheap but we thought the rest of the meal was reasonably good value. Worth trying if you can get in
5
I had a good dining experience at burnt end . All the dished that I order was amazing . My flavourite is the onglet . Highly recommended to visit .
5
Absolutely superb food. I love the layout of the olCe as you sit along a bar like table watching the chefs as they roast, toss, whisk, beat, stir fry or whatever else a chef does. You can see your meal being prepared in front of your eyes. They use a blow torch to do the Jamaican Chicken!It is not cheap, far from It, but you get what you pay for with absolutely delicious food and a cracking vibe.
5
I've only ever experienced the amazing in Burnt Ends. Every dish outstanding, delicious, and oh so moreish. Steak, lamb, pork - cuts dependent upon the time of year and availability - are the big ticket items and you will not be disappointed, whether you go for an onglet or a more show stopping t-bone, or 45 day aged rib, just don't forget the smaller support players.Stand out dishes is a line up of the extraordinary include: leek and hazelnut, kingfish head, fennel burrata and orange, lettuce and vinaigrette, bone marrow on toast... I'm craving this restaurant as I write this.The menu changes frequently, but don't be disappointed if reviewed dishes aren't there. I can promise from visiting several times that it's all good, all the time.You can't book, so arrive early, leave your name and head round the corner to one of the many excellent KeongSiak road bars. Burnt Ends is worth the wait
5
That is how guests are treated and how dishes are prepared for you. Specially done one by one. This is my first dining experience in Singapore that I find truly interesting for the following reasons:1) we were seated right next to the cooking area for us to appreciate the kitchen activities (the experience was not between you and your companion, but rather you and the kitchen and the chefs, 2) the menu is dated for the day, meaning it changes on a daily basis, and,3) chef proposed to serve a course which isn't on the menu for the day, for that "surprise me" experience Food quality is superb, while service is warm and attentive. Maybe these are the reasons for the long waiting time when you try to book for a dinner reservation. You may not believe it, but waiting time can be as long as 3 months. I recommend the ff:- Smoked quail egg caviar - Grissini and taramasala- Jamaican chicken- Eggplant tempura- crab topped with black truffle, and served with bread (simply awesome dish), - Sanger - one of the specialities of the house (made of pulled pork, chili in mayo dressing, soft bun). One good complement is red Australian wine. As mentioned earlier, the service is personalized. The head waiter / kitchen supervisor / wine waiter knows how to explain each dish. The head chef Dave is able to establish rapport right from the start. He runs his kitchen without pressure. In summary, I was delighted to dine here. Be prepared to shell out more than usual. This is a special dining place.

No pictures to accompany this review, this was a night spent concentrating on OUR experience with the food.This turned out to be a great one.The menu presented to us had us unsure on what to order, this was our only chance to eat here and we didn't want to miss out on anything, so we went the 'chef's choice' menu.What followed was a brilliant 2hr food experience, made so by great presentation and a unique take on how food can be treated.Staff were attentive and helpful, chef was on song.Should you choose to come here, you won't be disappointed, just leave the camera in your bag

My son and new daughter in law were on their way home from honeymoon so we thought we would let the chef do the selection. The chef duly came out, offered no real ideas and then disappeared. Dishes then started to come out carefully chosen to be the most expensive offerings - try 140 dollars for four pieces of tartare the size of a sushi. When they ran out of ideas for expensive starters we came to their idea of the beef course. 320 grams of steak between 4 of us! By the time we had ordered more meet to make it a real meal the bill was beyond the top menu estimate. We were the burnt ends.The food is good if not exceptional and I am sure judicious picking can yield an excellent meal for a fair price but I object to the careful effort to rip off trusting clients

Burnt ends is a dream. It's fine dining with all the soul and none of the fussiness. We knew we were in for a treat the moment we stepped in and the smell of grilling meat wafted past us. We left our menu choice to the Chef who indulged us with king crab, onglet, quail egg, garlic shoots, egg plant, steak tartare on hash brown and the amazing "beef marmalade". It was very reasonably priced for the quality. Almost every dish came out perfect. The sauces were decadent - service staff helpfully provided hunks of sourdough bread when they overheard us whispering how much we wanted to finish the drippings on the plate. The hostess and the wait staff were very pleasant. The only problem with Burnt Ends is that it takes ages to get a reservation. And they only offer 6pm and 6.30pm reservation times. You'll have to try your luck and put your name down at the restaurant if you want to score a second seating.

We were lucky enough to get a table without reservation - and I have heard that it's almost impossible. Sat down and the service staff was so enthusiastic to tell us about their food - even made me excited! We had the onglet and bone marrow as starter, then I had their daily special for the main - Canadian lobster. Each dish was absolute perfection - cooked just right, not one min more or one min less. I can actually use the word "beautiful" to describe there food - both the presentation AND the quality as well as skill of the dishes.

Best dishes - onglet, beef marmalade, burnt leeks, sanger, sugar cake.The flavors are heavy and rich, which is what I like. Very tasty food.The quality of cooking and taste of food has been good and largely consistent the 3-4 times I've been here. That said, the last time I was here, the leeks weren't quite as buttery and melty (perhaps a tad undercooked).Service is wonderfully attentive and warm.Wait can be long but also arbitrary. We've gone at 8.30pm on a week day and were told a seat for 2 would only be available around 11pm however something opened up by 9.15pm. They do take your number down and will call once your seats are ready. Good thing there are a number of nearby establishments you can sit for a drink while you wait.For the best experience, be prepared to spend when you dine here. Stricly speaking, "value" is probably questionable - the markup on steaks here is a large multiple (the butchery at Culina sells onglet for around $5/100g while Burnt Ends charges over $20/100g). However you really can't think that way if you want to dine out. I'm sure rent is a large component of their cost.An item that I believe is always available (regardless if it's written on the menu) is their "steak frites" which is caviar on beef tartare on a crispy layered potato cake. It is very expensive for a tiny bite. (they meticulously weigh each portion of steak before very finely hand mincing). I think the crispy layered potato cake underneath is much more interesting than the rather bland tartare on top

From Memory the cheapest wine by the Glass was $26, while waiting for a seat they give you the wine list. Edited the menu so this is clearly there angle, we had a bottle of beer each at $14.To the food it's pricey, small portions but yummy, if you go here hungry you will spend a fortune! We shared the beef marmalade starter and then had a lamb Kebab and a 290 Gram Rump.Everything tasted great, portion size is more large Tapa than individual portions and they recommend Sharing. The waiter suggested 5 dishes as the norm with a combo of starters entrees and mains.Heavily meat focused with no sides don't go here if you are a vegetarian.A nice and rare thing is that service is not included, but saying that we left a tip the staff were very helpful.You cannot book a table after 6.30 and try not to get the bar table this is. Ramped and you can't see the open kitchenIncluding a tip it was $140 with 2 beers and no water, expensive yes worth it yes but if you added two more courses which you kind of need a a bottle of wine you ain't getting change from $300

We were going on holiday and planning to stay in Singapore for 3 days .My boyfriend found The Burnt Ends online and it seemed really interesting so we decided to try it out . ( he is a chef so we try a high end restaurant in every holiday we go for )The time was very short as they are closed for Sunday and Monday so we had only Saturday to go . We tried to book online but there was no availability for the following 3 month , so we decided to try just by walking in maybe they had some cancellations. Lucky we , they had one table for lunch :) A very friendly lady Sheena was welcoming us and took us to our seats . She was amazing during the whole lunch ,do not ever remember when we have received service like that last time . ( we are dining out a lot in London ) . She explained everything than took our order. We decided to go for the tasting menu selected by the chef. Chef Jake came over , greeted us and found out what our dietaries and how hungry we are . Amazing , felt like he is cooking only for us :) Than the food started to arrive by very friendly staff , and concrete explanation of the dish . The food was amazing , brilliant presentation and gorgeous flavours . Speechless.... Ohh and the cocktails we had was just the icing on the cake .The beef marmalade was one of the best and the quail egg .... yam yam . I would highly recommend for everyone, it's a must try place . Thank you for Chef Jake , Sheena and the whole staff for our unforgettable experience!

Went to Burnt Ends on a recommendation from Andre, who has a wonderful restaurant.We loved sitting at the Kitchen 'Bar' and watching the hustle and coordination of the team.However, the best part was the food. The lamb skewer, BBQ Pork sliders and Steak were awesome.Highly recommend i
5
Long wait long long long time no one picks up their phone or answers their email but once you get the reservation- they are exactly the best food. Decor not so good. too tiny space. Hope they find a bigger space and fit us all in. Overall fantastic food

It was hard getting a booking which suits of our schedule. After much ado, we managed to secure a Friday nite slot for 2 at a high table facing a wall. The place was small and so I can understand why there is a need to squeeze everyone in the best manner possible, even if it means some would have to face the wall throughout their meal. Luckily for us, the place for busy and has an exciting ambience about it. The wait staff were also very friendly which makes dining with a wall before us a tad more bearable, me thinks!So we ordered the grissini and tamarasalata, the beef marmalade and pickles, garlic shoots & gremolata, burnt ends' Sanger, leek hazlenut & brown butter as well as the kingfish head, miso & lemongrass. We also ordered a bottle of sake and 2 beers to go along with the food.The Sanger was essentially a burger. Loved it though it filled our tummy very quickly! The kingfish head was very fresh and we enjoyed eating it wrap-styled. The veges were well prepared and we tucked in everything without a single thought towards the wall before us. Instead, we turned to face each other whilst eating and ended up not exacting having to stare at the bare wall....By then, the place was buzzing with people. There is indeed a character about the place. The food certainly made it worth our while and the long wait it took to secure two seats that matched our schedule.For dessert, we had the sugar cake with smoke ice cream. It was alright but did not wow. Incidentally, we managed to secure another booking in a few weeks' time but this time, it will be at the bar counter which overlooks the kitchen. Hopefully, the experience will be an even better one. I for one am certainly looking forward to it.

Great atmosphere, very friendly staff and just delicious food. The menu is fresh with interesting mixes of food in a tapas form. The main courses are the meats of your choice. Just very yummy. Not cheap by any means ! Wine list is good and varied , again drinking in Singapore full stop is expensive. So don't be surprised at the bill !. Highly recommend a visit , cool and casual but up market ! . Must book in advanc

It took us 3 years to go to this place as it does not take reservation. Which means you may have to queue quite some time. Also the place is very small, packed and tables are very close to each other. I wouldn t recommend the place for an anniversary dinner or if you want to spend some long time at the restaurant.On the food side, it is very interesting: inventive and very tasteful. Whether it is the meat or the vegetables, everything was really delicious.The meat particularly was really splendid and in the very best I have ever had. Bravo.Overall, I would say it is definitely worth a try for the food which is really nice. But the overall experience could be better (location, set up, waiting time,...
5
Amazing experience- exceptional service, food and atmosphere. Couldn't recommend it enough. We called in advance to notify the restaurant that I was a vegan, and if they could prepare anything or recommend anything for me (other 2 guests were still meat-eaters). They could not have been more attentive and changed several items on the menu to be vegan-friendly, and were happy to do so! I had the best time and enjoyed it thoroughly. Both meat-eaters also said they loved it, and we have already made another reservation for a few weeks away. Definitely need to book in advance. We loved how passionate the staff were and how much they knew about their Alcohol and ingredients. It was so cool to watch a talented mixologist work just infront of us. Cant wait to go back
5
Being the top 50 restaurants in Asia, it is definitely a place not to be missed. Couldn't get a reservation online and decided to queue at 5.30pm for dinner on Friday night. We were very lucky to get a seat inside. Thanks to the great staff. A restaurant that is full of life, all the chef and staff were working non stop when it opened its door for dinner. We had couple of beef dish, kingfish, salad and bone marrow butter bun. All were good except the bun which I found it too oily and rich for my liking
5
Finally got to eat at this famed restaurant. Mr Fabio was quick to attend to me at the door and confirmed a 8pm seating. He was attentive and polite to me despite people waiting around the door trying to get the his attention. This dinner was to celebrate my partner's birthday. At about 8.10pm, i was approached by Ms Sheena with her beautiful smile and demeanour to confirm my table and was shown to where i was to be seated.Sat at the counter table with full view of the kitchen where all the magic happened. Fabio explained the menu of the day to me in the most respectful manner and orders were taken.Food was heavenly and served as soon as it was out from the oven and the bbq pan. These people know their meat inside out. Be it lamb, pork, seafood or beef. All dishes were cooked to perfection with beautiful plating even though it was a casual dining experience. The whole restaurant was super busy with staffs moving up and down the walkway attending to each and every guest. Chefs were cooking one dish after another with Chef Deborah helming the operations of the kitchen (We sat right infront of her) but will still patiently explain the dish when she presented it infront of us. Don't be deceived by chef Deborah's stern look. She actually has a very beautiful smile.The Onglet (beef steak), Marron (lobster) and their own Sanger (pulled pork burger) are to DIE for... Before the end of the evening, Fabio surprised my partner with a Buttercake for her birthday. I was surprised he remembered that when i briefly told him while making my reservation. Talk about guest centric. He nailed it on the head.Burnt Ends deserves to be in Asia's Top 50 restaurant for their food and services and i will like to thank Mr Fabio, Ms Sheena and Chef Deborah for making my 1st visit memorable

So this is a place where you go to be sufficiently engaged by the service staff (whose service is not charged for in your bill - so the menu reminds you at the start of your meal) not only during the sense making of the menu, but also the ordering process, meal handling and clearing of your plate. Your palate is guaranteed to be sufficiently engaged cos' there was nothing that came to your table that was not so naturally and beautifully curated, richly textured with spices, layered with ingredients that tend to reinforce each other and leave you wanting more until you hit that part where your sensory overload coincides with your sense of satiation that can come by so unexpectedly. So be careful cos' once you get to that poiint, diminishing returns is bound to set in. This sense of agency is a form or action that will also keep you sufficiently engaged - the other of course is how ridiculously attractive the majority of the crew are - from the hirsute head chef with his leather apron that takes you to another fantasy plane to the tattooed pretty boy chef that calls out the sequence of meals to the line cooks and then there was the mixologist who brews the most delicious of libation to the previously mentioned service staff that should set your ardor sufficiently engaged with their product knowledge, attentive courtesy and cheeky smiles. So when you leave paying the hefty bill - it all seems worth the 2 month wait to get a table
5
Been dining here for the past few years, food is excellent and consistent. Staff are friendly and professional - restaurant has a great atmosphere, and provides a rather epic dining experience.

good charring of meat. Pulled pork was flavorful. We ordered the onglet with bone marrow, and the mayura cube roll. turned out the cheaper steak got better flavor. and prices are reasonable for the main items, just don't go for the quail eggs or the beef marmalade. the vegetables are good too. the staff are attentive. too bad it is a pain to make a reservation, else I would want to eat here every month
4
The food here is very good - from the starters to the dessert ... we loved the Beef Marmalade and starters best so did not gofer a large piece of beef but they looked great. Service was excellent despite some of the reviews. I think the experience would be different depending where you sit - we sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and it was fascinating
5
I can only give 5 stars if i could it would be 10 start the service was the most professional i have seen in years .we were lucky to get the chefs table tonight and the food was the best i have eaten in 30 years and 20 country's this is a whole other level of cooking something i could only imagine to do myself i spent my entire time tranfixed at the kitchen and watching the love that was put into each plate my hat goes off to you guys i cant wait to get back to singapore to eat here again Thanks for the experience guys

We were fortunate to visit Burnt Ends restaurant yesterday for a memorable lunch. The service was exceptional, especially as service in Singapore can be quite poor at times. The food was varied and each dish was superb and beautifully presented. We all enjoyed something we would not normally eat. Being able to watch the chefs at work was also a bonus.Last year we were delighted to eat at Uma in Barcelona ( rated No.1 on TripAdvisor at the time) and I think Burnt Ends is equally as good as a dining experience.
5
Amazing food. The flavours of the meat in a tasting type menu best I have experienced in Singapore in 10 years living here - and the best in Asia. Dave and his team very hospitable providing wonderful service that enhanced the whole open kitchen / counter seat dining experience - I could have been easily dining in London or Tokyo. Great beer, wine and cocktail selection as well
5
We dined at burnt ends twice during our recent brief visit to Singapore .Dinner followed by lunch the next day.Having been recommended to go and researched its high global ranking we had high expectations which quite frankly were easily exceeded.It's food and drinks theatre complimented by outstanding aromas and delicious food and drinks especially the house cocktails .Dave, Jake, Andrew and Dillon are professional dispensers of friendly hospitality rarely seen even in friendly Singapore .Food highlights were the quail eggs, duck hearts, steak frites, eggplant and of course any choice cut of wagyu steak.I recommend leaving the food selection to Dave ...The space is very inviting and suggest you arrive early to get best seat in house in front of Dave and Jake The bill can certainly build with some meat cuts close to $400 a kg...But best to just have another home brew cocktail and forget about it.A true treat and a good reason to revisit Singapore sooner than later.We booked 2 months ahead which is advisable.Simply amazing!!!

Since it has been given a spot on the lists of Asia 50 best restaurants and world 100 best restaurants for 2 consecutive years, I had high expectations for it. Sadly it was pretty disappointing... nothing stood out for the dishes I ordered including the famous burger and caviar with quail eggs... BBQ beef meister burger from shake and shack is definitely better than burnt ends'... there is nothing special about the quail egg with the caviar and it was quite pricy... quite a no. of ppl loved it so much and sorry to say that I am definitely not one of them. The portion of the dishes were quite small and all of them with a very salty and smoky flavor... I am not a fan of it... overall it was pretty bad experience for the dishes they created... feel sorry for chef Andre Chang from restaurant Andre, the man behind of burnt ends... coz Andre is definitely worthy visiting... buy the way the desert had a smoky flavor too...it was like you are licking an iron bar... u can literally taste the iron... however, their sommelier was quite professional and informative ... :
5
Great place for any meal but lunch was fun and took the afternoon as we made our way through the menu of masterfully done meats, extras and drinks. Had tried for dinner on two other trips and it exceeded all expectations. Finest steak I have had in Asia and maybe the states
4
My husband and I went there for lunch 2 Saturdays ago for lunch and had a great time. Service was good. We didn't hold back on ordering beacuse we assumed the portion would not be huge. However, the waiter told us to cut back on certain dishes as he knew that it would be too much for 2. He was right - by the end of the meal we were so stuffed. The menu changes at every service. The quality of food is very good as expected. Hence, the price. You pay for what you get. Overall, highly recommended if you dig the open kitchen concept
5
Ok its hard to get into, you know its expensive but WOW. I have rarely had a dining experience where each and every course was excellent !
Top dollar but we walked away very, very happy and highly recommend Burnt Ends.
1
Didn't even get to try the food although the steak looked nice. Plain and simply, the attitude of the head chef/part owner was poor and the restaurant's lack of flexibility makes me wonder how much longer this restaurant can stay in the world's top hundred?

With so much chatter about this venue, we decided to do a dinner taste test while passing through Singapore. The result was a mixed experience. Service was impeccable. The staff were a finely tuned team of smiles and courtesy with attention to details and product. Plates and cutlery were replaced with each course and someone was ever ready to assist with seating. The menu was explained clearly and recommendations flowed easily.Food was technically well executed. There's nothing significant to fault. Our skewer of grilled duck heart had a lightly salted crisp exterior with tender meat. The Burnt End's Sanger was a thick patty of pulled pork shoulder topped with julienne radicchio tossed thick aioli and sandwiched by a brioche bun. The slices of grilled onglet was medium rare and accompanied by fragrant bits of bone marrow and sweet burnt onion puree. Dessert was a scoop of refreshing mint ice cream resting on rich medium-sweet chocolate ganache and topped with broken bits of dark chocolate sponge. We loved the service and food elements of the product but had little appreciation of the space planning and design effect on the dining experience. Originally seated in the dim narrow passageway on hard high stools facing the wall with a narrow grill for a table top due to the mistake of the receptionist, it conjured the mental image of a prison cell. Seating in front of the live kitchen wasn't significantly better with the marginally extra table space, downlights and burners. Unless we were obsessed with watching the kitchen work, the space did not encourage us to linger on a long dinner with drinks and conversations. In addition, the high prices in the wine list did not further encourage our patronage. We understand that alcohol is dearer in Singapore but $30 for a glass of Lucy Margaux Wildman Pinot Nior which can be purchased at an additional $10 for a whole bottle (and considered an average wine in Australia) was a price-value disconnect.A dinner affair with nibbles, main and dessert here would easily cross $150 nett per person. We felt that food and beverage at such price points, well executed and coupled with fantastic service were starkly juxtaposed with the cramped quarters. Socialising was constrained to the person on your left and right. Our clothes gradually absorbed the scent of grilled meat and there was the constant heat from the hot coals on our skin. We would return for the food and service if we were not dressed in finery; not on a romantic date; and just looking to chat up the chefs at the pass.

I'm never stepping foot in this place ever again! A server split hot oil on my friend's expensive clothes, luckily she didn't suffer any burns but very well could have! Everyone saw it but no one from the staff team apologized to her nor offered assistance of any type. Oh yes, a server came to ask my friend to "drop" her clothes off the next day if she'd like them dry cleaned. When my friend's husband asked for the owner Dave Pynt, his behavior was non apologetic, callous & downright rude. He simply stated, "yup, accidents happen!". When the argument persisted he nonchalantly said, "you wanna get a piece of me, let's go out"! For an upscale restaurant filled with well heeled, well travelled patrons, this behavior is appalling. I'm going to go a step further and say the man, Dave's demeanor was racist, it has to be, for there is no other explanation to his outright prejudice! Would he behaved the same had our party been a group of aussies? Most probably not! None of us are ever giving this place our business dollars ever again & will ensure no one else has to suffer this ordeal ever again

Interesting place. Most people sit at the bar. There is a big table but you need to be a group of people to book it. So you are having a dinner and a show watching people work (not ideal for romantic dates but doable). The people in the kitchen side are not super friendly, okay they are working but a bit too serious frankly.Cocktails: My Wife order one of the special cocktails and it was amazing, I took a simple G&T and could not taste the gin (disappointing for the price!)Food was very good (although too rich for my Wife, sauce with the meat etc...). For the high bill at the end and the average ambiance, the experience was not 'a must do again' for me but definitely worth a try for curious foodies who loves meat and willing to spend :-

Burnt Ends is a very small, trendy restaurant in Chinatown. It offers some of the best barbecue I have had (including a number of spots in SW USA, and Texas).The menu is minimalistic, but the staff is very knowlegeable. They were able to explain every dish incredibly well and we were happy with all of our choices. The cocktails were also very creative. The "kitchen" is essentially just across from the seating area (mostly bar style seating, think of a typical Sushi bar and you get the idea), and it was a lot of fun watching them prepare/cook the different meats.Overall the prices were on the slightly expensive side, but not outrageous for an established dining location. Obviously it doesn't compare to Hawker stalls in regards to value, but it was its own unique experience in Singapore that was well worth it
5
we are so luckly while our trip to singapore we had got a chance ,,its Really very difficult to get the table at the small and famous Restaurant ..but we are one of them lucky grilled beef and Red wine pair its Really amazing fair of food ,they had mostly all small Bites food ,,live kitchen is so interesting .we can see whats chef is preparing ..,,we will definitley back again soo

What a waste of time. Horrible experience in this ridiculously small restaurant. Allow me to share few points, my wife and me went there on April 13 2017. 1. In a fish (salmon trout) that was half raw and tasteless, my wife found a live worm!! The waiter didn't even bother to apologize, he just said that the live worm (or whatever this small animal was) was already in the fish when it reached the restaurant. They didn't charge us for this fish (S$75) though.2. Menu is without any description, just one or two words, no images, you can't figure out what is what. I guess they think it makes them more "fine dinining". There's nothing specially fine about super small bar table, people who walk over each other, expensive food and fish with a worm. For 30+ people that can fit into the restaurant, they have only 1 uni sex toilet. So you can imagine how long people wait.3. Restaurant is super small, there's often not enough space for plates, cutlery, glasses and food. It's hard for people to walk behind you, many times we hit the person next to us, due to everything being crammed. I liked the open kitchen though. 4. Way too expensive for the food quality, service, and ambient. Wines go up to S$900 for a bottle! Cheapest wine per glass is S$30. They charged us bottle of water S$11, without asking if we want still or sparkling one. So waiter assumed we want the sparkling one. 5. If you don't show up after you reserved the "seat" on the bar table, they will charge your credit card with a no-show fee

Burnt Ends is super trendy. But we found it expensive for what you get. We had two starters including jerk chicken, as well as pulled pork burger and beef for the mains. We also had red wine.The highlight turned out to be the pulled pork burger. Absolutely delish, and for us about the only sensibly priced item. I would come back for the pulled pork burger, and that's pretty much it. We were seated outside, and found the service friendly. Perhaps we'd been more impressed if we'd been part of the action inside. Is the food good? Yes. Is it really worth the prices? I am not sure, certainly not the starters. Cool is expensive
5
Excellent food and atmosphere. The food is cooked just in front of you with I think three diffrent ovens and a coal grill. All meat dishes in here are to die for and the entrees were extremely delicious as well. This place is a must while in Singapore
5
Great place, fantastic food. Creative and delicious.
Incredible how subtle the flavours are.
Loved the venison.

We had read about Burnt Ends and tried booking a month ahead. It was full on the day we were to be in Singapore, as we don't live in Singapore. They can book out up to 2 months in advance. However they mentioned that sometimes walk-ins around 6pm could be accommodated. Taking the chance we caught a taxi to China Town and got there around 5:45. Thomas was able to give us a table at 8:00. We were ecstatic. The meal and service was faultless. Many of the dishes are small plates so you can try many dishes. We had 5. 3 entrees and 2 mains. The quail, the striploin, the Jamaican chicken - unforgettable. The marrow bone Onglet and Mayura Cube (a wagyu steak) both perfectly done. Each dish had its own deliciousness. Dessert, could not get better. We were meant to eat here! Will do it again.

Did a walk in lunch on a Friday and waited for about 1.5 hours for a fantastic seat in-front of the preparation table. What i liked about the concept of this restaurant was that you get to watch the hustle and bustle of the kitchen while waiting for your food to be served. Had the Caviar Quail Egg, Pulled Pork Sanger, King Crab and Steak with Bone Marrow Sauce. The dish i enjoyed most would be the King Crab as the garlic and butter sauce is heavenly when eaten with the crab meat. They are known for their pulled pork sanger which was really awesome as well. All in all a good meal and definitely worth the price paid. While waiting for a seat you can head down to the heart of Chinatown for a walk as there are many things to see there
5
Had the pleasure of dining at this wonderful restaurant last week. It's not just a restaurant, it's a dining experience. The dishes that were served makes you want to keep going back.From the quail eggs to the roast lamb to the berry tart, just mouth watering.The service was excellent as well

We booked two months prior to our holiday in Singapore due to the waiting list to ensure that we would dine at Burnt Ends. Our reservation was on the Thursday, but while in China Town late on Saturday afternoon we thought we would have a look and call in for a drink. Dillion whipped up a smokey thyme infused bourbon concoction for us while we were seated up front as the lunch diners were drifting out. David Pynt introduced himself and before I knew it I was behind the pass talking ovens with him. Top Perth Chef, no BS here. We had a few laughs another drink and headed back into the rain.  Dave advised us to get in early as you only get pole position at his place by first come first served. On Thursday Dave had flown out on holiday and Jake was leading the team. He introduced himself and we picked up from where we left on Saturday. Dillion concocted another heady mixture and we let Jake chose a menu for us, smoked quails eggs with caviar, duck hearts and a number of other incredible dishes which Jake just kept flowing. The main course was Japanese salmon trout, which was outstanding. There was only one desert, when I tasted the pastry on this tart, there was no need for any other choice. Dillion kept Penny on the DP while I worked my way through a fantastic Shiraz, Riesling and sticky pudding wine with that fantastic tart. What a great place for a long lunch, Dave has cracked it, letting the food speak for itself while being guided and respected by gifted craftsmen. Can't wait for our next visit Cheers and thank you

I went there with friends on my birthday. You can only reserve a seat for an early sitting, so we took our chances and could only get a table on the pavement outside. However, people watching from there was fun, and the service and food were top notch.Starters are on a tapas basis. We had the famous Quail's Egg and Caviar, Eggplant Miso, and Beef Marmalade with Pickles, which were all delicious. For the main course, we all shared the Beef Onglet with Bone Marrow, which you can get in as big a piece as you want. It was slow cooked to medium rare and beautifully tender. The wine list is fairly extensive but definitely not cheap or even good value, but that's Singapore for you. However, the food was very good value
5
I first visited Burnt Ends for dinner a couple of years ago and was so impressed that on traveling to Singapore last week I booked again as wanted to see whether the standard of food was as good as I remembered. Could only get a booking for Saturday lunch - so still extremely popular! All I an say is - Brilliant!!! Great food, great service and well worth making the effort to get a reservation. I'll be back next time I'm in Singapore

We booked months in advance to sit overlooking the kitchen for my partner's birthday...when we arrived we learnt that the booking didn't guarantee you a seat overlooking the kitchen - it just meant you had a seat at the bar. Of which mine was an awkward one on the end :( We were disappointed at first but once the food came and the service kicked in it didn't matter. The experience was still fantastic. We had the Grisinni & Taramasalata and Jamaican Jerk Chicken with lime mayo to start with which were delicious. A perfect combination of smokey and smooth flavours demonstrating exceptional technique with the impressive smoker Aussie Chef Dave Pynt has got cracking in the kitchen. We then shared the Pulled Pork Shoulder & Coleslaw Sanga (brioche bun) and Smoked King Fish in a tomato and basil sauce which were both full of smoky, juicy goodness. The staff were extremely attentive and lovely. They surprised us with a piece of cake and candle and sang happy birthday to my partner at the end of the night which was a gorgeous touch. Great experience all in all. Quite expensive - especially drinks. But we didn't go there for the drinks...and it delivered on our food expectations and then some. Well worth a visit. 
5
I would rate this place with 9 stars if I could. I love the chill atmosphere, food and the service. I can see why this was ranked the #2 restaurant in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants. Everything is just awesome here!My favorite dishes were their Steak frites, wagyu onglet and alaskan king crab leg.

We made reservations at Burnt Ends over a month before arriving in Singapore because we heard that reservations could be difficult and this restaurant came highly recommended by a friend. We arrived about 20 minutes early and were immediately seated at the bar in front of where dishes are prepared ("table" 16 I believe). Upon being seated we were provided with the menus and offered drinks. It should be noted that there is only one traditional table, which requires a minimum purchase. The rest of the "tables" are actually a bar which gives you a great view of the kitchen. There is an additional bar along the wall and one outside. When we were first seated there was only one other couple at the restaurant and I noted the kitchen seemed rather calm as they began to work on orders. After about 20 minutes the restaurant began to fill up and the kitchen came to life. I noted the staff was diligently working, but remained pleasant. The wait staff was very attentive and provided excellent recommendations. Should we have the opportunity to return, we will opt for the chef's selection. Each item was amazing and this ranks as one of my top dinning experiences. The Chef was over the top amazing! Our interactions with him were beyond pleasant. We found him to be very attentive and he regularly checked in on us. I noticed he would regularly check in on other guests and engage in conversations, all while running the kitchen. Having been to other similar restaurants and reading a few reviews, we were not sure what to expect. The friendly nature of the chef and the entire staff, along with the quality and taste of the food, made our lunch an experience as opposed to just "lunch." Lunch felt like a private experience and we "forgot" that this was a packed restaurant.

I had heard good things about the food and decided to take a friend there for a farewell treat. We arrived shortly after 7pm and were advised that only outside seating was available and would have to wait till about 8.30pm. We were contacted shortly after 8.30 to advise that the table was ready. (so far so good) They show us over to a table the size of no more than half a metre wide by half a meter long; to be sitting next to a couple where a 5cm gap between us would have been generous!! When pointing this fact out to the manager the attitude was take it or leave it. I asked to speak to someone else - to which he handed us over the owner/chef, who was arrogant disdainful and seemed "put out" with our petty complaints and did nothing whatsoever to show any form of customer courtesy which actually would have gone a long way. Given that the lowest spend likely at this establishment will be $200 ++ per person I find this behaviour incredibly appalling. So moved was I by this horrendous treatment that this is my first review. I would actively encourage people to boycott this place until they can learn to appreciate their clientele and not treat the very people who make the place a success like some inconvenience

Upon my recent trip to Singapore I went to the recommended and acclaimed Burnt Ends. I booked exactly three months to the day and got the seats and time I wanted. I highly recommend you do the same as when we arrived, there was already a long list of people trying to get on their waitlist. And after dining, I understood why.We sat at the chefs counter which was an absolute delight. We were fascinated by the ballet performed by the executive chef firing off orders, and the chefs and sous chefs creating the masterpieces to deliver to the hungry customers greedily eyeing them all!And each dish was a surprising delight. From the grissini, to the chicken bacon, to the incredible not-to-be-missed beef marmalade! Our foodie palates were excited and often intrigued by what we thought were simple dishes but were impossible to reconstruct if we had to try.I highly recommend Burnt Ends!
3
We had 4 people, eating at the counter. We waited 6 weeks for our booking. I could only recommend this place for couples or 3's, since you'll be sitting at a straight bench and group discussions dont really work in this configuration.The food we did receive was very nice, fresh and tasted great. Atmosphere was good and the kitchen appeared to be running smoothly, was great to see the food being made in front of you.The service however was a mess. Ordering was confusing, some menu items unavailable, but clearly available on the menu (beef ribs). The portion sizes were unclear until the waitress explained each one individually, making ordering difficult. My main was not noted down by the waitress and missed completely and did not arrive, it was too late once it was realised they had forgotten it, luckily I was sharing another main with a friend. Mains took a while to arrive, so we were very hopeful. The fish and the pork sandwich were very good, but the missing ribs were a puzzle with a sad conclusion. It took around 20-25 mins for the mains to be served after entre. Alot of hassle to eat half a pulled pork sandwich!My friends empty wine glass was delivered, but no wine was poured for 10mins, until we asked what was going on to remind them. My two friends starter plates were cleared whilst mine and my partners dirty ones were left there during main service. Again we had to prompt the wait staff to do their job. Meanwhile the boss stood by texting whilst there was clearly major issues with front of house's coordination.I'm not sure why fine dining restaurants hire high school kids/amateurs to serve customers. Service is just as important in these situations, and im not even all that picky normally. I had high hopes for this place because it gets rave reviews, but all the mistakes added up just made it an overall disappointing experience

Book this restaurant several months in advance as it is extremely popular! Visited the restaurant on an early weekday evening, and was greeted warmly by the servers and guided to our counter seats. Definitely the optimum choice of seats to see the chefs in action. Unfortunately, the star head chef David Pynt was busy with family matters, but we were served graciously by Chef Kun and crew. The food was remarkable, and service was appropriately personal, though when it got busier the personal touch became diluted. The appetisers were amuse buche, bite-sized snacks, such as steak frites and beef marmalade with pickles. They were really scrumptious and generous portion, though the price was not forgiving either. We ordered the signature Burnt Ends sanger and Beef flank steak with bone marrow for entree, and both were excellent, with smoky flavour and sufficient seasoning. Perhaps the achilles heel of the meal was in the desserts, as the blueberry tart and mint ice cream with chocolate crumble were tasty but plain. Overall, an enjoyable experience, with friendly service and delectable food. Will come visit again as it was pretty worth the price tag

This was our usual birthday celebration with old friends and we have tried all sorts of fine dinning places in Singapore. This must rank as one of the best we have had. We had a 3 month reservation at the Chef's table and were treated to a wonderful mult-course meal. Steaks were excellent as we would expect but so were the crab legs and the appetizers. Waiters were friendly, cheerful and made the whole evening fun and relaxing
5
Our amazing experience started with awesome drinks (the best we had in Singapure).The guy who makes the drinks is super nice and he also helped us chose a fantastic wine from the list, which is very broad, with wines from all over the world. He really knows what he´s doing there.The menu is very interesting, changes every day, and has many options of vegetables, meat, fish etc.All the combinations of flavours and textures are just amazing.We regreted not ordering the tasting menu after we started to eat.We had 5 dishes for 2 people and it was enough, but we wished we had eaten more because it was just too good!We regreted leaving it for our last day in Singapure, because if we had gone before, we would have come back every day of the trip!You should make a reservations, because the restaurant is small and it was packed
5
It was a very busy restaurant, so getting seats was challenging! The open kitchen helped too in giving out the busy vibe of the place. It was interesting to see how food was prepared by the chefs too! We tried out some dishes and came out very well! Very light dishes, you go there for the taste, not to get stuffed!
5
We were initially a bit overwhelmed by the amount of choice on the menu; a cornucopia of tasty dishes (I understand that it is constantly evolving and changes daily). In the end we opted for the Chef's Select - a bespoke menu created then and there by the head chef. I would thoroughly recommend this option to anybody eating at the restaurant. It was a nice surprise never knowing what dish was going to be next. It’s also a great way to sample the menu.We were greeted by head chef, the charismatic Dave Pynt, who asked how hungry our group was and whether we wanted to walk or roll out of the establishment once we had finished the meal. He asked a few further questions about foods that we liked/didn't like, any particular dishes that we wanted to sample and how much we wanted to spend.We ended up sampling 17 dishes and numerous delicious bottles of red (I'm not a big wine fan, but the 2014 Miamup Cabernet Sauvignon really hit the spot. Yes, you will pay Singapore prices for the alcohol). The service staff were really friendly, attentive and looked after us throughout. I like the open kitchen format: it was enjoyable to see Dave and his talented team working their magic and cooking up the dishes.Now for the important part... the food was sumptuous. Each dish a small perfectly prepared parcel of joy bursting with flavour. The steak tartare, beef marmalade, leg of lamb and pickleback (a shot of pickle juice, followed by a shot of whiskey followed by a sanger burger) were particular highlights. Also, the marshmallows. Do not leave without having one: a moment of gloriously gooey goodness
5
Dave Pynt's burnt ends is an absolute home run. The concept is brilliant and the cooking seriously couldn't be better. It is clearly one of the best restaurants in the city. Have the beef marmalade, the squab, the leeks, the king crab, the scallops or whatever the chef recommends. The guy is a seriously talented and inspired cook
4
We ate at the table outside since those were the only ones open to walk in customers. We were greeted by a wait staff who gave us a one sheet menu with the date of the day of our visit ... so perhaps the menu is changed daily. At first glance, the menu appeared to be ordinary since none of the ingredients used stand out, but upon tasting everything that we ordered from appetiser to main course, I was amazed at how even things like chicken wing and asparagus can be prepared differently to give it a fresh, new flavour. The fennel salad with seaweed that accompanied the grilled Japanese sea bream was excellent as well.The high chair with a bar table facing the road was not my idea of a good place for dinner, but the good food helped me forget about it. Prices of menu items aren't low, but within the typical range for the same type of restaurant. Expect to spend about $75 per person without alcohol
5
I love coming to Burnt Ends! Never been a disappointment. You can sit right at the kitchen and see your meal prepared. They have great home made cocktails, all aged and poured from a wooden barrel.
You must make reservations.
5
My first time visiting Burnt Ends and it was simply amazing. Classy and yet casual is how i would describe my experience. We chose the Chef's Select under the lunch menu and was served with a course of delectable crusines after the chef came over to find out about our preference. Staff service was good, they were very friendly, polite and pretty attentive. Must try
5
There is an order of priority to booking here: the top chef's table goes first, then counter overlooking the grille, and then the bar seat facing a wall. Otherwise you will be disappointed. The food is excellent. Had the quail's egg with caviar that was excellent, the grilled sea bream (good for two but sold singly) and definitely try their aubergine and the garlic shoots. The food is sensitively cooked, with the right level of spices and nothing is overbearing or overpowering. They even gave us sea salt with the sea bream - they had not salted the fish; it didn't need it. Truly delectable and fab dining. Yeah it's not cheap but you will get your money's worth for sure. I am booking for the next time - 4 months out
4
I enjoyed my experience over all - the food was interesting and very tasty - however do not pick the "wall" tables as they are cramped and the best position is the kitchen tables The portions are small but good quality from the Oz chef who knows his stuff It's expensive but it doesn't seem to put anyone off 
3
Just not sure how to deal with this place. We walked in around 830, no tables available which is cool, it's popular and busy, but they did at least sit us in a bench in front of the wall. Here's where it gets interesting...We mentioned that we would be done within an hour. In that time frame, there were ten places available, and by the time we had finished there were 5. Now, you can't book unless it's for a 6 or 630pm sitting. So why were the seats open and we weren't able to take them?Something's up here, either they re taking extra cash for bookings or other. Either way, they're really not interested whether you're unhappy with this or not.Food is great, but people after a while just won't come back if this sort of behaviour continues. There are plenty of other options, won't be back. Shame because we love the dishes.Success will be short lived. It's a damn shame.
5
Don't mistake this place for your usual meat lovers steak house, where the more grams of beef the better. This is fine dining with a focus on meat protein, but with a casual modern twist. You sit up at a long low bar which might not be for everyone but you get engaged with what's going on. A mix of local and ex-pat Australian wait staff who know their stuff. Excellent range of Australian wines although they come with the premium Singapore price. Don't be fooled by the seemingly small menu, every dish works together, we had three starters between two and then shared 100gms of high grade beef which was ideal for lunch, but don't forget to finish off with the tart, oh and a nice whisky.Great dining experience, we'll be back

Perth man Dave opened this restaurant in Singapore nearly 4 years ago. He learnt this charcoal/ wood fired oven technique in Spain before opening and it is to die for. We were recommended to go with the chef's selection and Dave came to talk to us to find out if we wanted to walk out or roll out, and any allergies. He then selected a number of dishes to serve us...smoked quail egg with caviar, beef tartare on a fried potato stack, duck heart,Japanese sea bream, melt in your mouth superb fillet steak........ berry tart. All fantastic flavours and textures. The wine can be bought by the glass and the wine boys then seal the bottle with an argon gas sealer to keep it fresh. Any of the superb wines can be bought by the glass because of this. The team in the open kitchen worked well together under the watchful and professional eye of Dave. And they seemed to be relishing in the joy they presented on the plate. It is not a cheap lunch, but one that we will savour for a very long time. I wish that we had found him in Perth

The food was excellent, had the best lamb ribs I could imagine. Had to wait for around 25 minutes for a spot to open up - as they don't take reservations. Make sure you're given a spot at the counter, because the places at the tall side table are really, really bad. I as a solo diner was given one of those, even though there were empty spots (waiting for someone to show up probably).Prices were okay for the quality of food. At the side table the service also wasn't as good as it looked to be at the counter

I realise I am probably the minority here but the experience was so unpleasant it left a very bitter aftertaste. We had made a dinner booking weeks in advance for a Friday night 8pm for a party of 5 adults. We turned up on time and approached the front counter and they confirmed our booking HOWEVER, this is where things went awry. To clarify they had placed us around the bar corner next to the window in seats of 2s and 3s. The gentleman showing us the seats proceeded to tell us that since the previous party of two still had not left we would either:1. Have to ask the previous party to politely move to another area at the back which had seats for 2 OR2. Split ourselves up for dinner OR3. Give up the reservationFirstly, I do believe if you release a reservation for 8pm it is the restaurant's responsibility to get the seating available and not ours. Secondly, option 2 was just ridiculous. Option 3 please refer to opening statement of this paragraph. What rubbed it in further was he did not seem very apologetic and just shrugged. Appalling.In the end we had to wait nearly an hour for the booked table to leave, honestly we would have left if not for the friend who really was dying to try the place. Never going back

Had dinner her with my sister and even before we stepped into the restaurant, the service staff were already quick to notice you, and the service just never falters from there. The service staff were friendly, always there when you needed their attention, and communication with the kitchen was obviously good. We were seated right where the head chef works and it was a really great spot as most items had their finishing touches put on right before you. Also you get to see all the food coming out of the kitchen, and it seems that the Sanger might be one of the most popular items. No need to worry about the heat in the place as the air-conditioning somehow manages to cool the restaurant sufficiently. While the exhaust makes sure you do not smell like you came from a barbecue party. And if your dinner companion heads to the toilet or is boring, just watch all the action in the kitchen or ask the friendly staff about the HUGE oven in the restaurant. For the menu, we decided to let the chef decide for us, but insisted on the smoked quails egg & caviar (really lovely light starter), and the bone marrow bun (Loved the crisp burnt parts of the bread!). No regrets on the decision at all! Everything was delicious, an explosion of flavours! Some with a contrast of textures. Some with contrast of temperatures. ALWAYS full of flavour. And honestly, get into it with your hands, because you'll end up licking your fingers clean anyway. We thought we were about done when we were given our first (of 5 desserts). Desserts here are sweet, as most desserts will be. If you're not a big sweet tooth and just want a little finisher to your meal, I'd say go for the Marshmallow. It's just a perfect mouthful, melts away with the mouth after you crack though the burnt crust and leaves you satisfied and ready to go to bed. Another thing I noticed while having desserts is when there is smoked ice cream or smoked butter, it's definitely easier to spot when compared to the savoury items. Took dessert to a different level for me. Absolutely loved the whole experience

Booked two months' back for the only table to celebrate friend's birthday. Service was great and there was good bantering with the service staff. Food selection had good appetizers, and we had the lobster crabs, suckling pig and desserts. Wine selection is as also good.
5
The fantastic service topped off the best food we've had in Singapore in ages. High end and they deliver in spades. Chef Davis spoiled us with the Chef's Menu and Leon's service was impeccable. A wonderful date night with my wife.
5
Chef Dave Pint built for his restaurant, his four special oven for baking large quantities of meat. The grill menu, which changes every day, deserve attention lamb, chicken, king crab, fish, snapper, and fennel and leek: they, too, are prepared on the grill.
5
Busy restaurant, so you must book way in advance. Worth the effort if you like wholesome BBQ style food. Highly recommend any of the meat dishes, you should also try the crab legs which are brilliant. The menu changes often, so expect some challenges and surprises. Prices are reasonable for the quality, and you will end up around $100-150 per head. Enjoy
5
As there were 7 of us, we managed to get the chef's table for dinner. It proved to be an exciting can chose your price range starting from $150 per pax. You won't know what exactly you will be but you will have some idea of whether the menu will include fish, beef, seafood etc..Our Grissimi Taramasalata was fresh and tangy . The steak frites were surprisingly succulent with a nice crisp finish. Bef marmalade and house pickles followed by garlic shoots and Gremllata refreshed our palates. The king crab with garlic brown butter was a superb dish... ask for some bread to wipe off the butter ! I felt the 45-day dry aged rib- was very good, not so chewy and full of flavour. Desserts were pineapple and rum sabayon and sweet cake and smoked ice cream. The were finished almost immediately. All in all a superb meal and very filling. The wines are quite expensive and not a very good selection for that price. Service is very good and our waiter kept us updated on each dish. Definitely a place to re-visit but you need to book early if you want the only table in the house, otherwise you can sit at the counter
5
Friends invited us to this unique place where you more or less sit in the kitchen and can watch the kitchen staff prepare the dishes.Most impressing were:- the food. Outstanding delicious small dishes so you can enjoy plenty of different tastes- the way the kitchen staff prepared the dishes with so much respect and love for the ingredients. We can learn a lot from this.- the kitchen crew operated almost silently, no attitudes at all like some TV-chefs have. A lesson how to lead a team. Respect.There is a catch or two:- the place is very popular, so you may want to book well in advance- the seats at the bar facing the kitchen are very cool. The seats facing the wall are only half the fun, because you won't see the staff working. You will enjoy your food nevertheless.Great place to visit
4
First visit and dun know what to expect. A one page menu. Love all the appetizers. Delicious! All my friends also said the same. As for main course, the beef was good but not out of this world. The fish I personally feel can be improved. I think I will revisit (when I am not very hungry) and order all the appetizers and a drink
5
Went to Burnt Ends on Saturday night in Singapore and it felt like walking into a friends kitchen only difference is the massive wood oven and wood grill…. The staff were amazing and the Chef kept the crowd entertained and seemed to know everyone! After spending a couple of hours there and I got talking to the people on both sides of me (communal seating) it appears this place has become locals “food haven” who dine frequently. The food was awesome! I dined on my own and when I looked at all the food being served over the pass (Which is directly onto your place) I asked the Chef/Owner to take me on a culinary journey, and well he did just that! Every mouthful was an explosion of flavour with great technique and presentation. All I can say is next time I’m in Singapore I will be making a booking to get back in!!!! Enjoy Cheers Stev

Visited burnt ends and we booked a side table. The first thing that shouted out to me was the slim, uncomfortable table attached to the wall on the side. The chairs were bar stools and we had to perch ourselves on the chairs to have our dinner. The owners were trying to squeeze as much sitting space out of their unit and this obviously looked like an afterthought. Spending $300 on a meal and sitting like this was a first for me. Yes, I made the booking and chose that sit, but I had no idea it was going to be like that. And judging from the looks and complaints of other customers on the same table, I would imagine they were surprised too.On to the food!We had the followinggrissini and taramasalatabeef marmaladeleek with trufflesburnt ends burgercube roll 250gtrump caps 150gThe grissini starter tasted fresh from the herbs and tasty from the cured roe, so thats a good start. The beef marmalade was good, but it lacked imagination. It felt like combining a sure-win flavourful brisket and adding pickles on to a crunchy toast. Wouldn't go wrong. The leek with truffles were $42 and didn't taste like an appetizer worth that much. The pulled pork burger was rather different compared to the rest of the dishes in terms of size and presentation, but at $20, was really value for money.The wagyu like cube rolls were $50 per 100 grams, and it was really disappointing. There were more end fat to chew through and it wasn't as tender as other wagyus we have eaten before. However, the trump caps at ~$25 per 100g were surprisingly good, topped with onion gravy. Our total bill was about $280.Conclusion ? It's not worth the 1 month wait, the table sitting stinks and at the price, there's much better choices out there. If i had to redo it, i'll have done the following to bring the overall price down and of course get a better table by the chefs preparation area. 1. Grissini2. Beef Marmalade3. Burger4. Rump caps x 300gWhy is it popular ? Perhaps its a trending phase and because of the queues, some people could have forced themselves to imagine their meals were that good. A blind taste test between this restaurant and others may prove this true.A side note : The service was excellent though, they had an almost 1 to 1 staff to customer ratio, that's amazing. The staff was well informed and pleasant to interact with
5
Exciting to sit at counter and watch the tremendous dedication of the remarkable kitchen staff preparing creative dishes that taste amazing. Don't miss the sanger or the beef marmalade and try whatever cuts of steak are offered that night. One of the best meals I've ever had
5
Loved our meal here at this modern Australian barbecue restaurant. The chef had trained at the legendary Asador Etxebarri in Spain, which is like the Mecca for barbeque. Enjoyed the beef marmalade with pickles, as well as the Japanese sea bream.

My friends and I dined at Burnt Ends on the 12th of January. I was very unimpressed with the door "hostess", Sheena. I arrived around 6:35pm for my 6:30pm reservation, and informed her in a very apologetic manner that my other two friends were nearby (in the CBD) and would be reaching soon. She promptly told me with a disgruntled look, "They have to be within the 15 minute waiting period." and then walked off. So what would you have us do? Tell traffic to hurry up? Ask the Uber to crash his way through the cars? What else can I do if I tell you that people are already ON THE WAY, and REACHING SOON? I would appreciate it if you could shed on light on this matter. Clearly I am missing out on some new form of transportation where I can teleport from one place to another instantly?I then asked another waitress if it would be alright to go ahead and order first since my friends were a bit behind schedule, and she told me no problem, that would be fine. This lady, another Philippino, was very nice and behaved how any other normal serving staff should. I unfortunately did not manage to catch her name, but perhaps you could advise Sheena to learn from her. I understand you have a very strict reservation policy, and I completely understand this need, seeing as how Burnt Ends is a rather popular restaurant with limited seating capacity. However I felt that Sheena could have been more tactful, and not given me such a scathing look and answer when I told her that the other guests were running a little behind schedule. When my friends arrived shortly after and we were looking at the menu deciding what to order, I must note that no staff came forward to assist us. We were seated at the front of the restaurant, next to the door. I'm not sure if we were harder to see, but the rest of the staff were just scuttling back and forth, mostly looking at the seats towards the middle of the restaurant. We managed to get one guy's attention and asked for some help with the menu, but he just stood above us with a surly expression and did not seem very keen to offer any insight. We had to keep probing him, "...so... what do you recommend?" Seeing how my meal started off on such a bitter note, I had high expectations for the food. My friends and I have previously dined here on separate occasions, and always thoroughly enjoyed our meals. However, I am very sad to report that the standard of your food has dropped tremendously. The duck hearts were too salty, the sobrasada was mediocre at best, the leeks were outrageously overpriced, and the burrata was the worst I have ever eaten in my life. Burrata usually has a creamy, silky and slightly bouncy texture, but that day's burrata was hard and lumpy. The orange oil/emulsion just ruined the taste of the burrata, and I barely picked at it for fear of gagging. We had the leeks on previous occasions, and they were always a highlight of a meal. However, the quality of the leeks that were served to us that night did not justify the steep price. Burnt Ends needs to ensure that their customers entire experience is enjoyable. It seems like the restaurant has lost sight of the importance of the customer's experience. Maybe they're focusing on food, but as I have mentioned above, the food standard has really dropped. I was really looking forward to dining here again, but sadly, Burnt Ends really fell short of my expectations. I believe Burnt Ends has just become yet another overhyped dining establishment with mostly average dishes and the occasional good dish (the beef marmalade was still delicious), that is completely let down by its service
5
As expected a very long line but the friendly and genuinely courteous waitress gave us the first available table within 20 min.The Tar Tar brioche covered with caviar was melting in our mouths!The Sangan Burger was orgasmic and lobster was absolutely amazing. Coupled with a Howard Park Cabernet it was the most satisfying meal i ever had in Singapore
5
Everything was outstanding from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we we left. Observing the chef and his team at work was incredible - he was so calm and very in control. The food was perfect - incredibly flavour and not over the top. The service was super attentive but not in your face over the top. For a restaurant of this calibre the price was very reasonable - surprisingly actually! If this is the 70th best restaurant in the world then there are 69 other amazing dining experiences to be had...yum
5
I really recommend to try this place. Don't forget to book a sit 2 weeks before coming.It worth even sitting on hot street over metal table.Visiting 1-2 restaurants a day, this one gave me a brilliant dinner and unforgettable taste of meat, burger (I never thought, that meat for it can be cooked like a delicious ragout)! Menu is small, but totally enough to point this place as a gastronomic pearl of city.Thanks a lot, guys

The restaurant was tiny in size with about 19 counter seat, 6 bar seats, and chef table which could seat 8. The day before I checked its website, and was able to make a reservation for its counter seat. As I was one of its first customers of the day, I was able to get the first seat next to the cashier, with a great view of the open kitchen. Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar ($12+)Gone in a mouthful, it was an exciting moment in the mouth, although one could not help feeling that it was quite expensive for an egg.Duck Hearts and Peri Peri ($8+)I was not quite a fan of duck hearts and expecting it to be quite spicy, but it tasted chewy with a hint of spices.Beef Marmalade and Pickles ($14+)Very nice with the freshly cooked marmalade on the toast, but a tab messy to eat.Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20+)Pulled Pork Shoulder, Cole Slaw, Chipotle Aioli, Brioche BunI had this takeaway after looking at most other customers having it. It was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it. Almost could not finished it.Onglet, Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow ($32.10+)I like that the steak was served sliced which made it easy to eat with a fork. I was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted not great with the meat.Berry Tart ($12+)It was the dessert item of the day. Served with chantilly cream, although I wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it. Looked simple, it tasted quite good without too tart. I like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite.Overall food was great. Although the counter seats were full, the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal
5
The night started well and got better from there. We scored a bench seat right in front of the chef so could see first hand all the amazing dishes being prepared, which helped us choose from the very interesting menu- who ever thought you could turn the outside of a whole leek to charcoal and then serve the insides with truffle oil and nuts? The food was fantastic, chock full of intense flavours. The olive green gin based cocktail with burnt thyme on it was delicious beyond my expectation. Interesting wines and attentive service added to the experience. The smoked ice cream with sugar cake was the pinnacle of a truly exceptional dining experience
5
The place is small and cozy. Everything is about the food and cooking. Make reservations because it is always full. Every day the menu changes. Lots of tapas to order and 3/4 big dishes to choose and share. I would rather choose many tapas so that you can try a bit of everything. It's not cheap but worth every dollar.

The food was innovative and unusually prepared and presented, but apparently of high quality ingredients cooked with loving care. We failed to know, and the restaurant failed to advise, that the "bar counter" seat reservation was for two of eight hard, small metal stools against a thirteen inch metal shelf facing a blank wall. Clearly business is good as they were sold. The seating was essentially in a passage way and was so tight that my wife ended up by having to stand, because wait staff and customers kept bumping into her as they tried to squeeze past between her and the seats at the kitchen counter across the walkway. The beef marmalade was unusual and delectable, the Onglet (hanger steak) was some of the best, so perfectly cooked at rare, meat I have ever eaten. But the Jamaican Chicken and Crema would have shocked Marley - come on guys, S$10 for two chicken wings! Given seating against the counter facing the open kitchen the experience would be a fun, but an expensive, small plate experience. Take care where your reservation is made! Business deserves to be good, because the food is outstanding, but greed and packing in as many people as possible, without care for egress in the event of a fire, maximizes short term profit, not long term perceptions. Business must be good
5
Myself and my girlfriend had dinner here and it was really awesome. Beef marmalade melted in our mouths and the pork sanger left us full but wanting more.Then came the steak!!! So good! Sided with a marrow bone bun filled with flavour, it was epic! Service was great too, with staff being attentive and interested without being too invasive. Great experience!Will go again
4
I had a charcoal marshmallow here on my birthday night, and the $2 was so worth it. It is absolutely delicious, tastes like melted heaven in your mouth. I would definitely come back to try other stuff!

Partner's been raving about this place for years and finally had a chance to try it. Went for the Chef's Select, which was a great way to try many of the menu highlights. Opened with some sort of steak tartare, followed by venison tartare, scallop in XO sauce, beef marmalade and others. All pretty brilliant. But the mains were even better. Grilled crab legs smothered in butter sauce. And finally the piece de resistance - Australian wagyu served with a side of marrow bread. Dessert was a piece of melty toasty raclette cheese - pretty good but it was a little too much by then

If you are a foodie and looking to test your taste senses , then this is a must visit. Check the website for the current menu and choose as you wish or ask the staff for a recommendation. Be seated on a long counter over looking the wood fired oven. All is pr pared in front of you and interaction with head chef is a must. Beautiful selection of wines. Advance bookings is recommended.

This is not a cozy restaurant; do not expect a quiet table in a corner. Instead, however, you get a long counter with a fantastic array of courses prepared by some of the most charming cooks in Singapore. We started by ordering four dishes to share and ended up with six; stuffed as we were we kept ordering dishes because they looked so fabulous as they were prepared in front of us and whisked off to other diners. How could we not join in!? I was a bit put off by the restaurant's name as I'm not a big meat eater, but there are enough vegetarian and non-meat items to make a feast. On the day we were there we started with leek garnished with hazelnut and brown butter (fabulous); a fennel, orange and burrata starter that was divine, garlic shoots and gremoata (yum), and of course the famous 'Sanger' to start. We added beef marmalade and pickles and a dessert. And if you do want meat from the grill, you need to remember to order it first as it takes 20-30 minutes or so...but not to worry, lots of starters to share while you're waiting

I've been wanting to dine at Burnt Ends for a while now. Well, I finally went, and I was not disappointed. Superb food. Every dish we tried was cooked to perfection -- from the scallops to the pulled pork sanger, we were literally savoring every bite. I'd also recommend sitting at the countertop that looks directly into the kitchen; we found it fascinating to watch the chefs at work. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a meal so much. Definitely top of my list of restaurants to go to when next I'm in Singapore

Incredible stuff done with the grilled items. Started with the quail eggs and caviar. The bone marrow bun was insane..we had a range of other dishes as well. The standout was the amazing beef grilled to perfection with a burnt onion purÃ©e. I can have this everyday. Only thing is have to try to walk in as early as possible when they open since no reservations.
5
This place is the real deal. Brilliant produce, cooked to perfection, and confidence in the kitchen not to mess with any of the dishes. Some of the best dishes sneak up on with their simplicity - charred leeks straight out of the oven with brown butter and nuts was a stunner.If you want to see fantastic ingredients given space to really shine, try Burnt Ends. Get a seat at the counter, watch the chefs work, and enjoy what comes out. I did, and would go back in a second
5
We went in a group of eight this time and enjoyed it even more. Food was basically the same. High quality and Super rich in flavour. Dude food on steroids. The wine list has expanded substantially from our last visit which is also welcome. A friendly high quality but suitably relaxed night (and sore head the next day). Very much recommended

Had a great lunch at Burnt Ends this week. The place is small (only 19 seats along the counter) and difficult to get into, so either go early, or go online and make a reservation. There is no point to call- because they never pick up the phone. There is a minimal selection of choices but if you are going for grilled meat- you will find something delicious. If you don't eat meat and want seafood or something else then don't come here. If you are looking for perfectly grilled beef and some specialty items like bone marrow buns, you will love this place. Like most places in Singapore the service is horrible- so even though you will pay a lot of money for your meal- don't expect to be treated well. I got the pulled pork samdwich for lunch and I have to say it was the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. My Friend ordered a steak and was told it would take 45 minutes (strange since they serve everything rare and don't cook it for more than 8-10 minutes...) Anyway, I would say if you go with expectations of prompt, competent service, and flexibility on the menu and you will be disappointed But be patient and and don't expect too much - you will love this place!

A taste of Melbourne - like something you'd find tugged away in the corner of flinders lane. All dishes clicked well with the restaurant's name, you see the food from table to stove to plate being cooked right in front of your eyes. We started with quail egg and caviar, which was underwhelming. Zero explosion of flavour. The night got progressively better as we dug into the leek - brown butter sauce was to die for and nice texture with the hazelnuts. The burger was good, you can't really go wrong when soft strands of pork are sandwiched in between a brioche bun. There was a sort of spicy aioli which tied everything together wonderfully.The star of the nice was the onglet, where we learnt there and then - was flank steak. I thought flank steak had no marbling. Boy, was i wrong. The meat was marbled and juicy, charred in the right places and accompanied by bone marrow and burnt onion sauce. Delicious
5
Great food and atmosphere. The food is top quality and the portions are a good size. It's nice to share the dishes rather than order something each
5
Our experience at Burnt Ends was fantastic. You abstemiously must sit at the chef's counter, it's pretty much a dinner and a show. We had excellent seats and our meal was really really great. We started with cocktails and enjoyed the chicken, the beef marmalade, the sandwich, the leeks and of course perfectly cook steak before fishing with the sugar cake and marshmallows. Yes, it' exxy but it was a such a great night out and a perfect treat
5
Had an fantastic dinner here in march, We had seats at the bar with good view to the kitchen. Many good dishes, but the one I remember the most is the pulled pork burger. And with shots of whiskey and fermented cactus juice it was an awesome dish

Firstly, in my opinion, as an international traveller, burnt ends is a victim of its own success. The expectations were high before entering due to all the exceptional reviews so this place had to deliver and sadly for me it didn't on a few fronts. The concept was positively refreshing and a joy to experience. It's a shame it wasn't as well executed when it came to flavours. Firstly, some of the items such as the lamb were not available and no explanation was offered as to why not, especially given we were on the opening seating. The menu was limiting for non beef eaters (granted it's all about the beef!) , particularly when it came to main course. The food itself was good but I didn't experience the intense flavours which I was expecting. The food concept was simple which meant the flavours had to be on point but I felt they failed to delivered. As expected, the meat itself was cooked to perfection. Great concept but maybe the flavours need refinement. P.s. I loved the fact that an effort was made to incorporate some type of burnt element in to all dishes and drinks - class act! Would I go there once: yes, because of the concept and experience. Would I go again: no. Would I recommend it: if you love well cooked beef then yes. Note: due to seating arrangements, it's more positioned for couples rather than groups. Note: located in China town, very easy to find.

Well, well, well. We waited 30 minutes for a table which was fine because the restaurant has a great ambience and is an exciting environment. Starters were nothing short of awesome. Beef marmalade a standout, we had a smoked/raw beef (apologies for not remembering the name of the dish) truly excellent. From there we had issues. We ordered buffalo mozzarella which was served with chunks of fennel and complimented with an orange dressing. The dish should have been served with bread or toast and the dressing unfortunately overpowered the beauty of buratta. Next up was flank steak slow cooked with marrow. The meat was divine yet served with a stock reduction which wasn't needed and took away the benefits of cooking a product for 45 minutes, which on it own was perfect. We are talking delicate flavours here that should stand alone, not camouflaged with gravies.Salads are over dressed and this needs to be curtailed as well. Disappointingly, the head chef, while quite personable early, didn't seem to appreciate feedback and unfortunately this is typical of travelled Australian chefs that absorb high ego levels as demand for their services rises. This was evident when we observed his service to complimentary customers, yet almost dismisses you on leaving. I might add, the meal was 200 dollars excluding wine (80 dollars and fair value) which means that if I'm going to pay real money for a meal, I expect attention if the outcome doesn't meet expectations. Get the ego in check, listen to feedback and you have a great product. I'll be back one more time to see if I've been heard.70%... Almost worth it

This restaurant lives up to its reputation. The food quality is very good and the dishes are quite unique. Trendy vibe with community style seating and attentive , well trained staff. The drinks were good but founds the wines at a minimum of SGD 20 bucks ++ per glass expensive and something the management should look into
5
We dined there with my friends and was truly thankful for they sat us in the best seat where we could witness how our foods are prepared. We've tried most of their dishes and all of it is amazing! Perfectly done and everything tastes divine. All the staffs are very passionate in what they do. Truly a great gem hidden near Chinatown. All we could say we really left the restaurant we are extremely full, contented, one of a kind experience and worth every penny spent. Will definitely be back for more.

I went by myself today just to try out this place. The good side: meet items are very nice, today I tried beef marmalade with pickled cucumbers and grilled flank with salad. Both taste great! The beef marmalade is very juicy and flavourful. The flank is very fresh and grilled in a perfect way. As a meet lover, I really enjoyed the rich taste of these two dishes. As for the size of the dishes, the beef marmalade comes in two servings and the flank is sold by weight. The beef marmalade is good for both two people to share and solo meet lovers like me. Also, the ambience is quite nice, customers can see how the food is prepared at the counter seats. However, the view is not as nice for those counter seats close to the entrance. So if you really want to have a good view on how the food is prepared, you need to contact the restaurant after the reservation is confirmed.The down side: the reservation problem is still there. I made reservation online but they cannot find my name. The servant didn't mention that the still water is not for free when suggesting that option, but was happy to take it off bill when I pointed out. The vegetable dish I ordered was garlic sprouts. The serving size was way too small (around four sprouts) and too greasy
5
What a fun but expensive place to eat. Ask for a seat where the bartender makes the drinks. It is a real show and you might even get a few samples if you are nice..... Every cocktail as a burnt herb of some sort in it.The food was divine. The small plates are a great way to share and taste many things on the menu less expensively than the 45 day dry aged beef. However, the beef was slow roasted on the rib and it melted in our mouth. The grissini and taramasalta was outstanding as was the leek, hazelnut do brown butter. Our least favorite thing on the menu was the Jamaican chicken but it was still very good.The seats facing the away from the action, facing the wall were uncomfortable. We recommend if you cannot get a seat watching the action of the chef and bartender do not go. So plan in advance and make reservations far in advance.If you want a unique (definitely not your typical) Australian BBQ restaurant, then you do not want to miss Burnt Ends

This is an extremely small place fully packed up. There is chefs table which is a long bar type seating with high table and high bar stools at the back of it. Same high chairs and is outside. My wife wanted to experience this place and I obliged. I tried to book but they are full for a month or so we decided to walk in. We were able to sit outside so We get to try the food. Total bill for two of us was 350$. We have tried a few appetizers, salads and shared a 300gr wagyu beef. The good:Service. Except wagyu food was ok, given its price it was not exceptional. The bad:Wagyu. I expected a Uniform marble meat for 50$/100gr. There was way too much fat on that meat. The ugly: Reservations and seating. We sat on high chairs outside, the restaurant is small and packed. Uncomfortable high chairs is not my thing. If it wasn't for my wife I wouldn't bother to sit down and have dinner in these high chairs. (Same chairs inside and they reserve these)Clearly the chef was able to create the hype make this one of the 50 top in Asia but didn't live up to my expectations. Same or better quality food at a much better ambiance is available in Singapore at more reasonable prices.

They don take bookings except before 18.30. Bad.But we turned up around 9 and the place was full but they had two spaces outside. Good.Very interesting menu and wine list.I tried smoked quail egg with caviar for starter. Tiny but tasty.We both then had Onglet cooked in bone marrow and red wine. Awesomely tasty and good value at $26.We had some interesting orange wine and a good Aussie red.Staff are cool, fun and efficient
5
Dined here once, loved it but it's so hard to get a reservation - very pleased that they deliver through uber eats. They have a perfect combo for two that includes 2 sangers, 1 butter head lettuce, 1 berry tart and 1 bottle of sparkling water for $53. The pulled pork is so tender and juicy, the red cabbage and jalapeño peppers gives the burger a nice crunch and keeps it from being too rich, the buns are lightly toasted and not soggy. We have ordered twice and have been very pleased that the quality of the food is the same compared to the restaurant. This dish travels so well and we'll definitely be ordering again
5
One-of-a-kind concept in Singapore where almost all dishes on the menu are burnt, smoked, grilled... literally burnt. Had the Smoked Quail Egg with Caviar, that was a pop-in-the-mouth awesomeness. Super love the Burnt leeks as well as they were cooked to perfection, soft without it being mushy. Do try their beef as well such as the beef onglet, as its really tender. This is definitely a must-visit spot, and of course reservation is a must
4
Our Months of travel and only to unwind with great food at this restaurant... We are truly happy for the wait of 1 month reservation ahead and happier with the menu tonight and 3 of us had the flank steak, japanese bream and pulled pork burger with oysters galore and freeflow champagne! Great food, attentive bar and great value for $$$. Reservations in order as we will come back

Amazing place. Either you know it, because this has become a popular hang-out in a very short while. Or you do not know as you are not part of the scene. But give it a try as this is an amazing place for excellent food. You must like BBQ though. But not just any BBQ here, as they make there own charcoal in there double purpose oven. And it transpires though the dishes all the way. But do not come here without reservation!! There will be no seat for you. Service is professional and at a pleasant speed. Especially with the packed situation, the crew deserves a pat on the shoulder. Well done.Yes, some people may complain about some seating is cramped, but hey...this is also a bit part of the ambiance

Don't go there expecting professional service- We booked online, never got a confirmation email (but the online booking tool confirmed at the time). This booking system was obviosuly broken yet gave no such indication at the time- For days they didn't answer the phone or return calls while we tried to confirm our booking- When we arrived for our intended booking time we were confronted with a rude and unreasonable female member of staff at the door who wouldn't listen to our explanatio

Sorry guys, but to serve just a good piece of meet is not sufficient for this price!We arrived around 7 pm, as reservation was not possible, we tried and got 4 seats at the “bar” which is the area pointing away from the kitchen – you are sitting with the wall right in front of you face…… in addition, the aircon blew directly on our food….. and I was in a constant “Elbow-War” with my neighbour…people (staff and guest) were passing by constantly…The menu is (at least for a non-native English-speaking person) a closed book…. We needed for a lot of assistance from the servant – but as the noise level was quite high, this was also not very helpful. We ordered Wagyu beef and a sucking pig, the meet was very good but accompanied only by a small salad (pig). Be prepared that there are no meal accompaniments.We had to pay for the ordered bread in addition.If you are more than 2 persons it is advisable to choose another restaurant – with the seating (next to each other facing either the wall or the kitchen, except for some tables outdoor) and the noise (loud music what makes people speak louder….) makes it nearly impossible to keep up a conversation!Simply not enough for this price

It is so difficult falling in love with a restaurant and all of a sudden finding something else better that comes along. I hate to admit, but my experience here at Burnt Ends, definitely pushed this restaurant up there in my Top 5 fav, dining experiences. Be not mistaken, this is a quaint restaurant, that has an awesome ambiance, cool vibes, and the hard working chefs really put on a good show. It is spectacular seeing their rhythm and how each dish is meticulously tasted as it is passed along the lines until being served in front of you. The quality of the food is hard to match and I am easily becoming a food snob as Burnt Ends has really raised the bar for me.Certainly not cheap, and we waited a good 3 months before we finally got a table, but absolutely worth the experience. Highly, highly recommended

I came here on myLast Night ofA stop over on a recommendationAnd whatAn awesomeSpot! I arrived when it was very busy but as I was alone they quicklyFound me aSpot at the bar facing the kitchen. The atmosphere was full on but enjoyable! Staff were helpful and very professional. Even whenIt was packed the service was fast and efficient! I loved the pulled pork burger. One of the bestThings I've eaten, and the other thing my waiter suggested was also amazing. Can't remember what it was called but sticky meat with gherkins on top. Devine! HighlyRecommend aMeal at this place. I onlyWish I was with a larger groupSo could try moreItems!

Thank you to Sheena for assisting in my email booking. I was in town for the weekend from Dubai and my Sydney hospitality friends told me to definitely go. Open kitchen, casual atmosphere. Great trend for the idea that top rates restaurants are formal and stiff! My favourite dish was surprisingly not the meat, but the leek with burnt butter and hazelnuts! All I want to know is, how do I get to be good enough mates with Chef Dave to get an off menu bacon + egg sandwich?
4
food is very good, service is totally outstanding specially Ms. Sheena who gave us a very warm welcome. Ambiance is good but the chairs are not as comfortable.

Loved the whole vibe of the restaurant. Great comfort food. We booked the Chef's table which was nice and cosy but would love to try sitting at the counter next time.
Pulled pork burger was amazing!

"Disappointing and abject"....If there are two words to describe my dining experience at Burnt Ends then this is it. So firstly, the "Pro's:" Modern looking and cosy interior with exposed kitchen looks fantastic, simple and "to the point menu", great customer service, and *some* great cooking/desserts (such as the Jamaican chicken and crema and Flank steak, and the smoked mint and chocolate ice cream and buttercake with smoked ice cream). But, oh, the "Con's": Incredibly small portions with no value for money (a complete joke basically - the size of the Jamaican chicken was barely 1.5 x1.5 inches (and we only got 2 pieces for SGD 10), extortionate pricing ("one" minuscule smoked quail egg with a tiny dollop of caviar served on a tiny teaspoon for SGD 16 is unacceptable and daylight robbery, flank steak for SGD 26 per 100 g (which for this customarily cheap cut of steak is unacceptable) and, to top it off, they wanted about SGD 470 for 1kg of 45 day aged prime rib (which is significantly more expensive in most of the great steakhouses in the US or the UK that i have frequented)) and unacceptable quality of food delivery (the "pork belly chop" (SGD 24) we ordered was basically 95% pork fat with 5% meat, and the "sanger" pulled pork burger (SGD 20) was overpowered by coleslaw and mayo with barely enough pulled pork). Surprisingly on our dinner visit the place was rammed with expat workers from Australia and the UK - not sure how the expense at dining here is justifiable as cooking and portion sizes of this nature would never cut it in any of those countries. When the bill came, well... - just shameful from Burnt End
5
A fabulous concept and fresh , simple quality ingredients ... Food with a heart. So rare in Singapore. Portions are good and robust. Watching the food preparation is also interesting. The fish dishes r so fresh. The pulled pork bun a true winner. The reservations system is annoying but shows how good the place must be for me to put up with it ! A must ... Better than any so called "fine dining "restaurant is Singapore
5
Having lived in Singapore for many years I can say this is the best overall dining experience I have had here to date. All too often restaurants seem to somehow live of their reputations while charging high prices for mediocre food and service(sounds like an oxymoron I know). Burnt ends is casual with a lively buzz, Super friendly staff and amazing food all for a price that is not going to cause you to take out a second mortgage. You need to book in advance for the 6.00pm sitting or alternatively just turn up an put your name down for the second sitting which is what we done. At 7.30pm we got a call to say a space was ready. Seating is arranged as a counter in front of the kitchen plus some additional side seating. Try to get the counter-we were right in the center in front of the head Chef and his sidekick so got to see everything's being prepared. As the name suggests BBQ is the order of the day so if you are a vegetarian it may not be the best option although there are some interesting options. Everything on the menu that we tried was great but the Lamb Kebab and the Onglet were particularly amazing.For desert try the smoked ice-cream, unique flavour and very 'I want more'ish.As mentioned earlier the bill when it came was also a pleasant surpriseWe will be back!

I had waited so long to eat at Burnt Ends that when I had finally the opportunity to do so I was tinged with excitement. Unfortunately the excitement was gone by the time I finished the food. The portions are incredibly small the bill not so. I was offered a dish that was not on the menu a steak and frites, conjur up in your imagination what this would entail at a $35 dollar a serving price tag. What I actually received was a cube size potato a small quennele of wagyu beef tartare and a small amount of caviar. We had to order another 2 for the table at a total cost of $140. Please ensure your staff explain properly what dishes are this is something that was really lacking for a good standard restaurant. We had booked and as we sat at the end of the table felt a little out of the action, my chair was at the end of the bar so I constantly had to shuffle in to let the staff past. The food itself was very good, I cant criticise that the Beef marmalade was excellent as was the Onglet of beef. The suckling pig was just a foot with a lot of bone and very little meat. Ultimately I have ticked a box and will not go back again there are better restaurants in Singapore with better food and better value
5
Fortunate to get seats at the counter we felt like we were in the kitchen and a part of the cooking process. Watching flames come of out the ridiculously hot oven, the chefs raising and lowering the grills over the coals and the food being plated right in front of us was so much fun. Then you eat. My god, literally some of the best food around. The fish collar might have been the best fish I've ever had. The leeks come out black as charcoal but the insides are soft and drizzled with a brown butter sauce. Though known for their meat (it is a bbq restaurant) their sides and vegetables showcase the cooking and talent in the kitchen. Outstanding meal

I hear about this restaurant many times and we decided to give a try, impossible to make a reservation due to their policy, then we went straight to the restaurant and felt lucky to find a place outside.. Menu a bit difficult to understand, the waiter was nice to explain to us the menu and after 30 minutes we decided to order but not sure about what we were going to get.First course was a kind of marmalade with a few zucchini on the top, not bad but from that point I couldn't eat anything anymore, bone marrow was without bone and it came with a greasy piece of bread. A burger arrived with a red cabbage salad with a lot of sauce filled with some meat. the taste was there but again, my poor stomach couldn't handle it..salad with hazelnuts way too saucy, at this point I asked to the waiter if there was something more light in the menu and the answer was no. I couldn't really believe the answer and I insisted asking if it was possible to have a simple salad with on the side olive oil, lemon and some bread.. Thank god the chef that came out to understand the problem accommodated me and finally I could eat something... At the moment we were supposed to leave the table a last plate arrived.. Oh! I forgot that I ordered..The raclette! Cheese would be good we thoughtThe raclette cheese wasn't the traditional one, was a piece of semi-melted raclette cheese and that was good but the bread on the side.. BUTTERED!! Sorry now I am really picky: if you serve cheese, please don't forget to take out the paper from the crust! The bill? I didn't know I was invited.. My suggestion is: give some lighter options on the menu, I know the more there is fat the more it is good but there is a limit even on that. In my opinion this restaurant, from what I ate last night is a one star, but I know about the quality of the meat that they serve, it's a bit difficult to understand why they need an hour to cook it and it's probably for this reason that we didn't try it. Suggestion to the waiter, I know he was trying to sell the meat, but don't say that I will have the best meat in my life.. Come to Japan with me then!

Although at time of booking we were unable to secure front of kitchen table on arrival due to cancellation we were seated immediately infront of chef and kitchen. Food and service are top notch. Dining experience here was fabulous with food delicious and beautifully presented. A little pricey but certainly worth the experience Beautiful night and would recommend thi
3
The food here is sublime, without a doubt excellent steaks and the Sager pulled pork burger is to die for. But we waited over 3 hours to get a table here and they do not accept reservations. So after arriving at 6 we only managed to start dinner around 10. We wandered about and had some light bites at a Neighbouring restaurant Spanish tapas bar.Our total bill came up to $400 for 2 persons with some cocktails. We ended up spending alot more than that cos of the wait. So our final bill was more like 600 Singapore dollar
5
Thia is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Singapore. Everything I tried were different to anything I've tasted before and every dish is a work of art. Really amazing food. Remember to book ahead.
4
Great Grill. Booking in advance to avoid disappointment.
You can try walk in at 6pm without booking but be prepare that you will be missing the actions from the Chefs.
5
If you do anything in Singapore, make sure you go to this restaurant. Interesting face to face dining with some incredible chefs. Concept restaurant that goes the extra yard to deliver freshness and quality. Extraordinary chef with unbelievable capability. Don't miss it
5
We went to have a lunch, and the food was just so amazing!! The smoked quail egg with caviat is almoust a piece of heaven. Wine was tasty and the service was really friendly. The head chef is just a rockstar in the kitchen.
5
Wonderful culinary experience with high quality food and amazing presentation. It's great to watch the chef's prepare everything in front of you. Despite a full house they were amazingly clam and super organized. Their oven and bbq station is impressive. One of the "must return" restaurants here in Singapore
5
Burnt Ends is a very special place to eat . It's also a fun place to watch the chefs doing their jobs . The seating is along a bar type row. Seating is limited , so you will need reservations most likely. The chef offers some very creative dishes which you should try , but the barbecue pork sandwich is MUST!! We lived in Singapore for two years and split this sandwich every Saturday . This will be one of our first stops when we return. It's not inexpensive , but what is in Singapore . This food is worth every penny 
5
I had dinner at burnt ends and loved their food. They have a specialized oven to cook your meat perfectly. They will ask you how you like it and make it just perfect. I liked that they came and show me the piece of meat before cooking it. They also have an amazing burger. Portions are quite small but the tastes are here and that is what matters the most to me. They also have a good selection of wines ! Eat by the counter so you will feel you are in the kitchen. The restaurant is also perfectly located in Singapore, just in front of Potatoe Head rooftop bar for a last drink after diner 
5
We just loved our time at Burnt ends. From the minute we walked in the door we were looked after. The food was amazing - the cocktails - wow!! We can't wait to go back and try the meat dishes - we just couldn't eat anymore after trying our choice from the small plates!! Make sure you have a marshmallow - beyond words!

Came here for birthday treat. Overall food quality is good but some dishes are overrated. $15 per piece for a smoked quail egg with some caviar is not really worth it as it's not out of the world. Caviar is good. Bone marrow burger is soggy and very heavy in texture. It's like bread soaked with oil. I would prefer a thin toast with bone marrow. I wouldn't recommend this dish. Striploin is decent. Cooked to a perfect medium. Nothing less. It's good. Pulled pork burger is perfect. Flavour is well balanced but would be too heavy if eating alone. Jamaican chicken is richly flavoured with spices and grilled nicely over open flames. Nice smoky flavour. Only point to note is its actually 2 chicken wings. Nothing to shout about chicken wings.Service is ok but not good. Staff are not very attentive and never ask if the meal is fine. Didn't leave them with tips.
4
If you go here, we would recommend just to have a bite and a drink as it is very expensive. So if you want a full meal or lunch this is not the place to be. All dishes are small and very tasty but not filling. The concept of barbecuing is nice to see and well shown to the customers when sitting at the long bar. The pieces of meat they serve are very tasty but still expensive for what you get
5
Great food and experience. Highly recommended. Had multiple small plates and dessert - all of which was delicious! Pricey, but worth it.
5
Ok...before we get down to the review, let's get the booking system they have out if the way. You can book way in advance for a table at 6pm or 6.30pm, otherwise it is walk in, put your name down and wait. To everyone who's given bad reviews based on this, get over yourselves and do your research - it's a small restaurant with probably 30 covers and is very popular...for good reason. We emailed to book a table, got told there was nothing for 3 months so took our chances, got there just after 6pm, went for drinks around the corner and sat down to our seats around 8.30pm. The menu changes twice a day, but I expect a lot of the items are staples, in particular the beef marmalade which was fantastic. The room is laid out like a bar looking into the kitchen and only has one proper table, and with this layout it gives you a great view into the food being prepared and a chance to speak with the staff who are exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable which makes the experience even more enjoyable. We are a mixture of food from chicken neck to lamb kebab to marshmallows and all was superb
5
An amazing experience from beginning to end. Welcome by the chef and treated to whatever he felt like we were in for a exquisite tasting menu where every dish was melt in your mouth and delicious. Being on the counter and able to watch everything was fantastic and added to the drama. The service was excellent and the price reasonable. Perfect

Been six months since I visited Burnt Ends and all I can say is WOW. This place is the absolute business. There are few restaurants worldwide where you can go as a solo foodie and just sit there and admire people at work who's sole focus is to deliver plate after plate of consistent perfection.I was on a two night short stopover in Singapore, failing to get a reservation the first night I sent a begging and pleading mail for a place for the second evening before flying out. Sheena came through for me thankfully and I got the best seat in the house, right in front of the chefs prep table. No messing around, I went straight for the beef marmalade, followed by 100g of beef and the sanger to seal the deal. Unbelievable, just as I remembered it the last time. Ok fair enough I had the chocolate mint desert to finish off and walked out the door grinning like a Cheshire Cat.It really is worth the trouble to get a slot here, do yourself a favour leave the phone behind and focus on the team at work, watch out for the Aussie sense of humour from the head chef at play with some of the locals. It's priceless. Great atmosphere, great staff and definitely definitely worth flying halfway across the planet for.See you soon. "The Irishman needin feedin" :

We had a fab Friday lunch here and it rated in my top 5 meals. Ever. Anywhere. All share plates, terrific small number of choices, great service.We had the taramasalata grissini, chicken bites, tomatoes on toast and some seriously fab beef. All simple, perfect, tasty, perfectly cooked. Plus, magical toasted marshmallows and blueberry tart. These guys and gals can really cook. Sitting at the bench is like watching a really well oiled machine in motion. Totally deserving of all the accolades and awards. Great food without the pretentiousness.

My son picked a BBQ while on holiday in Singapore. I was expecting big place with mid priced food. Wow what a surprise. We arrived before 6 pm since the website told us it was a good idea. I figured that was a gimmick to get us there early. Then we arrived at this small hip restaurant with a great vibe. We were seated at Sharing table since bar seating overlooking the open kitchen was reserved. Each item we ordered was spectacular. From the chicken sampler to the chicken with thyme and black truffle to the burnt marshmallow to end. One of the best restaurants I have ever had the opportunity to visit.

The food here shows some promise (if you are prepared to overlook service) but the service is pretty much the worst we have experienced in a Singapore restaurant in several years here. We called ahead and were told it was a walk-in. When we walked in 5 minutes later, we were told the tables were all reserved and we should not have walked in. After some discussion and time elapsed, we got a high chair.When we ordered, the main course did not arrive (we had ordered Onglet Steak).The waiter then claimed we had ordered Burrata (hard to confuse with Steak !), and it would take a while to arrive. We asked for the cheque instead, as we didn't have the time (or any desire to eat Burrata). The bill had the in-ordered Burrata on it, which we asked to be removed. Upon which the Manager descended, offering no apology, instead insisting loudly that we pay for Burrata and why he was right ( and not the customer who placed the order). Extraordinary attitude.At this point we had had enough of this attitude problem, so we left. Plenty of other high quality restaurants in the area, eg Esquina next door.This restaurant has staff that need to learn manners and get some training.A real pity that the staff/service let down what is rumoured to be good food

We made a point of finding this place after it was recommended by a friend. It was a 20 minute walk from Clarke Quay in the Chinatown area.The restaurant was maybe 70% full we we racked up for a late lunch on Saturday. The menu takes a bit of figuring out - lots of cheffy descriptions - but we opted for the pulled pork with Asian slaw Sanger, farmers salad and some bread. Can only describe it as delicious. The Sanger was considered to be a starter but it was more than ample for lunch. Will definitely be looking this place up for dinner on our next visit.

Being inside Burnt Ends is like being transported into an industrial cavern screaming ‘Macho!’. Kitchen is open, so you are able to see the ‘show’ of food being prepared by a very slick team and also, for the chef and his sous to watch over the entire operation. I found that a bit daunting, there was a clear line demarcated by the bar where everyone dined, separating kitchen and guests, with little or no interaction. Observe and be observed. Food was expertly prepared to a very high standard. We had very fresh NZ oysters, Beef Marmalade with Pickles, Leeks with Hazelnut and Brown Butter, Steak with Marron Hollandaise and Potatoes. Wines were overpriced but service was good

Six of us went for dinner last night. It was amazing! Over ten courses and then dessert! I can't name a favorite but a few stood out such as the Steak Frites, Beef Marmalade and Pickles, Marron, Leek with browned butter and hazelnuts, and the Cracklins with Mustard! I also need to mention the Pork Sanger. I love it. Just the right amount of spice and cheese on this sandwich. All of us were happy and satisfied with everything we tried! The presentation was superb! My favorite dessert was the Blueberry Tart. The crust is fabulous! It's buttery and melts in your mouth! I highly recommend it. The beer selection is good. We had a cherry sour that was divine! It's a fun experience as you sit at a bar facing the open kitchen and can watch as they prepare all the dishes. The wood burning stoves and grills are impressive! Overall, it was a great dining experience and a relaxed place to go with friends. We will be back again and again for sure!

What can I say? Recommended by a good friend and Melbourne chef, arrived with very little expectation and then proceeded to be blown away by course after course by chef Dave Pynto. Thank you for surprising and entertaining us!

They really ought to improve their booking system. Emailed them on 30 May about having dinner on 3 Jun evening. There was no reply from them. For the next couple of days, I tried calling them but the line was either disconnected or diverted to the voicemail. Hence, I decided to try walk-in since it is stated on their website that customers can try that. They were fully booked. No surprises there
5
We were here because of good recommendations from friends. No reservations entertained, just show up and wait. Come early as early as 5.30 pm for dinner or you gonna wait long. Good service at two long tables, one row bar style and the other row facing the open kitchen so you can watch the cooks preparing your food. Very nice food indeed. Very good sourdough bread to dip in the leek and Norwegian giant crab dishes.

Burnt Ends SG has got to be one of the best restaurants I have tried in my seven years in Singapore. Everything about it, from staffing, ambience and of course, the food, was exemplary.Some of the best produce and innovative recipes I have ever had the pleasure to taste.A big thank you to David Pynt and Keirin Buck and their team for their hospitality tonight.A 'why did we eat so much' face for Caitlin Murphy. Tonight was a laugh. Thank you friend

We were a party of two and walked up. They'd had a no-show so we got to sit at the long table where you can see all the theatre of the restaurant's kitchen and prep areas. We simply said to the head chef - "Feed us". The food came at regular but well spaced intervals, and there was not one single thing that was less than excellent.It is an expensive place to eat but the meal will definitely be memorable. If you can stretch your budget to something that is about $35 for a two-bite mouthful, try the steak frites - an interesting take on steak and chips.Overall a meal that successfully impressed me with it's creativity, and also successfully eliminated any ideas i might have had about a midnight snack that night

Dinner for 2. Walk in.I have been listening to everyone mention "Burnt Ends" for awhile. Perhaps I was expecting a little too much hence it turned out to be a little disappointing. The energy of this restaurant is awesome. The layout allows you to see majority of the food prep. It was very entertaining seeing the team in action. However, the service was casual and average.Cocktails were good. Food was a little varied. The quail egg and caviar starter was rather subdued. Then came the Beef Marmalade....it was really good. The Garlic stalk was beautifully presented and I enjoyed the "citrus zing" to the dish. The Sanger didn't leave a deep impression on us and the Steak with Marrow was waaaaaaaaaaay too over seasoned.....the clusters of salt was overwhelming for us.....and our palettes lean more towards to salty side. Perhaps an isolated mistake.Overall, it was fantastic....but we enjoyed the meal, we enjoyed the ambiance. It was not too overly priced
5
Had dinner here with a friend in May '16. Didn;t have a reservation, they suggested we come back for the second sitting to get a grill facing seat, which we gladly did. Menu is fantastic. Besides a novel way of preparing and cooking the meat. The menu itself was fantastic, the portions were tailored. Though not cheap - in Singapore stands found the pricing very reasonable. Food was really fantastic. Wine list and pairing was excellent. Highly recommend this place. However not if you are looking for a quite / or romantic evening

I can say that this is without a doubt one of the best meals we had in Singapore so far in 2016. I half expected this place to be a full-on BBQ joint (lots of ribs, sausages, burnt ends), but it is not. It's different... more 'sophisticated', and it's good. The 'Sanger', which is essentially pull porked, house made coleslaw, pickles, stuffed between two buns with melty cheese goodness, is to die for. It's the best sandwich / burger we've had in Singapore. 9.5/10 type stuff. If we didn't already order so much of the other dishes, we'd probably order this one again.The beef marmalade on toast and the Jaimacan chicken were both delicious. The king crab with brown butter was nice, and mopping up the garlic brown butter with the Burnt Ends sourdough bread is a must (we almost passed on it when asked, but thankfully made the right decision before it was too late). The rump + bone marrow was over the top... maybe too much. I felt like my arteries would clog up and my heart explode, but the flavors and texture are spot on... just make sure you have room left in your stomach!We'd take a pass on the bone marrow bun though.Ended off the night with the blueberry and apple tart, and it was perfect to cap it off. Not too sweet, it's one of the better dessert's we've had in awhile at a restaurant in Singapore. We'd probably buy the entire tart and bring it home if we could.Overall, the service was casual, friendly, attentive, and really quick.Definitely a must try restaurant in Singapore. Just go. Already. And order the Sanger. Just make sure you make reservations. We made ours some 3 weeks in advance and we noticed that the moment the restaurant opens it's doors it's filled up

This is my second time to Burnt Ends - the first did not go well as they forgot our reservation and wanted to sit us by the door, so we left.Second time hopeful, we came back again. Made reservations at 8:30pm and got a call at 7:45pm that our seats are ready. We were still having pre-dinner drinks elsewhere and messaged back that we will be there at our reserved time (no response back from the restaurant).We arrived at 8:30pm sharp and were informed that our seats were not ready, we had to wait for about 20 mins. Some work clearly needs to be done on their reservation process to make it less painful and respectful of patrons.However, after we were seated, the magic begins.We ordered a bottle of wine, the recommended appetisers, small plates and also their best steak (1.42kg shared by 3 of us). All the food that came were good and the steak, was simply divine - amazing flavors were packed into the meat.We ended the meal with toasted marshmellows (smores) which are highly recommended.The bill came up to about S$380 per person, which is not cheap, but the quality of the food made up for the price

We went there yesterday eve and had a super moment there. The food was delicious and the spot Royal.We had several dishes ( every dished are cooked and made to be share) and here are our must to order which were DELICIOUS!!!- Beef and marmalade with pickles ( one of the best thing I have ever ate)- burrata with fennel and orange- lam ribs- home burger- leak with butter sauceThe food, cocktails and mocktails are made in front of you on an open kitchen where you can enjoy from the counter!!Definitely our next kitchen :-
5
Excellent food, great flavors..huge grill..sit at the bar watch the chefs at work..great steaks. I will be back again when I am in Singapore
5
Fantastic atmosphere with great staff and wonderful food. One of the faves was the crackling and mustard. Wine list is a tad on the expensive side but a good selection nonetheless.
5
Lovely food with friends - couldn't have enjoyed the evening more. Staff couldn't be more attentive and loved the open kitchen. Great location too for drinks
4
Small open kitchen which is very popular. If you get here early you should be able to get a seat at the open bench overlooking the chefs but if you turn up after 8 you will probably struggle to get a seat. The restaurant is small and intense (in a good way). Everything is cooked using wood coals on a variety of ovens/grills. You watch the chefs cook and they are calm, efficient and interactive.As for the food.... Simply awesome. We had leak with hazelnut and burnt butter sauce, braised beef, Jamaican chicken and the signature dish pulled pork bun! Dishes were small (apart from the pork bun) very well priced and delicious. The chefs take a lot of pride in their work and it is evident. Only issue I had was the drinks menu... Beers were very limited and very expensive and a bottle of wine was well over $100. Settled for tap water in the end
5
Burnt Ends is my absolute FAVOURITE restaurant in Singapore! I would eat there everyday if I could ...The food is simple, fresh and unpretentious. I love polishing my plate of leftover drippings with their sourdough bread. Simply divine!! Must I mention, the food is so delicious, my mum who never orders a second glass of wine to accompany her meal broke the norm!! The ambience is casual and fun. It's up to one whether or not you want to dress up or down for this lovely little eatery. Looking forward to my next meal at Burnt Ends ...
5
We'll done on the flavors. Tasty beef, amazing leek and good wines.Pricy, but you do get good food.All dishes were happy shrprises.If you take beef, skip the rump and take any other one, it does make a difference. Unfortunately also in price.Seating is a bit cramp at a long bar and if you are with a group more than 2, its not really social to sit in a row. If you're single, it's easier to mingle and you do see all action in the kitchen. Enjo

Stop over for quick lunch on Friday by myself since I am around the neighbourhood and been hearing about all the hype at Burnt ends. To my surprised the restaurant was fully booked even I went in quit early on Friday noon (around 12am) but apparently all the seats are booked and I can only share a table with another patron outdoor. Which is okay for me. But I am excited since it's so packed and I am assuming the food would be very good.To me the most important thing is the food that's why I think Burnt Ends is overrated for their food and it wasn't stand up to the par. Since I am alone, I only ordered ( recommended by the staff)the beef marmalade and pull Pork burger. The beef marmalade is way better than the pull pork burger. The beef were tender and flavourful (but a bit heavy on the salt but still acceptable for me) and it goes well with the toasted sourdough & condiments well with pickles & chopped chives. However, I was very disappointed by the pull pork burger, I can only have 2 bites of it, couldn't even finish it. it's very very salty, the pull pork was overpowered by the sauce and can't really taste the pork at all, the cabbage do help a bit to counter the oiliness & saltiness of the overall taste but I can't even make myself past my second bite. the sauce also make the bun turn soggy real quick.The restaurant could have improve on their customer services more, I was greeted & served by a lovely lady but the guy that take over her after wasn't friendly at all. Didn't even smile or say much when I asked for my bill, also he saw I left a whole plateful of the burger and didn't even bother to ask if there's anything wrong with the food. That point of time, the restaurant wasn't very busy and half the restaurant was empty, so I think it's very important for a restaurant to train its staff to be friendly & be proactive in getting customers feedback. Sometime a great customer services could make up when the food is not up to the par. For this Burnt Ends does not have either both.

I am torn on this one. The food is terrific - wonderfully evocative barbecue beef flavors from a giant custom-built oven set-up, absolutely delicious Jamaican chicken starter, really nice flavors - if you did not have to deal with "other things," definitely deserving of it's top 50 inclusion in Asian restaurants, I imagine. As for “other things,” if you dig around online, you'll discover that they have a chaotic approach to getting a table. There are many restaurants that say, "no reservations." There are some that say, "some reservations, the rest are first come, first serve." It is unfortunate, however, to see stories from many customers about selective entry to the "first come, first serve" list, where wait lists are already populated before you get there at their supposed 6 PM starting point for their wait list. Is it actually a line? Or, in fact, like an exclusive club, a popularity/fashion/do-you-know-the-owners club? Not very nice - unless you actually like that sort of thing. I did not have this problem - I ended up being able to enter as advertised, although I prudently showed up at 5:45 to line up, instead of the declared 6 pm time. (There were people before me – be warned!) There are literally a handful (OK, maybe 6) of these open seats facing a wall away from the chef's kitchen within the restaurant, a few more outside in "sunny, warm, moist, fun" Singapore weather (many love that!). Just so you know. A reservation, hard to get, would get you a lovely table facing the kitchen to see everything being prepared – a terrific show, if you can plan far enough ahead (multiple weeks). There is also a Chef's Table, if you have a group - worth exploring as well, presumably with even more notice.Still, I did have non-food issues. A member of the waitstaff brought me my lovely piece of raw meat for review, but informed me it was 125g, not the 100g that I had ordered. That was interesting – even my own local butcher at home doesn’t miss by that much – and since they had a scale, they surely could have trimmed it to what I ordered. Were they worried it was too much meat, and I might not be able to get through it? I had no way to verify the weight, of course – I just agreed. And at bill-paying time, I had to pay 25% more for the meat - that part was not revealed to me during the theater of meat-display. The higher bill was, presumably, the point of the whole performance, by adding to the most expensive part of the meal. I was also charged Sing $11 when I ordered tap water. Hmm - not the end of the world, but when asked, "Would you like water?” I'd like to know the rest of the sentence, ". . .at 10,000 times the cost of what comes out of our tap?" The wine by the glass was terrific - I would have foregone the $11 for water to help pay for it, if I'd only known. Putting this together, you see a restaurant that is absolutely stellar on the flavors, but a hint of unscrupulous on the logistics and financial basics. (I admit - I even checked on the way out to see if I'd been overcharged for a glass of wine as well - I had not. Unless, of course, the menu put near the door has different prices than the one they use at tables. . . See what the billing (not dining) experience did to me? ;-) ) You decide. Great food, devil take the logistics and pricing

Never disappointed with the feast at Burnt Ends in Singapore. Not easy to get seat as it's quite small, but that adds to the experience as you are sitting facing the team preparing the meal, including the owner and chef David. They are happy to let you eat and drink until late (we left after midnight). Constantly changing menu depending on whats in season and available at the markets. The pulled pork burgers are the best and the king crab is also fantastic - to many good dishes to mention
4
It was a walk in so we didn't get seats at the main table. The bar counter was a bit narrow but it's okay considering how small the space is. The concept of the restaurant is very precise and it is reflected in the menu. The food is not overly creative but it's in the right place. The whole restaurant makes sense: the food, the open kitchen, the smokiness, the Chef standing there with his butcher's apron.Most of the dishes are good: duck heart peri-peri, beef pickled marmalade, onglet and bone marrow, the low point for us was the leeks and hazelnut - having heard so much about it we were expecting something out of the worldly good / creative. I will come back for the sangers. Dining here is definitely pricey but the sanger - hands down the best around and also well priced.
5
Another expat Australian chef doing great things overseas. A creative menu with lots of flavours, and a wine list to compliment. Must try!
5
Every dish was delicious. We especially liked the pulled pork sanger and beef marmalade. The fennel, orange, burrata was a great side dish and the onglet was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend Burnt Ends!
5
Trendy restaurant setting you can easily find in Sydney lately. very well trained staffs. i ordered medium well done venison and beef, they came perfectly cooked. Leek was very soft and flavourful. Will definitely visit again.
5
Dishes like Beef Marmalade, XO Scallops, Leek and Lamb Ribs were packed with flavour. The 45 day dry aged beef was absolutely phenomenal but was really expensive. The other dishes are all pretty affordable and reasonably priced. For a Friday night it was fairly crowded, we had to sit outdoors, and the table was a long table with seats on one side, so it was not too conducive for conversation. Other than that, service was fairly prompt and food was delicious

Burnt Ends, owned by chef-restaurateur Andre Chiang is currently ranked No.14 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2016. With Australian Chef Dave Pynt on the pass, Burnt Ends have caused quite a stir in the Singapore food scene with their incredible barbeque.During my trip to Singapore, I did not have the intention of visiting this restaurant and therefore did not make any reservations. But when I was looking at Singapore’s Burpple Top 100, Burnt Ends was at the top and I just had to give it a try one way or another.With only 17 coveted counter seats, it was quite a challenge to secure a place in their restaurant. So when I tried to make a reservation during the same week, of course they were fully booked. Luckily, there are walk-in options for people that could not get a reservation.When we arrived, we were fortunate enough to snag two seats right at the end of the counter! We were so thrilled to try out what they have to offer.The way Burnt Ends operate differs from other restaurants. Approximately half of the counter seats oversee an open kitchen that is dominated by a four-tonne, dual cavity oven fired by fragrant apple and almond wood. You can also feel the hustling vibe of all the chefs and watch them as they skillfully prepare your food. I wished we were seating there instead. It would have been a totally different dining experience.We were very satisfied with the food as well as their service. Their Onglet steak was perfectly cooked and flavours were incredible. Their Burnt Ends sanger burger with pulled pork was also amazing. Too bad there was only so much we could eat (and limited funds). There was so much more that we wanted to try on their menu – their Squid, Venison, King Crab, Seabass, it all sounds really good! They have clearly mastered their barbecuing technique and their dishes are very affordable. Until this day I am still dreaming about their perfect-rare onglet steak. I look forward to return to Burnt Ends again.For a full review, please visit eatsleepliverepeat.com/2016/03/30/burnt-ends-singapor

This is by no means a formal restaurant but the food experience is five star. The leeks for example become memorable, the fish is outstanding, so is the meat.Such a festival of the senses with a smooth service timed just right. At the counter it is a delight to follow the chefs skills. Not for soulful conversation though but delightful evening for sure
2
No reservation possible which made it difficult to get in with 4 pax. Food clearly overpriced. Chefs recommendation Suckling pig wasn't available already at 8.30pm. My dessert wasn't available too. Lame excuses and only offer to receive marshmallows on the house or to come back and they will make up for all dissatisfaction. Typical Singapore food scene, restaurant has been hyped and isn't able to deliver a decent standard
5
Fantastic BBQ food. For starters, we had their Beef with Mustard, Jamaican Chicken, and Quail Egg with caviar. I will strongly recommend the first two, and skip the egg with caviar - for just one spoonful, it wasn't worth $15. The beef and chicken were done perfectly, especially the chicken; I have never had such good and juicy chicken before.For mains, we had their Burnt Ends Sanger (pulled pork burger), beef onglet and grilled venison. The venison was good, but compared to the burger and beef, I would skip it. The beef was wonderfully tender, flavourful, and again, perfectly grilled. The burger is also the best pulled pork burger I have ever had, and is a good stomach filler for a relatively low price ($20), since the food here isn't considered cheap
3
Went there with 10 friends/colleagues recently.After all the fuss of getting a booking it was very over rated and I would have to say very pretentious.The staff were great, the wine excellent but expensive and the food very strange. The oysters were the best part particularly the warm ones which I normally don't like but these were very good.It ended up costing us about $220 each and I for one left feeling done
5
I reserved lunch seats for 4 people and the reservation system went off without any hitch. On the day itself, we arrived a bit earlier than the schedule but the staff still accommodated us. They gave us good recommendations on what to order and were very attentive to our group.Food was definitely the star though. I think the price justifies the quality and the freshness so it was ok to spend a bit more than usual. Will definitely come back again
5
A quick business visit dinner for me. Didn't make a reservation and was fortunate enough to get a seating on a packed night. Great service and food. Easily one of the best food experiences for me.
5
most enjoyable place,great open kitchen.love the food,cocktail,all divine,be back for sure
and yes you have to queue,so what,queue, have a drink when you do, and just wait for your table
5
I only give five stars to places that really deserve it - Burnt Ends deserves it.The food leaves you tingling. The service is impeccable. The choices of wines and beers are fantastic. And the price is reasonable. The only downside is the toilet isn't immaculately clean, but this is a very minor criticism of a great restaurant. It is a small place and it's hard to get in. If you walk up without having added your name to the waitlist, you could be seated either outside or on a small shelf inside, which some will not find comfortable. The menu may confuse less adventurous or open-minded diners

I guess it's very highly rated since the cooking is a bit 'exotic' for westerners. For me, a Chinese from China, some cooking method is similar to Chinese or Cantonese barbecue which you can easily find in local restaurants in China. The Chef might have found a lot of his new ideas in China or HK :)Service is great. They are passionate, patient and helpful. Changing plates frequently before you ask. Very attentive. The quail egg with caviar, only one single quail egg, costs $15, this pricing is not friendly. It's with soft liquid yolk though, just like Japanese Spring egg.I like the beef marmalade and another dish (I forget the name =.= ) yoghurt with spring onions on thin crispy chip is also great. Different flavours are nicely mixed with a bit crisp to enlighten your bites. Bone marrow bun is an interesting combination, worthy of a try for marrow lovers! Note that there is some acid added inside (vinegar or juice I'm not sure), see if you like it. I personally would prefer the old salt and pepper taste :) scallop in XO sauce is good also. I don't quite get the idea of leek.. It's oily. The super crab leg, it's huge. But the crab meat is a bit watery, not sure if it's after de-frozen. The cooking is the Chinese Spring onion oil type. It's so huge that it gets cold before you finish ==Overall it's a decent restaurant and can visit for leisure time. It's a bit surprising for me though that it's Asian's top 50.

I decided to surprise my wife for our 30th wedding anniversary and booked two weeks in advance.We were seated directly in front of the kitchen and let David, the chef choose our food. We were not disappointed. From the Smoked Quail Egg Cavier to the Mayura Cube Roll, finishing with dessert and marshmallow, each of the 8 courses were magnificent.Added to this was the ability to observe the entire staff working in unison to prepare and serve each of our courses.Whilst expensive, the food and experience were certainly value for money.We will be returning on our next visit to Singapore
5
We had heard about Burnt Ends, but only got the chance to try it out on Thursday night - prompted by hearing the news it had been awarded a Top 50 Restaurants in Asia award (#14). We arrived as a group of 4 at around 8pm, and managed to get seated within minutes - the space is small, and it is pretty much all bar seating (there was at least one table for larger groups). The bar seating is great, but probably better suited to couple dates. We managed to meet the chef Dave who took charge of the dishes for us - everything was amazing, really exceptional food. We had a mixed bunch of eaters with one who doesn't eat meat, and another that doesn't eat seafood - but we managed to have delicious plate after plate, with variations where necessary for dietary requirements. You could taste the quality and care that had gone into sourcing the produce and cooking it accordingly. Service was a highlight - often hard to come by in Singapore. Really good wine list as well. Will be going back again soon

Ashlee arranged with a friend for us to visit Burnt Ends for dinner to celebrate Josephine's birthday.We were lucky to get it as it was so full. The restaurant is relatively small and you mainly sit at the bar looking at the 10 chefs work very hard to prepare dinner for everyone. The chefs don't stop working the entire time we were there, makes you hungry just watching them !! We had a range of starters which were delicious and the steak for mains very delicious and tender. Perhaps the chicken entree was a little under done for me as it was a little red inside see photo. Following all of that the restaurant brought out a small cake and some chocolates for my wife.Very nice evening though and everyone enjoyed themselves

I haven't written a review before but this was such an incredible night, I feel like its the least I can do. After extensive research I chose dinner at Burnt Ends to propose to my girlfriend. The experience was amazing from the very start. Everyone made a huge effort from the time we walked in the door, we starting with champagne then we left it to the brilliant Chef Dave Pynt to arrange ten courses that were unlike anything we'd eaten before, and we've tried a few! The size of each dish was perfect and allows you to experience so many amazing tastes. After 10 courses and a bottle of Shiraz we really tried but just couldn't get through all 3 deserts. When my girlfriend said this was some of the best food she'd tasted, I knew after a few shots, there was no better time to propose... and she said yes!We went to 3 other fine dining restaurants after this and they just didn't compare to this amazing dining experience.Highly Recommend

We tried this restaurant couple days ago. Its fully booked even on weekdays. Majority of guest were western people which means its tourist place to hangout. We tried some appetizer and main course, they are good but a little bit salty. Important note that the mineral water is not free!! We didnt notice that the mineral water is $11 per bottle. Then when we saw the bill, yes the most expensive was still water. We spend $44 for still water? Whatt?! We were surprised coz usually restaurant in singapore give it as free..

Out of curiosity I decided to try this restaurant for lunch on a Saturday. Fortunately I could get a (second to last) seat without reservation. Almost 3 years old, this place continues to be a favorite in Singapore, thanks to the modern BBQ creations by its Australian chef. The bartender/sommelier happens to be an Aussie, too.I must say that the food didn't exactly blow me over. The much-talked about sanger (pulled pork sandwich) was quite underwhelming for me, as the meat was too soggy and rather bland. The onglet, on the other hand, was so salty that I had to wash it with beer after each bite. The best dish for me was the venison with cranberry, and the dessert - a light, freshly baked berry crumble.Still I give this a "very good" rating because I liked the casual-chic place, the friendly service, and the selection of drinks on offer. So I might give it another go, if I visit Singapore again and feeling particularly meat-hungry

If you enter the restauarnt...the smell of good food wont let you lease any more.
We had a Chefs choice menu-selected by chef Dave...it was outstanding..."Foodporn"
If I would live in Singapore...it would be one of my top 3...favourite
Well done...please continue

Great place if you like bbq food, serving up a different kind of bbq in Singapore. Great place to chill and catch-up with friend. Close on certain day (check their website), good food with price to match. Reservation is a must as seating is limited
5
A complete delight and uncomparable flavours. This place needs to be in the league of Michelin Star restaurants. It is quite brave with its open kitchen and it is a pleasure watching the chefs at their creative best. Must try their steaks, beef pickles and pork Sanger. The aged cocktails are to die for. Die die must try place
5
We were recommended this place by a friend who recently visited so expected it to be good, but we were blown away by the excellent, food, theatre and friendliness of the staff. You sit at a bar facing the cooking station so can see all the prep and cooking of the food. 90% is done over charcoal and the smells are awesome. The most impressive thing was the amazing teamwork with Dave and the other chefs - whilst it was really busy, they worked effortlessly to deliver the most amazing experience. How they knew what needed doing next was a mystery! We had smoked quails egg, lamb ribs in soy, marron in beurre blanc and suckling pig. The flavours of all dishes were utterly exquisite and it was really hard to pick our favourite - we think the marron just nicked it as it was cooked so perfectly. Hard to stop using superlatives but would recommend this as a must do in Singapore.

I was so desperate coming from Hong Kong to try this restaurant. We arrived on the Saturday at 5.30pm , 30 mins before opening still to find 13 people in front of us on the wait list. Disappointed yes however, after a while decided to eat outside rather than wait the 3 hours stated as the wait time . First lesson don't compromise .. I would suggest going away and get seated inside.We tried a variety of dishes (pictured). I think at $15 the single smoked quail egg is overpriced but tastes good. I liked very much the marmalade beef and I thought the crackling was decent.Everyone raves about the pulled pork bun with red cabbage but I felt personally it was under seasoned and the bun soggy.Good place and next time I will book a year in advance to secure a place but I'm not feeling the love.Top 50 in Asia - I don't think so on first experience

I will never forget this place, if only for the cost! I'd read good reviews and as a self described "Modern Australian Barbeque offering casual dining" I thought it would be perfect for a steak with a friend after a couple of drinks. I wasn't looking for Michellin starred fine dining but that is what we ended up paying ... We arrived at 9.30pm on a Friday night without a reservation. Given it's popularity I wasn't surpised that we had to wait - no worries, we had a drink outside for 45 mins or so. When we did move inside we were first shocked by the price of the steaks, and then by the time we were told it would take to cook ..... In the end we ordered a beef rib steak to share. It was big and tasty, but to be honest I've had better, and never before have I had to pay close to SGD$600 (Â£300!) and wait more than 1 hour for it to be cooked! Our casual meal for 2 that should have cost SGD$400 ended up costing SGD$1002.60

Already a success story in Singapore, Burnt Ends offers only the finest and freshest produce, cooked to perfection. This was our first visit after having heard about it before arriving. We booked 6 weeks ago - so get organised and get yourself a booking. It is small and seemingly impossible to get in to without booking at busy times. We sat at the long bench looking straight into the open kitchen and saw everything we ate prepared. Fantastic. We worked our way through the menu with many highlights, but the marron, the NZ venison and the Australian sandwich ( sanger ) were incredible. We had a couple of Australian wines expertly matched by their Sommelier - who is a scientist - literally ! A touch of class with great attention to detail. Felt like home - so we went back 2 days later and just had the 'sanger'. Heaven
5
Following the recommendation of the Asia 50 best I give a change to this restaurant.I went there with some question of this new kind of restaurant of serving food philosophy.... A few experiences like this on can change your habit.It is amazing straight forward but right to the point and worth it.Good atmosphere, charismatic chef but professional and concentrated
5
Best grills in town! In several visits, asked the chef to cook what he thinks is best for me and my friends and it's absolutely great! A must dine and go to place in SG, just prepare to smell like BBQ after dining. Totally worth it!
5
What a great place to spend a rainy afternoon..Service, Food and conversation were great Saturday..the menu selection was out of this world and cooked to perfection. I tried many items and loved them all, the chef takes great pride in his product and it shows. This will be one of my regular spots in Singapore from now on
5
What an experience! This restaurant is an absolute experience! The chef is so interactive with the customers. The food is world class and so is the atmosphere. Loved it ! Brilliant
4
Had some great pulled pork sandwiches one lunchtime while nursing a hangover. Unfortunately they don't sell fries and only had salads on offer as sides. Who wants a salad when hungover!??!?
5
This was our second visit to Burnt Ends but our first time sitting at the chef's table and we were not disappointed. We had13 shared dishes and the food was awesome. Service was brilliant -friendly, prompt and unobtrusive. One of our guests was a pescatarian and they went above and beyond to cater for her needs. Will certainly visit again on our next visit
5
What an amazing night we had! We had the $125++ menu and it was incredible! There were many favourites but a couple really stood our. Loved the Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar, Beef Marmalade and Pickles, Tomato and Lardo Toast, Venison and the Toriyama Flat Iron.Such a memorable meal, made even better by the attentive and friendly staff! Cannot wait to get back to Singapore to return!
5
One of the best restaurants i've tried in awhile. I wasn't able to book ahead but got lucky getting a seat as a walk in. Everything from the lobster to the oysters to the steak and pulled pork sandwhich each done with a Burnt Ends touch was delicious
1
Tuesday night, can't book, so advised to walk up and put name down. Did this around 7pm and got a call back for a table near 10pm. Sorry guys, if it takes you 3 hours to get a table and can't book I'll take my money elsewhere.
5
Loved the fact that it's a walk in friendly restaurant and it provides a high end menu; a real gem for any city. The service was very attentive and the chef/owner makes a real effort to have a chat with all his customers. We went for the beef marmalade (to die for), the homemade sourdough bread and the suckling pig. This was followed by the banana hotdog and the mint choc icecream. We were so satisfied from the first mouthful. The free marshmallow and chocolate were a nice touch at the end. Will definitely go back on our next city break to Singapore
5
I cannot say enough good things about this place! It was amazing food, great service and I loved the atmosphere!First things first - getting a table. With all the reviews on wait times we arrived just before 6pm when it opened (especially as we were dining on Saturday night). We were therefore relatively high on the waiting list (in fact we were offered the option to eat straight away if we wanted to sit on stools but the dining experience is that much better if you can sit along the main bench and watch the chefs do their work!). We gave them our number and were told we would likely be called between 8 - 9pm but it could be later, they were very clear and open about it. As it happened they called us at 7.15pm for a table at 7.30pm.There are a lot of reviews complaining about wait time - it seems pretty obvious when you go that if you are coming with a group of more than 2, there is likely to be a lot of variability and risk of a long wait as its a small space and when you get the call up depends on when other diners finish their meal and there being sufficient space for your party. For groups I would recommend coming only if you've made a reservation. Apparently groups of six or more are served the chefs menu of that day (with options to provide indications to the chef in advance of what food you prefer). As for the food - it was incredible. We had the beef marmalade to start, do yourself a favour and order this, it was incredible! We had the ham, honey and mustard and it was good (but had nothing on the beef marmalade). It seems with the starters/ small plates that they sell out during the evening so an earlier dinner spot is likely to ensure greater availability.For the mains we had the pork sanger, which at $20 is an absolute steal, and the onglet which was cooked to perfection. There is quite a range in price of the meals - but you could certainly select options that are on the cheaper side (and then there are some very pricy dishes!).The service here was absolutely stand out, from the staff who greet you, to our waiter who was very chatty and helpful in recommendations and the chefs who interact with you while they cook and serve you the food directly. My husband and I were both incredibly impressed at how relaxed the team was in the kitchen and how they were able to interact with diners during our meals.To top it off it was our honeymoon so the chef kindly gave us a few complimentary desserts (the marshmallows are incredible, at $2 definitely get a couple!!)We will definitely be back and recommending this to anyone who is coming to Singapore!Tip - pop across the road to the library for cocktails while you wait...

Came here by myself without any reservations. Luckily, there were still a few seats available. The ala carte menu was limited and since I wanted to have a little bit of everything, I opted for the tasting menu. Every dish was done well and delicious. I couldn't even finish the food anymore so I had my dessert to go. It's worth a visit when in Singapore. A tad pricey but totally worth it. My absolute favorite was the flat bread with, lemon, creme fraiche and shaved pollock roe and the bone marrow brioche was heavenly. Spent a little more than $200 for the tasting menu and 2 glasses of wine. Would definitely go back
5
Honestly best meal I've had in Singapore. We had to wait an hour for a table since it's a tiny joint that only takes reservations for 2 slots per night (and evidently people like to sit there forever). Pulled pork sanger is a MUST TRY and I don't even normally like pork burgers. OP Ribs were fantastic, best thing I ever tasted and I'd order it all the time if not for the hefty price tag. Great atmosphere as you sit right across from the kitchen.The only underwhelming order was the burrata with leek. Try the house salad instead. For dessert we had the banana with whisky and it was to die for as well.
5
Thank you for a lovely Friday lunch. My wife and I were very well looked after by Chef Dave. He chose our menu, fantastic food, cracking wine and a very knowledgeable cook.
All round a superb experience and we will certainly be back! :))
5
We were lucky enough to sit at the chefs table and had a great night.
Excellent food, we had a set dinner menu, paired with great wines, brilliant- genuine service from our red socked host!
Will definitely be back.

Had a fab lunch with friends , great food , fantastic atmosphere, excellent staff but have to admit the bill was a trifle scary !!!
5
Burnt Ends delivers with delicious food, good service and a unique setting / a must visit in Singapore.
Have been there already 3 times, and I will continue going there several more times.
Charcoal rocks!
5
OMG. Best restaurant in Singapore hands down. We let the chef decide what we would have and every course surpassed the last. I'm in awe.
4
Even for Singapore, I was a bit shocked by the pricing at Burnt Ends. We stopped by for a late night meal on Saturday after trying to grab a late dinner at a few places nearby that were no longer serving food. My husband had been previously, but I hadn't, although I've been dying to go. We didn't order much, but everything we had was excellent, especially the pulled pork. The beer and wine we ordered were overpriced and disappointing. I'm not sure we'll be back. If we'd had a proper meal with wine the bill would have been astronomical, I'm sure
1
Came in quite late on a Friday with no booking so my bad. The staff was so unfriendly that I don't think it is acceptable. Maybe worth to have someone at the door that know about how to take care of customers and keep them happy (wether you have a table or not). Good luck
5
Hands down best restaurant in town. A real surprise in Singapore. The dishes are mesmerising and brilliantly put together. The atmosphere in the restaurants is Ozzy cool with interaction between chefs and guests while you're enjoying your food and glass of wine. Go and experience it for yourself! You won't be disappointed... that is if you can get a seat
5
A local dragged us here saying he knew we would love it. We take our meat as part of the meal, not as its main point, and this place sounded like some sort of a fancy steak place, so we went reluctantly. Fortunately we went! We had lots of yummy dishes, were not overwhelmed by meat (of course part of that was due to our careful ordering), were impressed by the sophistication of the dishes - not just beef on the barbecue - and recommend it heartily. Quite an "in" place, crowded, limited seating, noisy, but with a happy vibe that was fun to share. Good wines, good wine and food advice from the staff
5
Yes I'm Australian but that doesn't mean I go in search of so-called 'Australian food' when I travel - (a) because there isn't any such thing and (b) because mostly the last thing I want when I am travelling is a reminder of home! The only Aussie thing about this place is the Chef and I can't claim responsibility for him, but I can sure talk him up lol. The star of this place is FIRE and my, oh my, what a difference that makes to the taste of food. On our second visit here we worked our way through a few more menu items and overall, it was impressive. I just love watching the chefs at work, it's like reality TV only much, much better and you get to eat the food afterwards! This time we had the tomatoes and lardo on toast (divine, even though we were told the Chef wasn't entirely happy with the quality of the produce); half a WA marron with a beurre blanc sauce (drool worthy, cooked absolutely perfectly), the suckling pig (my least favourite dish, only because it tasted underseasoned, perhaps because I am more used to Balinese style) and the artery hardening bone marrow in a brioche roll. Closely followed by the house salad to undo some of the damage!The dessert - mint and chocolate, deconstructed, as you do - was nice but didn't match the 'wow' factor of the rest of the food. But I guess that's to be expected and really, I didn't need it anyway...I think that the best way to enjoy Burnt Ends is to book an early table (6/6.30pm) so you don't have the stress of queuing/waiting for a table and I love watching as the chefs slowly build up momentum as the orders pile up, but with no stress just precision and focus. We have, of course, booked for our next visit to Singapore in December

Was love at first sight. Great ambience, Great staff and most importantly great ingredients amazingly cooked.
Will keep going back
5
My Mum and I had the pleasure to dine at this fabulous establishment on a Wednesday evening not long ago. Burnt Ends is understated class from the moment you enter, you just know your in for a treat. A dozen oysters perfectly shucked and a glass of champagne started the night. The staff,the music,the food,the wine and the company made this a night to remember. Not to mention watching the food being prepared right in front of us and seing the love and creativity of the team at Burnt Ends relish in. Book in soon, highlight of 2015 
5
Met my grind there, had no reservations but they managed to Accommodate us regardless of the place was fully booked, we had the tasting menu 130 ++ the sommelier recommended an accurate Merlot to go with, every dish was so simple and unpretentious,but full of flavor, I really enjoyed, will definitely recommend it and come back
5
This is an incredible restaurant and loved our evening here. My girlfriends and i tried a variety of dishes on the menu and they were all executed well. Highly recommend if you are a meat lover. The bone marrow was lovely but everything was excellent so hard to choose a stand out dish. Alsready booked our second visit ! High standard of service too
5
As a keen foodie, specifically searching for a great steak in Singapore, Burnt Ends has been the only consistently brilliant experience to date.The team are fantastic and have a true passion for creating incredible flavour combinations from the simple butter lettuce to the Burnt Ends sanga that honestly tops the best of the pulled pork burgers from Texas.Be prepared to go back on multiple occasions to have the opportunity to taste everything on that menu

This is a very popular place and booking is not accepted, unless it is an hour before normal meal time (11.30am and 6.30pm). The resturant is small and most of the seats are around the counter in front of the open kitchen and some bar stools facing the wall. The cook in front of us seem unsure of the operation, watching him made me nervous. Dishes were generally bland but fresh, with minimum seasoning. A head of small size grilled Fennel is S$16++, Sucking Pig $65++ but the roasted skin was not crispy, a bit too fatty and flat, grilled pigeon $90++ was completely under cook with blood oozed on the plate, the meat was bright raw red, an OMG shocking experience for us, avoid it unless you are Dracula! Their dessert (around $12++ )portion was very small and corkage is $50++ I am still wondering why I was not impressed with this place while the resturant is always full and so talk about
4
So, I'd like to say it was the best burger of my life, but is it a burger if it's made of pulled pork with jalapeño aioli and crunchy cabbage on a black sesame seed bun?Hole in the wall place, be prepared to sit where you can. Nice wine list. Cool atmosphere, happy crowd, ...Singapore is overflowing with good hole-in-the-wall restaurants. This one stands out.Check it out
5
This is a fantastic restaurant with the sort of food you want to eat everyday. The beef marmalade and the pulled pork sandwich are regularly mentioned but there are so many dishes worthy of praise, from the smaller dishes at the top of the menu, to the steaks, the pigeon and the suckling pig. It's muscular food with a delicate touch and some of it is very clever indeed. The wine list is an education in Australian wine, with varietals and blends that rarely make it out of Australia (or even out of their own state). Getting a table is can be less than straightforward but once you are at your seats it can feel like you have stumbled into a house party with amazing food - and with welcoming hosts who are having as much fun as you are
5
My colleague chose this restaurant weeks before our visit to Singapore and I did no research into it. I was pleasantly surprised.Almost all the seating is at the long bar in front of the kitchen, which is great and I think works well for a group of two since you can still talk to each other easily.The burger is a signature dish and it was amazing. The beef marmalade was also amazing and worth checking out.The drinks guy was knowledgeable about the many beers and recommended some interesting brews.Being Australian, it was a bit weird eating at an Australian restaurant in Singapore, usually I would want something less like home, however this is more a top shelf restaurant which is owned by an Australian rather than some place trading on being Australian.Recommended. I would go back
4
Quite small restaurant where you wouldn't go without knowing it's reputation. Great and tasty food targeted to younger generation. Opened in 2013 it sprang up right away to the top 30 restaurants in whole Asia. The food is innovative and the menu changes regularly. Discussions with the staff is easy-going. If you need some privacy there's just one table in the back, otherwise you'll sit by the long desk and look how your portions are made up. Wine list is long, mainly australian wines. Pilsner Urquell to mentioned from the beer list. Loud rock music. Put long sleeves on, the air conditioner are blowing right to your shoulders. Plan your booking at least 2-3 weeks ahead.
5
Beef Marmalade may sound strange, but it was last meal worthy... Also the leeks, and the seasonal fig dish they currently have on the menu. I would eat here every week if I could figure out how to get a reservation ;) Well done guys.
5
Quite a meaty place. Huge steaks on open fired grills.
Loved the "tapas" type menu we tried. So many fabulous dishes.
Try the "Sanger"!
4
So exciting to sit at the counter and watch chefs creating dishes. Foods are very good though a bit pricy. Highly recommended for those who loves to eat out.

Burnt Ends is all about the food, and that’s what this piece is about. And the service was excellent and the counter seating was fine for two. A party larger than four might find the place less convivial unless one books the one real table (6 – 10 pax) which comes with a fixed menu. This lunch was excellent value for money – an outstanding meal for about $50 a head.The Sourdough was served with two accompaniments; olive oil, and butter blended with mayonnaise and beef fat. The bread was excellent; on par with that at good bakeries in Singapore. The olive oil and butter-based spread were superlative, though the olive oil was probably slightly ahead.Kingfish, Green Mango and Peperomia was an outstanding starter. The kingfish was perfectly complemented by the cherry vinaigrette and lime dressing. Peperomia (a local herb) had an interesting flavour that was faintly mustardy and also went well with the green mango and the other ingredients. On our first visit this was an intensely flavourful way to start our meal, and in hindsight the best dish of the meal.Garlic Shoots and Gremolata was the next dish to reach our table. While the garlic shoots and aioli were the most prominent feature on the dish, the star of the show was the gremolata bathing the garlic shoots. The combination of lemon zest, lime, olive oil, chilli flakes, pepper and sea salt was almost overwhelming. Just a touch salty by itself, but perfect with the slightly burnt flavour of the garlic shoots.Leek, Hazelnut and Brown Butter was next and had a mixed reception at our table. One of us absolutely loved it, while the other thought there could have been more olive oil and less burnt butter – the latter dulling the flavour of the leek a wee bit. There is much to say that is good about this dish, too. The crushed capers adding a touch of piquancy and the burnt butter an exotic feel to what could have been a bland dish. Fennel Orange and Burrata came a close second to the kingfish. The dish looked impossibly large but disappeared quickly. The fennel was light and tasty, its flavour raised to an exciting level by the orange sauce and burrata.The Bone Marrow Bun also had mixed reviews at our table. One of us felt the brioche had been murdered when combined with the marrow and baked, while the other liked the blend of brioche, bone marrow, sautéed onions and sesame. However, the bun did show that Burnt Ends is best with meat and veg.There was definitely no room for dessert, but we will be back soon – very soon …(visited 8th Oct 2015

Recommended to this place by a business friend, he highly raved about it being the worlds top 50 restaurants . Awesome indeed! we were shocked when told there was only one lunch dessert , but that one dessert was excellent! we packed 3 more back home and visited back twice just for the tarts. The beef was very pricey but very delicious, we also had 2 pulled pork burgers ,fresh oysters and quail eggs. Service was great, love the whole set up and sitting area
4
Not worth queuing to dine here. I will only come if I do not need to queue and if I am given a seat where the action is. Not if I have to sit facing the wall and still pay a fortune to eat here. Just need to make a reservation early. Service was very good. Except the chef did not interact much with the patron.We had:-The leg of suckling a pig with cider which was quite good, Leek, Hazelnut and brown butter was just ok (found it too oily),Toast, Tomatoes and Coppa tasted like something you can have for breakfast,Grilled Lobster Thermidor?? which was fresh and quite good,Simply Grilled Aged beef was done well.Didn't order dessert, didn't seemed exciting and limited.Ordered a simple white wine but brought our own red. If you are into wine, suggest you bring your own and pay the corkage fee.Damaged was S$550
5
Super busy, very popular, hip place where you really have to either know someone or be there right at 6:00pm (even on a weeknight), to get a table. Excellent menu with superb meat range (perfected via their unique cook-up arrangement).Hipster chefs run the narrow cooking passage and guests sit bar-style, entertained by what's going on 2 ft in front of them. Very attentive service despite it being a hectic atmosphere. Enjoyed ourselves immensely - the food lived up to expectations and who would have thought a gem like this could be in Chinatown. Full of surprises

I love food and am frequently in a search for good food wherever I live or visit. My friends have gone “ooh’s and aah’s” about how great Burnt Ends is. I had read all the reviews (the good, the in-between and the bad). Still I have to judge it for myself. I am aware of the awards they have received. I’ve pop in a couple of times but was told I had this crazy waiting time so I’ve decided to eat elsewhere. Anyway, my husband knowing how much I love food and always wanting to take me somewhere different, he selected Burnt Ends for our anniversary dinner. He tried to book a week earlier but was told 1. Reservation is taken for timings of 6.00pm to 7.00pm. After that it’s walk ins. That’s fine as the time suited us but they apologise to say all the seats were already taken, we’d have to go between 6.00pm and 7.00pm to put our names down to be ensured we could get in for that night. That we did, we arrived between before 6.45 pm. Whoa! the place was packed. (I was thinking…wow food must be fabulous!) We were told that if we agree to perch on stools with a long narrow “table” mounted to the wall (so we face the wall), we’d probably get a table about 8.30pm or 9.30pm. If we wanted to sit on the low counter table with more comfortable chairs and we get a view of the cooking action, we’ll be looking at getting a table from around 9.45pm to even possibly 10.30pm. So we said, “ok we’re fine with the wall facing stools”.Then off we went to kill time at some bars. Phone rang at 7.30 pm to say we have got our table. They only hold the seats for 15 minutes. We were the first two on this counter table facing the wall and later several other people joined us on this table and by 8.00 pm this counter table was full but I couldn’t help but noticed there were a lot of empty chairs (6 in a row and a few more the other end) on the more comfortable chairs by 8.00pm and they were empty till 8.30pm (so what is this about 15 minutes holding time). I sincerely believe they scare you with this waiting time so you agree to the crap seating and other people coming in later can have the nicer chairs. I have to say those seats were horrible, uncomfortable, totally unpleasant, worse than eating in a place like a food court. So all these super long waiting times are just a ploy to make them look super popular. All hype!Still food is my priority. It’s pricey, but we have paid a lot more in other establishments before on my occasions ( and have very seldom been disappointed). Food finally came and with the first mouthful, I was extremely disappointed. It was good but not great, nothing special or spectacular. And taking the price in consideration, you can get a lot better tasting food elsewhere. First course, second course, third course, fourth course. All disappointing – it was good but not great. Also had to wait a long time in between courses. Worse meal and restaurant for my anniversary celebrations. In comparison with all my other eating adventures, which is daily as I don’t cook and I tend to splurge on food 2 to 3 times a week. This restaurant won’t make it on my list of top 50% of restaurants I’ve been to. I tried to understand why my friends gave it such a glowing review, it is my opinion, if you came with a bunch of friends and came under the influence of alcoholic and possibly on company expenses, or someone’s paying for your meal, you might hallucinate that this place serves exquisite meals and value for your buck.Nope, never going back and definitely not recommending it to anyone. This is a very pretentious place

I have heard there is usually a big wait but we walked straight in (IT was a thursday night and the haze was extremely bad which might have something to do with it). Either way I wouldnt have minded waiting as we loved everything about this place. The kitchen is completely open and you can see and interact with the chefs, and watch them work. The food was incredible, the service was excellent, everything down to the music and the decor was very cool, it has a great atmosphere. You have to try the beef marmalade and the leeks. We had steak (definitely one of the best I've had) but will definitely be returning here to try the fish as I was watching the chefs skillfully prepare it and it looked incredible.
4
Tried so much food that I can't remember all of them but overall the food was really tasty. Sat at the counter for lunch and it was nice to see the chefs in action. The one thing I missed was that it would be great if the chefs showed a bit more enthusiasm when serving you the food as well as explaining a bit more on why they chose certain ingredients for that particular dish while presenting it. Like I mentioned before the food was in many ways fantastic and I left very satisfied but there was something missing and I can't put my finger on what it was exactly in order for me to give this great establishment full marks. Will definitely be back but I think I'll try dinner next time to see if there's a difference

Stayed in a hotel just around the corner so decided to try this place after reading TripAdvisor reviews.
It was mediocre at best. Over priced hyped up food and a stuck up service to match.
Won't be back .
5
I feel I'm in Barcelona or London at this moment. This dining really does fit in there, not chinatown.
If I have a chance to visit Singapore again, I'll stop by there and try to taste all menu.
5
Very impressed by the food, do not miss the smoked Quail Egg and roll cube steak! I like the vibe in this place too! Service is very good! We had the $150 set menu at the chef table. It sits 6 comfortably, was glad we downsized our group from 8 as it will be too tight.The counter seats will only take booking for 6 & 6.30pm only. Rest of the time you have to walk in and be on the waitlist, was impressed when the manager told us they serve 120 pax per night and serve as late as 12.30am for the last seating. Love it, will definitely come back again
5
After reading about Burnt Ends in a article online I knew It was somewhere I had to Visit on my next trip to Singapore and it exceeded my expectations.The Food was amazing and the way the it is setup creates a really good atmosphere. My Partner was wrapped in it and put it in her top 10. I thought it was well priced considering other restaurants in Singapore and what you could pay there.I will be back for sur
5
Been here twice now for lunch and it has been excellent. With one drink it hit at 100 a head but then the food and selection of drink was amazing. Great place for a quick easy catch up. It's known for their meats but I found the vege and fish orders so balanced, tasty and comforting.
3
The food at this little rock up and dine restaurant is top notch. Unfortunately you pay through the nose for it. We stopped in for lunch and had a range of great dishes, including the Speciality Sanger, the Burnt Butter Leeks and a cracking piece of steak. Whilst the food was good,$225SGD for a 300gram steak is definitely over the top. If it was 1/3 cheaper, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. It's hard to justify the food at the price

What can I say what a great night, my hubby and I have just got back from Burnt ends for our anniversary meal.The food is delicious (please have the crackling and the leeks) the chefs interact with you and really make you feel welcome and our waiter, an Aussie guy really sorry didn't catch your name, was absolutely fantastic, attentive, funny and went the extra mile to make our anniversary a little bit special. Top restaurant, great staff and delicious food what more could you want

Small place with a long waiting list....no reservations accepted apart from 2 thirty minute bands during lunch and dinner. Got a takeaway whenever i visited....the pulled pork sandwich is extraordinary. Food on other peoples plates looked fantastic...there is a very convivial atmosphere....enjoyed being there even if i couldnt wait 3 hrs for a table

Burnt Ends is extremely popular and without reservations the waiting list can be extremely long.Located in a Chinese quarter of Singapore, well restored and full of small attractive establishments, the Burnt Ends is a small but vibrant restaurant with a single seating Bar and a fully open kitchen at close contact with the customers.Service is fast and accurate and the environment extremely lively and pleasant.The menu is intriguing, not very long but with interesting variety of ingredients (quail eggs with caviar, pigeon, wagyu beef) and a solid wine list of Australian wines (the place is run by an Aussie chef)The only reason I am not giving a higher rating is because at this price range (about 150 SGD x person) I would expect a higher level of execution.Everything was good (we enjoyed particularly a crayfish dish) but I would not say the meat was cooked at perfection (a bit chewy both the lamb and the beef dishes) and some sauces a bit overwhelming.Nothing that should deter from trying the place. It's definitely worth, and I believe the chef has more potential to express.Definitely a very original choice in the Singapore space

Amazing. Awesome. Great experience and one of the Best Dinner for us... Love the combination of ambience, food, friendly staff and interesting cocktails! Our fave is the Marron, Pigeon and Plum and Bone Marrow Bun! however, everything was just perfect! Dave Pynt and his team are great .... oh and the restaurant manager (Thomas Koh) is super nice and helpful ... Cannot wait to travel back to Singapore and have another Burnt Ends experience ..
5
I would recommend the Beef and Marmalade and pickles
Very tasty / trendy with good service ...but also expensive
4
The place to be. It's such a lively atmosphere, you quickly forget that your new best friend is actually a stranger you are now dinning with! Love it! Great cocktails and the food is superb!
5
Fantastic overall... Deserve at least 2 Michelin Stars or more...Great food with consistent quality.. Just as great as my previous visit. Staff are very knowledgeable and polite.. Great great place to eat... Not to mention.. A very handsome chef :)

Went for lunch, menu is nice and simple. Food was well cooked and presentation was pretty clean and simple. Cocktails were nice and make a lot of own syrups. Downside was limited wines by the glass.
5
divine food, setting, great staff - quite a different dining experience-in the kitchen-in the action - but what a delicious treat!
3
The food is innovative and very good. In fact, this is the Aussie version of FOC (Spanish restaurant on Hong Kong street), except that FOC provides a MUCH better overall experience (at only a slightly higher cost). Drinks are less creative than the food; we sat at the counter and were a bit horrified that the bartender used a dirty-looking plastic jigger to measure alcohol for a drink! It is less busy at lunch time, so go then when the staff is less hurried and more friendly (they don't levy a service charge, so be generous!
1
Told myself to never come back but had guests in town who were willing to brave it despite the reviews.Well - the staff remain as rude and unfriendly as ever and the food did not get any better, and everything is still expensive. The place is still packed. I just do not get it. Must be something about being "hip" which I do not understand.

We had been recommend to Burnt Ends by other Aussies. 20 minute walk from CBD Singapore. You go past some of the more interesting parts of the city.Small footprint, we arrived at 8:30 had to wait for a table for an hour, they take you number and ring when the seat at the bar is ready, lots of bars in the area to choose from while waiting.Arrived back at 9:45, place was jumping for a Tuesday night. You are seated with the kitchen and crew in front of you. This is a well oiled team. Chef took our order and made recommendations. The food is to die for. The steak cooked to perfections, if you want the rib give yourself and 1 1/2 hours. This place is a must visi

I had been hearing good things about Burnt Ends for some time but had never got around to eating there. We decided that we needed to just do it so this week we were there at last. We booked a seat but they only take booking up until 6:30pm and then it's first come basis, so you sit at the bar until a seat become available.This place is not just about the food, it is about the experience of being in a fine dining restaurant kitchen and having the food prepared as you watch and then the chef basically passed it over to you directly. We had the best seats in the house (just by chance) so we sat opposite the head chef - Dave and the sous chef Kierin so we could see them plate up all the meals that went out. The place is so organised and the staff are very busy but also have fun and interact with the customers. If you are in Singapore and haven't been - just do yourself a favour and get down there.One word of warning, you will probably not recognise many of the menu items (like a Sanga, Aussie term for a sandwich) - we took a stab at a couple and we all loved every course we had, including the sanga!
5
Before I start, remember reservation is a MUST for this restaurant. They only have 1 decent table and the rest are either counter or bar seats. My MUST try: Sanger, beef marmalade, quail eggs with caviar, leek, fennel, pork cracklings (got to preorder) and Crab (seasonal and requires preorder). I love the concept as u get to see how the chefs prepare your meal
5
Quality of the food is outstanding - prices are very very steep.
I guess you get what you pay for :)
Service was excellent.
5
This place is excellent bar the no booking policy, very london and very annoying especially as you can book if you go to the restaurant early! If you are going to have this policy then have a bigger venue with a bar! Your food and service will make people come back time and time again!We actually sat outside (first night they had seats) and had one of the best meals I've had in Singapore! The highlight being the pulled pork!Great service lovely staff and a seriously talented chef who's details I would love
5
We had to work hard to get a reservation here - four weeks out there was only one night left in the week we wanted. And reservations are only for 6pm or 630pm - after that it's walk in only. By 630pm the place was full and stayed that way. It is essentially a chef's table concept so if you are after a romantic evening, this is not the place! It is however, a great place to watch master chefs at work, with such harmony, calmness, precision and and attention to detail, it was a joy to observe.Everything that came out of those big ovens was an absolute delight and even revelation (e.g., the hanger steak). What I didn't like was a weird dish that was described as squid with feta and pepper sauce, which turned out to be a tiny puddle of roasted pepper sauce, with some finely shredded squid (also tiny) and no real taste of feta. At SGD 18 it was definitely an odd note and a let down.Also one of the waiters was a bit hesitant and seemed unsure of either the wine list or the menu (which almost resulted in us missing out on a glass of fine prosecco). As is usual with Singapore the wines are priced at 'ouch' level which means that most bills in places like this will be half wine/half food costs. We spent SGD 351 and overall consider it to be pretty good value but it would have been nice to have seen some more wines under SGD 100. Highly recommended

I heard many good things about Burnt Ends so I was looking forward to my first visit there. I've tried to make a booking for 7.30pm, but their policy is that you can only book for either 6pm or 6.30pm. After that, I was told, only "walk-in" is possible. Fair enough.I then arrived as a walk-in guest at about 8.45pm as I thought many of these "early guests" would have finished their dinners by that time. And true enough we got two seats. However, these seats were at a side table, facing a wall and there were much better seats kept empty at the main bar (=main seating area). I was very surprised to see this as I knew of their reservation policy and that they told me no reservation is possible if not for 6 or 6.30pm. So I've asked the staff why these seats are empty and I was told they are reserved for other guests!Hmmm...?! Not sure how good their reservation idea is; it seems to work out well for the restaurant but I feel a few guests might feel a bit 'tricked'. At least I did.Anyway, towards the end of the evening, the restaurant got a bit emptier and we could inherit better seats at the main bar and we finished our main course there.The food itself at Burnt Ends is really great and we've enjoyed it very much. The portions (especially the ones for the starters) are very small and you better order quite a number of them; e.g. the chicken wings (S$8.-) are actually just consisting of one chicken wing, served as two halves. Extremely delicious though, but still tiny.I may go back again sometime, but I'll surely try to get a reservation at 6.30pm

We had lunch at Burnt Ends on our final day in Singapore after it being recommended by the staff at Andre and Tippling Club. It was actually the chef from Tippling Club that made the booking for us.We were seated at the left end of the counter, right in front of the chefs. We asked Chef Dave what he'd recommend. He asked how hungry we were and said he'd put together a menu for us.Right from the start we were impressed by what we being prepared and presented. The food was outstanding and being able to watch up close and engage with the chefs was such a fun thing to do.I would absolutely return to Burnt Ends and would recommend it to anyone of my friends travelling to Singapore
5
Have eaten here a few times now. Love that it's completely open and everyone is facing the kitchen other than the one table for a group at the back. Friendly staff. Fabulous meat. Good red wine to accompany it too. Always costs a fortune to eat there but leave happy and satisfied every time
3
It is always a shame when a good restaurant becomes a victim of it's own success. They are too scared to say no to customers - my advice is if there is no room at the main table facing the kitchen, LEAVE...quickly...We ended up having good food, while balanced precariously on bar stools with a 30cm x 60cm wire mesh platform for food and drinks. The space was obviously designed to provide elbow room for 2-3 people to grab a beer while waiting - now they are trying to use it as dining space for 6 people. I ended up not ordering a bottle of wine, as it was obvious the dining experience was going to be cramped and uncomfortable - their loss.The food was mixed. A pulled pork roll was sublime: fantastic brioche bun, just the right balance of pork and coleslaw. The quail was forgettable. The suckling pig would have been great if it was served hot - I assume they had to wait for us to make "space" at our table.Good beer list - at least they have a small range of craft beers. Wine by the glass is OK - some of the wines on the wine list are ridiculously priced - but that appears to be a Singapore thing
5
Had a good and solid late night dining experience here. You are seated right in front of the grill and chefs and can follow the chefs preparing your meal. Nice and interesting day to day menu, with flavourful combinations well worth trying. Had duck hearts which was adorable and flank steak which was very nicely grilled! Great gastronomic treat worth a try
5
I have been lucky enough to go to this restaurant now 3 times. Twice for dinner and once for lunch. It always amazes me. Food, service, wine list is exceptional. Dave the Chef that runs the place runs a tight ship and provides an amazing experience for your mouth!! Definitely try his suckling pig and pulled pork sandwich. He has created a fantastic Aussie wine list as well. Service is efficient and friendly, can't wait to get back
3
This is an interesting casual grill restaurant where you sit at the bar watching the chefs. The food is OK, but the range of food is limited and the restaurant does not offer the depth of flavours you would expect from their high tech grills and ovens. As there are no tables and a limited ability to book, the restaurant is suitable for a casual meal only. They had a very nice home made tart for dessert when we visited but the place was not sufficiently memorable to revisit
4
Some dishes are a bit hit and miss but overall burnt ends is worth a visit. Not in a huge hurry but will probably go back at some point.
5
Food here is awesome. Don't worry about "no reservations" and just get here. Top spot in Singapore...and great combination of old style neighborhood meets modern restaurant...
5
Great restaurant with excellent food. The small portions make it great to share and especially the Burnt Ends Sanger was awesome! We really recommend that place!
5
It wasn't that hard to get a table as some says (we called them an hour before we got there). The whole concept is really amazing. One of the best bbq ever and it's definitely the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever tried. Loved the idea of the open kitchen and the hand crafted beer selection is more than amazing. In overall it's a real foodies experience. Don't miss it if you are a gastro geek! Although, I would be more than surprised if Burnt Ends was among the best 50 in ASIA..
5
Had a great dining experience at Burnt Ends last night. Brilliant food, atmosphere & service. Couldn't fault a thing. We had Beef marmalade & pickles; Kingfish, mango & pepperomia; Fennel, orange & burrata; Toast, tomatoes & pancetta followed by Rhubarb, pistachio & yoghurt; and Burnt cream and great sourdough!!! The only difficulties are picking dishes and then deciding which was your favourite. For me it was the Fennel and the Rhubarb - for my daughter it was the Kingfish and the Beef marmalade. That doesn't mean to say that the other dishes were lacking.Will we be back - absolutely. Would have been back tonight if we weren't on a plane. Dave and his crew are a great example of a well run kitchen in action. Thanks for the experience - we will see you next time we are in Singapore
4
It's definitely an alternative cuisine. It's somewhere between Aussie bbq and Japanese grilled skewers with the addition of mixed sauces. The meat was fresh and excellently cooked just right. The three of us shared - oysters, quail eggs, chicken wings, beef marmalade (we thought this was the best dish), duck hearts, pulled pork Sanger (second best), suckling pig, steak, burnt cream as dessert. The portions are small and tapas-like for sharing but make sure when you order you specify pieces as some dish are fixed pieces per order and makes it hard to share for three persons. Watching the buzzing kitchen hard at work was interesting and at times military-like, these guys are serious. I couldn't help but notice that the lettuce was whole taken out of fridge and put directly on our plates and I wonder if any of the greens have been pre-washed? We had to make our reservations one month in advance to get weekend seats. Paid about SGD 150/head including drinks and tips. Overall it's still a good alternative choice but I didn't think it was Asia's Top 50 standard.
5
Visited burnt ends a couple of days ago, service great, very prompt with delivery of food and very good atmosphere, was recommend by a friend, food was amazing, I'd recommend the venison to try and the beef marmalade and pickle! I'd recommend burnt ends to anyone visiting Singapore!
5
We are in Singapore for a week every May and Burnt Ends is always first on the list for restaurants! A foodieâ€™s paradise, cocktails are incredible, service impeccable, ambience perfect and of course there is Dave Pynt, the chef, owner. Man, this guy can cook and what a wonderful host! We asked him to impress us with a menu, of the 17 courses, only 3 were the same as what we had last year and were very glad to have the 3 signature dishes. One of the best dining experiences of our lives, the food is gorgeous! Excellent wine list. See you next year...

Difficult to get a reservation here - especially since they have only two slots in the afternoon (12 and 12:30) and evening (6 and 6:30) - after that its open for walk-ins! We were lucky and managed to get an afternoon booking - Tip they rarely answer their phones, try to write to them instead!This is a restaurant that prides itself on the quality and preparation of its meats - which could mean a wait time of 45 mins for your steak to be done just right! Its all worth it - I had a pulled pork burger and the husband had a rump steak and both were outstanding. Its a small menu that apparently changes constantly so you might want to look it up on their website before deciding on the long wait for a slot - there are no individual tables, just one long communal counter facing the kitchen, and one narrow long bar and stool kind of seating on the opposite wall
5
Burnt Ends - what can I say about this other than - You must try it for yourself!!!!! It is difficult to get a seat but well worth trying!!! They do not take booking and there are generally queues pre-opening to add names to a wait-list. So get there early if you can!Having been there multiple times I can say for sure it never fails to satisfy! I could go into details of the most tender and succulent meat I have tasted like the cuts of beef on offer or the pork - or one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have tasted - but I won't....... that is something you should definitely discover for yourself.The setting is along a bar that over looks the BBQ/Kitchen area and if like me it fascinates you to watch chefs at work, this is the perfect setting. To watch them cook a steak and the method and work that goes into it is just amazing to watch - glass of red in hand of course! Or a choice of craft beers - whichever takes your fancy! If you are a carnivore then this is most definitely a must try in SIngapore!!

Thank you guys for a splendid dinner and date very accomodating and food was superb spot on
I highly recommend for a visit was a little cramp and busy but it's to be expected
4
Tried some funky things like duck heart (if you're feeling adventurous). The menu changes but it's good for gastronomical dishes.
5
Cool atmosphere. Busy and with lots of foodies to that enjoy the food and wine at burnt ends. The food was excellent, both innovative and interesting with great taste. The service was professional and approachable, leaving me with the best of impressions.
5
Went with a colleague who had tried unsuccessfully to get a table 3 times previously - we found out why ... wow, what a find. The best small plates menu I have eaten and every dish was impeccable. Wine selection and service are almost faultless as well.
5
Invited by friends and colleagues to this restaurant for the first time, luckily we managed to get a cancellation at the Chefs Table, the only table in fact! Food was excellent superb steaks but what really made this so good was the large variety of vegetarian friendly dishes. Our vegetarian friend was very surprised to be invited to a restaurant known for its grilled beef, but was amazed by the vegetarian dishes he was offered. Even the carnivores among us loved the vegetarian dishes, as for the steak, absolutely superb!Getting a reservation is not so easy, especially as seating is limited, but you really owe to yourself to persevere ignore the limited seating and keep trying.One of the best meals I have had in Singapore
5
We happened upon this restaurant while out for drinks nearby and are so happy we did... the food is simply amazing. We shared a variety of dishes between the four of us, the highlights being what I believe is called the Burnt Ends sandwich and the steak. All the seating except for one table is at a long table/bar facing (practically in!) the kitchen, so it's great fun to watch the cooks. They even patiently answered our many questions about the food, ingredients, etc. Note that they only serve Australian wine in keeping with the Australian theme. Great food, great service, and we'll be back here as soon as we can
5
The hubby and I finally see it over for lunch after hearing so much about it and we were delighted! We had the Leek in brown butter with Hazelnuts, a Sanger, Flank Steak to share and a plus pie for dessert. All in all came up to about SGD100, which we thought was extremely worthwhile given the quality of ingredients used and ambience. For more details and pictures :https://passmethebutter.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/burnt-ends-singapore/Safe to say I'm looking forward to our next trip

This is an odd restaurant review as I didn't actually manage to eat any food.We arrived at Burnt Ends at 5.30 as we realise that they take no booking and requested a table for 6 people. We were informed they were busy and that we probably wouldn't eat until 8.30-9.00 so we adjouned to the bar on the opposite side on the road for a drink. Over the next few hours it seemed odd that we saw a lot of comings and goings in the restaurant but just waiting patiently. By 8.30 we wondered what was going on and went to ask the staff to be informed that we hadnt been forgotten but it would be a good half an hour. We asked again at 9.00 and 9.30 to be given the same answer.Just after 10.00 we were told we could come in and eat some starters at a bar against the wall. Upon sitting down we were informed by some very rude waiters that we couldn't eat where we were sat as we were in the way, and had to stand up and move by the door.Eventually at 10.30 they managed to find us a seat...by which time my appetite had faded and I really wasn't comfortable considering the way we had been treated, so left.I'm sure the food is excellent and I know its very trendy for a place not to take reservations as it makes them look cool and popular. All I ask for is a bit of transparancy. The staff must have a fairly good idea how long people will stay and can be honest to those people waiting. It seems greedy to just keep people hanging to try and make more money.From am economic standpoint it is also naive as during the 30 minutes we were inside, most guest were drinking water and playing with their mobile phones, with no food in front of them...whereas I guarantee our group would have been very profitable clients. I would like to say I will give Burnt Ends a second try, but if I can expect to be treated the same way...then why should I

A friend recommended this restaurant. However, after I saw the many negative reviews (on hungrygowhere), I was almost scared to go. Especially because we were a bigger group with children.I have to note that we came for lunch. Not sure if the same applies for dinner.Let me start with the service. Unlike the claims of many people (on Hungrygowhere) I cannot confirm that the service was bad and/or rude. On the contrary we have been treated very friendly by attentive receptionists, waiters and barkeepers. They did give us recommendations and of course tried to upsell their menu. I have no problem with that. In the end we did decide to go with their beef flank although we were warned that it would take 1.5 hours. In the meantime we had cocktails (small and expensive) and several dishes including the fennel, the sour dough, zucchini and later the beef with the buttered lettuce and marrow buns. No complaints about the food whatsoever. The beef was very rare (we liked it this way), but they did offer to cook it longer. Only the fennel could have had a bit more taste, but it wasn’t a deal breaker. The only strange thing about Burnt Ends was the chef himself. We sat at the counter (it’s an open kitchen, which is great, cause you are so close to the action and it should also allow for good interaction between the staff and the customers, you should think). During the entire time we were at the restaurant (about 2.5 hours), he only came to us once when serving the beef steak. He did this by simply presenting the plate to us without saying a single word. So yes, if your customers are spending over 1000 SGD in your restaurant an effort to at least introduce the dish you are serving would have been in order. But besides this a good experience overall. The food is tasty, but Burnt Ends is nothing for a small wallet

This restuarant first made news earning a coveted spot on Asia's Top 50 restaurants from nowhere. And the fact that you had to book 2 wks in advance increased our curiosity about this restaurant. It is located in the hip and happening Keong Saik Road overspilling with boutique hotels and pubs. Upon entering, you are ushered onto counter seats which faces all the chefs and the grill. The music was loud but is is different. It is not fine dining. It is not Tony Romas. It is just refreshingly different. We were also shown the Chef's Table but believe me, the counter seats are where the chefs and the real action is, not the Chef's Table where the Chef hardly made any interaction. Here at the counter, we felt like we were at the centre of a teppanyaki masterchef. So much things were happening. So much exciting food and aromas were made before our very eyes that we ended up over-ordering what was being cooked and what looked good.We ordered almost most stuff on their menu.1) the smoked quail egg with caviar. Simple quail egg but one puff and it is all good. Forget the cholestrol for once.2) The squid grilled was like eating ramen except they were really well smoked chewy squid. Yummy.3) The sanger or pulled pork burger seemed to be everyone's favourite. The sauce was a tad too saltish but nevertheless very savoury. Soft and succulent pork in all its natural goodness...4) The suckling pig and cider...can you get more porky than this. But this version outdoes the many Spanish suckling pig in town. For once, the skin was really paper skin and gave Cantonese suckling pig a good run for its money.5) The Blackmore wagyu steak...slow cooked over firewood, dripping in its own fat and oil,,,and then sprinked with a generous dose of sea salt...this is as good as wagyu beef in its natural juices taste, smoky, soft, succulent, juicy....my advice, save your appetite for this champion...6) Grilled small potatoes in salt - nice7) House specialty of grilled leek with nuts and olive oil,,,for many who dread leeks like me, this is not leek as we know. This is leek that tastes of grilled asparagus in a buttery aka escargot sauce.. leeks dont taste like this!!!8) Crackling and mustard...actually the mustard was a bit of overkill,,,,we were happy to just eat the crackling on its own.Service was good. The Aussie chef was conversing with us the whole night and his aussie humour added to our dining experience. But for a place with only 24 seats and probably 20 staff, not surprised this place is booked for weeks in advance. Whilst we were there, everyone without a reservation even for 2 pax at 9pm were turned away. So my advice, make a reservation, dont try your luck.Food is good, prob deserve 4.5 stars but for the concept, a well deserved 5 stars. It is time we have sth new to eat than the Andre, the Les Amis, the a dime a plenty Spanish tapas and the overpriced but poorer renditions of Michellin-restuarants in MBS. For an island that prides itself on being living to eat rather than eat to live, we should have more enterprising concepts and Burnt Ends is a great start.And for those who complained it is expensive, our dinner for 4 came to almost $500, cheap for the kind of food and experience. This is prime wagyu beef done the slow cooked way. You just cant get it anywhere even in The Cut. And you will have to pay prob $500 a head to overstuff yourself with mediocre beef at the Cut

So happy to have a place like this in Singapore. A unique way to use charcoal and wood creating truly original flavours and textures!
4
Went early around 6pm, as I was flying back to London later that night. Just loved it. Great atmosphere, loved the idea of the small plate starters and the bbq steak was just perfect. A definite must.
5
After going once with my girlfriend we never looked back! Amazing place, delicious food and fantastic people working there. Book the chefs table for groups and chefs will put together a tasting menu for you. Easily the best way to sample the broad menu. Don't go without having a Sanger
3
Food overall is good but nothing to shout about. Feels that almost all the dishes I had that night was full of mayonnaise and cream. No doubt the steak I had was not too bad. Doneness and flavor of meat was great. Will I come back again? No, not for the food. Service - Great!
5
being voted # 30 of Asia's top 50 restaurants we decide to try this place as it looks very cool....and it was !!! the open kitchen, the staff, the chef, the cooking, the meat ( oh my good the meat !!!!) it was just perfect. We had such a great night and such a great food. Cannot wait to go back
5
Wanted to go for ages and finally got in last night (we went early)food was outstanding, we had quail eggs with caviar (warm with an intense velvety yolk), beef marmalade on toast, leeks (oh boyo, they were good) , a Sanger (pulled pork sandwich with a spicy kick) and roast suckling pig (a sharing dish cooked to perfection with crispy crackling) and finished with a mint ice cream (tasted like Walls Vienetta from days of yore, a good thing)Right, one annoyance is the no table booking process (except for the first 30 mins of service), making potential waits very long (first attempt to go to the restaurant we were told of a 3 hour line, gave up went elsewhere). strategy, go early
5
We went for lunch as it is always so difficult to get in to during the evening. Loved all the food that was served - really delicious and will definitely return. Unless you book their one shared table, all other seating is at the bar, so not very sociable if you have more than 3 people
5
The reviews on various sites were mixed but mostly excellent. Some people just like to moan.....Great food, great setting, superb ambience albeit a bit frantic at times. You get drawn into the kitchen dynamics and "heat". Would go again and even make it a regular, if I were not leaving Singapore soon. Vesper martini to start which was excellent. King Fish and mango was delightful and fresh, Beef Marmalade was stunning on sourdough but it was my sort of thing. cauliflower and Yoghurt Dukkah was also good and an excellent start to the meal. The Onglet was fantastic. Tender and tasty. The wines are all from small Aussie vineyards so bit of a chance but we chose very well. Yaringberg 2005 was excellent. Although it was expensive, but wine is in Singapore. Overall it was a great experience. Not for those on a budget but definitely one for the foodies that are not looking at the price of everything.....Quite amazingly it was also handling take-aways.....which for a good quality restaurant was...er..interesting. It is No 30 in the San Pellegrino top 50 in Asia..
5
Wonderfully rich and unique small plates. The potatoes with pollack cavier was fantastic! The roasted cauliflower was perfectly preparred. The beef marmalade was decadently wonderful to an extreme - the rich beef offset well by the thinly sliced pickles and toast. The pulled pork was by far the best i have had in Asia. Very porky and smoky - perfect with the chili heat and cheddar and slaw all stacked together on a brioche. mmm. My only regret is that this was lunch and i did not have time to enjoy this great meal with a good bottle of wine....next tim

As one reviewer has already said, ostentatious and overpriced. If you are going to charge as much as they are, then you better make sure:• Your service is good• Your food is outstandingUnfortunately as much as I wanted to like Burnt Ends, it really wasn’t that great, merely average and when you consider the price than it drops down to poor. I was there with two guests and we tried several dishes. They were all pretty forgettable (a peri peri duck heart rings a bell?), but the pulled pork sandwich was described by one of my guests as a “wet mess” whereas my comment was that it wasn’t even the best pulled pork sandwich I had eaten that week (Cedele at Tanjong Pagar for those interested).The service was as bad as everyone has made out, and it could be because we were in “the cheap seats” on the bench with our noses against the wall.I have no issues forking out crazy money for fine cuisine in Singapore, but when you can get better around the corner at Maxwell food court there has to be issues.I understand on the night we were there the Head Chef (Owner?) wasn’t in, so perhaps that was the reason it was all so Average.It was so average, that it has left me in the lurch for my anniversary dinner…I was planning on taking my wife there….now I have to find somewhere else
5
Had to go as heard good stuff about this place.
Food is fantastic and love the ambience. Will be back for more ..
5
Loving the leek and pork sanger, The sea bream was a delight which made the whole experience worthwhile and the chef was very attentive and making sure you had a good time. of course I will be visiting again very soon.

Burnt ends was recommended by a lot of online read up. So this was a must try. It definitely lived up to expectations. Meat was grilled to perfection. The sanger was very good too. A meat lover's heaven for sure.

Bustling dining experience with the chefs cooking right in front of you. If you're hungry, the small portions may burn a hole in your pocket when you're done!

Had a boys night out at Burnt ends. We took the chefs table with a fixed menu and minimum spend and were tested to an exquisite meal. It is such a competent kitchen I have no reservations saying its the best in Singapore. I'm not all that much into counter dining so lucky that we took the only table there. But I would return many times if only counter seats were available. Good service too!

Visited Burnt End with a friend. Nice cosy place and smoothing music playlist. Open kitchen concept, with this big oven and flames could be seen. Ordered a number of dishes like quail egg, leek and hazelnut, pull pork burger, flank steak and some side dishes. The food was pretty decent but it really need to be hotter. None of the dishes were hot, despite the burning hot oven is just in front of us. The pricing is average but reasonable for both food and drinks. Service quality not up to par, she need to smile and every time customers ask for something, please don't feel so irritated, you are not making any of us feel welcome. Will I go back again? Maybe not

I really liked it here. The dishes are very interesting with lots of unique dishes. The standouts for me was the smoked quail egg with caviar, bone marrow bread, and the charred leek with macadamia and truffle.There are great cocktails on offer also. The bar seating concept is great. You can see all the food being prepared by the chefs which is great.The prices are a bit on the high side, but I think it is worth it

Please don't come here unless you enjoy smoking 500 dollar bills. In all seriousness, I have been to high-end steakhouses and know that excellent food can come at (and deserve) a high price. But the prices at Burnt Ends are outlandish for what you get. I had the pulled pork burger, which was laughingly tiny, and can say that I have had way better and bigger burgers for a less than a fourth of the price. My friends' burrata and fennel dish could not feed a hamster. The steak the other guests ordered looked fantastic, but comes at 500$/kg, with no other cuts of beef available. Do your wallet a favor and try another place

I had dinner with my wife at Burnt Ends. As long as you don't go ordering S$250 bottles of wine the prices are not too crazy, that said it is not a reasonably priced restaurant but the dishes are worth it, well most of them are, not all.We were thankfully seated on the end of the bar like table otherwise you are in for long waits, which shows how popular this somewhat haute cuisine place is!Upon being seated we were given our menus which we found "interesting", thankfully the waitress was quickly on hand to explain everything in great detail and made some super recommendations.The food arrives quickly enough and it was a very pleasant meal. The wine was great but I did go over the top.They have some fantastic "homemade" style drinks on display and am looking forward to returning again to sample another new menu

We heard many mixed reviews on burnt ends and finally decided to give it a try. Booking a table was tough, took us more than 2weeks to get a table. But it's definitely worth the wait. Food was spectacular service was fast and attentive. If I have to choose, Pulled pork sandwich was simply mind blowing. Will definitely come by soon!

Sublime superb one of the best European dining experiences in South East Asia.
Our fourth visit never disappointed
It's about the love of food not prevention
Unique wine offering and amazing cocktails
Must go!

Found it very difficult to get into this place but we were glad we perservered.Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere.I have read some of the reviews regards the pricing but did not think it was over the top especially when compared to similar type establishments.The food was spot on, great flavours, really fresh and served to us at the bar by Chef/owner David Pynt with some explanation of each plate.Could not fault the food. Toast tomatoes and basilHot roasted quailFennel orange and burrata Rump capLamb and yoghurtPineapple rum and vanilla for dessertCouple of caterpillar beers and gin and tonics.The only critisism would be the barman who didn't speak a word to us or acknowledge our presence even though we were seated in front of where he was mixingWould definitely return for the foo

Overpriced. Apparently Australian cuisine. I am Australian and I have never seen a steak for $490 per kg. Burnt Ends is a nonsense with an arrogance that does it no favours. We ended up asking for the check after a couple of ordinary tapas style starters (at $30 a piece) and headed across the road for a $20 burger at potato head. Expect Aussie wine at 300% markup. Luke's chophouse is better value for money if you are looking for a a great steak. Not cheap but truly excellent

Place tries to make it very difficult to get a table which gives it a very cool and hip place. But it is all a trick - in my opinion.Totally pretentious from the moment you get in. Food was average and outrageously overpriced. The recommendation was a 450 bucks per kg ribs/beef. Seriously. Service was non existent. Everyone looking really cool without a smile. Anyway, probably the most overrated restaurant I have ever been to

We hijacked the incredibly knowledgeable and passionate Chef Jeff inadvertently upon taking our seats at the bar!Loved seating at the bar as the chefs wove their magic.Jeff is charming and charismatic and the cuisine team run like a well oiled machine.Loved the simple paired down menu with lots of surprises aNd twists.A couple of so so dishes dropped the rating but Jeff made the place five stars!Good wine choices too!Also loves the aroma of the wood burners and excellent execution of the techniques!

Was recommended this place and was eagerly looking forward to it. Food was good to very good but the chef/owner was away in Paris and it showed in all aspects. Customer service could be much better. Looking forward to coming back when all hands on deck.

I have been trying to get reservations at this very small, yet very popular restaurant. I finally managed to get two seats and it was so worth the wait. The layout of the restaurant is unique, you actually sit right at the kitchen so you can see the staff and the chef in action. They also have a fabulous selection of cocktails. Not your ordinary ones, but probably about 10 barrel kept, prepared concoctions that are just to die for. Try the Happy Endings

Rarely do I make an effort to review a restaurant on tripadvisor, but this place has compelled me. What can one say? Nice decor, decent ambience, good concept, relatively knowledgeable staff, BUT...Fatally flawed menu. Arrogantly light on detail/explanation of the dishes. First experience is that everything is handsomely highly priced yet arrives as barely a mouthful. The menu descriptions are cryptic and exciting, but what arrives is at best a spoonful of over seasoned veggies with a few experimental dressings. Portion size is so small in some cases it can't even be shared - see king fish and green mango (3 2mm thick slices of sashimi with green mango and what tastes like japanese shop-bought dressing). The style of the food is astonishingly incongruous with the pricing model. You're essentially getting rehashed BBQ trimmings and salads in tiny portions that are well presented, but fail to scintillate the taste buds. The cost of the steak is quite literally unreal. I went for a few hundred grams of their wagyu costing 225 SGD. It took an unjustifiably long time to cook (1 hour +). On no grounds did the wait warrant the result. They also initially tried to fob me off with a big lump of fat. I politely protested and was patronisingly told that wagyu is fatty. No **** sherlock!The last, and most annoying aspect is the poor quality and yet woefully over priced wine list. You are held hostage to a selection of mediocre Australian wine. Sorry, but for a restaurant in this price bracket, people expect choice and variety. The cocktails were very good no less, but I wouldn't give this place a second look

With my visiting in-laws in tow, we were determined to have dinner at Burnt Ends. It was 8 pm and we expected to wait at least an hour.We waited 10 mins!! 4 people didn't show up. Gold!!We had smoked quail eggs, kingfish with mango, fennel with goats cheese, Alaskan crab, pulled pork sanger, beef with mustard, corn cheese roja, tomato bruschetta, and rump with bone marrow.Every dish tasted so good. My favourite....corn with Gruyere cheese. It was perfect! So we had another one. Another favorite was the rump steak with bone marrow; moorish and perfectly cooked. Orange marshmallow had a hit of flavor and the chocolate with sea salt was simply a perfect way to finish a stunning meal.We had a nice chat with Jeff the Chef from Vancouver. The kitchen staff were relaxed and friendly. I liked that the food was not overworked but simply cooked in fire and perfectly enhanced with seasoning, oil and/or butter.We'll be back for more

No! No, no, no, no no!So, if you are a foodie, you gotta try new places to check them out. And you inevitably are going to get some regrets. This is a place like that. i wish I hadn't gone. And its my duty to pass on the info to other foodies.Okay, lets start with the good points. Or maybe just one point. It's buzzing. We had to wait over an hour and a half to get seated. But buzzing is pretty much the start and end of it. But "style over substance" is what comes to mind.So what about the food? Very disappointing. Hence the title of this review.But you need to believe me, so you need to read the details. I took comprehensive notes so here we go with that.I picked the cheapest red wine on the list. $80. It was thin and acidic. For $80 I expect a better wine that that. Minus one.The menu is unintelligible. I know what "Jacobs Ladder" is in the normal context, but not on a menu. Maybe they think its cool to have an unintelligible menu, but I think its just bad marketing.But having learned from the staff that it is steak, we ordered one. Oh, maybe I should say this here. The waiting staff are pretty damned good. Trained to be there but yet invisible. Full marks for them, they live up to the prices. Well trained. But back to the steak. Nicely cooked, but the steak quality left something to be desired. And the sauce..... if I am not wrong, it was Meaux mustard blended with mayo. Too basic and too oily for these prices. Next dish. Leak with hazelnuts and white truffle. A leak for $42, so we are expecting a lot. alas not delivered. Okay, the leak was nicely cooked but it tasted of burnt butter... could not taste any white truffle. Maybe they had run out? But if I pay $42 for a leak, I expect it to have white shuffle shavings. Alas it did not.Next up: beef brisket with Russian sauce and sauerkraut. The best cooked dish of the evening,. Nice and peppery, tho the Russian sauce was too heavy on the vinegar. But at least they can cook something vaguely right.Dessert: banana and dulce con leche. Owwww... seriously way, way way off target. Dry on the outside, bitter, and salty. Nowhere near what it should taste like. Hideous. Bottom line. If you are a rich and tasteless banker who likes a buzz, go here. If you are expecting good food to match the price, steer well clear (and take a tip from me, go to one or other of Joel Robuchon's places on Sentosa...depending on your budget.... whichever you pick will be ten times better. I give you my word!). Style over substance, and so poor value for money

The food is tasty and a bit different. The atmosphere is buzzy and busy. It's bar food and not that comfortable but it's all about the food and it's fun.
5
This place is great from food to service all the time... Have never been disapointed going there... great ambiance and nice people around.. Must try if you have not.

I am in awe for the job done by this Australian chef. As the name says, the menu takes inspiration from burning, grilling, and smoking food... meat is grilled to perfection, its colour charms the eye and the taste buds. But there is more to that. Everything is cozy, and it tastes like home. We had burrata (great! And I am Italian, I don't always say "great" about burrata), pulled pork sandwich to die for, fennel salad (so long no see...). And then THE steak. Everything is recommended...except the burnt marshmallow..

My family of 4 adults was recently in Singapore for a 4 day stopover and we had heard about Burnt Ends...and we're glad we did! It wasn't easy to get a seat as they are limited however there are a number of great bars nearby to build the appetite.They phoned us and advised our seating was ready and the experience began. You are able to sit on a long counter table which is not too conducive to chatting with a large group however it does give you the opportunity to observe the chefs and cooks at work...simply sensational experience. Nothing is hidden, personalities are on show, training is evident and all under the watchful eye of Masterchef and owner David (did the beard come off?).The food was awesome...tasty, in abundance and a wide range of choices. The wine list, although a little pricey was good and the staff were pleasant and accommodating.If you're in Singapore don't miss the opportunity to experience Burnt Ends...a trendy little newcomer to the scene and one which should please most palates and pockets

This was my second visit at Burnt Ends and I was very pleased again.Once you get a seat - and trust me - its not easy ( I tired 3 times between both visits to get a seat...), you can be sure that your evening will be great.The food menu has great choices and if you are hungry and adventurous you can try plenty of interesting things like Sea Urchin, Grilled Scallop with XO sauce, Zucchini flower gratinated with Taleggio cheese, beef, lamb... Ill suggest to take your time and try little by little and not to over eat at the beginning, cause you would miss many nice things.Besides that the service is great and you also get to talk to the chefs, hence the long bar seats are just in front of the kitchen. Its fun to see how your food is being prepared on the hot and smoky gill!The only thing that I personally didnt appreciate that much is, that the wine list is purely Australian...I mean there are some great OZ wines, but for my feeling & taste to overpriced. However, I have chosen a mid range wine , which suited our food choice.I actually wanted to bring my own French Wine, but when I jumped into the taxi, I realized that I forgot the wine at home...All in all a great night out with my hubby - we enjoyed and will come back for sure
5
Came across this place by accident and have been back several times for a long lunch! Excellent advice by the staff for food choice and wines. Menu changes daily depending on what's available so they are sticklers for high quality produce! No negative comments ....a must try if passing through Singapore
5
Loved this place. Great vibe. Chefs obviously very passionate - designed the whole incredible wood-fired oven themselves, & the wood-burning grill plates.The menu looks deceptively simple. Cracking start (excuse the pun) with smoked quail egg & caviar. One gorgeous mouthful of utter deliciousness. Followed by 'scallop, salmon & creme fraiche' which turns out to be an ingenious scallop chip, smothered in creme fraiche & topped with salty, bursting fat salmon roe. Addictive.Q, the manager, is personable & lovely.Back to the food - oh just go, it's so good. Open kitchen for fun ogling at everything going on in the kitchen, which is smoothly orchestrated. There's passion & technique & inventiveness on every plate.Seating - mostly counter seating (but comfortable chairs) or some teensy perching on a high stool at a little mesh ledge - not comfy but so worth it for the food.Loved it
5
The menu offer such great choices, lay off food for the day so you can indulge in what is on offer. I see some reviews complaining re service, do not understand, the service for me was friendly and professional. The chef was engaging and clearly cares about the quality of his produce and what is served. The smoked quail's eggs are a great taste and the crackling with mustard is a treat. Very enjoyable

I really wanted to like Burnt Ends. I had heard about this amazing restaurant with a super talented chef serving some of the best food in Singapore. I'd read all the reviews, I had seen all the awards, I had quickly glanced over the negative comments about customer service on TripAdvisor. So here I arranged to meet two of my dearest friends for what promised to be a memorable meal. One of our party of four was rather heavily pregnant but she assured us that she was fine with the food and really looking forward to the experience.I had checked the website and had found that as is quite normal these days with popular/trendy restaurants there was no pre-booking allowed. As a consequence my wife arrived early at the restaurant at 6.30pm in a queue which was already forming totry and arrange a table from 7pm onwards for our group. She was told that it would be a 2-2.5 hour wait and if she could provide her mobile number she would be called back when the table was ready. On this advice we adjourned to a bar in the nearby vicinity until the designated time.After meeting with our friends in a nearby bar we waited for a call from Burnt Ends. Without any call by 8.10pm we decided to call the restaurant ourselves and were told that we might now need to wait until 9.30pm. We all understood that it was difficult to get into popular restaurants so we decided to hold out.At 9.30pm we still had not received any contact from the restaurant so we decided to go directly there to establish what was the situation. Upon arriving we were greeted with a rather unhelpful member of service who then told us that we may have another hour's wait. At this point we became quite frustrated and asked why we no one had contacted the number we had given to them about the delay. At this point the chef, David Pynt came out to talk to us.I was hoping for a reasonable conversation with the chef but after a few minutes he stated that he did not believe my wife and her account of booking a reservation. When I asked if whether that meant he thought she was not telling the truth he then said, "I can say what the $$$$ I want'.... Wow! In my 25 years of restaurant visiting I have never experienced such a rude chef. I am sorry but no matter how talented a check you might be you don't talk to customers like that. At this point I really did not want to be in this place any more and we left.So unfortunately we never got to taste the food at Burnt Ends and neither do we want to anymore. I tried to post a comment to the Burnt Ends Facebook page bit can see they don't allow public posts without moderation which only makes me think that there may be many others who have similarly bad experiences which they are afraid of being let out. But actually if you look through the TripAdvisor reviews (which are not moderated by the restaurant) you will see that we are not alone...So, moral of the story is, if you want to be kept waiting for a table for a whole evening and then be treated incredibly rudely by the chef head over to Burnt Ends. They can satisfy this request like no other

Was planning for some time to go to Burnt Ends and give it a try as had some mixed reviews but being a meat lover wanted to go see it myself. Tried calling the whole morning to try place a reservation and no one answered the phone. Had a meeting around the area so ran the risk of going there anyway. I arrive and place was busy. An expat guy which i assume was the maitre d. comes to me so i ask if they would have place for 2. He says : 'cant you see we are full' ? in a very ironic way. I said i tried calling all morning but never got answered and again in an ironic and rude way the guy said : why answer the phone if we are full anyway ?................seriously what a disrespectful person he is and even worse how come the owners seem not to care as i see other reviews telling about same experience. Bad experience and rude service will sure make me never consider giving it a try. Shame on them .......they are full...for now...but as all restaurants they one day will beg for people to go eat there as competition in town is brutal and bad service is a NO-NO..

On my third night in Singapore after relocating, a friend took me to Burnt Ends to "eat meat". Apparently getting a seat at the restaurant is not easy, as they only have one table for 8-10 people that can be reserved. The rest of the restaurant seating is along a bar that runs parallel to the food preparation and grill area. As a result, I think this is a place best experienced as a couple or in a small group (max 4) setting.For being effectively a BBQ joint, the decor is very nice and tasteful. There weren't any gimmicks here, just an industrial feel with wood tables and modern (very comfortable) chairs.Normally I don't comment on the smell of a restaurant, however given the prominence the grill has in the body of the restaurant, one immediately smells the burning wood. It definitely adds to the overall ambiance of the place.So the food: we split a number of starters including smoked quail eggs and some others that I've forgotten. The flavours were well thought out, balanced and generally fantastic.For our main(s) we started with a pulled pork sandwich on a brioche bun. What can I say other than: Oh. My. God. Without any irony, this was probably the best sandwich I've ever had. Certainly Top 3. The pork was perfectly cooked: soft, moist, and bursting with flavour. Adding to this was a bit of red cabbage to give it a nice crunch and a sauce (maybe a chili aioli...not really sure) that rounded out the amazing taste. Seriously, I cannot stress how good this sandwich was.My group shared a second main, grilled flank steak with bone marrow. Typically I would steer clear of flank, but given the preparation style it turned out perfectly and wasn't at all chewy. The marrow was soft and melted in your mouth like butter. Also a highly recommended dish (but not even close to the pulled pork).We shared a bottle of wine (2006 Massena Barbera), which at SG$ 120 wasn't the most expensive option by far, but was extremely nice. There were a lot of more expensive options (circa SG$200), but honestly this bottle was more than good for the food. Also worth noting, was the fact that all the red wine on the menu were from Australia.Service was friendly, food prep wasn't super fast, but they kept our wine glasses filled.In summary, I will DEFINTELY return to Burnt Ends. The food was stellar and the dining experience was very memorable. Highly recommended

Sitting along the bench overlooking the food preparation, you do get to see what's going on and what everyone else is having, but it's hard to have more than one or two friends in conversation. Great service, better food, it was worth the wait to get a seat at this popular restaurant. The pulled pork Sanger was my favourite dish for the evening, the roast chicken was succulent and the suckling pig crispy on the outside and falling apart inside.
5
Such a special experience at this extraordinary restaurant. Burnt Edges lived up to everything I had heard about it and more. The interaction with the restauranteur, his staff and clientele was like a conductor leading his orchestra. The food was stunning and this will be a night I will remember for a long time to come
2
A rather new hipster restaurant where concept and decoration are seemingly fantastic, the food is nice but the staff is really not enjoying what they're doing or simply don't know how to do it.While the food was tasty, especially the pulled pork, the service was extremely slow and poor.We didn't feel welcome at all, had to waive down a waiter numerous times. Snappy answers when we asked about several dishes on the menu. Not ones did somebody ask if the food was okay. The bartender was simply arrogant. Not a smile, not a thank you, not a goodbye. Come on, when you spent your cash fast in a place like this, at least let the staff give you some sort of feeling that they appreciated your visit. Service remember? The waiter tapped me on the shoulder when I was in a conversation because he wanted me to sign the receipt. What happened to "excuse me"?We've just settled down in SG and we're enjoying the friendliness and warmth we've gotten in many restaurants. This was a BIG turn off when it comes to a professional and friendly staff. To my opinion the staff make or brake a place. So lighten up guys! A smile is easy
5
Absolutely fantastic. Had a son and father lunch after a quick meeting. Never been before. Was immediately impressed by the waiting staff and by a bearded person in the most impressive apron I have seen this side of a bikers gathering. We ordered the sea urchin, quail egg caviar, Jacob's ladder, some sort of steak tartare (adopted from a Spanish marinated/ cured pork recipe) bone marrow bun, tomato and lardon toast and pulled pork sangers. Yes the last word gave it away. The chef is an Aussie. The food was absolutely superb. All of it! The chef does not skimp on the the little things. He butters or oils the bread. He puts on the correct amount of cheese. He takes his time. Looked through the drinks list - cannot wait to come back in the evening with a few mates to tackle the bar as well. Well, well worth it - even if it was pricey. Quality is never cheap. Keep it up.

After having passed this place and read about it multiple times in a variety of publications, I finally walked in today off the street for an early dinner to give it a try and I was not disappointed. I was there for the Pulled Pork Sandwich (I believe they call it "Sanger" on the menu) which I had kept reading about but decided to give a few other dishes a try as well. The first thing you notice when you enter is the smell of fire; not a bad smell, but the smell reminiscent of campfires if you are accustomed to those. It actually adds to the mood and the charm of the place and by no means puts a damper on the experience. After all, you are at a restaurant called "Burnt Ends", burning wood is kind of in the ethos of the place.The interior of the restaurant is quite nice. Chairs line a long dining bar facing the ovens, grill and open kitchen. There is also some high counter space along the wall which is where I was seated since they were fully booked for the evening. The decor of the restaurant matches the mood of the place quite well. Now to the food: The sandwich was mind blowing. You'll see by my other reviews I am a fussy eater but this is by far and away one of THE BEST sandwiches I have ever had in my life, definitely earning a place on my "Top Ten Awesome Eats Wedged Between Bread" list (that for the moment exists purely in my head!). The pulled pork was lovingly cooked, perfectly moist and tender. The cabbage added a wonderful crunch, the aioli added flavor...and that brioche bun was perfectly moist and dense! I inhaled the thing. By far and away the star of the show. I also had Burrata with roasted Fennel and Orange oil that was good; a nice mellow flavor to lighten up the palate after that sweet porky goodness. The roasted fennel was great, but could have used a touch more seasoning when roasted but other than that it was a good mellow tone to take for course #2. The plum and Blueberry Tart was great to round out the impromptu dinner. The tart crust was buttery and dense, the blueberry and plum balanced things nicely, and the homemade whipped cream (vanilla bean perhaps? couldn't tell) added a smooth, silky flavor. I added in a toasted marshmallow just for the hell of it at the end as a palate cleanser (after all, we are at Burnt Ends so a toasted marshmallow makes sense!). It was a great meal. But the ting that really impressed me was the price. For all three dishes plus the marshmallow (I only had ice water, no drinks) the bill came up to roughly $50 SGD with GST (There is no Service Charge here). With tip, I was out of there, full and satisfied with a great meal for under $60 SGD. That may seem like a lot of money but for the quality of what you get food wise, that's a very good deal for Singapore in my book. I look forward to coming back again someday in the future to try the rest of the menu, and to get my pork fix

For a different dining experience in a semi-casual setting set in a shop lot; with a purpose built long kitchen-top seating arranged with a frontal view of the chef and his busy staff; this is as good as it gets especially if you don't mind abit of the BBQ smoke on your clothes! Our lunch was enjoyable. We had leek, pulled pork burger, beef and blueberry cake. Total bill as in the low S$100s excluding drinks
5
I don't think have enjoyed a meal, if you can call it that we had I think 8 dishes to share over the courses of a few hour, and everyone was fantastic. Such a novel idea and so rewarding to visit.The only drawback of the whole evening was the snippy barman who got orders wrong, failed to apologised and then acted like a spoiled child all night.So order from the kitchen staff and ignore the bar guy and i think you will have an amazing experienc

Restaurant is small, with most of the seating area ata counter facing the well organized kitchen staff. There is a lot of attention to the quality and cooking style of the food , which is great for a Singapore restaurant. There is a relatively limited menu but the attention to detail in what they cook and serve is excellent. The pulled pork sandwich was great in taste, portion, and presentation. Price was adequate. The grilled octopus was more braised than anything else and was probably overcooked as it lacked texture and bite. No grilling or somokiness detected in this dish. The "cube beef" was properly grilled and flavor was excellent. Having said that, it was way overpriced at $75 for 100gms. I ordered 200 gms, which weighed in at 220 and of which 30 was fatty tissue. , In the end this beef dish was $165 which by any standard is just mere abuse of the customer. I d di not taste the bruschetta with roasted tomatoes, but i saw it being prepared and it looked like a work of art. I assume the taste was just as good. If you want a good pulled pork sandwich, this place is an excellent choice. If you are looking for excellent beef at a price that matches quality, flavor, and portion, this is not the place
5
To keep it simple, I like what these guys do. I like how small their place is, I like their concept, I like how much care they take in their product. A friend told me about this place before a recent trip to SGP. I ended up having both lunch and dinner there. This has never happened, ever. If you like BBQ-esque food. Go, this place will open to your mind to the possibilities
3
Really disappointed, waiting staff either weren't knowledgable or have poor english and the food really sadly didn't live up to the hype. We left after trying three things and ended up at tippling club (fantastic as always).
5
Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service. Very clever menu, dishes are well presented and very tasty. The open kitchen concept really works, it is interesting to watch such a professional team at work. Highly recommend it!
4
The price was according with the quality, the portions was not big but are pretty good. The environment was nice, and the service was ok
5
What started as a exploratory evening on Keong Kaik uncovered two places we will be going back to regularly. The Library for its fantastic cocktails, music and staff and Burnt Ends for it's simply stunning food. Takes a little time to figure out how to manage the menu but every dish was superb in its own right, the pulled pork sandwich the best I have ever had anywhere. Tried to book for mid week but word is already out there and getting a seat maybe the tougher than getting a bad dish. Compliments to the staff who were both engaging and informed. We'll be back......soon
5
Dinner with friends at one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore... And yet again they did not disappoint. The food was perfect! Loved the burnt carrots and the pull pork sandwiches are as good as ever. Duck hearts were a hit too as well as the rump with bone marrow. The head chef was not in that night and guess what? You couldn't even tell. Wonderful team in the kitchen as well as front of the house.Always amazing!!!

Service was prompt, food was excellent.Things you should try:The Burnt Ends' Sanger, which is a pull-pork bun! Really almost Flavour with an awesome blend of cheese and cabbages. A must try!The Rump Cap with bone marrow. It has a great Flavour and the texture is beyond words.We managed to grab their specials; the suckling pig - belly part. Meat was tender and the skin was crisp. Very well done! Overall, a great place to try out.The only cons is reservation is on two time slots, 6pm or 6.30pm which is usually full. That seats round the kitchen. However, if you are trying your luck of walk in you get a wall-facing seat when you walk in which might be a little difficult if you're slight big size as you'll be bumped as the patrons or servers walk past! All in all, must try!
4
We tried this on a chance - no reservation, but had heard good things. Had to sit at the side initially, but didn't mind the inconvenience once we tasted the food. Everything we ordered was phenomenal (except the desert which was okay by comparison). It's a bit loud, crowdy and trendy, but I'll put up with all of that for such a well-conceived and superbly-executed meal
4
Hip place in a great neighbourhood. The food is excellent and comes in dishes to share. Very courteous waiters. However , we arrived at 20:30pm and a third of the menu was gone ..unavailable. Wine prices were a rip off at 28dollars for sip of Australian Pinot or Blends from 2013 !!!(1year old wine ). You can also have bees for 16 dollars from a huge list ..this place is more or less first come first serve with a two hours waiting list. Good music .Overall bill was 200 dollars for two with just 2 glasses of wine, no dessert

The buzz is that this is a 'modern Australian barbecue' joint. It's rather more refined than slapping a steak on the grill, with a wide variety of dishes, many of which no doubt hail from the ex-pat Aussie chef's time spent in Spain. This is a place that's serious about barbecuing, with the restaurant built around a gigantic wood-fired oven that also provides a plentiful supply of hot coals for the three additional grills. Superb meats (as you'd expect) but also some other great touches - a dish of salmon, egg and watercress where the salmon is smoked to order. The service is warm and engaging but they try to be a little too efficient, so if you're a slow eater, guard your plate, lest your waiter think you're done and see it whisked away. The metal framed seats along the counter aren't outrageously comfortable, but having prime seats to watch the kitchen team go about their craft is great viewing. Reservations are only available for spots at 6 or 6.30pm so if you're a group, ring and ask about getting the chef's table, or be early

The price is affordable, the food has flavor, and the ambience is good.I been at least 3 times and the only thing I can say is than if I repeat is because I like it. The portions are not very generous but is composted for the great flavor and for an affordable price. For sure I will come back again
1
Good food but the q for tables doesn't work so very dissapointed with lies from maitre d. Won't be going back. Smaller pain point was around cutlery, they put it on dirty table between dishes like a cheap buffet.
3
It's a shame there is nothing on the wine list for less than $94... we all know there are some great wines available at a lesser price. The food was super nice and presented well. The impression we got was the staff recognise the regular 'money' and the rest of us are just lucky to eat there. Keep up the great food, mellow down the attitude, and this place will be more enjoyable, sadly just average for us
3
Sitting opposite the open kitchen and cooks who are preparing the dishes is a great dining experience - you feel like you are part of the action. It's great to see an Aussie chef doing things differently here in Singapore.However, I thought the menu items were overpriced (other than the pork sanger which was excellent) and the suckling pig was a little overrated - I would have enjoyed it more if it had come out with some veges and a little more gravy/jus. I was also surprised there wasn't a bottle on the wine list for less than $100, and I couldn't bring myself to paying $30 for a glass of Tassie bubbly. That said, I really liked the ambience of the restaurant and it is in a funky part of China Town
4
It was a need for meat to change pastes and rice with small pieces of fish and meat in spiced sauces.Finally a rib of beef for the ones and the true fish (Saint-Pierre) for the others.The well roasted whole.Another food, other wines like those of Australia (in white as in red)For Singapore, the prices remain reasonable in comparison with other restaurants of the district
4
The private table comes at a fixed price, but is really incredible value given all the food you receive. The food is more hit than miss with some beautiful dishes like the pork chop and whole baked fish with fennel (which is brilliant) surrounded by some confident, slightly unusual food to keep things interesting. Overall, a very good experience which is recommended. The service is not overly attentive but is reasonably competent.
5
Provided you're not vegetarian this is truly one of the best restaurants we've been to in Singapore. Almost sat in the kitchen, this is a dining experience not to be missed (and worth the wait given the no-booking policy after 6:30pm) - the food is superb, and if you arrive early/order ahead you can enjoy the sumptuous crackling pig. The zero service charge is a nice touch, but you will leave wanting to give something after a great evening out. You can also book a booth for dining with parties of ~6 and the Chef will create a terrific degustation menu for you and friends. We've loved every dinner we have had here and will continue to return

Heard all about Burnt Ends and the difficulty in getting a reservation. the partner and i finally managed to get a lunch slot on our anniversary. we heard only rave reviews but sorely disappointed. more misses than hits in our orders. the menu changes everyday (or so we over-heard). we were moved once to accommodate other guests and was placed at a corner so missed out on the action in the open-kitchen. we started off with the oysters - which was fresh but nothing to shout about. we had the mini octupus which is really a mini octopus - slightly grilled with sea salt. we had the kingfisher which came out burnt - living up to the restaurant's name - but it was charred beyond recognition and bitter, we figured out that we probably should peel the first layer away to have the meat instead. the sangers was the better part of the meal but not worth it's price tag - it tasted alot like tuna sandwich to me. the partner had the beef steak but it was too well-done and tough for his liking. we were sorely disappointed and definitely not worth the price tag and rave reviews. interesting concept but better food needed to sustain their reputation
3
Was at Burnt Ends on a Monday evening, thankfully we made a reservation and arrived by 645pm. The bar was 80% filled up by then, and we were allocated 2 seats away from the last set of diners at the bar (realised later that a Caucasian couple were ushered to those seats, and they were really later came in ard 720pm).The food was OK, especially enjoyed the rump steak that we ordered. The uni was also really delicious. My main issue was that the staff seemed a lot friendlier and chatted up with mainly the Caucasian diners and the rest were just kinda left aside.Not the best dining experience from a restaurant thats received so much hype
4
This is a fun restaurant and the interaction with the diner and the chef was fun. The food was all tasty and good and overall we liked the experience. This is simple food and the vegetables and meat were well prepared and flavorful. This is a good place to explore a different concept in Singapore and worth a visit
3
After having read so much reviews, I decided to visit. The concept is unique and food quality was good. It would be good if the chefs interacted a bit with guests in front of them as the sitting is at kitchen counter. Service was fine but nothing special
3
We loved the concept although there is a reason why burnt food is not served in restaurants. Sure the charcoal flavour can enhance but sometimes it was simply just a burnt overpowering flavour. Sitting at the kitchen bench would be more enjoyable if the chefs in front of you actually acknowledged your presence. I sum up the night by saying that the very delicious marshmallows at the end of the night were cooked with a butane blow torch -what the??
5
This place was recommended by a staff of Andrea Restaurant. Made a booking by phone a month ago for dinner and was told that I could only reserve for 6pm or 6.30pm. As timing is too early for me to rush from work, I settled the booking on Vesak Day at 6.30pm.I walked pass but missed the entrance as the door was small and signage was not obvious. Dimly lighted with a row of counter seats in front of the open kitchen and a table with six seats at the end of the counter a step down. The best thing of this place was that there was no smoke though they have an open kitchen serving BBQ food. The bearded Australian chef looked fierce but I was told that he is not. The waitress spoke to us in Chinese as my wife is a Taiwanese. She patiently went through the menu and drink list with us and recommend food for us. Yes, the food, service, ambience were all good. Thank you! - 14.5.1

Singapore is now replete with restaurants that tell you what you are going to eat and taking pretension to the highest level. Burnt Ends does nothing of the sort. This is full bodied flavorful food prepared in a unique four ton over overseen by a group of bearded chets who one can tell loves food as much as their customers. A roasted leek dish with hazel nuts is miraculous in it's simplicity as is roasted duck hearts and slabs of flavoursome ribs of beef. A rather self absorbed mixologist creates some of the most interesting cocktails to be found in this city from obscure spirits. The only caveat to this is that they do not take reservations so early and late diners are more likely to get a seat at the long bar like counter. Worth the inconvenience and wait if necessary... so much better than the new wave trendy places that seem to have taken over the Singaporean dining scene
5
Had dinner there with my husband and my 2 teenagers. The waitress recommended our meal and it was great! From the leek appetizer to the rump and the lobster, truly top-rated. Include the cozy ambiance, the pleasant atmosphere and quick conversations with the chef and his staff. It was a fantastic dinner on our first night in Singapore. I shall return
1
Rude front of house. Arrogant without the product to back it up. We were told we would be called in 45 minutes. We came back an hour later and they said "if we didn't call you, there is nothing you. Go away and we might call you". No wonder these restaurants come and go so quickly. You'll love it if you love rude people.
4
the main gripe is that you need like a month's prior reservation. They have one seating at about 6pm for dinner for which there are reservations, you can try to leave your name at the door earlier and hope for a call if you don't have a reservation. If you are lucky you may be top of a 30 person walk in waiting list on SaturdaysEverybody in the restaurant had the pulled pork burger. Pretty decentBeef rump was good, the onion sauce was amazing. great value for steak, if you are fine with this cut.Friendly, staff, nice settingand price wise we were really surprised as it much less than what you expect for one of these modern places
5
I went again last night to Burnt Ends for the third time and I have to say it was amazing. The food, service and ambience is all excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant and just ask the Chef to look after your dining choices. You are sure to have an amazing meal
5
Loved every and all of the many bits put upon my plate.......maybe the octopus was just a little well octopussy, delicious anyway.Not a plate went out that was not passed and checked. We were lucky to be seated just in front of the 'action'. If you aren't familiar with the concept of tapas you have to go
5
I have been to Burnt Ends three times -- as a New Yorker, I look forward to eating there again on my next trip to Singapore. There something for everyone of every diet preference. Delicious food. The "burning" brings out the intense flavor. The high quality ingredients give the freshness of taste. Check out the special grill and oven. When I was there with my family for lunch, they were preparing a small suckling pig for dinner time (which I've had before, and it was superb). A long narrow bar with a small table forum to 8 people. Have lunch or dinner there, and then walk around historic Chinatown. Nice to see young culinary talent do well
3
There were many things we loved about the restaurant except for our main course and the service, which fell short of expectations by a long shot. Everything from the cocktail to the starters and small plates were phenomenal. We ordered the rump tip as a main and it was very chewy and tough - perhaps one of the worst steaks I've had in recent years. The dessert - both the strawberry tart and the banana and caramel were great. While the bartender was great, the overall service was disappointing. The waiter didn't take initiative to walk us through the menu and didn't check up on us mid-service. Frankly, I don't think he cared. At this point, I'm not sure if I'll give the place a second shot.
5
It is rare when I simply do not want to leave the restaurant and feel like trying on and on and on. Can recommend everything. All cooked my favorite way - maximum fire, minimal time.
5
Everything was just amazing. The service was outstanding, food was out of this world, wine a bliss!
Thank you to the great team for a great great night!!
Ps: Manu is the best :)
1
Patronising and rude service. We were very disappointed. The food was good but little better than average. This combined with the fact that the majority of staff appeared to think they were too good to be working in a restaurant almost spoilt the evening.
5
Had dinner there last night and everything was great, beautiful made cocktails and the food is to die for, my favourite was the Sanger!!!!!!! Will be coming back for more..... and more!!!
5
Tried to visit this place earlier without success. As waiting time has been around 2 hours, we have selected another place to dine. This time we decided to succeed, to have our dinner earlier and reserved places for the first setting as later settings are only by queuing. Absolutely worth of it. This place I like. Casual, relaxed atmosphere, attentive service. Staff is focused on their tasks and performs. So much fun to follow the activities in kitchen.Still the most important is the food. Words to describe it: smoke, flame, coal, excellent ingredients, juicy, professional touch, balanced tastes and combinations. Awesome.We started with smoked quail eggs and they made us laugh. Tasty and beautiful soft inside. Same happiness and joy stayed and there wasn't any disappointments.Looking forward to our next visit to explore menu further

All produce are fresh and most go through the fire oven or over the grill cooked in their own juices. The herbs, oils and spices are added and for most of the clients this happens just i front of your eyes. The chef has a good control of the preparation and no shouting is needed to get excellent results. Loved the place
5
We had lunch in Burnt Ends. It is a casual dining restaurant. However, the food are not "casual" at all.The food is good and they are using good quality ingredients to prepare the dishes. Special mention the grill beef that we had. It was excellent! I will definitely go back again
3
3 of us ate here on a monday night afterwork. While the food tasted good, i was not expecting a bill of $180, given we shared a few dishes and had no alcohol or desert. It was very expensive in my opinion but interesting place to visit. You get to see them cook your food right in front of you as you are seated facing the kitchen (not on a table, more like a bar seating). There is only 1 table and that is always booked, so only go if you are a small group, max 3 people or you won't be able to chat to one another (as you will be seated in a row)
5
Have been to Burnt Ends a couple of times now, once sitting at the counter and once on the chef's table. I quite enjoyed both of my experiences. I'm a big fan of interactive eating - chatting to the chef and people eating around you so this restaurant is right up my alley. The food is good and interesting but I wouldn't say mind blowing. A couple of things I especially liked : a massive whole fish, the grilled oyster, the bun and ox tongue. I also like that the menu changes slightly each time you go depending on what they have available. The experience though is different to going to a stiff fine dining restaurant. The first time I went with my husband, the chef gave us some recommendations for his favorite restaurant in London and the people sitting next to us chimed in. It's that kind of detail that made the meal memorable. All in all, a fun way to have dinner with some good food
2
Had been here for dinner a few months ago and thoroughly enjoyed the foodService was grumpy. Sarcastic when we pointed out there was plastic in our cheese. Considering how few seats they have, intention to empty water cups says it all. You should be thankful we let you eat here. Pulled pork was drowning in sauce. And had to do deep dive to find the pork. Lamb and anchovies were yummy though
5
We ate at the bar, enjoyed watching the prep while enjoying shared dishes. Leeks were my fav, pulled pork was a close second. Having eaten local for many months, a well prepared western meal was a great treat.
5
had an enjoyable time at burnt ends. service and quality of food are good, definitely value for money.
5
While the concept of the open kitchen is great, we're there for the food, beer and oh... wine too! Gastronomic delight! The Chefs are lovely, they're brothers with good ol' Australian hospitality. We pretty much eat what they recommend and we get to see them cook it in the grill, right before our eyes
5
We only had to wait an hour on a Friday night for the four of us. We loved the concept and found the food and service fantastic. It was great to dine in a relaxed atmosphere and see the food be prepared - yes just like being at a bbq but you don't have to do the work! Great produce + Great preparation and cooking = a Great night. Staff were friendly and it made a change from some of the "art on a plate" restaurants that we had dined in. Highly recommended and good value for money
3
We have walked past this restaurant many times and it had such a funky vibe and was always packed to the brim whatever night! - hence we were very keen to try it out. As many have said be prepared to wait a while...unless you make a reservation at 6/6:30pm. This is however not a problem as there are many cool bars to have a pre-dinner cocktail. When we did get a table (about an hour later) we were sat down, the menu not explained, wait staff were rude and it seemed like a very long wait until our drink order was taken. The wine was very average - even after we had a recommendation from the staff. The food was a bit hit and miss and half the menu was unavailable as they only prepare so much of each dish. Some courses were absolutely divine - the quail egg and caviar, the leeks in burnt butter sauce and the desserts were heavenly! Unfortunately what we came for was disappointing - the main of beef rump cap was very tough and the sauce was over seasoned. The squid with corn also smelt fishy making me question the restaurants freshness.Overall this place has a very cool concept. The open kitchen is very entertaining to watch, but the food and service is just not at that high standard for us to revisit
4
Firstly, Burnt Ends should be commended for trying to do something a bit different and generally pulls it off very well. The overall experience was excellent and it is worth going simply to watch the chefs in action.Service is good but not overly fussy and the staff know the menu well. The menu is not huge but is comprehensive and well thought out.The couple of starters we had very excellently prepared and extremely good. We did however have an issue with the main course which was the blackened pig. It was wonderfully prepared and very tender but just lacked a bit of taste and character and felt overall a bit flimsy. It was also very expensive with regard to how much of the meat off the bone was edible.I don't eat desserts but my wife assured me they were great.My other big gripe however was the wine list. I completely understand that not all restaurants want to carry big lists and you can of course have a pretty comprehensive but small list.This list was merely small and with all the wines being pulled from Australia only, far more thought and care needs to go into the list. There are many very good Australian wines but not many of them were on this list. Bearing in mind the excellence they are pursuing with the food, the wine choices don't back that up.We'll definitely go again however and I doubt anyone will have a bad meal there
5
This was a great dining experience. Ok its not for everybody, certainly not a romantic venue but if you love food and are interested in its preparation this is a wonderful place to visit. Sitting on a bar facing the food preparation area so that you can see your dish being cooked in the giant ovens you can really understand the work and skill involved. Great wine list as well
5
Fantastic smoky atmosphere, great quality meat cooked in a unique BBQ style and paired with nice Australian wines. The flank steak with bone marrow and burnt onions was delicious and the leaks with burnt butter and hazelnuts a real treat! Will definitely squeeze in another visit soon
5
Came on the recommendation of Zagat Singapore and completely enjoyed the experience! The smoked quail eggs, Grilled Leeks with Hazelnut and Snow Crab were our absolute favorites. Best Crab in the world. The food is grilled to perfection and there wasnt any over-cooking or fancy sauces involved. Simply quality ingredients, superbly cooked with the oven that the chef built. It lets the ingredients breathe and gives them a voice. Service was great, chef David Pynt supervises every dish that was served. Great value for money. We will definitely return
4
Really enjoyed dinner here last night and unlike many restaurants in Singapore I am keen to go back , partly because the menu changes daily, partly cause it was good and also there were dishes I didn't get to try. Highlights from our meal - Quails eggs, leeks , Small Greek cuts with the greek name i cant pronounce and the Pork ... would have liked to try king crab leg but didnt have enough room. Wine by the glass was good and fairly priced so worked for us.Few things to note as mentioned by others: counter dining so best for 2 or 3 people or too unsocial, book for early sitting if you want to avoid facing the wall and see what's going on in the kitchen. Also your clothes are likely to smell a bit, not something that would put me off going back
4
I think this is a jewel in Singapore, one of the few places that meet the value for dollar equation. Its not cheap, its not expensive and the quality of food is very good. My first visit was for lunch, we got off on the wrong foot as there is the snobbery factor with the staff but once you get past that the rest is all downhill. Quail eggs great........and oh my the Sanger is a killer! Did not get around to dessert, next time. Book way in advance, getting in is a pain!Super place for a couple and I would also feel comfortable bringing the family here too for a treat
5
Burnt ends for me represents what hospitality is all about, service with intellect and confidence. They are professionals at ease in an environment which at times can be demeaning, but can these guys carry it off, yes they can. Smoked quail eggs, charred kingfish, rabbit offal, artichokes, perfect bread, spectacular pineapple tart, it was all wonderful. All that was lacking was a quality rosÃ© by the glass, apparently it's not the go to drink for the locals but who am I to argue, especially with a 2007 Pewsey Vale Riesling to savour
4
I was invited for lunch by a business associate and was told that this was relatively new but good. The understated signage and provocative name led to a urban-RUSTIC interior with a PRIMEVAL-industrial edge - altogether just oozing with coolness without trying hard at all. Its a tiny stylish place with a seating arrangement much like a sushi bar overlooking the open kitchen anchored by a huge charcoal-burning oven where most dishes are grilled-roasted-barbequed - hence the name. My host ordered a variety of dishes to share between the three of us and although it was a small sampling, it was enough to exhibit a clarity of culinary thought and vision thats difficult to match. Rather than define it as "simple", "PURE" comes to mind. An earthen dish of glistening boiled quail eggs arrived devoid of any distracting garnish or dressing. A bite reveals salt and smoke and a marvelously soft yolk within - truly delicious. PERFECT slices of roasted duck breast had ham-like consistencies. Never tasted blackened leeks (with brownbutter hazelnut) exuding such NATURAL sweetness. The pulled pork sandwich (Burnt Ends Sanger) was ROBUST, PUNCHY and with excellent bite albeit a tad 'cluttered' compared to the directness of the other offerings. The whole Japanese sea bream was SUPERB-ly grilled and served with great flourish accompanied by a side of fennel & seaweed - its quite a sight! (sorry no pictures!) Finished off the meal with a decent slice of apple-lemon tart and a cuppa straightforward drip coffee (vs machine-made espresso - there's actually a whole story behind that).The rest of the menu is fascinating based on the SPARE & distilled descriptions. Can't wait to go back

I've been excited to try this new restaurant and so last night I was full of happy anticipation. However the experience was so bad that we left after sampling just 3 dishes The restaurant has a lovely open concept but the initial feeling left me after we were told that our booking was for the first seating so we did not have a comfortable seat at the bar/table. Instead we were placed to the side wall, which has the world's most uncomfortable stools. Since we had a confirmed reservation, we were not happy but still appreciated being able to eat. We were hungry, so we opened the menu and ... There are a bunch of interesting items there, but none all that appealing. There is steak- 1kg for 390. There are a bunch of small dishes, which we tried to order but some were not available..I finally ordered oysters- 6 for 36. They came out later and when they placed them in front of me, worms were crawling up from the shell. I sent them back, another 6 returned and ugh, they were fishy and metallic and warm. I sent them back again, they did not taste fresh.The robotic waiter was unmoved by the flatworms crawling down my plate, "it happens," he said. "Yes, but that means they have not been washed" said my friend. Next, salmon skin and roe. My friend ate that. It had little appeal to me. I did not try it. Last dish, squid and about a teaspoon of corn. Uninteresting, cooked well, but not filling. We then decided to leave- to get a proper meal-we called for the bill. We had 4 SMALL glasses of white wine, 6 oysters (we were charged but did not eat) two other tiny plates of food and the bill was $146 Not including service. What? 4 glasses of wine came to $76!! We asked for the oysters to be removed from the bill and they finally consented. Total for a terrible experience which amounted to 4oz of wine and a bite of squid-- $104.. There are many over priced restaurants in Singapore but I will take my Amex elsewhere, where better service, much better food and a decent glass of wine is available. Don't waste your money here

This place is FAB ! really really good food in a cool way. This place knows what it is doing and does it well.Iteresting menu which has been tried and tested as well as new varieties and options. Very skilled chefs prepare and cook the food in front of you as you sit at a bar and watch them do it. They have a calm confident assurance which comes from know that what they prepare and serve will delight and will exceed your expectations. MasterfulComplimenting the food are some well chosen wines.recommendations - the B-B Q leeks ---yes really. Their Fish is superb - simply cooked over charcoal and served perfectly with a dash of fresh lime. also their wonderful homemade ice cream.There is nothing to fault here -- the food - outstanding, the vibe and atmosphere perfect and you get to witness the whole meal being produced just 1 metre from you across the bar ---really adds to and heightens the dining expereince. In short -- GO thereNB only able to book for first sitting at 6:00 pm ----thereafter take your chances around 7:30 = 8:00 and go on spe

We visited here as a a group of four last night and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The people here clearly love their food and enjoy cooking it in front of you in a social environment. They are happy to answer any questions you might have and don't make you feel stupid asking anything. We had the suckling pig and the onglet steak and both were excellent. Service was also attentive and friendly. Ten out of ten
5
We've been back twice now - the first to try out the pulled pork sanga late one night - the second for a longer meal. Both times were exceptional - great service and a friendly bunch of chefs - a cool concept not seen elsewhere in sing and out of this world food. Not sure i would go if we were more than two but for a couples night out this place rock
4
Heard about this place and were intrigued by the concept so decided to head down there as a group of 8. Since the place was recommended by two friends who happen to both be chefs our expectations were high but the team at Burnt Ends lived up to it. Low carb, well balanced, simple but very flavorful. They make use of different protein ingredients so you will find king fish on the bone (not the usual fillet), veal tongue (not the usual loin) etc. Now for a group of food & beverage guys and chefs the highlight is the simplicity but completeness of every dish. Beware though - if you are a traditionalist and expect a fillet steak with truffle mashed potatoes or similar then stay away from it :) The upside of the place: the chef is super humble, loves to interact, shows genuine interest in feedback and receives it sincerely, cares about his food and ingredients used. The downside: the majority of the seating surrounds the kitchen so if you are a larger group of people it is impossible to communicate but this didn't stop us from enjoying, especially since we love to watch and smell our food being prepped right there in front of your nose. As the name of the restaurant suggests - get ready to walk out of there as if you were standing at the griddle all night yourself. Value for money is very good and the fact that you are part of the restaurant and not just a guest at the table make it winner in every way
3
Food above average,interesting and reasonably well executed. Seating layout not conducive to a more social evening and if you want to go home smelling like you've been at a bonfire then you'll be right on the money. Our expectations were high based on the recommendations of trusted friends, but things didn't start well and went down from there. Despite the minor issues the service let the whole thing down completely. We waited for some friends, who were running late, and were asked if they were joining us... Not from idol concern but more for 'i want your seats'. And so the surliness began....Throughout the meal there were interjections of both an ill timed and unwelcome nature. What was an above average meal was totally undermined by second rate service in the form of attitude from the bearded waiter. To compound this, the only major flaw from the kitchen was their apparent inability to make a simple coffee. Despite this we pressed on with a single cappuccino ordered for one of our party which neither materialised at the table nor thankfully on the bill.In summary, if you can tolerate the surliness of 'el beardo' the waiter,if you don't like coffee after your meal and you're planning a visit to the dry cleaners the next day then.you may be happy. What is certainly above average food is let down by everything else.Guys - take it from me... While you're on the up invest more money in your ventilation system (and copper fasten your concept) and get your staff to understand the real dynamics of dealing with customers who may come back for something that is 10% better
4
To classify the Food Category of Burnt Ends as barbeque is like calling truffle Mould. I wish my barbeques at home could turn out this way. Everything does NOT taste the same here because not only are the marinades different, but also the textures of the meats come across so beautifully. I love the kingfish. It came alarmingly blackened, but the flavour of the miso was perfect. The Sanger pork slider was also meltingly tender. The kurobuta was so simple, but it was the most succulent rib I have ever had. The piece de la resistance has to be the onglet. I'm glad we ordered 240g for the 3 of us. Would have gladly finished it off solo. I didn're care for the salmon skin topped with oyster cream and ikura. Skin wasn't crispy and oysters had the icky muddy smell. But hey, I'm not an oyster aficionado anyway.
