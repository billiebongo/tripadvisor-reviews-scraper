We had a vegetarian sampler that was super hot and super delicious.
The naan was made fresh and hot
We had a rice and mutton dish that was out of this world.

The rates are cheap but the quality is above average. Service is fast and cleanliness of the hotel is just OK.
For the money what you pay this hotel is one of a good option.

Functional restaurant. Had an awesome dosa masala with poppodams. Quick service, tasty food. Not a fancy place but it fills you up. Great prices.

I loved it. Inexpensive and plentiful- see picture.
So simple but so tasty! Staff were great.
I like Little Indian on a Saturday. Highly recommended.

Me and my wife were in today for lunch. Service was excellent even though the place was very busy. We recommend the butter chicken (good for people who don't like spicy food) and the garlic and cheese naan

We were guided by a local to try this restaurant and it was a good to enjoy your hefty breakfast there.Food tastes good and quantity is sufficient. There's lot of local people eating there ...but still their service is fast . We tried different dosa and chicken briyani there. All tasted like authentic south Indian food . There's seating area inside and outside both..

I am now a huge fan of South Indian food despite being Pakistani all thanks to this curry house! The restaurant is admittedly sub average in ambiance and could do more but they food they present is mouthwatering and certified Halal, I recommend the fish Biryani and onion dosa.The head water was very polite and jolly and made me and my wife feel at home. His service was so good he immediately sent us piping hot food once we told him we felt it was a tad cold. he would also ask us at appropriate intervals if we needed anything.I would definitely give a shout out to this restaurant as it is hygienic and flavorsome. If InshaAllah I get the opportunity to go to Singapore i would definitely revisit this place

This was next to our hotel so we went there a few times but this place was not very clean. Waiter was eager to take order and dump food, no basic courtesy. Food was equally bland and tasteless. This place gave me feeling that this is meant for some workers in the area rather than tourist however compared with quality of food, place is decently priced. Can take South Indian breakfast at times here as this place opens up in early in morning
