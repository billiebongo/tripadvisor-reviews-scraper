Terrible service !! Food is cold , ask the food server to had hot Tim sum . Server not happy at all ! Had not started to eat , full of anger already .

We came for Chinese New Year lunch and realised there is no dim sum and Peking duck on the menu due to the festive period. Of all the dishes we ordered, the BBQ sauce black cod is the best. The menu booklet was also a let down like it was hastily created. Service is alright but not super, staff are courteous and up beat but 1 was too eager to clear the dishes.Would come to try the dim sum next time but not during festive
4
We came here for dinner and had some Chinese dishes like crab meat soup, steam fish, soy sauce chicken, stir fried vegetables and lotus leaf rice. The food was delicious and had strong flavors, which was typical of Cantonese cuisine.Overall, the service was good too

I went on a Sunday right as they opened at 10:30 a.m. as I was advised it got busy. There were a few people also waiting but it didn't get busy until about 11:30 a.m. This is not a traditional dim sum place with carts, it's white table cloth and rather fancy. You order all your dim sum off a menu, which was actually a disappointingly small selection. I ordered:- Shumai- Beef balls- Tofu skins (both steamed and fried)- Steamed BBQ pork buns- Pastry desertEverything was quite good, although nothing was outstanding except the pastry desert which was delightfully fluffy and light. The crispy tofu skins were my 2nd favorite - very crispy and light, not greasy and very flavorful. The pork bao filling was a little sweet/thick for my taste, and the shiu mai were just ok. For the price, I think I will explore other dim sum options next time I'm in town

This is the first time I came to this restaurant. It is located at the second floor of Carlton Hotel. The hotel is along Bras Basah Road, a 5-min walk from City Hall MRT station. I came here for a gathering with some of my ex-secondary classmates. The one who organized the gathering is one of my ex-classmates who is currently working at the hotel and thus, she probably has the staff discount privilege.I was the first to arrive at the restaurant. The restaurant only opened at 6.30 pm and you are denied access until it opens at 6.30 pm. I then decided to roam around. Right beside the restaurant on the same level were few rows of ballrooms. There was an annual dinner and dance for one of the government ministry staff and came with a Wild Wild Wet theme. Many of the staff came in cow boy suit. Another ball room was for a seminar on investing in property in Hong Kong. I then decided to wait at the lobby located at the ground floor. I eventually met one of my ex-classmates and by then, it was 6.30 pm and we were ushered to our table. I found the dining area brightly lit. The staff was quick to serve us with tea. You can feel the ambiance of a typical traditional Chinese restaurant with the decorative wooden carving, tables and chairs and some Chinese calligraphy on the wall. The service was prompt and the waitresses were courteous. I noticed a number of the customers were Caucasians and were with some Chinese friends. The food was appetizing and fulfilling with suckling pig, steam chicken, steam sea bass and of course, lohei to celebrate the coming Chinese New Year. We had a hearty and wonderful dinnertime sharing many stories of our lives in the past 40 years since graduation from secondary school. The ambiance is conducive for our gathering and the service is prompt. A slight complaint is the high salt content in the food and we were all seniors and the high salt content definitely will trigger a unwanted surge in our blood pressure. It probably was the characteristic of a Cantonese cuisine. I supposed the cost per table is on the high end since the restaurant is located within a high end hotel located right in the middle of the city. Anyway, we had an enjoyable gathering and hearty chit chat during the gathering much thanks to the conducive atmosphere in the restaurant

We where host to lunch at Wah lok and extremely happy with the menu, service and great quality meal. Jasmine tea was a WOW for my kids and the overall experience was outstanding. A lovely restaurant in the city. Well worth a visit if you want great food

We booked a table for New Year's eve at this restaurant. The atmosphere was very rushed, we felt like we were in a fast food restaurant. We ordered a 6 course meal. Unfortunately, we were literally rushed out of the restaurant. Within 90 minutes we were out. The table next to us ordered the same menu and was served every course while still eating the previous course. The food was okay, definitely nothing to remember or write home about. Way too expensive for quality and service.
3
This place was quite busy for lunch but the food and service left lot to be desired. First of all, There were many set tables available but they still seated us in a table that was not properly set up . The service is lack luster and the Peking duck was a joke which had no meat in it and only the skin. Waiter Quite unhelpful with suggestions and dim sums were quite ordinary. For the prices charged , the food is simply way below standard
5
This restuarant has very nice food and dim sum. For dim sum, I recommend the baked cha siow pau, century egg porridge. I loved the roasted pork which is cut into mini cute squares, most of the desserts are worth a try. The staffs are friendly, the restuarant is very cold and if you forgot to bring your sweater, ladies, you just have to inform the staff,they will provide you a shawl on loan,this extra service is very much appreciated. This place has a very nice settings too

We visit this friendly Cantonese fine food restaurant as often as we can. The food is truly outstanding, both the traditional dishes and the more adventurous ones. Service is also attentive and welcoming. We’re never disappointed with quality but would rate this one of the best Cantonese restaurants anywhere if only they didn’t let the food cool down before they served it, and didn’t aggravate the problem by running the air conditioning so cold. We’ll still keep going for the wonderful tastes and brisk service, but getting the temperature right would be marvellous.
5
The dim sum was good as the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The Peking duck was good but needed a bit more smoke. Overall a wonderful meal but expensive so be ready to burn a hole in your wallet.
5
We went there with Singaporean friends. Food is very good especially duck skin. Desserts are also nice and this is real experience to discover true Chinese cuisine
5
The food, the service and entire experience could not be faulted,
staff were extremely efficient and courteous, however its all about the food, the taste, variety and presentation was outstanding.
4
Always very impressed with the food and service quality for Wah Lok @ CArlton. The polo char siew bun is to die for, amongst the other dim sum on the menu. That said, nothing is perfect. If you are a “dumpling” person, theirs is not the best. So you might want to save your stomach for other food like roast pork, egg tarts, Cheong fun etc. The staff are friendly and very considerate. A very enjoyable brunch/ dim sum experience with my family. Thank you Wah Lok for the great experience as always!

Was there in Oct 2017 for celebrating my friend's birthday. Other than Peking Duck, other dishes like premium soup, pork ribs, baked cod, veg dish, even dessert, were all not up to standard, a far cry from our visit earlier this year. For sure, the chef is not the usual but we found the taste of the dishes sadly unacceptable
5
It's probably the best traditional dimsum place I have visited in Singapore. While dimsum remains the main attraction to visit this place, the other dishes are also awesome. What I like best about the place is its authenticity to the Cantonese cuisine. It's not an entirely chic-chic place, but it definitely is towards the expensive side. What I have found consistently in such restaurants in SG, that they improve the dishes with many modern twists and turns (say truffle or foie gras dimsum for example), but not Wah Lok. They keep it 100% traditional and keeps the rich taste of the Cantonese cuisine.Revisit likelihood - multiple time
5
Our party of 16pax was easily given a table. Tatler awards plates were displayed in front and it's true! Service, food and ambience very good! We had peking duck and it was delicious. Also the prawns in duck egg was also very good. I thought food used less MSG since I didn't get thirsty right after dinner. Service was top-class.
5
Went for Sunday dim sum. Make sure you book as its very busy.I had such a great experience.From the beginning my email reservation was handled promptly by James.We arrived earlier than our reservation. We went for the second sitting at 12.45 pm.But didnt have to wait at all.The dim sum was outstanding.! Roast pork - melt in your mouth.Steamed carrot cake, prawn dumplings, xiao long bau, eu fu noodles ,siew mai all cooked to perfection! They also have a fantastic selection of desserts.I also loved the sevice here. The staff were so attentive , even noticing my mother needed a fork before we asked for one. Their speedy service was a real delight.I highly recommend this place! Its great dim sum. And excellent prices
5
Recommended by a friend - no regrets.Great food and service! Even the elderly liked their dim sum. Some dishes may be a little salty but it is acceptable. 2 seatings over weekend 11am or 1pm. We chose 1pm and we arrived at 12.30pm. Hostess was nice enough to give us a table earlier as she saw that most of my guests are senior citizens.Like their Saturday special - fish dish and fried rice. Glutinous rice, BBQ meat, fried noodles, carrot cake, custard bun, har kow, siew mai, chicken pie etc were nice. I like the selection of desserts too - I ordered the apple jelly. Nice and refreshing.Service is good too and efficient even though the place is busy.Price - ..... not cheap though.....Will definitely be back again
4
It had been quite a while since the last visit to Wah Lok. Although the standard of food seemed to have dipped a bit, it was nonetheless still the best as compared to the other dim sum places in Singapore. The service was very good - staff were polite and service was efficient, and the ambiance was nice. Overall a pleasant dining experience
5
Dim sum here only served during lunch, and is one of the best in Singapore. Reservation is recommended, especially for weekend lunch.
4
Really nice place to dine! The six of us will lucky to be given a private room. Service was impeccable! We did not hv to wait long for our dim sum. Century eggs porridge was very tasty, all of us has the same comment. The Steamed n the Polo (pastry style) BBQ Pork Buns were great, the fillings had a nice sweetness n saltiness. The chicken pies n Siew Mai were average. Loved the stewed chicken feet, nice softness n very delicious.
5
Having just arrived in Singapore, suffering with jet lag after 13 hr flight & not knowing anywhere or anything we opted for the restaurant in our hotel, always a safe bet but we were not disappointed! Meal was amazing & waiter was helpful explaining & giving advice regarding various dishes. Not cheap but highly recommend it

Popular Cantonese restaurant with a decent dim sum offering (no carts, ordering off the menu). You get a table for an hour and a half, at least at the weekend, which is plenty of time because the service is slick and the kitchen is well organised. Limited but good range of dim sum complemented by other dishes. Pastry is excellent especially for items like the har gau (prawn dumplings) and crab with egg white dumplings. Cheong fan was fine though the prawns worked better than the scallops. There is a slightly bigger choice of desserts than, say, in London. We weren't so convinced by at least one of the specials, which tend to be more expensive, as the delicate flavour of the razor shell clams was overpowered by the garlic based sauce. Agreeable, light room with enough space between the tables to make for a comfortable meal and conversation. No issue bringing a baby with a suitable chair immediately available.
5
We were looking for a dim sum restaurant in Singapore and found this place in the Carlton Hotel. It is very fancy, with fancy prices. But there is a special dim sum luncheon menu with prices averaging USD 5 a dish. We had a great lunch for USD 27 but we are light eaters. If you are good eaters this will be expensive. Service and ambience were great. Recommend dishes: baked BBQ pork buns and the crabmeat dumplings. Each dish comes with 3 pieces. You are charged for the tea, pickles on the table and a 10% service charge.
4
Visited Wah Lok restaurant in the Carlton Hotel for the first time today for dim sum. Good selection and quite reasonable prices with efficient service. We were quite fortunate to get a table without a reservation as it was fairly busy: next time I will probably make the reservation in advance

This was a Chinese New Year lunch hosted for our customer.Wah Lok is well known to serve excellent Cantonese style Chinese cuisine. They have a respectful history, having been established in 1988.In fact, they are an award-winning restaurant located on the second level of the Carlton Hotel, which is centrally located in Singapore.The hotel lobby is in pleasing, luxurious beige and earthy hues.This Chinese restaurant has a classy entrance, with modern decor yet beautiful and sophisticated ambience.Their service was really attentive, yet non-obtrusive.Although it was the peak period of Chinese New Year Lo Hei lunches, they still held on to their impeccable standard of offering well executed Cantonese style Chinese dishes, with efficient service being accorded to us.Recommended for an enjoyable Chinese dining experience, in an elegant restaurant ambience.We were given a private dining room, which was condusive for a business lunch

In mid-Feb, my eldest sister treated her younger siblings and myself to this place for dinner. She commented that this place usually have very good dim sum for lunch, and that night was the first time we had dinner in that restaurant. One of the siblings like fried food, so my sister ordered fried salmon skin, which was actually crispy and not too oily. The cucumber as a starter was very refreshing. The preserved egg was also just right, to the taste of the mouth. The geoduck was cooked nicely. The crispy duck was also delicious, and the fish was very well cooked. The beancurd vegetable soup was refreshing too. The spare ribs were perfect too. The beancurd was soft. The minced meat paste noodle could have been done a lot better, in my honest view. The manageress chatted to my eldest sister for a while, as to what needed to be improved for future dinner banquets. I can tell that she is really sincere and serious in maintaining the good reputation of the restaurant. Likely to go back to this restaurant if I am in Singapore again in the future
5
One of the best places to eat Dim Sum in Singapore. Exceptionally good customer service, very attentive staff. I had char siew (one of the best), century egg porridge, siew mai, carrot cake, prawn dumplings, custard buns, and everything was good. I would love to eat at this restaurant again!
5
On short notice, I hosted a table for 10 last Friday evening while in Singapore on a business trip. I did not have time to pick the menu and went for a set banquet offering. The waiting staff was very helpful in assisting me with my selection. I specifically wanted a banquet with a whole suckling pig. That was delicious as were all the selected items, a double boiled winter melon soup, seared scallops, braised abalone, steamed fish, fried noodles and local grass jelly dessert plus assorted other desserts. All these were washed down with Oyster Bay Merlot from New Zealand.The great service from the waiting team made the entire evening an enjoyable one.No wonder Wah Lok is so well regarded amongst Foodies of Singapore
4
Beautiful setting for delicious Cantonese food and dim sum. This place has been around many years, which is a testament to the food and service.

Definitely a must try
Roast chicken. Sgd 48
Century egg Sgd 15
Sauteed scallops Sgd 63
My fav glutinous rice Sgd 57!
Go!

Made reservation 2 days in advanced. Staffs were very attentive and lunch was good. We ordered few signature dim sum, including their bo lo bun, peking duck was good!
Would come back to try other dishes!
5
Had dim sum at Wah Lok for lunch about a week ago. Be sure to make reservation to avoid waiting. The quality of food was good and they have attentive waiters and waitresses. Hotel guests get 10% discount for spending at Wah Lok.
5
I have been dining in Wah Lok for many years and even though we always go there in family of four quite a few of your staff remember us. We always love the dim sum there as their quality & taste of food are always consistent. Besides the food, their staff will always try their best to make our dining experience a great one especially their long serving staff, Mei Ling! She always go out of her way to ensure everything is going ok for us. Never once our tea cup was left empty no matter how packed the restaurant is. After so many years of dining there I don't recall ever having to ask for tea to be topped up. Mei Ling and her colleague'a impeccable service do really keep guests going back. Keep up your good work ya!!
5
There may be many more better places but would need a lot of time to find anything to the standard of Wah Lok. Having dined here on many, many occasions for simple lunch or extravagant celebrations it has always been a first class experience.Highly recommended and well located
5
We came to this place on a Saturday afternoon for the dim sum buffet. The selection available was varied and would suit the appetite and palate of various diners. The service was great and staff were prompt in taking our orders as well as ensuring our Chinese tea was constantly topped up. Additionally, the place has a wonderful ambience. Overall it was a nice and enjoyable experience dinning at Wah Lok and I look forward to my next visit to the restaurant.
5
Food was fantastic. So much so that I did not take any photos of the food and started digging in the moment it arrived. To add, waiting time for the food is actually quite long and I was really famished when it eventually arrived. There were some really unique dim sums like the chilli crab buns. The lobster noodles and vegetables set were really good and worth the money.The place looks fantastically grand and I believe that it has been a well-known name in the yum cha realm. During peak seasons, you may have to book in advance for a Sunday brunch slot. Even though you may have gotten a slot, the crowd that gathers outside the restaurant before it opens is quite a sight to behold. In summary, do book in advance to avoid disappointment. The food is worth the hassle

@TheKuoKnowsIs Wah Luk the best Cantonese restaurant in Singapore? It's certainly up there with some of Singapore's finest.The Dim Sum is more than a couple of notches above outstanding. But that level of service comes at a price - Wah Luk is not for the budget-conscious.The quality of the Char Siu Bao is undeniably good; the Fried Carrot Cake is outstandingly fragrant and the Cheung Fun is sinfully silky.But do consider the many dishes outside of the dim-sum selection. The roast meats are top drawer.And always ask about the soup of the day. In my case it was Lotus Root with Pork. It was Heaven in a bowl.Wah Luk is an excellent standard bearer for high-quality Dim Sim in Singapore. It's well worth a visit just to experience what is possible when attention is put to detail
5
It has been a long time since my last visit. Our entire clan of 11 had lunch on Sunday and the menu has been refreshed and the current favourits are pork Polo buns and the diced abalone pies. All in the yum cha was very good. They have 2 sittings on weekends and it would be best to call and book since they are super popular. The sittings are at 11am and 1pm, so those at 11am would have to finish and leave before 1pm. I was also surprised that despite my late same morning request they had the little peach-shaped lotus-paste buns to celebrate my mother's birthday with

Great ambiance and setting, very good food, good service quality and hospitable staff. Worth a visit !
5
I m hard to pls when it come to cNtonese food but Wah Lok serves some really tasty dishes that makes u come back for more. U must try the soup & Peking duck.
4
This is a well known Chinese restaurant at the edge of orchard road. Has good range of dim sum, Cantonese dish. Service is excellent and staff is friendly
4
Came here Sunday for brunch. Since we didn't make reservation, we have to wait approx half an hour for our table. The dim sum definitely high quality. I have to specially compliment our waitress (she's an older lady that's station in one of the private room that they turned to 3-4 tables during dim sum). Her attentiveness is just amazing. She's extremely polite and really pay attention to our table. I have to say, it's hard to find someone like her these days. Our hats off to the management of Wah Lok
5
Accompanied by Singapore friends we enjoyed an excellent dinner experience comprising tasty Cantonese shared food options including prawn, steamed fish, and duck mains. Our experience was enhanced by our beautiful surroundings and most engaging staff with quirky humour and excellent food knowledge. We will certainly return and recommended
5
I've had 2 meals here - dim sum for lunch and Chinese dishes for dinner. Very good meals both times. The food is authentic Cantonese cuisine, service is friendly and efficient. They have servings of small, medium and large. The dishes has what we Chinese call "wok hei" - the flavor that is produced from high heat cooking from the Chinese wok. The dessert like walnut and almond paste has good flavour and. Or overly sweet. Pricing is slightly on the medium to high range but still acceptable given its location and quality. Definitely a place I will revisit. I heard a lot of business people like to entertain their guests at this place
4
We enjoyed half duck pancakes (they add both the meat and skin) followed by 3 of the small plates (prawn black bean, eggplant Beancurd and minced pork (yum!) and chicken kampong). This was plenty for 3 people. Prompt service and very efficient care at the table (I think we drank 5 pots of tea!). 4 stars only as the welcome desk and person taking the order were a bit "straight-faced", but otherwise a good evening enjoyed
5
If you like Cantonese cuisine then you cannot miss out this Chinese restaurant in Carlton Hotel. The award-winning Wah Lok Cantonese Restaurant (since 1988) served authentic Cantonese cuisine & I simply love their Tim Sum. Roast chicken is one of my favourite. Super crispy golden brown skin, tender & moist succulent meat. You mustn't miss their Roast Pork Belly (Siu Yuk) too. Fat little cubes of juicy pork and crackling. The golden crispy skin with tender and juicy belly meat. As you take a bit into the crispy skin, the skin literally cracks in your mouth like crackers.Something not so greasy? How about steam Siu Mai in Cantonese or Shaomai in Mandarin and Ha Gao in Cantonese, meaning “Shrimp Dumpling”, are one of the most popular item on the menu in the dim sum restaurant. It is always a must have whenever we go for dim sum lunch. Best enjoyed with a pot of Chinese tea.Daily double boiled soup is tasty & many more delicious food from Wah Lok. When comes to dessert must end with the egg tart or egg custard tart which consists of an outer pastry crust that is filled with egg custard and baked
4
Wah Lok now has a nice refreshed decor and ambience after its renovation.Service is good, though most of the service staff speak Cantonese.I enjoyed the entrees of pan-fried scallop in golden sauce and the prawns in sugar cane stick and deep fried roll. The crabmeat beancurd and sweet corn was decent.The prawns and scallops in salt and pepper were delicious. The crabmeat egg white and dried scallops were excellent.The pork neck in black pepper was good. Both desserts were nice: soy beancurd with gingko and walnut, and black glutinous rice with ice cream
5
I have heard about this restaurant and have been wanting to visit for a while, and I definitely was not disappointed but was impressed with the service that was attentive and prompt. Food was indeed meeting expectations for the price. Definitely a place I will wanna go back to for good chinese fare! Well done to the staff
5
Delicious Chinese food. I tried the Winter melon soup that was served in the melon. Awesome taste and presentation. Sichuan spicy prawns was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Lobster noodles simple but good.
5
Always a pleasant to be here. Our favorite go-to place for dim sum. Bustling with business professionals having lunch breaks. Good service and yummy food. Thumbs up.
4
Book before hand on weekends. Two sitting 1130 to 1330 and 1330 to 1500 i think. Food are tasty, price is on the high side. A variety of selection, polite staff, individual tim sum range from 4.8 to 6.9 per basket.
5
Staff were very attentive and service was prompt.
Authentic Cantonese cuisine with exceptional service.
Steamed yam cake is a must try!
4
Wah Lok Restaurant in Carlton Hotel Bras Basah Road served delicious Tim Sum. Weekend are crowded and need booking . Price is on the high side though
4
We had a family birthday dinner at Wah Lok Restaurant at the request of a family member. It was my first time there although family and friends have dined there several times for dim sum and comments were positive. So I was keen to see if dinner lived up to the expectation. Well I wasn't disappointed. It exceeded my initial expectation in terms of taste and portion. We had Peking duck, ma po bean curd, diced beef and black bean prawns and scallops. The meat of the Peking duck was separately cooked with Yee Fu noodles (popular birthday tradition). The Peking duck skin was nicely cooked and crispy, sitting on a bed of prawn crackers. Ma Po bean curd dish was a good portion despite ordering a 'small' portion. The beef was tender and juicy. There was a good selection of Chinese desserts. We had mango pudding and sago.The deco is classy: grand-ish entrance as you walk along the hallway. Private rooms are at the side. I found the deco a bit cold but I guess it applies to most classy restaurants. It is a popular restaurant as the tables got filled up quickly at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. If you spend more than $200, parking at the hotel is complimentary. Upon paying the bill, I asked which credit card offered discounts. None did then but I was offered 10% off the food bill when I presented my Passion card. The food was reasonably priced. ( Promotion varies at different times of the year so please check on the day you dine).I have heard a lot about this classic restaurant and am glad to have tried it at long last. Would I return? Yes and I would have a go at dim sum the next time
3
This award-winning restaurant does not quite live up to all its accolades. Their dim sum and Peking duck are only average and their strong air-conditioning does not help by turning the good a tad too cold before we get to sample them all. The only thing I liked was the round dining hall with a high ceiling and nice chandelier, adding grandeur to the otherwise disappointing restaurant
4
This restaurant still produces a high standard of Yum Cha / Dim Sum offerings ad well as quality Cantonese Cuisine. Booking is essential even if you are a hotel guest for lunch. Ate there twice during our 3 night stay and was yearning for more if we could have stayed longer. Good food, good tea and great service makes it a satisfying experience
4
This restaurant has been around a long time. Renovated 5 years back along with the hotel. For our family dinner, we ordered a selection of roast meats, double boiled soups, vegetables and vermicelli. All are good. Desserts less so. Service is also better than expected , except for the front des
2
It was with great anticipation of returning to an old favourite that I arranged a birthday dinner there recently. However, we were greatly disappointed with the poor quality. At an average spend of $130 per pax, it was not exactly cheap and I regret not going to our favourite French restaurant instead. Both the quailty of the ingredients and the standard of cooking were lacking. Ingredient quality can't even compare to what we can get from the wet market which is really quite appalling. We are really sad that standards have plunged so much as this restaurant started off in the premium segment with prices getting lower over time but maintaining a good quality. We do not plan to return to this restaurant
4
Wah Lok is an established restaurant that serves good quality food. Their Dim Sum items are a must try.
4
I'm surprised with the ingenuity of this restaurant in treating common Chinese food to become special. The taste was pretty nice and serving was really making the food more appealing. Good service too !
4
Visited for a business lunch. Ordered a few dimsums - prawn, scallops, etc. All of them were excellent. Service was also very discreet but attentive.
4
Wah Lok is a Cantonese restaurant within a large hotel (the Carlton) which could give people pause. Even though the Carlton is not a mainstream hotel (being outside the main commercial and downtown belts), this is a surprisingly good restaurant. The dim sum is great as are the noodles and even the vegetable (we had broccoli florets with garlic). We even tried Peking duck (fried with noodles) and this is also recommended. Attentive service with a good maitre 'd. No corkage fees
4
I was very pleasantly surprised by the meal here. In full disclosure I was there with some locals who did the ordering for me and it was done perfect, every dish came out as a single course. If I was there by myself I wouldnt have done it so well. So I would suggest one seek assistance of the waitresses, who by the way are super helpful, and experience what this place has to offer the right way
5
Very good service, attentive, smiling but not rushing you. We had a fried squid that was excellent, some prawns, and a noodles soup probably the best I had already. I tried the Durien fried ice cream and a mango cream as desserts that were delicious. They have wide wines list
4
Featuring finely made Chinese Dim Sum dishes, Wah Lok is a strong player in the field of Dim Sum in Singapore! A tad bit expensive but the prices were definitely justified. Business executives frequent this joint and the restaurant features an executive set lunch menu too!
5
Very friendly staff with quick service. We were seated in a room with only one other table which, felt a bit weird as we could hear their every conversation (likewise they could hear ours) echoing in the room. Dim sum was fantastic, love their egg tarts and every other dish, fresh and nicely done. My friend recommended Wah Lok as we needed a kid friendly restaurant that serves decent food and I was not disappointed
4
We were recommended to Wah Lok as an upmarket Cantonese restaurant. We were not disappointed by the quality and quantity of the food! Excellent.However do not expect a relaxing meal: the service level is totally over the top to the extent that wait staff seemed to walk past the table at least every minute and either move something on the table, pour a small amount of wine or tea, anything they could do to disturb our peaceful enjoyable dining experience!We enjoyed the food but left the restaurant feeling exhausted and stressed after less than an hour. We had anticipated a delicious meal, but not so fast food.It was encouraging to see so many non "European" locals or visitors dining there - maybe this is what they expect
4
My family and I were staying at The Carlton Hotel and Wah Lok is just located at the second floor of the establishment. It was a good idea that we made reservations as the restaurant was full for the weekend lunch. We all liked the Char Siew Bo Luo Bao, Abalone Chicken Pie, Prawn Dumpling and the Din Tai Fung. For desert the Mango Pudding and Egg Tarts were great.Price is really reasonable. Service was good
5
Try the tim sum and the famous HK bun..
The tim sum is nearly match the taste in HK.
Enviroment is excellent. Service is excellent. All staffs are friendly...
Rm Mr James is the most friendly..
Must go
4
not really much of a different between crystal jade and imperial treasure. looks all about the same to me in terms of quality.
you will like it if you are into Cantonese food.
5
This is one of Singapores best restaurants and all the dishes we ordered were superb. I particularly loved the shrimp dumplings and the sweet pork baked bun.
5
We had one of the best dim sum in Singapore at Wah Lok. Went there with a group of 12 and really enjoyed the excellent quality of the dim sum. Wah Lok deserves its reputation as a top notch restaurant
4
We had dim sum at 1pm,and I loved the pineapple bun (with bbq pork), crabmeat dumplings, egg tarts, basically enjoyed most of the dishes! Including the desserts! Must order -mango,sago (yellow orange) cool dessert! Yum!
Average service but forgivable given the food was awesome!
4
Came here with six of us for early dinner, seated immediately without a reservation.
Very high quality food at reasonable prices, duck, octopus, soups were outstanding.
Service as it should be, attentive, timely and not pushy. Very helpful in recommending a couple of dishes.
5
Have been coming to Wah Lok every time I have been visiting Singapore and although the hotel has changed completely, the quality of the food here has remained excellent.We had dim sum with family and the staff were friendly and helpful.The variety on the menu excellent and the tastes perfect and delicious.The restaurant has consistently received awards for the quality and it is well deserved Make sure you book especially for lunch as it is a really popular place 
5
We don't frequent Chinese restaurants at home as the experience s have left a lot to be desired. The restaurant s decor is really lovely and staff very welcoming. As we weren't sure what to order our waiter Tonny made some suggestions which we gladly accepted. The food presentation and recommended dishes were an absolute feast. Our opinion of Chinese food has certainly altered after this experience
4
Recommended we try this restaurant for Baked Barbecued Pork buns and steamed carrot cake. Disappointed that they had run out of their signature dish the baked barbecued pork buns but had the steamed instead. Very happy with both meals and also had the prawn dumplings. Not a regular Chinese food eater these meals were delicious and I would recommend them to all. Also Chinese tea which cup was always filled. Only had a light lunch so you may need more to fill you up. And the carrot cake isn't a cake so be prepare

One word: outstanding food. For example, stirfry broccoli with crab meat is a classic simple Cantonese dish, but this is the first time I've seen people using big lumps of fresh crab meat - definitely not frozen ones. At S$38, not cheap, but the quality is superior. And that's pretty much the theme of the restaurant. Food was excellent and frankly for what they serve, it was quite reasonable. Our bill came to S$100 per pax with no alcohol, but then this included individual lobster noodle, crab meat broccoli, soy sauce cod fish fillet, dried scallop oyster stew, and crispy chicken, and double boiled soup

Possibly one of the better Cantonese restaurants outside of Hong Kong. All we had was Dimsum, and what we ordered really hit the spot.

Wah Lok has a solid reputation of a good Chinese Restaurant. Excellent service, with prices to match. The tim-sim at lunch time was fabulou.

Was here for Chinese New Year dinner. The alsaka king crab in our yu sheng is still frozen. The waitress even forgets to add in the pepper and spice to our yu sheng and is tongue tied when she should be saying auspicious chinese phases when adding the condiments to our yu sheng, I think I can say much better than her with my years of experience with Lao yu sheng. Lessons should be given to her in advance. The funny steamed fish from France (yes, it is not typo error. turbot fish from France), is hard and tasteless. Even the suckling pig can be no good. I always thought nothing can be wrong with BBQ suckling pig. It is extremely oily, and the meat is served attached. Thought only the skin should be served. Anyway, it still taste awful after me removing the meat on my own. What that we usually will finish in minutes was 50% unfinished. The sucking pig also do not come with pancakes to go with. This is a huge difference from last year when the whole pig was almost gone even before the waitress can bring us the accompanying pancakes. We had the set menu. Practically all dishes are 50% returned to the kitchen. The atmosphere, however, is the saving grace

You can really tell how good their Dim Sum is by the crowd; It is almost always full-house. The Dim Sum here are ordered by headcount (e.g. you can order 7 pieces of siew mai for a table of 7 guests) instead of per 'cage' as is the norm for most restaurants. Sure, it may be more expensive then most restaurants, but in this way, each of the guests get to have a proper serving while minimizing leftovers.The hargow (prawn dumpling), siewmai (a kind of pork dumpling), zhaleung (fried dough fritter wrapped in a rice sheet), and peidan juk (century egg porridge) are my personal favorites. The prawns used are fresh and carries a bounce with every bite. The lausabao (salted egg custard bun) filling though, isn't all that impressive, I've tried better ones elsewhere. Quality of the food is very good in my opinion. Service can be a bit slow though but that is probably due to the never ending stream of patrons. The age of the place shows, but adds to the charm of the restaurant, and did not negatively affect the meal in any way.Highly recommended if you want top-notch dim sum and if price is not an issue.Tip: Reserve a table at least a week ahead. The crowd is huge especially for breakfast/brunch/lunch timings

This is one of the few Chinese restaurants open for business during the Lunar New Year. We had lunch here and found the service rather friendly and tge food up to standard. The braised duck was tasty. But it was crowded. Last food order for lunch is at 2:15pm. If you want a table here it is better to call and reserve one
2
Some years ago, I used to dine at this restaurant as the standard of the food served was high.Since then, I have not visited, until recently. I was surprised to find that the food standard has deteriorated so badly. At the same time, the prices have increased and the serving portion reduced.I wonder what went wrong. Change of chef? Cutting corners?In any case, I will not ever visit this restaurant again
4
Went there for dinner, and have been there many times for lunch, location is convenient w City Hall MRT across the road. As it is considered Chinese winter decided to have the "lap Mei" rice which comes w Chinese sausages and waxed duck. This was good as the waxed duck was not salty except they chop it to too small a piece. Also had the recommended scallop , vegetable and dessert. Service was good, captain and waitresses attentive, will go back again. If driving you get complimentary parking ticket, pls ask the Captai

The atmosphere is beautiful and pretty quite. The food are wonderful, though pricey. The staff are very welcoming and warm. Attentive in taking orders and well versed with their menu, to recommend the platable dishes.Must try the abalone dish and also the wantan deep fried noodle with chicken. They are mouth watering.A good place to bring along your partner or family for a good feast
4
Went there for lunch on 27/12. The last visit was one year ago. Service was good - teapot water was replenished promptly even on a busy Sunday. Dim sum were excellent but not the highly recommended braised Ee-Fu seafood noodle which we found to be quite ordinary.
5
Having been here a few times, this restaurant made it to the top of my Singapore dim sum joints list. The dim sum is clearly a savouring delicacy, especially it's BBQ pork bun and it's siew mai. The ala carte menu was also good. If you are in the area, this place is certainly a must try for both locals and tourists alike. Remember to make a reservation as it would be severely packed especially during the lunch hours.
5
Have my lunch and dinner there today, the food are quite authentic compared to the Cantonese Restaurants in Hong Kong! Definitely is the best that I've ever tried on Si gapore for Cantonese food!
1
Just because it is popular , they dictate what time you have to arrive and what time you have to end your meal! Ridiculous! Food is not that great, price is not cheap and you have to rush through your meal!
5
Menu is extensive, lots of choice of appetisers, soups and mains. Food is so fresh and well presented. I would go as far as this is the best Cantonese food I've eaten anywhere. Recommended.
5
Good place for a dim sum gathering with family and friends. The steam carrot cake is still so good. Will continue to recommend.
5
Had a wonderful dim sum lunch here on a Saturday afternoon, food was excellent and staff service was exceptional. All the dim sum dishes were top notch and delicious, except for the Roast Pork dish which was horribly chewy and not crisp at all. Try the century egg porridge, it was particularly memorable and I enjoyed the rich ingredients that were in it.
5
I brought two business contacts from South Korea to Wah Lok for a dinner meeting, and we opted for a simple dinner set consisting of signature dishes such as the Shark Bone Soup and pan-fried cod fish. The food was very authentically Cantonese, and we particularly enjoyed the Shark Bone Soup, especially with its famed beautifying properties. I will definitely revisit
5
Had yum cha there on Sunday with 2 other people and let's just say we really enjoyed every thing we ordered. From the scallops, to the chicken feet, to the crazy good Baked BBQ Pork Bun, they are all to die for! We even ordered more BBQ Pork bun because it was way too good for us!Definitely would come back for more next time
1
We had a dinner with 10+ people and the restaurant did unfortunately not manage to serve more than 1 or 2 plates at the time for all of us. So imagine a huge rotary table with 2 small plates on it for more than 10 people. It is clearly a no go. The food as such was very good but would I go back? I guess not. There is so much more choice available in Singapore that I would chose an other restaurant next time
5
Whenever we are in Singapore we never fail to visit this restaurant mainly because the food they serve are always fresh and delicious! Although it's on the $$$ side, it's a must-visit for those looking for a value-for-money dining. So far, it has never disappointed me
5
Made reservations for lunch and was impressed with the service. Loved The food! The mix roast meat platter is a MUST TRY! Didn't manage to take many pics of the food because was too busy enjoying the food but highly recommend this place. Good service, good food, will be back!
5
Seafood is fresh, ribs are delicious. The service is good. Even red beans soup is good. Location is near to MRT station, overall it was a good place to host guest and gathering.
5
We heard that this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in town.
We went twice to this restaurant for dim sum. The food is excellent and especially their signature dishes. I love their deserts.
The service is excellent and the restaurant is nicely decorated.
4
The dim sum here is one of the best in Singapore. Prices are reasonable. Other dishes are also good. Service is good except during weekend where the traffic is heavy, service can be a little slow.
5
My son claims the Mango Chicken he had here is the best meal of his life! I had fish with veggies. Very good. Excellent service as well
5
Had an outstanding meal with my mother in this classy ever consistent restaurant. The prawn entree was artistically presented, the abalone delicious, and the smoked chicken very flavorsome. The walnut cream dessert somewhat disappointing. Service was pleasant and efficient. Highly recommended
5
This is a very popular destination for the locals, as the Chinese dishes are considered authentic without being overly gourmet. It has the atmosphere of a normal Chinese middle class restaurant -- open with large round tables.
4
Wah Lok used to be one of the top Cantonese restaurants in Singapore, right up there with Lei Garden. But I guess times have changed, and with the proliferation of good Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Wah Lok is now simply just very good. Not that the standard of their food has gone down, it's just that everyone else has upped their game. Service here is still excellent and the decor tasteful. Dim sum was good but you can get similar food and experience elsewhere for the same price
3
We've heard about this restaurant (especially the dim sum) for a long time, so wanted to give it a try. The best thing about Wah Lok is the attentive, friendly service staff. The dim sum is really nothing to write home about, there are many in Singapore that serve better versions of same or similar items. Other dishes in the Ã  la carte menu are good, but still not memorable enough
4
My family had lunch here recently. It was our first visit in some time since the hotel underwent renovations. We managed to get a table for five for the second sitting at 1.15pm on a Saturday. We were quickly ushered to our tables when we arrived and the food arrived relatively quickly. Their standout dish - the baked char siew bun - was as delicious as we had remembered it to be. However, we were disappointed to note that the bun had shrank in size. The buns were also sold out by about 1.45pm when we wanted to order second servings. Another nice dim sum dish was its xiao long bao with its fragrant stock. As for the remainder of the dim sum and main dishes, they were well-executed, although not particularly memorable. Do make prior reservations if you are planning to visit as it gets crowded on weekends and be sure to preorder their famous char siew buns to avoid disappointment.
5
This is our fav place for dim sum and my whole family love this place. A very good Cantonese dim sum and classy place which never fails your expectation. A definitely an experience to try their weekend dim sums (chicken feet, bo lo bun and xo carrot cake) and don't leave this restaurant without ordering mango sago pamelo dessert! Yummy!!
5
The decoration is elegant. The staff is well trained, attentive, efficient and eager to provide a good service. The food is excellent. I would recommend this place without hesitation.
4
Cantonese food here is good but i think they seem to also be a little generous on usage of MSG. We had the set dinner which had 6 dishes and provided for a nice hearty meal. Approx. S$200++ for 4 pax.
3
We were staying at The Carlton Hotel and decided on our last night to eat at Wah Lok. We were excited as we love Cantonese food but were left very dissapointed. There was a male member of staff who was most helpful and very attentive but other than that it was a let down.On the menu, there is the option of small, medium or large sizes for all of the main meals. We asked the waiter what size dishes we should order for 2 x adults. He recommended 2 x small dishes, we also ordered enough rice for 2 x people. We had both of our main meals gone before any rice arrived at our table! The rice arrived a good 15 minutes after the meat.The main dishes were also tiny so while waiting on the rice, we ordered 1 more main meal between us (as we were still hungry and we werent planning on eating dry rice by itself when it eventually arrived.I specifically asked twice that they hold off on sending the rice out until the additional main dish we ordered was ready but ofcourse the rice arrived over 5 minutes before the meat.The waitress would not leave our table alone, she was constantly standing over us either rearranging cultery or our plates as we ate, which there was no need to do. The restaurant was also very cold and we felt so rushed, we were in and out in less than an hour!Having been so excited about the meal, i was left really unimpressed. There are so many lovely retaurants in Singapore, i wish i didn't waste one of my nights in this place
5
Nice atmosphere , Great smells that lure you in , theres always plenty of freshly prepared food and a massive selection , the staff are very nice and helpful and so are the chefs , they really want you to enjoy your meal and will do anything they can , even if its not on the menu
4
This restaurant was recommended to us for its award winning Cantonese food. It didn't disappoint. What hadn't been mentioned was how good the service is. One of us is vegetarian, and was able to order off menu. The maitre d' (Tommy) was really accommodating, going back and forth to the kitchen to check with the chef what might be possible. All food was freshly prepared and served piping hot. I will certainly return
5
First time here and it exceeded my expectations in all areas!Menu was pretty extensive, so be prepared to spend bit of time looking through all the yummy food lists, and cracking your food what to order. We had the set for 4, which comes with abalones, oysters, say sauce chicken and sharks fin soup. All are of high quality and never fail to impress. Service is prompt, genuine and friendly. Staffs took their time to introduce their signature dishes, and explaining some of the menu items which we are unsure of.Will definitely come back here again for more
4
The restaurant is set in a good sized space and the service was good (given that Chinese dim sum service can be average at best). The menu was adequate and the quality of the food was not too bad. We ordered quite a number of dim sum dishes (various prawn dumplings, chicken feet, vegetable dumplings, beef and dough rolls etc) as well as noodles, fried rice and Peking duck. None of the dishes stood out as a must order but none also were a major disappointment. I would come back here again.
4
Went with a group. Menu was large, expensive and varied. Like most places in Singapore the wines were crazy prices, all over $100 and of average quality. The service was zany with the waiter singing and announcing food with ta ta dum style exclamations. The food was nice Chinese food but no better than cheaper establishments. Costs were over SGD$100 each without dessert.
5
I've been here about 3 times but only thought of reviewing it now :)The most recent visit was 15th Feb 2015, the Sunday before Chinese New Year, so you could imagine how crowded it was. Went for a dim sum lunch with 5 other adults. We got a table promptly at 1230pm, which was our reservation time. It was packed with families having reunion dim sum lunches like us :)Was impressed that the food quality remained as good as on my previous visits (less crowded). A few highlights were the carrot cake, the pork chee cheong fun, the egg custard buns and their congee! I've tried both the century egg + pork congee and the pork congee and would recommend the pork congee. There is a suitable amount of pork and the congee just slides down your throat! (Ok, my stomach is literally growling as I type this review!) Service staff remained polite and composed despite having to be everywhere at once.Conveniently located opposite Raffles City Shopping Centre, CHIJMES and the Raffles Hotel, it's a stone's throw from the City Hall MRT station and a number of tourist attractions. Remember to make table reservations, especially on weekends! The food and service is worth every cent! So even with a slighter steeper price tag, if anyone asks me for a recommendation for dim sum, I won't hesitate to say Wah Lok! Bon appetit
5
The very best of chinese anywhere in the world! We live in London where we have some of the best chinese restaurants, but this......Peking duck and home made pancakes melt in the mouth, crisp and after the crispy skin in pancakes the duck meat will be served in any way you like. Don't miss the black pepper beef, it is outstanding and all the rest. We went back three times! We would go back to Singapore just for eating in this wonderful restaurant. The dim sum blows you away!! But you must book for the dim sum lunch as it's very popular with the Singaporeans! And they know a thing or two about food!
4
I regularly meet local friends for lunch or dinner at Wah Lok when I am passing through Singapore. It can always be relied upon to provide quality food and service.
5
Has been eating Tim Sum here for a few years whenever I visit Singapore. Glad to say the quality is still good especially the Har Gao and Fried Carrot cakes. Have not tried the dinner menu but will do so next visit.
4
Good dim sum lunch. Quality for money. Would visit again someday in the future. Ambience was a little noisy but expected.
4
Since I first ate at this restaurant more than 20 years ago, the taste is always good and reasonablly priced.
5
I asked my Singapore hosts to take me somewhere where I could enjoy a top quality Peking Duck and they didn't let me down.
Top quality restaurant, very professional service, everything was done really well and couldn't fault the whole operation.
4
Haven't been here for 10 years and got a chance to return. Had a dim sum lunch and ordered the usual favorites - XO carrot cake, chicken feet, xiaolongbao, roast pork bun etc. They were all pretty good. The roast platter surprisingly doesn't have roast pork belly , and the roast pork meat wasn't very goodWas deciding on what noodles to order and was recommended noodles with crab roe that was off the menu. Only realised when the bill came that it was a whopping $30 per small bowl, and each of us had 1. Probably trying to increase profit margin per table, not great if you want return customersOverall service was fine except for the incident above. Probably won't return unless invited as there are too many better restaurants in singapor
4
Went there for lunch dim sum with friends. Restaurant is big and spacious. The cha siew bun, steam carrot cake, har gao, Xiao long bao were all very good. The custard bun was a slight disappointment as it got cold very fast. Overall the quality of the food was good. Service was excellent as well.Tip: Go early even for lunch as they only prepare limited quantities for certain items. Went a little late and tried to order another serving of the Xiao long bao and it was sold out. Do a reservation as well
3
Just had a weekday dim sum lunch at this so-called famous cantonese restaurant. I said "so-called" because i've never heard of them until my friend suggested to meet there. Anyway, i went in with no expectations. We tried the usual dishes including siew mai, char siew bun, char siew chee cheong fun and century egg porridge. Most of the food was bland! Our request for pepper (to go with the porridge) was met with weird stares. Chee cheong fun was abit dry. Char siew bun was the best tasting dish we had.Custard bun and egg tarts were very good though. Ambience was classy which suited the majority business-attired diners. Will give them another chance and perhaps try the dinner next time
4
Spacious and you do not have dim sum trolley knocking pass you or those hectic and tight table spaces around you. Love the calm and easy atmosphere. No waiters will chase you for settling the bill. Easy to rock up and ask for table for 2. Loved the suckling pig dish.
5
I stay at Carlton all the time during my business trip, and I always go to Wah Lok for dinner when I miss the Cantonese food. The food is authentic. The staff is all very friendly and helpful. Please try their pineapple sweet & sour pork, which is awesome. I travel by myself, and this place offers dishes in small or big portion, so that I am able to order / try more than one dish. The pricing is very reasonable at this quality and in a hotel. This place is highly recommended
5
the vegitarian selection is tasty.. we really enjoyed this special dinner and will return when next in Singapore
5
Had my department dinner there for CNY earlier this year. The food was amazingly good! : ) Will probably visit again with my family...
5
Totally different to Chinese restaurants as we Aussies know them it would be better if you dines with a local who you how to order the local way.
One caution wine very expensive a bottle of Grant Burge white S$98
5
It is amazing how this 30 year old restaurant continues to maintain itself as one of the top Chinese restaurant in the ultra competitive restaurant scene in Singapore. I attribute that to the simple formula of continue interest and innovation in the art of Chinese cooking, stick to best quality produce and their come from the heart service. They continue to offer one of the best Cantonese dishes and pleasant no nonsense dinning experience. Ambient is relax and classy suitable for both casual and business dinning. An enjoyable meal can range from affordable to very expensive if one choose to go for the ultimate gastronomy experience. Keep it up Wah Lok

Came here for my mother's birthday celebration.Stared off with crab and egg white fried rice as the kids were hungry and couldn't wait. They finished off a 4-person portion and asked for more, so we ordered another small portion. There was some left over for me to try, and it was very nice. Just the right moistness and good flavours and very generous portion of crab.Of course there was the mandatory birthday buns. Lotus paste inside was smooth and good consistency, but because I don't quite like floury things, I felt that the skin was a bit too thick, though there may be some who like it.Had 3 different types of soup for different people, but I got to try all 3 as my daughter and son could not finish their portions. Mine was the carrot soup with crab dumpling. Exquisite. Carrot soup was again full of flavour and good consistency. The very large dumpling had just the right texture and was filled with crab meat and other stuff. The sweet corn and chicken soup (which is my favourite soup) was tasty, and the "lai tong" (daily soup) of lotus root was also full of flavour.Next was their signature cod fish in some sweet sauce (miso?). Flacky and cooked just right. Yummies! Also tried the signature pork ribs, and did they melt in the mouth. Also had generous portion of fattyness, which I loved (but the health-conscious may trim that, poor things !)Ended off with the prawn with fish noodles. Texture needs getting used to, but I also liked it a lot. Overall, very good flavours, but the dinner for 6 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 kids came to $700+ which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5
5
This restaurant is highly recommended by a friend of mine who lives in Singapore. The restaurant is within walking distance from my hotel. The servers could speak Cantonese (and of course Mandarin being in Singapore). This is a Cantonese restaurant. As Cantonese food is not spicy, it's very easy to tell how fresh the seafood is. We ordered lobster and fish (both steamed). I can tell immediately that the seafood was very fresh. This is not some cheap restaurant, but the quality of the food is worth every dime of it. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Singapore. My only regret was the food was sooooo yummy that I forgot to take pictures of them. Oh well..

My husband and I organised a 80th Birthday celebration dinner for my father-in-law last Saturday. After evaluating the menus of a few restaurants, we settled on Wah Lok as it had a private room for 30 people and offered varied menus with interesting dishes. We managed to book the room and even though we had slightly less than 30 guests, they graciously accommodated us. I chose the Gourmet Menu for $1,088++ per head. The dishes were of sizeable portions and beautifully presented. Best of all, they tasted great. The suckling pig was particularly impressive and surprisingly, the table where all the elderly sat managed to finish the whole thing, meat and all, whereas the younger ones like us were too concerned with our waistlines to do so! The service was good too with all the dishes being served in individual portions and enough service staff to service the 3 tables (and were good natured as well), frequent change of plates and topping up of tea etc. All in all, we had a very good experience and satisfying meal. Even though the meal costs us more than $3,000 in total, it was well worth it and I will not hesitate recommending others to go to this restaurant again
3
We went to Wah Lok for my dad's 79th birthday lunch. We ordered dim sum from the menu. The cheong fun with shrimp was delicious! The rest of the dim sum was just ok. I don't mind the pricing and when in Singapore, when almost everything revolves around food, OK dim sum won't cut it for me. I wished the selection included pork belly. It did not. The service was impeccable
3
I went here with a business colleague for a light dinner. None of the food was exceptional. The ribs were nice. For over $70 a person, I would expect a restaurant to a least try for excellence. However, there was an obvious lack of passion and everything was just average. They do not even bother to have fresh beer on tap (cans only).There was a lot of staff on hand, and they were a happy lot, so service was prompt. But the staff was not smiling nor did they didnt make me feel particularly welcomed
4
We went there with 20 colleagues for a business diner and we had our own room set with two tables. In brief we had a superb dinner and I would gave them another half star if I could.The menu has been selected in advance and we had nearly 10 different dishes that were served in a timely manner. Most of them were very good and a few were great. I have fond memories of a roasted pig with a crispy skin nicely flavored, a big fried scallop and mushrooms on a bed of spinach.It is not easy to serve 20 people but the service was flawless, not too slow, not too fast.I've no idea how expensive it was but I'll come back any time
4
Have not been back for many years and was not disappointed. Food quality is exquisite and so is the service. Their soup reminds me of Hong Kong. We also had smoked chicken with a few other dishes and finished off with 'lap mei fan'.
4
Staying in the Carlton Hotel in Singapore and found out they have an award winning Cantonese restaurant so decided to try it out for dinner yesterday the 1st day of Chinese Lunar New Year. As not very hungry decided to order small dishes.Service is as expected hotel standard with attentive staff and knowledgeable staff in Cantonese cuisine. The highlight of the meal for two is the Yu Sheng which is a salad dish for good luck, this dish is invented in Singapore so it is very local. The other special is the sea cucumber and this is the first time I have it stuffed with minced pork, simply delicious and well executed
5
Having eaten at numerous dim sum places over the years, Wah Lok is still one of the top dim sum places I've tried so far. There is a good variety of dishes to choose from, and the taste is simply mouth-watering. The staff are generally polite, and efficient. Definitely a thumb's up
5
I have been going to Wah Lok for years and it has never once disappointed me. Went there again with some friends from the US and they loved it! We were there on 28th December for lunch, the place was packed. Reservations are needed but i couldn't get through the phone, very lucky to snag a table last minute. Ordered the century egg lean meat porridge, siew mai (the only siew mai I'd eat as most are too 'porky'), har kao, 'liu sha bao' (A MUST!), Peking Duck(done both ways - rolled in crepe skin and fried with noodles), carrot cake, siew long bao and dessert. All were great!! What my friends and I love is that after the meal, you don't get that greasy after taste of dim sums (which most places do) or feel indigestion. Fast and efficient service, the supervisors are great

Celebrated wedding anniversary here. This was actually my first visit to the restaurant. Had heard a lot about it. Had craving for claypot rice, so decided to call up to make reservations and preorder to settle the menu.Chef did not disappoint with the claypot chicken rice served with Chinese sausages and mushrooms. The dish was good. Quantity was actually sufficient for 3 to 4. IA bit too gently, but elegantly, done. gathered that it was not cooked with charcoal fire in the pot. There was still a lightly charred layer at the bottom, which was lifted up nicely for us when I requested for it. The meal started with a traditional soup. 珍珠豆煲排骨 I liked it. Traditional 老火汤, superbly done.Next was braised cod served with broccoli. Fish was fresh and tender, with the sauce and flavour penerating well into the flesh. This was followed by spinach cooked with sea cucumber and mushrooms. Good quantity of vegetables too. The meal ended with dessert that was a mixture of sesame seed paste and walnut paste 芝麻糊合桃糊双拼. Not sure if this and the claypot rice were routinely in their menu, as I specifically requested for these over the phone. For this meal, I did not look at the menu and just got it assembled over the phone. I must say that the staff who took my order was knowledgable, helpful and responsive. My wife likes yam pot, which they did not serve. I later realised that this was not exactly a Cantonese dish. Good that the restaurant stuck to authentic Cantonese cuisine. However, I was a little surprised they did not have roast pork too! Because the serving of claypot rice was quite large, we agreed to keep the menu to 5 items including dessert. Generally the service was excellent. Just a little hasty at the beginning. The sea cucumber dish was served before I finished the cod. I had to tell them to slow down. Ambience was not too bad, except they did not have a small table at a cosy corner. I did stat that I was celebrating my wedding anniversary. So compared to Summer Palace where they set us at a corner table last year, with only a slight mention one the phone while booking and ordering, and decorated the table with rose petals, Wah Lok lost a few points.Good experience overall. For the quality of the food, I think the pricing is actually quite reasonable. One must acknowledge that it would not be cheap for this class of restaurant. In summary, I would recommend restaurant highly for quality Cantonese food
4
We were staying in the Carlton Hotel and one night we were tired and decided to try the Wah Lok rather than going out. Service was very good, the menu certainly had something for everyone and the restaurant was very clean, airy and well laid out. Unfortunately, my lasting memory will be the of the waiter informing me that I was eating the sauce for my wife's main course as my hot and sour soup had not yet been served. It's just a different way of doing things - we live and learn
3
Food is great, it is typically Chinese. It is better for lunch as atmosphere is as cold as the temperature, it is freezing cold because of aircon so be aware of it. I was not really impressed. Staff are efficient but I did not see a real smile. Overall a mixed feeling: Good Food, No atmosphere and totally frozen
4
I have now eaten there twice as the food is excellent. We had the Red Grouper, Kampong and crispy chicken. I especially like the fried Octopus as a starter.Surprisingly, it is also not an expensive restaurant even though it has won a few awards.It gets very busy in the evening and thus it is a bit noisy at times. Personally, I find the staff a bit too attentive and I felt rushed each time I ate there
5
We had to wait a little while to get at a table on a busy Saturday afternoon. However once we got in and were seated the whole experience was great, the Dim Sum was excellent and I would go out on a limb to say its the best. The dishes were super, quality excellent, the service was equally matched all up EXCLLEN
1
I decided to try the Dim Sum after hearing the good reviews from a friend.I have to conclude that my friend probably hasn't had Dim Sum in the longest time or he must've been starving for a period of time.The Dim Sum served is what you would get in a Coffeeshop in Geylang.And that would probably even taste better. For a 5 star restaurant the food is below par... For a renowned Chinese restaurant serving Cantonese cuisine,the Dim Sum is atrocious.I will never set foot here again. The only commendable fact is that the staff are genuine and friendly.But it's the food I' care about not anything else
4
I came with work mates and had a beautiful night out. Food and service terrific. Loved the duck, the specially pre ordered claypot rice and other great dishes.
4
Went with whole family for dinner. Disappointed that they cannot keep up to their usual quality of their food. Must definitely look into this aspect no matter how many guests are around.
4
The newly renovated Wah Lok has been a good place to come back to for dim sum lunch with the family. Food has kept to the high standards and the service was attentive and good.
4
Nice ambience, love d porriage + steam carrotcake... & also d avacardo cream witl icecream topping...oohs soooo yummy!!
Will go again

Egg Tarts are a must try. Ask waitress to have it made hot! Dim Sum hours are only from 1130hrs to 1430hrs so do arrive early or the egg tarts will be sold out. Another must try is their popular Buo Luo Bao that while baked, still retains the softness of the bread dough. Great for those with sweet tooth

After reading great things was thoroughly disappointed. Would rather spend $4 in a hawker market than almost $100 here. Arrived around 9pm and felt very unwelcome. Other tables were being set for breakfast and would rather had been told the kitchen was closed. Before having a chance to read the menu we were asked 3 times to order and were offered house wine by the glass rather than being shown a wine menu. I ordered the smoked duck to start the the pork ribs while my wife went with the smoked duck then then scallops. The scallops arrived first followed by the duck then rice then ribs. It felt like they brought it out when cooked rather than I the correct order to enjoy. The duck was great and the salt and pepper ribs, rather than being whole ribs were cut into small pieces about 1.5cm square and then fried. After eating a couple they were fine but the third had a sharp bone in that cut my gum. Assuming this was a one off I are another only to to f a larger bone which spoiled the whole meal. I understand thAt whole ribs are On the bone but having to debone small pieces and having sharp shards of bone, I do not find acceptable at all, let alone at this price. When I complained I was told it is supposed to be like this and should have ordered something else.Most disappointing meal out in a very long time and most disappointing g 5* meal ever. I don't know if they just didn't like me or just couldn't be bothered but regret goin

Went for yumcha with my family of 6 for my mother's birthday, and we were very pleased with everything! We were seated quickly (first sitting at 11am) and despite the very busy restaurant, there were plenty of waitstaff around and they did things quickly and efficiently (rare for Singapore standards!)The food arrived quickly and we though each one was lovely - from the delicate and juicy xiao long bao, to the fresh shrimp dumplings and roasted pork buns. Not the best yumcha I've ever had, but definitely very tasty! They also refrigerated and brought out my mum's birthday cake for us, with no complaints at all. All in all, a very enjoyable meal in a wonderfully refined setting

Came for dim sum with a few friends and to be honest preferred the food at the dim sum joints back in Australia where I now live!Not sure if the problem is my taste in dim sum or the dim sum itself!Restaurant is quite formal as far as Cantonese places go, although relaxed enough for young kids/babies to have a place

i work in an industry where dining is 2nd nature. but most times meals cannot be planned and are impromptu . so ive been turned down 3 times in my last 5 attempts to book for a table with no prior planning at Wah Lok carlton. if thats not a clear indication of the demand for the great food then ....... dim sums notonli tatse good , they look good . honestly i didnt have that much of a good look at them , i just wolfed them ! so dun get angry , be patient ! and go hungry

I been to this restaurant few times over the years. Every time when I visited Wah Lok, the food never fail me. Recently, I tried the lobster mee sua, a soupy version, the mee sua was fantastic, not soggy or starchy after half an hour. The gravy is of superior stock with moderate hua tia wine. The lobster was a bit of small portion but taste excellent. One portion was S$28, a bit pricy but worth trying. I have also ordered crab cook in white pepper and white onion. It was good, crab not overbooked, the ingredients sufficiently proportionate. The crab meat fresh juicy and meaty. The only problem was that it was always crowded in the evening and on Sunday morning

Dim sum here is this best. But need to make reservations. They only accept 11am and 1pm reservations.

Due to renovation at Carlton Hotel, restaurant operation has been moved into Ballrooms. Dim Sum is no being served during this period.
5
Reminded me of one of those opulent dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. Large selection of items and not too pricy given the ambience.

It was like being in Beijing for the quality of the food

Before I start my review, I would like to commend a short-hair female staff named Siew Chin, for her excellent service and impeccable attention to the table. It was rare chance to be served by such a warm and lively lady who always carried a smile on her face and everyone was impressed with the service even though we did not feedback to the management. For full review : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/01/wah-lok-at-carlton.htmlWe were there to have a family dinner and tried some alacarte dishes. I am not a keen fan of expensive ingredients and thus I cannot comment on the taste of some food but those who had them enjoyed the delicacies.Mee Sua with Crab in Huatiao Stock ($12) was originally with Mee Sua with Lobster($22) but with opted for crabs since they were cheaper and the stock base remains the same. This was surprisingly simple but flavorful and mildly sweet. It was highly recommended by the staff and now by me because it is a nice change from the usual Yi Mian or fried noodles/rice.Hokkaido Scallops in Golden Sauce was better than the fish. The scallop was undeniably meaty and cooked to right doneness but the thin layer of fried flour batter wrapping the scallop was unnecessary.There were abalone, oysters, sharkfin and other dishes.

It was a typical family lunch of Aunts and Uncles for Christmas Eve's Day dimsum, and one of the large tables at the Wah Lok restaurant in the Carlton Hotel served rather well as a venue for such a gathering.Wah Lok is a fairly large restaurant but has it various areas or zones, and on this occasion our table was located in the more salubrious round section with high ceilings and chandeliers as it were.Food was typical dimsum but of tasty and good quality and some of the specific special dishes separate to the regular dimsum offerings were served well eg the dofu with spinach or the steamed lorbak. Service was of the usual efficiency one expects and gets in Singapore, with waitresses rushing around with their direct telephone/walkie talkie links so as to allow them direct access and expediency in reaching or communicating with the kitchen.Everyone seemed pleased also with the environs and it was a pleasant lunch to mark the end of the year

I have frequented Wah Lok at Level 2, Carlton Hotel for some time now. I love their soup of the day as well as their deep fried cod fish in light sauce ($56 for a large portion). My family of 5 always orders a large pot of soup so that there is more than enough to go round.The mango with crispy chicken also comes with a roasted duck version but the roast duck does not really go with the orange sauce as well as the crispy chicken.Visit Wah Lok for authentic cantonese food cooked the traditional way.The dessert section needs a revamp and the sweet and sour pork is cooked too much like tai-pie-tong (coffee shop) style. Perhaps they can consider including some berries to add more flavor to that dish.I understand the restaurant will be undergoing some renovation so some of the live seafood dishes may not be available under renovation wraps up in October 2012

Service with a smile goes a long way with me, and that is what you get at Wah Lok. On top of this, you get pretty good Cantonese food. Having lived in Asia for a long time, I tend to avoid Cantonese food as it seems to be the kind I was brought up on (even though usually not authentic) in Australia. Wah Lok was a nice re-introduction to the cuisine. They serve, what I remember to be, Cantonese standard fare, but it is done very well. The crab and corn soup was sweet, and yet the corn did not overpower the crab. We also had a lemon chicken dish that highlighted the sweet and sour in a very elegant and delicious sauce. Finally, we ordered a tofu dish with broccoli: it was superb. Yes, the tofu, actually had taste (mainly from the sauce) and the broccoli was still a little toothsome, making it a nice contrast to the soft tofu.I was glad that I chose Wah Lok as my return to Cantonese cusine

While staying at the Carlton, do try this resturant!!WHen I went there I was not sure what I wanted, so the waitress did a great job of asking what my likes were and then suggested very good menu items. I will definitly go back there even if I do not stay at the hotel

My parents love the Dim Sum at Wah Lok. They will patronise the restaurant whenever they are in Singapore. Reservation is required to confirm a table because it's always full during weekend.The Dim Sum are good and price is reasonable. A must visit place when my parents are in town

This restaurant is almongst one of the good place to have your dim sum. But you need to make table reservation in advance especially for weekends.Choices of dim sum are good and delicious, and I like their porridge and egg tart. You will not be disappointed.Hotel location is easily accessible and central, and car parking no issue even on weekends. Restaurant layout and decoration is very nice and pleasing

Cantonese food has delicate flavors and the food at Wah Lok fits the bill. I had the Wasabi Prawns (delicate ... not spicy as you might think)., Black Pepper Beef (Flavorful but not spicy) and a steamed whole fish (very delicate) and a tapioca pudding dessert. My host had the Durian ice cream special ... an acquired taste.Service was excellent and the atmosphere elegant and quiet

This is the most child-friendly, classy yum-cha restaurant I have been to. We took about 5 toddlers there, and they all got baby-seats. Very good service complementing the standard dimsum fare which is of high quality and fresh. Recommend making a booking.
