This is the famous rojak store at the food centre. You will need to take a number and come back again. The price is reasonable and you can choose specific ingredients.

For $4 you get a larger than average portion with cuttlefish. Most rojak at $4 doesn't have cuttlefish. Very nice taste.

It was a large portion of rojak, visited because of the high rating but taste wise is okay. Would prefer the one at Wisma Atria Food Republic much better, however that was more pricy.

You can tell that this gentlemen put his heart and soul into making this dish when you are there waiting for your number to be call. Everything is done just right, from the amount of sugar, to the peanuts being added and how crispy the fried dough and cuttlefish are. The whole dish is mixed up very well, so they are crunchy, tasty unlike some others places

Rojak was good..a lot of ingredients and not so sweet as well. Funny tho that they don't have taupok in the rojak..But the fried dough was crispy on the outside and soft inside. We added on dried cuttlefish and century egg which made it nicer too..

This was the first time I saw a deli style ticket for ordering at a Hawker. After taking my ticket and waiting about 20 minutes, I finally ordered my rojak. Each rojak is made to order by the tag team couple. The man setups the bowls and the women creates the perfect sauce from her 6 bins. Another 5 minutes later, I was enjoying some of the best rojak Singapore has to offer. Great balance of sweet and spiciness with the right amount of sauce (which is to say just barely overflowing). Totally worth coming to Old Airport road hawker for this. Note: next to this stand is some great beancurd â€“ get that for dessert

This place still retains this wonderful old rojak tastes as the good old days. I love this flavour.However, currently the rojak is no longer made by the lovely old couple. Now its done by the son, i think. And it som how just seems lacking.... but only marginally..
