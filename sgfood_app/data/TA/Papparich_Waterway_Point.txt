Good is authentic and great even for the price, services can be further improved, waiters/waitress don't really bother to speak, for example they'd just point at the order paper when asked.

Great restaurant. The menus is endlessly full of all type of dishes for every taste.The ordering system is original and easy.The service efficient and the serving size just right.I had curry Laksa a Malaysian dishes like a very reach soup named by the huffy and puffy post one of the 10 dishes you must try before you die.Not for the faint of taste. Extremely tasty and spicy hot.Great experience. They have a restaurant in L.A. and new York and other place in the world.Just try it you won't be disappointed.

My Wife and I went here for dinner. She ordered char kuay Teow and I ordered the curry lamb. I must say both were superb but I like the lamb more. Price is fairly reasonable. Verdict: leaves a good after taste. If you don't mind giving yourself a treat, go for it and later give yourself a pat on the back for making the right decision.

This is my first time visiting Papparich and was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome and sunny smiles from the service staff. The 1st staff promptly and patiently showed me how to place my order. In the remarks column, I indicated, 'spicy' and was served with both red chillies and chilli sauce. How thoughtful! The noodles was abit dry but the prawns were good sized. The dish overall was worth the amount paid.  Halfway through lunch, another staff asked if she could serve me anything else. That was a good customer service! At the end of the meal, another staff politely asked if he could clear the plate. I was still sipping my lemon drink and prefer my table to be cleared so I welcomed his promptness! I also observed the same welcoming attitude to other diners as well. I had a simple meal but was bowled over by the exceptional customer service at this restaurant. Thank you to the management and to the staff of Papparich for the good customer service

Live up to their expectations of having good food and pretty reasonable restaurant price. I was at Plaza Singapura's outlet and I think the standards are pretty much the same.I still think their desserts are very well done, and would recommend the cendol and/or the egg pudding
