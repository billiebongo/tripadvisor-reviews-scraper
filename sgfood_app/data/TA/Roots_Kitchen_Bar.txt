We weren't expecting much but the food was delicious, the service attentive and the decor well thought out. We will be back soon!

Few disappointing moments:1. Firstly they have changed their concept to serve only finger food. However, the price of the menu doesn't reflect so.2. Ordered squid ink pasta, only to know there's no squid but just squid ink plain pasta.3. Ordered 3 other pizza. Seafood deluxe is one and we didn't even know it actually arrived because I just couldn't see any seafood4. The pizzas are poorly cooked. All toppings fall off before you even get to eat it.5. Most disappointing is I couldn't use my 1-1 Entertainer deal. Happy to pay if the food is at least good, but the experience above explains it was an awful visit and I don't think we will ever visit again

The food is unique and unlike other cafes! We had the sweet potato fries, squid ink truffle pasta and the London broil. The London broil was slightly overcooked and too salty. The pasta was heavenly but probably too big a portion for one to have as a main cause it's too "jelat". Wanted to try the pork collar but it was sold out by the time we got there
4
I went there with a bunch of friends.We loved the food. Service was friendly and goodThe linguine in squid ink wit ha poached egg are definitely a must try.Corkage was a bit high at 20 dollars (we brought wine) but hey, everybody needs to make a living ;)I will come back with the wife so that she can try the food there

After reading all the reviews and staying just a KM away at Farrer park, went with my wife a 10yr old daughter at 10PM after a day out sightseeing in Singapore with hope a nice dinner. When I entered and took a table the waitress told no dinner only drinks. I told my kid is hungry and see if you can serve something , she asked the men siting just behind me probably the owner's cum aka chefs and they nodded their heads "No" They probably took me as a low spender due to my race? Finally when I got up to leave I asked If I could buy a bottle of water as we were exhausted from the busy day the lady told they don't have water. Now this hurt me a lot. I did want to come back the next day to try their food but not being served water (to buy) not worth the effort
5
Visited roots kitchen bar with my family with three young kids for a dinner. We took awhile to find the place but once we arrived, we were met with great service. The food served had nice presentation and fabulous taste. The kids were screaming for seconds right after they finish their portions. Strongly recommended. Have made another reservation to go back with a bigger group next week.
3
We popped in for a late dinner on a Wednesday night. The pork was a little under cooked - in that it could have been a bit more fall apart tender. But the rest of the meal and the service was good
5
Roots is a lovely space, quiet enough for good conversation, but not awkwardly so. Food was tasty and menu is obviously well-thought through - loved the ocean crab pasta and sweet potato fries. Another cool thing about this place is that prices are nett (no GST and service charge) and super reasonable for the quality of food that we got.
3
The ambience is great. But getting there was a bit hard as the cafe wasn't easy to locate at all. While the truffle egg is delicious, the pulled pork was salty in every aspect. From the egg to the mushrooms even to the salad. Hope they cut down on the salt usage
5
I loved this place! Right beside my design hotel in Little India and way way way better than the restaurant in the hotel! Staff extremely nice, food really good and well presented. Though within this area it looks like a little bit "out", I was really glad I've found it right there! I'll be back
5
Stumbled upon this restaurant and enjoyed my first dining experience here thoroughly. Returned with family, and had a wonderful lunch too.
4
Great food and drinks. Will be back to try other dishes soon. Place was quiet to come a conversation too.
5
Went there for lunch after read all the encouraging reviews. Tried smoke duck salad, loaded sweet potato, Seabass & steak etc.. all taste awesome. Service is execellent, shall certainly go again.
5
Went because reviews good, and search showed they had craft beer. The craft beer is CRAP - CAPITAL LETTERS - CRAP!!! Not brewed, was a commercial multinational style with a chemical laden taste. Suggestion to management - dump the Norway made CRAP and import Brewdog or similar.The food was the highlight.Had salmon entree (sensational), and mushroom soup (best we've ever had in over 30 nations).Followed with the Sea Bass. the fish was perfect, the accompanying items need replacing. The prawns were flavourless and the clamari pointless. Did like the celery. So, Mr Chef, ditch the prawns and calamari, replace them with other complimentary vegetables such as parsnip or sweet potato and fresh (mung) bean sprouts. Ideally, the base for the fish should compliment (rather than contrast) and be bright and 'alive'.The (only) red by the glass was merlot, and very good.The desert of mouse was delightful, but 3 scoops too much, 2 would scoops adequate
4
Food is awesome especially the London Broil, perfectly cooked to what we wanted.The service is pleasant though slow.

One of the best thing at Roots Kitchen & Bar is their menu. Featuring sumptuous dishes starting with some brunch food to starters and side shares followed by mains and desserts all at pocket friendly NETT prices! This has definitely set them apart from the typical more costly European Restaurants.Egg & Truffle Mousseline topped with Cavier ($4). Smooth egg mousseline served in cute egg shell on a primitive egg carton brings our memories back to the good olden days for a split moment. It has a mashed potatoes alike kind of sandy mouthfeel and lingering traces of truffle with a blend of earthy taste from the mushrooms.Loaded Sweet Potatoes Fries ($15) with truckloads of feta cheese, jalapenos and minced meat! A slight twist made to the usual crispy sweet potatoes fries was the melty cheese and exploding surprises in its flavors. A little sweetness from the sweet potato with a hint of kick from the jalapenos.Ocean Crab Pasta ($18). Fine thread like pasta tossed and coated with rich umami flavored lobster bisque was served with generous servings of fresh shredded crabmeat. The pasta was cooked right to perfection with each thread sealed with the flavor of the sea. Definitely a like for seafood lover!Nagano Pork Rack (200g, $27) revealing a refreshing compote of pickle sweet braised cabbage, mustard seed and grape that brightens the flavors of the pork rack. The pork rack with a pinkish center is tenderly soft and easy to swallow. One of the better pork rack in town i would say!London Broil ($22). Flank steak done medium with a slight chewiness to it. Accompanied by red wine jus, smooth potato puree and some root vegetables! Flavors of different food has complimented well all within this one dish.It was definitely a hearty dinner with such lip smacking delicious dishes and such good food has definitely been made more accessible with the new Rochor Mrt Station
4
My wife and I were at the Roots Kitchen Bar for a nice and romantic dinner. I ordered the pork while my wife ordered the seabass. Both dishes were delicious and i liked the sauce that comes with the pork. We also enjoyed the banana cake dessert. My only complain is that the portions could have been bigger. The ambience in the restuarant and the service was personable and fast
5
I was here in November with my family and we had a wonderful meal, even waited upon by Dave, one of the owners!I returned on Friday evening with my future daughter in law and everything was just as good.We started with the salad of smoked duck and generous helping of baked Camembert, followed by Ocean Crab Pasta and the Pork Rack, both sensational as were the Sweet Potato Fries. for dessert we both chose the terrific Valrhona Cacao.The ambience and design of the place is very cool and stripped back, the tables well apart and the service charming. All of which made for a most enjoyable evening
4
We stopped here after a meal nearby....there are so many good places to eat! This is good value and service, plus nice strong black cofffee...I would go again!
5
I was staying up the road and discovered this place by walking past it and seeing they did a set dinner menu for S$50 nett including a drink so I popped in on the Saturday night. I was so happy with the place that I returned the next morning at 11.30am for brunch.So, I chose the set dinner menu with a very tasty soup, delicious pork main course and dessert with a point of beer. The service was very friendly with iced water topped up frequently and plenty of smiles. Food quality was excellent (the pork on a bed of cabbage was delicious) and it ended up being surprisingly good value for Singapore (although it is out of the way a bit in the backpacker district of Little India).The next morning I returned for brunch and had the full English breakfast. Again, high quality ingredients including the sausage (which is the ingredient that often lets breakfasts down).If I'm in the area again I would definitely return
5
Good service, top-notch quality in a cosy atmosphere. A hidden gem inside Little India if you are looking for something different in the area.
4
Food was delicious specially the butter chicken with paratha.... We enjoyed the food and also their lassi.... I loved the lassi....
5
food quality and quantity both great. service is efficient and friendly even though there's no service charge
5
Thanks Tina for another great welcome and another great meal. Crab pasta fantastic as always and the beef cheeks were melt in the mouth. See you again soon.

I was there with my friend for a friday evening dinner. Since it was our first time there, it took us some time to browse through the menu. We selected a soup and 2 main dishes after getting suggestions from the waiteress.Service was great and there is free wifi.The roasted tomato soup was very delicious and tasty but not the same can be said of the ocean crab pasta. The pasta has a mild sweetness and not much of other taste. The alantic sea bass was fresh and nicely cooked, but a little over salted on the skin
4
I think risotto is a good measure of a kitchen. There's so many ways it can go wrong. The "Seasonal Roots Rice" here is not only an interesting dish, but it's beautifully done too. We also tried the "Ocean Crab Pasta" and the "Banana Bailey Bread & Butter Pudding", and I can give those the thumbs up too.I think what you get with Roots Kitchen Bar is homey food done very well. It's not about micro-portions or art degree plating, it's just good non-pretentious food.The service was friendly and professional, the drinks happy hour runs until 8pm and the ambience is laid-back and conducive to enjoying the company of friends. If you're looking for a friendly, casual place for a relaxed night out then it's pretty much exactly what you want.Reading a couple of past reviews, I think Roots may have had some early problems with getting the food out in decent time, but we didn't experience that at all. Actually, the front of house staff impressed us with the service and deserve a special mention. Water glasses were kept topped up, questions about dishes could be answered, and they were on hand at all the right times without hovering or intruding, and it was all done with a smile.You've got a lot of choices for eating in Little India, but Roots Kitchen Bar is certainly worth putting on your list if you're not in the mood for Indian cuisine.Prices are nett and very reasonable. Limited seating, so reserve if you can
2
Ordered steak and waited for almost an hour for it. Was the wait worth it? Not really in my opinion. The steak portion was good, but overly salted. The potato mash did not sit well with me either. Restaurant is located in a secluded, hard to reach area. Will not recommend visiting unless you happen to be in the area.
4
Had the eggs & truffle mousseline, which was very frothy and the mushrooms at the bottom served quite a punch. Also came with a deal of getting a capp at only additional $2. The sea bass and london broil (steak) took at least forty minutes to be served, so mind you if you're pressed for time. The sea bass was very fresh and well cooked, and the aspagarus and celery side was fully enjoyable as well, even for a non-fan of celery.Definitely enjoyed the iced dark mocha here, in which I could fully taste the coffee and the choc wasn't too sweet. I usually take my lattes without sugar, just for reference.Lastly, the bread and butter pudding was crusty and the bailey's cream complemented it very well. Will come back again
4
Great little gastro pub in the heart of little india. Very attentive service, great food and super stylish decor. Steak cooked to perfection. We had dinner there and would highly recommend the 'London Broil', steak with potato puree, mixed root vegetables and red wine jus. Excellent value for money and prices don't include GST or SVC. Will be back for sure
5
Very attentive staff, great service, terrific food. After having dinner there at night, we wanted to return for coffee before leaving for the airport the next day. The restaurant was closed that day, but the owner saw us, invited us in, and offered to make us coffee
3
If you appreciate very frequent stops by your table and lots of conversation with the servers, this place is for you. Cozy decor. Only two (low end) wines available by the glass. When I inquired about veg options, I was offered the mango duck salad without the duck. It came without any mango either, so was literally just a small bowl of greens and tomato. They still charged the full $12. I think there is potential here, but it's not quite polished. The highlight was a kind man who worked tirelessly to get us a taxi on a rainy night, which was much appreciated.
5
Got stuck in Singapore due to great Philadelphia Blizzard of 2016 (65cm). Was looking for good quiet place to eat before flying home. Great food, excellent value. Derrick (the owner) and Athena, the waitress are a delight. Great service with a big smile. Try the loaded sweet potato fries, awesome. Big portion! Derrick was kind enough to make a special small size for me (still a lot of food). Did the 3 course special. Sea bass was great. Gotta have the ice cream sandwich with marshmallow ice cream. Bon apetit
5
Walked in last night (Sunday) after reading great reviews on TA... sensational and very friendly staff and some sensational food. Can highly recommend the vodka cured salmon and also the flank steak dish, although I did suffer a bit of food envy when the lady opposite me had the signature pasta dish delivered to her table , it looked absolutely amazing. Definitely heading back there next time I'm in Singapore .
5
This place is an absolute gem.Exceeded all reviews on here. The value for money is exceptional and having no extra charges from the price on the menu was great. Staff were sensationaly friendly and the food was perfect I wish we went here sooner but it was our last night in Singapore, we will get back to our roots one day.
5
Only had 4 days in Singapore and with limited time and a 7 and 9 year old with us we have mostly been "feasting" on BK, McD and similar. Stumbled across Roots on TA and what brilliant luck that turned out to be.The street and location are not very nice, but once you get there, you are greeted by really friendly staff, seated in nice surroundings and the food was delicious (PERFECT). We had 3 starters, 3 main courses, 3 desserts and a perfectly tempered Merlot. Approx price 200 SGD, which felt a bit like a steal...Do not miss this place if you are in the neighbourhood, and even if you are not, find a way to get there - a must go! And the biggest 5.0 I have ever dished out
5
Im in singapore for just 3 days but this is the best food so far. Good service, and really nice food! Next time I go to Singapore i'll be back for sure!
4
The staff were excellent in there service from the waiter to manager very good . They helped us with the menu and had a very relaxing chat about the area and Cool places to visit near by. We both tried the pasta dishes and were pleasantly surprised. The. Dishes were very good and feeling. A bit pricy I thought but for the service and the vibe of the place no doubt great. Thank you. 
5
My eldest son, his fiancée and I visited here early on a Friday evening having already made a reservation.My first impressions were of an exciting looking restaurant, plenty of space between tables, a mixture of stripped back brickwork and distressed plaster containing an interesting yet practical layout.The menu is varied and original and was explained to us in great detail, it's not extensive just interesting and well constructed, same with the drinks list overleaf no showing off here with long fancy lists which was good to see.Another aspect that impressed me was the ratio of staff to tables, plenty of charming servers on hand with smart 'Roots' polo shirts, all very professional and friendly.I had the Absolut salmon starter which was fabulous, followed by the roasted sea bass, simply done yet terrific, the family chose mushroom soup, camembert, carbonara.The desserts were ridiculously good and finished off a truly enjoyable experience.Most of our serving was done by a chap called David and he didn't quite fit in to how I imagined a waiter to be as he was a little older than the rest of the team so I quizzed him and as it turns out he designed the place!As we were leaving the restaurant had filled up with an eclectic crowd of diners, maybe drawn to Roots as we were by the excellent reviews here
5
What a find!! Excellent food, amazing service served with the perfect ambience. The silverleaf shiraz from WA was impeccable. Please don't miss this one. Don't be put out by the location. It truly is the diamond in the rough.
5
One of the nice upcoming restaurant in Singapore. Rustic decor but delicious food. I had a very tasty mushroom soup followed by a nice and crisp grilled seabass and the waffle with figue ice cream, all of this for a reasonable 50$ or so. Definitely a place to visit a few times
5
Meals are awesome with reasonable price.
Never forget to come here when you visit Singapore.
P.S. Still remember how beautiful meal I had last night
5
Good service, relaxing atmosphere and i like the food so much.
I really wanna meet the cook to tell them how really i love there food.
5
I was in the mood for a romantic dinner with my husband and we just happen to stroll by. We were reading the menu outside and it looked lovely, however after all the very heavy Christmas food we had these past days, I felt like something simple. I was immediately impressed by the flexibility and readiness to accommodate my wishes. I felt like some nice beef and lots of vegetables. Even though it was not on the menu I got a beautifully prepared salad and rib eye cooked at perfection medium rare. with more vegetables on the side. I always tell my husband that you can tell a lot about a restaurant in the care they put in preparing a simple salad.The whole experience was absolutely exquisite,delicate aesthetically beautiful and delicious. It reminded me of my two favorite french chefs back in Switzerland. The staff was attentive and so quick in reading your mind. The atmosphere was charming too and perfect for our romantic dinner
5
The food was amazing and the ambiance was beautiful with a real Christmas tree (rare and expensive in Singapore :-)Extremely kind and attentive service and the prices very reasonableThe cook is gem and really high classWe WILL be back
5
I have to admit the area didn't look to promising but the outstanding service, ambient and food made the trip way worth it! Would definitely recommend

The Missus and I resided in the Moon Hotel during our trip and was looking through Trip advisor for a good place to have dinner and came across Roots. We decided to give it a shot as it was just opposite our hotel and we didn't want to have any Indian food.Upon reaching there, we were greeted by very accommodating staffs and was specially pleased with the peaceful ambience. We had the 3 course meal and the wife fell in love with the Belgian Waffle with Artisan Ice Cream. Even jokingly suggest she would leave me for a lifetime supply of their deserts. The price of beer during happy hour is an absolute steal considering the area that we are staying at. Will definitely visit again the next time I am back in Town. Keep up the good work
5
On our family holiday with a 4 yr old and 6 month old, we decided to do a quick evening visit to Little India as we didn't expect to get another chance to come to see this part of town again on this trip. We discovered Roots through the TripAdisor app, while we were there and was curious about the location of a well rated restaurant. So we decided to walk about 1km to reach there pushing a stroller though the busy streets. Roots Kitchen Bar definitely didn't disappoint for that effort. Located in a very non assuming location added to the charm of the place. Small yet neatly decorated and clean; this place definitely gave the sense that the owners had a "passion" for what they doing. Staff were extremely friendly catering to the needs of a now tired and irate 5 year old, while expertly helping us through the menu. We shared an onion and cheese bake starter, fried sweet potato and pork and crab sticks pasta. Food was really good. The Belgian waffle with artisan ice cream was even better. Also enjoyed the happy hour beer. Overall it was an EXPERIENCE I will remember. Only partially negative comment was the noodles instead of real pasta for the crab stick dish. All else was great.I am a big fan of discovering quirky; not in the face kind of places while being a tourist. I highly recommend this place, especially if you are on a touristy walk about through Little India
4
We stayed at Wanderlust during our trip to Singapore, and stumbled across Roots one evening while looking for somewhere to eat.We both had the three course set menu which was delicious- I especially loved the desserts!Great value for money and unlike many other places in Singapore, the price of alcohol isn't too scary
5
The staff is super nice, good atmosphere, and of course, awesome food here. Perfect place to visit for relaxing, meeting cool people, and enjoying the food. You come here once, and you will come back again. SOON
5
Visited colourful & lovely Little India and what a lovely surprise to find a beautiful and cosy bar + cafe. Ambience is great, Bar area is very pretty and nice decor. I loved the soups , had starters and main course . Cheese platter was good and the sea bass was yummy. I look forward to visiting soon , will make my reservations soon. Nice and attentive service , made my visit pleasant . Good service from Mr Derek to my family and friends .
5
The food is quite good in a comfortable place.
Every dish has its delicate decoration.
Love it so much. Must come again.
5
All the foods we ordered are just incredibly delicious and worthy, and the service are nice too. I have to say it's my favorite bar in Singapore so far.
5
Fresh ingredients + lovely atmosphere + great customer service + affordable = ALL WORTH IT! Will be back for sure!
5
Unexpected GEM with great service. The mushroom soup and pork rack were tasty and unique. Great for couples and casual business dining. They also serve Dalmore whisky and good selection of wine.
5
As per title.
Came here for dinner, noted the breakfast part of the menu and decided to come back the following day. Excellent food; was very happy to see they offer a "full English". Awesome.
P.s. great draught beer.

The first time I felt totally misled by Trip Advisor. The #61 restaurant in Singapore rated excellent was completely empty when we walked in for a Saturday night dinner at 8PM during the holiday season ... and the menu was surprisingly minimal too ... steak ordered medium was delivered practically raw ... everything on the plate was cold when served ... the staff was very friendly and pleasant but it was a disappointing meal ... makes we doubt I can trust restaurant reviews and ratings on Trip Advisor ..
4
We had a late dinner on a Friday night a few weeks back. Service was friendly and warm. Decor and lighting is nice, but ambiance would be much improved if music was more fitting -- i think pop/dance music doesn't work and we found it annoying and at times loud. My husband and I both had soups, which were good. The risotto I tried lacked flavor, and I can't remember what my husband ordered, which I guess is telling. I think this place has potential, and at it price point is welcome in Singapore
4
Situated in the heart of Little India, Singapore, we almost walked past at first because there was a van parked outside blocking the front of the restaurant. Luckily my partner spotted the menu stand at the side of the road.Our first impression was of a very smart and trendy bar-restaurant. It was approximately 7:30 in the evening and beer was on offer at happy hour prices. We ordered Asparagus rice and baked camembert with a beer and cold mineral water. The beer was an excellent Danish brew.The meal was good but not great. My first niggle was the designer lettuce which I dislike intensely the second niggle which really got me was the endless soundtrack of American christmas songs, it was only 29 Nov, for goodness sake. I certainly will not go back until well after christmas for that reason alone
5
2nd visit with my different group of friends at roots kitchen bar ! Great steal on our end to find such quality food with no service nor GST charge. Steak was very delicious , juicy and well cooked to perfection . Definitely of great quality, I also had the mushroom soup which was the smoothest and best tasting I've had. My girlfriends and I love the decor and feel of the whole place, we love chilling in roots and great attentiveness to details with the sockets for phone & ipads charging plus free wifi for all. Will be back for another Christmas gathering. Keep up the good service and amazing food 
5
My wife and I had one night in Singapore on a stop-over from England. Checked out reviews on Trip adviser and decided to give this restraunt a go. What a great choice. Situated on the edge of Little India, an area popular with locals, this is a jewel of a place. Small menu with every dish freshly cooked. Great tasting food and extremely good value. The owner and staff were very welcoming and the chef introduced himself at the end of our meal. Would highly recommend as we had a lovely evening
5
Had dinner here a few times. High quality and great taste! I doubt anywhere else serve such good food at this pricing. Dessert is amazing too. Banana Baileys is a must try! Often sold out. Best call to reserve.
5
I was at Roots Kitchen Bar for a business meeting and on a separate occasion, a friend's birthday celebration. This restaurant is perfect for any occasion, from corporate appointments in the afternoon to dinner and chill spot for friends and family in the night! Super cosy!As a foodie, the quality of food is crucial to any of my dining experience. It was such a pleasant experience knowing the soup/foods were all made from scratch - truly back to basics! You have got to try their mushroom and tomato soup (yes, i love both), and their Nagano pork rack (tender, juicy w my fav grape compote). I liked the loaded sweet potato fries as a side for sharing w my friends - we all loved the jalenpêno and fritter cheese! I have also tried their brunch food, and thoroughly enjoyed the pulled pork omelette (Pig&Eggs) and ginseng coffee too. Their Ginseng coffee truly provided a much needed perk-me-up! The chef and host, Derek were very hospitable as well. All in all, it was a fantastic experience, I will be back real soon
5
Had dinner and drinks with my best friends in this place a couple of times and i must say the quality of the food serve in this place really above my expectation and the price are set at a very affordable range! (it really rare to find nowadays)The servers were very attentive and the owner himself never failed to personally welcome us and sit us down every single time!I cant to be back for the Nagano Pork Rack and definitely a great place for dating!the location is near to Bugis and Little India MRT station with about 5-7 mins walk, centrally located, easy to find parking and great place to throw a birthday party or event
5
I have been to the place for 3-4 times for my lunch and dinner yet I still find each visit enjoyable because the ingredients used to prepare each and every dish are nothing but the freshest and of the best quality. One of the best dish is the sea bass. You don't need to be a chef to tell how good and fresh it is. :
5
I suggested to my friends that we celebrate an upcoming birthday at Roots Kitchen Bar in Little India. I had eaten there recently and quite liked the food as well as the 'chill' feel of the place. Not modern chic cool but 'warm chillax' friendly nice.The 10 of us covered almost the whole menu, for sharing.The mushroom soup was quite out of this world - creamy mushroom with creamy leek. Just as good was the tomato soup - creamy nutty with a tinge of sweet/sour. So good we ordered 3 bowls of each.The cured salmon appetiser was almost crunchy-fresh, with a very nice sauce.The London broil ribeye was tasty and tender.The 300gsm pork rack was juicy, served with (pickled I think) cabbage, like we were in Germany except it's finer here. The sea bass was well seared, crispy skin and moist meat.The 2 pastas (crab angel hair and pancetta carbonara linguine) and porcini risotto were yumms and were polished off almost immediately that we ordered another set.The pulled pork omelette and jalapeño sweet potato fries were added on, as we came with hearty appetites. Dessert was the house's special Bailey bread and butter birthday pudding.Plus 2 and a half bottles of wine, we tres enjoyed the birthday celebration dinner!Glad we came to this restaurant, delicious food, friendly service and cosy ambience
5
Shared a Wild Mushroom Soup which was a very pleasant surprise. Best mushroom soup ever! The soup is smooth and just the right temperature. The sprinkling of truffle and bits of hazel nuts were delightful with every spoon. Which I had the whole plate to myself.Shared the Atlantic Seared Atlantic Sea Bass and London Broil as our mains. The fish was very nicely done. Cooked just right every part with the seared flavour. The skin was just a tad tough but that's because the rest of the dish was flawless. The sautéed celery especially, together with the asparagus, prawn and calamari nicely balanced the very clean but still yummy taste. The calamari gave the bite.We asked for the London Broil to be done medium. I think it came out just a bit under and was a little bit tough. I loved the potato puree and the sauce of the dish. It gave each mouthful a wonderful light fragrance I enjoyed. We finished the meal with a Citron and Passion. They inadvertently left out our other order. The sourness was just right - not overpowering. The sweet part was a bit under. I felt that that the choice of cookie could be better. The passion fruit in the ice cream was a nice touch. They serve the Danish Draft beer. It is rather light beer but I think it goes well with the type of food. The atmosphere is nice - a simple modern throw back feel. The music is modern folk-rock-pop. It was quiet when we were there so service was prompt. Not sure when it is more busy. The place is tucked away in a corner of a very short row of shops that are set-back opposite Hotel 81. We missed it first time along Dickson Street cause a van was parked in front blocking it. Though the menu is not very long, there are other items on it that we would definitely return to try. The place is value for money. In Singapore, that's a precious find. We will be back

Celebrated my friend's birthday and I'm so glad we picked roots! Service was excellent and very efficient,kudos to the team for assisting in the surprise celebration, from getting us the candles to preparing her a beautifully plated and very delicious dessert. Quality food at extremely reasonable prices, very wallet friendly with no gst and no service charge! Both The tomato and mushroom soup were highly raved by all my friends at the table, truly served with fresh ingredients and by a great chef! We ordered the pork rack - meat was tender and juicy, the cabbage and raisins complemented it very well . Crabmeat pasta with lobster bisque was sooo tasty and a hot favorite amongst my friends. Pulled pork omelette and sweet potato fries were superb! Perfect for sharing .Desserts were delish as well, banana baileys had a slight crisp and Rich choc on the top of the flavorful bread+butter pudding. Another dessert we ordered was the citron and passion curd served with an ice cream sandwich with bits of marshmallows inside- one of the best I've had, burst of both colours and flavors! I had ginseng coffee for drinks while my friends had pints of beer during happy hours that doesn't end till 8pm, only $9 for a pint, quite a steal for such a lovely place. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening in roots kitchen bar, the ambience was great , the decor was beautiful and also I got to charge my hand phone at the bar top table with multiple sockets for charging.Such convenience and thoughtfulness , will definitely be visiting again

A little paradise on India neighborhood of Singapore where you could find good meal, a good place where you could find a good company and not at least the very good staff that serve you and also make you to feel the most important person on the earth. Thank you guys fot everything

Had lunch at this restaurant last Wednesday, liked the rustic, unpretentious feel of the place and the unique dishes.Enjoyed the pork rack very much, ordered the 200gsm portion - it was served de-boned sliced, together with 'clean' rack. The vegetable that it was served with was quite unique and delicious (almost like coleslaw, with nice sauce and dried grape or raisin). The meat was juicy.The crabmeat linguine was coated in creamy sauce and served with shredded crabmeat - can tasty the rich crab/lobster? base in the sauce.The seabass was also very good - fresh and the skin seared crispy. It was the first time anyone of us had egg benedict on waffle - unusual but nice, the waffle smelled really good! Also the mushroom soup is the real thing
5
Today is my second time at Roots Kitchen Bar. I'd say this place is a gem in the area because the food on the menu was soooooo good! A little tough to locate for first timers but it'll become a landmark after you've been there. So, I was first introduced by a friend who repeatedly said their mushroom soup was very good. My first try left me coming back for more. On my first trip, all 11 of us unanimously agreed how good the mushroom soup was. Those who didn't order during the first order, placed their order after trying a mouthful of it. It tasted creamy and was flavourfuly rich in mushroom. The bits of hazelnut made the texture less boring and it comes with a slice of bread. It's a dish you must try!I tried the roasted tomato soup on my second trip (today) and boy, this place has really good soups! It tasted equally outstanding and RKB should just take my wallet already. hahaha My bf, whom I shared the 2 soups with, was impressed too! I loved the ocean crab pasta which I had on my first trip! It wasn't gelad after mouthfuls of it and I liked that it was neatly plated when presented. I tired Pig and Eggs today. it was something special to me As it tasted like a fusion of western and chinese food.The pork slices was wrapped in the omelette together with cheese. The egg was soft and it balanced the stronger tastes from the pork and sauteed mushroom. *slurps* My bf had the seabass and we loved how the skin was crispy but the meat stayed tender,moist and juicy on the inside. His eyes beamed with joy when he tried the Banana Bailey dessert! You've got to spread the banana paste and nutella on the soft, fluffy cake before enjoying this dish of goodness. Staffs were extremely helpful and friendly. Derek explained the mouth watering dishes patiently while Adel addressed us by our names when she bids us goodbye. Price was really reasonable for the quality of food, service and ambience.I created an account on tripadvisor just so I can give credit to this awesome place! Hope you (future) roots kitchen bar goers enjoy yourselves as much as I do and try this before the long queues form. Cheers

Went to this place last weekend with friends and was blown away with its buttery lobster bisque richness with real crab meat! Not to forget its mushroom soup that is not too thick.
Best part... NO GST NO SVC CHARGE ;)

The moment I stepped inside, I was blown away by the simple yet cosy interior. Almost immediately, I felt comfortable and at ease. The staffs welcomed us with a big smile on their faces and showed us to our table. Ice water was given to us almost immediately too. My friends and I took quite some time to decide on what to eat, as we are too spoilt for choices. In the end, I decided to settle on London Broil. Boy do I not regret it. The meat was tender and juicy. I am not even kidding when I say that it melts in your mouth. On top of that, the mash potato was just simply amazing. The portion was small, but enough. P.s. I am quite a small eater. As a fan for anything vintage, I was pleasantly surprised to see my root beer served in a vintage looking bottle! I liked it so much i brought the bottle home.Overall, Roots Kitchen Bar is an AMAZING place. I would definitely come back here next time

Food - we had the mushroom and roasted tomato soup, and couldn't decide which was better. Loved them both. Real mushroom, made magical by the leek fondue. The crabmeat topping the tomato soup tipped the scale.The braised beef cheek on a mash bed was a hit with 4 of my friends who had that for their main - the meat was tender and moist.Pasta lovers in our group swore by their ocean crab linguine and porcini risotto.Our sharing plate of loaded sweet potato fries was devoured in a jiffy, we ordered a second serving.The restaurant had a homey cosy feel, perfect for our birthday celebration.We got all the service we needed (no service charge!) on a busy night for them.Absolutely happy with the prices. For 10 of us, the meal plus 2 bottles of red, the bill came up to about $430.Suggestion for improvement: needs better signage coz some of my friends took a while to locate it

Was at roots with some of my friends and i must say it is one of the best places to chill. Place is very cozy & the food made it even better! Loved the pulled pork omelette, mushroom soup & crab linguine! Decided to head back for more because the dinner menu looked great! We thoroughly enjoyed their rack of pork, banana bailey and citron&passion curd dessert! Overall, it is a place i would definitely introduce my friends to!

Went for the brunch as I was intrigued by what I saw from their facebook posts, small boutique cafes and restaurants are springing up all over singapore, especially within this district of Singapore, been a serious long while since I went for brunch in a boutique cafe because of two reasons:1) these operators are usually selling the atmosphere, food is below average.2) You dont pay for a premium thus u usually get crappy foodBUT this place serves glorious food, menu which is really planned painstakingly and with passion. Price range is much affordable but please do tip, because they dont charge GST nor service charge. (and it doesnt hurts for a couple of dollars but it will mean alot for the excellent service staff there)I tried a couple of items off the menu and left a happy and full man, I think the linguine with crabmeat in a lobster bisque base is very different and simply not just another pasta dish. Its directly opposite moon hotel at dickson road, walking distance from bugis and sim lim square. Do try

Serving top-notch food made out of the highest-quality ingredients; Roots kitchen bar taints the impression of fine-dining by delivering excellent food at cheap prices. With no gst or service charge is added to your bill, you don't have to worry about seeing that jump in prices at the end of your meal. A must try: pulled pork omelette, London broil, eggs benedict with caviar and the banana-Bailey dessertIf you are looking for alcohol: their craft beers specially imported all the way from Norway, will renew your love for the alcoholic beverage once again. A personal favourite is the Konrad's stout and the lucky jack to savour especially after a long and tiring day. This place is definitely worth your time and money.

Was there with my boyfriend one evening for dinner. I must say I absolutely loved the ambience! It had a little rustic european vibe to it. The food was so good as well! I highly recommend the mushroom soup, which may seem a little overpriced at first, but when you taste it, you'll know why ;) Best I have tasted! It has a nutty flavour to it, with leeks and mushrooms in it complete with a sourdough bread at the side. The next rave would be what my boyfriend ordered which was the sea bass! It was so fresh and had a natural sweetness to the fish, yum. (I stole quite a bit from the bf :p)We ordered Banana Baileys which what was recommended for desserts, it's good on its own, but i think a scoop of ice cream on top of it would make it even better! Will be back for more! :

I was there for a dinner gathering with some old classmates. I have to say I was mighty impressed with the overall experience. i ordered the "London broil" which melted in my mouth and tasted better than more established restaurants. The service was warm and friendly and everyone at my table had a really great time. I hope this place continues its high standards as I'm excited to come back and try the other dishes. - Aaro

The newly opened Roots served up a delightful menu of good European dishes.I had dinner there with 5 others on their 'soft' opening night.The place had a welcome, rustic ambience - not too fussy.The food was good, aspiring towards fine:The starters kinda set our expectations for the rest of the meal - we were wowed.The egg mousseline was creamy, tasty and had a 'luxurious' feel in my mouth. The mushroom soup was about the best I have had -well textured from blended real schrooms, with a dollop of leek fondue and topped with drops of (pesto?) oil.The meat mains came with delicious sides- veal flank was accompanied by a well seasoned mash (portion could be more generous)- pork rack had a handsome well-frenched rib and was served with a special coleslaw (again, could be more generous with the slaw)The risotto was the star of the mains! Just the right level of creaminess, bite in the grains, the very flavorful.The crabmeat linguine might not look too appealing but we were soon won over by the taste, chunks of sweet crabmeat and the sauce.The 'banana bread n pudding' and the ice cream cookie sandwich came as highly recommended house specials and they certainly did not disappoint at all!And we were pleasantly surprised by the bill of $187 for orders of 4 starters, 5 mains, 4 desserts, 2 bottles of house wines (plus 2 bottles brought in).We did alright at Roots Kitchen Bar on Tuesday night
