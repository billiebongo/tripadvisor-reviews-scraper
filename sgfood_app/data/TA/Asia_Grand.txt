Came here for lunch and loved the dim sum we ordered. We wished there was a wider selection though - half the reason for dim sum is soup dumplings! No soup dumplings :( but everything we ate was awesome.
4
Great food quality comes at a cost!
We had peking duck, winter melon soup, sucking pig, sliced beef steaks, and red bean paste cakes.
Location easy to find, just across from Chijmes or Raffles City.

Had Dim Sum lunch. Good selection. We were a party of 5 and the restaurant portion out the dishes in the appropriate proportion for 5. No overeating or someone being left out. Very considerate. Make sure you book as it is very popular
5
This is an excellent choice in terms of service, food, atmosphere and pricing. Can not ask for anymore.

My family was recommended to this restaurant by a very friendly Uber driver. We arrived early without a reservation on a Monday mid-morning. We were ushered in as soon the restaurant opened. The selection of dim sum here was reasonable because they expected guests to order other food too. As we already ate but going there, we limited our order to dim sum only. Boy! Are we in for a surprise. The food was delicious and the servings were generous. The service was impeccable. There was no need for us to tell the service personnel to refill our tea cups. We greatly enjoyed our brunch there. Will definitely go there to try their Peking Duck
4
Was recommended by the locals that this was the place to select to enjoy a traditional dim sum lunch. Food and service was excellent - however the choices were to our surprise somewhat restricted compared to our expectations. As a party of six, the restaurant ensured that all selections were in multiples of six and all dishes were served piping hot and in a timely manner. All in all, an excellent choice in first class surroundings

My husband and I chose this restaurant because we wanted a Dim Sum lunch and the restaurant was handy to our hotel. The food was nice and of good quality and the service very good but we were rather disappointed in the Dim Sum menu selection. My husband does not eat meat but does eat seafood so usually we can find a large range of Dim Sum dishes which we can share. However my husband had very little choice at this restaurant with even the prawn dumplings having mince meat with the shrimp. We will try another Dim Sum place next time

Our group, meeting in Singapore, was invited by the local authorities for a welcome dinner, and it was a smashing success. The meal started with prawns, pancakes with Peking Duck, mushrooms, soup and the highlight was suckling pig. The service was swift, and there was a great ambiance around the round tables. Wine, beer and tea were on offer
4
I ate there yesterday and had to go back again today I enjoyed it so much. Right next to the Carlton hotel and a block from Raffle City mall, so very convenient since I was staying at the Carlton (from Seattle). This is a very popular place on Saturday and Sunday mornings for families. I think I was the only non-Chinese person there. The staff was very friendly. Prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommend
5
We stumbled upon this treasure among the plethora of options in singapore one night whilst strolling the streets looking for a decent meal that didn't cost the earth. We returned two more times during our weeklong stay. This evening we had the magnificent 2 course Peking duck experience which did not disappoint. Service is exceptional and the food, enjoyed by mostly only locals is a high end setting without the high end price tag. Superb.
4
Our lunch here at a local Chinese restaurant was quite impressive. While the place was quite busy and noisy the food here was quite good and frankly beat our low expectation. Food is tasty in Chinese tradition way. Soup was mild but fresh.
5
Asia Grand has many excellent options, best served as a variety of dishes and shared. Large tables available to accommodate big groups as well.
4
I had lunch with a bunch of colleagues at Asia Grand. We had dim sum and steamed fish. All of which was excellent. The service is fuss-free but efficient.
5
never mind the reasonably priced, delicious, yummy food! the service was superb...SUPERB! everyone was eager to serve with a smile! especially impressed when my empty glass was filled up within 30secs!
definitely looking for opportunities to be back again!

My sister arranged annual birthday dinner for our mother, a family affair that took up 3 tables plus. Started off with lotus paste buns, OK. Then the good stuff, roast piglet, doubled-boiled soup, fish done in fried and stir-fry, garlic garnished prawns, roast chicken followed by vegetable dish, fried noodles (all appropriate for a sumptuous Cantonese Dinner.)On top of that, excellent service whereby plates were changed after appropriate dish.Rounding off with freshly cut fruits and pancake delight. All in all, a great feast of a celebratory meal
3
I went there for dim sum as always heard that it is really good. I ordered siew mai(not bad), fried glutinous rice(average), xiao long bao(nice, somehow i feel better and bigger than dim tai fung), roasted park(average but have crispy skin) and deep fried intestine(taste ok but i can't appreciate it). The other good part is the shrimp chili, that is really nice, we had 2 sauce plate.Overall dim sum is good but pricey too. I saw a lot of people ordered peking duck so i guess duck dishes also the signature
5
Decided to have a meal here after some research on restaurants which serve Peking Duck. We entered apprehensively as it looked "upmarket" and big dollar signs swirled in my head.We need not have worried. We were made to feel very welcome by the professional and attentive staff.The special of the evening was a whole Peking Duck for $S40. How good was that? Needless to say we ordered that plus some BBQ pork belly and mixed green vegetables. All were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. In fact we ordered way too much for 2 people and unfortunately left a lot of duck meat. We couldn't even take it with us because we were leaving the next day.This restaurant was packed with locals which is a very good sign.Highly recommended
4
While entering this place, the experience started. Entertainment pure.... I have never seen so many waiters in one place. While sitting down (2 people) some other waiters are clearing the table, the remaining is asking for our drinks. The place is frozen down, so do not forget to bring a sweater! The food was great. We came for dimsum, but were informed that they are only served at lunch. Prices are higher then in your average chinese restaurant at the corner, but it is worth it! Try the spinach with carlic
3
Portions are quite large (ie u get 6 pieces of egg tarts, baked puffs). The best for me was the Siew mai. As we arrived at 10am, the appetizer selection were still not available. So we only had limited order. Place was quite busy though.Advise is: book a table.. arrive after 1130 hours
5
Restaurant is conveniently located, walking distance from City Hall mrt. Had a great Tim Sum lunch with my Parents , Uncle and Cousin. We really enjoyed all dishes especially the pork knuckles in vinegar, and chicken feet! The Peking duck is delicious and value for money. Service is excellent too! Would recommend to visit this restaurant.
5
This friendly Chinese Restaurant offers a truly wonderful Peking Duck, sliced and prepared at your table. The seafood is also fresh and delicious and the vegetables are crisp and tasty. The bill was a pleasant surprise too, really good value and highly recommended.
4
We were invited here for a birthday celebration. The food was delicious. The service great. The sucking pig was very well done. Good place to hold a celebration.
5
We were the last customers at lunch time, but they were very friendly. Dim sum were perfect. I would come back!
5
One of the best restaurants around. Do make your reservations to avoid disappointment.
We went for their dim sum and had a wonderful meal.
4
Took some time to decide what to eat cos there's so much to choose from in the menu! There were 4 of us and we ordered steamed bamboo clams, crab with egg white, yam ring, claypot rice, roast chicken, spinach & fish skin with egg yolk. Plus 2 types of soup - the chicken with black fungus and rice wine and winter melon seafood soup. The food is of good quality and the service is great! Total $356 for 4 of us and we really 'stuffed our faces' with so much food! We had to give dessert a mis

Asia Grand have been one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Singapore and I reckon it is for many too: Food is consistently good and reasonably priced with service always attentive including from the owner and his senior managers. Many of their staff have been with them for years; which says a lot for how the restaurant is managed and run.Their Chinese food is predominantly Cantonese probably because of the owner and executive chefâ€™s Hong Kong heritage. They are quite famous and very popular for their lunchtime dim sum. I always go there as default family or business meals, and always order their lup mei fun: rice slow-cooked with preserved meats such as Chinese sausages, liver rolls, waxed duck and vegetables in a clay pot. They use very high quality ingredients and there is a huge serving of choy sum vegetables for balance. Even the smallest portion is a meal in itself; ample for two to three persons. The sauce they pour over the dish is very delicious; like the icing on the cake. When you finished eating, you can ask them to use the scrappings of the burnt rice on the pot to cook with stock for a soup to round off the meal.They are also well known for their roast pork, Peking duck, steamed chicken with ham and all manners of fresh seafood (yes, they have several tanks of them). For the vegetarian, they would recommend their bean curd with spinach and enoki mushrooms. I also love their stir-fried vegetables of sweet peas, lily bulbs and cashew nuts; something you can pick on as the meal progresses.They are one of the older Chinese restaurants in Singapore; having started in the defunct Asia Hotel along Scotts Road (next to Sheraton Towers) and remained very popular for family occasions, dining with clients or just a simple but very good Chinese meal!They are conveniently located at the ground floor of Odeon Towers (across from the rear of Raffles Hotel or diagonally from Raffles City) with ample car parking space. Reservations are encouraged

Asia Grand is an excellent joint for dim sum with very attentive service in an agreeable if somewhat unexciting environment. There are plenty of tables nicely spread out in the dining room, which is clearly popular with Singaporeans. The main menu covers a la carte dishes whilst the dumplings are ordered off a separate paper list (in English as well as in characters). The choice is somewhat carnivorous (lots of pork) and, regrettably, there is one offering with shark's fin soup but there are sufficient other dishes for pescatarians like me. The pastry is delicate, and the fillings generous and tasty and, if you want some greens, the kai lan is excellent. The shrimp cheong-fun is good but the sauce with the fresh scallop version works less well (too strong/sweet for my taste). The imported Tsing-Tao is ice cold, the tea very acceptable and the prices reasonable. Once your order is in the dishes come thick and fast so you may prefer to request your dim sum on a 'rolling basis'
5
Came here umpteen times with family or colleagues for dim sum. Pricing is very reasonable and location is near City Hall and Bugis. Peking duck is highly recommended in which serving starts around 11am only.All in all worth to make a trip down and try to make reservation in order not to wait too long for a seat
5
Great Cantonese dinner with family and friends! The restaurant is packed we had to wait for 30 minutes for the table but the waiting time worth to try. Good food and impeccable service. I don't know the price because my friend ordered and also payed the bill Definitely to try
4
Haven't had the Cantonese suckling pig at Asia Grand for nearly a year. Ordered one to share with family and friends for lunch and it remained as tasty as before. The size of pig used was the right size to ensure maximum crispiness of the skin while the meat remained tender during the roasting process. Also the fatty layer beneath the skin was reduced. The end result was thin and crispy pieces of suckling pig skin to accompany sprigs of spring onion and dollops of thick sweet sauce on steamed bite-sized pieces of circular flat breads. The chopped pieces of meat were juicy and tender to bite. Asia Grand remains on my list of top Cantonese restaurants to enjoy roasted suckling pig in Singapore

Came here for dim sum lunch this week with some colleagues. Generally ok selection of dim sum and reasonable service. Not too busy in the week before Christmas so no reservation was needed. Paid $85 for 4 people but wasn't quite enough for me.
4
We have been with some friends/collegues recently to this place, we went there for lunch and we had a 10-course menu, among which typical Yee Sang Chinese New Year salad, abalone, scallop gratin, suckling pig, etc. The service was good and the restaurant is in a convenient location. Overall pretty good
4
We accidentally found this restaurant close to our hotel and arrived quite late in the evening before closing time. We quickly chose a couple of dishes of which the sweet and sour pork was exceptional. I don't even recall ordering this dish as it often is prepared in a rather bland way. But this this was full of flavours and had great texture. I would like to come again and taste other dishes, too
4
Hey, this place served up the dim sum within 10mins of placing the order! And it was a busy lunch hour on Christmas Day!Impressive service. And they were running a promotion on Peking Duck (@$40/-). Good deal. The duck skin was wrapped and served on the table mid way thru the dim sum. Great!Most dishes are good, and they have my fav 咸水角 (which they call "delicious dumpling"!). Yummy!Couple disappointing dishes, which I would skip next time: 小笼包 (dry, no soup), egg tarts (tasteless and the crust is flaky but oily).Best dishes: steamed rice (盅仔饭), yam dumpling (芋角）and steamed pork ribs.Overall, above average dim sum, like tong lok, and other hotel's Chinese restaurants (wan ting, tien court).Price-wise, like most singapore nice dim sum, about $30 per head
4
If you want to find a not too crowded place, right within the city area (esp. if you're near Raffles Hotel or City Hall area) for some quality Chinese food, Asia Grand is the place to be, where I especially like it for - (1) A good spread of Chinese food - ranging from the roast meat section, Peking Duck, various types of soup, poultry, vegetables, seafood (Think Chilli Crab etc.) (2) Service is good - staffs are very courteous and helpful. (3) Operating hour starts at 11 am - 2.30 pm for lunch, and 5.30 pm - 10 pm for dinner. Hence, you can come here for brunch if you're ok to have it after 11 am or just pop by for lunch or dinner. (4) Location is very convenient - It is just across the road from the famous Raffles Hotel, and it is within 10 minutes walk to the nearest mass transit train station (City Hall) and also 10 minutes walk to the nearby shopping malls (Raffles City or Bugis Junction).Restaurant address is - 331 N Bridge Rd, #01-02 Odeon Towers, Odeon Towers, Tel: 6887-001
5
Everytime I travel to Singapore Asia Grand is a must for me. Make sure you don't go after 1pm because they can run out of certain types of dim sum. You will love the Peking duck or suckling pig. Those are always a must. Make sure you try this place its a hidden gem in the city. Its located right behind the Raffles Hotel
4
the restaurant has been around, with some of the older staff for a long time since its days at scotts road. the new location has better dining facilities. the old location was eventually rebuilt with a new apartment, hamilton scotts. had dined there for more than 15 years, never for once we were disappointed with the food or service. too bad this time around they didn't make it to the michelin books. They deserve better recognition in singapore. serves cantonese dishes and dim sum
3
Attracted to this restaurant because of the Peking duck. I think this is one of the cheapest we can find in town (S$40). However, I think our duck was "over roasted", the skin was rather dry. But the ee fu noodles fried with the duck meat was nice.The dim sum that we tried were generally good too. Service was prompt, restaurant is spacious. Nice place for a family gathering
5
We were invited by a colleague of mine from our Singapore Office. Accordingly this visit was well planed and one of the hot spots for chines food in Singapore. The restaurant was predominately visit by locals (what a contrast to the Raffels). The Peking Dug was just great and very special. Great place if you want to test a broad variety of Chinese food...we had 8 (!) courses.....each to share, which is recommendable. Excellent food..we would come back...
4
We had struggled to find a place on a busy night, so the hotel concierge said try Asia Grand. He described it as Cantonese without fancy white tablecloths. This seemed to resonate with our needs. We had actually walked past it approx 2 hours earlier and were put off by the yellow curtains which seemed to be very unwelcoming. Why the privacy?Once inside, it looked better than we had expected, fears allayed.We ordered several dishes and our trepidation grew when the first 2 meals arrived, as both were not to our taste. Mistake - do not order off the daily special listing or chef's recommendations.After the bad start, we were much happier. Very good diced beef in black pepper, lovely snow peas served with cashew nuts and a very tasty seafood fried rice.Asia Grand satisfied our needs. Had we stopped after the first 2 courses, who knows?
4
Delicious Tim Sum at Asia Grand where they formerly from the old Asia Hotel. Price has gone up but still reasonable
4
Simply love to yum cha at this restaurant. . Reasonable pricing for quality dim sum.. must try the peking duck for $38...
Service is also good...
5
Food and service were awesome. Staff was attentive. I like the Yu Sheng very much but didn't really appreciate the shark fin soup cause I feel too much egg rolls. Overall was great .
4
This is one of my favourite placed for chinese cuisine in Singapore. The Peking Duck is a must: very tasty and crunchy duck skin rolled into a soft wrap, all dipped into a very tasty sauce.I also love the Suckling Pig and the selection of dessert
5
As you mouth opens wide when the food comes, and your eyes pop out at the tasty dishes start coming to your table, so will your eyes and mouth open wide like a goldfish when the bill comes. But I guess it is the price you pay for (excellent) service, and (top) quality food. You cannot go wrong here. The crowd here is terribly large, so reservations are much recommended. But if you do not have cold hard cash, do have at least 3 credit cards. haha
3
We had dinner with friends, a total of 8 adults and 4 teenagers. We ordered a set menu for 10, that was priced at $468++. After we ordered, they came back to tell us that they cannot offer one of the dishes with live prawns as they had run out of live prawns. So their alternative was 'normal' prawns and they can make a salted egg yolks prawn or wasabi prawn. We asked if we can have beef instead, but they came back saying it cannot be done. (Not happy!) We are stuck with their 'normal' prawns, from which we chose the salted egg yolks prawn. The prawns were soggy, and very disappointing. I feel that they should have the flexibility of offering more alternatives when they run out of produce. Why should we be given inferior produce
5
Fret not, if you're looking for an old school Cantonese dim sum. While the interiors are pedestrian, the food is worth shouting about. Wide selection of traditional favourites to choose from. I highly recommend the rolls of prawn and mango. The lotus leaf glutinous rice was decadently moist and bursting with the flavours of scallops.
4
This is a big restaurant and it is full with local regulars.We have been invited here by a very good friend and enjoyed the Chinese hospitality. The Peking Duck is carved at the table and the meat in the noodles at the end of the meal was as delicious as the Peking DuckThere is plenty of fresh seafood, lobsters and fish, all kept in tanks at the one side of the restaurantHere they serve as well more exotic dishes like shark fin soup, not everyone's taste I am sure but something I think is important to mentionService is excellent and always there when neededThe flavor of the food is very good, no doubts, but we did have better in Singapore, that's why it is only 4 stars and not 5 stars...
4
The peking duck @$38 is delicious and value for the money, you may also add $10 to cook the remainder of the duck for another dishes. Majority of the dimsum at this venue is tasty and worth a visit if you have tried before. I must comment that the service is very attentive and the servers will change your plates when needed.
5
We very much enjoyed our lunch, the service was extremely diligent, an empty water glass verged on impossible. The food was quick and extremely tasty, the steamed custard buns for dessert were mouth watering pinnacles of the meal.Trying to find a way to get back as the pieking duck being served to other tables looked amazing
5
The service at this restaurant was amazing. The food, possibly the best Chinese food I have had in years. The Peking duck- 10/10.
4
Followed family here for a lunch to celebrate grandma birthday . Overall good service and decently well food
4
I have been to this place many times. We had many great Cantonese dishes dimsim were great, seasfoods was fresh, tofu hotpot ans roast duck were beautiful. Will do again soon.
4
Good dinner with very good quality of food. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is very cold with very old decorations and set up. Strange also to have to go outside the restaurant in public toilet! Not what I expect from this level of restaurant.
4
We were here for their famous lunch dim sum. Ordered most of the items. Except for egg tarts, chicken feets and pork ribs dim sum, the rest of the dim sums are consider above average. Peking duck is a must order dish. Service standard is definitely above average. I will recommend a return visit to this restaurant
5
Asia grand must be one of my favorite chinese Restuarant in singapore. It is owned by 3 brothers that had migrated to singapore many years back. The Cantonese food is very fine and yummy and it doesn't cost you an arm and leg like some others restaurant.
5
Was craving for good Chinese food and came here on a whim.The Good:1. Excellent service. The staff was super attentive and courteous and we didn't have to wait at all to get their attention for ordering, changing our order, obtaining their recommendation or having our tea refilled. Plus, a super warm welcome at the door. I found it particularly heartening to note that they had some senior staff working here, who've probably been around with the organisation for a good number of years. I suppose the quality they bring to service is markedly different from most other restaurants where you find young undergrad or poly students etc with no training or experience in the service sector.2. Big broad menu.3. Great food quality and 'china'- no pun intended!4. Open till a bit later than most other places.The Not-so-good:I found the seating arrangement, with its big round tables spread all over the place as somewhat unwelcoming and suitable mostly for family and large groups. We visited as a couple and found there were no quiet 2-seated corners or nooks or smaller tables for couples or smaller groups. This is something the management may want to look into
5
Was on vacation with my wife visiting friends.They had booked Asia Grand as I had been there before but not my wife.We had a fabulous meal with the selection of the food being recommended by both Tony and Shirley who made my party most relaxed and indeed we had a great all round time at our table with them.The ambiance of the restaurant is superb as is the professionalism of all the staff.The food and drink we had was really good value for money and I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone lucky enough to visit this great city of SingaporeStewart DavisGlasgowScotlan
5
Had a simple wedding lunch here and booked a private room, the staff were all extremely helpful and patient throughout my endless queries. service during the lunch was impeccable, food and drinks were served promptly and staff were very polite and friendly. the food was excellent too, had a 9 course dinner including the peking duck and roasted pig. thanks very much, had a great time
5
Really amazing Chinese food, maybe the best I ever had. Try the pork belly and jelly fish as a starter and Peking duck as main. All very good.The wine list is quite good and you can find something for less than 100 SGD. As it is a Chinese restaurant the place is not great, but the staff, including the manager was really friendly. We were the only non Chinese people that night and loved it
3
Very busy, with old locals, fast service but not the Hong Kong style taste that we are used to. Lots of Dim Sum choices though.
Had a bit of a commercial touch.
Not cheap.
4
This is the restaurant from the old Asia Hotel on scotts road. Good dim sum... great for entertaining business clients. Even on sundays, reservations recommended.
4
Went there for dinner with a group of 12 friends. It was a birthday celebration and we had a large room. Food was very good and so was service. I would recommend that you talk to the Manager and order the food in advance
3
Nice if you are not too hungry and picky. Best item was the green tea which was punchy. Also enjoyed the wet tower which was handy and free of fragrance. Aircon was adjusted about right.
4
Authentic Chinese restaurant where the clientele are mostly older Chinese people, this is always a good sign. Restaurant has a great ambience and is lively with other patrons. I go here for the duck, but they have a tendency to remove the meat - you need to specifically request they cut the duck with the meat, or you simply get duck skin pancakes. Fried rice is super good too, but dont ask them to add the duck or again you get meatless duck. A lady will roll all of your pancakes herself with chopsticks, so there is minimal effort involved and I don't mind saying, I never intend to roll my own pancakes again. Service is super efficient and friendly, although traditional which adds to the charm of this place. Only problem is I ate too much
5
This is my first time trying out the food at this restaurant. I must say I am pretty impressed with the standard. Service was good and staffs are attentive & polite. Pricing wise pretty much similar to familiar names like Imperial & Crystal Jade. I will definitely be back there again
1
The dim sum is okay. I ordered a Peking Duck. The manager or whoever in blue coat was slicing the skin and another waiter was wrapping the skin up. The waiter is actually sniffing away and cough. I was shocked at the situation as he is coughing in the direction of the plate of Peking duck. I told him and the manager and he can't actually say the cough did not touch the food. The worse is the attitude of the manager who just say change all change all and not a word of apology. It was I guess a higher rank manager came and say he will change a new one for me.<br/>I appreciate the manager who said changing the dish for me but it's the attitude of the manager in blue coat giving a super unhappy face and furiously ask the staff the clear the "contaminated" dish. It appear to be my fault to ask them change.<br/>Super poor attitude from that manager
5
Had a dinner here today and was my first visit. There was promotion for the Peking Duck and Suckling pig. We took the opportunity to order them and were pleased that they were good and not sub standard because of promotion. We also had Coffee Ribs which taste equally good. It is definitely a worthwhile visit.PS : the car park for Odeon Building is not too big so it is advisable to come earlier if you are having dinner here
5
I went with a friend who made the choices - all excellent. My friend may get some credit but most must go to the chef.Very attentive staff. I'm sure they'd have helped with decisions had I been alone. Relatively formal but I was dressed casually and didn't feel uncomfortable.
2
This grand old dame has seen better daysFormerly a doyen of traditional (i mean traditional, not pedestrian) cantonese cuisine that excelled in catering to the old rich, the restaurant retains some of its old skills but sadly has failed to keep upSunday nights will see old faithful customers reminiscing with old friends and multi generational customers, and the odd tourist that stumbled unwittingly in due to its location opposite Raffles City Swissotel and the areaAmbience - averagePrice - way above norm About $100pp without drinks (tea only)Quality of food - hit and miss, mostly average compared to its peersObliging service staf
3
Came here for a business lunch and we had dim sum. Found the food to be decent but not especially outstanding.
4
Must order dish: Peking duck (need to order one day in advance), pricy yet very delicious, portion is suitable for 5-6ppl!!! steam Bamboo clams and fried thousand aged eggs are also good dishes...busy restaurant, expect delays in serving the dishes
4
Been here a few times for lunch. Easily accessible from City Hall mrt. Good selection of dim sum at reasonable prices. Food has been consistently decent on my visits.
3
Attracts a lot of business meetings due to its location. Food is quite decent i.e. above averge but given the price (high side) and average ambiance and service, I wouldn't make this my favourite makan place; but still worthy of my consideration.
1
Large place with old fashioned dÃ©cor. Lots of workers around but none seemed to speak English, although English is the official language in Singapore (it was later explained to us that many places use workers from mainland China who do not speak English, for cheap labor). We were the only non-Asians in the room that evening... and we had a miserable dining experience. First of all, the service was bordering on hostile, certainly inattentive and non-interested. As to the food this caveat: the menu is huge, pages and pages with little explanation or even pictures of the dishes in English - we can only review the dishes we ate and those are the worst Chinese dishes we ever ate anywhere, period. The 'Melon Soup with Seafood' consisted of a few tiny chunks of unidentifiable seafood floating in some thin liquid (to call it broth would be insulting what broth is) of no taste, all topped with a chunk of some melon, also with no flavor. Just terrible. The 'Soup with Prawns' main dish consisted of the same utterly flavorless broth this time with noodles and two (count them: 2) so-called "prawns" ("so-called" because they really were just two medium size shrimps). Truly terrible again. My wife had the sweet and sour pork ($24.00 !) which was a totally ordinary tasting small portion and - to our utter amazement - NO RICE on the side. Talk about chintzy! Our advice: avoid this place!
5
Finally had dim sum lunch at Asia Grand last Saturday. For the price we paid, it is seriously value for money.The Siew Mai was out of this world and the Baked Char Siew Bao can seriously rival Tim Ho Wan.With the decor and service, I thought I was having Dim Sum in Hong Kong. Spent $26 per pax
2
We were here as a business group and a previous patron took us all here raving about the food. He ordered a very major and extensive traditional meal that had several courses. The duck is in 2 courses, then a chicken, suckling pig and also a fish course. The duck was overcooked, the roast pig was like chewing on my leather shoes, and the chicken was boiled way too long. The fish was the best option to eat. The flavors of the meal were ok, but not the best I've had. Maybe it was a bad meal as I know it does have a better reputation from others.The service was stellar, I can't fault them at that. They were really accommodating.Decor is okay, a bit basic, not too much atmosphere. Restrooms were ok but not the cleanliest for what was supposed to be a nicer restaurant
5
Asia Grand is one of my frequent visits while I am in Singapore. I love the feel of the resturant, fresh fish tanks, grand chandeliers. It is most authentic and serves mostly Asian customers. The staff is very friendly and the meals are authentic and delicious. I love the soups, duck, pork and bamboo clams! They take care of you and see that you are pleased with their service and food. Visit on holidays with a reservation, but otherwise walkins are ok
5
This restaurant by far offers the best service I came across - the staff were friendly, active and had a good sense of humor. I was also very pleased by the food, especially the roast pork belly and peking duck which was extremely crispy yet flavorful. Despite that, the ambience failed my expectations as there was lack of music, due to the fact that the restaurant was loud. Although the prices were rather extravagant and costly, the food was very worth the price. This restaurant is a definite must-go
5
The Asia Grand is my favourite Singapore restaurant. I have dined here at least 10 times over the 7 years visiting Singapore from Australia. Food is excellent and this visit had even improved. The Xiao Long Bao previously were just ok. This time there were very good, a vast improvement. Plenty of choices for Yum Cha and the service from the staff very attentive
5
Lunch here was great. Dim sum delicious. Loved the pork crackle. Prices very reasonable and fast efficient service. Staff will give recommendations. They know what they are talking about. Definitely worth a visit!

Family dinner at Asia Grand restaurant. Setting was nice, got ourselves a large table for more than 10 guests, chandeliers brightly lit up the restaurant. Despite all these, we did feel relaxed, the service was generally good that night. Or at least at the very beginning.Had a whole Peking duck and a whole roasted suckling pig. Yes, they both impressed us, especially the sucking pig. As for the second course of the Peking duck, the meat was flavoursome, albeit being dry and hard. But we were able to chew.What we didn't like was the steamed chicken with yunnam ham. The chicken meat was rather tasteless and the yun nam ham tasted rubbery. This, chewing did not help.The steamed Ba Ding fish (aka catfish) was served 90% cooked. The younger folks were fine with that, but not the older ones. What the waitress did was to keep basting the warm soya sauce over the fish again and again, right in front of us. We wondered if that was normal practice.Generally the meal was great. Service was declining as the restaurant got busier. For instance, there was this big-sized chinese waiter with black frames, he served food to us but made a slight mess on the guests, i.e. gravy falling on another guest's plate and cutlery. No apologies were heard and the 'cannot-be-bothered' attitude was what lingered in our memory and prevented us from giving this restaurant 4 stars.Date: 06 Oct 201

We went for an impromptu dim sum lunch on a Sunday afternoon. They have quite a variety of dim sum selection and ala carte menu was also available. Orderd a few of the standard dim sum items eg ( siew Mai, rice roll with preserved egg and chicken, steam pork ribs, deep fried mango roll with prawns, carrot cake plus two lean meat preserved egg porridge ) all did not disappoint. In addition, we also ordered the roasted pork $12 per portion and the skin was crispy and comes with the wasabi dip. This was good. The peking duck was also on promotion per table basis at only $38++ . This is a little out of standard though as we feel that the skin is not crispy enough for our liking! However at only $38++ it was quite a steal! You can also stir fried the meat with noodle or rice for an extra cost. The service was very attentive and personalized. Overall, it certainly not a very cheap place for lunch but with the service provided and the excellent food, wouldn't mind paying a bit more

Decided to try this place out after a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. The restaurant is walking distance from the Burgis train station. We had the Peking Duck and it was expertly sliced with only the crispy skin, leaving the meat intact for a second course. We also tried the Abalone and the 2X cooked winter mellon seafood soup and both were also very good. The staff was very attentive and not intrusive at all. The anticipated our needs and were quick to meet them. They changed the wet towel without us even asking and would clear the dirty dishes and replace them with clean ones, no waiting needed.An excellent restaurant experience

An elegant place for Cantonese fine dinning. The food, ambience and service reminisces dinning in Hong Kong. Be prepared to pay at lease S$50 per head for a simple meal, and S$100++ for a satisfying dinner. For example a simple and small bowl of Wonton (shrimp dumpling) noodle is S$13, and besides 10% service and 7% GST, there is another 8 to 10% hinder cost on pickles and tea. But the food is excellent, and service is attentive. Great place for excellent dim sum and special family celebrations

This is our favorite dim sum restaurant, and the Peking duck has to rank as one of the best we've had. You can see the juices flowing when the Peking duck skin is being sliced, which is itself incredibly crispy. And to cap it all the staff are excellent!

Earlier this month i visted the Asia Grand in Singapore with my Singaporean friends Richard and Siew leng and the choice of venu for our meal was first class.The Restaurant is full of charactrs in their staff and in particular the General Manager a lady called Shirley Ng who was extremely friendly and knowlegable as to what we should chose to eat.The boss man is Peter and again he made you feel welcome rather than just as a customer.The selection of dishes is amazing and Shirley was extremely helpful in assisting us to chose the right food..The food is not cheap but then again i do not consider it overpriced either as the quality and presentaion was superb.I really like this place as it also serves Durian pudding which is not to everyone taste but was very good.If anyone is in this vicinity during your stay in Singapore i would highly recommend this place.Well done to all the staff for your professionalism and friendliness and i will be back when i am next in Singapore in the not to distant future.Stewart DavisGlasagow,Scotland

A big classic Chinese restaurant: great food, great mood, noise, life, as you have in Asia.Elderly people, families with young kids, romantic couples, ... This place welcomes all kind of customers and that leads to a specific atmosphere!Many great dishes, from the duck served in small pancakes to vegetables, spicy beef, ...A place to go in Singapore to be sure eating great Chinese food..

The Good =)~Cantonese food, not only high quality, but also uses fresh ingredients.~Service is very warm.The Bad =(~No credit card discount.~During peak times, may have to wait longer because the kitchen is unable to cope with the huge demands of orders.My Tip for future visits:~Book early, if not if there are fully booked, you will not be given a table reservation

We took a chance and went without reservations and since it was early and a weekday, were able to get a table. First time in this place and its your typical Chinese restaurant. We ordered the usual fares of dimsum: hakaw, pork suimai and they were all tasty. The carrot cake was delicious. The disappointing dish was the roast pork -- it had a certain smell and taste from pork that is not so fresh. So I don't understand the hype -- it's good but not fantastic. My friend says that on weekends, they push you to finish your dining in 45mins
5
We tried a number of dishes and all were very good. The food was fresh and the staff was very friendly. We were there on a Tuesday night and it was busy and thus it can get a bit noisy.
4
Amazing service, food was good and the amount of food was more than enough. we could have shared one meal between us. The food was good but the service was the best part of our experience and we felt welcome.
5
The place is fully priced, and the dishes appear pretty unassuming but the taste is amazing. We had the sweet and sour pork, butter prawns and veggies+mushrooms hotpot and couldn't fault a single dish. Will definitely be going back next trip to Singapore.

We recently had a gathering at this restaurant located at North Bridge road, it was my first time here despite having driven past it countless times. As it was a lunch gathering, we tried their dim sum menu and we were pleased with the varieties of dim sum available including the standard har know, siew mai, roasted pork buns both steamed and fried. Quality of the food was very good . Service was efficient and friendly, and the waitress were eager to refill our tea cups. One of the more memorable dish is the Peking duck which was very crispy and the accompanying onion and cucumber provided an excellent combination of textures and flavours. Definitely one of the better Peking duck dishes I have tried. Highly recommended .We spend about $160 for 4 adults and 5 kids

I used to think that Peking duck was always wrapped with cucumber and spring onion as a completed dish but Asia Grand proved me wrong last night that I have to pay $3++ for spring onion. I didn't ask for extra, they rather only wrapped each the peking duck skin with only cucumber and only provided us only 4 pieces of 'spring onion' out of the 20 wraps. There were exactly 4 of us and 4 pieces of spring onion. Well, I wouldn't expected much from some other maybe sze char stalls to complete the dish with adequate amount of ingredient but Asia Grand which we didn't pay any less, we paid $360 and I don't think asking adequate spring onion was too much. I wonder how many pieces of spring onion will they give for the additional $3++...

We were very impressed with Asia Grand Cantonese restaurant because the food came quickly, there was good variety on the menu, it was quite delicious, and the prices were more than competitive. I was just recovering from food poisoning (from another restaurant), so I accompanied my wife at lunch time, not intending to eat. She said the corn and crab soup was excellent, as were the roast pork belly and the sesame dumplings. Even though I was recovering, I just had to place an order for the fried mantou (three pieces to an order). It was just what I needed. My wife's fresh orange juice was as good as at other Cantonese restaurants that we have visited, and it was less expensive. We recommend Asia Grand for speed and accuracy of service, taste, and price. The atmosphere was typical Cantonese restaurant atmosphere. We regret only that we have just now discovered it after many visits to various Cantonese restaurants in Singapore

We wanted to try the new Michelin starred dim sum restaurant in plaza Singapura but the Q went around the corner! Asia Grand was our plan B. Typical dim sum "dÃ©cor" white ceiling and gold Louis 16 beading and psychedelic carpet and table cloth. Dim Sum it self was very acceptable, service from the old aunties friendly. We were told they had the old fashion trolleys but on our visit didn't see any. We normally go to Lei Gardens in Chimes or Ritz Carlton for Dimsum which is a bit more upmarket in decor and price! Would I go back? Only if all the other places are full or I am on a budget

Owned by Hong Kongers, this place serve a fantastic medley of Cantonese dishes with a dash of other dishes from other parts of china, which is of course Hong Kong style, not to be confused with gangan style which is an excellent dance but I have never been convinced by the cuisine! The service is immaculate, we had far too much food for 4 people and lunch came to 250 sing which was expensive but the food was worth every penny. I really enjoyed this place, the highlights being the dim sum and the little fish which tasted like crisps.Great place

As a native New Yorker, I have had my fair share of excellent dim sum. Asia Grand's offerings rival those in New York. The "carrot cake" with XO sauce was tasty. If you're adventurous, try the fried fish skin. They're like fancy shrimp chips! The shrimp dumplings are as fresh and snappy as they get. Also the pork knuckles in wine vinegar and ginger is very authentic and delicious. However, the service we received is what made the whole experience so enjoyable. The waitstaff were extremely attentive and warm, helping us choose dishes that made for a well balanced meal

Located across from Raffles Hotel and next to Carlton, this unassuming place looked the typical Chinese restaurant - homey and welcoming for family dining, yet enough posh for business patrons. Service was excellent - a dedicated waitress throughout the night, the GM and CEO even popped by occasionally to check on us. I reckon it's cos our host is a regular. Before we started on the mains, the table was filled with appetisers - octopus flavoured with salted duck yoke batter was yummy. The Peking duck in all its glory was carved at table side, served in rolled Mandarin pancakes with crackers. Pork rib & watercress soup, rib roast with black pepper sauce (carved to show ultimate juiciness), roasted boneless chicken stuffed with glutinous rice (tad dry cos chook was slightly small to fit our table ie. less fat to drip through the rice stuffing), fresh egg noodles with XO sauce.. Dishes came one after another and I lost track after a while. Coupled with wine & drinks and changes in tea, it was a fantastic culinary experience. Altho' we were the last to leave, none of the staff gave us ugly looks. Can't really comment on cost as we didn't pick up the tab

For lunch, try dim sum and peking duck. They are excellent and good value for money.

I brought my grandmother for a dim sum lunch here. As the location is centralised, its easy to flag a cab. Staff are friendly and not too intrusive. Food is rather good and there was an amex discount when I was eating there today.

Peking Duck offer at $33/duck.
Very affordable.
Meat can be served as minced salad or duck noodles.
Great tim sum.

After few years trying to find a nice Dim Sum place to eat, we finally found it. Located across Raffles Hotel, big and welcoming place. Perfect for lunch and probably very good for dinner. Staff is kind and helpful, efficient. Strongly recommend.

hong kong style tim sum

This is one of the best restaurants for Peking duck and Dim sum in Singapore IMHO.Very good staff , top quality food. Excellent Soup dumplings , Roasted Pork , Duck...Never had a bad dish here and at very good prices.Must have been here at least 5 times , never disappoints

Came here for a dinner with friends and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and the service was very good - Cantonese style. Friendly and knowledgeable yet humble. Quite refreshing for Singapore where good service is hard to come by. The peking duck (SGD 39) was excellent as was the suckling pig (SGD 80 for half), both on special promotion. The hot and sour soup had a good balance. Dimsum is also meant to be good here

Except for its 流沙包 (custard egg yolk bun), all other dishes managed to meet our expectations with its fine dimsum served. For a slightly more authentic touch, some of the senior service staff speak Cantonese as their mother tongue, feeling as though we're back in Hong Kong. Charsiew-sou ($4.00)Some of my friends say this is a staple for all dimsum meals. I'm not a fan of charsiew, so I can't offer my take on this. It has managed to satisfy my two other picky friends' tastebuds though, so I reckon this is above average and worth a shot!Egg tarts ($4.00)Bite-sized egg tarts with flaky crust, this is my favourite serving style. With its warm fillings and soft tender egg curd, it was goodness encapsulated in a mouthful. I liked how the crust wasn't too thick and complemented the curd well. The fillings were also rich and not overly sweet. Verdict: 8.0/10Hargao ($5.20)As you might know if you've read my previous reviews, hargao is my staple at any dimsum places I go to. This hasn't disappointed at all. The prawns used inside were fresh and had a natural sweetness to it, unlike the crunchy processed prawns that some places use. The dumpling skin was thin enough to keep the fillings wrapped yet doesn't fall apart upon your first bite, nor does it stick to your teeth. Have it while it's hot though, while the skin is soft and slightly chewy. Verdict: 9.0/10Chee Cheong Fun with Prawns ($5.80)This was perhaps the only other dish besides its 流沙包 (custard egg yolk bun) that didn't quite impress. I thought the 'fun' was a tad too thick and the sauce had a slight peanut taste to it that didn't quite sit well with me. It wasn't too bad, just a matter of preference I guess. There was quite a generous serving of prawns in it, I would have liked it better if the 'fun' was much thinner and smoother. One of my favourites is the scallops rendition from Royal China, right opposite Asia Grand. Verdict: 6.5/10流沙包 (custard egg yolk bun) ($4.20)It was quite an interesting presentation and we thought we ordered some fanciful dish without us knowing. The death sentence is always pronounced, at least to me, when you peel open so cautiously to realise it doesn't flow at all. The fillings weren't well mixed, it had a much higher proportion of egg yolk and I couldn't really taste the slight sweetness of the custard in it. There was also an odd aftertaste that was kinda familiar, yet a first to appear in 流沙包. We couldn't quite figure out what that was, but it didn't enhance the dish for sure. The brown swirls didn't have any taste to it, quite deceiving as I thought there would be some special flavour to it. I didn't quite like the bun too, it was a bit too thick, and it had a loose airy texture that made it rougher than the usual. Verdict: 5.0/10Siew Mai ($4.80)An ordinary looking dish but managed to impress quite a bit! For a start, there's real fish roe toppings. The fillings were very fresh and juicy, with tender meat and prawn chunks, and I like how it was different from usual siew mai, with a stronger mushroom taste in it. It added a unique fragrance to the dish and wasn't just the normal 'boring' siew mai. It would have been better if there was just a little less skin though. But that's just me being a little picky, as the excess at the edges bothered me a little, tasting some parts with just skin. Verdict: 8.0/10Shrimp Roll with Mango ($5.20)This reminded me of the wonderfully addictive dish at Kow Loon Tim Sum. This wasn't quite well done though, the mango and prawn pieces felt like two distinct dishes instead of a complement to each other. The type of mango chosen wasn't perfect for this, it wasn't ripe and sweet enough to melt in your mouth and add on to the sweetness of the prawns. Fresh prawns used and I liked the crunch and flavour of the sesame coated skin nonetheless. Verdict: 6.0/10Fried Pork Dumpling ($4.20)Pan fried to a nice golden brown (albeit abit oily), this is perhaps the best part of any gyozas to give that extra crisp. It could have been crispier, as this one with juicy meat packed inside felt more like a xiaolongbao. The skin was also a tad too thick, but I liked the tasty fillings inside. Verdict: 7.0/10Beef Balls ($4.20)This is supposed to be a seasonal dish, and we were surprised by the huge serving size. The meat was succulent and had a slight chew to it. It had a very homemade touch to it with the irregular edges. A personal preference though, I didn't quite like the strong taste of vegetables and spring onions in it. Quite a recommended dish if you like vegetables!Verdict: 7.5/10It was a very warm and cosy setting, felt very family-like and I would probably bring my family here for dimsum next time. The dishes were all very finely done and lived up to our expectations in general. It quite matched up to Royal China, in my opinion, as I like different dishes in both places. Seems like they're also famous for their Peking duck, tempting to go back for a taste of it!For full review and pictures, visit http://makeyourcaloriescount.blogspot.sg/2012/08/sg-asia-grand-restaurant.htm

Asia Grand is 'Old School' dining. Its not hip, funky, or trendy. What it gives is some of the most professional service in a restaurant anywhere. Every waiter, in fact all staff treat their diners with such courteous professionalism. Their dim sum menu is excellent. Old favourites and served beautifully and hot! The tea service is exceptional too. My favourite is the Pur err. Peking Duck is delicious and well serve. Whenever I am in Singapore I dine here. It must have been my 8th time recently

I tried this restuarant as family members in Singapore told me this was award winning. The ambience was very good and looks the part - upmarket and classy. The food was almost french cuisine Asian style, small portions, cute and delicate.I left it my my local guide to order. The food was nice and tasty but I found them a little too salty for my liking. We stayed for about 2 hours through lunch and sampled a lot of dishes and dim sums as well. However, about an hour after lunch I felt the onset of Chinese Restaurant Symdrome and I suspect its got to do with the flavour enhancers they use. Well, it may be highly rated, but I won't be queing to get in
