I've visited this place several times. It's so crowded during lunch/dinner time. The dish I always love is hokkien mee and also their bakut teh. The bakut teh is typical Malaysian bakut teh, different with Singapore bakut teh.

I don't feel food is so tasty here... Crowded... Little expensive...
Chendol here is gud but they gave very small amnt ... It's better to eat in kopitiam than here
4
Food taste like you are in Malaysia. Very authentic Malaysia style and food are good. Price reasonable but waiting queue a bit long.
Thumb up for the Char Kway Teow ðŸ–’
5
U can get all sorts of delicious Malaysian food here!
My favorite is fried kway teow, which always has very long queue.
Other foods include- fried oysters, assam laksa, curry chicken mee, chendol, bak kut teh, pancake.
Yum yum!

Had 2 plates of char kway teow and ahpong! It was amazing and authentic! Also had a dish of Malaysian wanton mee!

Firstly , i m ipoh mali with penang relatives so that qualifies me (tasted best hawker food in malaysia) to comment on the quality of food here firstly true blue malaysians will not give the food here 4 stars - only people from Spore/johore/pahang dan lain lain (but not Kl/pj, ipoh, penang folksï¼‰ will rate this as very good ! i m benchmarking it against the good ones in the citiesif you cannot go to penang , then head to Lot 10 Hutong , KL to sample not the best but subsidiaries of the best hawkers in Kl be it cKT , minced beef & ball soup noodles , etc Malaysia Bolih is a pretender ! not great but passable ! i will come here if only in Boon La

I am Malaysian and from Penang. I have been eating Char Kway Teow (CKT) for a long time and I can said that I grow with this dish.So when I am at Singapore, hunt for a CKT every where. Eventually found this, I have to say itâ€™s 90% similar taste as the one I eat at Penang.I strongly recommend and will be back there again
4
We have not been to this part of Singapore and Malaysia Boleh is already there more than a year.A little bit crowded on a Saturday noon and we decided to focus the better stalls first...Penang Char Kway Teow was as good as what we have eaten in Singapore.Chendol was really good too but in a smaller bowl. Teh Tarlik was so so....We will visit this place again to taste other stalls
5
The stall is always crowded and waiting time is at least 30 minutes! However it's worth the wait as the food is delicious. The Char Kway Teow is prepared with precision where the Kway Teow is weighed and there is no variation allowed like requesting for more or less ingredients.This place is always crowded and finding a place can be challenging at times. My Favourite is the Char Kway Teow and the Appom. I tried Claypot rice recently and that's good too

They have a good spread of Malaysian street food. For those who are not familiar, please see what you are buying before you commit. Hokkien noodles isn't our "prawn noodle" type. Chicken rice is plan and not as fragrant as the Hainanese version we have. Bak Kut Teh is the herbal and not the plain peppery version. Even wantan noodles are black sauce and not tomato based. So be warned.
3
Food not too bad but a bit expensive. Environment no good. Always crowded and noisy. Only suitable for eat and go, you hardly could sit longer as many people standing beside your table waiting for the seats :(
4
You are spoiled with food choices in Malaysia Boleh!
Very good quality food for about $5 dollars.
At times it could be bit busy.
You won't be disappointed with the food in Malaysia Boleh!

Good place to eat cheap and tasty Char Siew buns, this time we went to the IMM-branch. Also try the fried oyster omelett or claypot chicken rice.
5
A really good place for many and located in Jurong Point in th west.Must come here early before the lunch or dinner crowds otherwise it could be a long wait at certain stalls or a complete turn off as seats are limited.Our favorites :Fried kway teow (always long queue)Bak kut tehClaypot riceChendolKueh stall right at the entry of the hawker centr

I have heard about this Malaysian food street for some time and decided to drop by to check it out! Was pleasantly surprised with the scale as there are more than ten stalls featuring different famous Malaysian food. Ordered the wanton mee and was brought back to my childhood after tasting it. It's exactly how it was tasted 30 years ago!Another thing worth mentioning is the prices of the food, it's very economical, even similar to the prices you will get at hawker centre. Had a cup of kopi o at $1 only! Amazing...There's another Malaysia food street RWS and I can assure you that this place is so much better than that one in terms of food and prices
4
Great take on the modern hawker center. Good value for money too. Seating can get tricky to find during peak hours. The â€˜da baoâ€™ aka pork bun was good and filling. Especially enjoyed the boiled egg inside. Oyster omlette is a hit or miss. Wonton soup was average. The chicken claypot rice was pretty good. Could have some trouble getting around if new to the food and/or donâ€™t know Mandarin
3
food is just wonderful and apparently not much flaws either, but the crowd is still overwhelming. Should try out the desserts and street food located at the entrance as they sell a lot of traditional desserts, once again i shall say that the food is just wonderful and i recommend that people should come but be mindful of the lengthy queue
4
Can try out the Penang asam laksa, chendol , and Claypot chicken rice. This three food are worth trying. As for the char kuey tiaw, don't have to que up since the taste is average unless you miss Malaysia char kuey tiaw then can give it try to kill the craving.
4
Went to the food court as I've some cravings for oyster omelette and prawn noodles. I must say the fried oyster omelette is really nice and the prawn noddles is not bad too. I quite like the traditional rickshaw noodles which can't be found easily anywhere now. The drawback is... There's stairs to more seats above and if u bring a baby pram etc it won't be convenient for u to go to the upper seats if the seats below are filled!

I avoided this venue due to how crowded it usually is. However, noticing 'Pasembur'(!) and crispy 'Ban Chiang Kuih(!), I made a resolution to drop by with much success today. Tried the 'Asam Laksa' (small, $4), 'Klang Bak Kut Teh'($5.50), 'Pasembur'($6 - cucur udang, crispy prawn fritters and deep fried squid). The least authentic would be the Pasembur but, at least it gave a resemblance of the nutty sauce reminiscent of the KL ones. Overall, a rare, happy find in Sg. Will be back for more
4
They offered a variety of Malaysian hiker food, such as penang fried mee, assam laksa, bahkuteh and some dessert such as chendol

I am Malaysian and was craving for some cendol - someone suggested this place. The first time I went was around 7:30pm on a Sunday and it was packed with people. I left and went back few days later on a weekday around 6pm and there was just a handful of crowd. I ordered cendol, prawn mee, and hokkien mee. The taste is not quite like home but not bad.I would highly recommend going on a weekday just because there would be less of a queue

Sorry guys... (for the title) but the food is genuinely good. Well, not ALL the stalls but most of them are good. And very reasonably priced. In a matter of 2 months, I have been here 4 times!Whats good so far: CHENDOL!! To die for.... 10/10The only BAD thing about it - they don't do takeaway. The herbal BahkutTeh - so so. 7/10The Curry Noodles - FANTASTIC 9/10Claypot rice - YUMMMY!!! 9.5/10The oyster omelette - nah! overated and too oily and 20-minute wait 4/10Chicken rice - good 8/10The dessert stall - apom and the pancake - NICE!! 9/10(this one can dabao)Be warned -- it can get quite crowded here! Well, ok, I have shared my secret place now.... so, enjoy!

We like the variety of Malaysian street food available here. We tried the pork rib soup, the cuttlefish kangkong salad, the chicken rice-noodles and chendol (dessert). All done simply but full of flavors. The prices are on par with those in the Singapore Food Courts. Good place to try out the Malaysian street food. Will visit again.

If you are Malaysian work in Singapore , or been in Malaysia for holiday , and crazy of the Malaysian Food. You Must try the food here.Located at JP2 Level 2 beside Dian Xiao Er. hahahahHot Pot chicken rice only 5 dollar, no Service tax. Oyster omelet also recommend.

The rojak sauce nice.Dollar Save and no Service tax to pay

If you are looking for Malaysia's famous food, you can find them all in one food court located at Jurong Point Shopping mall 2, Level 2, Malaysia Boleh. There are different stalls selling different types of famous Malaysia Food. Some of my fav food would be the wantan mee and Chendol. Overall the food is not as authentic in Malaysia, but still it's still not too bad either as you won't have to travel to Malaysia to enjoy these food. The cleaning service of this food court is very efficient. Price wise is acceptable. A must visit for Malaysia food lovers :

Malaysia boleh is one of my favourite place but what i cant tolerance is one of woman worker who is very rude n bad attitude towards customer. This aunty is in charger of the pork noodles n fried egg oyster stall. She has no rights to treat her customer like we own her n if u cant wait dont eat please go. I dont know her name but she is plumb n short hair n voice damn loud. She only handle cashes n food preparation. Hope the boss or owner of Malaysia boleh can look into this asap, else i believed u will lost more customers

Firstly, nothing beats having the authentic stuff from there. If you miss the foods, this Malaysia Boleh can satisfy your craving. It is charged in Singapore Dollars, so don't do the RM conversion and suffer a heart pain. The foods are quite a decent substitute, considering certain ingredients are not available here, such as the bee hoon used for Penang Laksa. I have given up on the char kuey teow. The last 2 times, they were a disappointment. Why? They were not spicy at all, too salty, and no wok hei taste. I guess it depends on who fries it well. In the beginning, Malaysia Boleh foods were really good, but lately, the standards have shot down. Please also don't waste your good money on the popiah. It is badly wrapped, soggy and hardly any taste.  Do try the mata kuching drink, you just can't miss it. It's at the entrance.Selamat Makan

No offense to Singaporeans, the food here if rated by Malaysians would be average or below average/failed!!The koay teow being mass produced is bland n oily, asam laksa has not enough mackerel, prawn mee not the right kind of chilli you can add into the soup.The Ipoh ho fun is below par. Wantan mee average.The apom is not bad but you need to go pulau tikus in penang to get the real deal.Not that bad but if people think this is very good malaysian food, no problem, its not a rip off but the best they can is no substitute for pure hawkers food in penang. If i was a malaysian i would head off to Maxwell market for chicken rice than eat chow koay teow here

It located in west of Singapore in Jurong point shopping centre. Of course, price is higher than selling in Malaysia. The longest querue is the "Penang fried Kway Tiao". .. not bad! Claypot rice is above average in Sinagpore and Bak Ku Teh is tasty (But with MSG) , hokkien prawn noodle is good but I prefer the taste eating in KL , fried oyster taste is different from Singapore and too small plate. Normally, Lunch and dinner are very difficult to find a seat. May be the space is too small. Overall, you can find good food with quite a high standard Malaysian food in Singapore! Yummy
