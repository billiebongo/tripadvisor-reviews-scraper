I've stayed here for 4 nights. Same standard breakfast everyday. Staffs are friendly but a bit "don't care" about guests much. Everything is just ok here anyways.

A very rich buffet with a varied choice of protein, veggies, desserts and in all more choices than we could cover. Delicious, actually.

Everything was fine. Food and drink a little expensive. Coffee average.
The cafe was nice nut expensive, better to eat out at the local cafes

In the competitive F&B scene in Singapore, the Nonya buffet stood the test of time and maintain its high quality over the decades. Well-made and good range of Nonya dishes. Bon appetite

Stayed here for an in-house conference for 4 days. Hotel is located metres from the Singapore river making easy access to restaurants and exercise. Walking distance to Clark's Quay. Extensive Singaporean and Malaysian buffet daily at breakfast and lunch. The hotel also has a Chinese restaurant.Wifi was reliable and fast. Un-heated pool located outside with a sauna is well kept. There is a small but practical gym located on the second floor. The rooms are modern, clean and with all essentials. Only disappointment was that I had booked a room with a large bed and instead was given a room with two single beds. This was rectified after 24 hours, however the large bed offered was two single beds pushed together...Concierge service is proactive and helpful. Easy access to taxis from the hotel. Good for business and conferences but too far from downtown to be a choice for a touristic stay.

we were only at the Copthorn Kings for 1 night and were "upgraded" to a room on the 3rd floor (310) next to the elevators. I was a bit worried for a minute about the elevator noise, which it turns out we couldn't hear at all, and then being on the same level as the pool deck and pool pumps, We could hear the pumps for the pool for a while and then they went off at about 10.30pm. So we had a great sleep, the bed was comfortable the room was spacious and the pool area was nice. We walked over the overpass to Robertson Quay for coffee, there doesn't appear to be much around this area. Like others have said you have the use of a smart phone which is in your room, for the duration of your stay, which was very handy, I have never come across that before. Nothing wrong with this hotel but I have stayed nearer to Chinatown and on Beach rd near Haji lane and I think I prefer those areas

We went with a group of 24 as a business trip for 5 days.We didn't stay at the hotel much but I would say we had a very present stay, staff was helpful and flexible and the breakfast buffet had variety of food .This place is just walking distance to Chinatown and some other shopping destinations around the corner.Easy access to bus stops and food courts etc

Fairly large rooms is a clear advantage. This hotel is clean, comfortable and conveniently located on main arterial Havelock road. The price offered is good. Though while making reservations do ask for rooms on the higher floors and rooms facing the road for better views. Some rooms to the rear overlook service areas and are disappointing. The breakfast offered is sumptuous and variety is good with a mix of Chinese and hot continental buffet with a good choice

+ve : location, structure of building, inside atmosphre & look. Very well cooperative reception area & reception staff.-ve : staff are not able to communicate in english except reception area, Pathetic daily room service need to followup behind them for small things like teabags, sugar, etc.Air condition system in room was hopeless it was getting cut off at any time in night & after calling reception they sent engineer which is 24 by 7 available for maintenance which is useless stuff. As nobody will sacrifice their sweet sleep for AC maintainance.We were staying in Room No 906, size of bath room was very very small, very difficult to manage to use. Bath tub is provided which is also tiny & only option for bath. Bathroom is particulary to be check for size & other things if someone wants to check in.Restaurant area is maintained well in manner but staff are headaches they not at all understand english, very difficult to manage with them & their attitudes too.We didn't had lunch dinner over here as not felt to had its like that.I found oveall this hotel was not upto the standards as per tariffs charged, not worth to stay here

Old hotels in Singapore has 1 good feature, if nothing else. Space. Copthorn King is not in the city, centre, and not new. Thus the price is good. It is convenient in Singapore with public transport and taxi, thus no issue in getting around. Besides, there is hotel shuttle!Stayed there several times for gathering with school mates and friends. Wonderful place to be

The food was good and plentiful the restaurant was very busy so we did have wait awhile to be served but well worth the wait.

We were the only non asians at this buffet,but lots of people came up and described the food and told us to try many dishes.
We tried every thing except the pigs belly soup and stingray fillets !!

We had a meal here before an evening tour and were surprised with the choice of menu in a small restaurant.Staff were helpful and made us feel welcome. The food was cooked freshly and well.
4
Very generous with the buffet spread. Quality is great too.
Not to be miss one of the best buffet place in Singapore.
5
Excellent for dinner or cocktails by the river. Good quality but not inexpensive. River boats park and pick you up close to the hotel. Excellent location.

Very average hotel, typically Singapore-expensive for what you get. The rooms look like they've been renovated recently. Hall-ways have been tastefully redecorated as well, we stayed in room 1006.Bed- queensized and acceptably comfortable. Linen was ok.Room: reasonable size, with limited storage areas for clothing. Small Juliet balcony available if you sign waiver not to hurt yourself on it. Balcony did have rotten decking over the concrete pad base. View was out the back of the building, from level 10 was ok but I pity anyone closer to the huge air on units on the ground floor. Bathroom was tiny but adequate, good linen.Outside noise level was barely acceptable. Air con worked well and not too noisy.Check in process was ok, however despite our months-old booking they only had a smoking room available and so had to upgrade us as we refused to accept this. Checkin staff were competent, but lacking in any welcoming personality. Check out went smoothly and the hotel did kindly oblige with a 1 hr checkout extension request.Hotel is a little out of the way, but 15 min walk to the river side Quayside entertainment area is ok if it's not raining. There's no ATM inside or close to the hotel, with reception staff ridiculously recommending we walk 30 minutes to Chinatown for the closest machine.Breakfast was included in the room rate and was so bad we didn't have it after the first day.Unfortunately, in Singapore terms this hotel was reasonable value for money

Stayed here with my husband and 10 yr old daughter. The room was a good size with 2 double beds. Breakfast buffet was very good, with a wide selection, but sometimes had to wait for a table as very busy. Pool was small, but nice to relax in after a day sightseeing. The hotel is located a 15 minute walk from Chinatown and 10 minutes from Robertson Quay. Singapore is a nice place to visit, but we found it very expensive, which spoilt the holiday a bit. On average we paid anything from 60 - 90 pounds to eat out, and that was nothing fancy. Also beware of some of the taxi drivers who will tell you that attractions don't open till later and take you on a joy ride to expensive tailors, jewellers and shops

Copthorne King shady booking procedure and bad services. We try to book the 2014 mother days lunch at Tien Court. Apart from demanding full payment from us within 2 days, we are requiref to fax credit card authorisation letter over which is still not able to satisfy them. The hotel further demanded a photocopy of front and back credit card to be fax to them for verification. When the hotel is being questions by us on merchant procedure in gathering credit card details from customers and how they manage our photocopy credit card data, they are not able to give clear explanation of the procedure. They are basically collecting credit card data from customers for the sake of collection for their own interest but failing to put in risk management for mishandling of customers private information. We were extremely furious with their shady procedures and decide to cancel the booking. We will never visit Tien Court or bother to lunch there by their "famous" super chef that they are so proud of

My lunch buddies choose to dine at this restaurant today as we have a 50% discount voucher to use. It was a bad choice. Even after paying the bill with the 50% discount, we felt that the prices were high and the food serving was small, for example, the Szechuan chicken in dried chillies, came with few small pieces of chicken over a large portion of dried chillies and also small pieces of garoupa fillet in black bean sauce, overcooked vegetable and the worst desserts we have ever taken for a restaurant standard. I am sorry to say that this experience is not what we expected from a award-winning restaurant which was advertised. A better choice to dine will be the Princess Terrace at this same hotel serving good Penang Hawker fare

I arrived in the evening and thought I was placed in a non-smoking room. Tower section of the Hotel. I woke up at about 2.00 am feeling like I had smoked a cigar. I changed over to the main hotel and the room was absolutely lovely and no hint of cigarette or cigar smell permeating the air-conditioning system. This Hotel is a bit of walk to Clark Quay BUT the walk is fantastic, along the river where there are many bars and restaurants. I really loved staying at this Hotel
