Nice collagen broth in the hot pot and the sake taste great we recommend it to other light and not strong sake. Come earlier as the Q can be long need to wait at lease an hour to head in this restaurant.

Super delicious rich collagen soup.
Received a plate "Thank You" at the end of the dinner from the staff. Worth the wait.
5
We had their signature Beauty Collagen Hot Pot (Binji Nabe), the soup was special and delicious, perfect match with all types of vegetables
5
at first i was kinda skeptical bout having soup for dinner. But my boyfriend was like give it a try before judging. no idea what is this collagen soup about. once it melts woah . you will never had enough of the soup. whats good is you can request for soup top up . without extra charges. service was fast. I love the bacon wrap with rice. We didnt have to queue up cause we avoid the peak timing . so it was a decent and fullfilling dinner

Finally have chance to try this. Normally not in the mood for the queue so I am quite hesitate to visit the restaurant. Last few days finally tried it. Queue at least 30mins, and you have time limit for the food. Luckily we were the last batch so no pressure of time to finish it. Soup tasted nice and ingredients were fresh. The only thing is the price. I feel quite expensive for $25++ per pax where there isn’t much ingredients. There are fixed items and choose 2 from the list. That means not all you see in the pictures are included. So slightly disappointed on that. Tried some other side dishes too, all tasted average.
3
Cosy place but with limited seats so the time allocated for lunch is only 1 hour 10 minutes so the place is only suitable for quick bites and only enter when all your friends have arrived cos the clock starts to tick when one of you enter and the bill will be sent to your table when time is up to chase you out. The lunch set promotion @ $18++ includes the noodle soup (original or soya sauce flavour), a side dish and free-flowing of green tea. There is a choice of 3 types of noodles: beauty noodle made from paprika, white thin and thick noodles. The selection of side dishes includes Romaine lettuce salad, rice ball, potato fries. By ordering the set you can order the specialty dessert egg pudding at discounted rate of $4+
4
Managed to skip the queue by going there early. There were seats available and a brief look at the menu and we were ready to eat. The soup was thick and full of flavour. The space was a little bit cramped but sufficient to eat without bumping into strangers
4
Waiting for about an hour, I tried this restaurant as recommended by my relatives. The chicken pot was very good as well as the beef (additional order).Staff served well and very responsive.Just a bit expensive for the beef. It's even more expensive than the original chicken pot set
4
Ladies simply love the idea of having collagen broth in the name of beauty. We want to believe that even as we enjoy a gigantic bowl of Japanese ramen swirling in a delicious stock packed with wonderful ingredients, we are simultaneously being nourished and are preserving our youth or getting younger by the day as we slurp away. Who are we kidding, right? But take my word for it. Even if we don't arrest the aging process, it is worth it! It's just sooooo yummy! Go, go, go! (But remember this isn't a cheap bowl of noodles...it's at least S$28/£15/USD20 per bowl!

Came here with 3 adults and 1 toddler. Always prefered the one at Chinatown and it was more spacious but we were near PS thus came here.We were here at around 5pm plus which was a wise choice as no reservation was allowed and usually there would be a long queue during meal time.We were ambitious and went ahead to order for 4 portions.In short, food was good but ended up being too much for 3 adults and 1 toddler. Amazing taste for the rice in the soup at the end.Nice jelly at the end of the meal which made the toddler literally ran back to rstn for more after we left the rstn.Thank you to the servers in giving her more jelly. Keep up the quality
5
the soup is very very tasty, and is supposed to be good for your skin! no wonder the long queue of ladies. no reservations allowed here though, hope they open more branches or increase the capacity soon.
4
Exceptional food presentation and good quality, excellent dining experience, friendly waitresses. No reservations taken. Be prepared to wait in line. Come as early as 5.30 to 6 pm to queue as the shop is small.
3
Queued almost 2 hours to get a table for 3pax. No reservation at this Plaza Singapura outlet.The collagen soup is good and tasty.However, the chicken pieces were a bit tough to eat. We would prefer them to be slightly more tender; as they were a bit difficult to detach from the bones.For SGD25++ per pax, the meal has more vegetables than meat.Each diner gets 2 chicken pieces, and 2 meat balls. Drinks are ordered separately.Food portion is rather small, given that each person is allocated one piece of each food item (fried bean curd, lady's finger, baby corn, etc).There is also a small plate of noodles to be shared and eaten with the soup.Go for the collagen soup if you have plenty of time to wait for a table.Service is good.We were pleasantly surprised with a thank you note written (with chocolate paste) on a plate

I was curious about the collagen soup that I see being posted by my Singaporean friends, so decided to try out this restaurant when I visited Singapore in November.The atmosphere in this restaurant is similar to the Izakayas here in Toronto. When you enter and exit, the staff acknowledge your presence by yelling welcome, thanks and bye in Japanese. (Or at least I think it's Japanese. =P) I have to admit that seeing the blobs of collagen (looking like fat/lard) dissolving into drinkable soup makes me feel a bit woozy, but I just had to try. Turns out the food is good, and the collagen soup tastes like chicken soup, not the greasy fat I had imagined. The service at the restaurant was good. We had a very nice waiter who was patient and attentive, and was even patient with me after I accidentally knocked my glass of diet coke over. The staff also brought a very nicely decorated dessert and sang a birthday song to help me celebrate my birthday.Overall, a great gastronomic experience, even though it is insane to be sitting in front of a bubbling hot pot in hot, humid Singapore
4
Not the first time here but always enjoyed the thick soup base. The food is not a lot but after drinking and drinking and drinking (the soup) the tummy just feels bloated.If you like thick soup based stuff, this is a good place for you :
4
Although some people claim that this chain of Bi Jin Nabe( Beauty HotPot). There is only one standard menu which per pax is $25++. But the amount is quite substantial for a lady. You can add in more of the ingredients at extra costs. The soup is amazing but to some people, it might be too salty. It is very thick and can see that there are a lot of collagen in it. You can refill one bowl of the soup, subsequent refills will be charged. Side DishesThe rice wrapped in Pork Slices, this is a must try. For the chicken karage, to speak the truth, I find it so so only. But the sauce is good. DrinksSho chu going at 9 bucks a glass, and also umeshu is 8 dollars. The beer is 9 dollars for 330ml. The queue is really crazy and try to get there early to avoid disappointment, I still find the store at Plaza Singapura still the best
2
The menu offers only limited choices of Ramen and it charges for extra noodle or broth, which is very unJapanese. The so called "beauty noodle" that is supposed to help moisturise the skin tastes no more than the home cooking chicken noodle soup. Not sure what is driving the hype and the premium price it commands ..
5
Rich creamy soup with fresh ingredients. Their side dishes you could order separately are delicious too. Staffs are very friendly and will explain and serve you if it is your 1st time there. You might have to queue for long if it is peak hours but it will be worth it
4
Arrived early on a weekday and waited less than 20mins to get a seat. The soup is really thick and tasty kinda like a cream based soup. Can be very heady if you take too much of it. The service is smooth and efficient with the server explaining to you the soup base, process of consuming the items served. Each person pays around $30 after taxes and service charge for the standard set meal. Pretty generous portions I must say.
5
There was a long queue of more than 20ppl ahead, waiting for the place to open at 5pm. It's worth the wait. The solid collagen melts in the pot as it is heated up, revealing the succulent and tender chicken within. Remove the chicken and you get an excellent broth to cook the remaining dishes. The experience is delightful and patrons might just get your dessert with a surprise of a personal touch!
4
be warned...u need wait 90-120 minutes , no booking allowed. Interesting experience seeing the 'collagen' melt and become soup.....waitress service are good. Am impressed with the dessert, they drew some cartoon similar to our faces on the plate....overall an interesting experience
5
The restaurant only offers Japanese noodles for lunch and steam boat for dinner. Their noodles were prepared in different way from others. I will be back there for dinner in future.

OMG I’m so suapakau when I first came here! I thought I was a but late, but, better late than never right? I went to Tsukada Nojo for lunch at first, but the place hadn’t opened yet, so I went back the day after tomorrow for dinner.I never know this place before and actually a man brought me out here for a lunch dinner date because I really love soup, like really lovee!!We went there on Saturday and the place was really crowded. We had to wait for almost two hours, err okay, maybe because it was weekend. The impatient me was so curious about the taste of this famous beauty collagen hotpot.Well, Tsukada Nojo is a Japanese restaurant specialty in beauty collagen stock. They are known for their Bijin Nabe (Beauty Collagen Hotpot).Why is it called Beauty Pot?Because you know, they said that drinking collagen soup will make you skin smooth and clean, makes you look beautiful, especially for the ladies. I bet lot of girls come here for this Taste : 9/10The soup is stewed for about 8 hours until the chicken bones are fully dissolved. The soup looks like pudding, or I think it’s more similar to 豆花 at first, then we just need heat it to wait till it melt fully and turned to collagen soup. Soup is rich and chicken is tender. The combination of fresh seafoods and vegetables with the soup is superb nice. There are quite lots of things that you can put inside the soup; lady’s finger, yellow zucchini, watermelon radish, baby corn, yuzu, deep fried tofu, black fungus, mushrooms, fresh shrimps, deep fried tofu.Service : 8/10The serving staffs dressed in Kimono are all very nice and polite to us. They always assist us in cooking too.After we finished eating, we were each handed a “business card” and asked to write our names on them. The card is given to customers and you are given a stamp with each dinner visit. First-timers will start from “Assistant Manager” level and will be “promoted” to the next management level on subsequent visit. So, don’t forget to bring your card every time you visit here. Plus, we will also be given a free dessert on each visit. How nice is it? Tips : Try not to come on weekends on PH as it will be a very long q.There are three outlets in Singapore:1. ＃03-81 The Atrium@Orchard, 60B, Orchard Road, Singapore 238891.Phone : +65 6336 50032. Chinatown Point (opened at 15th July 2013)Address: #02-37 Chinatown Point, 133 New Bridge Road, Singapore 059413.Phone:+65 6444 88403. Westgate (opened at 20th December 2013)Address: #03-04 WestGate, 3 Gateway Drive, Singapore 608532

Finally got round to trying this. The food - lovely stock, nice selection of veggies, the pork balls, the hint of orange peel, all good. Would have been great to have had some beef as well. However, the small table, having to manage the rather large chicken pieces without fork and knife and on small plates, the wobbly condiments stand and the stickiness of collagen makes eating there a little clumsy/uncomfortable
4
In Summary:Consistently good broth and noodles, this is the ramen to try if you are big on flavour and believe in the advertised qualities of collagen in their broth.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:A while back, this was the hype amongst some of the ladies as it was advertised to contain collagen which is good for the skin and so on. I used to avoid it as there is always a long queue of ladies with their reluctant husbands or boyfriends with them in the queue, and the only way to avoid this queue is to queue up before the restaurant opening hours (ironic). I tried it a few times at both the Dhoby Ghaut and Westgate branches and they did not fail to impress. However, that was almost a year ago.1. Service – 4 out of 5The service crew is nice and observant, refilling our water from time to time and always smiling despite the crowd.2. Ambiance – 4 out of 5The wooden décor and use of warm lighting attempts to bring out the atmosphere of a Japanese ramen bar. Ventilation is good despite the small restaurant size. One complaint will be the tight seating arrangements though which can be quite uncomfortable.3. Cleanliness – 4 out of 5Everything is good but the tables were a little sticky.4. Taste – 4 out of 5The broth is well boiled and tastes naturally fragrant. Personally, I do not buy into the idea of collagen making the skin better/more radiant but if it makes the soup tasty, why not! The ingredients are separated and placed meticulously on a serving plate which covers the bowl of broth and noodles. When ordering, you have a choice of the thick or thin noodles. My personal favourite will be the thin egg noodles. The broth comes in various forms and I usually will choose the chicken or pork ones. Also, there are side dishes, which are pretty unnecessary as a normal person will feel satisfied and full after the bowl of noodles. Being greedy, I will usually have my noodles along with the fried chicken with egg mayonnaise, a sinful combination which surprisingly, does not feel too strong in flavour.5. Value for Money – 4 out of 5Prices are similar, if not less than, as compared to the competition, despite the added claim of their collagen. For the standard and quality, you cannot go wrong with Tsukada Nojo

The Restaurant Tsukada Nojo Bijin Nabe (塚田農場 美人鍋). hails from Miyazaki, Kyushu, and is famous for its farmed JIDORI chickens. They specialize in a collagen soup beauty hotpot made by this species of chicken but it is available for dinner. We came for lunch so only tried their ramen specialty.You cannot miss this outlet, there’s queue outside.! Sorry no reservation allowed so one has to wait for a table. The store is small nut well partitioned so you still have that little privacy.. The waitress are very friendly and helpful.The noodle comes in choices of thin egg, thick mochi and rice noodle. We tried the classic tonkotsu shio broth with thin egg noodles and also Hokkaido special. Just a short wait of 5 mins + and the food arrives. We especially like the presentation in that diners can place their ingredient into the bowl of steaming ramen ourselves. And the platter includes; sliced yuzu zest, blanched green vegetables, 1/2 Ajitsuke Tamago, 2 roasted chicken fillet slices and 2 huge crispy Seaweeds are served. This allows us to add most if not all the ingredients into the ramen dish separately.The soup is absolutely delicious – strong in flavor and rich in aroma. I traveled to Japan frequently and hence find this a jem, quite authentic!! Its' soup broth is a little on the saltish side for the Hokkaido flavor but they are tasty, more importantly it contains collagen salad. The Shio taste just nice, not demanding. Noodle is still springy after a while. The portion is just right, but guys may prefer more noodle/meat. Overall, we enjoyed the dining experience at Tsukada Nojo with its unique concept and friendly staff. However price is a little on the steep side, I will visit again to pampered myself. :> And who says collagen (and beauty) is only meant for the woman.. hah

Great Chicken Broth, tasty and filling. Great feast for family and friends. I will only come for the diner because the Tasty Chicken Broth only available to be served as dinner.Outlet in Plaza Sing is small and too crowded, must wait for longer time. I visited the outlet in Chinatown Point has a shorter queue but still have to sue for an hour for sometimes. May be the outlet in West Gate will have the shortest queue

Visited on 14thDec15' w family at Plaza Singapura 3rd level around 11almost 12pm. The restaurant was half full as it is quite a small place. The young pretty lady,who served us,she is friendly n she treat my mother with care,for example, told my mother that the Ocha is hot,soup is hot n she recommend me the thin egg noodle is suitable for my mother. She recommend us to choose the Shio broth n choose the lightly salted flavour. We ordered Bijin Men w Shio (original flavour) n lightly salted $16.80 × 2=yummy. We choose the thin egg noodle out of the 3 choices-rice noodle n thick tsuru noodle. Its' soup broth is not salty n taste yummy n the most important, it contain collagen...there r 2 slices of roasted chicken fillet,Alfafa (contain many fibre - indicate in the menu),its 'crispy' eventhough it is in the soup. It's a new way of tasting as usually will eat it w salad. There r a half boiled egg,japanese spinach n 2 seaweed sheet (yummy). Chicken Nanban original$8.50. There r 4 chunky chicken pieces w egg mayo sauce n baby romaine lettuce n thousand island sauce. Strawberry Almond pudding $4.50 x 2,served in a round big bowl w pink colour water in ice cube on top is the almond pudding w strawberry cubes(a creative way to maintain coldness of e pudding n is an eye appealing. Total spend $62.50.One day will go back to try their beauty hot pot as it only served after 5pm. Have a great experience+ a nourishing lunch (collagen soup broth)+ crew is thoughtful n friendly

Visited the Plaza sing outlet for the 2nd time and queued for over an hour before being seated. Try not to go into too large groups as they are not able to join tables tgt, the group will end up being in separate tables. Collagen soup is flavorful and chicken is tender.. Ordering the set itself is sufficient $25++. Side dishes are expensive and portions are tiny.. Not so worth to order in my opinion. Overall, food quality for the hotpot set is good.
4
The restaurant is a bit small and we queued more than 1 & half hour but it was worth it as we enjoyed the delicious collagen soup, vegetables and fresh seafood. We like their idea that end of the meal, they offered free dessert to first timers. If they can offer free dessert not just for the first timers, it would be even better
4
This is for their JEM Branch.
Love their sparkling sake (you have got to try it if you haven't). Overall a good hotpot place. Fresh prawns and a lot of vegetables. Healthy eating...
4
It was our 9 years old daughter wanted to dine here again, the soup is really out of this world. Just be there early as it is a small restaurant.
4
Nice collagen hotpot, where the soup is enriching and chicken meat is tender and tasteful. Worth it but really hate the queue, waited up to 2 hours once! I usually drop by for lunch - no hotpot available for lunch but nice good ramen using the same collagen chicken soup
4
Japanese hotpot with soup made from collagen cooked with chicken meat, vegetables and seafood . A healthy meal topped with Japanese beer or sparkling wine. The serving staff are dressed in kimono to assist with the cooking. Great for family and friends outing. Beware of queue during peak hours
4
Yes collagen for the women! The portion is just right and you won't feel heavy after eating, you feel just right. Love the fact that they use good quality veggies( some are even organic ) as well as fresh seafood and chicken. They also have this special Ponzu Pepper sauce which is great to dip with - very fragrant and peppery. Service is good however, the long queue is horrendous... I have only tried Chinatown Point 2 times and both times were pretty good
3
Soup is rich, chicken tender. Thats about all the good thing i would like to say because heaps of other reviews will try to convince you of its beauty promises as the name of the hotpot suggest.They serve you the soup that comes in the form of curd. Looks like fats to me actually. It melt away when heat is applied and the tender chicken emerges from the pot of fats.Eventhough i would like to think that drinking this will make my skin appear better, but i think its nothing more than a marketing stunt. A good one and nothing wrong with marketing. To be honest, i fall for it. But upon a closer examination of what i get out of a $25 per pax pricey food, its nothing more than chicken and vegetable. My other complaint is that the portion is not significantly more when there are 4 of us.We ordered other side dishes, fried chicken with egg tartar. There were only 4 pieces in that side dish. Even though the taste was not bad, the uniqueness comes from the egg tartar sauce actually. It's pricey and fail to score big in my honest opinion because fried food rarely goes wrong anyway.Ordered side dish of fried bean curd skin and turns out that its just an additional serving of the same thing we get in our hotpot order already. Staff should have informed us.Another side dish that failed to impress even the mildest of critiques will be the chicken siew mai (Chicken dumpling) It's a very sloppy attempt to make a side dish. Its basically the same chicken ball from the hot pot soup, wrapped in a dumpling skin. There you have it. How lazy can this be and definitely not worth the extra 15 wait for them to steam it. PLUS they forgotten our order. It was not a pleasure experience for a 30 mins queue and a $100 hot pot.With a hefty price tag of $100++ and eating nothing more than Chicken and vegetable and a promise of collagen filled soup base, you can make better use of that $. Perhaps just buy a few more packet of collagen powder from Japan
4
The broth was so rich and flavourful. It was really tasty and the steamboat portion was just nice. The chicken was tender and yummy! There was a generous serving of prawns and good mix of greens. Enjoyed it. Furthermore the server was extremely friendly and thoughtful - we felt really 'at home' and comfortabl
4
The array of vegetables this steamboat has is fantastic. Fresh black fungus, yellow squash, red raddish, green sprouts, white enoki...etc.There's tasty chicken meatballs and prawns to change the flavour of the soup. My family had a discussion: At which point of adding the different ingredients did you like the soup. The first part: pure chicken is full of collagen, waiting for it to be melted down from its solid state to our beautiful intensely chicken broth.To finish off, I had the egg pudding. Burnt sugar on top and creamy milky pudding. Just a beuatiful ending to an amazing meal
5
Excellent food but you are paying for the collagen as the steamboat food is not worth S$25++ per pax. It would be the place to be if you are going for the collagen. It also has an excellent marketing strategy with promotion to the next level, so eat more and you will reach the top of the Hierarchy

Worst experience ever at Chinatown point branch last night.The manager was rude and seems like dnt care how long the customer have waited. The manager told us "first come first serve",and we have six people. We worried when it was our turn there wont be enough big table for six of us and indeed as expected after more than 1 hour waiting,the manager told us there was no big table for us and we have to sit separately. Or we have to continue to wait,what is worse the manager keep night we only left 45 mins(waiting+finish the food)That was ridiculous for us to sit separately for bday celebration. After 10 mins negotiations with the manager he chose to insit their policy and ignore customer's feedback.No matter how food is nice, I believe no customer will coma back for this kind of service
5
The soup is rich and tasty, you'll need be patient and try it at least once. The queue is crazy. Be there early.
4
...of ramen. The broth is thicker than what you would expect but it is just as delicious. I would receommend the spicy ramen and the curry ramen.
I was there at 1.45pm on a Sunday afternoon and got a table immediately.
4
My locally based colleague took me here for lunch. It was well past lunchtime and too early for dinner so the long lines mentioned in other reviews were not present. The soup was delicious and filling as was the salad. My Sapporo beer was pretty good, too
4
Tsukada Nojo is a Japanese restaurant which provides high quality chicken from Miyazaki. The broth that they produced uses the chicken only from their farms and cooked over long period of time to become a thick chicken soup base full of collagen. It is said to be a very good soup for females whom are looking to beautify with natural nutrients.The restaurants separates their timing into two different operations, noon time for ala carte, night time for steamboat. We ordered of the signaure Bijin Ramen and Miyazaki signature dishes as well. The food are really of good quality and portion are adequate. The soup base for Bijin Ramen is good enough to awe your tastebud, leaving you craving for more
2
There were 4 in front of us, and that was enough to make us queued up for more than 90 mins. Took a look at inside the restaurant, half were eating while the other half taking pictures of the food or of themselves.Annoying moment came once we stepped inside the restaurant - it's too noisy. It feels more like eating in the middle of a crowded messy morning market other than a proper restaurant. The staffs literately started shouting at you once you are in that small enclosed area. I suppose the shouting part is one of the Japanese welcoming style which they migrated from somewhere, but trust me you won't feel any welcome message from that machine-like shouting.There were total 3 staffs who served us during the meal. The 1st was a Filipino old lady, who was quite nice and patient to explain how the food were supposed to be boiled and ate.The 2nd was a Japanese young lady, who was ok when asked about if one of the dessert was left out from our order - it indeed was left out, thanks to the smart order taking guy. But her face turned dark immediately when asked to refill the soup. The worst part came when we finished up everything and proceeded to pay our bills. There was another friend of mine who was trying to ask the Japanese cashier to take her card instead of mine. Under such circumstances, good cashier will smile and smartly take one of the card with reasons like "higher rebate" or "guys should pay"; average cashier will just randomly take any of the card; and this cashier, she stared at us, looked angry, and shouted "can you settle for yourselves? which card are you using?". By saying that, she even left the counter and left us standing there being so confused about her attitude. All-in-all, not a enjoyable meal at all at this Plaza Singapura branch, mainly due to the environment and the service. If you don't mind these then by all means go for it, otherwise, I'll recommend any of the local Japanese steamboat stores - they all have better service and environment, plus you don't have to Q for 1.5 hours

I have been a fan of Tsukado Nojo since my early visits to Japan... (they have over a 100 branches and counting)...I really enjoyed their chicken noodle and by far its the best Japanese Chicken restaurant i have eaten in till date. they also serve with the greatest passion and enthusiasm that i have seen in Japanese restaurant. Singapore unfortunately (or should say fortunately as they at least serve this much) serves a limited menu. but their chicken noodle soup (Bijin Nabe) is to die for.. the organically home grown chicken, their perfectly boiled egg (among other additives in the soup), and the friend chicken nuggets (topped with mayo) are something i would recommend you to go for... their overall chicken broth is delightfully full of flavour and is nice and healthy too (as its full of collagen) its a rarity that a brand like this comes along so pure and true to its belief! i would recommend you to give it a try! slightly more expensive as compared to other chicken noodle soups but totally worth the price
4
After queuing for about half an hour, we were ushered in finally, to a table. The interior was infused with a modernistic authentic Japanese flavor. The service was really attentive and amicable, right from the startLooking at the menu, I was gratified to note that it was not a buffet concept. I let *Celine do the ordering. She ordered the Bijin Nabe - Beauty Hotpot Set for 2 to share (SGD$25.00) which would include a hot pot of collagen soup, ingredients and dessert.Then they placed the huge chunk of collagen (fats?) into the pot and set to boil. I was fascinated to see the jelly-like collagen pudding slowly dissolving into soup, and the Jidori chicken parts were beginning to be discernible. One of the staff served the soup to us in a Sake cup. I took a sip and was amazed by the lusciousness of Jidori chicken collagen soup.Then the friendly waitress helped to place the rest of the ingredients into the sizzling hot pot of boiling collagen - some chicken meatball pasta, vegetables, prawns, fried tofu and golden mushrooms etc. The magenta slices were actually Watermelon Radish! The vegetables were fresh and the prawns were succulent.We also added on a Chicken Nanban (SGD$8.50) - a traditional Miyazaki way of marinated deep fried chicken. It was very delicious - the outside was crispy and crunched of a "deep fried beancurd skin" texture, embracing tender meat within. The spicy sauce on the side was simply irresistable as well, lending credence to the already-tasty chicken.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/dinner-at-tsukada-nojo-at-chinatown.htm

Had always wanted to try this beauty hot pot ( Bijin Nibe) but was deterred by their long queues. Today is my lucky day, was there pretty early before 6pm, hence no queue. After seated for 10 Mins, crowd started coming in. Minimum 2 pax & cost $25++ per pax. You can order side dishes if you need more food to go with yur hot pot.counter staff was friendly & polite & will inform you when you will be seated. Once seated, the collagen hotpot will be served, serving staff would explain how to start yur dinner. Once the collagen jelly melts, staff will scoop some soup into tasting cups for you to taste the soup base & eating the chicken parts with their sauces before adding other ingredients like veg, beancurds, squash, corn etc. soup was tasty but salty but it was tasty after adding the ingredients. Really enjoy having many bowls of the soup. We also ordered their egg noodles to go with our soup, was really good. After our satisfying dinner, was surprised to hve a complimentary dessert nicely drawn on the plates. Diners also get a stamp for your next visit for complimentary appetizer
5
Healthy Ramen? Can I have 10 bowls please!I absolutely love how authentic the food here is. Their ramen differentiates itself from the common pork broth you get elsewhere. The Chicken Collagen broth is both thick and flavorful. As a meat lover, I would also recommend adding a portion of chicken for $2.80. It is well marinated and adds a punch to the dish
4
Don't know if they take reservations or not..the line was long but food was worth the wait really. I think the meal was quite healthy (?) with thick collagen based bouillon and vegetables. meat and rest. Quite noisy . Very popular . Very good value . Will definitely go back
5
One of the best hotpot I've eaten.
The soup is just heavenly.
Service is good, food is awesome!
Danny, the manager on duty made our visit a pleasant experience!
4
Very unique soup base! Love the fresh organic veges and collagen soup... do go early as the place fills up very quick and they might sold out as fast as around 8pm !
3
This was our second visit and we made sure we were there early because we didn't want to stand around waiting. There was a already a short queue but thankfully it was due to the inattentive staff who didn't peek outside.Once seated, a waiter took our order, came back to to re-confirm some items, seems he only remembered 5 out of the 9 items we ordered.The food was pretty good, the stock was rich and tasty with a good umami that left a satisfying feel on the mouth.I'm not a fan of the ambience for sure. It was loud, with Japanese music blaring in the background, which probably explained why the table next to us were speaking loudly over the din. It was pure assault on the ears! We ate and left, which may be the whole intention of the restaurant not wanting guests to linger for desserts or drink
4
We picked the beauty pot, of course. We must know what the fuss was all about.We were hungry but fortunately, the pudding melted faster than expected into bubbling broth. The broth looks rich and I can imagine it giving gout sufferes a helluva pain. The ingredients did not look like much to me, but the meal was surprisingly filling.I am not fussy about noodles so I have no comment on that, but I had fun with the condiments. Lotsa fun. Fell in love with the yuzu pepper and just kept adding and dipping, adding and dipping. Probably took more than I should. Was tempted to steal the bottle. Anyone knows where I can buy it? Was also interesting to look at their veggies. Some look so darn pretty I cannot believe such heavenly stuff do exist. Be careful not to overcook the 4 big prawns (for 2 pax) - we played safe and ended up with leathery prawns ;<Be warned that they do not have a lot of main courses to choose from. The Prawn Fried Rice came with 4 big prawns, I think, and costs S$12 or so. cannot remember what else they have.Staff was ever willling to help, although sometimes it can be a bit hard to catch their attention as they fly all over the little eatery attending to diners. The place is a bit claustrophobic for me, but then I suppose tininess is a Japanese feature...They offered us complimentary dessert that could be milk pudding or cheese tofu, we could not be sure. But anyway, it was nothing to shout about. What was shout-worthy was the presentation. The three tiny toothpicked cubes were presented on a huge squarish plate sporting a drawing of my friend and me! Just a few strokes of choc sauce or something, and our faces appeared on the plate, centre parting and all. Maybe that's how they draw all diners, but it did look like it was drawn just for us. Funny that a tiny serving of compimentary sweets should make my day and leave me feeling downright special. This is the beauty of Japanese hospitality built on sharp observation skills and thoughtfulness.Since the complimentary dessert was so dainty in portion, we had to order more sweets. Pardon my goldfishy memory, but I think I ordered the pear sorbet. It came in a glass soaked in a bowl of cold water. This is typical of Japanese meticulousness, but I though it was superfluous... Maybe not everyone wolfs down dessert the way I do and keeping the temperature low is neccessary for their diing pleasure...The killer was the wait. I had to stand in queue for an hour, even though I was told by my friend and had also read that I could just leave my number and go shopping and wait for their phone call when seats became available. Watched their introductory video at the entrance many, many times, bleah... The cost was also on the high side for a cheapskate like me.But it was a good experience and I would not mind taking friends there for the novelty. However, I hope someone else can do the queueing next time ;D And I hope the next choc sauce portrait will gimme a slimmer face..

Come here for dinner and my ordering the famous bijin nabe..Serving was quite fast..This signature dish have a very thick and fresh chicken broth.. The waiter scoop 2 small cup of fresh broth for me and my son to have the original taste..My son very like the noodle mixed with minced chicken ball..I personally very like the chilly sauce with fried garlic.. very nice..I order caramel egg pudding for dessert.. My son and I like it very very much..Other than that the staff also prepare jelly on a stick with cute message with chocs and strawberry painting on a plate.. Got a little bit disappointment only when I pay to the cashier and ask for plastic bag.. The cashier ask me to further wait after she cashier another person behind me just can give plastic bag..Other than this 90% satisfy with the service and food.

One of my Japanese friend took us there, she said food is very good and popular. We have chicken noodles soup it was as good food in Tokyo. All of my friends enjoyed. If you go for lunch I recommend you to go early, otherwise you might have to wait on the que for 15 to 20 mins. Very quick service

This restaurant has another outlet in Chinatown point, #02-37, 133 New Bridge Road.It is not very hard to find for those who drives and park at Chinatown Point. It is right where the escalator brings to. For SGD 25 (subject to gst and service charge), it have high concentrated chicken broth and the waitress are very friendly to make one feels they are in japan itself instead of back home.It is always swarming and booking and reservation is prohibited as every single seats have to be made use of. If you think of going in first and wait for those who comes later, no way. You gotta wait till all parties arrives before they will look for a place for you. It have appetizers and the waitress will put in the ingredient for you after the chicken broth are fully dissolves. Once the chicken broth has dissolved completely, tast a small cup for it is full of chicken taste in the most concentrates. After the tasting, the waitress will come over and put in the ingredient for you. And when it is cooked, taste the broth again. the taste changes.At then end of the meal, there will be a dessert. Every dessert design differs from table to table. And they are very cute.As the saying goes, Bijin is a japanese for beauty. Once you had it, it will turn one into beauty. and it also means beautiful soup.There are other side dishes to choose from for a top up price. The thin egg noodle out of the 3 variety of noodles is the nicest among them.We choose this for 2014 Mother's day eating and all mothers are happy with it

Good place for a quick casual business lunch. This small establishment seems to be quite popular among people working in the Area. If you walk around the mall, while others are still trying to fill the table, this one is full. Quality and taste are very good. Try to get a seating on the right. If they place you in the back on the left, you will look into the kitchen, which, ehr, is not really conducive to a wonderful dining experience

Although my preference is still with a good tonkutsu (pork-based) soup and charsiew for a ramen, Tsukada Nojo's Bijin Men, with its rich chicken collagen based soup base ('salty', but 'less salty') is okay as a once-in-awhile for me.. If I could change anything, it would be that their egg be a little more cooked (maybe by another minute) because I found the white a little too soft and the yolk too liquid, and that the two slices of chicken meat wasn't so 'supermarket deli tasting'... otherwise, still a very good bowl of ramen..

It's definitely not easy to get a place at this wonderful cozy eatery on weekends. Be prepared to go about 5pm to reserve your place, as it fills up very quickly and waiting time can go up to 3 hours but they do not allow phone reservation, only first come first serve basis. They have limited choices on their menu for dinner and the main item is this collagen rich hot pot (as described in other reviews). It's worth the wait as the price is affordable - $25++/pax for hot pot. And with very good service! Tea and drinks are free and the waiter will guide you thru the right way to eat the hot pot. What gets the extra star is that the staff took the effort to end the dinner off with a sweet note from them to say - arigato, thank you for your support! They deserve thumbs up for good service and awesome food! (:
