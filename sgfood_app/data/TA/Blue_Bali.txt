Tragically, closed now. Had a beautiful ambiance and very good food. I'm hoping it will reopen at another location. It was hard to get to there near the botanical gardens

Four of us went here for dinner. The atmosphere / décor is pretty cool. We tried an assortment of dishes. Most of it was decent but the winner by far was the pumpkin prawn. Absolutely loved that.
5
Very charming Balenese style restaurant. Very pretty at night. Romantic atmosphere. Good food and friendly staff
5
One of the most outstanding restaurants in Singapore. Back to Botanic Garden an Indonesian Restaurant, with great food, excellent service and a the capability of brewing German Beer in the own microbrewery. Nice hideaway after a stressful day. The seating tables in the garden are relaxing and comforting

We were expecting Balinese cuisine but it turned out that we were served with yellow curry (Thai?) , Gado Gado ( Malaysian/Singaporean?) , chengdol (Penang ?) and Gula Malacca desert ( Melaka?). Maybe the beef rendang, which by the way was yummy is Balinese ( but Bali being a Hindu region should not be serving beef). So we left the place in a confuse state. The open air concept is not suitable for our hot and humid climate and it did not help with the many fans placed along the peripheral of the dining hall. I read about the not so nice comments regarding the service. I informed the waiter that we have a reservation but this was not in the ipad that the waiter was carrying. It certainly needed improvements. By the way, the building would be returning to NParks soon
4
This was my second visit, as I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. It really gives you the Balinese feeling. Try to get a nice table where you can sit on the ground. The waiters were friendly, but the service could be improved. Is takes some time to get contact if you want to order. I also received my main course 10 minutes later than my husband.The food was good, although I recommend to orders shared platter instead of a normal main course.
4
I've never seen a restaurant with a decor quite like Blue Bali - it is stunning. The food is also relatively well priced and of good quality. It is very authentically Malaysian. It is a short walk from the Botanic gardens and I would recommend this being the best restaurant to visit in the surrounding area. I'd recommend sitting away from the water features as they typically attract insects. The toilets could have also been cleaner. Service was okay - you need to consistently press them for menus, orders etc but the vibe is a very relaxed one.
5
We arrived at night which prevented a view of the exterior of the Blue Bali Restaurant, but we were blown away on entering the building. We were graciously escorted to a table in a typical Balinese style surrounded by greenery and fountains, and the sounds of some very happy frogs.Both starters and mains were shared amongst our party of three as we all wanted to have a taste of everything.Starters:Mango Salsa PrawnAvocado PrawnSpiced Chicken with PomeloMains:Indonesian Beef RedangButter ChickenPumpkin PrawnThe verdict on each item was "awesome", and I can highly recommend Blue Bali for a most enjoyable meal
5
they even brew their own beer here. Anyway, the prawns in the sauce as an appetiser were to die for. we then had some indonesian and indian dishes to share and I must say they were all excellent. even the desserts (sticky rice and the likes) were great. absolutely loved the place and will be back
4
The ambiance starts outside this restaurant and continues through the foyer. The tables are nice but we ended up in one of the little areas made for couples. Lay down and enjoy your beer and dinner. The food was fabulous and the variety of beers was good. I particularly enjoyed the dragon fruit beer. The meal was prompt and served in an orderly fashion. I like when a restaurant places an even number of items on a dish that is meant to be shared between two people. Thank you for this consideration. The price of the dishes were very reasonable. Again the food was fabulous and the service matched the food
4
We visited this restaurant with four children and four adults. The casual style seating was perfect for them and made the whole evening really relaxed and super fun. The food was amazing too! Love the decor.

A very interesting spot in the midst of Singapore's gorgeous Botanical Gardens, Blue Bali combines their best spin on Balinese dining with a self-proclaimed 'nano-brewery'. Certainly not ALL of the beers work (for everyone), but they do make a unique mix of brews. The food is decent and you can find some truly Balinese dishes (e.g. 'gado-gado')Definitely worth a visit if you're strolling the gardens - which you should! - and needing a snack and/or sip
2
Our first time at BB, great setting and looked really inviting. But the service was atrocious - 3x we asked for drinks each time the waiter walked away. The local brew beer looked good on the menu, but the flat, just over half filled glass of homebrew couldn't be finished. When it eventually came the food was pleasant but the starters and mains were delivered at once. So we won't be going back
5
Good quality food, mix of Indonesia, Indian, and other Asian specialties. A bit more on the expensive side but still good value for money. Happy hour in the early evening, nice and strong cocktails and other drinks. Burning quite a lot of incense sticks to keep the mosquitos away. We ordered a great mix of different dishes and shared, all was very good
3
This place is very beautiful and the food is delicious, definitely a place I would take someone. But last time I was there, my food arrived 45 minutes late, so late in fact, that my friends had finished their main course before mine had even arrived. I told the staff and they gave me a lousy 5% discount on my meal which totalled to a deduction of $1.20. Not okay
4
This unique brewery has everything for a perfect date - amazing location, surrounded by greenery, chilled brewed beer, asian food, and good vibes. The food is good, they have vegetarian options, portions are big. Do try their beer, they even have pairings with the food

One of my first dates with the love of my life was to Blue Bali and therefore it has a special place in my heart. The atmosphere is gorgeous and very romantic. Unfortunately, on our last visit we were met with the most unbelievably rude and unprofessional staff. No exaggeration: our table was not checked on a single time throughout the evening. It took us sometimes more than 5 minutes to get a server to pay attention to us waving them over to our table- this continued even after I let the staff know that we had been waiting continuously throughout the evening for service. At the end of the night, after a long and frustrating wait to both pay the bill and get the card returned I asked for the manager. The staff told me the manager was out but would be back in about ten minutes. I told them I would wait. Finally, they sent a bus boy to talk to me as 'the manager' and when I asked for the name of the 'the manager' he gave me a random name which did not match the business cards for the manager placed on the bar counter. I am especially disappointed because the restaurant is sentimental and nostalgic to me, I really wanted to write it off as simply a one off bad night, but being flat out dishonest and refusing to let me speak with the manager was more than I can tolerate from a business. :( sad

If you're looking for a 'chill-out' place with cosy nooks, 'bed' seats for 2 & a beautiful ourdoor ambience, then Blue Bali is the place. It's a hidden gem on the other side of the Botanical gardens, & it's a rare find in Singapore. It has many different types of seating & an alfresco section - just great for a bite & drinks & especially to 'chill out' with friends. It's off the beaten track, but you can find it with GPS & I think there may be a shuttle from a nearby MRT
5
Beautiful location just on the edge of the Botanic Gardens. A lovely layout for the restaurant, you feel like you are somewhere really exotic. Their own brewed beers are really good (or so my husband tells me). My husband loves their beef rending, and I love their mongolian chicken. We take and of our friends/family who are visiting Singapore to this restaurant, and they all love it too
3
A nice atmosphere as if you were in Bali. But the service is not very efficient and really slow. And the food didn't meet my expectations....maybe I did the wrong choice. It remains a place to try for a dinner especially
5
Excellent food, and charming and authentic surroundings. Not easy to get there without a car/taxi. A bit expensive. Good service.
4
We love to come here with friends and family who are visiting Singapore and don't have the time to go to Bali. They can feel as if they were in Bali. The old black and white colonial house is charming and is facing the Botanic Gardens. The restaurant can accommodate a large group .The children love the Satay there. Great atmosphere
4
Quite an amazing atmosphere to dine in those suroudings. Bushes, jungle, waterfalls, frogs it's allmost surreal, at least at night. Food is very good, wine list is rather small but sufficient. The only drawback is the service which is really slow. A part from this you will dine in a great nature environment and you could indeed feel yourself in Bali.Definitely worth a try if you haven't been.
4
The location in the Botanic Gardens is excellent, giving you the opportunity to reach it on foot in a beautiful environment. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very cosy an the service is good. The platter are of good quality and an interesting option for 3-4 people group

Starters, my wife and I both had the Avocado Prawns which were delicious with a lovely Bali island dressing. For mains, we both had the Sumatra Beef Rendang. We were a bit disappointed as the beef loin braised was not soft, but quite tough to eat. We have eaten this type of dish before in Bintan and if it is not overcooked it is a delight to eat. Unfortunately, they got it wrong tis time. For desserts, I had the Sticky Rice with Mango and Coconut Ice Cream and my wife had the Deep fried Banana Spring Roll with Vanilla Ice Cream. The sticky rice was really good but the mango was just that, mango that had been sliced and placed on top of the rice. Overall, the ambiance of the place was such a delight. Would we go back again, almost certainly. Next time we will try some of the other mouth watering dishes

Came here to celebrate a special day with my fiancÃ©e. I booked the Lesehan, advertised as "Romantic Balinese Lesehan where you have total privacy in the Balinese garden, sitting on cushions and enjoying your company in paradise".It was absolutely pouring with rain when we arrived. And the girl who received us told us, not very clearly, that the Lesehan's were wet and cannot be used. We were seated at a regular table. Upon further inquiry the manager came and told me there was a Lesehan we could use, but the pillows might be a bit wet on the side. We opted to move to the Lesehan. I let the restaurant know in advance that it was a special day for us, so I was quite disappointed with the service from the front desk. The Lesehan's are nice, but are definitely not in "total privacy" as promised. They are just next to the regular tables. Also, because we sat cross-legged and the table didn't allow us to tuck our knees under it, we sat quite far apart.The food was good. We ordered the Indonesian Rijsttafel Platter, which was plenty for the two of us and delicious. And once we got over the annoyance of the arrival, we had a great meal.If we were received in a better manner, I would definitely visit again, now I am not so sure
4
Charming Indonesian with atmosphere just behind the aromatic garden at the Botanic Gardens. You can sit on sofas or on cushions on the floor under a traditional carved wooden roof with open sides.Lots of fans so not too hot.Solicitous service with large menu and interesting selection of beers.Food arrived very quickly which was good because we had a very hungry 7 yr old with us.The Beef Rendang was fantastic, duck was good, unfortunately the chicken satay was very dry, but overall the meal was very good.Resonable price.A very relaxing enjoyable lunch, a delightful break after a long walk through the Botanical Gardens

After a long lull from writing reviews, I will start my effort to review with this visit to Blue Bali. 3 (2 locals and a french) of us were on time and we were pleased with the free parking (rare in Singapore) in front of the restaurant and a Bali like restaurant setting. though there is no air condition and It was pleasant. Because it is far from the maddening crowded in Orchard or Marina, it would be a good place to have dinner and hang out with friends there. We ordered quite a lot of food and all I remembered was that the beef rendang and fish were the best because we finished it while the platter was a disappointment. After all, it is quite close to Balinese cuisine and for that, I would give it a thumbs up as it is not easy to have diverse choices in Singapore these days. As I am not into mocktails or cocktails or alcohol, I cannot comment much on this topic.While the staff made attempt to serve, it was quite obvious that they were inexperienced as they committed quite a number of errors in the ordering as well as the serving process.Despite some inadequacies, I would still recommend this restaurant as it offers a nice alternative to the typical restaurants in Singapore. But if you are there purely for the food, then I would suggest to consider only the beef rendang and the fish and don't order the platter of Balinese cuisine
5
Blue Bali is our go-to restaurant for group events at my organization. When we want to impress international visitors we always take them to Blue Bali. The food is diverse (halal, vegetarian, fish, meat), the ambience is amazing, the service is friendly. It genuinely feels like Bali--the incense, the music, the art, the batik decor--an oasis of greenery not far from downtown Singapore and right next to the Botanic Garden. Our one disappointment is that we felt like corners were cut at our last event. We had a group of about 30 and ordered food and an open bar for that many people. The buffet servings were so small that people mentioned being hungry afterward (several people went back for seconds only to find that the food was all gone) and the open bar only had wine and beer on display (even though we had paid for the full open bar including liquor). We were particularly disappointed since the open bar at our previous event at Blue Bali had really been a hit--our visitors still mention what a fun time they had. Visitors are always impressed by Blue Bali. But as repeat customers we were disappointed that the restaurant seemed to skimp on food and alcohol at our last event. We were surprised and a bit hurt, actually. But apart from that we love Blue Bali and will probably take another group there in the future

Saturday night dinner for 2. The restaurant was hosting quite a sizable Christmas function in the bar so the staff members were stretched to deal with a full restaurant as well. But the wait staff, to a person, were so charming that we really didn't mind the wait. My prawns with spicy mango salsa probably had sat aside for a while, so were just warm when presented. The salsa had no noticeable mango and was onion flavored more than spicy. Quite a flop of a dish. The pumpkin prawn curry was delicious and beautifully cooked, but frankly very sweet so if you don't have a sweet tooth then I'd recommend something else.The whole snapper was a lovely fresh fish, but overcooked on one side almost to the point of being inedible. I think this (and the cooling prawns above) is evidence of a stressed, or under-staffed, kitchen. So honestly I think that when we next return I would find better chef work in evidence.Mango and sticky rice plus banana spring rolls were our desert choices and both were satisfying and pleasing. Can recommend The NZ Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir, by the glass, are perfectly fine accompaniments. Prices are reasonable. In summary, go for the locale and surroundings, plus the great service. Don't be too demanding re food though, and you'll not be disappointed.

Lovely little place on the edge of the botanic gardens. Two of us had tapas including satay, tofu and samosas. Very peaceful traditional atmosphere. Highly recommended.
1
We were served the pomelo salad and the avocado prawns for straters, dug confit and snapper for mains. The food was not tasty at all, worse, it was tasteless. The pomelo salad looked more like dry flat noodles and the avocado prawns were drowning in a sea of red mayonnaise. The duck confit was dry and the snapper didn't seem fresh. Never again!Thank god it's shutting down soon
2
We came here for a farewell of a friend- it's a lot very setting in the botanical gardens in an old villa gardens. Standard Indonesian fare, but of the 10 people at the table 3 were served lukewarm or cold food. We had to ask for a drink refill 5 times over the course of 30 minutes before we got anything. Service was indifferent. Food was nicely presented but nothing more special than any where else. A bit of a pity, as it's a place that would be nice to take guests but they've pretty much blown it
4
this place is in the middle of Bukit TImah but one who never have guessed because there is so much space and nice pagoda. The food is a little bit of western and a little bit of Indian and some Indonesian food. There are also some cocktails to relax for Friday evening. All in all, come here for the atmosphere and a place to chill
5
Nice surroundings, good food, very traditional.. ideal for couple's romantic dinner. Candle light, fresh air, mystic music... whats more we gonna wish for..We had butter chicken there with a plate of samosa and chutni(sauce).. really delicious. The waiters were so nicely dressed in traditional balinese dress, and were so humble.A very good experience indeed. Will surely come back for a dinner whenever we visit singapore
5
I came here on a date, it was the perfect environment for a romantic meal. We sat on cushions on the ground (beware ladies wearing dresses) and the decorations made us feel like we had actually been transported to Bali. The food came in big portions and was very tasty and well presented. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, seems like it is still a hidden gem.
3
We were a large party of around 20 people and were seated outside on the decking. We selected from the menu a starter & a main course but unfortunately there was no coordination of how the food came out from the kitchen, some of us received our starters, the ones missing didn't arrive till 10 minutes later while another in our party received her whole meal together. Not acceptable really.The food was tasty when it did arrive it was just a shame that we couldn't all eat together.It's also worth mentioning that if you are seated on the decking outside, ensure you apply lots of mosquito repellant, unfortunately I didn't and lived to pay the price!!
5
Tucked away from the road, you feel as if you are entering a magical place. Water features, wind chimes, beautiful foliage - it is as if you really enter Bali. Food was excellent, hand crafted beer delicious, and the atmosphere was just excellent. Would highly recommend for romantic dinner, a bit casual for business colleagues. Take your shoes off, climb into the padded benches, curl up and enjoy

It was love at the first sight when I found this place. I was looking for a venue to celebrate my 1st wedding anniversary that resemble a place that me and Husband tie a knot a year ago in Bali.The resto is bit hidden, it is at the back of NUS university Bukit Timah Campus. From outside it does look like a colonial building but it changed all the atmosphere when you step inside. I really love the setting, combination of big Joglo house and few lesehan huts surrounded by greeneries. Another things that make it this place more look alike Bali are those typical Balinese statues fountain, little river under the lesehan huts and the nature sounds really brought you fly to the island of God feel's like. As we're arrived in the night, we smell that burn insence that bring more pleasant soft woody smell and I believe also to get rid of those insect or mosquitos. This place located inside the Botanic Garden, so expect to see or to hear those creatures welcome you there which it is very natural, not a big problem. We chose our seating at lesehan (no chair and you will sit on the floor, don't worry they provide some cushion) which more cute, designed for 2 or maximum 4 people. To get this lesehan you have to spend minimum $100 in you bill. We tried (of course) Indonesian Rijsttafel as our main course with Avocado Prawn for starter, ended with Es Sago Gula Malaka for dessert. For the food wise, the taste just nearly as original Indonesian food. I can say the portion for the Rijsttafel is enough for 2-3 people sharing. My Husband tried their house brewery beer as well Doshi and Bali Gold (taste better compare to Doshi, lighter in color n taste). The waitresses have excellent service, polite and response quickly to your queries. Well, it was just a perfect place for us to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary, and for sure we will come there again and again....and again.

Located at the edge of the botanic gardens, this place offers a truly mesmerizing atmosphere and unforgettable food. The traditional furnishing, the music, the scents, the sounds of the animals living in the garden - it gives this place a magical touch.I've been to Bali one year ago and craved for the fine beef, peppered with exotic spices which is served there - and I found it again. The Blue Bali offers truly authentic balinese dishes with a special touch of modern kitchen.The service was also truly friendly. I will visit again
5
Had a great sumptuous meal here.
Their beersite are great.
Must visit while in Singapore for a heavenly culinary experience.
5
This place is very exotic and food is very nice. There are vegetarian options so no woory if u come with vegetarian friends.
5
We went with friends while visiting Singapour, entering this restaurant you feel like entering a new world. Very good service, good food & the atmosphere is perfect.
5
I have forgotten how many times we've eaten here and every time it is a hit. We almost always have the platters and then share everything. The setting is perfect in a lush garden but so far we've never really had problems with mosquitos there. Probably the best Indonesian restaurant in Singapore that we know. They also have some good sauvignon blanc wine
5
IÂ´ve been several times and always was a perfect expierence. Nice place, relaxed and carefully decorated, nice food, perfectly cooked, nice staff, always friendly and helpul

We came across the Blue Bali Restaurant on our travels through the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It was a welcome surprise and a break from the heat. The food was lovely and the service good. The staff direct fans to blow over you while you eat. Very thoughtful. We enjoyed it very much
4
This restaurant is ideal if you are looking to have birthday meal in restaurant which takes you away from Singapore. Blue Bali transports you into Bali sitting in Singapore. It is an experience restaurants, set up ideally to give you a special dining experience. The food is fantastic and caters to all tastes and cuisines. They have an extensive list wines and cocktails to pair up with your meal. Try sitting in the pagoda style seats - Indonesian mats and comfort cushions
5
Ate at this restaurant twice while visiting our daughter and son-in-law. Such a lovely experience. The service was friendly but professional and the food was excellent. There was a varied and interesting menu and the butter chicken was to die for. The jug of cocktail was good too! Will definitely be back when we visit again next year

Step into a different world at Blue Bali - a spacious restaurant tucked away from the madding crowd near the Botanic Gardens, with decor that is decidedly Balinese and candle-lit tables beckoning at every turn. Yes, it was almost as if we were having a romantic dinner in Bali, Indonesia.It was thankfully not a very humid evening and the ambience was really nice. We were surrounded by lush greenery in the non-air conditioned dining area...without a single mosquito in sight. We also found the staff friendly, attentive and prompt. However, the menu was a little strange - a quick glance showed that it didn't just offer Indonesian fare but Mongolian, Indian, Peranakan and Western dishes like sirloin steak and duck confit. We were also surprised that the popular roast pig that is ubiquitous in Bali wasn't on the menu. Yet judging from the different cuisines offered, the menu was a clear attempt to suit almost every palate.We ordered three plates of nasi goreng and their "signature" roast chicken. I found it amusing that when we ordered the nasi goreng in varying degrees of spiciness (one non-spicy, one moderate and another really, really spicy), they really took us at our word and one of the servings delivered was actually ultra spicy with generous bits of chilli padi (incredibly hot tiny chillies!) mixed into the rice! It was delicious but my tongue was on fire!We also ordered a fried toufu dish but then someone suddenly ordered the duck confit because apparently it's mentioned in some food reviews. Given that we were sharing, it was an odd combination in view of the other dishes we had ordered, but what the heck. The duck dish came later and was surprisingly not too bad, although nothing like some of the superb dishes of duck confit I have had in France and the UK (and I must say I feel uncomfortable comparing duck confit at a Balinese-themed restaurant with those served in French restaurants in any part of the world). We all also found it rather odd that the tiny portion of potato salad that came with the duck had coconut in it. Hmmmm. Well, it's probably some fusion idea, what with such an eclectic menu and all. But it was really, really rather odd.We didn't find the desserts too exciting and so adjourned elsewhere for that.I would say the Blue Bali is a refreshing change for a fun night out with friends
5
Went to Blue Bali straight from Changi. I had never been, but knowing the area I knew where it was. The taxi driver was confused, as it is a bit confusing to get there, but "ok Lah" when he saw it after our directions and he smiled !Warm greetings, lovely ambience surrounded by Botanical Gardens and a nice selection of dishes. Enjoyed good service, beautiful food and a relaxing evening. Prices are similar to Melbourne for similar food and service. A very nice place to eat and relax
4
Nice and totally different ambiance.require reservations family members will love the food choices costly but worth going with on a special evening.try home made beer.
5
This is one of the restaurants we go to when we're not sure where else to go. Having lived in Singapore for 2 years we know how expensive eating out is. Blue Bali is a fabulous setting and we've taken many guests there who are all impressed by the decor and ambience. You can sit at ordinary tables or low level in traditional indonesian style.The food is plentiful and we love the starters. The Nasi Goring is pretty good and the butter chicken. Relaxing atmosphere and always a warm welcome. Can get a bit buggy as it is in the botanic gardens so if you're prone to getting bitten take spray - but they always have plenty of mosi coils on the go
5
I've problem been to Blue Bali 20 times and have always had a wonderful experience. This restaurant, though a little hard to find located on NUS campus, is worth the effort. As soon as you step through the doors, you are transported into a quiet tranquil setting at the edge of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. The food it consistently good and the staff is friendly and helpful. We have taken numerous visitors to Blue Bali and it is ALWAYS there favorite place we've visited
5
The quality of the food, the home-brewed beer and the service is simply outstanding. Like with the neighboring Botanic Gardens visiting the Blue Bali takes you on a journey to peace, relaxation and well-being. I have been to Blue Bali many times (since 2015), always happy, the best in Singapore, fair prices and that is why they have won me as a regular guest
5
We had an excellent dining experience celebrating my mom birthday. Location are not easy to find as expected due to the fact that this place is suppose to be a hidden gem. You really felt that you are transported to Bali. Our food order consist of rendang, duck, sate and vegetable. I would say I really enjoy all the dishes. Never fail to deliver. During the birthday celebration, my mom was surprised by the team strumming the guitar singing the birthday song for her. We have an amazing dining time there. Thank you to all the team. Keep up the good work.
5
Outdoor dining in great surroundings next to the Botanic Gardens. Staff were attentive and helpful. Good choice of food on offer, all excellently prepared and served
5
Wow. What a zenned out place. Felt like I was right back in Bali. Absolutely gorgeous tapestries and outdoor dining. Tucked away in the botanic gardens within a water garden. Food was incredible. Service was lovely. Prices were fair. The traditional seating is beautiful but can get a bit hot, so if this makes you uncomfortable would recommend sitting at normal 'western' tables under the fans. Will absolutely be returning here! Thank you for a lovely Sunday brunch
4
"Hut" idea was great, imparting a natural feel to the place. Attentive staff and food was served pretty quick. Indonesian platter was yummy. Drinks were good too. Coconut icecream was so-so. The starters were served last, only after a reminder. No complaints otherwise. A must go place
5
What a charming place. From the minute I walked in the door, I actually felt like I was in Bali. The atmosphere was wonderful with beautiful Balinese furniture and Balinese music surrounded by beautiful greenery. All dining is al fresco and some of the seating is without chairs, just cushions on the floor. They do a great job of placing fans and air cooling devices strategically around the place so you don't feel hot at all. There is a slight smell of citronella but isn't overpowering and normally I attract mosquitos but not tonight. The food was really tasty and reasonably priced. Although there are many traditional Balinese dishes, there is also Thai, Malay and Indian mixed in. The service was very good especially since there was a large party going on whilst we were there. I actually think it would be a great place for a party. It also has a pretty comprehensive wine list and the wine cost is reasonable for Singapore. I really enjoyed my evening and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be transported to Bali for an evening
5
I've been to Blue Bali 4 times now since moving to Singapore a year ago. It's not far from the city centre but you feel like you are in a secluded tropical garden. The food is always amazing. My favourite dishes are the pumpkin prawns and the beef rendang. I also enjoyed the selection of desserts this time, which I hadn't previously tried. The service is excellent and the staff are all very friendly. I recently organised a company dinner for 25 people at Blue Bali. The whole thing was fantastic from beginning to end. I selected the menu - with Robin, the owner, who couldn't do enough to help. The food as usual was delicious and there was lots of it. The staff were attentive and friendly and really looked after us. Not a problem at all for the restaurant to keep up its very high standards for a group of 25 either. I can't wait to go back
5
The setting is nice, the staff are efficient and helpful, the food was delicious, the bill was very reasonable. What more can I say? We will be back!
5
Accidental discovery to this lovely place. Staffs were all courteous, delicious food enough for 2 and reasonable price with the Bali ambiance worth to endorse to family and friends :-)

Blue Bali has a lovely ambience, authentic Balinese deco which makes you feel you are dining at a quiet restaurant away from Singapore. The air is thick with the smoke from mosquito repellent incense. We didn't get bitten by any mosquitoes. They have fans all around to relieve you from the heat and humid weather. The service is EXCELLENT. The staff are very obliging and did their best. The food is delicious. $9 for a plate of tofu, $12 for a plate of kailan. $15 for a plate of brocolli. The mains cost around $22 for a plate of 7 pieces of prawns in pumpkin gravy. If you don't mind the price and lack of air-conditioning, you will enjoy the warm ambience at this quiet oasis pampered by the friendly staff
5
A dinner at Blue Bali is like being in Bali without having to get on a plane. The atmosphere of the restaurant (outdoors, green, spacious, Balinese furniture and decor, Balinese music and Balinese hospitality) is wonderful. (It is al fresco dining, though, so maybe not the place to be for aircon lovers) They really do get it right.The food is wonderful, very tasty. The only thing which is a bit odd is that next to Indonesian cuisine, you also find Thai, Malay and other dishes on the menu - less authentic and reminds you that you are not at Bali after all. Prices are reasonable for Singapore. During our dinner we did not experience any mosquitoes
5
We spent a superb evening in the Blue Bali in early May.The location is a bit difficult to find, our first taxi driver dropped us at the wrong entrance of the Botanical Garden. Once you are there you find an Indonesian style restaurant in the green surroundings of the Botanical Garden. You have got the choice of different kind of seatings but Imrecommend the Western style.The service is very friendly and waiters can make good recommendations. The menu is Indonesian style, the name Blue Bali is program. You have got a long list of different cocktails and a good choice of wines. My highlight was the weat beer with some nice fruit taste.We had a couple of starters with chicken and fish as main courses. Everything was very tasty and portions were very good.Definitely a place to recommend and to come back at my next visit to Singapore.Congratulations to the management, a hidden gem among the long list of good restaurants in the vibrant city
4
Well ... I love this place in-spite of mosquito. Even at dinner time.I have a thick skin and Mosquito dont bother me much. But my wife and kids and too sensitive. Restaurant should do something about it.Having said that .. its one of the place we always plan to go.- Ambiance is something hard to find in Singapore- Open and Green- Friendly Staff. Easy going and courteous.- Food is good.- Value for money.- Parking could be a bit of a challenge.- Book in advance. Even though its huge .. but I am not the only one loving this place

Love the whole concept of the restaurant, especially their lil' huts. Was exceedingly pleased by a Balinese waitress, Pande, it was a pleasure to be served by Mr. Pande as he went the extra mile. Helping and meeting his customers needs. Really appreciate such service! The food was good but I thought it'll be great if there's more variety.

Beautiful carvings and true Balinese decor give this restaurant a wonderful atmosphere. The variety of beautiful foods and signature dishes made for a lovely experience. Beautifully cooked, served, and catering for a variety of palettes this was a unique experience

We did not enjoy the valentine buffet dinner at all! Dinner was less than an hour. Paying first at restaurant entry before dinner peeved me off. First time for me. There was zero service, no table napkin and melamine plates were used - no better than hawker centres! For the quality or food served with the $98 per couple price tag, this is not worth it! By the way the food is not all balinese nor authentic
5
Awesome service by very friendly staff. Together with the decor and the wonderful food, the staff add to the magnificent ambience and provided a wonderful dining experience, felt just like what i had experienced across Bali
5
The experience was incredible. We had been in Bali for Christmas last month and felt like we had been taken right back to the rice fields.
4
A lovely time experiencing the botanical gardens. We stopped for dinner which was lovely. Clean toilets, nice atmosphere, calm and serene!
4
Great service and extremely authentic feel of Bali. Would highly recommend others to experience it!!

Butter chicken, pumkin prawn and duck confit was great! Favourite was the pumkin prawn. Though dessert platter was for a good value, the desserts weren't that good.
5
Super service and foods - good atmosphere and choice. All food was excellent - Beef Rendang and Pumpkin Prawns superb.

This was the third tiem we ate here I believe and it was great again. We took some friends and had the Indonesian table + the seafood table. We always take the tables because it is easy to share with others and there's many different things on each. We loved everything, even up to the wine we chose to go along with it. Dessert was also a pleasant surprise as we took the dessert platter and it's definitely something you should try although you may not be able to finish it alone, more something to share as well. Great place
4
Very mixed service as we sat down with drinks menus for 15 minutes waiting and then had to chase to order drinks and ask for food menu. Then a woman got involved who was brilliant and rectified everything. Very good value, nice ambience and decent blue Bali beer. Recommend the Javanese satay and the samosas
2
If you are familiar with Indonesian food , do not go here you will be disappointed.Indifferent service, stupidly expensive for what it is ( 12SGD for a small bowl of stir fried kai lan !) The rendang was dry and tasteless , not not mention cold , the satay where bland and obviously cooked in the oven and not over a grill, the satay sauce - tasted like peanuts ground up in water, the other dishes where not much better. The Kia lan previously mentioned arrived long after everything else.General impression - needs a good clean , tatty laminated menus, poor food , bad service, stupidly over priced

We are always wondering where to go with kids, where both adults and kids find their space. I think blue Bali Fits that bill. Set in botanical gardens the restaurants open setting gives kids space to run around without being disturbing to others and the parents can enjoy a good meal. The food choice is extensive and is a boon for vegetarians as the menu boasts of many veg dishes. Mosquitoes are an issue, but the restaurant tries hard to mitigate with smoky repellents. And the management probably wants to look at keeping toilets smell free (this reduced the rating) This was my third visit and I am likely to go again

My wife had suggested Blue Bali as she had been before and enjoyed the location and food. We were warmly greeted on arrival and given choice of where to sit which was good. Although we could have gone a la carte the Christmas Eve buffet seemed both good value and had a fair range of options so three took that (one without alcohol). Our vegan daughter was adequatly taken care of and the waiter was good in explaining that one dish had dairy and could be removed.The buffet itself was $88 and given this included decent wines and soft drinks was great value (the price of wine in SGP is unbelievable). The choices in the buffet were Thai and Malay and quite ok. The pomelo salad wasn't that great as it was mainly chicken. However the rendang was fine and quite tender. Other dishes we had included stuffed chicken wings, satay and spring rolls. All fine although some dishes like satay don't do that well on a buffet. Staff were attentive throughout and only minor issue I had was the piped jazz music. I hate jazz music and its ubiquitous in SGP. However once it changed to tradiotional Gamelan my ear drums recovered.Overall this was a pleasant evening. The setting is quite different for SGP and offers good value particularly if you like a variety of Asian food types along with some wine
4
Great ambience, tasty food and pleasant service crew. The only downside was the presence of mosquitoes.
5
It's a great and romantic place to eat!
Employees are really available and so nice!
I recommend for everyone who wants to spend a lovely moment.
3
Friendly but very slow service. Food very good. We were welcomed and seated, but waited long time and had to ask several times to make an order. After ordering drinks and trying to make a food order the waiter excused himself and said he would have to come back, he was observed to go over to another table to take their order and did not return to us again for half an hour. By this time we managed to flag down another waiter to make our order.

You can actually forget you're living/dining in Singapore when you're at Blue Bali. Set next to the Botanic Gardens, the flora is lush and untamed, and all of the furniture and decoration is Indonesian. The food is great, and features both traditional Indonesian and Indian influenced by the Balinese Indian demographic. Great for a casual meal, or for a special occasion. Also features a bunch of craft beer
4
The Blu Bali makes a wonderful lunch spot while visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens. You can enter the pavilion from the Gardens, and enjoy an ambiance with lots of wood and warmth and an exotic decor. I thought the food was delicious.Drinking one of their hand crafted Pink Mamba beer, with the barbecued chicken and dessert while a rain shower passed was a highlight of my trip
3
We really were hoping the food would be great. The ambience and service were excellent. It really is a nice setting for a restaurant. The food though was only average. It was relatively bland. It wasn't bad, it was just average. I actually think we will go back but with lower expectations
1
Came here with friends...on first look loved it and was anticipating a satiating evening.... alas...came the food. Rather average and when I did tell the gentlemen who was serving us...unlike a good services standard...he would justify the awful food and then vanished for good.What an aweful waste of an awesome location
4
This is the first time I have been there. It's really very relax to sit there and enjoy food. The package is very valuable.

We booked Blue Bali in order to take advantage of the Gourmet Greens set menu.On arriving at the restaurant we asked for the menu and were given it, but were then approached by the manager (?) and told that if we ordered from this menu it would be very slow, as the restaurant was busy. He advised us to order from the main menu (which had about two thirds of the vegetarian choices on the set menu). This was disappointing as the booking had been taken with full knowledge that we wanted to try the set menu. Obviously we could have still ordered and accepted that it would arrive slowly, but we had a babysitter at home and didn't want to risk returning home very late at night.We ordered from the main menu, and waited. An hour later we still had not received our starters and followed up with the manager. Quickly, one of the starters arrived. We were then told the other had sold out. Again, disappointing because we had waited an hour and now only had one of our dishes. We ordered a substitute dish which did arrive quickly. I should add our waiter was very polite and did apologise. Towards the end of the meal the manager approached us and apologised for the experience, explaining how busy they were. This was fine, but presumably they know how many tables they have and how many covers they can cope with when taking bookings. It felt like they had over extended themselves and this meant the menu we had booked for and were looking forward to was not available (unless we wanted to wait 'a long time'). Regardless we ended up waiting. Overall we felt our experience was average, and whilst the food was ok, it wasn't really worth waiting so long for

I booked a Gourmet Greens menu (a set menu promo happening this week with 17 participating restaurants) for me and 2 of my friends last night, hoping to introduce them to a beautiful space and a good veg meal. There were many hiccups along the way that told me the restaurant was not ready to host Gourmet Greens Week, but all this was overlooked as we had a very pleasant and good-humoured waiter, who we believe is Indonesian, serving us. Halfway through though, we were served by another Indian gentlemen in a blue floral shirt, which led us to believe he was of senior rank in the service staff. He, though, was utterly appalling, and ruined the night for us. Here are a few reasons why:1. My order of soup was not delivered, so I asked for it after my friends had finished their bowls. When it finally arrived, it was completely different from what my friend had ordered. Mine came as a clear tom yam soup, my friend's was creamy. I called this man over and he said he would check. And then comes back to say that because he asked for it to be made in a rush that's why it came out like that. Instead of taking it back to the kitchen to get it fixed, he asked if I would accept the bowl of soup like this, since it was done in a rush - as if it was my fault that the mistake was done? I of course said no, and asked him how he could expect to serve a dish up the way it wasn't meant to be served. He brought it back w a v partonising 'Do you want to try it noooow?'. It came back with cream... lukewarm. they literally just poured cream in and stirred. 2. This man comes back later during the meal to ask how is everything. We said it was fine. and he proceeded to say (making obvious this was why he came to our table at all) that the Gourmet Greens Week menu was meant to have ended that night, and therefore they weren't even meant to serve it, and that's why they weren't prepared. Are you kidding me? I planned my meals around the Gourmet Greens week. I know when the promotion is meant to be on and I do not appreciate being lied to so that some incorrigible man on a power trip can have the last word/excuse. 3. At this point I was fuming. He had been patronising, rude, wrong, unapologetic, and now deceitful. So I quite curtly told him we're enjoying our dinner now and will he leave us alone. He then left in a tantrum he threw brazenly for us to witness. It's beautiful, the food is passable (when they get it right), but my god, avoid this wait staff as far as possibl

I love the Balinese feel here! A great place for dinner and a drink. I personally like the dirty duck and desserts. The service is also prompt and warm.
4
Great food, good service but rather high price. Went for lunxh though. Price may be okay for dinner

Located next to the fragrant garden in the Botanic Gardens (with a little side gate into the gardens right next to the restaurant so you can smell the nighttime fragrant flowers!)This is an outdoor terraced Bali themed restaurant with a very authentic teakwood jungle feel to it. Running water and stone statues amongst beautifully carved pagodas and luscious plants make the atmosphere special, particularly at night when the dimly lit restaurant can feel quite magical.Now for a few practicalities. A good selection of drinks, wines, cocktails and beers are available including the local special brew - Bali gold and other variations.As many others have commented the food is all right. A menu with various Asian cuisines, not just Indonesian (Thai, Indian dishes as well) and a very good set of vegetarian options are available. The rijstafel is a good option for 2 or 3. If you are with 3 hungry people you'll need extra portions. For 2 you probably just need the rijstafel and some nibbles with your drinks but no starters. For kids there is a kids menu with fish and chips, spaghetti, pasta with tomato sauce etc. good portions for the kids. The staff are good at advising what might be good options if you are not fully familiar with the dishes.The tables are almost all outside, fans provide a pleasant breeze but you won't be cold so careful what you wear! To keep the mosquitoes away the restaurant use the mosquito coils / smoke and so on a few tables near the edges you might find yourself occasionally being exposed to the smoke. If you are someone who gets bitten a lot consider covering up or wearing a repellant.The nicest tables for a romantic dinner are the 'huts' where you sit on the ground in traditional Indonesian style. There are also a whole selection of other options and seating styles so if you are really planning for a special night it might be worth coming by to choose the table in advance.Last time we ate here we arrived on the off chance on a Saturday night and were very lucky to get the last table but I'd suggest reserving ahead normally as it can get very busy.We found the service good and very attentive early in the evening (at 1830 when we arrived) but by 2000h they were clearly getting busier and the service became a little stretched and less responsive. For us the drinks and food came very quickly but it took us quite a long time to get our bill
3
Enjoyed a night out with some friends at Blue Bali. Dining outside in the garden is beautiful. Food quality was good. Service was rather slow unfortunately
4
Very nice ambiance...beautiful location. I would go early before sundown, order then take a short stroll thru the side gate into the botanic gardens. Food not so great, but let's just say your not paying premium for the food. It's all about the ambiance. Be sure to ask for a "hut", though there a min expenditure amount of $100.Will be back for sure
5
It was great from the food to the attentive staff value for money as well. The atmosphere was amazing it was like I was back in Bali. 
5
Yep, this one's actually INSIDE the Botanic Gardens - tucked away in a tropical forest, surrounded only by the sounds of nature and the wafting scent of incense burned at the edges of the restaurant.You can choose a traditional seating (cushions on the floor around a low table) or modern table, and the food never disappoints - the beef rendang is sublime, and the recommended beer pairings are spot-on. It's a great place for groups, but super romantic for couples as well.We like to think of Blue Bali as our "hidden secret" for when we have friends in town - but I'm willing to let the secret out so more people can patronize this amazing place. You won't regret it

I booked a table at blue Bali for a romantic birthday dinner, and the place had great atmosphere, I certainly wasn't disappointed. I asked and they moved us into one of the little private sitting-down areas (I don't know the name!) and were very happy. The food was good, and were very happy. The staff had been great up until then, but then we seemed to be forgotten about! We were trying to get someone's attention for another 10 minutes to order a cocktail and beer, but gave up on that. In the meantime it seems there was a 21st birthday party afew tables down which had taken the waiters attention. It wasn't rowdy, but a 10yr old girl had found the microphone and started to run around and attempt to sing very badly, as well as hit the microphone 50 times saying "testing". Very annoying. After getting up and finding a waiter, I requested the bill (I gave up on the beer), at which point the waiter became very helpful again, chatted for a bit, and promptly ordered us a cab. It is out the way a bit, so make sure you have a screen grab of the location of your phone if you're getting a taxi. Ours found it straight away though.Overall, a nice little unique restaurant, but a couple of things marred what was meant to end a perfect romantic night out
5
Volcanoes are going off everywhere and my flight to Bali just got cancelled (boo!) So instead my husband and I went to dinner at Blue Bali in the botanic gardens. It was a mid week night, very quiet, and we got to sit in a beautiful coushioned pavilion all by ourselves surrounded by plants and running water. Such a beautiful setting. We were totally able to pretend we were in Bali.We ordered the vegetarian Indonesian platter (huge) - amazing and we couldn't finish it. I got a mohito, again very nice - and then we ordered a dessert platter which again was great.Price is, well, pricey, but then this is Singapore, it's a huge restaurant and was about what I was expecting. Awesome spot for a romantic night out that is less polished Singapore and more colourful Balinese. Loved it, there should be more places like this in Singers
4
It took me a while to find this restaurant even with GPS, but once I got there, it's all good. The restaurant has a nice Bali feel, no AC but big fans to keep people cool in Singapore weather. Their menu has a diverse selection of food from South East Asia. The Jimbaran seafood flatter was so-so, a bit dry. My favorite was pumpkin prawns, very unique flavor. Can't wait to go back to have more
4
Relaxing seating, surrounded with greens. Nice house brewery beer is very enjoyable. Servis staff was kind, too :)
4
Food was excellent consistent with our previous experience. The ambiance was good. unusually very quiet. probably due to the haze
4
Nestled inside the botanical gardens, this place oozes of Balinese and Singaporean atmosphere. The food is good but nothing spectacular. But good enough the make the overall experience a strong recommendation to everyone searching for a casual night out.
4
We had the ristaffel which was superb. Maybe not quite enough for three (we didn't have starters) but almost. Anyway it's great value. The location is a little hard to find the first time but worth it, a secluded leafy oasis right next door to the botanic gardens. It really feels like another world, a mini vacation.
5
Booked Blue Bali as we wanted to spend an afternoon in Botanical Garden before heading out to Night Safari. Did not know anything of the place and when we got there it was complete empty (Thursday, 6pm). However, the staff was extremely helpful and chatty, the veggie food was fantastic (aloo gobi, paneer masala and thai green curry) and home-brewed Gold beer was good. Altogether an unexpected excellent experience. We paid 100 SingDollar for full meal with drinks
5
It was a memorable time for my wife. We celebrated her birthday with just family. The food is simply mouth watering, the presentation nothing less than fine dining, and the service fit for royalty! The final strawberry on the cake was the birthday cake, with real strawberries, left us all with a great time in a long time. Thank you Blue Bali!!
4
Really good food, a fabulous Nasi Goreng. Too much for my appetite . The restaurant is beautifully set in the Botanic gardens, in a lovely old house and garden. Surrounded by trees, lots of greenery in the garden and a lovely restful atmosphere, Amazed to find a micro brewery on site with good ales
5
It's a little hard to find, but I promise it's worth the effort. The butter chicken is out of this world and the Naan with whatever sauce they bring with it will make you want to cry it is so good. I have had green curry meals and they are amazing. The pumpkin prawns are terrific. Everything is great and the atmosphere is unmatched. Go. Drink wine. Enjoy.
4
We went there after a walk and a concert for piano and flute at the Shaw foundation stage set in the middle of the Botanical Gardens. As we took the path following the perfume of herbs we came across the back entrance of Blue Bali. It was impossible to resist: private wooden verandas with tables for 2-4 people with pillows -no shoes please! overlooking water canals. The definition of feng shui. We ordered nasi goreng which was delicious and some australian red wine from a limited production, Silene. We had a fantastic time, the service was excellent and we keep the best memories of that night out
5
Blue Bali is situated at the back of the a Botanic Gardens in the Uni Campus. Parking available. As soon as you walk inside, you feel like you are in Bali. High vaulted Balinese setting in the first section of the restaurant gives a great atmosphere. Further out are plenty more tables amongst trees and shrubs. Eclectic arrangement of tables and seating adds to the fun. We had entrees of prawn skewers and the samosas of which were the best we've ever had. I ordered pumpkin prawns - yum, korma curry was great, no disappointments. The cliche of a Singapore Sling is often disappointing but they served me a perfect one. Excellent service. We will return next visit.
3
Location is very good and so is the ambience, the food is overpriced for the quality. Under delivers
5
Food was excellent. Had mutton curry and selection of tapas. The service was good too. The ambience is great for a date.
3
I booked this restaurant to celebrate something special with my wife. We arrived early, and offered a few places. 1 cabana place requires minimum spent of $100, the rest doesn't need minimum spent. We decided to sit in the middle of the restaurant. The ambient is really great, we are hearing balinese music and feel like in bali itself.The menu started with beers, and wines, we ordered the bali beer and pinky beer. However both is not to our liking, as it is much bitter compared to other local brands. We also ordered tapas: home made tofu (this one is a MUST try, so heavenly and tasty), soto ayam (so-so), gado-gado (nothing special), and the last one was grilled tiger prawn (really good .. and worth the money).So there you go, the restaurant is a bit on the high side, but the location and theme is really inviting for romantic dinner. Service is very attentive and good
4
Samys Curry was closed on a Tuesday night so taking the local suggestions we hopped in a cab and hightailed it over to Blue Bali. ...initially it looked empty but outside under the Balinese canopy it was humming!Friendly and attentive staff was a good start and the same calibre continued all night with recommendations for the player for two skeptically accepted we were thinking about additional dishes and/or desert.... Until it arrived. ... uh sorry we doubted you. .. and it may have been the generous offer of a 2nd (and third) pint of home brew for $6 that filled the gap but we just could not finish the mountain of indonesian delicacies that overflowed onto our plates...No details required... just go, trust the waitperson, order, enjoy, roll out the door and then spend the next day walking it off... you wont regret it
5
Last night We celebrated My grandson's 13 birthday at Blue Bali. The food, ambience, service, friendliness of all staff was just 100%. We had roast and butter chicken ( my grandson's favourite) we also had steamed whole fish which was mouth watering delicious. My son ordered vegetable green curry........also good, oh and I think there was chicken sate and vegetable samosas, which must have been good as they were demolished before I could have a taste. Even a birthday cake with candles was supplied. A big Thank you to all the staff. nothing more could have been done to ensure our little celebration was a memorable one. Blue Bali deserves its success. It really is an oasis in a noisy and busy Singapore. Will return very soon to eperience the rest of the menu! Fantastic place. A great find
4
It is a very romantic place to dine at, with exquisite exotic decor and soothing ambience in the surrounding lush greenery. The food is above average and the so are the prices. 3 of us paid $60 each for a drink, a platter (80$++) and a plate of gado-gado. For the ambience, the damage done to the wallet is worth it but not a place, I can go often
5
I got a reference for this place from a former classmate while on a visit from the U.S. This place was the best I have had in my teleological weeks in Asia thus far. The atmosphere was great, the service was prompt and attentive, and the food was to die for. We loved it. I will make this a staple. We had butter chicken, chicken satay, and pumpkin shrimp (along with some Naan). Can't speak to the rest of the menu, but those items were unbelievably good. Read about some issues getting here. Who cares...get lost for a few minutes, enjoy the sights, and when you get there enjoy the experience. P.S. If you want high end swanky don't go. If you want atmosphere and amazing food this is your place
2
Firstly this restaurant is not too easy to find even with a local taxi driver. It's in a unique lovely environment and the menu looks enticing. However the food was extremely bland and disappointing nothing like eating in Indonesia. Service was poor as we were never sure who our waiter was. There are many more fabulous restaurants to experience as a local or tourist. Don't waste your time and money going here.
4
This was my 4th visit to Blue Bali. All occasions have been for visits related business trip by clients. The place is set near to NUS campus. It is surrounded by lush greenery. It can be bit difficult to find it in the first place. I have experienced problems especially when taxi drivers come to pick you up. Once you get there the place is really amazing. They have indoor option for parties with two spacious halls. The open Garden restaurant is more for small get togethers & private dinners. The staff is very friendly & traditionally dressed in Bali style. The food options are many. On all our visits we have tried the platters which come in different varieties like Indian, Indonesian etc. the quantity is good. The items are also well chosen including mix of rice, curry, vegetables, pappadam / crackers, spring rolls etc. the menu is well designed to cater to vegetarian as well as non veg foodies. The place is not really crowded and you can have some peaceful dinners with good food. For sure you will be satisfied with the service, quality & quantity of food. Highly recommended. I am sure to visit this place again jn future.
5
I've been there for a romantic dinner and was very surprised by the quality of service and food. I love Bali, the environment, the people, the lighting... and I was not disappointed: staff is super helpful (especially with fans and mosquitos repellent), polite and smiling, food is very good quality and tasty, environment is very relaxing with cushions and our own "tent". Highly recommendedVery little bad point, my hubby took me there for a surprise dinner and booked in advanced but the waiter came to introduce us what was included in the romantic package and said the price of the package :
5
Service is great and good is fantastic. Tranquil surrounding make for a unique experience.
The only drawback is the wifi support. So, if business meetings are being held there, backup mifis need to be prepared.
4
Cosy and quiet place to have a romantic dinner date with my boyfriend. Staff were pleasingly attentive and polite. Delicious food and drool-worthy beers.
5
A friend had recommended Blue Bali, and my husband and I ate there with two other couples on a Saturday night. We ordered a platter and four other dishes to share, and it was more than enough food - all delicious (the beef rendang was my favorite)! The service was good and I loved the ambiance. It really did feel like we had left urban Singapore for the evening. I will be back, and highly recommend it
5
Two Saturdays back, we had our first dinner at Blue Bali & were blown away by the fantastic service, incredible food, drinks & unique atmosphere. Picture a garden of plants, running water, croaking frogs, burning incense & old statuesIt was a magical evening, as we had some of our closest friends visiting us over the weekend from Hong Kong, which made the explore together evening that more special. The best part is, we are big fans of Ubud in Bali & this was a slice of that right on our door step.We could not even decide which part of the meal was the best, as all the dishes were thoroughly attacked. Being four of us (three of the biggest foodies I know! :), we ordered the Indonesian Rijsttafel Platter & built a few side orders around that. Range of the offering & different tastes was incredible There was a great presentation of each dish by Christopher, extra service by Andrew & all in the palm of Indah's lovely hospitality who kept checking in to make sure we were happy as can be. Also many thanks to Robin who helped us with our booking.Its now definitely our favorite restaurant in Singapore, and its terrific that its right next to the Old Botanical Gardens where one can catch a stroll before dinner. Enjoy
5
We dined here and had a great meal and experience. The staff are very friendly and give great service, nothing was too much trouble. The food was very good and we had plenty to eat. The ambience was lovely, the music, decor and overall style was very appealing.It's set in the Botanic Gardens and we highly recommend eating there.Enjoy
3
Wonderful place. Awesome food. We were a party of 16 and seated at the far end of the restaurant. Service was slow but the staff was friendly when they came by.But, at least 4 of us went home with horrible sandflies bites. It's been three days and it's terribly itchy. Beware
4
This place looks like bali and smells like bali, you really do feel that you are out of the busty Singapore. I would give 10/10 for the environment. The outdoor dining area is like a little garden, with gazebo, Balinese music, deco.... Words can't describe how amazing this place looks like. Despite the heat, I chose to sit outdoor because that's the only way to have a complete experience of my meal. I took the three course lunch menu at $25. To me, it's worth it. The peanut sauce in my Gado Gado needs improvement, I can make a better one in my bali cooking class. Ayam Bakar was good, the chicken fillet is tender. The restaurant even provided me with white rice for free because I told them that I don't like rice cake. I had doubts on Pandan cream brûlée when I ordered it, it turned out to be my favourite dish! A smaller spoon could be used because I was unable to reach the bottom using the spoon they gave. Service was prompt and welcoming as well, probably because there were not many guests coming for weekday lunch. They asked for feedback when I paid my bill, which is a good gesture. I will come back to try other dishes
5
The ambience is fantastic. The deco gives you the feeling of being in Bali. A really quiet places nestled in the heart of city. The servings are generous. If you are a crab lover, do call a day in advance to order. I believe it is worth a try. The food I had was simply delicious!

I booked a table for my partner's 50th birthday several weeks in advance and asked if we could be put in the most romantic and beautiful setting for us. I was told "of course". On arriving at the restaurant, the manager barely made eye contact with us, checked the booking sheet and then wondered through the restaurant looking for a table. He randomly stopped at a table for two in the highest lit and high traffic area and said "how about here?" - no reservation ticket on it. Worst table in the restaurant, despite there being free tables in other places. I reminded him of my booking request for a romantic table and found one myself - to which he said, "yes you can sit there". We then sat at our table (which was one of the gorgeous low sitting balinese tables) - and were promptly ignored for the next 15 minutes until we finally got someones attention and were asked "did we need something?" - yes...a drink to start with would be nice! We ordered our starters a little bit later and then called for more attention to order our mains. The wine in the ice bucket stand off to the side, we kept having to go over and get to refill ourselves. For the main dish, I had Alam Bakar, which was the toughest and stringiest chicken I have had for a while - and difficult to eat. Particularly as I wasn't given a knife. The Rogan Josh was average. Whilst the setting was lovely, the service and food was well below average
4
Our daughter had enjoyed cocktails and tapas here previously so she took us to Blue Bali for dinner. It was a delightful evening, the welcome was warm, the service excellent and unobtrusive.We sampled tender tofu with chili sauce from the tapas menu and some delicious satay. The mains we enjoyed included exemplary beef rendang, butter chicken,nazi goreng and best of all and new to me prawns in a pumpkin sauce!The ambiance and surroundings are charming and we shall certainly return when we are next in Singapore
3
The menu was extensive and the food was reasonably tasty. The service was poor. Water was served much after the food was served. Ordered wine by the glass. The open bottle was not well preserved.
4
Really enjoyed our evening at Blue Bali with another couple. The gentlemen liked the beer quite a bit. We ordered a few tapas to start and then shared the Indian platter. We were very well satisfied with the portions and taste of our meal. Service was good for Singapore. We have booked our next visit with guests from the US. I hope this little taste of Bali makes them want to visit and experience the true Bali. Cheers
5
We have been here a few times and love it every time we visit. The atmosphere feels like being in Bali and the food is very authentic.We love the light naan bread with the delicious curry sauce. The roast duck was perfect.Great place to ea
5
This is one of the places id recommend for a fine dining restaurant ... It is not too easy to get to so you would either have to drive there or take a cab ... As soon as you enter the restaurant it just takes you away from the modern city of Singapore into something into a place which is serene calm and peaceful,, It does indeed feel like you are in Bali, there is a lot of greenery around, wodden architecture and stone idols like they have in Bali.... They have their own brewery which i felt was worth a try, the beers were quite nice ... I had gone with a few of my colleagues, about a dozen of us and the final tab came to just over 1300 SGD which is a bit on the pricey side but this place isnt going to be easy on your wallet... I would say they are good value for the money spent ... The service was quite nice, polite and prompt ... Food quality was excellent and so was the size of the portions they provide ... They have quite an extensive menu so everyone eventually finds what they want to eat ... Its a nice place for couples, families or to entertain visiting business colleagues ..

On the recommendation of a friend, we dined with a colleague at Blue Bali last evening. What a special experience! I easily made our reservation online with a prompt response. The relaxed ambience is very Balinese with its multi-colored fabrics and lanterns, private dining pavilions with cushions and low tables as well as tables and chairs, soft traditional background music, wafting incense, and open-air feel while maintaining comfort with fans. For a starter, we enjoyed a lychee cocktail, red wine, and a beer along with sautéed prawns topped with a delightfully flavorful mango salsa. Our entrée was a shared Indonesian Rijsttafel platter and a tapas order of grilled pumpkin prawns. The platter was ample food for three diners, and the flavors of each dish (there were nine) were delicious. From prior reviews, we knew to save dessert room for the Mango and Sticky Rice Pudding – truly one of the best desserts I have had. The rice was buttery and slightly salty, playing perfectly off the sweetness of the mango. Service was attentive but not obtrusive. All in all, a delightful evening “in Bali”

The ambience of this restaurant is exquisite. Close to the fragrance garden, with fountains and lovely outdoor dining. The staff are friendly, welcoming and efficient. The food, however, is disappointing. Large portions but not as exquisite as the setting, coarser, less interesting. Especially as it is quite pricey

Blue Bali is a restaurant located inside the botanical gardens and has a fairly unique and nice ambience. The open air deck has a nestled between a lot of greenery. The food is multi cuisine - and I found it quite average - however the desserts - Mango and sticky rice pudding as well as the Panacota that we ordered were fabulous

Friends who live in Singapore heard about this restaurant and booked a dinner for us. Loved the interior (is on the NUS campus. Glad I didn't have to find the location) and the food was very good (while the Beef Rendang was very good, could have been a bit spicier). One thing Singapore isn't short of is great places to eat. If you're looking for a new and slightly different experience, Blue Bali is definitely a great destination

The place is very Wonderful. I totally feel like I'm in bali! It is very relaxing and enjoyable. Came here for birthday celebration and we got a 'hut' with 2 canopy bed. Food was delicious too! Service is superb. They even sang birthday song with me
4
Went with our family. The service was good, the location was a bit out of the way, but parking was cheap. The kids menu is decent and the portions are large (we split one plate between our two kids). The tapas menu is great. It also has a vegetarian portion. We ate very well for $70. Good tasting food, large portions, and great ambience

Great place and ambience in Singapore. A great remembrance of Bali. Very attentive service and food was great.

Eat here on invitation from our singapore office.
Simply, you cannot mix rendang with urap ( mix vagetable) using peanut souce instead of coconut grater, and the sate ayam is to big to chew.
Maybe this happen because our local singapore guys "mistaken" combining menu.

Location is very very nice. at the same time this can be a bit of an issue also. this is situated within the NUS campus. easiest way in is to take the left on Bukit Timah road after Evans Road if you are coming from the city side - head for the Lee Kwan Yew school, the NUSS Guild room and the law school and it is just there.very quiet setting. very relaxing. the decor is very nice. it is a grand old building. the restaurant is on the first floor and actually outside the building - at the back. the first floor has function rooms. it is all done up in the indonesian warung style but has both traditional warung as well as european tables and chair settings. might get a bit hot although there seemed to be adequate fans around to cool you down. the service is a tad unprofessional although the captain does his best and is very helpful. the food is very nice. they serve indonesian and indian food. did not understand where the indian food angle came from - why it is present as everything else seems to be focussed on the indonesian part. the taste is authentic. this more true for the indonesian part of the menu than the indian. we were 8 of us and had 13 drinks plus quite a lot of food for only $550.a reservation is suggested. must try if just for the setting. a bit out of the way from the regular stuff
4
Food was excellent, especially the platter which is worth having over a main course. The dessert platter was enjoyed by all, there were four of us and we also had the Bali Gold Brew, sweet taste so not to everyone's pallet. Restaurant in good setting, typical Malay house. If you are there for a romantic time then get a pagoda table if that's what they were called? Higher table with sides, no chairs but cushions. Service was a little slow in bringing the drinks, we asked three times in 15 minutes. Just a tip, this place is on Cluny Road past Jacob's, right next to the sports field but the taxi drivers we have (2) needed directions, luckily we had a Singapore mobile with maps or the data roaming charges would have been enormous

It was our 2nd visit to Blue Bali. ...The ambience of the restaurant and the beautiful setting brought us back. Our first experience in May last year was disappointing with regards to service and food quality. But it seems that things have changed around for the better. I received an email from the restaurant introducing me to the specialities as soon as I made the online reservation. The food was great... tandoori broccoli and the japit goreng (prawns) were fantastic and the service was exceptional. I have to say the service was infact, one of the best I've seen in Singapore. We'll definitely be returning for another lovely evening at Blue Bali.

This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend at work. It is not a place I would naturally enter just walking by. One, it’s located inside the Botanical Gardens so it is at risk of being an overpriced tourist restaurants. Two, the menu contains multiple full page professionally designed ads recommended which wine and beer to pair with your food, which felt very pushy. Fortunately, this was not the case and the food turned out to be pretty decent.For dinner, we ordered a spicy salad that was topped with chicken, a BBQ Snapper and the beef rendang. For desert we ordered the deep fried bananas and the mango sticky rice. Our favourite dishes were the salad, the BBQ snapper, the deep fried bananas and the mango sticky rice. The beef rendang was OK, but the beef felt a little overcooked. The restaurant atmosphere was also good. We sat outside. The dining area had, as might expect, a Bali-esque style that was calming. The service was also decent. Nothing to rave home about, but met expectations. We also ordered the craft-beer on tap, which they call nano-brewed beer . It was good and priced similar to what you’d get at Brewerkz. For me, it wasn't worth it, but that has nothing to do with quality. I just fine beer in Singapore way too expensive and rather save my money for a night out of just craft-beer drinking instead of just one for dinner. Overall, if you’re in the botanical gardens and you’re looking to close your day with some decent food. I think this is a good choice

We went to this lesser known restaurant in bukit timah road. The ambience was very nice and refreshing. You hardly get to see this resorts types restaurant in city. We took the hut which has min spend of100$ and it was worth.It's very good for couples as they can enjoy there time without much hinderance.The service was a bit slow as the restaurant is so big but it was worth wait as the food was great n value for money. Would love to go again
5
Even as you enter, the ambience & interior decor takes your breath away! The welcoming staff add to the positivity and the fare which follows gives your taste buds quite a tickle! The place is great for children to roam around & the friendly staff keep them engaged as well. I've never been to Bali but if this is what's on offer there, I better make my reservations fast! The subtle lighting at night time adds to the allure of the place
2
We have had lunch here.It looks very tastefull but the taste is not that special. The beans we had next to the redang beef were allmost raw and the other food is missing a bite. Yuo would expect a good quality if you look at the price level. So; it looks good but the taste is below expectations. Just walk to an other place for a good lunch or diner
4
Great ambience, most tables are actually little gazebos where u eat on a coffee table. Very nice. Food was excellent, service was really slow on a Saturday night, yet extremely friendly. Their tapas selection is a great idea for sharing.My personal tip of choosing a table: make sure there is a wall or something behind you for you to sit against, otherwise you may quickly feel in comfortable
5
Blue Bali delivers yet again... great ambience; it's like being transported to Bali, food was superb and service was simply authentic! We will be back again (5th visit) and tell others about you:)
5
Nice place, food was good although more on the pricy side. Need to have more cover on the outdoor side especially lesehan area to prevent wet shoes.
4
Watch out it's closed on Monday. I was disappointed when i drove there and found it's closed. Look at website for timings before you plan your visit...
2
The venue is nice but there is no service at all in this place. We had a group of 10 with all of waiving our arms trying to get the service to come but no luck so every time we needed some thing we had to get up and go to the bar and order. For the price they charge the food is just so so and quite oily. Won't be coming back here again, there are better places to go in Singapore. Plus its very hot and humid and not enough fans. We were all sticky and sweaty by the end of it which made it uncomfortable
5
I went to Blue Bali very recently with a group of 10 after a walk round Botanic Gardens.We phoned up at short notice on a Sunday evening to get a table - this was not a problem for the mngt.It is next to the top end of Botanic- you'll need to walk about 10 mins round the top - it is located near the law faculty at the Uni... a little set back / secluded but worth it.Wow! - I was really impressed by the setting - very peaceful and lush, lovely areas to eat outside, nice and secluded ... rather nicer than Dempsey in my opinion.The food is a mix of Balinese and Asian ( maybe some western dishes .. cant remember).I had the pumpkin and prawn soup starter .. really good, followed by beef Rendang - also good.In fact all of us enjoyed the food we had .. and pricing is quite reasonable.The beer is also excellent - they have 'own brewed' beers and IPA at $10++ ( good for Singapore) .. I had a couple of IPAs. others had lager / cocktails.I was really pleasantly surprised by my experience here .. I would recommend this place for a good quality balinese meal in a quiet relaxed setting, with good service ( and good value too). For a really nice starter, main course , and 2 large beers - the bill was less than $70 .. good value for Singapore ( and most places), for this quality of food and setting. ( I have had some rather dire / average meals elsewhere for around this much in Singapore )starters were around $8-15++ , mains 20-25 or so ++ ..very reasonable IMOIts not a loud/noisy/ music driven venue like some of the places at boat quay or dempsey ( so it suits me fine :)

Had dinner there tonight (28/10) and was impressed on a number of levels. Staff attentive but almost invisible when not looking after you, menu was interesting and varied, and the food quality was excellent. Add to that the ambience, tables with decent gaps to give the illusion of separation, the variety of seating styles and the boutique beer all added up to a fantastic dining experience.This place works as a romantic dinner for two or a party of 10 having beer and Tapa

Celebrated my fiancÃ©'s 25th birthday.Def love the ambience over at blue Bali. Took quite some time to reached the place- confusing but yet it's a worth trip to the place.Was pretty amazed by the portion of foods that was served on that night. Big serving and we(11pax) can barely finished the foods. Dinner was good, although it's a lil bit pricey. Spent closed to 500$ for 11pax. Worth the dinner ! :) Don't really have to wait for long- seated , ordered - less den 20mins all foods was served on the table. We had 2 platters and individual main dishes each. Love the ambience - the fast services and them(waitress) served us w a smiles. All is good. Will patronized the place again definitely! Thank you for the hospitality !

I was invited by business associated for dinner at this restaurant. I was kindly reminded by the locals that the restaurant was situated in a rather concealed spot where not a lot of taxi drivers knew its exact location.Having called the restaurant for a detailed direction I was taken there on a taxi without too much trouble. Address of the restaurant alone wouldn't help, and it's much better to direct the taxi driver to enter into the National University of Singapore Bukit Timah campus, and the restaurant would be found at the back of it on Cluny road. Better even is to keep the restaurant telephone number with you so that the driver would be able to call when necessary for detailed direction.The dining area was nicely set and spread in semi outdoor area surrounded by nice plants and vegetation. Tables were placed away from each other so a certain level of privacy was guaranteed. Given myself too much time to cater of the difficult-to-find location, I ended up arrived in the place 20+ minutes earlier than the booking time. The receptionist showed me to a very small coffee table for two, while the booking was dinner for 3 adults! I then asked for a change to another one, and the guy just pointed at a vacant one at a distance and disappeared immediately. He was not amused of my request obviously and I was made to wait for 20 minutes before someone came by asking if I need some drinks!The restaurant offered Indonesian and Thai cuisine, and I order a soup for appetizer and prawns in pumpkin sauce as main, neither very Thai nor very Indonesian. The other guest had a typical Indonesian dish of beef rendang while our host ordered the most weird dish in an Indonesian restaurant---duck confit !!!Taste of food was fine but not outstanding, and the portion appeared to be on the small side. One might be disappointed if coming specially for good Indonesian cuisine. This would be a place of nice ambience to have a meal and talk in a rather relaxed surrounding, if you don't mind the lack of quality service and comparatively high price.One thing to mention: my chair was a hard wood one which one would feel rather uncomfortable sitting on it for a prolonged period of time. Amusingly I was offered a thin cushion after I finished my dinner and was about to leave! Thoughtfulness wasn't it

Having read some of the mixed reviews of this restaurant on trip advisor citing bland food and poor service, we were a little apprehensive of visiting but are very glad we did! In our view, the service was perfect - attentive without being intrusive. The food was fantastic - we shared a starter of mango prawns which were fresh, well flavoured and beautifully presented. I had the rendang curry (a favourite of mine from trips to Indonesia) and it was fragrant, spicy but not overly and accompanied by lovely rice and beans. My wife had papaya prawns as a main and she is still enthusing about it now.So overall, highly recommended by us as a place worth visiting; the food was excellent and the "middle of the tropical forest" location just adds to the experience. Our taxi driver had no problems finding it as well
3
The place was great! nicely done, and a fantastic atmosphere, true to the spirit of Bali. The food was quite nice and provided a wide range of choices. Suitable for vegetarians. The service was very poor, the waiters were very polite, however, the person taking our order was quite rude to the point of us considering to leave! Hope they get better, you would not want the experience of visiting blue bali leaving a bad taste due to a few ill-mannered people.

What a find not far from Orchard Road but a back in time in an oasis of calm. So nice to leave the hustle and bustle and eat outdoors with the crickets in an open wooden shelter with the crickets chirping. Food was amazing. We had the satay which were out of the world tender and the seafood platter. I had to lick the fish bones clean it was so tasty.
5
This has to be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. It has the same relaxing ambience as being holiday, with incense lingering in the background, and comfortable, cosy furnishings, and very attentive staff. You can enjoy a most relaxing evening in this place, eat their wonderful Indonesian food which has a great selection, especially for vegetarians (the butter paneer is amazing!), and if you are lucky drink their micro-brewery beer which is delicious. The only problem with this restaurant is that many taxi drivers have no idea how to get there, so its worth having the restaurants number handy so you can call them once you get lost. It is also worth booking a table because it really gets busy, especially at the weekend
2
The first thing that disappointed us, was the advertised in-house special beer brews were not available on the day (a Friday). If not anything the restaurant should stock adequately the highly advertised in-house brews. The cocktails were below average and had to be corrected. Food was also average. The waiters should make an effort to explain various Balinese dishes to the customers.Only thing commendable is that they played a mini orchestra to celebrate birthdays. Surely a lot of room for improvement at this fine dining place

The Beau and I decided to head to Blue Bali on Cluny (formerly known as "The Villa Bali") for dinner this evening, so we could indulge in Balinese food with a modern twist. I just had to keep snapping photos of the place because it was so pretty, like a charming little world of its own nestled at the edge of Botanical Gardens. Located at 1D Cluny Road, Singapore 259600, the number to dial for Blue Bali is 6733 0185. It is a quaint little bungalow, one of those "black-and-white houses" that the Beau liked, very colonial and historical. The restaurant is furnished in a grand, elegant Balinese style complete with authentic ornaments / art deco furniture that adorns its every surface.There were various dining halls in this great courtyard gardens- setting, one could choose the air-conditioned indoors, or dine close to nature alfresco-style, enjoying being surrounding by the trees and plants, listening to insects and soothing music all night long. There were traditional Javanese Joglos, Lesehans and daybeds etc - we wanted to dine in one of the tents / huts but were told that the total bill had to exceed SGD100+. We should've chosen it since our bill exceeded that amount in the end too!Next, we were being served the Pumpkin Prawns (SGD$20.00) - succulent prawns stir-fried in a creamy Blue Bali signature sauce delicately infused with curry leaf and chilli. I loved the fresh, bouncy prawns enhanced by the sweet, sandy (like salted-egg texture) sweet flavor of the creamy pumpkin-concocted gravy. It was deliciously-tinged with curry's aroma, and I kept drinking the gravy like soup, simply because it was lovely, and non-greasy.Then there was the Sumatra Beef Rendang (SGD25.00) - beef loin braised with rendang paste flavored with Salem leaf, lemongrass, star anise, cinnamon and served with Nasi Kuning and Lawar Kacang (Balinese long beans). The beef rendang was sapid and heavy in flavor - sweet, savoury and spicy blend all in one, infusing the naturally rich flavor of the beef. The rice was fragrant like nasi lemak or saffron rice's taste, going very well with the beef, and the spicy long beans added a hint of refreshing crunch to the dish. The chilli served with this dish was superb too!Our final main course for sharing was the Blue Bali Dirty Duck Confit (SGD$28.00) - a tradition in Bali married with an age-old French recipe of preserved duck leg prepared with Indonesian spices and served with Mesclun salad and spicy Hoisin sauce. It was duck confit in French restaurants literally - crispy on the inside and tender on the inside - except that this was uniquely flavored with spices unfound in French restaurants - and we loved this dish, needless to say!For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/07/dinner-at-blue-bali-on-cluny.htm

We came on Sunday evening and it was the perfect way to end the weekend. The relaxed garden setting immediately evoked a feeling of tropical balinese serenity, and for a couple of hours it transports you away from the busy city of Singapore. Both my partner and I love Indonesian food so decided to share their platter in order to taste a few different dishes. This was a good choice (if you cant make up your mind either) and left two people very full!! We were really happy with our experience and will definitely be back
5
Tricky to find but a gr8 place for a meal with friends if you want something a little different. Lovely decor, pleasant staff and good eats ... 8 of us shared 3 platters (Indonesian, seafood & Indian) and it was enough. Only one beer (Balinese) on offer. Note that there is traditional seating but also regular tables and chairs.... So if you have difficulty sitting cross-legged for long periods of time, ask for the latter
3
Not only they bring the Balinese music and architecture and interior style to Singapore, they also bring real Balinese people for the waiter/waitress. We didn't order Balinese food (can't remember if they had babi guling/suckling pig there anyway) but ordered some other signature Indonesian food (rendang, gado gado, chicken satay, roasted chicken). The food was so-so but the chicken satay was really good (juicy meat and yummy peanut sauce). We didn't order their beer but their Blue Bali signature cocktail was good
2
I heard about this nanobrewery in Singapore and decided to give it a try. They had 3 of their own brews on tap when I visited;Bali Gold - Pumpkin Golden Ale, Pink Mamba - Witbier with red dragon fruit and Doshi - Zeus IPA.Between my girlfriend and myself. We had the Pink Mamba, not bad, extremely refreshing, great for the local weather. And the Doshi - claimed to be "majestically hopped" and "spectacular" but extremely disappointing. It had loads of old hop flavour and had almost no hop aroma. I thought they might have had a bad batch or line infection and raised it up with the duty manager, who could not provide a satisfactory answer and just said that the brewmaster was not around and he himself was unable to try the beer to verify if my taste buds were functioning correctly. I was extremely disappointed as I had expected a lot more from this place as I feel that joints like these contribute greatly to our local brewing scene. Hopefully, when I do come back, they can sort this out.

Yes its true that its not easy to find. Quite out of the main city , located in the university campus.But trust me , once you reach, you will love it. The route is lush green and there is fresh air all around the place. I went to attend a party and food was decent.To my surprise , Indian veg food they served exceeded my expectations
4
This place is not so easy to find. When you are in the Botanic Gardens you have to make quite a detour. Wish there was an entrance from the garden to it.The restaurant has a happy hour between 17:00 and 20:00, but be sure to order the correct drink and glasssize, or you miss out.The food looked slightly better on the pictures, but was tasty and i felt satisfied. There was enough choice of vegetarian options. I would come back if it was closer to my hotel
3
The decor, the atmosphere, the old building, right down to the music brings Bali to Singapore. They brew their own beer which is light and refreshing and goes for $14++ for the first pint and $6++ for the second. Food was a let down, satay was tough and the duck didn't live up to the Bali bebek standards
4
Yes, those of us who like to be transported away from the hotels, mundane eateries in malls and food courts will delight in this place. Good juices, drinks and food! atmosphere is sublime- sit by water, up a dais or tables by balconies that look into an eternity of trees.Just sit back and relax, enjoy the good service....
4
I have been a regular patron of Blue Bali, even before they moved and renamed themselves from Villa Bali.I love Bali and the rustic, cosy atmosphere that integrates nature with serenity - and Blue Bali delivers just that without having to leave the country.The food is fantastic. Service needs major improvement, perhaps they were too overwhelmed with customers and orders.This is truly an establishment I will never stop supporting
4
The location is surprising as it's within the university grounds, but well worth any confusion getting there. Great setting underneath a pavilion and pleasant to be sitting outside. We were 3 adults and 2 children and the kids meals were of a reasonable standard. The pumpkin prawns are amazing, and the Indian platter to share was a really good mix of choices and flavours.

Found the place after second taxi attempt - first cab dropped us at the entrance of Botanic Garden which was beginning of Cluny Road (presumably #1). Second cab attempt with GPs took us into the NUS compound to look for #1D.The building looked a bit deserted from the outside but once you enter the proper restaurant, the atmopshere reminds us of laidback days sitting in the verandah, enjoying the cool evening breeze and spending time with friend and family.Keen to try some authentic Balinese cuisine, we ordered the Indonesian Platter and some fried tofu for starters. I suppose this is when the magic stops. The tofu was deep fried drenched with sweet chilli sauce. The platter contained chicken curry, beef rendang, otak otak (fish pieces instead of paste), chicken satay and seafood on lemongrass stick, dried chicken breast floss and mixed blanched vegy. There were three sauces provided as dips on the side. Overall the taste was quite ordinary and did not exhibit any exceptional Balinese spice or flavors. Service was attentive - the staff kept coming back to check on our drinks. However, definitely more work required to complete the Balinese experience

If you are catching a cab to Blue Bali, your initial challenge is to direct the cab driver where it is as the address 1D isn't exactly easy to find. The restaurant is on Cluny Road (NUS end) passing both entrances to the Botanic Gardens .As you enter Blue Bali, the ambiance, furniture and design certainly casts you back to the lush beautiful Bali scenery, feel and atmosphere. Hidden among the greenery, it is a relaxing and quiet setting. Blue Bali's menu offers a variety of Indonesian food (from satay, rendang, chendol) and International cuisine (to steak, creme brulee) to cater for the different guests. Balinese cuisine are generally full of flavours and spices. One may ask, where is the Balinese all-time favourite Babi Guling? With the amount of effort put in on the ambiance, unfortunately, we found the dishes to be very disappointing. The flavours/ spices were bland and the quality to be sub-standard at premium prices. Perhaps the premium prices contributes towards the ambiance. Service wise, it was generally ok.Blue Bali has a nano-brewery onsite for its hand-crafted beers. It's ranges are generally sweet base. Pink Mumba is a lighter and sweeter beer with a very light dragon-fruit flavour - a favourite among the ladies. Doshi is its in-house IPA, nice sweet bitterness catered for the asian palate.On overall, thumbs up for the Bali ambiance, improvement on it's food offering/ flavours would definitely boost the entire experience
1
We read excellent reviews and were sorely disappointed by the experience. The building is magnificent and builds momentum.in terms of expectations.We were there on a date with my wife. The service was not getting it right. There was no timely delivery of our dishes. My starter arrived early. My wife was late. By the time i finished my starter, I welcomed my mains. My wife was still at her starter.The food was ok but will be quickly forgotten

I think to describe this restaurant as average is being very kind. FIrst of all - the good points, I have to admit that the setting is lovely and a true touch of Bali. We invited friends there this evening as part of SIngapore Restaurant week and we were greeted by a truly disappointing display of sub standard service. The staff looked out of their depth, they had very little idea of how to control the flow of a restaurant and created an atmosphere of tension and anxiety. Every order was going to the wrong table and it seemed that the only way to get food was to recognise a passing waiter's tray and advise him to drop off the food at your table. We were surrounded by people who were frustrated and demanding their food but also some people who were more relaxed and patient who were still waiting for their food an hour after ordering. Our four main courses were brought 5-10 minutes apart, and we had to remind them repeatedly that we were still waiting for each remaining main. My wife waiting 30 minuted for a glass of house wine despite reminding them several timesThe food was ok but nothing that was worth returning for, for such good reviews in the past we were amazed at how a restaurant can get it so wrong on Friday of Restaurant week - this is when you are meant to be showcasing your culinary skills and service standard
5
We visited as part of Restaurant Week 2013, and glad we did as otherwise we probably never would have found it. The restaurant is tucked away at the back of NUS (use google maps to direct the taxi driver), and once you arrive is in a beautiful setting with a very spacious seating area at the back. The decor is very Balinese and with the lush greenery everywhere you can easily close your eyes and pretend you're in Bali. The menu is a good selection of Asian favourites and everything we tried was really tasty. Service was impeccable. And as an aside, living close by the owner drove us home afterwards - you don't get that very often! Will certainly be back

Great location in the midst of lots of trees. The seating is superb, with low tables also available. There was good food choices, including some for the vegetarians as well. A great experience
