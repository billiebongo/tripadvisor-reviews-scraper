The food was delivered on time and it was hot.
Paneer Pakoda was delicious, Corn Cheese Kebab is done well and the Rasmalai was awesome....Guests had several helpings. Masala Chai was just right.
Party food was hit! Highly recommend...

Loved the makkai ki roti, saag buffet brunch. Very tasty.
The new decor (since the move) is quite interesting food.
In general, their food is quite honest, simple but very tasty.

Delicious food and excellent service. By default food is spicy, but was adjusted for kids, do they were happy to visit this place. I was surprised to find them next to my condo.

Great food, helpful service and warm ambience (the ambassador car is a very interesting addition that brings back nice memories). A must visit!

Went there with my family. Food did not disappoint me the paneer methi Malai works great with the kulcha and the papadi chaat did not disappoint me. Soup was a little spicy but never mind. Overall great experience. Also staff were very helpful and friendly. 5 Stars

Vatan se is a little home in a foreign land. With vibrant classic Bollywood posters and an even more soothing playlist, it sets the 'feel's and takes you back home! And to top all of it, the food is delicious, sumptuous and among the best in Singapore. Plus, it's a super warm and welcoming experience. And to all of them who've never tried Indian food before and if you happen to be in SG, Vatan se shall top your list. Can't wait to back to Singapore and dig in at Vatan se

A fabulous ambiance, sumptuous food, good service are requisites to a good restaurant. "Amby bar" @ Vatan Se, 368 Tanjong Katong road offers great times for the quintessential "born in 80's diner". Rest assured u will do 3 things here:1. Gaze at Cartoonist Mario Miranda's timeless pieces of art on their walls.2. Take a trip down the memory lane on your travelogues in an ambassador.3. Gorge on the fabulous Kebabs and Tandoor delicacies. Highly recommended!! and get on their guest list as they have "Free beer promos" every now and then

I went to this place with my friends and we didn get disappointed. We were greeted warmly and staff guided us through the menu . Food was delicious and without any colour and MSG. The value was excellent compared to prices at other places with very unique ambience and atmosphere
5
Was there for a bite, chai tea & chat were great so are most of their dishes, just like home cooked ones! Price is very reasonable too. Ambience with deco was funky & modern unlike old traditional indian eateries. Heard they are giving out free beers! Do check out their FB page! In Singlish, Vatan Se Ho Se

If you are in Singapore, don't miss out on this one! Excellent food, nice ambiance and friendly staff! Sizzlers and Tikkas were simply delicious! Altogether a most enjoyable dining experience! We have added this restaurant in our 'go-to' list!

Great indian food with cool decor to match, including fun Bombay cartoons and a vintage car as a table. Great addition to the area!

We went to this restaurant with a lot of expectations to eat tasty sizzlers but Sizzling restaurant was not so sizzling...!!The taste was very average and the quantity was quite small.However, the food quality and taste of the other dishes was quite good overall. The serving size is quite small as compared to the price they charge. I like the concept of they giving 10% discount if you lock up your mobile in a box during your meal
4
A small non descript place but offering perhaps one of the best food you can ever taste. Their paneer is not to be missed. every item we took was tasty. Just go there with good appetite, enjoy the tasty food, simple ambience and typical singaporean service

I went to Vatan Se with my Indian chef friend, Sarab Kapoor of ZeeTV fame, confident that I would be eating well. (She's near impossible to please – a fussy foodie who'd rather eat a $3 dosa in Little India than pick at mediocre food in a 6-star hotel.) I wasn't disappointed. Clearly, love and attention have been lavished on every detail of this humble yet charming little restaurant. The decor, though far from fancy, is cool and quirky. The front of a vintage car (I kid you not) protrudes from a wall at the entrance, and gorgeous patchwork upholstered chairs splash the interior with pops of colour. All five of the dishes we ordered were flawless, even by Sarab's unforgiving standards. As I am accustomed to eating South Indian food, the North Indian menu held some surprises for me. The smoky eggplant dish, Brinjal Bharta, was divine. The depth of flavour was incredible and the texture was dangerously easy to eat. Just 'scoop, swallow, lick lips, repeat'. I believe I wiped the copper pot clean with my Garlic Naan. The Baltic Paneer was outstanding, due to the fact, Sarab informed me, that the owner imports fresh paneer from India. It truly is in a league of its own – sumptuously soft, without that slight rubbery texture that you find in most other restaurants. I won't bore you with the details of the tissue-thin Roomali Roll or the tender, sweet Rasmalai. Suffice to say they were excellent. One point to highlight is the lovely all-natural disposable plates on which the food was served. Made from dried leaves and hand-stitched by village women with natural twine, they are truly beautiful, each one unique and beautiful in its own right. For a mid-priced meal with great ambience, good service and fantastic food, try this little gem of a restaurant. I loved it

We had the Corporate Deepavali lunch at your restaurant on 19th October 2017 and I must say that we made the right decision.As we entered the restaurant, we were welcomed with the wonderful aroma of the freshly cooked food. The spread of dishes was good and each dish had its own unique and distinctive flavour. The dishes had the warmth of home made food.All of us definitely had more than one helping. Along with the attentive service of the staff , it was a pleasant dining experience and I would definitely recommend “Vatan Se” for the excellent Indian cuisine.Evergreen Global Pte.Ltd.Singapor

We have very picky tastebuds for Indian food. Some restaurant uses too much tenderiser that makes their tandoori chicken or Malai chicken tikka to obtain that tenderness. Trust me too much tenderiser of the chicken unnaturally turns us away. But in vatan se, I love their Malai chicken tikka, the taste is heavenly marinated and the tenderness from the chicken is just right as they uses fresh fruits juice as their tenderiser that’s why every bite is well worth eating. My Husband love their samosa chaat and papri chaat. I have tasted those chaat and gave 2 thumbs up. Their mutton biryani is also very nice unlike some biryani that have smell of rosewater. Their garlic naan and tandoori roti is yummie too that we eat with the mutton curry. And they also have Indian ice cream which has the taste of cardamom that’s for a sweet treats. I definitely recommend for those who love authentic Indian food must try my favorite Malai chicken tikka or tandoori chicken don’t miss it if you visit Vatan Se. Those songs played in the restaurant are very nice. Awesome place wish to visit soon.Price is of mid to high.

I and two family members went for dinner on Sunday at 8 PM. We were immediately attended to. Papad & mint chutney was brought as starters Orders were immediately taken and food came quickly. We ordered Samosa chat, Roti, chapati, Punjabi Kadhi, Aloo Dhania, Jeera rice, Rasmalai & Paan. Food was tasty. Chapati was little doughy & thick. Interior was tasteful. Chairs and tables were comfortable. Food was served on sewn leaves plate. Walls were adorned with Maria cartoons. There was the bonnet of an old Indian icon, ambassador car with sights of Indian ambassador culture. Many couriers came to collect food for home delivery.

We went there at off peak time. The staff was polite and good. The decor is really interesting and different. Most of the food we ordered was really good.. we loved seekh kebab, peas pulao, malai kebeb, Balti chicken and lacha paratha. Rogan gosh wasnt upto the mark. Sizzler was good too.. finished it off with rasmalai and paan. The cutlery used is also very unique in singapore. It felt like going back india. Interesting place and would definitely recommend.

We catered from Vatan se for a working lunch and a corporate team gathering on a Yacht. Amazing service and food was provided. Guests thoroughly enjoyed the food and the yacht organized by Amit.

Vatan Se catered a party at my house in June. We ordered the tandoori oven and it was well worth it. Food was delicious and plentiful and service great.

Food - Way Below Average Service (within restaurant) - Very slowMusic - TerriblePrice - Not worth the qualityDecor/Posters on walls etc - The only saving grace

Hadn’t visited India in almost a year, but just stepping into Vatan Se teleported me to my home country! The attention to detail-from décor to music to aroma is really reminiscent of contemporary India. A fun, family vibe indeed! The food was definitely the high point though, because it didn’t have the ‘restaurant taste’ (colours/MSG etc.) We went in a group of 10, and everyone had their cravings satisfied (veg, non-veg, lassi, paan etc.)-which is super rare here in SG. Wonderful experienc

We visited them for dinner. Service was prompt and courteous. Food was extremely tasty. Portion of food were larger than expected. We had ordered Malai Chikkan tikka was very tender and juicy. Dal Makkhani and butter chicken was just the right taste. The kids loved the shikanji. The decor was very unique and interesting. Seating is casual. Will recommend this place as a must try.

It's just around the corner we are living...passed a few times and today we decided to have dinner here.The ambiance with the lightning and comic art drawing is very relaxing.Further the table top setting is unique with using Eco style friendly plates. Gives it a different note.We had a few dishes and they were good...palak paneer, aloo tikki, naan bread and some others

Vatan Se @ Tanjong Katong served us the most authentic North Indian food we have had in Singapore. Add to that, very homely atmosphere and service. The 'pattal plates', the temple bell at the entrance, the Ambassador car 'dining table', the Karahi lamps, the milk cannister stools......its such a beautiful feeling being there and reminds of back home
