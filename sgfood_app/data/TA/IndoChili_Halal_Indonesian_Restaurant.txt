the best Indonesian restaurant in town...lontong cap go meh is my favourite...the dessert are really good too..
5
I enjoy the food that IndoChili serve. It's amazing good with amazing service from the waiter. I appreciate the service given.
5
One of the best Indonesian cuisine food I have tasted. Every dish that we picked was very good. We went early therefore the restaurant was quiet
5
Nice place with the right indo taste. Will definitely come back and recommend this place to friends.
5
Nice food with super friendly and accommodating staffs. Highly recommended specially to those who wants to try some Indonesian cuisine for the first time.

My family had our Chinese New Year eve dinner at IndoChilli. We eat here once every few months as the food has a unique taste and we cannot detect MSG. This time round, the food was very tasty, as always, but also cold / room temperature upon serving, as always. What ticked me off this visit was no clear notice stating that service charge would be increased from 10% to 20% during Chinese New Year, and the restaurant playing the same lively Chinese New Year music track lasting about 4 minutes, on repeat. It probably takes no less than 45 minutes in general for food to arrive and people to eat. That meant hearing the same track no less than 11 times, and it almost drove me crazy.

Went in there with my Indonesian wife.No greetings from the staff, just got a tablet put in front of us without and explanations and still not a word from the Indian waiter!!!!So you place your order by the tablet and wait until one of the 3 waiters have time to bring you the drinks ( we were alone in the restaurant)Food showed up, i ordered Oxtail soup, that comes over open fire. When the nonspeaking waiter lit the flame to keep the soup warm, it was clear that there was not enough flammable tissue in the burner, but that was ignored which resulted in a cold soup after 5 min. But the oxtails were very well cooked and a tasty soup.My wife's chicken was very nice and spicy just like she prefer. A shame the complete lack of motivation and interest from the waiting staff ruined a nice but expensive meal
1
food was so so only.... and poor service staff throwing plate and show attitude. 3 of us almost to finish ....my friends when to toilet and I when to pay the bill, but I have not finish yet and they collect all the plates and left mine only I feel so awkward at that moment...... Please don't touch anything on the table especially water 330ml Aqua mineral water cost $1.50 per bottle
4
The food quality is good and almost all the dishes we tried were great. Dessert servings is quite big so good to share if you are already full from your main. Didn't give a high rating for atmosphere as there was a large table behind us that made it quite hard for us to have conversations with their noise. The acoustics of the place is not conducive if one encounters a big and rowdy group.
3
I asked for indoor seating and was given table right by the open entrance. They didn't switch on the AC and I felt like I was sitting outdoors. Shifted us to another table and moved us back again after realising that the alternate table was booked. Finally turned on the AC after we told them to. Wifi connection lapsed and made browsing on the restaurant tablet laggy
5
Info chili restaurant there food was super so good and delicious.Inak Sakali....bagus.friendly staff .
5
Food was great and the restaurant had great vibes. Responsive and courteous waitresses who are helpful.
4
Went with friends to try it as I passed by it several times. Ordering was done using iPad. Prices were reasonable and ambiance was nice. Only thing that could improve was that the food should be served piping hot.....
4
A nice restaurant, no frills, with very good food and friendly service. Prices are also very reasonable. Worth a visit
3
Indochili has ordinary food. There are no special dishes, the service is not good and the plate design is not artistic. The Nasi Goreng's rice tastes frozen and the peanuts were a mess.
4
Gado-gado and yellow rice are really good! The chicken satay is also nice. A must try. The staffs were super nice. We stayed long as it was my gathering with 2 friends who i havent met for long. They didnt disturb us although they almost closed. They waited... until we realized
1
Warm drinks and cold food, food looked nothing like the menu. We ordered the beautiful looking chicken leg on the menu and got two tiny chicken drumsticks that was served tepid. We paid nearly $16 for a prawn dish and got a total of 9 tiny prawns. The beef Rendang that was meant to have been cooked for 4 hours tasted like it had been cooked the day before and once again was served warm to the touch but meat was cold inside. to top it off the drinks were served warm from a bottle or can and no amount of ice could have chilled them down. Never again
5
We went to this restaurant because the adjacent Zion Hawker Centre was shut (luckily for us). From the traditional snack through to the traditional main course the food was excellent. While more expensive than a Hawker Centre the quality and quantity of food made the meat value for money. The number of locals eating there should be testament enough.
2
I went with a group of friends for lunch and among my group of 7 of us, we have 1 friend who is an Indonesian Chinese. We were quite dissappointed with the food and service rendered to us. The food was expensive and the portion is small which I can understand the small serving for most Indo restaurants, but the portion doesn't justify for the price that was charged. The restaurant waitress were not friendly at all and we had to ask for our stuffs a couple of times before it was served to us. A glass of "tap water" which they call it was charged at $0.50 PER CUP and its non refillable!! If you as for refill, they will jus bring you another new cup which you will be charged another $0.50!! We were shocked when we saw the bill!
1
The Nasi goreng was not good. The seafood in it was tasteless, probably frozen and was the worst one I have ever had. The food arrived really fast so perhaps it is just reheated. The rest of My Family said the food was ok but not great. Will not go bac
5
Decent foods, excellent service, nice ambience, and reasonable price. Would love to visit this place anytime I crave for Indonesian culinary.
5
Great food great team atmosphere was great. Value for money but some dish can be improved in portion size
4
Staff were friendly and warm, ambience was excellent, taste of food was good. Just that the food arrived very fast (within minutes!) But was not piping hot. It makes us wonder if the food had been pre-cooked. Price was reasonable. 6 of us dined for close to $100 sgd
2
We orders some of the most basic stuff. Fried rice the Indonesian way is a key item to get correct. The presentation was simple and nice, but it was oily, lack the kick, even basic spicy is not felt and the chicken that comes with it had really no authentic taste. Sup buntut was over priced and not very generous with the tail meat. Taste was just ok. Nasi tumpeng was also moderate. Very surprising considering all the advert hype. The spicy sambal given on the side was ok.
4
First time eating at IndoChili and we were not disappointed. It was a Wed. night and there was a full crowd. We ordered Ayam (Chicken) Sate Madura, which is char grilled over fire and the peanut sauce is already applied like the authentic Indo style. Also, the Beef Rendang was absolutely aromatic & delicious along with Tahu Goreng (Fried Tofu) and Nasi Kuning (Yellow Rice). Indochili has a super nice Indo atmosphere and the aroma from the kitchen adds an extra sensory experience. Like most places in Singapore, prices could be better but overall an excellent experience
1
We visited Indochili since it was first established at Zion Road and been a loyal patron over the past few years.Today we visited Indochili for lunch with my family. 2 male staffs were standing at the counter and no welcome greeting offered. This is something new and this is not the usual service standard.One of our order came late for over half an hour. No apologies, no explanation and the food was just left on our table and that's it. It shows a total lack of respect for customers. To top it off, we are being charged a service charge.In summary, the staffs are just not bothered to care about providing good service. Encountering such level of service, we doubt that we would ever want to come back again no matter how good the food is
3
I feel I need to go back a second time before having a more-informed opinion, but the first time was already a good start. I love Indonesian food and a new find is always welcome. But it is one of those brand of newish Singapore restaurants with impersonal service (you can only order from a tablet at your table), so one has to make allowances. The food arrived so soon after I ordered (normally a sign of good service), that I was alarmed they cook it in a central kitchen and just warm it at the restaurant. That said, one of the chicken dishes was quite good, while another was just so-so. Avoid the (sweet) yellow (glutinous) rice
5
My wife (Rita) and I enjoyed the very tasty Indonesian food served by INDOCHILI @ Zion Road like Sate Ayam Madura, Lontong Sayur Medan, Gado Gado Siram, Perkedel, Sop Buntut, Nasi Timbel, Sambal Petai Udang Padang, Cumi Bakar Jimbaran, Acar and Tempe Goreng and dessert (Es Teler and Es Cendol).Please call to make reservation for lunch and dinner.
4
This place is packed. For a Tuesday night, the indoor seats were full! Tablet ordering and payment can be sent straight to your mobile phone and connects to PayPal. Very savvy and convenient plus you don't have to worry about flagging down a service staff. However, the kitchen and drink station really didn't concern itself with the sequencing the food/drinks delivery. 2 drinks arrived followed by all our rice a few minutes later. 5 minutes or more went by before another drink was served and still no dishes. Just our rice getting cold. Then a dish arrived and all but one of our drinks was served. It was just very odd sequencing. By the way, if you order the chips/crackers, they won't be serving you a fresh plate of them. Just grab a bag from the basket left at your table
3
Went with family and friends on a weekday evening. The location is fairly central on Zion Road -- a bit difficult to park around there, but easy enough to go to Great World City across the way and walk over from there.Nice decor and a good choice of authentic Indonesian fare on the menu. Order from iPad at the table which I am not a great fan of.Tried some satay, beef rendang, bbq chicken dish and something similar to chicken rendang (sorry forget the name).Service friendly and efficient. All in all a pleasant enough evening out. It is just that there are so many places in Singapore selling this kind of food and they are all so tasty. There would really need to be some differentiating reason to mark Indochili up further
4
A place with good food for any event. Good choices of food, drinks and desserts. You'll be spoilt for choice. The satay is a must try. You'll be addicted.
5
Just had a sumptuous meal at IndoChili. The staff were very friendly. And the food was really good. Love the ambience too.
5
Good food good service and excellent ambience. Defiantly a restaurant worth dining at and delicious ice delimar.
5
Fantastic food especially....Tahu Telor is to die for!! Also recommending Ayam Goreng Cabe Hijau, Ayam Goreng Kremes. They serve authentic Indonesian food at reasonable prices. Even my picky son loved the food here!!
5
I recently had dinner here. It was really one of the best places I have been to in Singapore. The food is great in a wonderful entourage. And not to forget the great staff who are always willing to help you (being a foreigner and not too familiar with the food ;))Thanks for the lovely dinner and evening. Would definitely go back here when I am in Singapore again
4
We had our appreciation dinner at IndoChilli, Zion Road just recently. Kudos to all the crew in IndoChilli for their great hospitality and not forgetting the wonderful dinner. Dinner spreads from light delight Tahu Telor to the sumptuous Nasi Tumpeng Traditional. We salivated just by looking at Nasi Tumpeng and the taste was simply WOW! eh-hmm..the sambal terasi was a powerhouse. For a group dinner complete with a good dessert, great service and a wonderful ambience, we have enjoyed the beautiful dinner event. Indeed IndoChilli @ Zion Road deserves our second visit
4
Chanced upon this restaurant while reading reviews, seeking a good Indonesian restaurant for dinner with friends from Europe last week. We had a very tasty dinner in this family owned restaurant, at great value prices, and I would certainly recommend it for honest, authentic, no frills Indonesian food. The beef rendang, spicy aubergine, mutton curry and chicken satays were all very memorable, and I will certainly be returning to IndoChili in the near future
5
The most impressive about this place is the ambiance, very cozy and you will really want to stay and enjoy your food.The staff are all accommodating and cheerful, they all look like they are a family to each other, Cherry, Nelly, Vanisa and Asom are the people behind my great experience in IndoChili. Yudi should really take good care of them because they make the stay here more fun.If you get a chance to try Indonesian food, this is the place you MUST visit because it will be worth it. Easy access to parking lot and it is located beside the road so it is easy to find.I recommend this place to everyone.
1
We experienced the worst service in a Singaporean restaurant so far - staff not interested in customers.The restaurant is closing at 22:00 but most of the staff left at 21:30 and the rest of the staff didn't really care about us... e.g. Cleared our baby chair even if we were still eating (it was 21:30 and not 22:00).There was a Paypal promotion with free Kueh lapis - but we had to ask for it to receive itFood was good- but for a nice dining experience service is too bad!
4
The food is really good and authentic Indonesian. Service is excellent. The people are courteous and very gentle. This is a halal restaurant. I felt comfortable dining here and tried their chicken satay (Sate ayam madura), their seafood fried rice (Nasi goreng seafood), and a side of sambal (Sambal colek). Good, tasty, portions which are just the right amount. I am planning to work my way through the menu.The interior is charming. There are enough large tables for a sizeable family or for a business meal. Outside seating is available. Overall the place is on the smaller size but has a warm interior with lots of charm. Weekend reservations seem necessary as they are busy and popular. Overall, definitely a very nice place to have a meal with family and friends
5
We gathered with my Indonesian friends at Indochili for dinner. I cant say anything everything seems to be perfect. Food & Services was great. If you are looking for Authentic Indonesian food , this is it!!!! Thank you so much for good services.
5
Great foods great services !!! Looking forward to visit Singapore again.Thank you Indochilli and service staffs ( Venessa, Nelly, Cherry and Som). These are those friendly faces that welcome you to their humble restaurant
5
Enjoyed delicious Indonesian cuisine! Like their beef rendang and tahu telur! Good for family gatherings and lunch time outings.
4
Staff are friendly and accommodating. Ayam with green cabe is delicious. Ask for more green chili!!!
5
The sate ayam madura is amazingly tender. The rice sets are good value for money with a satisfying array of sides. Great service and nice ambiance too.
4
First time here with my girlfriend and have no regrets. Brings back fond memories of our time in Bali :) Free Kueh Lapis too for adding reviews on Trip Advisor.
5
I always eat here for lunch and their service never disappoints me. Excellent service from the staff, good food and ambience. Highly recommended!
4
IndoChili at Zion Road was pretty awesome! It was comfort food at its best. Skip the rice and carbs to avoid a food coma.The Sate Ayam Madura was savory, tender and full of flavor. Another favourite of ours is the Tahu Telor. The omelette was sweet yet savory at the same time, with crunchy peanut bits which provide a textural difference.The food was overall great. My only gripe was avoid sitting outside the restaurant. It is full plants with swarms of mosquitoes flying around. Best to stay indoors to avoid getting bitten
5
I ordered Gado Gado and Tahu Telur and I was instantly transported back to the summer vacation I took last year in Indonesia- Trust me, this is the real deal -- absolutely authentic, absolutely delicious! You will not be disappointed and the service was fantastic -- a waitress by the name of Hanily was so gracious and so accommodating! Highly recommend -- will again very soon
5
The Food was delightful and it was fulling to our stomachs. The presentation was appealing and the taste was similar to their Indonesian style! PS,the food and the taste and the restaurant wasss AWESOME!!!!This restaurant is beautiful and the food is very sumptious and the presentation is very impressiv
4
Been here with Indonesian friend for my farewell. The food is great. The service and setting are superb.
Highly recommended for a group lunch.
4
The food is delicious, just that the portion is small. In general, the ambient of the restaurant is good.
5
Especially liked the tahu telor, the fried beancurd with egg. Sate ayam (chicken skewers) were great, too!
5
Tahu Telor, sate Ayam & Ikan Kecap. We really like Indonesian food. They don't have MSG which is very healthy. Great service also. See you soon we will definitely come back.
4
Food are not served hot but nice customer service from 1 staff who is always smiley and attentive. Restaurant needs to think how to serve the food hot.
5
Food served hot. Very filling. We really enjoy the food here. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. Thumbs up!
5
Referring to my previous posted in August 2016, in which Indo Chilli has failed to deliver my order during our event. The owner personally contacted me to apologize about the incident and offer their food delivery FOC. Thank you for the Owner's sincerity, I decided to use Indo Chilli for another event. All guests were so pleased by the unique nasi tumpeng and said that the food was tasty! The Owner also followed up to ensure that all went well.Thank you IndoChilli for your effort to make things right
5
Small cosy place with great food! Was there with colleagues on Wednesday. Satay, ayam goreng, tahu telor, ikan bali, mutton curry, fried long beans, fried Kang Kong, sayur lodeh, ... all went superbly with the fragrant yellow rice. Not to mention the jus alpukat (avocado juice) and es chendol. Service was also great!
4
I have a group lunch at this restaurant on 14 Feb 2016. The serviced rendered by its Staff Vanisa is superb and excellent. Even after the lunch, when I had some issues with the billing for claiming, Vanisa went all out to assist me and even provided me with her personal mobile number to attend to my queries. Remarkably, she attended to me even after office hours. She also reported for work early to handle my issue. She is responsible, dedicated, courteous and helpful. The restaurant 's will definitely increased with such a committed worker around...thanks Vanisa for your good work 
4
Great ambiance. Tasty, just right amount of spiciness and value for money. We came for lunch on A Sunday and restaurant wasn't crowded. Service staff was friendly and accommodating to us and with our two toddlers. Will come back again to try out the other dishes.
5
Quite a delicacy to eat at this place.. they serve absolutely delicious food and not stingy in ingredients. I really plead people out there to try eating here and indulge in every taste of their food.
5
Great ambience, awesome food!!! Location is convenient even for public commuters. The food definitely had authentic taste. Thanks Hanily for the great service!!!
5
Nice food and EXCELLENT service!!!
Will definitely be returning and will recommend our friends!
Great ambience to have mini gathering. The service is wonderful and we feel welcoming.
Keep up the great service and great food!
4
First time here. Food was authentic and delicious! Tau Hu terlor is nice, sotong is chewy, chicken skewers is tender and tasty. Will definitely re-visit soon with friends.
5
Friendly staff, if you missed Indonesia food, this is good place for you. The prices are reasonable.
4
Delicious food. Never fail me each time I visit. The regular items that I always order Cumi Balado, Ayam Panggang Padang and Tempe Pete.
4
The food is good and prices are quite reasonable. Helpful and friendly staff. We all had a great dinner!
4
Order a traditional nasi tumpeng for my family celebration. It was complimentary that had been given from Indo Chili. The Nasi tumpeng was delicious with lots of side dishes. My family enjoyed it so much. Thanks a lot to mas Cahyadi (indochili manager) who helped me with this arrangement. Will always recommend IndoChili to my families and friends.
4
This place is tucked in the least noticeable location along Zion Road. When I first entered the restaurant, aromas of spices greeted me. I chose the set lunch which was seafood fried rice. That could well be the tastiest indo fried rice I ever tasted. The dessert is also to die for. Must try the chendol! Overall, I would rate this place 4/5 stars.
5
Ordered chicken bakso, lamb curry, and cendol. This is as authentic as it gets. It is average price, considering the location. I would recommend if you're looking for a nice sit-down establishment. The Zion Hawker stand is right around the corner to give a point of reference
5
Together 8 of us had lunch there. The serving portion is just nice. Services are good too. Will dine again
5
Very authentic Indonesian taste, my Favourite is the Taohu telur and lontong.
Despite the crowd , the service staff were patient and attentive . I'll definitely come back
5
It was great dining at IndoChili. Food was really good especially the Ikan Bali. Staff were friendly and warm too.
5
Had a good time eating here with family. We ordered a variety of dishes.The food are delicious and the staffs are friendly.
5
The food was really delicious. Good Indo food and reasonably priced! The eggplants, tahu telok and BBQ fish are highly recommended.
3
Food was okay.. Not fantastic.
They forgot our KangKung so we had to cancel the order.
Service was not so good either. They were not alert.
Latte is too sweet and too much milk. Can't even taste the coffee.
1
I seldom write a negative review to feedback, but my this first experience with them was really really bad that I feel I need to raise my experience so that others can make aware too. Seriously no bias, but truely honest. First started off with our request to change seats as we do not want to seated beside the toilet. I can see there were a lot of vacant place but all their concern was other bigger crowd of reservation. I know maybe was just 4 of us (spending less). Plus we also have reservation being made. But they were not really customer centric. They do not think why we have such a request. I mean, if they can maybe just started with "Let us try to see if we can do anything" rather that "Nope, we can't do that". I can see they were other 4 pax table available, aren't that those come first get to choose the table by ourself? This is follow by iPad ordering system. Which I dun find it impressive with such a small little restaurant. I mean by a staff ordering from customer, you can actually interacts with them, understanding them well and build up the relationship. But we felt cold between customer and the staff. Inexperienced staff worsen the whole dining experience. Started off with a totally clueless staff sending an ice lemon tea without lemon in the beverage (actually she mistaken ice lemon tea with citrus tea) which I find it is quite unbelievable. Then requested a sambal for cracker dipping which took ages to come. Overall the food was not bad. But they start clearing off my empty plate first (I finished earlier) while the other of my friends are still eating. I mean does it make a different for them to clear it now or later? They need to assess the overall table condition. It is rude to interrupt a table just to clear a person plates (as indirectly you are chasing off those slow ones). So I also very pissed off and if you wan to clear it by all means do it. From then I stopped continue my meal which in fact we still have quite a fair amount of food left (which maybe I might be able to continue, perhaps). I can really felt that communication breakdown was when we enquirer about the complimentary Kuey Lapis for PayPal payment. It took them long explanation to clearly clarify what we need to do (involved a few staff) and as expected, free stuff doesn't come easy (we waited 30 minutes for the Kuey to be served at our table). Seriously I would think they did it on purpose as I dun think serving this requires that long time. In addition, we requested for still water together with the Kuey Lapis also never reached our table as anticipated. One word to describe all of the above: service "FAILED", only credit can give to is the chef preparing the food. I really dun think I will go back to that restaurant. 还钱还要受气 (probably they also dun care my review). But to the others, please do not expect to high from their service and you all will be just fine
4
Some friends took us here knowing we had lived in Indonesia for 10 years and missed the food. We were not disappointed. We had Ikan Kakap Bakar, Gado Gado, Sayur Kangkung, Rendang, and Sotong Bakar. All was great, especially the Sotong. The Gado Gado tasted good but had a little too much lotong in it. Still good flavor. Seating was pretty good, a little cramped. Easy to get to by bus or taxi
1
i had the nasi goreng set, it came almost half an hour into me waiting and only after i checked with the nervous waiter. sate was skinny and cold on dodgy tasting peanut sauce. fried rice was sticky like pudding and was more sweet than spicy. i asked for chilli (as in the spice) but was given a sambal instead. the urap was sad and soggy, maybe the chicken bumbu was the only thing i didnt have a problem with but that came way later than the fried rice (it was sposed to come with the set
4
I am a regular at this restaurant as it is very near my home. I love the Soto Ayam, Beef Rendang and the Telur Goreng. They also have some great drinks as well and often drop by in the afternoons for a drip coffee and piece of Kueh Lapis.Highly recommende
5
We came in a group of 12 and can't find seats initially. Luckily IndoChili managed to squeeze us in. It was all worth it!
5
Enjoyed the food very much. Love the sambal kangkong. The chicken curry is also very good.
Need to make reservation especially if group is large. Can be very crowded.
5
Nice food with good service. Very convenient.. Nice music to go with. The assam, curry chicken, tahu telur. Are nice.
5
Good food - like the fried fish, kangkong, tauhu telor, curry chicken. Great company! Will come back again.
5
Excellent place for lunch gathering.
Delicious food and good ambience.
Have been here for a few times and the quality is consistently good.
5
The food is excellent! The service is also very fast! Good service too! Very Good. Excellent! Food is great!!!!!!!!!!
5
Good food and convenient venue for lunch. Suitable for office crowd. Advisable to make a reservation before coming.
5
Chicken Satay with good taste, good ambience and fast service. Can be recommended to friends and co-workers.
5
Excellent food and service.
Beef satay very tasty and delicious. Service is excellent and very corteous.
4
So tasty and full of flavour and on top of that, reasonably priced! Food was served quickly and staff were very friendly and welcoming. No alcohol (from what we could work out) but iced tea was refreshing! If there had been drinks available we probably would have stayed to try the whole menu!
5
Fantastic Sate, delicious rawon, great tahu telor, amazing ayam kalasan, super sayur asam.... we will be the fanatic customers of Indochilli!
4
Authentic. Sate ayam is to die for! Love the soup selection too! Rawon and sayur asem are really good. Ayam kalasan is great. Great design too.
5
Yummy Indonesian food with nice service staffs! We always come here to celebrate our helper's birthday.
5
Beef satay was excellent! Sotong belado was very fresh and their sambal was amazing. Highly recommended and I suggest trying the wide variety of authentic Indonesian foods. The chicken penyet was extremely soft that it could just slide off. Cendol was savoury
5
One of the best Indonesian cuisine in Singapore. Reasonable price, excellent service. Highly recommended is the lontong medan. Yumm
4
the nasi goreng is great. However, the rawon soup (traditional black soup) is a lil bit strong.
ambience is very nice. Need to put reservation during Friday/ Saturday night.
5
we have a good time here eating the good and authentic Indonesian food
Have been frequenting this place since it was opened, food standard is consistent, and the staff are friendly!
4
Food is reasonably price and they serve pretty sumptuous food. Service here is not bad but still have room for improvements. Worth a visit
4
Came for a company lunch. We enjoyed the services and the quality of the food. Ordered many different dishes and they all tasted good. Not very spicy overall.
4
If you're a fan of Indonesian food, you won't be disappointed. If you're new to Indonesian food, this is a great place to be introduced to the cuisine. I went with a group of 10 and had a chance to sample over a dozen dishes, and each was delicious!Note: this establishment does not serve alcohol. They also do not have a Rijsttafel on the menu.
5
The food have always been really good coupled with the friendly team of staff namely Doreen, Mayoun, Linda, Cherry, Lyana and Yudi ... It definitely made my trip to IndoChili worth every cent :)
4
The food is quite authentic and the level of spiciness is just nice for our whole family. Staff is friendly and prompt. However, our only complaint would be the almost non-existing aircon! It got really warm after half an hour into dinner.
5
Great Indonesian food. We go there very regular and loved the food. Pricing is very reasonable. You need to go there.
5
Fantastic and authentic food and impeccable service from Doreen and Nicole. Very helpful and attentive.
5
The food is really good. Love the atmosphere. And the service was great too. Very friendly waitress.
1
I order nasi tumpeng for my birthday celebration on Nov 4, 2016. However, what I got only humiliation, because the nasi tumpeng never showed up.Here are the chronology :1. I order nasi tumpeng via online and got the confirmation email. 2 At Nov 4th, I call around 11.30 and they said the nasi tumbeng have been delivered and will arrived shortly. I even ask the total of the payment to make sure.3. At 12.30 still not arrive and I tried to called. They said they will call the delivery guy.4. And of course, I'm the one who's calling back, and they said there's no reservation for nasi tumpeng (what a great excuse after the first called, they said it's being delivered)5. The lady ask for the confirmation letter, I sent her through wa, the she called me back, said that it's nobody fault. Because the computer reply it by default (so it's mean nobody check it right?) and it's not her responsibility.Is this how Indochili treat their customer? With no responsibility at all
5
We dine at newly open IndoChili branch at Tanjong Pagar Centre. We try few signature dishes, the taste is good. Price is reasonable, main course at $11.80. The staff there is friendly & nice as well, one of them name Doreen is very friendly. Haha~ Highly recommended!!!
3
Nine of us went for a group lunch on a Tuesday. We were quickly settled down at our reserved table. Orders were taken by tablets available at the table. Genuine quality cuisine. Service was prompt and efficient. The waitress was attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that the portions were small despite ordering two of each item
5
It is a cosy restaurant with friendly staffs. It was my first to this restaurant. The service provided is really good. I would like take this opportunity to thank all the staffs especially Doreen and Nicole for making the celebration much joyful. Thumb up for the foods too.
5
Excellent service from Doreen, Cherry, Nicole, Vanisa, Yudi and Lida!!! Despite catering to a large crowd at the restaurant, the servers were able to serve the food with much efficiency to our middle eastern guests. We had a table of 20, but staff was quick, courteous and polite, amazing. The food, as always, was great. Our guests were bowled over here!!! Would definitely come back the next time to host another event.
5
Food was great. Service was super when the waiters get to you. Very personal, warm and friendly. 10/10! Doreen was the best!
4
We were entertained here for an official program. Small yet cozy place. We didn't get to choose the dishes as it was already picked by the host. Nevertheless, they were pretty good. Tasty and beautifully presented.
4
good food, quiet enough for gatherings. one of the better indo food I've tried. my Indonesia friend said this is one of the more authentic Indonesian food in sg. love the tahu telor.
5
First time dine in here.we had fish ikan goreng kremes, Beef randang,Avocado shake and chandol.All the food are delicious and yummy.we are satisfied with the service from the team of Doreen,Nicole and Vanesa.Keep it up guyss!
Highly recommendation...

I was amazed. My mom's birthday could not have been better without IndoChilli. I went there with 10 pax. The food is fantastic! It is halal, the ambiance was perfect and it was delicious! Yudi, Vanisa, Doreen, Nicole and Yayat, for the incredible hospitality. I will definitely come again
5
We had Nasi Tumpeng Deluxe and ala carte for 23 pax. Reasonable pricing. Nice Cosy ambience and good food. Fast efficient service too. Friendly cheerful attentive team of servers...Tean, Doreen, Yudi, Nicole and Vanise. Great job! Please accept AMEX card. We had a great evening indeed. Thank you. We will come back for more :

Whilst not the best Indonesian food in town, the service was certainly top notch. We had a dinner for 7, and the casual Indonesian setting made it comfortable for interaction.The avocado choco was good, along with the Tauhu Telur and Ayam Bungu to name a few.Special shoutout to the staff, namely, Doreen, Nicole and Wansa. Their friendliness and smiles were infectious, and it was as if we were amongst family
5
It was our first time to try this place, which is just across Great World City. We had ikan goreng kremes, beef rendang, yellow rice, avocado juice and chendol! The rendang - tender and flavorful - was one of the best I've tried in Singapore! I would also like to commend Doreen and Vanessa for the exceptional service
5
Food is great. Indochili serves one of the more authentic Indonesia food in Singapore (including traditional tumpeng). The ikan bali rasa, rendang and satay were good but I would single out the yellow rice; it was exceptionally fragrant. Overall, we had a great time here; Indochili has great ambience and service. Special thanks to Doreen for her friendly and joyful service
5
Doreen is a great staff! So friendly. And the food is great. Very fragrant and yummy. Honey citron tea and tuhu telur are must haves!
5
Doreen's service is really great. I like this kind woman, 5 stars waitress! Beef is my favorite food here. You cannot miss it.
5
Great n tasty Indonesian cuisine which makes u feel like you're in Indonesian itself. Great service crew friendly and efficient in carrying out their service. Special compliments to Aunty Doreen who gave a five star service to us. Really enjoyed our 7th anniversary lunch there.
5
First time to IndoChili with some friend from overseas! The food is just absolutely delicious! We live every dish. Great service staff in Doreen and team!
4
If Halal food is a new experience for you, this is a GREAT place to go. Opposite the Great World City mall, this has a good menu, reasonably priced combined with great service. We had lunch and it was busy...so a reservation is recommended to avoid disappointment. This was a very enjoyable experience and I have already returned for a second taste! Please remember...if you are as unfamiliar as I was..Halal means no pork and no alcohol....the lemongrass Tea without sugar is really refreshing
5
Have been to a few Indonesian restaurants in Singapore but none come close to Indochilli.. Must eat Rendang, Tempeh and Tahu Goreng.. actually can eat anything and everything on the menu and you wont regret!.. Cleanliness and Ambience is great and perfect for couples and family... Payment cannot get any better as you can pay at table! All in all my restaurant when i have Indonesian food cravings
5
Food was delicious & tasty (e.g, the Combo Bakaran recommended by Doreen, a combi of prawn, sotong, fish & chicken, absolutely mouthwatering). Service was great, esp from Doreen, who was friendly & jovial. Kudos to Doreen & team for making our lunch visit such a pleasant one.Keep it up
4
We had an office luncheon at indochili today. There were 20 of us. It was our 1st visit. We were not too familiar with the food/how to order. Doreen was very helpful. She gave guide us through the menu & gave a few recommendation.We had our 1st meal about 15-20mins after we have confirmed our order. It was faster than expected.The place was quite cozy to accommodate the 20 of us
5
I have written reviews for this place so many times and you would think that I have run out of things to say but frankly, I have more to say each time! Nonetheless, I will be mentioning names of the amazing aunties that served me the most delicious Indonesian food from last night. Aunties Doreen and Nicole are so filled with love and enthusiasm for their job at the beautifully spiced place which makes customers very comfortable with the environment. Picture yourself laid back on my seat, enjoying FREE internet access while munching on delicious food or having a nice chat with the aunties or even chatting with your family, endless possibilities. The service here is one of the reasons to why I come here all the time (every Saturday night). I feel just at home!!!! You guys!! Please go over there and try the delicious food accompanied by amazing service!! Thank you auntie Doreen and auntie Nicole! If you guys stop by there, say hi and their flashing smiles will make your day!!

Having lived in London all my life and accustomed to the poor quality of Indonesian restaurants in town, I was a little dubious when I stumbled across this spot. I was so glad I did though! The food was great, I had the soto which was akin to my mother's and the ambience was very pleasant with Indonesian music being played in the background. Service was friendly and efficient. I'll definitely be a regular visitor
5
Here for lunch. Servers Doreen and Nicole were very attentive. Food was very good in general, fav Indonesian resto
5
Great services by Nicole, Linda, Doreen and Cherry! Food are also tasty and fresh! We really enjoyed the ambience and hope to come back real soon!
5
Excellent food and service. Super friendly staff Mrs Koh & Ms Nicole. They made a lot of different in our dinning experience. Well done ladies. Confirm will go again. Thanks again.
5
An excellent and frendly service... sweet smile approach from the staff.Name:Mrs Dore and Ms Nicole
Food is Delicious n Perfect!
5
Wonderful restaurant for any occasion, Doreen was exceptional in her service! The other service team was great as well! Definitely one of the best locations for a quick Nasi fix!
5
My colleagues and I came here for our team bonding Very sumptous indonesia food and great attentive service.
5
Doreen was very good with service. Great Rendang; fabulous tahu talo; ayang pangang! Will be back!
Thank you.
5
Had our dept lunch at Indochilli and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We kept making changes to our orders but the staff show no sign of frustration and were very understanding. A BIG thank you to Doreen and team for providing such a wonderful service! Most importantly, food is fantastic as well
1
Terrible unreliable service! Ordered nasi tumpeng delivery for baby's full month celebration and confirmed.- 1/2 hr late - first call we were told the driver has sent it- 1 hr late - driver was reaching- 1.5 hr late - said driver has left for long time and then want to check with kitchen staff- finally told us that they had miscommunication, food are in progress and only could deliver at 3pm!Service staff were rude and highly unprofessional. Didn't bother to check and to provide us with solution timely. Plus the apology was totally unsincere! All our guests were present and IndoChilli has clearly RUINED our celebration
1
Was looking forward to an awesome day in celebration of my brother's baby shower and food was catered from indochilli. Food was scheduled to be delivered at noon, but by 1.30 was still a no show. They actually messed up the orders and omitted ours.Thank you for making this memorable day even more memorable indochilli!!
5
Good food and service by Ms doreen.
Will come back again . I was recommended by my friend who told me about this restaurant. Worth paying
5
Food is nice and tasty and food preparation timing is just right. Definitely will come back. Nice enviornment too.
5
The food here is so niceeeeee! And the service is very good! Doreen; the staff here, she will take care of you so good! With reasonable price !
5
good food and excellent service . Good was serve fast and hot.
Doreen was great . she was helpful
- Ayam hijau was good

5
The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. Our server, Doreen, was attentive and friendly and even chatted with us about Pokemon Go! Recommended.
4
Actually the first time i had indonesian sate that taste really indonesian. Very very tasty, savoury, and just originally indonesian :). The ayam bumbu rujak also quite satisfying just a bit cold (next time , heat a bit longer) , a very good service, friendly staff and good atmosphere!!!Gave 4 as i tasted nothing on my nasi kampung (not salty, no taste, nothing
5
After so many visits to Indochili, I have noticed that the service remains consistently great! Doreen herself, and her team always have everything prepared for us. Even before we asked. And I will say, this is, genuinely service from the heart! Superb! My dad loves the Sop Buntut and Rawon. He keeps ordering the same dish everytime we went there. The taste of the food is consistently great, as well.. From the our first visit there, until this very moment.As for the special, I recommend to have their Avocado Juice and Rawon! The best Avocado ever! Prepared by Nicole! You must always have their Avocado Juice! The Best! The team is putting effort to make sure you have a pleasant dinner.. So, it's always recommended to visit Indochili for Best Indonesian Food and Service from the heart
5
Despite what you like to eat, Asian or Western cuisine, you have to try Indo Chilli- an Indonesian cuisine with foods that transport you to the local Indonesian culture. The spices are nice and flavorful; not to strong nor to light, you have a variation of spicy and non-spicy food depending on yours tastebuds and to die for desserts and drinks- completely different to what you would find in any other restaurant. The service attitude make you feel at home, comfortable and relaxed with no tension. The aunties there are so cheerful, happy and welcoming, treating you just like family as well as feeding you the best. You have got to try this place, you will not regret it!! Thanks for reading
4
Me and my wife visisted on Aug 8th and selected several dishes to share.From the time we were shown a table until leaving the service was very kind and relaxed. After ordering the food was delivered on record time. Great as were very hungry. The food tasted fantastic and the waitresses were very observant and attending. One thing to note is that there is no alcoholic bewerages served like a beer or similar. Absolutely no problem for me but good to know if you havent been here and expect something else.We will return for sure
4
I ate here two times; once for dinner and again for lunch another day. Food was authentic, I ate with an Indonesian friend who was in Singapore for several days who finally found a chili hot and spicy enough for her liking. Doreen and Linda were great waitresses, and I would recommend the restaurant again. Both times I went there it was popular
5
Our go-to place whenever craving for hometown food arise. :)
Love their nasi goreng sate, sayur asem, rendang, nasi timbel, tumpeng mini, and jus alpukat.
Pleasant service today by Doreen and Linda!
5
We went for Monday lunch. Easy to find and don't need to wait. The food is nice! I'll recommend Sop Buntut, Nasi Goreng seafood. And we like the menu design and the interior decoration. I think I'm pleasant to come again.
5
U guys must try this! It has a good taste which is really indonesia food. ❤️ i love the nasi timbel 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
5
Hosted a party at Indochilli on 26 July 2016. Excellent food and ambience with very friendly and helpful staffs. Thank you Doreen and Nico for the awesome service!
5
Great customer service! Yummy and delicious ayam with great smelling sense! Definitely coming back again!
5
Business dinner. It was a very pleasant meal. good food and good service. The Combo Bakaran was really tasty, especially the pawns. Doreen and Nico serviced us. Really good service! Will definitely come again next time. :)
4
Came here during Hari Raya with my family and helpers to celebrate. Overall very good ambience and decent food . Table and chairs big and wide. Very comfortable. Will come back again in future. Stone's throw away from Great World City. Good overall!
5
The food at Indochili are just on point to me and my family's liking. The highly raved Combo Bakaran, a combination of grilled black pomfret, squids, prawns, satay and chicken is definitely 'Satisfaction Guaranteed'. I also would recommend Kacang Panjang Balado and Tahu Telor, they are exquisite! Did I mention how efficient their service was?? We only had to wait for 10 minutes and our first dish was out. Thumbs up for that! Doreen, one of the waitress, kindly advised us on getting different types of rice (nasi goreng seafood or nasi kuning), if not getting only one type for five people would be too much. Glad that we heed her advice!I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Indonesian food and pleasant ambience. I know I'll certainly be returning soon
4
It was our first visit as it is conveniently located opposite our apartment. Very efficient and friendly service by Doreen and explained the dishes clearly. We ordered the ikan kecap, kambing gravy, begedil, sambal goreng and ayam kari and I wish I had a bigger stomach for them. The food was simply great! I don't recommend the desserts if you not a fan of jackfruit as they placed diced bits as toppings. The price was reasonable with the right food portions. Hope they maintain the standards for a long time as we plan to return!
4
1) Food was great2) The workers were friendly3) Service was great - but food were abit slow, be prepared to wait if you go here4) Price of food , slightly high but reasonableOverall, I would recommend for an office get-together or those craving for food out of this world. It has a different taste from the everyday food.And most importantly, arrive slightly earlier to order food first, as the waiting time might be 15-20min
5
Lunch is extremely satisfying. Wonderful hot lemon grass tea. Delicious buntut goreng. Fried oxtail and many others
4
Food was priced reasonably and tasted pretty well.
Must order the eggplant.
Service of staff was excellent.
Quite authentic and definitely worth a visit.
Better to reserve in advance as tables were all occupied.
1
Only received an SMS message to say that my booking which was initially at 7.00pm, pushed to 8.30pm. Did not have the decency to call my directly to inform me when all the plans have been made to dine there.
5
Came here a few times, and the food never disappoints! I love the Avocado shake in particular! Yums! I find the rest of the dishes very authentic-tasting as well, but then again, I'm not a true blue Indonesian so I may not be the best gauge of authenticity. Taste-wise, it is SEDAP....! *thumbs u
5
The menu is varied enough for us to come back again. The food was tasty and portioned well. The 3 of us shared the platter of grilled items and a side dish of vegetables. The service was prompt and friendly. The Sambal Terasi is a winner too
4
My second time eating here and food was even better than I remembered. We had satay, green beans in chilli and beef redang. The redang was absolutely delicious. Will definitely go back for more. Service was average but attentive. Friendly and casual atmosphere. Highly recommend if you're in the area
5
Reasonably priced authentic Indonesian food. Portions were adequate and the variety of tastes was interesting. The lime juice was great to drink with the pleasant chillies and the lack of alcohol was not an issue. The basket of snacks on each table was a good way to advertise snack food. Deserts were huge but a nice way to finish off. Dishes you would consider entrees came with the main dishes but that is how Asian food is often served
2
We were rushed to make an order due to a 'big' group awaiting to take theirs. We asked for a bit more time and within 2 minutes the waitress came back standing at our table which was a bit uncomfortable.Main meal came out about 15 mins after order (before the starters - actually 10mins after we finished the main!!) with the chicken dish severed cold, when we asked for it to be taken back and re-heated we were told that is how it is served! Portion size of the beef rang dang is for kids, my wife got half way through the rice with no meat (only 3 medium size cubes) or sauce left. On top of all that the bill came to 42sgd which is hugely overpriced for the quality of food. In summary average food at best with terrible service - AVOID!!
2
The first thing to know is that this is a "halal" restaurant, so if you're looking for a cold beer with your hot chillies, forget it. Inside was packed so we ate outside. It was a bit haphazard and grubby and the staff managed to get a lot of things wrong. One of our kids is a bit fussy so we asked that their satay skewers be served without the sauce. After repeating this a few times I was given traditional "can, can", but not surprisingly she "didn't, didn't" care, as everything came out smothered in it. When I pointed out the mistake I got the obvious "ohhh, sorry-ah!" With no attempt to correct it. I had to force the issue. If the satay had of been good, maybe I wouldn't have minded...but it was ordinary...even "not very good". The rest of the food was rushed and uninspired, and overall we wished we'd continued further down to the food market as originally intended. I'm afraid it's not on our "return" list.
3
good position across from Great World City(where you should park), this little place served up some very reasonably priced authentic Indonesian food. Highlights were the Ayam Bumbu Rujak (spicy chicken) and Sambal Mangga (mango salad). Note that this is a halal restaurant, so NO alcohol is served. Service was a bit hit and miss - while food came out quickly, instructions weren't followed and simple things like water request needed to be followed up. Strongly suggest booking ahead and inside as the place was full by 6.30pm on a Sat night and outside tables are close to Zion Rd. Value was excellent at $15pp
4
It's a great neighborhood stop if you are craving Indonesian food. Redang is delicious and get a cream soda. They also sell their own line of pastries.
5
My family and I have been eating at Indochili for over a year and Doreen, Nicole and Ma Youn know us well and have always been very nice. We are always joking around and having a good time with the staff. We have also invited several of our friends who were visiting from overseas and they really enjoyed the food as well. They have authentic tasting Indonesian flavours in a very comfortable environment and excellent service. It is definitely a restaurant we would recommend to our friends.
3
Food was overall good, chicken satay was better than the beef satay, beef rendang could have been more tender, tauhu telor was yummy and the prawn petai was amazing. A little upset that a screw up between Chope and the restaurant meant that they didn't receive my reservation for 15 pax but luckily we went for a very early dinner and seating was available. Food was pricey considering the portions served were pretty small.
4
Been there already twice, and I've never been disappointed. The food is authentic and very tasty. I recommend the grill platter, with some fish, prawns, calamaris and chicken, it's healthy and very tasty... They have various food from all around indonesia, and all of it is good.The service is also good, with friendly staff...and the pricing is more than correct!!!!Only point...as it's Halal, no Bintang !!!! but you can always go somewhere in town to get a cold one !If you're craving for Indo food after your trip in Bali, you should go here ! great restauran
5
For those who love nice indonesian cuisine, a place to go. I love their rendang and ayam panggang kecap! Oh, and don't forget to order Tahu telur that been served in small cut pieces of Tahu with a nice sauce - a little spicy though. My second visit actually, and they have nice selection of drinks and desserts.
4
Very good Indonesian foodfare across from Great World City. Atmosphere is relaxed and service was quick. Menu options include the standard Indonesian options - nasi goreng, nasi lemak, satay ayan/sapi. Prices were lower mid-range, affordable though. The layout is ideal for working lunches/dinners, couples and small groups. Less so for families with small kids (not good for those under 3 or with strollers) - kids 5 and older should be fine
4
It is not strange to find an Indonesian restaurant in Singapore , but I found this restaurant a very good one The food is reasonably good , the prices are very good and the service is good I recommend it to any one likes Asian food
4
We went with another family to Indochili this weekend. Have been there 5 times before probably. Food is consistently good. Service is friendly and good. There is street parking and parking lot. Not many spaces so maybe park at great world city. Weekends you need to book ahead probably to eat inside. Can't miss with this one
5
We had a great time with my wife in your restaurant last night , the food was great, so delicious and served fast. All ladies staff also is very friendly and patients in serving a big groups in other table, definitely I will recommend your restaurant to all my friends and family as well because it's MSG free and Halal certified.Thank you and job well done to all the ladies staff specially the one who served us
3
Food were ok, as expected of an Indonesian nasi padang restaurant. Service was prompt & polite. Setback was the slightly higher pricing (for the amount of food). Also was surprised to be informed that the sambal belachan (condiment) was supposed to be chargeable, but they very nicely gave us 2 saucers (for 8 of us) on-the-house, & if we wanted more, then they will charge us $1.80 for each saucer
4
Service was fairly good. We love the food but the space is constraint.
It is close to the mall and over-looking the roads. Not recommended for parking.
5
Fast service and quality food. Friendly staff. Second visit to the restaurant. Need to have more available parking places.
4
All the food was excellent and flavourful- aside from the prawns but the restaurant offered not to charge and gave us a discount too. Service was great. My third visit and I will be back!
3
The food was generally good. Portions were good-sized for most dishes. The Tahur Telur did not live up to expectations.
2
Went to this restaurant after seeing good reviews, but found waitress very rude, she even got angry for asking about some dishes. Small portions, average food.
3
Have eaten here a few times. Some very good dishes (the beef rending, the spicy fried pomfret) and some more so so (the chicken dishes). But all good and reasonably priced, Nice ambience though, as some reviewers have said, if there is a big party the place can be too noisy. Service OK - though tendency for dishes to come when they are ready (main courses before starters on occasion). Good selection of non alcoholic drinks (particular recommendation for the iced lemongrass tea). Would definitely return
3
The name ending with Chili can't represent the word itself. If you the type must eat spicy food then the dishes here wasn't really spicy nor hot. EG; Nando's MILD chili sauce for the peri-peri chicken. But, if you only a mild chili eater then you may try. I like Indon food in Bali & compare with Indochili, they is still a lot of rooms for improvement
1
Food is excellent but sadly the service is bad. The waitress did not give menu upon siting down & are busy talking.
3
I love indonesian food and have tried several restaurants in singapore before, sad to say this place cannot beat other places like tambuah mas. Service was also not very attentive and some of the staffs seemed abit annoyed when we had questions.
2
Went there for a quick meal and service was sloppy and waitress was grumpy. I would have walk out if not due to the fact that I was quite hungry. The Fried Rice that I've order is over-rated and priced. Nothing special. The 1st and last going there.
4
We ate there with the family. Service was good and fast. Their food was tasty.the price was reasonable for Singapore.
2
The service crew is not very alert nor friendly. Drinks were not serve till asked. Food portion was small.
4
Looking for good Indonesian food? Indochili defo the place to go to! The sateh is truly delicious. But a true must have is the rendang. Very tender and taste full an very nice seasoned. ((from the BBQ)
4
Love the ambience. Relatively authentic Indonesian food. The rendang was right on. Rawon, sayur asem, udang pete, ikan bumbu bali were average. Worth trying!
4
Great value for the money. A tranquil ambient to spend time with friends and loved ones. A must try.
4
Lovely food and atmosphere. Great prices. Loved the juices and ginger tea. Chicken satay and stir fried vegetables are a must!
4
I visited this place with colleagues. The ambience was comfortable and more spacious than most. However one table was extremely noisy and we could hardly hear each other. The crew was also less attentive and tends to forget orders. The food were quite good. The beef rendang was very nice and spicy. Satay was so-so. Platter combo was nice and served hot. Sop buntut was also rich in taste and served hot. Desserts we're prepared fresh. Serving size for all items were small so if sharing, might need to buy 2 of each kind. Overall I will probably be back.
4
Indochili serves a good range of Indonesian cuisine. It is a great place for chili lovers, as the name suggests, but they have great choices for those who don't like their tongues seared by spices too. The chicken thigh, bakar style, is excellent, and I love the tauhu telor (fried tofu with egg) too.
4
Very Good Indo Food, Service is Great. One should try the Ice-Blended Durian Coffee, I sure love it. Will go again one of these days... maybe the only thing of not getting 5 stars is the lighting, some parts of the venue is kinda too dark for comfort
5
If you are visiting Singapore, you really can't miss this little gem of a restaurant. The staff were helpful and the food was quick to arrive.I ordered a starter and a main meal. The starter was huge but absolutely delicious. I started to worry if I could manage my main course - Nasi Goreng. However, when it arrived, there was no way I was not going to finish it, it was stunning.My bill came to $22 SGD for a starter, main meal and a soft drink (about Â£11-12). Go there, you won't regret it
5
The beef rendeng was our favourite - very authentic. A great place! The staff are very friendly. Definitely go if you are in the area!
4
The food were nice & my tummy is full after eating. Turn me sleepy with a cosy place. Come visits here.
From us bungasutra.
4
I've been here two times and I enjoyed both experiences. Service was excellent and the food was good. We had classic Indonesian dishes such as ayam panggang and beef rendang, which were tender and flavourful. Value for money!
4
Followed my Indonesian friend to come here and had a great dinner with a variety of Indo food. Highly recommend people to pay a visit since the food is decent and the price is not that bad, coming along with a good service.
5
Came here for Indonesian food and was really impressive by it. Especially their Tahu Telor and Es Kopi Duren are really good.

Must reserve table as it is full house. Crackers are ok. Sambal chilli is killer spicy. Grilled fish is but over cooked. Grilled squid is too soft. Curry chicken, sambal brinjal are very good. Best is beef rendang. 5 people and each came up to SGD25 per pax,highly reasonable
5
I’ve recently returned to Singapore after my 3 years away, and ...many things have changed (for the better), and this includes finding new restaurants around my residence. One of the restaurants that caught my attention most is IndoChili. Aside from the fact that they serve something familiar (I’m from Indonesia), the restaurant’s interior and ambiance succeeded into luring me in. I finally decided to give them a try last night, after convincing 2 of my friends to come with. We were immediately greeted by one of the waitresses and led to our table. I must say, the use of wooden materials for their interior was a good idea, as we felt warm and cosy. My friends and I are all on the carnivorous side when it comes to eating, and we felt super relieved when we saw the menu. They’ve got so many variations of meat (chicken/beef) dishes! We spent a good 10minutes flipping through the menu and discussed on which meat dishes to order. They all look so drool worthy! But life, with its limits to choices one can make, must go on. We decided on their Sate Ayam Madura, Ayam Panggang Padang, Ayam Kari Padang, and Ayam Bumbu Rujak , Rawon Komplit, Cah Kangkung, and hot tea for drinks. As you can see, the dishes we ordered were 90% meat. Another kudos to IndoChili for serving their food within 7minutes from placing our order.After all our orders came out, we started with devouring the satay first. It had me at my first bite. The meat was so tender, and not overly charred. Paired with the flavourful gravy, it made a perfect starter dish. We then proceeded to the 3 variations of chicken dishes. Similar to the satay dish, the meat were all super tender and juicy. The accompanying sauces are all interesting, but my personal favourite is the Bumbu Rujak sauce. The spices were all blended perfectly. It’s also not too sweet/salty/spicy. It tasted just right on my palate, and it’s also the most memorable one. The soup for Rawon Komplit was also uniquely tasty! It tastes slightly different from the usual Rawon dishes I get in Indonesia, in a good way of course. An hour+, and 5 dishes later.. we finally felt the pressure from these foods in our tummies. And we concluded that IndoChili should be counted as Indonesia's sovereign territory - the Indonesian cuisine served here are as authentic as the ones in Indonesia! We would definitely come back again for more of their meat dishes, and also dessert. There’s only so much space in our tummies, but so many mouth watering choices

I really badly wanna go to this place after reading the review and recommendation from others and indeed i was disappointed when I tried their food there. The food was just average and the chendol was lousy. My first time & that will be my last
5
Was recommended by mfriends/family. we had the jimbaran platter (suitable for 2 pax)... it was so good. definitely not my last time. Price was affortable. location was exactly Opp great world citY. Those taking the public transport and hop on great world city's free shuttle orchard area(i know theres 1 at lucky plaza bus stop & ngee ann city)... the staffs were friendly and recommended us a few dishes too. good experience!
4
We have visited this restaurant a few times throughout the years. Recent visit we order tumpeng mini, lontong cap gomeh (best dishes according to me during this visit), chicken soup (soto ayam), chicken satay, and rissoles (this rissoles I have been ordering since 2010 when java kitchen sell it in their vivo city branch)My husband actually like their rawon, taste quite nice. My son like their nasi timbel (the rice so fragrant and fried chicken taste not bad). I also like their Nasi Kampung.The service is ok. Waiter quite friendl
5
Excellent food, serene surroundings. My experience at IndoChilli has always been great. They have consistently maintained high standards in their food.
An absolute Must Try for Food lovers
5
Indochili is definitely one of the best places in Singapore to try indonesian cuisine. The Ikan goreng kremes is yummy and you should also try their avocado milkshake, ambience is great and the staff are nice and helpful
4
I came here a few times during my stay nearby, it's a good place. I'm a fan of their tahu telor (reminds me a bit of home), and their various ayam gorengs. The chicken portions are on the smallish side, but are cooked well - crispy on the outside while juicy and marinated on the inside.The sambals are not as spicy as I would have liked, but have good flavour nevertheless.Desserts are quite good too. I'll definitely come and eat here if I find myself in the area.Though, when you order, make sure you get them to repeat your order. I had a small issue where they mistook my order and brought out more dishes that we had wanted. But it was rectified quickly and politely, so no issue really
4
I have been to Indochilli twice and I ordered the green ayam curry and the ayam bumbu rujak (grilled pomfret). My fave is the green ayam curry where the spicness is just nice for my liking, the portion is decent and goes well with white rice. The chicken is succulent and tender. The grilled pomfret is drenched with sweet sauce and it helps that the fish was served relatively quickly and we could taste the freshness. Overall the location is great and the ambience is cosy for a friends gathering. Cheers

Tried their Tumpeng Mini rice set and Sate Ayam Madura. Its taste and portions were excellent! The flavor of the meat was very rich and it goes well with the yellow rice. The perkedel have a unique texture to it that makes it stands out from the other dishes of its kind. By the end of the meal I was so full that I don't have stomach for deserts. 10/10 will come again

Had a delicious meal! We had the avocado, it's not like a drink as its thick & creamy, indeed value for money. My favourite dish at Indochili is sate ayam! Meat was so tender, fatty & easy to slip off the stick. The sauce is really savoury too. Seasoning of udang bakar was good. The food were served fast & that's always a plus poin

It was out first time to Indo Chili and we were recommended by our friends to visit this restaurant. This restaurant has a Javanese feel to it. Makes one feel pretty at home upon stepping into the restaurant. The menu has an extensive range of dishes to choose from. However, since there were only 2 of us, we had no choice but to control our cravings for the other dishes. We ordered Tahu Telor, Ikan Bakar Kecap, Ayam Panggang Padang and the famous Beef Rendang. We each also ordered the Avocado juice and Durian juice (Yes!!!! It’s durian juice!!)The avocado juice was awesome!! It wasn’t overly sweet and it actually tasted refreshing, I wish I could have this everyday. For the durian juice, they actually use real durian! Not sure what they blend it with, but u know you’re eating the real stuff, very GAO!! Maybe it’ll be better if he ordered that for dessert. Now to the mains. The tahu telor’s portion was huge! When we saw it, we were shocked… how are we going to finish the rest of the dishes? The tahu was fried to perfection. Crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The concoction of cucumber, carrot and beansprouts together with the peanut sauce and crispy prawn crackers were heavenly! Sinful but refreshing! Now to ikan bakar kecap. I was never a fan of fish, never. But this fish just proved me wrong. It was….OH MY GOSH!!!! I loved it!! The fish was marinated with Indonesian sweet soy sauce and chargrilled to perfection! Highly recommend!Ayam Panggang wsa so well marinated that the flavours seep not only into the skin, but into the meat too! How awesome! Our last main…..BEEF RENDANG!!! This was what I have been waiting for! The meat was slow cooked for at least 4 hrs! This explains why the meat was so soft and tender! The spices weren’t too overpowering too, it was very well balanced. We wanted to order desserts but there was no more room for dessert. The mains were so delicious that we gobbled them all leaving no room for dessert. Oh well, we’ll definitely be back for more and this time, we’ll bring more friends

The teak furnishing, indonesian chinese-styled decor and spacious interior make for a good dining experience. The restaurant wasn't especially packed when we were there (we arrived after 8pm on a Sunday night and hungry), but the food was still fast to arrive by any standards. I would recommend the kangkung, which was really crunchy and well flavored, and Ayam Bumbu Rujak for the creamy chilli taste. The grilled promfret in sweet sauce was a little let down for me as it was overcooked. Overall, I think this place is worth a try, it is located right opposite Great World City

A last minute decision on a Friday night for some authentic Indonesian food in Singapore found us at Indochill. What a great little find, the place was busy which was a good sign but there was one table left outside, albeit next to the road but no matter. In future might be better to book. The menu is pretty full with a large variety of quite simply delicious looking food. My beef rendang was beautiful - moist, soft, flavoursome and just the right texture and taste. The Nasi Goreng Seafood was FULL of seafood, so much variety too. Will definitely be back. Delicious

You know a place is good when even their rice is tasty! The turmeric rice here is excellent: tasty, fluffy, light. Everything else here is simply divine, from their tauhu telur to their rendang and their various chicken dishes and soups. Prices are very reasonable. For me, probably the best place in Singapore for Indonesian food

The food here is not very authentic, or maybe just from a different region of Indonesia I'm not used to. I'll go again if I need a quick bite and have a craving for Indonesian food.

This restaurant was small but the service and meal were big on value. The service was quick, the meal excellent and the staff were very friendly

First time I visit this place, a bit surprise with the price. But after taste the food, the price is reasonable. Soto Ayam there is very nice. I very like it.
Good place to enjoy your lunch with Family and friends.

Strongly recommend the curry chicken. Not too spicy and tasty at the same time. Perfect balance!
The durian coffee is another great signature drink of the house that probably can't find anywhere else in Singapore.

We ate here on all 4 nights of our 4 day stop over in Singapore and had something different each night. One night we shared a serve of butterflied grilled prawns, chicken skewers and wok stirred spinach with fish paste. Wow what a flavour hit superb. The restaurant is well staffed and friendly.A variety of fresh and bottled. Beverages are available

IndoChili Indonesian Restaurant serves top notch traditional Indonesian food with a rich heritage. The owner was inspired by her grandmother and came up with dishes infused with lots of herbs and spices which are beneficial to health and yet very delicious!Some of the dishes which i recommend:Oxtail soup is really robust and I truly enjoyed it.Tumpeng Mini, rice was extremely fragrant and meat of the chicken very tender too.Their grilled platter is something worth trying as well. Grilled pomfret covered with sweet sauce is very tantalizing.Full review here: http://ilovedawn00.blogspot.sg/2014/10/food-review-indochili.htm

My image of Indonesia cuisine tends to overlap with Malaysian cuisine--a lot of Sambal, spices, rich gravy that contains coconut and that belachan that gives the dishes a very defining "shiok"-ness. After visiting Indochilli, I like to add an essential word to the list and that is "sweetness".As a spicy food lover with a sweet tooth, I love the fact that most of the dishes are not shy on the sugar which gives them more character. For instance, the Chicken Satay Madura ($7.80 for 5 sticks) featured juicy charcoal-grilled chicken dressed in sweet peanut sauce. However, I felt that the Tahu Telor ($8.80) and the Gado Gado ($6.80) could hold the sugar in tighter rein. That said, the omelette in the Tahu Telor was deep-fried till puffy, creating a delectable textural contrast with the beancurd and the dark luscious chunky peanuts. The first few mouthfuls of the Cah Kangkong ($8.80) were too salty, but somehow the spice and sourness began to emerge as we dig further down where a pool of red liquid could possibly dilute and balance the overall flavour. I had to restrain ordering anything too spicy since the little one has yet develop her tolerance for spicy food. So for families with kids, the ikan baker ($21.80)-- grilled fish in Indonesian sweet soy sauce, might be a safe option but do not that there is still hints of spiciness. It would be a bonus if the fish was fresher. For full review visit blog under user's profile

Located at Zion road, here you can feel as if you are in a traditional java house. All the foods are authentic indonesian javanese style. From the satay till the rawon, all of the foods here are quite memorable as an indonesian who is living in singapore.But, still you can not compare the foods here with what you can get in indonesia. I feel, there is still lack of something. Not sure whether is it the spices here are more expensive, and therefore the taste is not too strong, or because they modified the foods here for singaporean customer. Anyway, it is still a nice javanese restaurant

The ayam goreng cabe hijau is heavenly! I've eaten it a few times and still loving it. The green chilli flavour and spiciness combine with the fried chicken, gives unforgettable taste. Taste excellent with strawberry tea. The taste of tea and strawberry is well balanced and soothes the throat. Perfect restaurant for family and friends
