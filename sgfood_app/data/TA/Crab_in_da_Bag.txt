We enjoyed the good food. It'll be a good idea to order smaller portions instead of a full bag of mixed seafood so you get to try the various sauces they have.
5
The staff are Attentive and very helpful. The food was good and the theme of the eatery was nice as well. No complains.
3
Food is quite nice. Services is good as well.
But price is too high. Choices of food is quite limited too.
4
Nice ambiance, we were sat at a huge table for a party of 3. The friendly server has recommended great combination of seafood with their best sauces. We had a great dinner.
4
Every visit brings a new surprise, great collection of freshest seafood cooked innovatively for the whole family!
3
Food was tasty and atmosphere was acceptable although rather dead because of the location. Everything seemed somewhat overpriced. A simple meal and drinks between 2 friends cost more than $200 for a simple restaurant.
5
Have a great experience as the staff there were great. They are friendly and provide great service throughout our time there.
As it was my dad birthday they also have surprise for him.

Was invited to dinner in c rt ab da bag location quite hard to find.The restaurant decor was cool, staff friendly we order a bag mix seafood some side dish chips and cuttlefish and a beer towelThe beer towel was very impressive unique unsual. Very nice.The seafood was very fresh but the price is really expensive lucky there's a promotion on pave coupon.The owner was walking around and talking to guest very nice lady she offer us her mum pasta compliments was very nice, but much as I like the food I would not go back because is expensive ( maybe because of high rent)Is a different dinning experience o ce is enough
4
We celebrated our dear friend's bday there last night. We'd recommend that you try the various yummy sauces by ordering one type of seafood with each sauces instead of an all in one bag. Loved ALL the sauces! Well done, CIDB! Just one advice, stick to seafood - chic wings were good but seafood was better!!I'll def go back for more
3
Crab in da Bag moved from Big Splash to Chai Chew Techno Park. It is much accessible compared to East Coast Parkway. We ordered Caesar Salad as our appetizer. It was super delicious, crunchy and the cream was well blended with the veggies. We ate fried chicken wings, cray fish and squid. Not bad too. We liked the salad best. Good ambience for group gathering.
3
The restaurant was packed when we visited, but thankfully, we had made prior reservation. The seafood was relatively fresh, but the supposedly medium sized crab (which we topped up money for) yielded little flesh. Overall, an average experience. I prefer Dancing Crab.
4
The staff was well mannered and service was prompt. I forgot to use my e-coupon at the end of the dinner, but the staff was kind enough to let me reverse the transaction and use the coupon later on. Excellent!
5
We always visit Crab in da Bag whenever we visit Singapore. It's amazing seafood and we never get enough of it.
Recommended foods include any Crab cooked with the Caboodle Sauce, and the prawns with the salted egg yolk sauce!
5
Well, the food is really great as recommended by my wife, different people have different taste preferences, therefore the choice of the sauce might be a little tricky.
4
First experience here. Ordered the Titanic Pot. Was disappointed that it did not come with their signature sauces. But felt so much better to find that the seafood was fresh and that they go well with the typical sauces (sambal, thai and lemon garlic). There were two crabs and a lobster in the mix. The sausages are from a halal supplier. The staff offered to cut up our crabs and lobster at our table. Wonderful service
5
Will come again for sure our next gathering gonna try the $399 it look was so yummy fresh awsome.. Will be nice if there a flour to mix up with it. Such as cilli crab flovour curry etc it was so much fun to spend the time wit
5
We ordered that one bucket of mixed seafood. The seafood is great. They are fresh and it does not have the fishy smell that lingers in your hands. The condiments that they serve are also good. The staff are prompt and corteous. The service is as good as the food that they serve. You need to take a walk at the beach near the resto because for sure you will have a full stomach after your meal...the seafood here is irresistible
5
This is our umpteenth dinner here and each time has been delightful as ever.Start with a portion of the house fries. I guarantee you these are the best fries you have eaten anywhere ever! Yes they are that good. Get an ice lemon tea to wash down. Standard vending machine fare here.Next are the mains. Choose a mix, the spice levels, the additions and the main seafood you want. Delicious selection of squid clams mussels sri lankan crab alaskan king crab prawns crayfish etc.I like to a portion of spiced rice to go with the curry. And we never leave behind a single bit. Mop it all up always.The best part - no plates or cutlery at the restaurant. Food is served on the table literally and you have to use your hands. For the less adventurous there is plastic cutlery available on demand but it kinda kills the experience.Evenings are usually busy. Weekends are packed
4
One of the very few restaurants where u do not have to feel embarrassed to eat with your hands & get all dirty! Although a little costly, the seafood's fresh & yummy! U basically pick the seafood u want & how u'd like them cooked, service is not bad either! Better to call to make a reservation before heading down as it's usually packed! PS: not very environmental friendly though as pretty much everything (bibs, cutleries, cups etc) used in the restaurant is disposable.
5
The moment my family and I step into the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly and enthusiastic staff. We ordered the titanic pot and it took around 20mins to reach our table. Food serve was hot and definitely taste good with the sauce. Was given a free refill of sauce by one of the staff. The environment of the restaurant was cosy and the decorations makes you feel like you are dining in a boat. Definitely a must to visit if you are looking for a place to eat seafood in a different type of concept. Price was a bit steep but we still enjoyed ourself! Will definitely come back and recommend all my friends to this place. Thank you
4
The reservation was organised and double confirm via mobile before the dinning time. Staffs from Crab in Da Bag were polite . Food served were delicious too. Worth making repeat trip and recommend to friends to dine in Crab in Da Bag
4
Crabs, Shrimp and all kinds of seafood, served in a very nice style. In a plastic bag with all types of dip. Very nice
Waiters a bit over stressed but still ok
4
Food and service good, only bad point is price too steep, which affects the value for money part. Overall is satisfied with the meal.
5
Staff was friendly and more than happy to make recommendations. Food was fantastic and fresh too. Restaurant ambience was nice too. Worth the price.
5
The seafood was really fresh and service was good too! Staff were very helpful and friendly! It was a great experience!
5
My daughter was very happy to get to meet the mascott, birthday wish granted THANK YOU! Her expression was priceless when the announcement was made, very very happy 😊
5
Friendly staffs n nice environment
Good food but a bit expensive
Would be best if the prices are lower
4
Headed there for Father's Day dinner. Service and ambience were excellent and enjoyable. A really different experience digging into dinner at a restaurant with our hands.
3
Was there first time tonight to try out their seafood dishes. Staff was friendly and after some recommendations, we ordered the tiger prawns with salted egg yolk paste, Venus clams in butter sauce, fried squid, and of course our favourite Alaskan king crab. The prawns and clams tasted fine although the baby squid could have been a tad crispier. Then came the last dish which was what we always love. However, upon the first taste, all three of us commented it was bland and flat. We asked the restaurant supervisor or manager and politely told her so. She asked to taste it and commented that it tasted ok. So we were left with 1.5 kg of crab and what else to do but to try it, hopefully we were wrong in the first instance. We dug into the long legs and we must say it really tasted flat. Had to ask for more sauces to provide some taste and to finish the dish. What a sad way to end the dinner. I mean, everything was fine except the star dish was a dud. Mind you, the flesh was firm but it must have been one of those unfortunate "frozen" ones. Paid the bill in full but guess this visit was not a great first time for us.

The food and decoration are really nice, service is good and the prices are ok.However, as a true environmentalist, I just can't eat in a restaurant where they use plastic everywhere!Bags, utensils, glasses, table "clothe"! This is unacceptable in 2016 when we are talking so much about protecting our planet and these guys are actually producing so much waste! I was really disappointed to see this and I won't go back to Crab In Da Bag unless they find a way to avoid the use of so much plastic waste.
4
My 2nd visit to this place. Have tried 2 other similar restaurants but I prefer the butter-garlic style here..
Not able to have Alaska crab this time.. what a waste..
4
the food is yummy and nice decorations. feel like I am on a ship having seafood. enjoyed my experience there.
4
Service & the staffs are good, food is tasty hot ...
I would consider this dinner for 2 pax as expensive ...
4
Crab was that tasty and was costly despite the 'Titanic' (cost $304- includes one crab, lobster, a few prawns,crayfish and corn) not having much food.
Service,however, was amazing. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
2
Website price stated on website and menu at restaurant did not tally. The Sri-lankan crab in the gigantic pot was small and not very fresh. Would not recommend going again. Although the lobster was good.
5
This is our 3 visit and as usual we enjoy the place and the meal a lot.It is a fun place where we need not worry about table manner.The food is serve in a plastic bag season with the seasoning of our choice. We just pick the food off the bag and enjoy the succulent taste.The shell and bones can just be thrown on the table, we are also given a bib to wear, so there is no worry of getting our clothes dirty.The waiting staff are attentive and friendly. We can always chat with them.As the place is stuated beside the beach, one can always take a stroll at the beach to burn off the guilt feeling.Highly recommended from me
3
Warm staff welcomed us by the door. The menus are varied, usual choices from mild, medium spicy to super spicy. The food delivered to us somwhere from 10 to 20 minutes. Clean surroundings...but I guess one can appreciate the surroundings if one eats there lunchtime--you can see the Singapore greens outside, as the restaurant is enclosed in glass. It's a new experience...you have the whole table as your plate :-)))One gets to eat with your bare hands (the best way to eat when eating crabs and shrimps)... I only give 3 stars because as a health conscious eater, I am not comfortable with hot foods being served in plastic containers..but then, eating in this way once in a while won't hurt, so it's worth your try! :-
5
Heard alot of reviews saying the place isn't as good or that it's overpriced.Greeted with staff who gave good recommendation and food was amazing. For the range and variety of seafood we had, I personally felt it was decently priced. Would definitely go there again (
5
A business colleague took me to this restaurant. It had some of the best and freshest seafood I have had. They brought a bucket of freshly cooked crabs prawns and lobster to the table and then tipped it over the plastic cloth and we ate our way through the delicious pil
3
My reserved dine in was late hence there were 2 tables, 2&3 indian patrons respectively, and 3 of us in another table, unfortunately we were not given free deserts (watermelon in color n shape) where the other 2 tables had it, we felt left out, it deprised me. I'm not hard up for it but should this not be fair ....Jus feel the mgmt should look into this
4
We had a good time there as the staffs were friendly & the service was great. Not forgetting the nice embience and we love what we ordered 😋
We felt very much at home and enjoy the moment there.
4
Service was good. Food was served in a timely manner. Cider draft was a first for me. The tiger prawns was awesome. And that is saying quite a lot from someone who don't like eating prawns!
5
Ambience, food quality, customer service, speed are of quality. This is my 6th visit! And every visit is an enjoyable and memorable experience
5
Freshness of seafood cater all at age group. Staffs are very friendly to everyone of us. Service is excellent !
4
My elderly parents enjoyed the experience of eating with bare hands and eating seafood in this manner
5
I have to start off by saying to all of you to not come here if you are not ready to have only the best seafood. With the freshest catches, they created a unique dining experience in which even my Captain's Bucket was poured directly onto the table (covered with a piece of plastic of course). Prawns in a bag - well, I would've loved to see my sister dunk her face into it. Any visitor here must try the salted egg Sri Lankan crab. I promise you - you'll only come back for more. Price? Well worth it
5
We decided to have our dinner at this outlet located at the former big splash at East Coast Park. It has a great ambience of a big ship with the "sailors" (waiters and waitresses) on board. Blue and white colour are the main deco time and the lively serving expression of the wait staff makes the whole dining experience even more memorable. When the food came costing about $299 per serving, it was spread on the table, the aroma of the steamed crabs, lobsters, prawns and other shell fish just triggered our appetite further. This dining experience is wonderful for big gathering of family, colleagues n friends. Give it a try! Thumb u
3
Reached the restaurant by 5 pm. on weekday and no queue. The restaurant is facing sunlight and quite hot. Seems that air condition is not powerful enough. We order Titanic Pot and staff will pour all boiled-seafood on the table. Alaskan King crab is shortage and they replace with other seashell. While Boston Lobster meat is firm and delicious but SriLankan crabs' meat is not firm. Thai dipping sauce is spicy but delicious when compare with other 2 (Malay and Louisiana).
4
Order either specific seafood or if you have a large group - get their giant pots!The specific seafood comes with a choice between 4 different sauces for each one and you can add on sides for carbs in anyone. The service staff is friendly and always ready with recommendations for the pairing of seafood and sauce. The dishes really do come in a bag and you have the option of keeping it in the bag or they can pour it onto the table for you. The seafood is fresh and worth the price. If you wear white, they have bibs specially to protect your clothes.
4
A great place for a stress-free meal, by that i mean you don't have to worry which utensil is meant for the next dish. It is perfectly alright to be messy here.The menu looks intimidating, but it's actually fairly easy to understand. 1st u have to decide what you want to eat... then u choose the seasoning and what other things u want to add. in my case, we ordered prawns and crab. The staffs were friendly and patient to explain and recommend which seasoning is good. We settled for carboodle mix crab and salty splash prawn. Basically it's garlic butter crab and salted egg prawn... haha!For $60+ per crab, it's a little expensive... but the freshness of the crab and the final product was worth it! The sauce was tasty and compliments the crab very well, i especially liked the fact that the whole "dish" was laid out on the table and we just need to "attack" with our hands... the prawns was great as well! Succulent and fresh, not over cooked. Though after eating a few, we kinda wished we swapped the seasoning with the crab!In fact, we liked it so much that we were contemplating whether to go back again the next day! But we decided not to due to various reasons. I would totally recommend them to all seafood lovers! I, for sure will be visiting them again
5
Overall is a good experience & great service. Food is good. Staff is able to give good advice on the food recommendation.
4
First time there, Staff was able to recommended a good mix of food. Almost over ordered. Relaxing atmosphere
3
A little too expensive compared to other similar restaurants serving the same kind of food. Food ok but is too oily. However, all the service staffs were very friendly. Overall, good experience.
4
Excellent service from the staffs. Fufill my request to celebrate my fiance birthday by giving complementary dish, sing birthday song and cute crayfish mascot.
4
Staff were friendly, food was good, especially the crab with the caboodle sauce, great combination for mussels with sausage. Lobster was good but a little small
4
The seafood are fresh and waiting time is short.
The restaurant ambience is cosy ,my kids enjoyed the food very much.
1
The seafood was not fresh at all. service and staff is top level. I went with family. was worry my kids may get bellyache after. but lucky everyone is fine. The crab they give us has awful smell. although they change for us. but the 2nd one still not very fresh. most important for a seafood restaurant is the freshness of the seafood. on this point they failed. we will not visit again. will look for other replacement
4
No plates, and food is served on the table on a huge piece of waterproof paper. We ordered lobster and prawns cooked in different flavours. I love the salted egg version.They also have sides, i.e. rice, sweet potato fries, sweet corn. It's quite an experience eating food off the table with your bare hands! Quite pricey but worth the dining experience
5
I'm not much of a seafood eater but this place was really awesome. Me and some friends got one of their big pots full of crab, lobster, prawns, bratwurst, corn, squid, onions, potatoes, and some other stuff. They come and dump it out on to the table and its a feast going forward from there.The sauces were all delicious. The seafood was probably the freshest i have ever had in singapore.Nice to be able to walk along the waterfront afterwards. Highly recommend for a night out with friends. much less stuffy and a better value than other chilli crab places around town
4
After a welcome to your table, a big plastic sheet is laid over it with plastic aprons for you to wear while you wait for your food to be cooked.The whole place is decorated as if you are on a yatch and the wait staff are in sailor blue and white attire with warm smiles.The cooked food is served in plastic bag and brought to you in white steel buckets. The plastic bags of food are tied and flipped upside down and then sipped in the centre and placed as "plates" and the wonderful aroma of seafood permeates over you.Very fresh seafood of 8 tiger prawns, big squid, medium Venus sweet clams and Sri Lanka crab of 600gms @ S$65 with your choice of sauces of salted butter, garlic, curry powder and Louisana spices.As the pairing of sauces were new to me and I have held up the order for a while I didnt request for the crab to be "cracked" by the kitchen to my regret as it took sometime to crack it with the given pincer as it is hot and slippery. All goes well with the beer of S$10 and apple cider @ S$9. The total bill for 3 was S$179 tho pricey worth the experience, fun and fresh seafood.A complimentary honey dew with jelly was given as a nice ending
2
Services from the staffs are good.
But the taste and standard of food dropped tremendous. Not worth the price to pay for.97253287
5
Gd service n attentive staff. Good a bit pricey cN consider giving dicounts to senior citizens or students
5
Excellent service by the staffs and food is tasty & seafood are fresh. The staff actually took time to explain and recommend the food combinations.
4
The ambience there is nice n cozy n peaceful, I love it.
The sauce is nice but however the crab is very difficult to crack. Other restaurants serve crab too but very easily to crack even with bare hands
4
eatery on the pricey side, but service was good. staff constantly walked over to check that all was fine. staff recommendations were yummy
4
Nice outing with friends. Friends enjoyed the crabs and prawns and finished bloated with smiles all round !
5
Good food and service! It was my family's first experience in the restaurant. They were simply impressed by the quality of food and service.
5
It was a very enjoyable experience dining here. Food is good, staffs are fast and attentive. Worth the $ paying for. Highly recommend. Will definitely go again

Since I saw the first restaurant open at East Coast, I've been curious to give it a try. Yesterday, we finally got the chance to dine at their Stadium branch. The positives: Good location, lovely interior/decor, very clean, super friendly and accommodating staff. You just gotta love the energy inside the restaurant. The downside? Well, to be honest, the food failed to wow. And it's a little on the pricey side. For the price that you're expected to shell out if you get the whole Crab in da Bag experience which is about 100++, you can already have an amazing seafood buffet experience at Pan Pacific, Shangri La or DB Moderne at Marina Bay Sands, for example. Still, it was good to have tried it so I won't have to wonder anymore.:
2
I was shocked to receive the bill of ~$1,040 for my group of 10 adults. We ordered 2 pots, 3 towers of beer and some finger food.The portions were small and probably adequate for 6-7 adults. Lots of potatoes, little seafood. While the taste and freshness are generally fine, they are not excellent. I'll give the food a rating of 3 stars at best.Many of my colleagues fed-back that they havent even had a crab or lobster, even though we ordered a Gigantic Pot and a Titanic Pot which should cover 10 pax properly. At $100 per pax, we expected a lot more. After all, we would have many other options i.e. hotel buffets with free flow of crabs/lobsters/oysters, chinese restaurants, etc. If the bill was $700+, i would've been ok. 1 star for the value.All in all, we will not become repeat customers due to the lack of value. Next time, we will get coupons off Groupon or somewhere similiar and enjoy feasts at less than half the price we paid at CIDB
5
Staff were prompt in service. They were polite and suggested stuff for us to order as we were first timers. Food was good. Service was good. Great experience.
4
we enjoyed the food, service and ambience of the restaurant, a bit pricey though.. worth a try for seafood!
5
Was at the east coast branch with friends from overseas. They were impressed with the good food and excellent service
4
If you don't mind the pricing, this will be an awesome place to visit. Staffs are friendly and chill location for family and friends!
3
The food's fantastic, but the service of the staff sucks. You can call for their attention and they can look at you and ignore you completely.
5
Truly a fantastic place to dine with family and friends. Not to mention kids will also enjoy the kiddie meal that comes with a dessert and drink. Ambience is very cooling and service is at its best.
4
A very pleasant experience, staff are really friendly and helpful. The food were good but too expensive. Overall we enjoyed our meal there.
1
The pricing is ridiculous! One kg of Sri Lanka crab is S$100! You can get super delicious crab for half the price at any of the seafood restaurant along east coast. Furthermore, the taste is blend and without any character. Ordered prawns, crab, fillet of fish and they served super slowly despite rushing them.. After a while, the waiter just ignore you!!!.... The prawns came after 30 minutes of waiting (btw. Their one serving of prawns is only 9 pieces....). Then had to wait another 45 minutes for the crab to arrive... It's supposed to be Sri Lanka crab but the biggest they had was only 600g and smaller than the local mud crab you can find in other restaurants..... Overall, super bad experience.... Will recommend anyone thinking of visiting to go home, buy 1 kg of crab or prawns, boil it in garlic and butter and you will end up with better tasting food than what you can get at Crab in da bag and 1/4 the price
5
The most craziest dinner I've ever had !! Can you imagine a restaurant where you eat on the table !?-I mean on the table yes ! no plate ! just a plastic bag , and can I tell you as simple is that concept as delicious it is !!!Ben Harper said once : Make it simple but significant .... They did it, and it is a success !Congratulation !

We were hunting for a new dining experience and chanced upon this place. It was located at an obscure corner near Big Splash but it's a pretty big and bright place. Music isn't loud so it's a good place to chat and chow down. Place is very clean and the ambience is inviting. Even before stepping in, the staff stepped out to greet us and explained the menu when we mentioned it's our first visit. After being seated, another staff, Dussha, helped us with recommendations and wasn't pushy with the order though admittedly we were pretty undecided especially with the pairings of food with the 5 different sauces.Food came pretty quick and piping hot in interesting clear bags which were turned around and snipped, (no easy war to explain this). Placed in front of us, the fragrance wafted up and smelt really good. Sauces were not overbearing and went well with the Sri Lankan crab, tiger prawns, squid and Venus clams. Each in separate bags with different sauces. All I can say is the food is good. Now as many have read my reviews before, I always am looking for issues. The only 2 things I can think of are firstly, the washing area does not have a mirror for us to check for gunk on the teeth. Very essential if you're out on a date. Secondly, the washroom at least for the guys, is tiny. They were pretty optimistic placing 2 urinals right opposite the single sink with a tiny mirror. Won't be a problem if you're skinny but I'm not so it's an issue with me. Yes, these are insignificant considering the plus points. Highly recommended for large groups though my visit was date night with wifey. Ok, enough for this review. Now to take a walk by the beach with my love. Yes, it is by the beach...another plus..
5
Great service as all the stuff talk nicely and they know their product well when they are recommending their food to me
5
Good service, good food :) Staff were friendly, reservation was made quickly and when arrived we were sitted immediately!! :)
5
Crab in da bag excellent service, but think not suitable for family with kids to eat coz majority of the food, kids would not like to eat.
5
Love the fresh seafood and staff are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely come for more. Atmosphere is great.
5
My parents-in-law visiting from Sweden could not stop praising the food. My 9-yr-old son loved the place so much that he decided to ask for a piece of paper to write a personal review.
4
Great Food, Good Service! No cutlery!
East Coast still serves better food and faster food serving.
Definately returning again and again!
Missing the alaskan crab legs though... both previous visits all no stock.
4
Gad my new year's eve dinner at 9pm. Service staff took time to recommend the menu. First time there and kids enjoyed the food. Ordered 3 mains 1 kids meal, 3 sides, 3 drinks and total damage was close to $200. Serving not very big either. But overall, satisfied customer :
5
The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming... Waiter informed us of items not available on the menu for the day upon showing us the menu (very professional)... The food was wonderful, order the crab and mussels, the seafood is very fresh... and the best is you can enjoy it with your hands... Haha will definitely return for more..

Last Friday, my wife and I were driving along east coast road looking tor a food fix.Saw this restaurant, walked in and had a good food experience. I must commend Isham, he waited on us and showed us to our table. Did what he had to do and much much more. He is like a old friend's young son to me from way back, that you see him and say - hey, look at you, you are going places young man!You can't go wrong with fresh seafood here. Plus nice ambient. Seafood should be eaten this way, just pure hands, lots of table room to work on, can get all messy and sloppy. Fun! And, plenty of napkins available to clean up afterwards.From the servers, to even the cashier - all very cheery and pleasant.If you are looking for an alternative to the usual east coast seafood restaurant grub. Crab in da Bag is a good choice. Da choice!PS: What is missing here? Captain Hook
3
Love the fresh catch from the sea and the way they're prepared so the seafood's natural flavour is retained. Presentation's unique and fuss free. Staff are friendly and attentive. My toddler was running around the restaurant at one point and one of the staff decided to offer her a complimentary jelly to keep her seated. Thumbs-up for the staff's attentiveness and initiative. If the price could be further adjusted lower to make seafood more affordable, would be the best seafood makan deal in town! ;
4
Celebrated my Friend birthday there and it was gd. Food was amazing as usual and the staff are feeling helpful and friendly.
4
Warm and welcoming service. Prompt and attentive. Good food, albeit pricey (hence 4 stars) and beer was a bit pricey for the volume.
Would recommend, but colesterol and budget limit visits to once a month.
5
The sea food is very very fresh. The style is also new and creative. Waiter/waitress are humorous and friendly. A good experience and Highly recommend.
3
Compared to the fact they ran out of king crab legs . A lobster that had cold claws, tough body meat ..and squid that smelled ... It was really overpriced .. Paid 370+ for this ... Miserable amount of seafood to be honest
4
We had to wait quite long for the food due to the shortage of manpower but they were quick to realize and gave us complimentary dessert as a gesture of apology. Food has always been great. Our 2nd time, compared to similar concept restaurants, crab in the bag is the best. They even had special birthday requests. It was raining and they even offered us the umvrella to our car. Would definately go back again!
4
We came to know about Crab in da Bag sometimes ago. First time trying the seafood. I thought its very unique; different from most seafood joint. Best of all, its fresh! The sauces are well prepared, taste good. The services is good and staff are friendly. So if I think about fresh seafood, I would certainly revisit again. Must try
5
My parents love their food n always wanted to go back again after each visit. Been there many times and was never fail by the excellent service crew they had! They will always know how to recommend the type of cooking for each dish we choose! Even when I request to seat outside coz I had my pet along, they still serve us the same everyone ! Was really glade to be there n most importantly, we always enjoy our food !
4
My husband and I happened to be in the vicinity and thought we'd pop into Crab In Da Bag for dinner. Turned out to be a very pleasant experience - from the hearty greeting "Ahoy! Welcome aboard!" to the delicious seafood cuisine - it was a worthwhile first try! Kudos to the wait staff for cheery service
4
This was my first visit to crab in da bag, to celebrate my mom's birthday.Parking was right beside the restaurant, very convenient. We made prior reservations and they called the day before to confirm the booking as well as verbally explained the birthday surprise which they planned for my mom.The day itself, there was an automated telephone call to confirm again the booking.We were given the middle seat in front of the counter, and the staff were friendly and helpful in explaining the menu to us. My parents were pleasantly surprised that there were no plates and they could eat comfortably like at home - with their hands and all! :)At the end, they had a lobster mascot that came out and played birthday songs for my mom as a surprise. They even prepared a desert with a candle - which were complimentary. That was lovely..Food -wise we had 5 adults, and opted for their Titanic pot. That day they had no alaskan crab legs nor yabbies and was replaced with another crab (so instead of 2 crabs we had 3) which was great cos we loved crabs and 6 pincers meant enough to go around! ^.^ The seafood was fresh and good, sauces went well with the food too. (: It was a lovely place, only thing not so convenient with public transport I think (anw, it's East Coast Park right..). So best to drive there. Price was about $76/pax, which I thought ain't too bad for seafood fresh enough to be just lightly steamed! It's not cheap, but you're definitely paying for quality
5
1) it is nice that to receive a confirmation call, it shows that how much you value your customer. 2) the staffs are nice too.. my family took quite a long time to discuss with each other with the order, the staff never show any u happiness but a smiling face all the time.3) It is another nice gesture to offer customer help in choosing the source. Overall, I enjoy dinning with you guys, such a good experience and I told my company about it also, so we will be visiting you guys again on 31.12.15. Hope to see you guys again. Thanks for the pleasant experience.

enjoyed our dinner there. good atmosphere and great service by the staff..
The Operation Manager, Isyham was very helpful and frienfly.
He helped us with the selection of the menus and we have no regret about it!!

Fun and messy dinner for family and friends. Hot fresh seafood will be "thrown" on your table. You eat with your bare hands and you will be given a plastic bib. Very messy but fun!

It was my first time there with the wife and kid and the food was delicious and crab was really fresh.
5
It was a great place to dine for my family and the seafood was so fresh! We ordered the titanic pot and it was sufficient for the 4 of us, filled us all up really good. Everything in it was so tasty! The staff were all very pleasant and friendly, ready to help when we told them it was our first time dining there. Even got a surprise for my daughter's birthday - their lobster mascots and a cake! Will definitely return to dine again :

Went with my friends and we really enjoyed the food! The seafood is fresh! The concept was great, we just got messy eating the food with our hands and the staffs were very friendly. We tried all the different flavours of sauce that recommended by the staff and they are all awesome. Bit oily but damn good!Been here many times now, will definitely go again. This is definitely a must go to and must try if you have not been yet!

It's my 4th time visiting this place. Selection of sauce can be improved and maybe more dishes other than seafood can be added as my mum does not eat much seafood like prawns & crabs, last time if I rem correctly there was fish but not in the menu anymore this time. More salty egg sauce could be given too as we ordered crab & prawns with the sauce but feel that the sauce was insufficient. Otherwise food still very good, my family enjoyed themselves during dinner at Crab in da bag.
5
It is our first time dining at Crab in da Bag.. Upon arriving to the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the host and was escorted to our table.. The guy(sorry i did not get your name) who served us has a great customer service, great recommendation of foods which myself, my partner and our children enjoyed it :)... Kuddos to him..It happened to be on Halloween night and so a lady(i didn't get her name either), came to our table and after few words, she surprised us with a great Halloween dessert. Thank you so much for this arrangement, the kids love it..Lastly, I really enjoyed my simple Birthday celebration.. Most importantly, my children enjoyed the foods and the presence of the mascot.Thank you once again to the Crab in da Bag team!!Cheer

Made a reservation at 4.15pm and was quite surprised to find out that we were the only diners! It would have been better if there was a slight crowd just for the ambience of everyone enjoying their food at the same time.We ordered their Atlantic catch which was a promotion from 4-6pm with a little of everything. Even the beer was going on promotion at $6+ during that period! Overall it was a good experience but i could have done it with a little bit more salt. But thats just me
4
This is a great place to celebrate birthdays. Foods great, good range of drinks to go with the seafood and they can even arrange a lobster mascot to bring the cake out.
4
The titanic pot was very nice and dig out our food from the piles of shells is fun. It was a great experience, will definitely visit again.
5
Food is yummy..can taste the freshness of all the seafood😄
Will definitely visit again! Recommend for family looking for family bonding time. 😃
5
Nice food but be prepared to spend quite abit. It was a little expensive but we did have a sumptous meal.
4
Fresh crabs and prawns served in oils of your choice all in a bag. Different and interesting. A must visit for the experience of it all.
5
Great fun, friendly service, delicious food.Would highly recommend this joint if you've not been here before.
5
Very nice seafood, interesting concept & super friendly staff!
Only drawback is that we wished the sauces could be tastier!
4
Great service and music!Food, OK....especially the level of "spice", I'm not a chili eater, but we took the mild and max hot. Mild really nothing...and the max hot, quite mild actually...2 of my friends don't feel the "kick", as they are chili eater... (^^)And the place quite warm even they have air-con...Overall, is good for family and friends gathering, corporate dinner...but as for couple, its depends...its not a romantic place, but it was a fun place to dine! (^^
4
Take eating from a bag to a new level! (If you like to eat from a plastic bag, that is...)Good ambience, lot's of energy, smiling servers and decent food - great combo for at least 1-2 visits. So we ordered ala-carte "bags" rather than a whole Titanic or Gigantic pot and I wish we had because apparently the experience and the taste of a pot is quite different from eating from plastic bags. I am surprised they don't have the same cooking style if you don't order the $299 or $399 pots, which is a bit disappointing. Of course, in the end I spent $290 for ala carte bags and should've just ordered a pot instead. Will go back for the pot..

This is my first time to this restaurant. There’s a marine theme throughout the restaurant. When you walk in, the staff will welcome you with a cherry ‘Ahoy!’. Dining here is rather interesting… They will then lay your table with a long sheet of waxed paper, which you eat off, so you don’t get plates. But you do get forks and knives. Here are the highlights of the meal:- Crinkled Cauliflower: $8. This was a nice surprise. The cauliflower are cut into florets and fried, then sprinkled with special seasoning. We was happy munching into this, and before we knew it, it was finished! Nice. - Crispy Chewy Baby Squid: $12. This is done similar to cze-char style, where baby squid are cooked till they are crispy and its perfect with beer!- Salted Egg Yolk Tiger Prawns: $26. The legs of the prawns were trimmed and its cooked with salted egg yolk. The shells were so crunchy and tasty that they can be eaten together with the meat of the prawns. Another dish that reminds me of a good cze-char!- Mum’s Pasta In da Bag: $16. Linguine sauteed in their mum’s special sweet and sour brown sauce with venus clams and bratwurst sausages. The sauce is very oriental and it helps fill me up, cos of the carbo.- Titanic Pot: $299. This order is good for 4 pax. It’s a feast for the eyes and tummy… The staff comes with a big stainless steel pot and pours the seafood out onto the middle of the table. There’s 1 Boston Lobster, 2 Sri Lankan crabs, Alaskan crab legs, yabbies’, Tiger prawns, Boston Bay mussels, Venus clams, Bratwurst Sausages, Corn on the cob, potatoes, onions and lemons. These were cooked in a secret blend of Louisiana herbs and spices.The seafood were fresh and tasty. It came with 3 types of dips: Louisiana Garlic Butter dip, Malaysian sambal dip and Thai green bird chilli dip. Loved the Thai green bird chilli dip most. The corn deserved a call-out. It looked ordinary and I was expecting it to be bland. But 1 bite into it and I ate 6 of it! It was so sweet and juicy. Good stuff!- Live Venus Clams cooked in Ultimate Curry: $21. The clams are cooked in their signature Northern Malaysia curry mix, stir fried with aromatic curry leaves and chilli padi. I loved the way its presented to the table by the staff. Taste-wise its good. We also had a side of bread to dip into the sauce.I also had the lemonade which was nice and refreshing. It helped when the going (food) was hot and cooled me down. It’s a great meal and I enjoyed myself. Will be back here again

The so called novelty of eating out of plastic bags and on the table without plates is totally not worth it. Plus the food is bad along with the service, and not to say it is ridiculously overpriced! Will never ever recommend this to anyone!
2
Book online for this restaurant during one of the weekdays. Innovative way of eating the crabs but the food wasn't fantastic though and over priced for its quality and crab size. There are many other places with much better seafood than this restaurant.
4
A fun place with plenty of great seafood. We had two of the big buckets of seafood for a large group and it was great.
The lobsters were terrific as were the prawns and langoustines.
Not cheap but good quality
5
Service staff were excellent with superb tasty food. It was our first visit & they were very patience to explain and introduce what was good on their menu although restaurant is rather busy. Overall, thumbs up!!!
5
Definitely one of my favorite crab places in Singapore! Service was good, the food was great.
Personal favorites: Sri Lankan Crab and tiger prawns in their signature sauce, spiced rice and spiced fries. Loves the garlicky sauce!

This restaurant is okay with the chances of having Alaska king crab leg and Boston lobster. There isn't much choice of cooking method except boiling in the bag.There isn't any free ice water serve. Some of the items are overcooked.They have only two size to choose from. A S$299 (for 04 person) and S399 (for 06 person) portion. We order another tiger prawns portion inorder to make us fill full.All price in the menu execute 7% gst and 10% service charge.Their crispy fries are a must to order
3
There were 8 of us and we ordered different types of crab dishes. I only don't like the crab with curry. Too spicy for me. The fried chicken wing was delicious. The squid was okay. Our bill was around $300. I wont come back to dine here coz its way too expensive.
3
We were given a table near the washbasins. Despite the paper towels available, people kept flicking their hands after washing. When we requested for a change, the staff member was very understanding and quickly got another table further away. Food was ok for the kind of price charged. Service was generally good
4
service was good. friendly and helpful. first time there. crew assist and gave suggestion. waiting time not that long. usually depending on the crowd. but as we all know great food requires time to cook unless you want to eat raw food. overall dining experience was great. my wife and i enjoyed the experience there. although price is a little steep. :
5
Traveling to east coast was a pain due to NDP rehearsals and road diversions but the journey was so worth it! The staff were very helpful and very knowledgeable. We had trouble deshelling our crabs and lobsters and they actually grabbed some gloves and helped us with it! The food was enjoyable and very tantalizing. Would definitely recommend the caboodle dressing + spiced rice! Everything about this experience was great. Would definitely come back here again and again!
4
First timer at the restaurant. the service was excellent and the staffs are friendly and helpful. They are always ready to provide their assistance and advise on the menu. Adorable mascot!
5
It is great experience to eat without fork, knife and spoon. Great seafood with big variates of sources. Reasonable prices on beer and ciders.
Good menu for kids.
4
The service was good, atmosphere appropriate and relaxed, but most of the food was good. Only downside was price, but for Singapore standards, it was value for money
4
It's my 3rd time there & there definitely would be a fourth soon
It maybe a little expensive but worth the while

Another crab dinner this week, maybe its a wee bit bias as I have had 3 fantastic seafood dinners and then comparing for this restaurant.5 of us and shared a combo for S$299 which had a full size lobster, 1 crab, 2 Alaskan crab leg, 4 mini lobsters, 8 prawns, 4 jumbo sausages, a couple onions and lemon halves, 4 corns and maybe 20 clams and 10 mussels. Its boiled so not much taste, the sweetness of the fresh seafood is good enough! Came with 3 sauces: Tangy thai, red hot chili and garlic butter. I do not take spicy food so stick with the butter. With beer and soft drink, our bill came up to $389 nett.Really enjoyed eating off from the table top with bare hands, wished that the lobster, crab etc were more cracked so that us girls will not have to risk breaking our nails which trying to eat.Food = 5 starsService = a few young people serving, hip, fast etc... the problem is, they move too fast and does not listen. They hear a few words and they rushed off to do the deed, not staying and listening enough to know the full question. This resulted in several run-ins. Wished they could slow down and let us experience their great service which I am sure they are fully capable of.Another suggestion, sell soft drinks by can, and not by fountain. Their soda are so flat..

Went there on 6th May 2015 for the 1st time and return back on 10th May 2015 for Mother's Day Celebration . 4 person for the 1st visit and then with 9 person for the 2nd visit and was a great dining experience .Fresh Seafood and Great Service too except for the price came in a little on the high side but for the experience it is still ok . Kiddos loves it especially using the hand to enjoy the meal even for us adults . Once in a while to dine is ok but not everytime as I find it a little overpriced .

My husband loves seafood and so i brought here(our first visit) for our wedding anniversary. The decoration and the ambience of the restaurant was good. We choose the crab(Camboodie Mix) and the prawns(Ultimate Curry), The camboodie mix was good while the ultimate curry sauce was slightly salty. The waiting time for the prawns was quite long(30mins) and i approached the staff and the staff replied 'I did not order the prawns') after he went to the counter and checked. I did ordered and Im upset about this because its our special occasion and newly seated couples(came in 15mins after we were already seated and ordered) were already being served all their orders. Everything else was ok except for this
4
This is a casual and family oriented place. The concept is a little different - first time I've had my seafood poured onto the table. After that it's dig in with your hands and fingers. You also get a plastic bib to save your shirt from getting messy.The seafood was quite fresh and the sauce tasty. It's not cheap though
3
I have tried a few restaurants with the same Louisiana dining concept. I felt that there weren't much sidings to choose from that would be good with the seafood they served.Also, the different "flavors" for the seafood was not spectacular. Even their signature Caboodle Mix was nothing spectacular. I've had better tasting flavor elsewhere. Their Salty Sea flavor was too spicy for my taste. I also felt it needed more sauce. I ordered it for the tiger prawns, and because most of the flavoring was in the shell, you would at least want to dip the shrimp into the sauce. But there was no sauce to dip in.It is also too pricey for the taste. While I was eating, I thought about going to the other more conventional seafood restaurant instead
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the experience of rolling up our sleeves and getting our hands dirty. Seafood is so fresh cooked in butter? Sauces are so delicious. There's sambal belachan, lemon garlic pesto. Potato, maize and all varieties of seafood including lobster. 8 person will be just nice to go for the set. Friends who brought us were in their 60s. But I can't imagine my parents to enjoy food eaten this way, finger likin good. When we were there, the restaurant was fully booked for someone's 60th birthday. I find it pricey for fresh seafood cooked this way. I think it came close to $60 per pax without drinks and no service (comes in a can poured in front of you)
5
Food and service is finger licking good! Try the curry sauce with the crab. They serve this sweet cider which washes down the salty seafood very well. Will be back! Make a reservation if you're coming though, this place was full on a Friday evening!

When it comes to food, I suffer from multiple personality disorder. Sometimes, I crave refinement, creativity and some extravagance. And other times, I just want to pig out. When those urges get too strong, when I want the culinary equivalent of “dancing like nobody’s watching,” I can’t imagine a better way to set them free than to sit down and start cracking shells and stuffing face at Crab in da bag. It is crowded, messy and plenty fun.Each table is covered with a large sheet of coated paper. The crab arrives in plastic bags…. set in the middle of the table sheathed in clear plastic loaded with the sauce of your choice. The best dish was definitely tiger prawns in garlic butter. Sri Lankan crab in caboodle mix – a combo of local and Cajun spices – is out of this world….they combined beautifully. The crab farci was delightfully delicious. The word farci, when used in the description of a dish, means to ‘stuff’ or to ‘pad out’ (from the Latin,farcire). The prawns are first cleaned out and then cooked in their shells, ensuring maximum flavour. The sweetness of the prawns complemented the garlic sauce perfectly. Whenever I need a prawn-fix, I know where to go. The squid in curry had a very intense and specific flavour.If you don’t like eating with your hands, you should not even think about going there. No, this ain’t the place for restraint. It’s for anyone who speaks the international language of crab done right, and who wants to enjoy good seafood in a casual atmosphere. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

No plates, foods are served on the table with a huge piece of waterproof paper. We ordered 2 Sri Lankan crabs, cooked in different flavours (I love the Malaysian curry flavour). They also have sides, i.e. herbs rice, sweet potato fries, sweet corn. Quite pricey but worth the dining experience.
4
Food and service is really really good. Had the prawn with garlic butter sauce with a HOT spice added into it. Came in a bag so the prawns were soaking in the sauce. I made a side order of toasty bread which goes so well soaking up the remaining sauce and garlic. It tasted so good that I actually ordered another serving of bread to finish up the sauce. Had another side order of chewy squid and sweet potato fries as well. SO SO SO GOOD! The whole restaurant was decorated with a nautical theme. It was pleasant to look and eat in that environment. The only downside is the place is only accessible if you have a car or taxi. You have to walk 500m from the nearest bus stop which entitled you to climb a pedestrian bridge.Would love to come here again

Went with my family for dinner. Unique concept that blends Asian and western food ideas. Good time Eating and sharing conversations with friend and family because there's no utensils , all we could do is to leave the phone aside as our hands got dipped with great food. Particularly love the northern curry with squids and also salty salty prawns

Crab In Da Bag is a Southern Louisiana and Asian influenced seafood that has anchored at Big Splash and we joined a group of friends to check out the unique dining concept the seafood restaurant has installed. Set in the Blue and White nautical theme, we settled down around a big square table that managed to accommodate our big group of 12 adults and 5 children.Browsing through the menu, we decided to go for the Caboodle Boil (Titanic Pot - $299 and Gigantic Pot - $399) plus other side dishes.Instead of the conventional table cloth, large pieces of clean mahjong-like paper teared from the gigantic roll was laid. Looking for aprons? Put on the bibs (uniquely designed by Crab in da Bag) to shield your pretty outfits. Not forgetting the scissors and tools that we will need to crack those hard shells later on.What's so special about dining at Crab In Da Bag? It's unique concept is getting your hands dirty! No cutlery or crockery is served. As you will be stuffing food into your mouth with your bare hands, make sure your hands are clean before you dine!As the name of the restaurant suggests, food (crabs, shellfish, noodles, rice etc) will be cooked and served in transparent bags mixed with different sauces. Serving staff brings the bag to our table, tied and toss it before helping us to open it.Whenever the bell rings and someone shouts "AHOY!", that means a Caboodle boil is ready! A serving staff carried a large metal bucket filled with seafood to our table. Within seconds,the metal bucket of lobsters, king crab legs, Sri Lankan crabs, yabbies, cray fish, squids, prawns, clams, sausages, potatoes, corn on the cob and lemons were tossed out on the table. Served with 3 different types of exotic dips (Malaysian Sambal Dip, Thai Green Bird Dip and Louisiana Garlic Butter Dip). Since I am not a fan of spice, the Garlic Butter Dip suits me best. However, I find all the 3 dips too oily for my liking. It feels like I am dipping food into oil and eating it. Give the lemons a good squeeze, sprinkle the juice on the pile of seafood and it's time to dig in! If you do not mind to share food, the communal dining concept adopted here will be uniquely fun. Aim for that crab leg or sausages and grab it with your bare hands. Here's some tips and considerations when you are dining at Crab In Da Bag: 1) Make reservations especially if you have a big group.2) Wear casual clothing that you don't mind getting dirty.3) Be ready to share the costs. :)4) Wash your hands before the meal.5) Ensure you have taken enough photos and keep it in your bag. (BEWARE: Your hands will get dirty)6) Most importantly, have FUN, enjoy the FOOD and COMPANY without the distractions from games and media tools.The total 'damage' at the end of our dinner came near to SGD 1k! (The Titanic Pot and Gigantic Pot costs more than SGD 700 plus.) Considering that we had a big group of 17 (with 5 children), each adult paid ~SGD 80. Is it worth it? It seems a little too pricey but considering the amount of seafood that we had, the unique experience and company help to make up for the costs.Fun experience but comes with a price. http://bpdgtravels.blogspot.sg/2014/04/crab-in-da-bag-uniquely-messy.htm

I actually love it even though am not a big fan of Crabs! But, there are other choices of seafood, indeed! Flavours are good! Well, crabs were served in a bag & brought to the table in a bucket. Table laid with paper, no cutleries, just tucked in with hands, fingers lickin' good! For ala carte order - pick your choice of seafood; add any side dishes + choice of 4 or 5 sauces + level of spiciness. Then, order some fried items - loved the fried mini crispy squids; fried fish fillets; and fried chicken wings! Well, they just need to improve on their services - the Male Manager did not smile at all till we leave the restaurant, but one of the spectacled smaller built male servers was very good - always smiling; very attentive!. Also, please put some signage on the main entrance for 1st time visitors! Other than that, fun experience indeed

I was at Crab in da Bag to celebrate my birthday. It's such an experience eating food off the table! It is especially fun when you have to search for that sausage or crab claw in a huge pile of mess, with your bare hands!If you are a seafood lover, you will enjoy the food. You get crabs, prawns, clams, lobsters when you order the Caboodle Boil (the one you see in my photos), with corn, sausages, potatoes all boiled together to retain the seafood's natural sweetness. It's a dish for everyone!You can also order fried stuff like squids, shrimps, wings, fries on the side or ala carte menus of seafood cooked in various sauces like curry, garlic butter. Best still, for rice buckets like me (饭桶), order a bowl of rice, mix it into the left-over sauces, and clean out everything leaving no trace behind! Yum.The lady captain of the restaurant, Capt A P Tan, is such a wonderful host, going from table to table, making sure to chat with the patrons, to ask if everything is ok. She will make it a point to find out why you're there...celebrating something? like birthday? Whose? Oh OK! Wait! What's your name? How do you spell that? And just like that, she'll send out a birthday 'cake' after your meal, on the house, with your name, right spelling and all, and have the entire place celebrate with you. Embarrassing much! But wow, memorable indeed.Thank you Crab in da Bag, for making my birthday so cool and interesting.Go try it! It'll be fun

We were invited to a birthday lunch at a restaurant called Crab in da Bag. Go past the Big Splash building along the East Coast Parkway and the Restaurant is easily visible. Many parking lots.The ambiance is pleasant with an attempt to create the feel of being in a boat house, with waitresses and waiters ( or cabin girls and boys as they are referred to ) calling out “Ahoy!” when you come past the main door. There’s a ship’s steering wheel at the entrance, fishing nets overhead, white wooden tables with a varied mix of different types of chairs. A well stocked bar with a few varieties of beers, spirits in miniature bottles, wines, bubbly Moscatos, Alcopops, etc.We had some fried sweet potato chips, deep fried chicken wings, french fries and some sweet crispy chewy fried baby squib as starters. This was followed by the Caboodle Boil, a Titanic pot containing 1 Boston Lobster, 2 Sri Lankan crabs, King crab legs, Yabbies, Tiger prawns, squibs, Venus clams, sausages, corn cob, potatoes, lemons, and onions. You first get a plastic napkin to wrap around the neck to protect your clothes. White paper is laid on the table, and the dish, when ready, is announced with a loud bell. The contents of the Pot are poured at the center of the table. For the dressings, there’s the Malaysian Sambal, Thai green bird and the Louisiana garlic butter dips. A small tissue box, special scissors and metal crackers to assist you to eat the crabs, the three dips in plastic containers, and you’re set! No plates, forks, knives and spoons! Yes, No cutlery! Use your fingers and hands and get messy! Empty shells, bottles and bones, and whatever, are just placed in front of you on the table! After the eating is over, the cabin boys and girls simply fold the paper up to clear everything on the table. All you need to do is to hold on to your drinks! There are three wash basins at the back to the left of the bar with liquid soap for you to wash your hands and a paper towel dispenser for drying hands. Looking at the prices on the menu, it’s not a cheap experience! But sea food is rarely cheap, especially if you get it this fresh! The Caboodle Boil Titanic pot alone, sufficient for 4 to 5 people, will set you back $299.00 not counting what other food items you may select additionally, plus drinks.Speaking of which, they have a unique way of serving the beer. This comes inside a model of the Eiffel Tower and four taps at the base of the Tower deliver cold beer on-tap into plastic cups! A great place for informal gatherings of family and friends. Depending upon your selection of seafood, it can be expensive. But the experience is worth it. There are also other dishes that you can select which are meant for individuals, couples or small group dining. Like the Pomfret in curry sauce, the prawn in a bag, etc. Kids have a special Kiddies Bag for $13.00. So this is a good reason to return for more sea food and messy fun!Address: Crab in da Bag902 East Coast Parkway,Block D Unit #01-25,Singapore 449874.Tel: +65 64400083Visit their web site at: crabindabag.com and you can see the food and drink menu, with prices. You’ll be tempted and hard pressed to go

Order your choice of seafood and the sauce, it will be served and bring to you in a plastic bag...hence the name crab in da bag. If you have a big group you can consider ordering the Titanic pot. First the waiter will lay a piece of paper on the table, and then he will bring a pot with the mixed steamed seafood and pour them onto the table. You will be given aprons so that you will not stained your clothes when you eat, special scissors to cut open the shell (don't try cracking with your teeth) and then dip the seafood in the sauces provided. A bit pricy I find, cos 1 titanic pot will set you pack $299! Which I think for that price you can get really good seafood from the seafood centre (jumbo etc) further down the east coast park. Do also order the crinkled cauliflower as a side dish! yummy but portion is rather small
