Slightly better than a food court but nothing special. Do not make a special trip here to eat. There are better choices in the food courts in the city.

To rate the Tiong Bahru Food Centre as a restaurant does the place an injustice.Yes, upstairs there are countless stalls, serving freshly cooked food, with some booths even having Michelin rating (not Michelin stars.) We ate well both times we have visited. And great value.But downstairs is a great fresh food (fish, meat, fruit, vegetables etc.) market plus home products, buzzing with activity, clean and easy to walk through. And some of the vendors are real characters, often so full of energy.You cannot visit one floor without visiting the other
5
Showcases some of the best Singapore local, economical Hawker food. Best time to visit: weekend mornings to feel the buzz n energyBest stalls: countless, just look for the queuesType of food: Chicken rice, noodle soup, duck rice, fried noodles, steamed flour cake with radish, barbecued pork..Tip: check out the florists on ground level. They sell interesting local n imported flowers - at reasonable prices Market is closed on Mon, most stalls are closed in the evenings
5
My favourite was the lormee. It is this bowl of noodles with a broth. The one I love is the one with shark nuggets. It was very savoury. Vinegar and Chilli are optional but I love them with my lormee. Finish it off with a Sugar Cane drink and your meal is complete. There are many other quality food like Duck Rice and Chwee Kueh, which is steamed rice cake with radish topping
5
We had two vegetable curries for $10, they were tasty and large portions, what a bargain.This hawker centre is large, clean, with choices for all palates. It was walking distance from our hotel and in the lovely Tiong Bahru district, full of trendy shops, bars and art deco architecture
5
Great Place to eat, get cheap cold beer, and fresh squeezed juices, you can go everyday for a week and not eat the same thing twice, great for budget traveler, or large group that can decide what to eat.I'm here on business, and eat here 4 to five times a week. A hidden gem in plane sight. And all the people are great, local spot for sure, one place is even Michelin Rated.

My wife and I spent several days in Singapore recently. During that time, we visited several of the hawker centres. Tiong Bahru was our favorite by a wide margin. Why? It's clean, has sufficient seating (big plus!), and has some of the best food in the city. The selection is wide and varied, and the stall owners generally were very friendly in spite of being rushed off of their feet. As usual, the stalls with the longest lines are likely to be the best, so get there early and you probably won't wait for more than 10 minutes per stall. We arrived at about 11:15 and managed to try 4 of the offerings. I have special praise for 2 of the stalls, Jian Bo Shui Kueh and Lee Hong Kee. It's astonishing that these folks can provide this delicious food for next to no money.Tiong Bahru is slightly out of the way, but well worth the effort. We took Singapore's excellent subway system to reach it. Just go
5
Eat where the locals eat and recommend!Everything looked and smelt incredible, it's almost overwhelming and makes it difficult to make a decision on what eat.My friends took charge on the food we ate, giving me a chance to sample a variety of of dishes on my last day in Singapore.Though I've been to other Hawker joints, this one really did have a huge variety of stalls. Food prices were not expensive here and the quality and quality was great.There are a lot of fans scattered around so it helped with the heat whilst eating
5
I was residing in a hotel near Tiong Bahru Food Centre and I got all my lunch and dinner there. There's so much selection of food that 1 week was not enough to taste all of them. The main dishes are traditional Singaporean, Korean, Cantonese, Thai and Malaysian food. My taste buds were so pleased to enjoy all these dishes. Moreover, food are cooked on the spot and served within 2 to 5 mins. The place is very clean and price is very affordable

Came here on the last day of 2017 with my mum for some new year shopping at the market shops below the food center. We were previously staying at Jalan Bukit Merah some 30 years ago. Even though we had moved to Choa Chu Kang ten years back, my mum still likes to frequent this place for her new year clothing.The food center at the upper floor has changed drastically in terms of design and is now enriched with more stalls selling a variety of local delicacies.Among the many hawker centers I visited this is one top best I have seen. It occupies the entire second floor wide, spacious and bright. The stalls are neatly arranged in a circular direction and at one look one can easily select the stall or food one likes. It is unlike most hawker centers I came across where the aisles are cramped and narrow for walking. There is much walking space at this hawker center and there are sufficient space for licensed buskers to perform at the lobby area.It is so wonderfully relaxing on a Sunday morning to hear lively music and songs being played and sang by one performing busker.The whole food center looks clean and neat. There are tray return stations for customers to return the utensils after eating. The cleaners are also efficiently fast to clear the leftover. Such an arrangement encouraged customers good habit of returning the tray and utensils after eating. Signboards are also displayed not to over ordered that may result in a waste of food.While my mum is having her Teochew fish porridge I decided to walk around to make a survey on which stalls were having long queue of customers.My survey result is as follows:(1) Tiong Bahru Lee Hong Kee Cantonese Roasted(2) Heng Heng Soup Republic(3) Min Nan Pork Ribs Prawn Noodle(4) Lor Mee 178(5) Tiong Bahru Fried Kway Teow(6) Tiong Bahru Hainanese boneless chicken rice(7) Kim Fa Fish Ball Minced Meat Noodle(8) Heng Heng Fried Sotong Prawn MeeI must qualify that I am not advertising or promoting for any of the stalls. This is just a random 5 minute unofficial walkabout observation on a Sunday morning. The results may not be the same on another day.I noticed that almost all of the above stalls have some decals post at their stalls where they were rated by agencies that award them as being the Best Top food stalls in Singapore. That reputation or achievement probably account for the long queue of customers.At one of the stalls, I also noticed that the stall holder encouraged cashless payment mode using QR code just like the Alipay in China. Great! Our hawkers are also catching up with the trend.Overall, Tiong Bahru Food Centre impresses me as being the top best hawker center among those I visited in terms of food range, cleanliness and comfort
5
This place brought almost all choices of food from all over the world. Prices are cheap, the area is clean, customers are disciplined to place their dishes and trays on specific area after eating. You can find.famous dishes in Singapore in this place.
4
This is the place to come for yummy and authentic local fare. There are many delicacy stalls here ranging from famous roast duck rice to a commoner’s coffee, desserts to soups. Easily accessible by taking bus number 16 and 123 from Orchard. Seats are hard and environment is humid but for true blue foodies, it is worth bearing. Good and delicious food aren’t necessarily from posh restaurants or hotels. Check it out and you shall be spoilt for choice
4
I stay at a hotel near Clark Quay. Board Bus 33 opposite of the Clark Quay Station and bring me to Tiong Bahru Food Court directly. Many varieties of food & drinks. Clean. Good Food. For return, walk to the opposite road of Tiong Bahru Food Court. Bus 33, 63, 851 will reach Clark Quay Station
5
As our hotel was not too far away we decided to go down and see what type of food there was and we were not disappointed! There are lots of little stalls all specialising in certain dishes and hardly any tourists (I love to find places like this while travelling). We had the best Gyoza ever from Joo Chiat Beef King (stall 35) and even went back a second time for more
5
This food centre is one of my fav place in Singapore. So many nice food stalls even for drinks (beer & fresh fruit juices) and desserts, very local and cheap also clean. I normally tried different food stalls every time I go there because the portion is quite small. Recommended to go if you are in the area
5
It's not like a tourist spot as much as others, but it's always a good experience to see deeper a country / city by seeing how locals live and how the heritage places are preserved by the government.Tiong Bahru Food Center is good for this. I only tried the local iced (kopi) coffee that the hotel manager recommended me. Although it has no air-con, I didn't find it hot under the huge ceiling fans in noon time.The ground floor is their local wet market where beautiful fresh flowers are also sold. Walking around the market is worthwhile too! The gov has built a garden among the historical residential buildings.The district is so quiet, peaceful, neat and tidy that I wanted to live there!
5
Tiong Bahru Market is a local icon boasting of a wide selection of local food in a clean and hygienic setting. Stalls to look out for: Tiong Bahru Hainanese Chicken Rice, Hong Heng Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles, Jian Bo Shui Kueh, Zhong Yu Yuan Wei Wanton Noodles, Teck Seng Soya Bean - when in doubt, look out for long queues in front of the stall to steer you in the right direction
5
Want great local food in a very clean and and friendly Hawkers the 1st floor is the food center, where there is so many varieties, lots of tables in front of the stalls so plenty of seating, or you can get your dishes to go. A must go to place for great local food, and at very good prices
5
While Tiong Bahru Food Center may not have the 'star' power of Maxwell Road Food Center (possibly due to Tian Tian and Anthony Bourdain), it is nonetheless one of the all time favorite hawker food centers among local Singaporeans for decades with arguably one of the best sampling of hawker food varieties under one roof. Many of the stalls have made a name for themselves simply by word of mouth over the years. They have been the perpetual subjects of many local food blogs. A few of these stalls have been honorably recognized by Michelin (Bib Gourmand). These stalls were renowned long before they were discovered by Michelin. IMHO THE best chwee kueh (水粿) stall - Jian Bo Shui Kueh has been a resident here since the beginning. Others stalls to try are: Hui Ji Fishball Noodles and Yong Tau Foo, Teochew Fish Soup, Ru Yi Vegetarian Stall (superb vegetarian bee hoon!), Lor Mee 178, Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee, Zhong Yu Yuan Wei Wanton Noodles - just to name a few. I am getting hungry just mentioning these stalls
4
The ground floor houses the wet and dry market and the first floor is the food centre. The stalls, good guess at 70 to 80, are all lined up along the perimeter of the building and facing in, while the dining area spread out in front of these stalls right up to the middle.The environment is clean and orderly and you could find most of the local Chinese favourite dishes here. I observed that there were just a small handful of stalls selling non-Chinese food. Whatever it is, this is a food court offering generally ok fare and is highly recommended
5
Tons of good food there. My fav is the pork rib prawn mee, Hokkien noodles, chicken rice, BBQ pork rice, shark meat noodles, fishballs.
Only issue is sun nights have little food. Most stores will be closed.
4
We like the foods here.
The price here consider cheapest compared to maxwell food centre ,lao pa sat and other food courts.
5
Great place if you desire local hawker food. Great variety of local favourites, clean and cheap. Good BBQ meat stall, Hainan Chicken rice, Chwee Kueh (steamed rice cake with toppings)
5
Always one of my favorite stop when in Singapore, as there is so much variety : from chicken rice, popiah, to delicious duck, bakuteh and more!
I also love to stop there for a fruit juice or coconut post run.
5
This is one of the most popular hawker centres of Singapore. Almost of the stalls are run by Singaporeans past down by older generation. It is recently renovated and with more fans installed, it is more airy now.
4
Give this place a go for good quality food at great cheap prices. Plenty of stalls to choose from, and has a good local feel about it.
4
Worth visiting to sample local food. Many famous food stalls there but can get quite busy during lunch time. Try the chwee kueh. It's famous
5
I love coming to this place. So much variety in food. It's local food at it's best. There are so many to choose from and very affordable. Hawker food is the way to go if you want the real deal. Fancy restaurants are good in Singapore but when I go to different cities, I try my best to immerse myself with the local fare rather than have western food. Local dining is always part of the experience and as well as my travels. You can't beat the food here so try it and you will enjoy it. Don't forget to check the markets downstairs too
5
I used to stay very near to Tiong Bahru Mkt. The revamped market is cosy, clean and airy.These are some of the stalls that need to Queue. I like to go odd hours eg 2pm-3pm to get all these food without queuing1) Escalator right: Chicken rice2) Escalator right: Lor Mee3) Escalator left: Hokkien Mee4) Escalator left: Chwee Kueh5) Escalator left: Char Kwah tiaoMany more, love the vegetarian food, yong tau fu (which also sells fishball noodles)Actually about 35%-40% of the stall need to queue. Ie: good food, worth going. CHeap to
5
touched down in SG and was looking to get my chicken rice fill on. A quick search told me this was the place to go, after hopping into a cab, it was confirmed that this was the place to go. Arrived, and ordered a bunch of dishes- a roasted chicken rice, lemon chicken, some veggies, and a diet coke. All in, i paid around 13 SGD- and it was probably one of the best meals i've had
4
This has by far the best indian food I have had outside India. Very authentic taste and very friendly staff. The location is superb.
Would visit again
4
Review by Dr Sim. Good variety of food. Quality of food depends on what you choose. Good for tourists to visit if you have the time. Try the Lor Mee with the longest queue. No service. Self service. No air-conditioning. Regards Dr Sim
5
better environment. Not so warm like it used to be. Still have lotsa good food there and always children friendly. We can order a lot at a go but still can low cost! The only down point is the lack of parking spaces!
4
Big, airy, usual choices, closes early, recent renovations and fresh coat of paint. And unusually large fans. Nothing else to report really; one of the nicer hawker centres. So I'll stick with the fans.They must have a 4 metre diameter. It is hard to imagine the blades fitted to a Boeing model anything. TB Hawker Centre may be SG's first wind farm. There are whispers that their addition is a covert move by the government to gain TB Hawker Centre the coverted title of First Hawker Centre on The Moon. Working closely with NASA and Tesla, it took the National Service in the millions of man hours to build each complete unit, and hooe lies in their exhaust capabilities to turn back global warming. Big if true. Big for sure
3
Visited this hawker centre for the first time on the weekend. In the late afternoon on a Sunday most of the stalls were closed but I managed to find a decent coconut for less than $3 still. One of the cleanest hawker centres I've seen in Singapore. Might be worth a visit during a busy time
5
My husband and I recently stayed in Singapore and were a short walk to the food center from our hotel. We went every day for lunch, and once later in the day. I strongly recommend going during the lunch rush, as all of the food will be fresh and piping hot. It is worth the wait in line to get such an awesome assortment of foods. We tried at least 10 different dishes, as well as some delicious iced coffee. The laksa was so tasty and aromatic, with a smoky flavor. The meats (chicken and duck) with rice were very good, as well. The chwee kueh (prepared by the Michelin-star vendor) was unlike any food I have ever tried before- delicious and unique. Very hearty meals for both of us at a very cheap price, especially in Singapore. We were laughing at the end of our trip, as we had only spent half of the money that we had exchanged
5
A fantastic place to get some grub. The bottom level is mainly grocery shopping - different stalls selling all sorts of goodies, fruit, fish, poultry, meats, flowers, plants etc.The 2nd story is where the hawker food stalls operate. So many yummy places to eat. We got a cup of Singaporean style coffee with browned butter and a spoonful of condensed milk as well as pork noodles and some mangosteen from downstairs. Fabulous. So many friendly customers and vendors to chat with. We made a few friends gave us advice on places to visit on our 21 hr layover! I think we paid $1 for coffee and $6 for noodles. Pretty cheap for Singapore standards
3
Great local dishes like vegetarian beehoon, fried carrot cakes, 'toutsuan', chweekway and chicken rices etc., come at truly reasonable price for more than half a century in this vintage neighbourhood just outside the CBD in Singapore.Surprisingly, very little seems to have been enhanced to the dimly lit L2 food court after 9am when all the led lights are automatically shut down rain or shine ! Ironically, the 3 months long renovations of late have made the toilets better lit than the twilight food area !Due to apparent lack of manpower, the tables and benches are not much cleaner than before and food remains are not promptly and properly wiped clean.
5
Very interesting local place, not only for food but you can also see how people here work and eat. We came here at least 4 times to taste different kinds of noodles and duck/chicken. One stall for roasted duck seems to be very famous with long queue of people buying for carrying home. Nice view to the big garden on ground floor.
4
Put this on our list of must see before we started our trip, having read about one of the hawker stands having a Michelin star award. We had the Hainanese boneless Chicken And Rice which was very good (at $4.00) and freshly crushed sugar cane juice with lime and it was great (at $1.30
4
Came for lunch, very cheap, friendly and lots of choice. Options for vegetarians too. Will probably be back for dinner as well since there is a good hainanese chicken places with rather long queues at both
5
Of the hawkers we visited in Singapore this was the best! There must've been 100+ stalls, and the complex felt very clean and was buzzing on a Saturday morning. We had already eaten so only had a juice (which was lovely!) but plenty of choice!
4
This was close to where we were staying. Excellent value for the family and lots of options for the whole family. We were a bit late getting there so some places had closed but still had some good food.
4
It's a must visit!! There were so many choices and the prices are really cheap! The wet market downstairs is also very interesting
4
This area is a must. A touch of the past well preserved. The food was excellent. We were introduced to carrot cake. Not what we expected but tasty and full of flavours. Lime drink resting. An enjoyable lunch.
4
We loved the food centre. Very clean with lots of fans and welcoming locals. Behind the good centre are the Art Deco streets of old Singspore. We had a relaxing walk around and enjoyed the open air cafes which reminded us a little of Parisian streets.
5
The building blends in perfectly with classic architecture from Singapore's earlier days. Much of the surrounding quarter is 1920/30s Bauhaus style whitewashed concrete building. Very well renovated and preserved. The food center is smiliar to many other such places in S'pore. My food recommendation goes to Fried Kway Teow - hearty soul food (if that exists in Chinese)
4
The Cantonese BBQ duck and chicken was delightful and cooked well. The food hall style Eatery with many outlets it's a pleasure to walk around and smell the local and international foods from Asia. We ate at one of the higher priced stalls which had won many awards in previous years for the best food in Singapore we could not doubt after eating they deserve every award
4
Decided to give it a try and were pleased with our decision. It is a food market with plenty of choices of very low priced meals. We had 3 plates for a low cost of $13.50. The food was not the best we have had in Singapore, but there was plenty to satisfy our appetites, it was fresh and tasted good. Service could have been a bit better and more friendlier, but cooking in the small outlets with the heat and humidity, cannot blame them for not being more friendlier. Overall, a good meal at excellent prices, certainly got value for our money here
4
Walked over here from our hotel ( Nostalgia). Ate some chicken rice -very good.Drank a few beers -nice and cold with a glass of ice. Returned later in the evening for an oyster omelet. Quite a varied selection of local foods at very reasonable prices. The food court area is reasonably clean and organized ,once you get the hang of "serve yourself". Seemed a bit tidier than Chinatown and the food was every bit as good or better
4
If you want to eat tasty food and dont want to pay much money, so i recomend this place. There you can eat different kinds of authentic dishes
4
The hawker center was recently renovated with better seating arrangements and with those jumbo ceiling fans. More airy than previously. Good thing all the great stalls are still there.
5
Huge selection of local food at great prices. Great market on the lower floor too.
Check out the neighbourhood as well.
4
You must try this once during your stay in Singapore. Dozens of competing food vendors selling just about every thing. It is easy to eat for less than $10 and enjoy a real atmosphere buzz, especially in the evenings
5
This food centre contains two of my favourite food spots: Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice for chicken rice and Yue Hao for lime juice. Combined, they create a delicious meal for under six dollars! Plenty of seating, all bolted down and spaced apart well for walking
5
was taken here by a friend during my stay and loved it - between three of us we sampled about 7 different things from about 4 stallsmuch more variety than the other food courts id been too and much much cheaper told by my local friends that the range of dishes here is also more what the everyday singaporean eats well worth a visi
5
As this is located just above Tiong Bahru Market, this food centre serves food from the early hours till late afternoon. Some stalls are open at night too. Huge selection of food under one roof, all rather good with great prices to match. It took me a few visits to go some of my favorites. A must try
4
Reopened after 3 month renovation, its cleaner now and Added more fans . Hawker foodcourt is upstairs while the wet market is at ground floor. This is a one stop for many things: food (many local food with affordable prices), florists, you can buy vegetable, poultry/meat/fish , fruits and all cooking ingredients and even can find some fashion shops around.
4
Reopened after the renovation , the center looks great. It has been the busiest I've ever seen it for lunch on a Sunday. It took us 5 min to find a table. Other than that the traditional vendors are all back on, with some displaying a small sign showing " best food in Singapore 2017". You can follow the sign or just go with the long lines. The prices seemed to be unchanged, even after the big upgrade. Normally I would recommend a dish in a restaurant, but at Tiong Bahru, I found it best to try new dishes and enjoy the variety. Definitely a worth while visit for any visitors to Singapore. Enjoy
5
Hokkien mee, chwee kueh and lor mee very popular here. For good reasons too!!! Hokkien mee is my favourite anyway and this is one of the best places to come and get it. Chwee kueh too but in my opinon the Bedok one is just as good. So Hokkien mee gets my vote here! Ample seating, market downstairs too so ideal shop/eat spot
4
4 people ordered 4 different meals and all were pretty good. great location and vibe of the food hall and worth a visit if your wandering aimlessly soaking up the Tiong Bahru atmosphere.
3
this venue is only 2 minutes walk from our hotel accommodation nostalgia hotel. the food is very very cheap. and they make really refreshing sugar cane juice.On a hot day it really makes a difference.
3
We wanted to eat at a food center, typical of Singapore. We had references of some bibs gourmand and we ended up choosing this one because it seems the least touristy. We ate the mee and the chicken that were recommended, are reasonable. What I really liked was the sugar cane juice squeezed to order
5
This was recommended by our hotel as where the locals eat and it was fantastic and super cheap too. Very basic but cutlery to be had unlike some hawker centres. There was so much to choose from so we opted on advice from the lady selling drinks and were not disappointed . Great selection of Chinese foods and veg, so tasty. Next time we tried the Indian and had Mee Goring as spicy as you like, loved it. Although there are a few sinks to wash hands we took wet wipes and tissues. Not to be missed!
5
Wanting to visit a typical Hawker Market while in Singapore and didn't know where to begin . . . . I read a lot of articles and asked a lot of people, but in the end, we had a guide who took us along to the Tiong Bahru Market - away from the tourist fray. We entrusted him with $20 and the goal of just helping us sample some local favorites. Our only request was not to watch the heat/spice level for our American stomachs to survive!It was amazing. We had rice, noddles, pork, chicken, eggplant, soup, and more - all delicious. I tried hard to pronounce the names of all the dishes. And, he returned $8. Incredible. He told us the government is regulating these markets now and they do have sanitary ratings. Stick to the "A"s
4
This is one place that I will always visit with my family for wide variety of food choices available in there. Wanton Mee, chicken rice, oyster omelette, etc. You name it, all the Singapore heritage Hawkers food are found here. But of course you must k now which stall serve the best, it takes time to hunt and tria
5
We took advice and went to the stall with the longest queue. The fish ball noodles were delicious and well worth the wait. Followed it with a cup of Kopi. This market is an easy 10 minute walk or one stop bus ride from the local MRT station
5
I like to come here for breakfast and buy flowers on Saturday. There are many famous hawker food in Tiong Bahru market like the wonton mee, Lor mee , Chwee kueh and fish ball noodles. There's an Uncle performing on sat too and that provide some kind of entertainment whilst dining.
4
The place is loaded with aisles of restaurants , all local food .Lots of CHIU chow authentic food , such as oyster omelette , the dim sum stuff with sticky rice or green bean .You can easily spend a couple of hours and leave without feeling hungry
5
Go hungry! This is a wonderful food court upstairs and flower market and food market downstairs.When you go upstairs, follow the longest lines and simply get what everybody else is getting. You may not know what they're serving there but I promise you, the long line will be a good indication that there is great food there.Eat small amounts so you can sample some of the other stalls.This place was one of the highlights of my trip. It was not far from my hotel and I enjoyed the people watching and the exceptional ethnic foods at the different stalls. Go here
4
Brilliant range of street food - take time to check all the stalls out first. Great tourist experience!
4
When it comes to Singapore this place is definitely bang for buck. Great food choices. Just look for those places with a big line
4
Very cheap food court with a good variety of quality food, but don't expect any sort of comfort. I've never had to queue for more than a couple of minutes.
4
Tiong Bahru Food Centre is about 20mins walk from the nearest MRT station. It's actually a 15 mins cab ride from Orchard Road, so you may want to make a trip here to experience authentic hawker fare and atmosphere. There's a wide variety of local food ranging from chicken rice, hokkien prawn noodles, prawn noodles soup, famous Tiong Bahru Bao and Fishballs, Lor Mee, etc. The selection is quite extensive for Chinese food though very limited selections for Malay and Indian cuisines. The place can get crowded during lunch time so do get there early (before 11.30am on weekdays) if you want to beat the queues. Most of the stalls do not open for dinner, so lunch is your best bet. Be prepared for the heat though as there is no air conditioned.
5
I read about 1 extremely negative review for RU YI vegetarian food stall. But I was pleasantly surprised of the great service at RU YI. Cheap veg food - bee hoon and veggies and mock meat - served with a smile. And the tea is excellent at all the tea stalls
4
Hello, I guess I would now be classesd as a seasoned traveller having been from Australia to many Asian places and countries recently.We last night went to Lau Pa Sat and food was average, quite nice but again mostly about the traveller experience dining on the street in middle of city but found experience overall intrusive and actually felt tired on the food we ate, although reasonable.Today we came for Tiong Bahru Markets upstairs and was blown away by the authenticity and relaxed atmosphere of the place.The food was remarkably good and so cheap but the thing I liked so much was it's a traditional Singaporean market with mainly locals providing service to fellow Singaporean's so as a big white boy Aussie I stood out like dog's balls..Very few tourists or out of Towner's which gave me the true Singapore experience without the tourist pressure!!!!!Absolutely a must to do unless you overly precious about your food
4
This is supposed to be one of the best (top 5) hawker centres in Singapore as there is plenty of choice. However on a Thursday evening only a handful of shops were open and we tried sliced fish noodles. kway teoh, oyster omelette and sugarcane juice. All pretty good and the best part is that the place is pretty CLEAN!Do yourself a favour and do some research before coming here as there are a few stalls that are "famous" for their fare.Can't really go wrong here and if you are here in the morning, you can even browse the fresh produce and dry goods
5
Really cheap food need not be poor quality. Rock up here with a pocket full of coins and you'll get yourself a meal that you'll be telling your friends about. Sure, it isn't somewhere you'd take people to be impressed with the furnishings, or the kind of place you take a business client to impress them. But if you want a great look at Singapore culture and food... get your butt over to here
4
Great place not far from Chinatown and Outram Park. Much bigger with more variety than Maxwell Road Hawker Center. Food is superb and there is a lot of room to enjoy it. I googled best dishes in Tiong Baru Food Centre and many reviews came up with photos and descriptions of the dishes and the best stalls to find them. Prices are good and we just got one dish at a time to sample and then moved on to the next one. Great strategy if you are not in a rush. Highly recommended
4
Tucked away on the edges of Chinatown, in the increasingly trendy area between Outram and Bukit Merah, this expansive centre looks rather non-descript from the outside. Food outlets are on the second floor, up a flight of escalators. There are numerous 'renown' outlets offering a variety of foods. Seating is ample, with lazily circulating overhead fans. It is quite hot and stuffy regardless, so come dressed to stay cool. Be aware many stalls also close on Monday. Some stalls have long queues. There are self-return tray areas, for when you have decided to call it a culinary day
4
Must try: Tiong Bahru friend kway teow, tow kwar pop, friend oyster at 02-61, Lor mee 178, Kampong carrot cake
4
Lots of cheap local food stalls. Stalls and seating kept clean. Lots of stalls for fresh vegetables and meat downstairs.
No air conditioning (only a couple of ceiling fans) so can get quite hot.
3
Long snaking queues that's all you get on week end.
Food so so, only few recognizable original stores - lor mee, chui kweh, pau.
Ventilation is poor, so very hot.
Avoid going on weekends.
4
Went with the family for brunch and was impressed with the variety of food with good taste. Prices are very affordable as it's a hawker centre. Place is clean and spacious.There are a lot of seats so no need to rush over seating places. There are stalls that have served the locals for many years already and true to this is deliciousness of the food served. I had "kampong fried carrot cake" and beef noodles. My family had the roasted pork and chicken riceHighly recommended. Happy eatin
4
Escalator is erected for easy access to the food centre. An overhead carpark is erected on top of the food centre for easy parking to solve the parking problem.Koh Bros. Is one of the old stall that serve pig offals clear soup with mustard leaves. It is the teochew ethnic group of the Chinese race. It is to be dipped into vinegared chilli and the old folks would eat the glutinous rice inserted into the large intestine skin, a taste you need to acquire and to be dip into sweet sauce and chili.The infamous Shiu Kueh stall has UP its price to $2 for 3 pieces of steam floured round dough topped with sauteed garlic and salty chay poh to be dipped in dried prawn chilli. I ate to my delight of 4 boxes for the last time as they are making us pay for their rent when the ingredients are not expensive .... wont you lower the price for your faithful following? The peranakan (mixed marriages of local Malay and official Chinese descent from China) Harrianns stall of nonya kueh are selling it at $1 a piece which is expensive. I only like the kaya (coconut milk with sugar and egg) top on glutinuous colored rice and the coloured layered rice flour mixed with thin coconut milk and sugar was good. The Ang ku kueh and steam tapioca with brown sugar coconut were mediocre.Tiong bahru fishballs were sold for 4 for $1 which are pricey.Most items have reduced and prices Up.Have rent gone up in such global economic gloom? .....it really spoil my eating spree.

This market has it all. A good fresh food market below and hawker center upstairs. You can buy fruit and veg, spices, coffee, flowers, kitchen ware etc in the market on the ground floor before heading up to the open sided food center on the first floor.Around maybe 80 stalls serve a wide variety of food. A very famous Fried Fish Soup stall has a huge crowd every day and I have joined the queue to try it. The stalls serve the regular hawker style food but the stand out feature of this market is its lay out. Plenty of space, breezy and and nice tables kept very clean. You won't see many tourists here but plenty of office workers come in for lunch.It also hasa very groovy website. Check it out

So many food stalls to choose from - we visited twice just to try a few different ones. Delicious and authentic Singaporean dishes - we had dumplings, noodles and laksa that was simply magnficient - my laksa was $3! Lots of locals here too which is a good sign. We skipped the fancy hotel breakfasts and headed here - best decision ever
5
The market downstairs is already a wonderful place to stroll along, with all sorts of shops filled to overflowing. A real taste of how Singapore has been for years. Then when you've finished shopping you wander upstairs to the food centre. A really good mix of all sorts of food, so you have a really great choice. Place is less touristy than a lot of other food centers and as is usual, just look for the longest que and you know the food is good. Singaporeans really don't accept average or poor from their food. Had the best Rojak ever here. Really fresh and tasty. Also a kueh stand with a really good assortiment, which is not easy to find anymore
5
This is now a very trendy area of Art Deco buildings. Great coffee and bakeries abound but we have bigger things in mind! You need to cross the road from the European looking coffee shops. Wander through the wet market downstairs first and then upstairs to queue up for some delicious soy chicken and noodles at the hawker centre. The chicken is like silk and so delicious! Just follow everyone else, they are in the know. We went for breakfast and there were already lines!

We decided to head out here to try our first hawker center food and we are glad we did. This neighborhood has a great vibe with friendly people working hard to make sure that affordable, good food is still available in this traditional Singapore hawker center venue. I had a seafood soup: a clear but flavorful broth featuring bits of random seafood like squid, shark, shrimp and some other fish. On the side I had some rice and of course a few chopped bird peppers and some other brown sauce condiment stuff that I had no idea what it was, but somehow it added to the flavors. A very sweet and kindly auntie helped me to place my order. She explained she was 78 years old and didn't know a lot of English, but she wanted to talk to me anyway. She really made me feel welcome. My seafood soup with rice was only $6.50 SGD.My partner had the Lemon Chicken Rice for only $3.00. He was sooo happy that it was truly boneless. It is the first place we've eaten in Singapore (and we've been here almost 6 months) that did not have any bits of chicken bone in it. Very nice! Of course we had to get dessert too. Tian Tian Dessert Heaven is really good for their fruit ice desserts. It's shaved ice with a fruit ice cream on top. We had ours with mango and then it had fresh passion fruit pulp over that. Really perfect to enjoy after my extra spicy seafood soup! Later we got fruit drinks: $1.50 for my watermelon drink and $2.20 for a banana drink. Both were good, but the banana one was made with slightly green bananas, so if you are looking for super sweet this would not be it. Still...everything was good and we were happy.Some tips: Wear comfy clothing that is good in the heat (think cotton/linen). It's outdoor dining, remember. Wear comfy shoes in case you are going to have to queue up to wait for a special meal at a favorite stand. Bring a packet of tissues, the small pocket pack, and set it on the table you're planning to use after you get done with your line. It is a friendly way to say "this spot is taken." Bring your own wet wipes and/or napkins. They do have hand washing stations in a couple spots, right there and easily accessible. With prices so low, you'll want to try many different foods. Bring small change - yes, Singapore money - like your $1 coins, your 20 cent and 50 cent pieces, etc. as well as small bills like $2, $5 and $10. This will make it much easier for you and for the hawker center workers. This center is open basically daylight hours only, with many stalls closing early if they run out of food or whatever. We went on a Saturday afternoon at around 2 p.m. and the place was really empty with few lines. Several shops had already closed for the day. It was quiet. Seems like a thing here in Singapore, though - around 2-3 p.m. everyday a lot of things seem to slow down. So decide whether you like the hustle-bustle and fun people watching of busier lunch time crowds or you prefer a more calm experience and then head out to Tiong Bahru Plaza, 2nd floor hawker center. There is some street parking, or there is a parking garage nearby. Oh! I almost forgot - the market on the bottom part of the center is also lots of fun. Go there for beautiful fresh flowers that are easy on the budget

Interesting plce to visit but not so amazing. There a lot of food shops and IT is an interesting experience if you want to taste local specialities. The Prices are cheap.
5
Good food, cheap, no frills, good people in stalls. Sugarcane juice is great. Some of the stalls are very old, like from 1950s.
4
This food centre has a variety of food to choose from. The price is reasonable and the stall owners friendly.
3
Place to have sandwich, lots of noodles and Indian stalls. Depends on your taste and willingness to try out different things.
3
I am unable to explain it but this must be the saddest food court on the island. It could certainly be cleaner. A very few restaurants serve excellent food but they are really in the minority like the Malay store where they are definitely friendlier. The write up of this heritage quarter somehow misses this part of the atmosphere
5
If you are only going to visit one hawker center in Singapore, then you should visit Tiong Bahru food centre. It is more airy, spacious and cleaner than other famous food centres like Maxwell. There are 2 Michelin Bib Gourmand establishments here: Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless chicken rice and Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn mee. I think Singapore is the only country in the world where you can find such good food at such cheap prices, and in a clean and comfortable environment.Near the food center you can also get very good coffee at Forty Hands, and Plain Vanilla bakery nearby serves one of the best cupcakes in Singapore
3
Visit the Tiong Bahru Food Center on a Saturday morning for brunch. There are a lot options. We took the lor mee (noodles with thick gravy sauce and fresh chopped onions), roasted pork with rice, some kwee (small sticky rice delitacessen), and teh tarik (milked tea). It is all standard. Not extra ordinary. However the ambience is nice, pretty much Singaporean style of week ends
5
What an experience. The place to go to eat local food that the locals eat at. A local taxi driver told us about this place. Down stairs is fresh meat, fish, fruit, vegies, clothes, chemist, etc. The place was very clean. Upstairs is the food hall . I have never seen so many different Asian food stalls in the same place. A very good and unusual combination of food. Prices are very cheap compared to the restaurants. Price starting from $ 3 sing, local beer, $3 for a 600ml bottle. Very good if you like local food. If you like fine dining, stick to the restaurants. Very clean and tidy. A must to go to
5
The Tiong Bahru Market has just recently been renovated and is now called to be the cleanest and spacioust center of Singapore. A modern exhaust system provides the center with a pleasant climate. Furthermore, the center is located right above Tiong Bahru Wet Market, the cityâ€™s most popular fresh market. This way, you can combine the experience of a wet market with a delicious meal.The signature dish of the center is Chwee Kueh at Jian Bo Chwee Kue
5
The cha siu there is really good. I can't imagine how they can keep the meat in the chat siu white and not dark like those found in other places. The noodle is very springy too. We also like the Chwee kuay there and not forgetting the famous tiong bahru fish ball . This place has just too many nice hawker food!!
4
I really love wet markets and hawker centres, watching people in their every day lives and Tiong bahru market was an interesting place to visit. Especially loved the stalls sending flowers. The food in the hawker centre was cheap and tasty. Worth a visit!
5
These 2 dishes were here forever!!! And the taste and serving hardly changed. No amount of queueing dithers the craver!!!😜😜
4
Chicken was smooth and succulent. At $4 - there is also bean sprout, Choy sum , a bowl of chicken soup and of course the fragrant chicken rice. Value for money - great satisfaction in this meal.
5
This is a hawker centre so there are many individual food stalls. The area is famous for its history of mid 20th-century architecture and the food often is from the same period with many old favourites available. The "Char Way Teow" and "Rice Cakes aka Chwee Keuh" are great. After eating the food walk around the streets within a few blocks of the food centre. you will enjoy the experience of walking back in time
5
For local Hawker food. Famous for porridge, Lor mee, gui kueh, prawn noddles, hand made Bao, curry rice, char Juay Teow, Teochew fish soup n porridge, and desserts - hot n cold. A local haunt for many especially on weekends and meal times during weekdays. A must visit. Parking limited though. Strongly recommended. There is also a wet market from Tuesday to Sunday on the ground floor- reason why it is always crowded.
3
The market was refurnished some years back. After which most of the older generation stores were gone, including the lor mee store. The revamped food centre is triangular and it requires one to walk a big round. Back to food, the chwee kueh store is still around. 20 pieces with sauces separately packed is now $8.30. The beef hor fun store still whips up tasty hor fun. The tau kau pok store continues to have long queues. Oh not forgetting the vegetarian bee hoon, the nonya kueh, the ang ku kueh, and a couple of Cantonese roast meat stores. The price is still reasonable for a much cleaner environment. You probably can still get a bowl of noodles for $3
5
Stall 02-64One of the few stalls left that still sells traditionally made 'zhai kueh' with more than 50 years of experience! Fillings include chives (best), bangkuang (unique), cabbage, kailan, zhai sim, glutinous rice, taro, green bean paste (salty/sweet), peanut. A definite must try for a nostalgic experience
5
Not only is the Tiong Bahru Food Centre like an amusement park for a foodie, but it's one of the best ways to not let this city break your wallet. Singapore is a beautiful and clean city, but it comes with a price tag that left me a little unsettled. It's in every traveler's best interest to frequent hawker stalls as much as possible. Not only is it cheap, but you can experience the wonderful melting pot of cuisine that makes Singapore special. I'm pretty sure I've eaten at 70% of the stalls, and with each meal we tried at least 4 or 5 dishes. The portions are small but at a few dollars each, it's really easy to try many dishes at one sitting. I do recommend going early because it can get very hot and humid, as well as very busy, so be prepared to queue up and sweat
3
Over here in Tiong Bahru food market, other than the Chwee Kwek Yiu can't miss, is none other than the Wanton noodle. Once again, I have to warn you, Long queue is inevitable but the stall definitely worth the queue. If you are a big eater, order more instead of you have to queue again to buy some more
5
~getting to Tiong Bahru Food Centre earlier than 7.30am will guarantee a URA parking lot conveniently outside, before 8am drive carefully up the food centre carpark... there's a nasty entry to the rooptop big cars driving by shorter folks like me will have trouble seeing ahead because of the incline~everyone reviewing food galore is absolutely right~today was no different, I went to 3 stalls to gather foodiesStarted with Jian Bo Shi Kueh, those amazing rice cakes melt in your mouth with savory sesame seed pickled chye poh eat while still HOT Super Kicker02-56 Tiong Bahru Nasi Lemak I got a pack of fried thick yellow noodles (bitter) with otah (BBQ chili maceral paste), fried sotong slices (squid), luncheon meat (minced ham like spam) & chicken nugget YOMGYumz02-59 Hum Cheem Peng & Butterfly Fritters both made of dough are a savory & sweet pair of dessert YumzI keep going back for more THUMBS UP HIG
5
Loved this food centre! Great selection of places to eat, and the downstairs has beautiful flowers for sale. This centre was so clean and wonderful to walk around!
5
Great hawker centre with lots of great shops - look around for the shop with the longest queue to bag yourself a treat for a bargin price.
4
Must try. Though it's warm and humid, it's worth the effort. Queues are Long on weekends morning. Try 1-2pm but some stalls might be closed. Good luck!
5
Really a must do when in the neighbourhood. Take the escalator up to the food court area. Lots of choice. Best just queue up where you see a big queue and let yourself be surprised. Eat like a king for under SGD 10.
5
Conveniently located not far from the MRT station, not far from the CBD.
The food court is on the 2nd floor, above the market. Many food stalls, and many tables (not too difficult to get seats).
Good Singaporean food!
Affordable; about $5/person (meal+drink)
3
A local friend brought me to have lunch here. I had a laksa and a Hainan Chicken rice. I don't remember much of the food, so i am guessing is not extraordinary. There are a few places that people were lining up to, and are obviously famous. I am not a fan of lines, so no matter how famous, those are not for me. I rather liked the rest of the market. The area that they sell flowers were colourful and great to just look at. There are shops selling very daily things for locals, which is a good glimpse of life in Singapore
4
This food/hawker centre is a must if you want local food.We had many meals here, especially breakfast, and the food was fantastic every time.Can be very busy on the week ends with long queue's, but don't let this put you off as the wait is worth it
4
Hawker centre experiences in Singapore is a must-try if you are a first time visitor to Singapore. The Tiong Bahru Food Centre gives one the opportunity to try as many different type of food as possible in one place. I had the savoury puffs ( locally known as kueh ) at the TeoChew kueh stall, vegetarian vermicelli, fried fish cake, fried carrot cake along with soya bean milk. Prices are affordable plus the place is clean. It is my favourite hawker centre in Singapore! Come in the mornings to get a feel for the place
5
Amidst the heat and humidity of this place. The amount of stores selling a wide array of local food delights is astounding. The no of different combinations even within a different food store is many.All the vendors here are state licensed, frequently spot inspected by Singapore Government food inspectors (similar to the US ones) and given a grading. Even Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern has been to places like this all over Singapore. Laksa, Braised Beef noodles, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Ice Katchang, Mince pork noodles, Muslim foods and dozens on dozens of the best Singapore foods are here. You can expect great food here as the competition here is strong and the no of people lining up is a great indicator of the store's strengths. If you are not good within a period of time you are out... that is how cut throat the food biz are in Singapore especially there are 100s of substitutes and there is no place for poor quality food. The best food all over Singapore have move around, no longer lets say Katong Laksa sells only within Katong area now.... although possibly some food vendors might use the locality name to its advantage to fleece customers. Nonetheless, people are able to identify great from mediocre and would not last long in the food business. Go around once and then identify what you like and let the rush begins. As your friends or coworkers to each get a dish and then regroup to a sitting location! Awesome place for trying different dishes
5
Went there several times and it remains on top my hawker centre list. I would say the easiest way to get there would be taxi. Go to Tiong Bahru station, and look for the taxi stand. It took us around 10 minutes to get to the centre. Don't leave without trying their sugarcane drink and chicken rice!
5
Eat cheap and eat well at this food center. Lots of local favourites plus shop for fresh produce in the morning. Nice part of town too.
3
There are many other hawker food centres that offer much better food standard than Tiong Bahru. Chwee Kuey was the only one that was good, the rest of the food was ok only.
5
Food centre has the lot, great food, excellent service and polite locals who welcome one and all. We walked around the streets and marvelled at the old buildings that are great. A cab hear is easy
5
We have been here a few times in our 4 day trip in Singapore and have had wonderful food each time.It isn't very touristy which is great (unlike Lao Pak in the CBD), and has a great selection of food, around 80 stalls.There is a fantastic juice bar that you must try!I would definitely recommend a visit (or a few more) when in Singapore
5
This market is in a very nice neighbourhood, it's clean and spacious, and has a welcoming layout. There's an excellent variety of stalls offering mainly Chinese and Singaporean/Malaysian food at great prices. It's not overrun with tourists like Maxwell Food Centre, or staffed by teenagers like Lau Pa Sat. It's definitely my pick of the seven Singapore markets/food courts I visited
5
We arrived at 1:30pm for lunch and a number of dishes had already sold out and some shops were shutting up, so get there early. Mostly oriental food but we also had freshly made paratha and vegetarian Indian curry made with tvp from a popular Indian store. Not many tourists here
3
Good place to get an authentic local experience. A wide variety of local delights in an old but hippy Neighbourhood. Love the retro feel with the food centre being surrounded by lots of hip cafes. I like my traditional local breakfast. Beware that some famous stalls close on certain days.
5
Easy to find and the best (my opinion) food court in Singapore. Over 80+ stalls serving a wide range of regional dishes (Singaporean, Malay, Indian, Chinese). Sit down, eat and mix with the locals for $2 - $6 a meal. There is also a very good range of fresh fruit and juice bars plus a number of stalls doing local pastries and deserts. My favourite recommendation would be the fishball soup and the famous Tiong Bahru fried oyster. We ate here a number of times on our last visit and would also recommend going for Lunch as a number of stalls close in the evening
5
If your a tourist in Singapore, if you are a local or working here ... you cannot miss this place. If you see a big line at a stall, follow it and you will not regret. Must try in my opinion: the chwee kueh at Jian Bo and the chicken rice in the stall right off the entrance. Best time to go is at launch - great for a dinner too but some stalls will be closed
5
Hawker markets are the place to eat in Singapore. This particular market is well known in Singapore for its selection and the quality of the food served out of the stalls. I ate here four times on a recent stay at the Link Hotel in the same neighborhood. This place has vendors selling different types of Chinese, Malay, and Indian food as well as coffee, juice, and fresh fruit. It is a great experience and ridiculously cheap. I ate like a king for the equivalent of about US$6
5
Have been here a number of times and the food is always great and cheap, plus there is some shopping downstairs for fresh fruits to take back to the hotel
5
Best twa kwa pok!
Good place to try local food. Tasty to tummy n wallet. Stroll around area for nice cafes as well as traditional bakery shop call Gracier (might mis spell)
4
This venue should be on your list where to eat...reasonably priced, good array and great fruit juices(cheaper than coffee ).
Walk around to the different outlets and as the prices are cheap make sure you get a few plates !
4
Love the varieties of local food here. Tried a few; like the fried rice, noodles and they are cheap, according to Sg standard. The fried rice is only SGD3 per plate. Can be quite crowded during lunch time.
5
This place serves the best local food in Singapore. Warn you - it's hot and humid here. But you will be reward with yummy cheap local food! It is quite a distance from the Tiong Bahru MRT station even though they bear the same name!
5
The centrepiece of old Tiong Bahru estate. Plenty of treats around the circular food centre, lots of seating too. Try the Jian Bo chwee kueh.
4
Tasty, quick and cheap with nearly unlimited choice. How could you go wrong? Just point at what you want if you're worried about any language barrier.
5
The Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre is one of the best in Singapore . It is popular with locals and expatriates who are living in Singapore for a period of time when they are posted here for their overseas jobs. The Food Centre is on level 2 and the market is on level one. It is located at 83 Seng Poh Road where you can find the old SIT flats built by the Lim Yew Hock government before 1959.The market sells vegetables, fish, meat, fresh flowers and dried sea food. The food centre has about 80 stalls selling rice, porridge, kway chap, roasted meat, chwee kuey, bah pao, rojak and mee jiang kuey. You can get mostly Chinese and some Indian and Malay food. The best stalls are the chwee kuey and the kway chap but you must be prepared to queue up for up to half an hour during peak hours. The price is reasonable and if you go for lunch at 11.30 am you will probably get a seat.This is the place where you get to savour the best local dishes at reasonable prices. Some of the hawkers have been selling here for more than 30 years. I have been eating for the last 30 years and I still enjoy the food during my sunset years. God willing I shall be eating here till my last month on earth
5
The Tiong Bahru food centre has a myriad of food places to choose from- offering Chinese, Malay, and Singaporean cuisines as well as some others like Thai. The pricing is very reasonable- $2 for Char Kway Teo noodles and one of the best noodles I've had!Don't go past the Thai restaurant right near the entrance, delicious Pad Thai, tofu and tom yum soup all for great value! Also the fruit juice shop is fresh and serve delicious juices like mango and papay
5
This food center is inside the Tiong Bahru Market and has the largest food court I have ever seen. There are numerous food stalls offering large selection of hot food, cold entrees, drinks, and desserts. The most attractive element of this food court for me is that I could watch my order being made in front of my eyes. What impressed me is that this food court is very clean and frequent by locals. Be sure to try the coffee stand "238" that serves hot and ice coffee as well as milk tea. Bring your appetite
5
We always go Tiong Bahru for the chicken rice and the mixed pork soup. Queues are always long for this 2 eating stores .....but the chicken rice and the mixed pork soup is a must eat at Tiong Bahru food centre . Must try !!!!
5
A huge hall/mall/center with a multitude of small stands/shops/stalls serving various foods, drinks, confectionarys, etc. Went for breakfast and had exceptional coffee and some kind of Chinese donut. The just walked around and sampled whatever looked appealing.
4
A large range of food stalls with all you will need for a great, cheap meal anytime time of the day. Gets busy at lunchtimes when local office/shop/hotel workers have lunch but that adds to the charm.
2
yeh, I copped a bad serve. Fried Kway teow from shop 2-11. Sorry guys but it did happen. Everything seemed good at the time, but about 4 hours after eating ,no other food or drink, i was hit with a severe attack of diarrhea and vomiting that hit hard and passed after suffering for about 6 hours. Total clean out in all sections, if you get my drift. Apparently Singapore can get some rough clams (red ones) that will do you damage. Real shame, it is one of the things i was really looking forward to in Singapore but not meant to be
5
We were staying at Nostalgia Hotel and from the get-go I was wanting to experience the food courts in Singapore. This one was just around the corner from our hotel so we ate here most nights. Our only disappointment was that for some reason 50-75% of the stalls were closed every night of the week we stayed so the choice available wasn't as good as everyone else seems to have experienced - however most stalls have large menus so it wasn't too much of a problem. Our first night we got 3 main courses for 14SD which is about Â£7 in English money and we were stuffed.Some great food and drink going on here and best of all was the atmosphere, sitting among the locals eating with chopsticks is a memory we'll treasure - especially the lady with the car horn that she beeps when shouting out your number, a real character that one
5
I began my six-hour stopover in Singapore by going to Tiong Bahru food centre, which was a 15-minute walk from my hotel. It was a hazy and humid trek that built up my appetite for some tasty and cheap local delicacies. I wasn't sure what to expect so didn't keep my hopes up. I had first heard of the Tiong Bahru Food Centre from watching Anthony Bourdain's 'Layover Singapore' and decided that I have to go here!! And it was a great tip from the show - thanks Anthony!!! This place is buzzing with raw food sellers on the bottom level, and cooked food stalls on the second level up the escalators. I wasn't sure what to eat, so had a stroll around before setting to have a local coffee. It was muddy brown and I thought 'this isn't going to be good'. But was I wrong!!! It tasted amazing - and I thought 'yes!!!! this is why I am here - to taste the local food and I'm sure it's not going to be disappointing'. Next I went to 'Jian Bo Shui Kueh' and had some yummy, sticky and greasy jian bo shui kuehs (which are these glutinous little rice cakes) with some chilli jam-like topping. Oh that was so delish- I sometimes have cravings for it. I highly recommend Tiong Bahru food centre if you want to get a good start and feel for local Singapore food and breakfast life
5
When I first arrived at this place, I was very confuse what to eat because there is a lot of different food to choose. This food court is really huge. Although this place is really crowded especially during lunch time, but the queue is still somewhat ok. The price is cheap, very cheap. But the taste tho, it's authentic. Try to get here for breakfast, where you can find the uncle or auntie sells a fresh warm bun. It's just delicious. Definitely will go here again when visit singapore another time
4
Love that there is a lot of open space around the seated areas. Great selection of food! We loved the Tiong Bahru Kampo carrot cake, hui ji fish ball noodles and Zheng yu yuan Wei wanton noodles. Similar to other places, the good stalls all have long lines but it feels less crowded. Food is cheap and overall very comfortable atmosphere having lunch here. Looking forward to trying it again
5
A very large and diverse food court located in the interesting and groovy area of Tiong Bahru. Well worth taking a walk around the area. Low-rise 20th century public housing dating from 1930s onward has been pleasantly revitalised and is dotted with bakeries, coffee houses and independent bookstores. The food court was only partly open during our mid afternoon visit. We had some pretty decent pork buns and tried the rice cakes, which are apparently legendary
4
Wide selection of stalls offering standard food court type food.Seating capacity, even on Sunday lunch was no issue. Ventilation was adequate.Strategy for seating location is a useful consideration. Otherwise, be prepare for a long walk with you tray of purchase to your seat. Cannot comment on the quality of food. Just to many
1
An ordinary food court with very standard offerings. Nothing special to warrant a special trip to get to.
Will eat there if I happen to be around the area and has no where else to go.
4
This food center is located at 2nd floor of Tiong Bahru Market, 800 m walking from Tiong Bahru MRT station. Lookslike a typical Singapore neighborhood eating place, but this one is loaded with legendary stalls. Visit here at 730 am to meet an old friend. Great food in local life style ambience. Try the yu tiao, lor mee, fish ball, soyabean milk, and off course coffee. Try to dip yu tiao into hot coffee (this case I find best with sweet coffee C, C for creamer) and that trigger an addiction. If you stay in kitchen equipped hotel and feel like cooking, go down to market at ground floor, they sell fresh ingredient that may impress Anthony Bourdain.
4
Had About 6 dishes between the 4 of us. The best ever juice bar here, orange and passion fruit juice, the most amazing drink we have ever had.we each had 2! Food great and very cheap. Caught a cab as was unable to find it the night before from tiong bahru mrt. It's upstairs from the tiong bahru market. Great lunc
4
Good cheap food available upstairs. There are plenty of options however not a lot of seafood options which is strange as there is a large seafood market downstairs. We had to go to Robertson Quay to get some seafood, as we were not given too many options at the food market upstairs
5
We were in Singapore in january with my husband spendind some time in Asia. It was our first time in Singapore and having seen a reportage by Anthony Bourdain we decided to follow his footsteps and go to Tiong Bahru food center.I must admit i loved the experience so much, all the food at your disposal reunited in one place is just fun and great.You can stroll from one stall to the other eating so many local treats,we had duck,fantastic fresh juices,we did know all the names of what we ate,but it was so delicious,cheap and so much fun to eat with locals in an informal way.I will advise not to be snobish and really go to this quite non touristic place,to open your mind and see some real singaporian life,not sophisticated but so interesting. Better be hungry if you go,you will want to taste everything
3
Especially the prawn noodle at the corner stall call Chu Nan prawn noodle. Not worth a quece. The broth is so plain and meat not tender. More effort to pay on making a good broth which is the key for prawn mee. The wonton noodle next door was great and worth for a quece..the lor mee store at the right corner of the escalator was grea
5
This was the second time I been here and eat the same thing, the boneless hainanese chicken rice! So yummy! It only cost me 2,5 SGD if buy 3 portions.It was located after the 235 Drink Stations. I found this recommendation via Ladyironchef's blog. It always have a long queue. I love the broth and how soft the chicken! Also the sweet sour pickles! Even when I'm writing this, I feel hungry again! Too bad I forgot to photo that delish food, because I reviewed it around 2 months ago in a different page on Trip Advisor, kindly check it out
5
A fantastic cheap Hawker style food market with produce for sale on the ground floor and loads of amazing restaurants on the first floor. I found out about this place based on an article written about the food in Singapore by the renowned chef Tetsuya Wakuda who says 9 times out of 10 he eats breakfast here when in Singapore

People complain that food in Singapore is to expensive! Well they just aren't looking far enough!! If you don't have an open mind or belly, then this Hawker market isn't for you! But if you want to eat your way through some amazing cultural delights & try lots of new food, this place is for you! Hubby even tried frog leg porridge! The fresh juices are super cheap & the iced desserts are delicious!! Best way to eat in Singapore

The best local food is often not in fancy restaurants but in no frills neighborhood stalls passed down through generations in hawker centers like this. We went out of our way to find these gems and had visited probably 9-10 different hawker centers during our visit to Singapore. This is by far our favorite. What we especially love is the neighborly atmosphere, most patrons are from around the area who have probably been eating there for decades. The layout of the center is much more open and comfortable than many of the other more famous centers like Maxwell. You really get the sense that this is the heart of a community. In terms of food choices, we have our favorites like the Fried Kway Teow at #11...but really if you see people lining up at any stall, you can't go wrong.

I came here on a hot afternoon for a simple dessert. My Chinese was not that good, and I was treated rudely by when ordering my food when I speak in broken Chinese. I left without ordering the food.
4
This is a must visit place for some of the best food we ate while in singapore we tried for the first time fish ball soup and it was so good. We would highly reco.ed this place for lunch while in singapore.
4
This is a MUST for really getting idea of what traditional Singapore food is all about. If you are a tourist, expat or someone just passing through, stop in and get some of this traditional Chinese food from a hawker center viewpoint.
5
I love the food here, it is one of the best you can find at a hawker centre in Singapore. The average meal with drink is under $4.00 so it is definitely affordable too! Highly recommended

Ok, first of all, don't except it's going to be glamour, it's somekind like market, but still indoor with lot of food stalls , anything you want to try in singapore are mostly here, from crab mee, laksa, hainan chicken rice, crispy pork, roasted pork, pork me, even any kinds of soup. The place for sure isn't cold, no airconditioner, it's indoor with open air, so just wear something simple casual light, and enjoy singapore ...
5
What a fantastic place!! We were recommended to go here by one of the very friendly Taxi Drivers in this city. The food choices were fabulous, it took us over an hour to make a decision. We finally choice Lemon Chicken and a pancake with chicken, egg and onion. All of this for less than $15
5
I visit Singapore every year, and it always amazes me to see Singapore grow and develop. However, I think that the hawker food has steadily declined in quality over the years. The food at Tiong Bahru however feels like it's getting better and better.Try the tofu drink and dessert. I don't remember the name of that stall, but you won't need to, there's always a line. I also recommend the prawn and pork noodle stall and the wonton noodle stall. A lot of people like lor mee; it isn't my favorite thing, but the lor mee here is good too. Also, check out the flower shops on the bottom floor. Very pretty and exotic flowers!

We live in Singapore each summer and have eaten at most of the Hawker Centers here. Tiong Bahru was one of last destinations, and I will say it was worth the cab ride. It is very nice, located on the second floor of a plaza. They have nice open air dinning or good airflow under the roof. There is a duck place their with a long que. I do not know the name, but the duck rice was amazing! There is also a juice shop here where they make the juice fresh as you wait, also delicious. The place was much cleaner than most hawker centers, EXCEPT, the bathrooms which were pure horrible. I was shocked that the entire hawker center seemed modern and clean, but the bathrooms were medieval and not sanitary. Maybe drop down to the first floor and see if there is something cleaner, or "hold it" until you get somewhere else
5
this place is great, second time in Singapore and had to make the effort to get here. Last time I had the best Laksa, couldn't find the place but instead had the best Sesame Chicken Rice from Hainanese Chicken Rice. All my friends go on about chicken rice so I thought for $3.50 why not try it, OMG the best. My friend had lemon chicken rice for $2.50 with a second serve of just chicken for $2. there is so much to choose from including avocado shakes and desserts, everything is so well priced you can't afford no to g

Though the Tiong Bahru Food Centre doesn't have quite the cachet of Maxwell Road or any of the more well-known hawker centres, it still has some great food and souvenirs, plus it is fast becoming the in thing to do for Singaporeans. I had two really good breakfasts here, one day it was nasi lemak, and another it was fried carrot cake. There is also a market on the bottom floor in which I purchased a bag of apples to munch on back at the hotel. This is another of the hawker centres which I would wholeheartedly recommend you check out when you come to Singapore, it is just a short walk from the Tiong Bahru MRT station, or get off the bus near the Hotel Nostalgia
4
Love this neighbourhood, its got the old flavour of Singapore but is quickly filling up with lots of lovely shops, restaurants and cafes. Great for a Sunday stroll, grabbing great coffee and then onto some local flavours at the market
4
You will be spoilt for choice here. So many stalls offering mainly local delicacies at a very cheap price. You can get everything from pastries to different kinds of noodles and rice and even western food. It's about 15 mins walk from Outram Park MRT.
4
Either you are looking for laksa, curry rice, satay or any other specialty from the region this is a must place to visit on weekdays. Don't forget your tissues and be patient with lines.
4
Good place and cheap price. We can find many kind of local food and it is closed to Tiong Bahru market easy for shopping
4
Found the best kaya toast * coffee place in this hawker center.
We went back 4 days in a row and ordered 5 portions every time!
Very clean.
3
typical singapore hawker food center..... good for local cuisine hunt... many famous food in this food center.......
5
We loved Tiong Bahru food centre! We found it to be more clean and convenient than others such as Old Airport Rd. It was a very short walk from where we were staying (Wangz). For only a few dollars it was easy to find amazing and plentiful food
5
Not a worry at Teck Seng. Soybean milk, beancurd or a mix of soybean milk and grass jelly, they have it all; but for me soybean milk alone justifies the visit. [Quick tip] There's always a long queue every weekend and everything is sold out quickly too, so do come early ;-) Things seem to cool down a great deal on weekdays. Buy it's always worth the wait.The milk is good and if you ask for it to be made sweet it will be. One special thing that keeps me coming back is that Ah Seng and his wife know my taste for soybean milk and without waiting for me to remind them, they just make it perfect.*Teck Seng Soybean Milk #02-69(Open 2am-1pm; Closed on Mondays)Tiong Bahru Food Centre83 Seng Poh R
4
If you're a tourist in Singapore this is the place you MUST try to experience local cuisine. The place is very easy to reach since it's just a walking distance from Tiong Bahru MRT. Plenty of choices, some of the stall is quite famous so the queue could be a bit long sometimes. Best time to go is during breakfast
5
A daily visit to Tiong Bahru Food Centre/Hawkers Market was our favourite daily activity. We had our breakfast at this place every morning and each time we leave with happy tummies :-). So many food stalls to choose from. Make sure you look for stalls with the highhest rating (A),this rate was supposed to be an indication of the cleanliness of the food and stall
4
Food is good, depending what stores you go too. The Chicken Rice there is good. They usually say the one with the longesr queue for any store is normally better
4
Some authentic and affordable food.. Ate lots here so come with an empty stomach.. Lots of people in the middle of the day.
4
If this is the upstairs Food Market, it is a cheap place to enjoy local food. The volume of people guarantees a good turnover.
4
Food stalls are located on the upper level and wet market on the ground floor at this popular huge hawker center. Many delicious award winning prepared food options from roast pork, roast duck, laksa, noodles, pastries, fresh juices, coffee and much much more.
5
The food, the vibe, the architecture... everything in here I just loved. More locals than tourists, the whole Tiong Bahru estate has a really pleasant vibe about it. The Bauhaus-infused architecture always hits a soft spot with me. And the Tiong Bahru market and food court doubly so. Open and airy with palm tress growing and sunlight flooding in through the middle, and the lively yet relaxed community feel about it - it was lovely just sitting there. Throw in the countless hawker stalls (the majority of which had A ratings) serving up some of the best food I've eaten at unbeatable prices - and all times of day covered from breakfast through lunch to dinner.I just didn't want to leave.
4
This place was within walking distance from our hotel. We came here because of suggestions from travel channel/bourdain. We headed straight for the Pork Ribs and Prawn Noodle Soup stand. The queue was long, not surprised, since it was generously touted by Bourdain. The soup did not disappoint. We were here at night and it was late enough where a few stands were closed or closing down, so I wasn't able to try the wonton soup next door. There was ample seating but I can see how it might be really crowded during peak meal times
4
This hawker centre was right across the road from our hotel. Went here one evening and were blown away by so much choice. Had the chicken and rice which was nice with a sugar cane drink. Cant remember how much it was but was very cheap less than $5.00. Nice to see all the locals out eating there
5
Tiong Bahru food centre remains one of the most authentically Singaporean hawkers centers. Situated in one of the oldest government housing (HDB) estates, it's a great old school place in an increasingly hipster neighborhood. The food here is varied, but my personal favorites are the pig innards and wanton noodles. Malay Muslim food is good here, but this hawker center's strength is clearly Singaporean-Chinese food.The only down point is that this place DOES get fairly hot during the day. Seats are of course all in the shade, but ventilation could be improved
5
Nearly any kind of Asian food you can quickly think of is available at no more than a couple of dollars. The place is also just a short walk from the nearest MRT station. Grab a cold soya bean drink and bowl of noodles, sit back and enjoy
5
A true Singapore must for those that want to endulge in real and cheap Asian food. Much better then China Town's hawker market, barely any tourists, and usually no dish over three dollars. The many stalls offer anything thinkablke, from sugar cane refreshment drinks to different soups to grilled poultry or typical Chiness BBQ. All this you will enyoy while seated amongst the locals. Go and enjoy the scenary
4
Clean, fast and noisy - just the way hawker centers should be! Enjoyed my kaya breakfast one morning, and my Hainanese chicken rice one dinner! Great attitude by the stall owners, all eager to serve! Delicious as well!
5
I must have been the only tourist there. Friendly locals, excellent variety of food at low prices. Felt like I was getting a more realistic sampling of the local fare
5
I come to Singapore frequently on business but have never eaten in hawker market. Newton Circle is the one popularly known but I am told is now very expensive and touristy. Our local host (not on business this time) showed us all over both floors and then treated us to a typical chicken rice lunch along with chicken feet soup, almond soy milk and durian on shaved ice. All delicious and you 'still had change from half a crown' (not literally of course) but no more than 6 bucks a head.
5
Great Hawker market with a wide selection of Chinese food to pick from - worth a visit just to look at all the various dishes being prepared!We opted to eat at Lee Hing Kee Cantonese Roasted based on the queue and the great looking plate of food served before us. Char Sieu with Rice was flavourful with a great gravy sauce and amazing value for $3.50. The Chicken Rice was equally tasty and the duck dishes also look great.If you are looking for a Hawker market experience that is great value and an explosion of the senses then Tiong Bahru market should be on your itinerary
3
This food centre is clean and well maintained. Parking is a problem. Not many parking lots.but u dun need to wait too long for parking as most of the patrons wun take long to leave the place.There r plenty of choices. And alot of famous food can b found here. Very large compound.spacious enough.not cramped at allVery good place for breakfast
4
A nice big hawker center in the heart of the trendy Tiong Bahru district. Big selection of stalls, though most are Chinese or seafood, not many Halal options. The shark nugget soup is a must try. I don't know what exactly was in the syrupy stuff, but super good. The pork rice is also very good. Prices are of course super low too
5
Having just returned from our second stay in Singapore, Tiong Bahru Market has become almost a daily part of our routine.After discovering it 3 years ago on our first trip, it was always going to be a regular feature in our future travels.I personally love hawker centres and have made it to as many of the main centres as I could. Tiong Bahru still rates amongst my favourites.Fristly, this IS the place to come in the morning. Whilst other centres start to wind up later morning/early afternoon, this place is buzzing by 7am -mainly due to the ground floor markets (fish, meat, fruit, eggs, flowers). Upstairs the food level serves a variety of morning friendly options.The atmosphere here is relaxed, quiet (relatively) and laid back. Even when it's busy (and there will be long queues at the favourite stalls) this market never feels frenetic like say little india or maxwell during lunch peak. You can still come (with family in tow) find a table and have a pleasant meal, albeit with longer waiting times. Whilst always rating in the top 5 hawker centres, TB seems to dodge the tourist hordes due to its suburban locale, making it the perfect blend of great local food and (for lack of a better word) authentic feel.Like most centres, there are some (2) pure vegetarian stalls as well as the usual suspect.My favourites are the Lor Mee stalls and I am a sucker for Char Siew and BBQ Pork. There is also a Bao shop which does some great Char Siew Bao & Siu Mai. It will be pretty obvious which the faves are, like anywhere, and expect to wait a while on a busy day. Come first this on a quiet day (wed) and the usually long queues are gone. I grabbed a Lor Mee from stall 80 without a queue, when ordinarily it would be 10 deep at least.Prices are great, a Lor Mee and a Char Siew noodle with side dumpling soup, will set you back SGD$6.50.The neighbourhood is also great for a walk around, with plenty more eateries and cafes to be found.Make Tiong Bahru part of your morning routine
4
Neighbourhood is a must go see for any traveller. We are plunged in the 60 's or late 50's with a selection of beautiful Art Deco or quasi Modern Style buildings . Food centre is awesome .Liked the Thai place called Thai Lion kitchen, super clean place a very fragrant food but there is a huge selection of food stalls
4
It is recommended by a friend when I told her that I wanted authentic breakfast in early morning (7 am) and very satisfied with the options provided. You can have any kind of foods that you want. I tried Bak Chor Mee (noodle soup with pork slice and meat balls)..hmm yummy. Will be back
5
I love grilled tau pok. Very hard to find good ones. How do I define good?1. Stuffed well (not stingy)2. Grilled well (over charcoal, not over electric toaster and must be crispy)3. Excellent sauce (I like the flavour of ginger flower in my sauce)A stall in Tiong Bahru Food Centre called Tau Kwar Pop, hits all the sweet spots.Minimum a monthly fix for me
3
This place is slightly more renovated and newish compared to say maxwell. There are a couple of "anchor" tenants here. Tiong bahru is well known for their chicken rice and chwee kuay stalls. Other than that, it's a typical hawker centre
5
Great food at very cheap prices...so many choices from lots of Asian cultures..great traditional deserts.
5
Tion Bahru Kway Teow stall is a must. Also Tiang Tiang Dessert bar - their black rice pudding is the best I have had. Yummy Popiah too just at top of escalators
5
The hawker centre offers a wide range of amazing food. I have tried congee, hainan chicken rice, fresh juice etc. THEY ARE ALL AMAZING at very reasonable price. Must go!
5
First-rate hawker food at very reasonable prices. A refreshing change from many of the food courts in the City Centre. And much more comfortable (and cleaner) than similar hawker food centres in the suburbs. Good selection of all the local favourites, eg the 2 Char Kway Teow stalls
5
Our family group of 4 had been booked into a nearby hotel for a 3 night stay and were looking for somewhere "local" for breakfasts. We certainly landed on our feet when we went to the Tiong Bahru Food Centre !The food court is on the first floor above the local wet market and is under cover, but not enclosed, so you eat in the local climate, not in an airconditioned, sterile, shopping centre food court. From appearances, many locals eat there and the place always seemed to be pretty busy. There is a large selection of different food stalls offering a wide variety of Asian cuisines, as well as several different drink stalls. The layout is a large courtyard, open to the air in the centre with stalls on the periphery and spacious seating inside the periphery.The food we had from every stall we tried was cheap and, more importantly, delicious. I wish I could remember the individual dishes and stalls better as my memory is one continuous feast of flavours, washed down with either coffee, hot ginger drink or Tiger beer depending on the time of day (we did not just have breakfast there). You could eat here every day for a month and not exhaust the choices of dishes on offer. Visitors to Singapore should have at least one meal here. Singapore has many excellent places to eat at every price point possible but the Tiong Bahru Food Centre will give you a delicious, authentic local meal in a local environment at local prices. I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes !The Centre is a short walk (less than 1km) from the Tiong Bahru MRT stop (EW17) and I would recommend going at breakfast or lunch time when nearly all the stalls are open
5
This is definitely a very authentic Singaporean experience. It's one of the best hawker centres in Singapore. There are so many stalls with so many delicious food to try. We came on weekend for brunch and the place was packed!!! We ordered so many food but managed to finish them all. The porridge was delicious. My favourite (and there were a long queue at this stall) is Jian Bo Shui Kueh that sells soft steamed rice cake with spicy preserved radish on top.Definitely a must try for visitors to Singapore. All cab drivers should know this place, and once you are there, just see which stalls that have long queue or check what people at other tables are buying
5
You can't go wrong with this one. We are here for both breakfast and lunch and the food is really good. You will pay an average of ten dollars for a meal for two. I also recommend the drinks such as the sugar cane or the coffee
4
This is a area which buildings are kept under conversation, and there is a guided trail that will take you around Tiong Bahru area. This is one of my favourite place for my breakfast fix. There is this porridge store that serve the best raw fish, with a nice seasoning of sesame oil, chilli padi and peppered with sesame seeds. Just look out for the store with huge “163” on it’s signage. Do go early, as they finish selling all the stuff by 10.00AM. There are also plenty of stores selling Lor Mee, noodle in dark gravy, most of pretty good, my personal fav is a corner store (which I’ve forgotten it’s name, sorry!).Dont forget to pick up some exotic, seasonal fresh fruits on level 1, there are so many varieties of fresh produces that are cheaper than supermarket, with mind boggling choice
4
This is one of my favourite hawker centre in Singapore serving huge varieties of good local food. From the Lor Mee to Roasted delight Hong Kong style to the all time favourite Chwee Guai. I would recommend this place for the overseas travellers to Singapore rather then the Newton circles, Lau Pa Sat or smith street food centre.Only set back is the limited parking area should you decide to drive in during lunch time
4
Good hawker fare at very reasonable prices. Lots to choose from and centrally located in Singapore. The market does not have much stalls open in the night though, but the area around it has many small and interesting eateries.
4
So much choice, and such good prices, in an area full of Singapore history, one of the first social housing projects is around the market and all the taxi drivers know it.
4
Its a nice little food centre by the tiong bahru centre where you can find a nice mcdonalds subway as well as bread talk. its got few other local restaurants over all a nice small centre.
5
Enjoy a walk around this '50s/'60s-vintage neighborhood and some delicious hawker stall food in the market.
4
You can find everything in the food center, but I loved the place that served all kind of porridges for breakfast, unfortunately, I can't remember the name.
5
I'm impressed with the food in Singapore in general, but the hawker centers in particular just blow me away with how good is the food. Head on over to the Tiong Bahru Food Centre and try the noodles at the very descriptive "Kim Fa Fish Ball Minced Meat Noodle" stall. It was awesome and only $3. Really. $3
5
The food stalls are upstairs in the market, take the escalator! Before entering do check the heritage trail notice outside; the building is not as old as it looks, it was modernised and styled around 2004.As the notice states, quite a few of the businesses have been trading for over 50 years. But you won’t pay any extra for this experience, prices are very reasonable, we had a meal for 2 with soft drinks (just one course) and it cost about S$8! The meals we ate there were really good both in value and taste. Toilets on same floor, clean and free.The building is splendid, with an open central courtyard with trees growing in it. At night coloured lights in the ceiling make it very attractive. And there are plenty of quiet tables. It stays open until about 10pm but only a few vendors stay open that late.While there, do check out the whole area which was developed from the 1930s in Art Deco style. It’s a delightful part of the city
4
This food centre has everything, and most are good to great. You can find the famous chwee kueh and Tanglin pau stalls here, as well as other dishes such as duck rice, mee pok fishball noodles, beancurd drinks, and kway chap. Do take the time to sample the food, which is cheap and good. Noodles start from a low $2.50. This place is now popular with the tourists too, and there is easy access via the Outram MRT which is just down the road.On the ground floor, there is a wet market where it seems you can find everything from fresh vegetables and seafood to NZ beef and lamb. They even have stalls selling dried scallops and clothes.Wander along the neighbouring side streets for a glimpse of local life, though the area has been gentrified and gone upmarket
5
Wanted a bit more of an authentic/old fashioned feel to Singapore, and headed to Tiong Bahru market centre to have a look. What we found was a wonderful market and food centre, with lots of character and colour, and fabulous, friendly people willing to chat and explain what we looking at and hoping to eat. With over 60 odd food stalls to choose your meal from, you are spoilt for choice, and the prices are so cheap, it's hard to comprehend how other parts of Singapore are so ridiculously expensive.Our meal was delicious. This area is also interesting to walk around and explore
5
Loved this real experience of Singapore which is getting harder to find now as they are all being replaced by freezing cold food courts in the malls. Also, these are local prices here.Loved the Chicken Biriyani and roti with sugar cane juice (2 stalls that are in one corner). Also great was the egg sponge cakes. Not enough time or tummy space to eat more.Will be back for sure
4
We ate here almost every day. The variety of local food is fantastic. It is packed with locals for lunch and dinner, which is a great sign! Also excellent value for money with the average meal costing around $4.
5
totally local food market with prepared food on the upper level with covered and open air tables. great indonesian and singaporean delicacies. great fresh cane juice etc. 1.50sgd for handmade pohpia is relish. well worth a visit for breakfast and lunch!
5
no air-con but have many local yummy food for you or your overseas food to visit if you wanna show them :)
5
Stall number 5 makes Chwee Kueh (Shui Kueh) and it was absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend it. One of my new favourite foods. Also, stall number 60 for the Char Siew is fantastic.
4
Faced on Tiong Bahru Rd. so easy to get there.
Nice loco food you can get.
4
The Loh Mee is a must try. Also are the CKT and Wan Tan Mee located in the same food court.After getting out from the MRT station, turn left and walk all the way down until you arrive Block 20, then turn right and after about 150 meter you will arrive
3
You can't complain for the price (most meals range from $2-$5) and there are some great ones! The ladies that run L21 cafe have lovely service, great eggs, great teh and kopi and decent toast. For good Hainanese chicken go to stall 82For good roasted duck, stall 60On the left as you walk in there is a good hokkien mee and a good nasi lemak stall. Watch out for a particular vendor in this centre who rips you off by not giving you change. I won't say who he is... But I'm glad his terrible ways made me search out the lovely ladies at L21
4
It is very near the Wangz hotel and there are many Art-Deco style buildings in the area. You can't miss the circular entrance building situated at a corner. The unpretentious food centre is above the day-market on the ground floor. Countless food stalls, you will be spoiled for choice! My relatives who stay in Singapore eat here often and they rave about the quality of food and the low prices. We tried the beef noodles made by a couple from China, it cost about SGD5 for a bowl. There are Muslim/halal stalls too, so it is suitable for most who go there
4
This food court is a new appearance to me. 10 years ago it was an open hawker centre. Of course, I miss the old style more. We were glad to find out that the same old stalls can still be found after this big renovation. My heart slow down the beating immediately. It is one of the most go hawker centre if you want to look for the authentic Chinese style local food such as Chou Zhou, Cantonese porridge
5
Go eat here - if you don't, you just haven't visited Singapore. For breakfast, you have to do the rice cakes (Chwee Kway), look for the long lines. There is also lor mee, carrot cake, chee chong fun... oh i can go on. Reseach this place, it's awesome!
4
Finally found a non-touristy local community hub. Much better than Orchard Road and Clark Quay. Real local food and good prices.
3
nothing availabel to vegetarians. pleanty of food outlets offering local cuisine with delicacies from korea, china, & the region. cheap & very popular among locals.
4
Many choices, if you don't want to pay restaurant prices come here. If you like to drink beer you can get a big bottle of Tiger for about $4 S if you look around.
5
Tough to do one review for all the stands, but this place gave the best of my favorite singaporean street food dishes. After trying a lot of them during the week, this place got top marks for the hainanese chicken (boiled and roasted), cantonese roasted duck, Ciar Shew, and of course the Chwee Kueh. And if you go, dont forget to hit up the desert stand, and try some of the crazy crazy Singaporean deserts, like the thing with shaved ice with food coloring, on top of a stew of weird sweet things and some random salty corn
4
I love Tiong Bahru! It is such a beautiful area with loads of eateries around. You'll never starve here. There's even a book entitled "I Ate Tiong Bahru". The food centre at the Tiong Bahru Market is quite good. One thing I love about Singapore is you hardly ever have to worry about hygiene. It's very clean and the food is not bad. If you're travelling in a big party this is a good place to order a whole bunch of food and try everything.We went on Friday and Sunday. It was really loud on Sunday morning as they were having a local sing-off (or so it seemed). !PRO-TIP: Get the freshly squeezed sugar cane with lemon drink. It's amazingly refreshing and does wonders for a recovery morning!

Click HERE http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/04/tiong-bahru-market-food-centre-food.html for full review and photosThe first dish was Kovan rojak starts at $3, add $2 for jellyfish and $1 for century egg. So we went for the full set which was buried in punchy gravy and heaps of peanuts. Nearly everything was good,the century egg was surprisingly bouncy. However, the gravy needs more Assam/tamarind paste and lime juices to shine. This soggy Tau Pok and You Tiao (dough fritters) may appeal to those who likes them chewy but we prefer crunchy, well-toasted onesHence, its twin, the Tau Kwah Poh ($4) hit the right note. The dried cuttlefish, dough fritters and beancurd puff were grilled upon order and stayed crisp till the last bits. The mango, cucumber and pineapple lent a refreshing note when dipped into the chilli sauce and rojak shrimp paste. Thanks to the Kovan Rojak, there was ample leftover gravy to go with the tau kwa poh....For other yummy food such as chwee kuey and lor mee, visit : www. dairycream.blogspot.s

A dear friend and I chose this place to catch up and wanted to have local food options. This was my second visit to this second floor food center. We must have sourced from 5-6 vendors through the evening and all the selections were good. I particularly liked the carrot cake, the roti dishes, mee (noodles), juices, ice desserts. I do dine vegetarian where I can and there were enough options available to satisfy me well. But where lines formed, those stalls specialized in duck and meat specialties. We actually didn't come here because prices were reasonable, but the ambiance, even though covered outdoors, offered a nice setting to sit at length and catch up with plentiful seating available ... and the wide variety of food ensured any of us would be more than satisfied.On food centers, I find this one more appealing than Newton Circus ... the stall owners appear to have been around a long time and appear to be looking after each other as family. And I do like the fact that it is covered, sheltered from the rain, but open to the sky above in the center.Worth a try (if not many a repeat visit
4
An excellent location to experience the local cuisine. A vast array of stalls await you with a wide variety of local flavors to suit any palette, served from clean stalls and welcoming local small business owners. Look for the queue to choose a local favourite. Singaporeans appreciate change so stalls fall in and out of favor. Dishes start at one dollar and fifty cents.
5
We stayed 10 days and visited lots of Hawker centres (at least 10) this was the closest to our hotel and really was fantastic and I think the cheapest of all, food was fffffrreesshh and absolutely yummy, place was clean and they introduced a tray return during our vist and everyone adapted instantly to the tray return system. Fab plac
4
We came here to sample real Singaporean food and were not disappointed. The second floor is organized like a food court with a couple dozen or so selections. Look for the stalls that have the longest lineups, that is your tip of what the locals fave. Most meals are $3 or so, so it is extremely affordable. The place is very clean, and the tables were cleared regularly. There was a nice vibe to the place.One thing I noted was how friendly everyone was. The stall owners seemed to be very helpful and really enjoyed helping the customers, even the busy ones. All in all, it was a fun experience and I am glad we went
