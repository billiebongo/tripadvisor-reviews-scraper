I had the DeLancey and the orange juice combo and it was very filling, well presented and just well made. I really enjoyed my meal. It is quite pricey by the looks of the menu but worth every penny spent!
4
We ordered different varieties and I enjoyed the Scandinavian...like how the salmon is done!! Would recommend the scones too!! The steak was disappointing though.
4
The variety of breakfast dishes is second to none. And the drinks are great too! They had Brazilian cheese bread for us to try, delicious!
5
Food was delicious too. Ordered English Breakfast and Norwegian (something). All the staffs are extremely polite and professional. This is my second time visiting wild honey. Their standard is as good as the Mandarin Gallery's outlet!
5
Lovely lovely brunch. Made a reservation in advance so didn't have to wait at all! Great food as usual
4
Food quality is still quite good. Atmosphere was great but the staffs need to be more attentive as it seems that they are rather busy with their own stuffs
4
Food was good though my poached egg n ham dish could have done with more salad. Service was up to par but no stock for Earl Grey tea? Not impressed by that.
5
The breakfast was to die for. It is so good! We had the French Toast, full English, Canadian pancakes, a ridiculous breakfast sandwich, and a take on Eggs Benedict with Brioche and prosciutto! Holy Moly. Highly recommend. The lattes come with frozen espresso and warm milk to pour over!
5
second time at this outlet and it did not disappoint. Had the savoury French toast with fried poached eggs, salsa and spinach soufflÃ©... finished it all! Would also like to comment on the excellent service by a young female waitress whose constant smile made the experience a whole lot lighter :

I am a repeat customer of Wild Honey at Scotts Square. They have an interesting breakfast/brunch menu that leaves you spoiled for choice (but being a repeat customer meant I would love to see new additions!). The pricing tends to be a bit expensive but the serving is decent and fulfilling. Food looks and taste good too. So I won't make recommendations for a specific item on the menu, just go for what your heart desires! However, desserts aren't too interesting and is something that I would give a miss for. The place is always busy so you definitely need reservations (walk in isn't an option). Also they limit your dining time over peak period (e.g. weekends). It is not one of those places where you get a cup of coffee or champagne and chill around leisurely. Weekdays would allow you to sit around.Their service is good except that they are so busy that it could be hard to get someone and I have had orders missed out before, once in a while over a number of visits. You would see a good mix among its patrons but a good proportion is expats and their families. The seating might be a hit and miss as most are sofa like chairs with a low table. You might find it difficult to dine, or at least on the first visit
5
Food was amazing. Had a great time overall. But I had to wait for 15 mins even though I made a reservation.
4
Goof food, nice place to have gathering, but quite pricey. Can reserve through CHOPE and purchase CHOPE voucher,
4
My wife, son and I enjoyed the English and Canadian meals with pink flamingo tea, vanilla latte and cappuccino. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, and the service, personal, with attention to detail. The online discounted voucher was an extra perk.
4
Awesome place for all-day breakfast!! So many combinations to choose from~ Love the English Breakfast!! =)
4
It’s one of my favourite place for all day breakfast + wine. The selection of food is good and portion is big. I love it!
3
Not as crowded as the mandarin outlet, quite stuffy and no cool air . Nice chair. Food is acceptable but it seems lack of manpower
5
The Tunisian breakfast set is very special, you can hardly find elsewhere in Singapore. It's made of spicy shakshouka (onion, tomato, red pepper & chilli), chorizo, eggs, signature brioche & chopped salad. Highly recommended to the people who want to have a non-sweet brunch.
5
Superb food and great service from everyone from the entrance all the way to exiting the restaurant.
5
Food portion is very good, nice and comfy ambience. Staff is very friendly too. Definitely will visit again.
5
Wild Honey is a great discovery. Happy to find this restaurant by chance for a 9am breakfast. . Greeted not just by the hostess, but each staff member we passed by, we at once felt welcomed into this warm, friendly space. It features all day breakfasts from around the world and did not fail to impress. We all enjoyed a selection of : Princess Smoothy - rich, fruity treat, The Spanish - poached egg with chorizo hash, The St-Michel - crusted poached egg & spinach soufflé, Corsican omelet with feta & goats cheese (ok but not the lavender honey garnish) and Caribbean waffles with coconut and mango. Yum. Also serving lunch sandwiches, salads and free flow Prosecco brunches. Indoor and some limited outdoor seating in the balcony overlooking Scott’s Road. Packed by 10:30, recommend booking. One of the few non-hotel, non- foodcourt places, inconspicuously located on 3rd floor of Scott’s Square shopping center. Fantasti
4
i always enjoy to come and visit this restaurant. The ambience is really good. The food is good also. I will be back for sure...
4
Price is a bit steep but the food is pretty good, nice ambience and the service was also good. It’s a nice place to just chill and grab a meal
5
Service, food, ambience was great as usual. Always a trustworthy place for a brunch catch up, lunch meeting, or even tea break
4
One of my favourites for both dinner and desserts. The food is consistently high quality and affordable too!
4
We started with drinks which were coffee and tea, all very good. For brunch we had London breakfast, Boulevard St Micheal and I Love NY - were they any good? Oh yes they were, if your nearby don't give this place a miss even if it's just for a drink. NOTE it can be busy but worth the wait. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. We booked in advance
3
After waiting for Had to wait for a table for 30 minutes even though i had a reservation made well in advance. After seeing a few other groups enter the restaurant, i rechecked with the hostesss if my table is ready - only when she seen how displeased I am with the wait, she ushered me in to a table for 4 (i made reservation for 2). Before my friend arrived, the hostess also attempted to move me to a now avaliable table for 2 which i rejected. Not particularly impressed.
4
We revisited Wild Honey recently and were not disappointed. You still have to wait for a lil while as it's been always busy there, particularly on weekends. Which is a good sign that service and food of great quality. We ate the Hangover and Spanish Style Breakfast and Homemade Donut with Raspberry jam. All awesome delicious. Lean, the host and other staff crew were very accommodating too
3
It’s popular so be prepared to queue or make a reservation in advance. That said, the food was average at best. My food took at least 45 mins to serve, and came out cold.
4
Was here with my sister for a Sunday brunch, We tried the European and Brittany and they got to be my fav! Was a busy Sunday, but we got seated quickly despite walking in. Would recommend to make a reservation for your next visit. Service was prompt albeit realizing that the staffs were running around trying to handle different tables at a go. Would perhaps be better if they could add a few more staffs to help out as there was a few tables left uncleared for a long time. Very family friendly as I spotted lots of family w kids too, gotta bring my little nieces here the next time! Overall a pleasant experience would come back again another time
3
This is a very popular brunch place on orchard road. Long queue but we were able to get a place for two after about 15 min wait. The decor is good and the outside place on the terrace was pleasant. What we didn’t like:- seating was almost next to each other. We were almost shoulder to shoulder with the next table which was a bit awkward for both them and us. We understand you are doing well but you don’t need to pack us that tight.- we ordered the chicken and pear salad and the NY bfast (scrambled eggs and salmon). The food was ok but definitely not up to the “hype”. The salad had very little Chicken and eggs had very little salmon. - not good value for money.
4
Food was good, service acceptable, environment family-like so can be a tad noisy and cafeteria-like. Overall a good experience, though prices on the high side.
5
Try Benedict Egg with hot Tea Early Grey make your day fulfill of energy. Convenient location and good decoration.
5
Great food and ambience and always packed. Definitely going back again. Better to book to avoid disappointment.
4
1 portion can be shared by 2 in my opinion. We could not order dessert as we are too full. Ambience was good. But I find it a little on the high side.
5
They have an interesting international breakfast menu and reasonable prices for the quality of food and location.
4
Great food and excellent service. I ordered the gluten free Norwegian and it was delicious. Will be back!
4
Great selection of brunch choices for the family! Made reservation with Chope and got the assigned table earlier than scheduled appointment. Will surely rely on Chope to make reservations again!
5
Staffs are very friendly, prompt in attending to you. Better to have a reservation as it can get quite crowded. Good ambience and great food.
4
Environment was quiet and exquisite in the orchard area. Good for bringing a date out for a full meal.
5
I love Wild Honey! This is my favourite place for brunch in Singapore. The food is terrific. My favorite dishes are the Norwegian, the Spanish, the Corsican and the portobello road. The service is usually very good. There are two locations, I prefer the Scotts Square location as they have table service. They have excellent coffee and cocktails as well. Make a reservation, they often fill up quickly
4
Food was delicious... the portion was huge and value for money! Nice atmosphere for chilling and relaxing :)
2
Used to love having their menu but the taste of the breads and foods quality dropped drastically. Foods are salty and awful. Staff wasn’t attentive enough. Not recommended at all
5
As usual, excellent cafe for breakfast.. was crowded yet still enjoyed the privacy dining at the balcony section. Service top notch as always.
5
Love Wild Honey! Always good atmosphere and great service. Food selection is great, lots of options.
4
Highly recommend to have the Tunisian. It was well season and absolutely delicious. The tomatoes and chorizo are in perfect harmony, neither too salty or bland. However, service could be better.
4
Nice ambience. Great dessert. Delicious all day breakfast. Friendly staff. Keeps me coming back for more!
4
We came here for Brunch slightly hungover, and found the food great for our needs. The granola & fruit was a stunner, and the full english was cooked to perfection. The lady in the group was very pleased with the Norwegian breakfast. We will definitely come again
1
Do yourself a favour and do not go to Wild Honey Scotts square the quality of the food was atrocious. The cook sucked the flavour out it the food before serving. Truly remarkably ordinary. Returned the same dish twice and ended walking out. How can anyone stuff up toast and eggs. Service was courteous but entirely incompetent. Save yourself time, money and disappointment and go elsewhere.
3
Food was nice but over-priced. Service is bad for the price they charge. We had to place our order twice because the server who took our order, took it once ....... went away for like 10 mins, came back to ask us again to repeat our order.....strange way of taking order. When our main course was done, we were ready to order dessert & coffee. Just as we placed our menu down, a server came to ask if we wanted "our bill"........ we said "no, we want to order coffee". He walked away without asking what we wanted to order. Then mins later, another server came back, we thought was to take our order BUT to our surprise ....... He said "you wanted to bill?"So we gave up, decided to bill & leave to have our dessert & coffee at another out let.
5
We go to Wild Honey every year for Christmas brunch, and I've reviewed the food before, so today I'm gonna focus solely on the service. It was excellent. At the door, we were greeted by Rei. She was polite, friendly, and got us our table with no fuss. There was an error with our reservation (we made a booking for 5+2, but they had recorded 3+2). I was a mildly irritated and worried that we wouldn't get a table, but Rei was decisive, polite, and quickly remedied the problem with no issues, which is excellent. Her service throughout the brunch was also commendable - having been in the industry for 7 years (she mentioned), the experience tells.Dana took our order and she was brilliant. She was friendly, smiled a lot, engaged in polite banter, and was attentive throughout. Our wine was topped up without asking and we weren't disturbed unnecessarily. Sherissa and Eugenia also attended to us and they were excellent. Even the trainee staff were efficient and quietly working behind the scenes, but also dedicated and showed passion.Overall the service levels here were high, and it says something about the management, and the employees when motivation and pride in their work rub off to your customers. Keep it up!Food was good as usual
3
An underwhelming breakfast with a raw grilled tomato, undercooked potato cake and sausage and lukewarm, non-crispy bacon. Service was also poor. Asked for more toast and didn’t get it and asked for the tomato to be cooked and it arrived as we were leaving!
3
While the ambience was good for a breakfast date with my wife, food and coffee was not worth the price paid.
Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. Should have gone for the Tunisian instead of the English.
5
Enjoy The Food For Quality And Presentation Are Good.
Ambience Is Nice.
Staff Is Friendly And Attentive,
Service Is Excellent.
5
Very good environment and lighting to hang out with friends. Food was great as usual, coffee can be better.
5
Service is excellent and staff helped to heat up food when we requested. They also accommodated our request to do a 4 hours sitting
5
Wild Honey is consistently good in terms of food, service and ambience. I’ll definitely recommend others to come!
4
Made a reservation, was a wee bit tardy and was told to wait as they prepared a table for my group. I waited 20 minutes and still had no table but realised other groups were being seated before me. I went to check, and turns out they had forgotten about my reservation! It was infuriating, but as it was a one off incident for me as I visit this branch at least once a month so I could certainly let it pass. The service staff are friendly, attentive, and knowledgable enough to share the special Christmas menu. Food wise, I have never been disappointed with the quality and portions.
4
I recently ate at Wild Honey @ Scotts Square, and the food was delicious! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a good lunch place. However, it was definitely expensive, and I felt that the service was just OK. However, I would still definitely recommend it for the taste! Hope this helps
5
Awesome cafe style venue serving delicious western style breakfast and lunch dishes. I ordered their signature Rueben which was amazing and As good as ones I’ve had in New York. Service was better than the usual Singapore standard which is pretty bad across the board. The day we were there they were trialing a new coffee blend which wasn’t quite right and the manager was excellent about it and made everything right.
4
The staffs are really attentive, especially one of the Malay server serving us on 14 Dec, 4pm. Apologies as I didn’t get his name! Food was reasonable, ambience was nice, but $16 for a pot of tea was a rip off. Free wifi is a bonus.
4
While my eggs were a bit over cooked, the food still tasted great.
Decent coffee served as well.....
4
We had brunch at Wild Honey last Sunday. Good service and ambience. There was baby chair available for my friend's child too.
5
The Norwegian must try one, the salmon with avocado combination is very tasty! There coffee will nice smell with brew coffee beans!
5
Upon reaching the restaurant, we were met with great smiles and service. Food was fresh and tasty. Services was prompt.
5
This is the type of cafe that serves all day breakfast. I went with a friend for lunch and we ended up with the breakfast menu :). I ordered Portabello Road, my friend ordered the Canadian Pancake. The taste are very yummy. The Canadian pancake comes with three syrup - I am planning to order this if I come back here. We sat in the outdoor area, which was very nice design and ambient
4
This is the second time I have dined at Wild Honey at Scotts Square. The interior decorating is lovely, we had a table by the window with large plush, high-backed chairs that made it feel like a special brunch experience. The menu has something for everyone on it, including a large number of vegetarian selections. The prices are a bit on the high end, mains range between $20-30 but the portions are large.The one complain I have about the experience was the dining staff was very inattentive. They did not once come over without being asked, we sat for almost 30 minutes before they took our order (this was in prime Saturday early afternoon brunch hours) and then never returned until we asked for the check. I understand that the restaurant was busy, but you would think they would want to have greater turnover as there was a consistent queue outside.I would highly recommend making a reservation, I had one for noon and we were still not seated until 12:15. I think the wait without a reservation was considerably longer.
5
Good choice for a brunch place as always. Service is fabulous but the food isnt warm/hot at all when it arrives. Same as the drink. Still, i will be back agai
5
Brought my dad and brother here: they aren't fans of cafe food but I trusted it to have all day breakfasts that could pass off as proper mains... they loved it! Had the Corsican for myself and the tomatoes were, as always, fresh; the omelette perfectly done with just about the right amount of goat cheese. Do come with an empty stomach:)
5
Food was good and a good place to bring your SO on date or birthdays. Atmosphere would be perfect except for the noise within the establishment - or maybe it was a particularly busy day. Nonetheless, busy means very good business and good food so the ratings are justified and true! :
4
We were lucky to get a table straight away but I'd plan for a bit of a wait. It seems to be a popular place and I can tell why. Modern setting and menu. Large portions but on the expensive side for a cafe inside a shopping mall
5
Went there for a few times and they never fail to impress. Food was fast fresh and delicious! Ambiance was nice. Good place to have brunch or dinner after hard day at work.
3
Wild Honey is a hugely popular brunch place, but having been here a few times before, I'm still not massively impressed. Food is average, and service is slow. A cool place to be seen I guess.
4
It's definitely a place worth going back again and again. Good coffee, yummy dishes, and calm ambience.

Often the way restaurants like this differentiate themselves is not the food (they're serving breakfast, how many different ways can this be done?) it's the service.So when I asked for no mushrooms and an extra egg I expected the waitress to say no problem. Instead we had a 10 minute argument about the extra egg. I said I would pay for it. I said they were making a saving on the mushrooms which i was not having. She was not budging. She would not serve me the extra egg! I couldn't believe it. I insisted. She then said that she had to go and ask the chef!!! I can imagine the scene..."chef can you do an extra egg for a paying customer".....really? The chef must have looked at her as if she'd gone mad. You're doing 2 already for me, I'm offering to pay for a third...what's the problem?There is one snapshot is the problem with customer service at restaurants in Singapore.I got my egg. They didn't charge me. Not hard was it. Why the 10 minute argument
1
Stay away!!! They make you wait 30min even that they have tables available. I had to wait to be seated at the bar! And the whole time it was free.The service is very slow. My food came it was cold and the benedicts eggs only had very little hollandaise sauce on it.It is very expensive for that you get and offer little value for money. I don't recommen
3
Brought my friend to try the food. She wasn't too excited when her overeasy eggs didn't turn out runny. However she was later blown over by the poach eggs which I ordered. One thing to improve on, they need to use hot milk for the coffee if not by the end of the meal the coffee would have been too cold already. Now that really pissed her
4
It's been a long time since I've been to Wild Honey and I still think it's a great place to get brunch. Portions are pretty huge, none of us ladies managed to completely finish our individual portions. I really love the fluffy brioche served. I shared the Norwegian (which is basically eggs ben with salmon, topped with Ikura which i love) and the hangover with my cousin. Prefer the brunch option to the sandwich option in general.
5
My visit could not be completed without ordering the afternoon scone set. I always have to have this whenever I'm here! My husband on the other hand love to choose from a wide selection of food available from the menu
1
For a place that serves up breakfast you definitely need to do something about your coffee. And the attitude of your service staff. Popped by to buy myself a little pick me up the other day and was so disappointed. Ordered an ice latte ( asked for a normal one cause I know they serve it with frozen expresso cubes ) but the coffee was awfully acidic. When I asked for a change the server told me to add sugar... when I told him I'm not doing that he reluctantly made a new one but this time instead of the standard double shot he served me one that had less than that with sugar added. It practically tasted like milk and sugar. You are charging $8 a glass of iced latte please do it right, a glass of iced coffee from the Hawkers tastes way better that whet you are serving.
3
It was my second time. I really love the atmosphere but i was a bit disappointed by foods.. not so professional. my friends foods were also not nice than we expected. In my spicy opinion, it is just a good branded cafe
4
The quality of food was great. Tasty and excellent ingredients. However, the hot cappuccino and latte was not hot enough and didn't taste nice. $6.50 a cup. Not worth the amount.
5
Patronized Wild Honey Scott’s Square outlet on our anniversary. Awesome food, wonderful ambience and excellent service.
4
Always my favourite brunch restaurant at any time of the day. Manager was kind enough to allow me to change my reservation as I was late.
1
When asking to remove cheese from a dish due to lactose intolerance the manager said, “no substitutions for any reason or anybody.” We will substitute another restaurant for his arrogance.
4
Had a brunch date there with my girls. We booked in advance and had no issues getting a table on time. Their menu is quite extensive and brunch options are pretty decent. Service can be a bit slow though.
4
Wild honey is recommended by friend, and I had been here once. This visit is mainly to try out their dessert and it was tasty. The ambience was good too.
4
The Norwegian is as nice as ever. Pretty place for a cozy catch up with girlfriends too. Def a place to frequent.
3
Staff was not very friendly. Payment made but no receipt was given. Had to ask the staff for my Credit card receipt.
4
Enjoyable place to grab a nice dessert. Their Apple crumble with ice cream is my favourite. Look forward to my next visi
4
We decided to check out this eatery on the basis of good TripAdvisor reviews and were generally happy with it. Nice dining room, reasonable service and a sensible looking menu. We did think it was overpriced. On the other hand our food and others we observed looked like substantial platefuls. Coffee good also
4
All day breakfast is really satisfying~ Egg Benedict & English Breakfast is very satisfying & portion is huge!! =)
4
Love the food and the service in this place though the food pricing can be on high side. The brioche was yummy.
5
First time making reservation using Chope. Love it. Easy to use and even have 10% voucher to purchase.
3
Overall nice food but not amazing. My dish lacked seasoning and content. The location of this outlet is nice, on Scotts Road. Portions are decent and service is very polite but a little slow.
5
As usual service is excellent and food is al dente. Staff even gave complimentary birthday cake for my friend. Ambience was perfect
4
Though some staff weren't very friendly, the food was delicious and value for dollar. Would recommend if you're looking for good food but not excellent service.
4
nice environment, good food. Coffee's not great though. When it came to me, coffee was spilled into the saucer and the milk was not froth properly for flat white, there was almost no crema on the top.
4
Really enjoyed my brunch with a girlfriend at wild honey. Food quality and selection is excellent and delicious. The service was a little bit on the slow side and they were not very accommodating in terms of changing the way the eggs were cooked on specific menus but on the whole experience was wonderfu
4
I was staying at the nearby Grand Hyatt hotel where I used to have breakfast every day and wanted to try another place so I did. The Wild Honey is an elegant restaurant where you can get a good breakfast for a reasonable price (Singaporean prices are quite high) and I chose a classical slice of cake and coffe . Several dishes on the menu and friendly staff to complete the experienc
3
I arrived a little after 4.30pm (just me), the cafe was quite empty and I was shown to my table promptly and given a menu and a glass of water. The ambiance is good and the room feels lovely to be in. Some upbeat music is playing. You can sit outside on the balcony with plants and nice cane settings if you want. Going well so far. This place was recommended as somewhere to get good bacon, that’s hard to get in Singapore. The menu focussed on breakfast options, but it is licensed. I choose my meal from the menu and wait, and wait, and wait. There are 4 wait staff floating around doing nothing important from what I can see - I try to get someone’s attention but no luck. I look towards the concierge a few times, but she’s not looking either. Eventually, after what feels like at 10-15 mins I go up to the counter and the con concierge takes my order there...feels strange as if there was table service wouldn’t they take me back to table and take my order there. There are staff buzzing around us while I ask questions about side dish. I order and return to my table. I’m sure it should be table service?!When I come back to my table, the extra settings are back in place and my half drunk water has been taken away. And, the until now ‘nothing to do’ wait staff also seem to be about to sit another customer at my table!My flat white arrives - the tide is out (more than a finder width below top of a small cup) and the waiter with ‘trainee’ badge doesn’t understand my question about why isn’t the cup full. Fortunately the concierge sees me look after him as he leaves without answering my question, and comes over to enquire if everything’s okay. I’m not sure she understood my issue because she kept stating it was strong coffee. I don’t know, the cup was so low that I didn’t even taste it. They make me a fresh coffee - cup is full this time, but it’s no strong at all. A fraction too weak to fully appreciate. This was meant to be a respite from the heat and a very overdue lunch - I was hungry, but now I’m hungry and grumpy!My meal comes quite quickly and it’s fresh, clean, quality & tasty food. I ordered the vegetarian omelette with feta & goat cheese, and a side of bacon. I get enough bacon for 3 or 4 people and don’t eat it all. I was going to treat myself to a glass of wine/bubbles, but I think I’ll go somewhere else for that. I’m half way through a 3 month gig in Singapore. ...will I come here again? Mmm I’d come for the food, but the service isn’t something I’m in a hurry to experience again. On that basis no. PS: everyone else did seem to get table service, they even had bill taken to their table. I lingered a long time after eating, and guess what? You guessed it! It was a different experience for me.
4
Good
Did not read well the menu, so food not as expected
Good service
Good atmosphere
Will do it again
5
My visit to Wild Honey gave my partner and I a remarkable experience. The service provided to us is excellent and they served us with genuine service. I look forward to visit Wild Honey again.
4
A fantastic choice of breakfast dishes, good portions, something for everyone. Would highly recommend it.
4
Very packed on a Saturday afternoon. Nonetheless, service was great. This is a repeated visit for me, Food was great and we had a great time catching up.
4
Afternoon high tea was good value for money and can be reserved at SGD15++pp between 3pm-5.30pm. The set includes scones with clotted cream plus coffee/a pot of tea.
Service was just fine, and the place was almost empty.
5
Friendly staff and consistently good food. Menu was a bit confusing at first because of the layout but all in all okay
5
We all enjoyed our brunch choices - Belgian, Portobello Road, Brazilian Bread, and something I can't remember. I think I climbed farthest out on the limb, though, with the Flinders Lane. I have not had anything quite like it - quite liked it! Truly unique from the poached eggs to the avocados to the prata-like bread base. Spicy, gooey, crispy (yes, that's an oxymoron), TASTY. Don't be afraid.
4
I would imagine Wild Honey to be quite a mad house during lunch or brunch but on this occasion I visited on a Saturday evening and found the place to be quite empty, laid back and relaxing. Since there weren't many people at this time, service was prompt and food came very fast. Overall quite pleased with everything I've ordered - European, Norwegian and Reuven Sandwich. The children's menu was so-so, limited to basic meals though the portion was quite good sized.
3
First time dining at Wild Honey - went with a group of six friends for breakfast. The food was tasty but the service was very slow. Had to flag down server to finally put in order - food did not come out all at once - a few people had to wait for too long to get their order
1
Terrible experience. The host didn't take care of us, the manager behaved like we're an empty place. In the end instead of taking us to our table we were told to use a damn ipad to register for the queue! My god, what the *** was that?! Hostess left us all puzzled and some chinese people broke the queue and got in front, so in the end we waited for almost an hour and left. Useless place, take your money some place else. Thanks for spoiling our wedding anniversary
5
Start the Sunday with a good breakfast. The English breakfast is great especially the homemade bake bean. The ambient is nice, sitting at the balcony outdoor area having a good view of Orchard.
5
The P-formula worked well, the pastrami here is extremely good and you should not leave without having a taste of it!
Not the cheapest place in town, but certainly one of the best brunches in Singapore
5
Awesome food and atmosphere
Glad we could keep our seats till we finished our meals which was at least 2hrs since we have a late-comer.
will definitely be back again.
4
One of my favourites near Orchard Road. It is nice and quiet during weeknight dinner hours, and good ambience. Food is good and service attentive. Would return for sure!
5
What a great restaurant for primary school classmates, who have remained friends since. Now more than 40yrs later to reunite as mothers with our children too. Nice ambience, good sized portions, lovely presentation, great, friendly service staff and delicious food. All round lovely experience.
3
Went to WH for brunch today and ordered the grilled Rueben. Disappointed with the pastrami as it was overly grilled and too tough to eat. The bread wAs over toasted as well. Was looking forward to a great brunch but left the place feeling disappointed
4
This is a fantastic place to visit if you are looking for a restaurant with a nice and warm ambiance. However, my friend and I were given a table at the corner so the waiters and waitresses could not see us when we needed assistance most of the time. Food was alright too.
4
I just hosted 8 women here, and it was a perfect choice. Excellent food, well-paced service ( though, like many places in SG they could do with a few more staff), and comfortable ambiance. My French breakfast was a perfect mix of familiar ingredient served in an innovative way. :-)
3
We went there for brunch and It was crowded but luckily we managed to get a seat at their outdoor area.My fiancee ordered english breakfast menu and grilled beef sandwich for myself.To my surprise, the beef was tasteless! I loved the chewy texture of the sandwich though. I had a hard time cutting the steak with the cutlery they provided me with. Then I asked for a steak knife which helped on the steak / beef but not the sandwich . I think they should find a proper cutlery for their food. I tried the sausage from the english breakfast and it was mediocre too.Not sure was it because personal taste or the waitress recommended us the wrong food. But I dont find the food outstanding compared to any other cafe with similar concept

I made a booking via the Chope app for 4 adults and 2 children at the Scotts Square outlet. When we turned up for our reservation, we were ushered to a square table with 4 chairs at each side. I specifically stated that we have 2 children and need 1 baby chair. None was set up. To make it worst, the table allocated was squashed between 2 other tables with little space to insert a baby chair. Thankfully, the table next to us was done so they could join both tables together.Not sure what’s the use of making a reservation when the restaurant simply did not bother to take into account the number of pax. Do take note if you intend to dine there with young children. Food wise, it was average for the price we paid. Better brunch at other places
5
The food was good and very quickly provided. the wating time was fine as we booked the place beforehand.
4
This is not my first visit.
I always do come here for brunch food
Portions are big and nice
Service can be improved
4
havent been here in awhile; the food is still not too bad. the only downside was that the place felt stuffy, other than that, definitely worth going back again.
2
Nice place and food but very unfortunate the service from wait staff was bad. Ain't the place I used to like. Took our orders and even asked whether we want warm or cold water. But the water never came even after all the food was served. We asked 3 times and stopped the waiteress who took the drink orders and was told she only keys in the order and she doesn't serve !!!
4
Met my best friend to celebrate her birthday. We had the yummy Eggs Benedict and Steak Fries. Together with the 90 minute free flow Prosecco. The server that took our orders was very attentive and sweet. He noted that it was my girlfriend's birthday and arranged for a suprise cake, delicious chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream with the words Happy Birthday. It was a sweet suprise for my girlfriend. The server's name starts with the letter E and he did mention that he only started working recently and was from the Philippines. The servers were attentive in filling up our Prosecco without us needing to ask for refills.
4
There's a choice of alfresco or indoor seating. I chose indoor. The decor was tasteful and ambience was relaxing. However, after awhile, we actually found it a bit warm. The reservation was for hi-tea for 4. The hi-tea set at $15 was very reasonable compared to others available around the area. Tea selection wasn't Wide but the quality was great! The scones were just right, not too dry or hard and Did not crumble when cut. The coconut lemon cake was a huge slice and the sweet and sour taste complemented each other. In addition, ordered the portobello sandwich which was delicious too.Overall, the experience was great and food was good too. Value for money for the hi-Tea set.
2
The service at wild honey during this visit was horrible. The serving crew expecting their guests to assist them on clearing their plates. Not a very enjoyable experience. :(
4
Was first attracted to the outdoor seating while driving by town and decided to give the place a try! The outlook really lived up to expectation, and with the wide variety of breakfast menu, I would head back again. One thing to note was probably the lack of service-staff during weekend brunch time, however it was made up for the staff extremely good attitude
4
THe concierge at the Hyatt recommended Wild Honey which is in Scotts Plaza ,close to the hotel. Wild Honey provides a lovely setting and they do well what they offer. My only complaint is that they are completely unwilling to make any modifications to the menu to cater to either tastes, diets, or restrictions.
5
nice ambient. went for late lunch and its not crowded. we tried ala carte menu. "english" is good, with sausage, bacon, harsh brown, scrambled egg (can choose poach or fried or scrambled), bake beans and brioche. i like the thick bacon slices. and the bake beans are actually much nicer than i expected. this is not the usual baked beans that is sour and sweet. this one is savoury (not sweet at all) and the beans are much bigger than usual. We also had "Tunisian" and "European". "tunisian" tasted ok with chorizo (sausage slices) and 2 poached eggs in tomato based gravy, with 2 slices of brioche bread, but seems to be pretty expensive having the same price as the other dishes that has more. European was also nice, with prosciutto ham wrapping 2 poached eggs, placed on top of 2 slices of brioche bread
4
Waiting time for food is slightly long. Food is good. Staff can be more attentive. Coffee is slightly bitter.
4
I prefer the Scotts square outlet more than the one at Mandarin Gallery. More greeneries set up and there is an outdoor sitting as well!
4
Wild honey has a wide variety of all day breakfast, we had 4 different types of all day breakfast and it was great!
4
The food was good and the portion was consider to be rather huge. However, the only thing is that it's a little pricey though.
4
A very varied breakfast menu with loads of options from saboury to sweet. The food was fresh and beautifully presented with good service.
4
Ordered the Norwegian and really enjoyed the wholewheat broiche! Portion was just nice. Slightly pricey though.
5
Third time here and still loving the food and experience offered. Prices are little on the high side, but well worth it!
4
This restaurant is very near to wear I live. Having walked by Scotts Square for years, I never knew about Wild Honey. I visited with my son to have a late breakfast and was very impressed. We sat outside on a nice clear breezy morning. A little pricey but after all it is Scotts road. I will certainly go back
4
The food was good.. the outdoor seating at Wild Honey at Scotts Square could be a bit more spacious as I felt the tables were too near each other that conversation from other table could be heard effortlessly (without trying to even eavesdropping) Otherwise, service was not too bad.
4
Good variety of choices Good environment , good for friends gathering / couple The cappuccino doesnt taste good .
4
Loved the atmosphere, busy yet laid back. Great menu to chose from, lovely service. I recommend a table near the windows, less noisy.
5
Lovely venue, exceptional service, great staff, great food. Lovely place to go in Scotts Square. My friends and I loved it!
4
The all day breakfast menu is fantastic. The service is good, but can be a bit crowded on weekends so best to reserve a table!
4
happy w the service. I'm pregnant and I'm impressed when one of the staff came over and gave me a cushion to lean on :)
food wise, it was decent. mashed potat
5
Great food, wonderful service, exciting atmosphere and generally a fabulous place to take your family.
4
Good service and good food . Really impressed with their pancakes and waffles. Will eat again. Relatively pricey but acceptable for once in a while treat!
4
Love the dishes they provide and the juice is very good without ice! One of the waitresses is really sweet, as she noticed that my girl friend is pregnant so she's been very helpful to check with us whether we need order well done eggs for the dishes. However, the one who attended us regarding on reservation is not so sweet by telling us our table is already let go as we were late for 10min, come on it's raining heavily and it's pretty early in the morning and there were plenty of tables which were available, you could just get us one instead of telling us like this! So I had to rate your service as from excellent to average
4
The restaurant(Scotts Square) was crowded (understandably due to its' popularity) and felt warm when we were there for lunch. Perhaps, it would have been more comfortable if the air-conditioning is set 1 or 2 degrees lower. Food is excellent and ingredients fresh. A nice place to brunch on a weekend except they limit the seating time to 1.5 hours.
5
Wild Honey at Scotts Square provided the perfect ambiance for a lazy brunch! Menu was extensive to include light bites apart from the praise-worthy brunch items. Menu for brunch is very international and provides a huge variety catering to different taste buds. We had the signature eggs benedict (European) and St Michel's. The cheese and spinach 'scone' which came together with the french toast was delightful! Price was slightly on the steep end but justified for the food quality, ambiance and service
4
Wild Honey is a great place for breakfast. We've tried to get in on the weekends but it's always jammed. Not sure if you can make reservations. We went there on a Friday this time and got a seat easily. Lovely modern decor, great service and excellent coffee. I had the Reuben grilled sandwich. Absolutely delicious and so big I got to take half of it home!Will be back to Wild Honey.
4
Food and environment is nice. Enjoyable experience. But very crowded hence cannot stay too long for chit chat.
4
Located in a nice mall. Very chill place in busy-orchard road to have brunch. Reservations recommended, walk in customers on weekends seemed to have to be put on a wait list or wait for an available table.
food quality is great, coffee delectable.
5
Service and food was consistently good as always. The place has a good vibe that keeps me coming back, despite the price point ;)
4
food was fine. had the english and norwegian. i think the latter needed a bit more salt. service was prompt not necessarily warm. had to request for a bottle of water as none was served.
4
Air conditioning was not very cold, but food was amazing with pretty quick service. Would go back again.
3
Overall same vibe and comfy atmosphere, but with a revamped menu. Wanted to order the Ice cream sandwich which was oh-so-good before, but found it missing. Ordered the salted caramel breakfast (Beverly) but was utterly disappointed. No salted caramel satisfaction at all. Added a scoop of salted caramel icecream only to regret; as they changed the whole icecream. Its a pity, but I'll be coming far lesser now.
3
I thought the service could have been better. Asked to switch seats because the place was empty and I made reservations. Yet, they were unable to let us do so. The food was pretty small in terms of portions for the amount paid. I preferred Wild Honey at Mandarin
4
and was served nice spinach salad with fried mozzarella stick on top of it. (:/ ?) We went for birthday brunch and ambience is good. Also they prepared surprise presentation with the cake I brought. Thank you! Sensible service but menu was a bit misleading.
3
Have been at wild honey 8 times in last 2 years. It still is one of our favourites but the service is a let down these days. First our order was not entered in the system, then had to ask twice for water. When giving new plates or providing water, they just keep the stuff on your table and leave. Pour yourself, divide cutlery yourself and maybe tip each other for being courteous!Had Berkeley granola which was awesome. Corsican dish was nice and caribbean waffles great as always. Wife's chicken schnitzel sandwich was quite dry.I can still recommend this place for its food, but they need to improve their service to get repeat customers consistently
4
Went there to have dinner after so long. Food portion seem to have decreased in size and it doesn't seem to be as delicious as previous. However, still worth visiting
5
Received automated call to confirm my reservation. Was given a seat upon arrival. Food & service was good. Will visit again.
5
Have been visiting Wild Honey for many years now. Particularly like the service & food quality @ Scotts Square outlet.
5
we ordered something called a 'norwegian' that came with salmon, poached eggs with avocado and bread. although the avocado portions could have been greater, we loved the combination.we also ordered a 'i love NY' - a combination of scrambled eggs, salmon and sturgeon, with fresh succulent tomatoes and a bagel. this too was absolutely fantastic!there was a wait time of about 25 minutes when we showed up (a saturday noon)
3
I unfortunately found hair in my food. I have been here several times and this was my first experience with such an incident. They were terribly apologetic but I lost my appetite
4
came here for the waffles which friends had been raving about. came here on a saturday afternoon without a reservation. the place was half full and was terribly noisy inside - the noise is contained. fortunately they have tables outdoors which are so much better. i love the sun and the breeze (natural and fans) and the view overlooking scotts road. the service is slightly above average, some of the servers are better than the others. foodwise, the menu is pretty interesting, and the quality better than expected. the waffles are pretty good, although i do not particularly like the passion fruit cream and sauce. i like the presentation and berries. the spanish omelette is extremely yummy. i would recommend to share the dishes as they are rather a plateful for one person
5
My wife and I have been to both Wild Honey cafes at Mandarin Gallery and Scotts Square, we enjoyed both places in terms of food.While both places are equally popular we like Scotts Square because of the space outside and the sunlight; it's more refreshing than the darker ambience at Mandarin Gallery.It's a chill place for weekend brunch with the variety of food and drinks - my regular would be the hazelnut latte. I also like the wide range of tasteful magazines available for reading. They do take away the attention of looking at your smartphone, which is much therapeutic and soothing to your eyes. They brought back a sense of old fashion weekend relaxation. One can go with friends or can go alone and still find a nice time.The decoration was vibrant, music was appropriate, and service was prompt and friendly. It's a happy place
5
Visited this outlet for the first time and I was so satisfied with service from everyone who waited on my table. I couldn't finish my meal (strangely. The food was good and I normally finish what's on my plate) so the lovely waitress who handed us our bill offered to put it in a takeaway box for me, even without me asking.
5
Wild Honey was accommodative with my rather last minute change of booking from a party of 4 to a party of 8. I tried the special menu of Laksa flavoured poached egg which was good. Together with the very friendly waiting staff, our family had an excellent breakfast experience on National Day
3
Food and price was good. However service so so. Saw many young servers but had to serve water ourselves as could not get attention. It was also really very hot and uncomfortable even in the inside aircon area.
4
After an absence of about 4 years, we made a reservation at Wild Honey, Scotts Square, on a very popular, very crowded Saturday morning. The Corsican (an omelet of basil, feta and goat cheese and honey) was as tasty as I remembered it, but the sauteed mushroom side dish was not very appealing. We were more aware of the tables being closer together than at Mandarin Gallery. They still provide quite large servings. The servers were very polite and friendly. A very good value
4
Had breakfast here with my Wife and we both enjoyed it. This is a popular place and was bustling when we were there. Would recommend it!
5
Nice restaurant for celebration
Atmosphere is great.
Comfy & Cozy
Wish staff will be more attentive, as i was being charged $50 more as staff mistook my voucher as $50 instead of $100
5
Went to this cafe with a couple of friends and it didn't disappoint. Food is as good as I remember, with some changes to the menu
4
This is my second time at Wild Honey Scotts. Food is good as always. Ordered the Norwegian Salmon breakfast again without realising and it was just as tasty. Staff were also friendly and polite. Even though they were busy, was seated within minutes.
5
Nice food and ambiance, make reservations through chope in advance to avoid disappointment, place is very convenient just 5 mins walk from orchard mrt station.
4
As breakfast is my fav meal of the day, the menu selection based on breakfast type food (but full breakfast, mind you) was gratifying. Chose Full English Breakfast which was meat-heavy and therefore had to order a small side salad (NOT on menu) but waiter offered it at $3 for a weeny-teeny tub. Pretty decor too.
3
The menu is a delight to read, with each brunch-y option more enticing than the next (especially all the riffs on eggs benedict). Unfortunately, the dishes sound a lot better than they taste. Hollandaise sauce tastes overwhelmingly of butter (with nary a hint of lemon); fresh juices were overly sweet - even the grapefruit; and the steak frites was topped with an ice cold disk of her butter
1
We have eaten many times here, always good until now. All three dishes were all but inedible. I am not certain how they made bacon this poorly, but they did. The menu has changed, wonder if there were bigger changes. Would avoid for awhile
3
great brunch at Wild Honey, just they are little bit not salad friendly. they do not provide side salad. and the brunch comes with no side salad too....if they can provide that, it will definitely make an even lovely brunc
4
A friend flew in from Seoul and I chose this place for a good brunch. The food was delightful and the service friendly enough. However, as diners are given 100-minute slots, it's not a place to hang around for a good catch up over a lazy Sunday afternoon. Although I arrived early, I was asked to return only on-the-dot and when our 100 minutes were up, we were very aware of staff eyeing our table to make way for the next batch of diners. My friend and I hadn't seen each other for seven years, and we actually wanted a leisurely breakfast to catch up, exchange gifts and take photos etc, so of course we felt rushed because of the 100-minute limit.
5
Always a delightful place to enjoy a cuppa coffee or a hearty meal. This cafe has beautiful decor that encompasses an inviting and relaxing ambience. The food choices are aplenty and thr portions are good for sharing too.
4
Wild Honey is a great venue for a special treat. A great choice of dishes ranging from the healthy to the deeply sinful
5
The food is fantastic and consistent. Definitely the best brunch place in Singapore by a far stretch.
4
Attentive and fast service, make sure you come hungry as portions are big and moreish. Quirky decor and would be good anytime of day for a visit
5
It was at a quiet level at Scotts on a Friday evening, and the crowd was few compared to the other branch. Because of this, it felt like an exquisite restaurant with very cosy ambience. Will be very lovely for dates. Had their all day breakfast, and was very filling and satisfying even for dinner. Their range of desserts was delicious too, though their baked apple with burnt cream needs to be improved (when arrived the entire dish was already very cold, didn't feel baked at all). In all, would love to bring my family to try next time
3
wild honey has a good atmosphere and good menu. Great for a coffee or catch up with friends. Too bad for the service which brings it down a bit
4
Was there to celebrate our Friend birthday. Ordered a cake for our Friend and the waiter manage to bring to cake from behind to present to my Friend with a surprise. Thanks for the kind gesture. But it will be nice with a singing of Birthday song. Overall food was good.
5
My favourite place for brunch! Restaurant is always crowded and is best to make advance reservation via the easy to use online reservation system. Personally I prefer the outlet at Scotts more than Mandarin Gallery, just a personal preference. Service crew are always friendly and attentive to the customers. The serving used to be really big but now is just nice for one to consume. Worth visiting!
5
Nice and spacious, went during a weekday and was not very crowded. Ordered my usual Tunisian, good as usual. Tried the cold brew latte - that's fantastic! The cold brew came in the form of frozen coffee cubes, amazing flavour.Do make a reservation if visiting during dinner or weekends
5
Was there for brunch and was glad we made a reservation as the restaurant was full. Food was of great taste and quality. Service was efficient and fast! We asked for hot water to warm up our baby's milk and the server told us to pass the bottle to her for warming to prevent any scalding accidents for the little one. Thumbs up
4
i really like the place...cozy...good interior design...the food is good too...please try the breakfast menu..
4
Am surprised that they asked for the doness of the salmon fillet - it's a good initiative. Overall it's a good experience, the ambience was warm and inviting
5
Really enjoyed the food and service was great. Don't really have much to say but this thing is making me type at least 100 characters and I'm at a meeting so I have to pretend and look busy while I'm typing away on my laptop.
5
Good all day breakfast menu with wide selection of items. Nice ambience and relatively fast service.
3
Generally wide selection of brunch items. May not find your usual big breakfast here though for the regular tastebuds.
5
Came here for breakfast. Great service. Bagel was a bit hard tho and not enough cream cheese. I'm from NY where the cream cheese is piled on like crazy. I ended up with a mountain of scrambled eggs... who can eat that much eggs in one sitting?! OJ is good. Will probably come back cuz it's close to home
2
Food was great and service was terrible. For the prices they charge, they really need to improve the service qualit
3
Went to the outlet at Scotts and was disappointed by the quality of service and food. Whereas the experience at the original outlet at Mandarin Gallery was pleasant and has expanded since it was opened, the chain store concept is not working.
3
Have been few times at Mandarin Gallery and went to try the Scott's Sq branch. Overall was a mixed experience. The Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich was dissapointing and too dry. The Canadian pancake on the other hand was very good. Order the hazelnut latte Tasted sour and had to send back and was told oh it is because the hazelnut and coffee Taste. Gave up and opt for regular latte. Worst part bill was still presented with the Hz Latte and have to correct the waiter. Dissapointing experience all togethe
5
Usually have Brunch at Wild Honey but this time was afternoon tea with friends. Delicious drinks and food as always. This place never disappoints. As a Kiwi it was great to see pavlova on the menu so I ordered it for my American friend to try - what a hit!! She was still raving about it today, two days later
4
Wide selection of food. Nice coffee and lovely interiors. There's complimentary water provided unlike most places these days.
5
Excellent Service by staff. But the bacon was a little overcooked, which makes it a little tough. Overall food was good. Worth when used with chope vouchers!
5
Took my husband for a Fathers Day treat and both the food and the service exceeded expectations.
Many thanks. Much appreciated!
5
service need to be improve on attentiveness. foods and atmosphere are good. best to reserve beforehand.
3
Service was alright, food is on the pricier end considering the quality. It's the location I guess but crowded and noisy on a Saturday afternoon.
4
It was the 1st time I visited at the Scotts outlet. Packed as always but staff managed to serve well and never really have to wait for any service. Prices are not cheap and I felt the fresh fruit juice was so watered down. NO taste of fibre at all for the price of $9++
1
If you're Asian, you'd be asked to take a queue number because they are full. If you're white, you'll be shown to your seat immediately.That's exactly what happened to me. My partner wanted to try, and we walked in ask for a seat. The snooty lady at the door told us that they're full, and we needed to wait. Right after we got onto the waitlist, a pair of white male tourists asked the exact same question. Even though we were within earshot, the lady told them that there's space, and showed the two of them in. After a long wait (the missus really wanted to try the place, and it was "make the missus happy" day), they managed to wow us with underwhelming food and drinks for a high price. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It tastes like any other brunch restaurants, and there are plenty of those around. Presentation was severely lacking.The only way you'd rave about the food and the drinks is... if you need to justify to yourself that spending that amount of money spent was worth it. I'd rather pay a bit more and dine in a nice 6 star hotel. Wait a moment... having brunch/lunch/high tea at a 6 star hotel is actually cheaper. And better
1
My experience was terrible.I made use of a promotion that was provided by Chope on a complimentary 3rd main at Wild Honey Scotts Square.We went on Saturday as advised by the email. We ordered what we thought were mains, sandwiches, etc as they sounded like mains.On payment of bill, we asked the server if the 3rd main was complimentary. She didn’t even know what the promotion was about and had to go ask many times.Then she came back and said no it was not eligible, it was only eligible for the dinner menu.WE WERE NOT GIVEN A DINNER MENU.THERE WAS NO DINNER MENU IN SIGHT.AND ALSO I BOOKED THE RESERVATION USING THE CHOPE LINK so my beef is as well, wouldn’t WILD HONEY KNOW THAT I AM USING THIS PROMOTION AND THEN GIVE ME THIS MYSTERIOUS SO-CALLED DINNER MENU?! None was given so this is just a bad case of no one bothering to execute promotions properly. No wonder no one wants to go for dinner at the establishment. No one has a clue what to order.I am furious and feel extremely cheated by both Chope and Wild Honey. I think this is akin actually nearly to fraud
4
If you fancy big portions of quality brunch, then this is definitely the place for you. Tucked away on the top floor of Scotts Square is this cafe that not only serves hearty food, the service is usually prompt in spite of the busy dining crowd. Do make a reservation in order to not be made waiting!
4
Wild Honey consistently delivers. It is always a delight to dine here. The Apple crumble is always a treat. Will surely come again
5
Wild Honey tucked away upstairs in this shopping mall, but is worth finding. They serve excellent food and the service is terrific, went there in the afternoon and were spoilt for choice. Great atmosphere and decor - well done.
4
Had their afternoon tea set and enjoyed the scones. Lovely afternoon with a good ambience and service.
4
One of my fav place for English breakfast! Love the ambience in this outlet too. Perfect for a catch up w friends!
5
Excellent food, good vibes, friendly staff, top quality all around, every time. Wild honey is the place to go for a good brunch!
3
Bagels and scrambled eggs...sturgeon is so fishy. Eggs are so watery. Bagels are good but slightly hard. Expensive at $28 inclusive of gst but huge portion to be shared among 2?
4
Love the botanical theme of Wild Honey at Scotts Square, and the comfy armchairs. Also love the Norwegian and pavlova that I ordered.However, the service staff actually forgot about my order. My friend's order arrived and 15 minutes later, mine hasn't. So we asked and the staff realised then my order was missed out. It was a Monday late morning we went, and the restaurant is just half full. So we really couldn't understand the service lapse.
4
Food was up to standard, although our steak was slightly over done but it's no steak restaurant so it's fine. Service was the let down, you and the neighbors alike, need at least 3 waves before anyone responded. Strangely enough, it seemed like the eye contact was there but there was just no response.
5
Went with a few friends for a leasurly afternoon tea , a very relaxing and casual environment. We ordered their afternoon tea set that comes with scones and a choice of tea's/ coffee . Thouroughly enjoyed our experience with efficient serveres and an inviting ambience .
4
Finally get to try out this place during my 2nd half of the day off with my aunt and was informed that they had a new menu with details but not with pictures... Given the IT technology, you can view it via the QR Code Scan to view the photos on your phone to have an visual of how it'll look like.Am pretty surprised there's quite a crowd at 2PM on a mid week bvut maybe coz it's Orchard thus regardless what time of the day, there'll always be human crowd.Tried the recommended dessert, Pavlova with Lemon Curd, Pasionfruit, Jam, Mango & Basil by the waiter and we asked if there's any picture/actual item but he said nope, it's made upon order so we just take the risk.. In the end, am surprised that it tasted quite good as I thought it might be abit too sweet given that it's Pavlova but with the other sourish stuff to compliment the sweetness, overall it's great. Even my aunt who's not a fan of sweet stuff, ate almost 3/4 of the Pavlova.Would be great if in bigger group then we can try more items. Definitely hope to be back soon
5
I've been to Wild Honey at Scotts Square quite a number of times now and the sheer number of ways they are able to prepare eggs (and offer all these options on the menu) never fails to amaze me. In particular, I am a fan of the Boulevard St. Michel and the Tunisian. The are also sufficient vegetarian options on the menu for those dining with vegetarian friends
4
The food is good so strongly recommended for you to make a reservation first before heading down. Ask for a window seat so the lighting will be perfect for pictures!
5
Worth getting up early in the morning to have breakfast with friends there since there were not many people and the environment was kinda quite and comfortable. The portion of the food is quite big enough to cover both breakfast and lunch :P
4
Brunch available for the whole day. Portions are huge so be prepared for a drowsy afternoon. Food is tasty. 👍
4
Good experience as always. We would like to recommend. But need as early as possible to book the table.
5
Perfect place for hanging out even if there is a time limit during peak hours. The food extremely delicious, wide variety of food and drinks. Staff and manager all very polite
5
Came here for brunch with a friend who lives right on Orchard Road so the location was perfect. We showed up an hour earlier than our reserved time but the staff was nice enough to let us sit on the patio anyway. The resto was packed. My salsa egg tortilla was really good but I ordered it hoping it would be a smaller dish for me. I just have such a small appetite. So for everyone else I guess big hearty portions are great here. Will def come back.
2
Overhyped, Overrated and Overpriced.The food was just ok - nothing amazing. Atmosphere of the place was fine. Service was the usual Singapore standard, which means don't expect too much. Cleanliness of the place questionable. I'm talking about seeing dusts in my water and the slightly stained sofa. The one item from my meal that was good was the mushroom otherwise I felt a little ill after my lunch.Not worth another visit and I still feel the pinch for paying so much for this place. It's just not worth it
3
small portion sizes for the high price. Coffee was poor, I drank less than 1/2. I left hungry & disappointed.
4
Wild Honey was a favorite of mine when I lived in Singapore. Always loved the all-day breakfast concept. Went back last December and had a reunion with some friends over extended breakfast.There is a wide variety of internationally themed breakfasts. Canadian with bacon and maple sirup topped pancakes. The Norwegian with grilled salmon. The Californian, an egg white omelette. The Parisian, wonderful eggs Benedict on brioche. Or the Tunisian, a scrumptious pan of shashuka. All of them are good. So are the salads or charred ciabatta chicken sandwich.Had a sort of savory French Toast this time with roast tomatoes, ham, salsa and a avocado pate. Delicious as all the previous breakfasts.Service is, not unusual for Singapore, sometimes slow. But pretty decent this time. Make sure you book though, extremely popular on weekends especially.
4
I hadn't been back for ages (I kind of OD'd on it when they first opened as it was sooo good!) but Wild Honey continued to deliver lovely food, friendly service and warm atmosphere. It is a touch on the expensive side, and I forgot to ask to replace the brioche on my chicken schnitzel sandwich with nicer bread, but then this is Singapore, and high prices and food for those with a sweeter tooth are pretty much ubiquitous. My friends roast beef on rye looked gorgeous
4
Lovely hearty breakfast taken at lunch never fails. The nice buttery brioche. Savoury sausages and grilled tomatoes and chutney. Great combination and extremely filling.
5
Love the quiet environment for dining on weekday night.
Quality Quiet dining area for small or medium group of friends
4
Food was tasty as usual. Service was just the right amount of attentiveness that let me felt taken care of, but with enough room to enjoy the food and conversation.
4
We have tried different places all day breakfast and we always go back to wild honey. I like English breakfast.
5
Went there for Mothers Day brunch w family friends, 6 of us. Ordered 5 all-day breakfasts - English, Tunisian, Moroccan, etc (felt like United Nations), and some of their in-house non-alcoholic drinks. Excellent quality, taste and portion size for all dishes. Great ambience and service too
3
Was happy with my previous 2 experience at Mandarin Gallery hence decided to bring my family along. Tried Scott Square this time round but was utterly disappointed. We were placed on a sofa seating which was too cramped for 6 of us, and too Low for my elderly MIL. Requested for a table seating but staff was reluctant to help despite there were table available. The place was hot and stuffy. Service was ok except staff should be trained to handle situational request.

Have been to wild honey for a couple of times. Must say that the standard has dropped and the toast is no longer as good as it used to be. Not sure if it's that day or quality has really dropped. Well service is still as good and the place is well maintained and cozy
3
Went for dinner with family however, discovered that the food is more suitable for breakfast instead
1
Tasteless food and way too overpriced for it's quality. I am one who doesn't mind the cost as long as food tastes good enough. These people couldn't even get an omelette right! Besides, we didn't have a reservation, so were seated on the common table, despite at least 4-5 tables being vacant. When asked to move, the staff simply refused to even try just because we didn't have a reservation.Don't waste your money on this restaurant
1
Echoing the other poor reviews on here, I'd like to also make a note to the inflexible and unsympathetic management and chefs. Although your menu clearly states that you will do your best to accommodate dietary requests (as shown in attached photo), you actually do not make the slightest attempt to do this at all. And according to staff it is actually your policy not to change anything.Substitutions or special requests for taste preferences is one thing but it's ridiculous for that you refuse to even cook your eggs well done even for pregnant ladies. Haven't encountered one restaurant in Singapore that actually refuses to accommodate for this reason. And it's not that hard on your part, just cook the egg several minutes longer and there you go. Like another reviewer said, get over yourself. You're not some acclaimed chef or Michelin star restaurant (where most do actually accommodate food restrictions). I would recommend spending your money elsewhere especially given the volume of other brunch places in Singapore at a better price point since Wild Honey is way overpriced anyways
2
The food is good, but it's crazy that when I asked to change mashed potatoes to fries, they refused to do that. Because of this, I've rated their service terrible.
3
Quite interesting breakfast, nice atmosphere and design . We ordered a tea pot and were told that we can get only one tea cup ... which is quite strange if you want to share a tea pot

We usually patron the Wild Honey at Mandarin Gallery but because it was fully booked decided to come to the one at Scotts. Overall the food was fine with no major complaints, apart from the bread being a bit average. I am writing this review to inform other potential restaurant guests that the chef will absolutely not budge on how you would prefer your eggs to be cooked, unless you are having a fried egg.I asked for my eggs to be well done, this was met with the waitress having to ask the chef who flat out declined. I was aware that perhaps the chef has a specific taste for the dish and I mentioned this to the waitress that I am willing to compromise on the taste to ensure my eggs are well cooked. She declined and said the chef will not budge. If I am a paying guest and want my eggs fully cooked and have acknowledged that I do not care if it changes the taste, then what is the issue? It only requires leaving the egg cooking for a few minutes more, not impeding any other food preparation. To the chef...you are not Gordon Ramsey dude get a grip of yourself. Also important to note is that if you go to the Mandarin Gallery Wild Honey they will cook your eggs however you request after you acknowledge it may change the intended taste :
2
Food and ambiance were ok, however the aicon in Scotts outlet is not functioning well, we felt so warm throughout the whole dining experience, feedback to the restaurant and they offer to change seat for us, and apparently we are not the only one that complain
1
We arrived at this venue just over an hour before closing time. We were on a short visit to Singapore and tired and hungry after a long day in the city. We chose the restaurant because they claimed to do Gluten Free food, which I have to have for a medical condition and is not all that common in Singapore. As we arrived we were greeted by a very unpleasant waiter who simply advised that they had already taken last orders. We asked if he knew of any other Gluten Free restaurants and he told us to try another shopping centre, which by the way didn't have any venues serving food that was Gluten free. The staff here simply can't be bothered
5
Been here so many times. Never get bored of it. If You love eggs this is a must visit. But make sure you reserve in advance this place is jam packed
5
A more relaxing atmosphere compared to the Mandarin gallery's outlet. Boulevard St Michel (savoury French toast) is !
4
A birthday brunch for girlfriend. Reached earlier than reservation time, greeted by friendly staff who suggest we check out the menu before getting our seats.Food is good (Norwegian, English, Boulevard St. Michel) and tasty but portion is rather big for us. Coffee and latte is quite average.The Caribbean that next table ordered looked really yummy, but we were all too full to eat another mouth! Next time perhaps.Before that read some reviews on unpleasant experiences in the restaurant, was a little worried. But overall nice ambience and friendly staff (who promptly came up to help us while we were struggling with our wefie) on a Monday morning (public holiday) which let us start the day with a good mood
2
At tea-time with tables not fully occupied, the service staff prescribed rules such as what we MUST minimally order (one main and drink per person) and the TIME we are allocated (100 minutes) to complete our meals. Ridiculous and obnoxious.
3
In a relatively saturated market I wonder how long Wild Honey can maintain the throughput of guests. Keeping regulars would be good rather than tourists but perhaps they do not feel this is necessary?Pricing is more than most places, which is understandable given the prime location, so therefore the experience should match.I did not feel like that on this visit. Food was ok only, coffee was rather bitter and I suggest they check the pressure on the machine as no nice crema to coffee.Also disappointed that we had to argue on whether we had met their requirement for bookings of having to have a main and drink for each person. One of our guests ordered two starters with a value greater than a main, and we were asked to reorder. Come on Wild Honey!
4
A wide range of delicious brunch dishes to choose something for almost any taste preference. Everyone at our table loved their meal. Central location is very convenient. Funky decor. We'll be back!
4
Good atmosphere, good service, nice food.. To compare with new dinner menu, I prefer their usual all day breakfast menu more.
4
The restaurant has a good aesthetic appeal with fast and efficient service. Food was good even though it was a little pricey.
4
Food was usual, similar to the ones at Mandarin Gallery. Outdoor seating was pretty humid, should asked for the seats inside
5
Chope enables you make a reservation efficiently. Very easy to use . Promotion and discounts information will be provided.
5
Food was lovely!
The service staff were exceptional also; they brought us comfortably to a seat that we liked, allowing us to move, and catered to our strange food requests also with much patience :)
5
This restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend who used to be a chef in Singapore, so our expectations were high. The building itself has many boutique stores and Wild Honey sits on the 3rd floor. We didn't have to wait long for a table, though it was very busy and we're seated in the outdoor area, a glass walled balcony that overlooked the street. The staff were pleasant and helpful, guiding us towards various choices of drinks and meals. Among the three of us we chose the Norwegian breakfast, the Scandinavian breakfast and the Curly Kale Salad. Each dish was very large, and came swiftly. The breakfasts were both delicious, with perfectly poached eggs and succulent salmon - I would have liked some black pepper but there was none on offer. The kale salad was a beautiful masterpiece we all enjoyed our drinks of Queen Bee. Overall it was an excellent recommendation and we went there twice for breakfast.
5
Finding Gluten Free Options in Singapore has been a challenge- Wild Honey is an amazing gem!! They have options on their menu labeled GF, but I was also able to take a non-GF option and make it GF and it was sooo worth it! Who knew eggs Benedict with prosciutto could be so savory paired with a delicious GG bread? My pallet and stomach are very happy! The vibe is chill and local- and I feel completely comfortable just enjoying breakfast and the vibe solo. The staff speaks very good English. It's a bit tricky to find, it's in Scotts Square which is a small "mall" area on the third floor. The biggest debate is do I endings in the GF cake or not... Highly recommend checking this place out if Gluten Free and in Singapore!
4
Was staying at the Hilton next door and needed to find a place to meet friends. I've been to another Wild Honey on a previous visit and opted to try this. Hip place with very good food, ok coffee and attentive service. Atmosphere was chill and relaxed and exactly what we were looking for. Convenient location despite it being in a small but nice mall (Note: art store on other side of mall is worth a quick look)
3
We received a polite and nice welcome from staff at front of house. Food was served promptly, of good quality as usual. However, the female wait staff in our section was rather inattentive, staring into space or very focused on needs of a particular caucasian couple. Her peers were alot more helpful. Another female wait staff was incredibly eager to have us leave the restaurant. My plate was more than half full when she asked to take it away. We were far from overstaying so no reason for her to do that. Didn't experience this get-out-now attitude with Mandarin Gallery even though they had longer lines to deal with. Nonetheless, rest of the staff were still very good at their jobs and polite
5
Food was good. Loved the mocktails ! Had English breakfast , fantastic !
If only they could extend the hours till 11pm... the place is simply so cozy for friends to catch up
4
Great place with the good concept of everyday breakfast menu. All the breakfast dishes are good, desserts are excellent. We liked the bread basket and the range of coffee and tea. We liked the cozy ambiance too.
5
Best brunch in town! good recipes and good selection of drinks & dessert! Courteous waiters and well decorated.
4
Since discovering this place in March, we have been coming back regularly at least once a week. The all day breakfast selection is consistenly delicious and the good ambience and attentive staff a bonus.
5
After living in Singapore for three years, I can say this is by far my favorite breakfast place. I like this location better than the one in Mandarin Gallery/Orchard because it is more spacious but the food is top notch with a great selection of sweet/savory with some fusion in to boot. The coffees and teas are delightful as well as the juices. If you are visiting and want a great breakfast place, it doesn't get better than this
1
Eaten here before thought it was good. That was in2016 April . Decided to take. Friend for a treat this time. The food was trrrible. Stale and stordgy. I even returned the breakfast potato couldn't eat it ..... disgusting. Never again. Bad experience
4
I love the hot chocolate and their sandwiches. Ambience is always quiet and nice. My Wife and I frequent this place
5
The place was very spacious and good for families with children. I could let my 7mo baby sleep in the stroller next to me and staff is extremely friendly.
3
Group of 4. Reserved through Chope. It was a breeze redeeming the pre purchased Chope vouchers.Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Ordered English breakfast sets, a Steak sandwich and Salmon Fish, starters and some cocktails. Food portion was quite huge, enjoyed the Steph's steak sandwich but felt the English breakfast sets were over rated. Cocktails were pleasing to the eyes and sweet to the tongue. Somehow, I still prefer dining at the Mandarin Gallery branch even though it's much more quiet here. Service maybe? Good waitresses but lousy manager. She was all smiles and ready to attend to two separate tables with Caucasian men diners even though she saw our waving hands, she clearly ignored it. It didn't happen once but twice at the same visit. Such annoying behavior...
5
From the moment I walked in to the time we left, our servers were lovely. I decided to bring my Aussie visitors to Wild Honey because one of them is gluten intolerant and both are very healthy eaters. But i didnt want to bring them to a health food store, I wanted to impress them with a fab menu and impressed they were ;) Eventhough we ended up having a simple breakfast (she had granola, he had GF and DF scrambled eggs and bread and I had the awesomest quinoa couscous salad ever), they loved the great ambience of the Scotts Sq outlet. Oh and they really enjoyed the juices too. Always good food and good service there.
5
Wild Honey didn't disappoint! Their food was as delicious as ever. I tried their special today a duck confeit with Grapefruit hollandaise sauce. Spectacular !
5
Excellent food that is also healthy and filling. Relaxing and bright ambiance; and service is fast, efficient, and with a smile!
5
Great menu with lots to choose from including lots of vegetarian options. Food was delicious and the restaurant very nicely decorated, best breakfast we've had in Singapore, we will be back!
4
For a good serving (big) portion of brunch (and nice food too), combined with nice ambience, this place can't go wrong.
5
Great ambience and great food. Service staff were polite. Not many diners at 8+pm hence the place was rather quiet and a good place to chill after a day's work.
4
Reliable brunch food but always crowded. We had to leave as stated and it wasn't pleasant. Food is slightly higher price
4
Great atmosphere but a little pricey. For those who are not into breakfasts, it might be a little difficult to pick something you fancy. But the portions are good enough for two! Overall still a great experience. Hot cocoa is yummy!
4
Wild honey has a fantastic menu for Breakfast, none compare in Singapore. I dined with 5 friends, we were seated promptly and the food was delicious. The only issue for this visit was that the table service was a bit slow. This is unusual for Wild Honey at Scotts Square, as whilst they are always busy, the service is still usually good. Perhaps last Saturday was once off
4
I have dined Wild Honey a few times and the quality of food is consistent . We ordered Norwegian, Spanish Hash and Tunisian . We are pretty pleased with the food . The food was served on a warm plate and it was a thoughtful gesture . I enjoyed my dish - Norwegian . I particularly like the thick wholemeal brioche. The butter which I requested for was not good at all. It tasted too plain . The coffee was served warm , which turned cold after a short while . I asked for it to be warmed up but the staff said that they did not have a microwave, so there was no warm to heat it up . A table of 6 ladies was loud. They were there on 21/3/17 , Wednesday 12pm. Their voices and laughters reverberated through the entire restaurant . They behaved as if they were in a pub rather than a restaurant. I asked to be seated far away from them . The junior staff led me to a less noisy table which I appreciated . Shortly after , the manager approached me and sorted of implied that there was nothing much he could do about the inconsiderate guests. However, he added that he could approach the noisy ladies but he had to highlight that I was complaining which I was agreeable to that. It was fortunate that their volume decreased and I was allowed to dine in peace . I do not find the approach of the manager satisfactorily . He seemed to be afraid to face a sticky situation and would rather avoid it . Would I go back again ? Yes , of course ! For the all good food and nice ambience .
5
...Chope should include an expiration date on the gift certificates they issue. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was relaxing, although sitting in a spot where there wasn't an occupied table next to us would have been even better. The service was excellent-very friendly staff, quickly helping us when we needed it, and food delivery was quick and both dishes came out simultaneously, something we don't often experience here in SG. I would definitely return. Well done, Wild Honey.
5
Their eggs are awesome. Service is always impeccable. Wine is also very reasonably priced. Have never been tired of this place.
3
Foods wise very good but personally judged that overpriced ! Staffs at there very helpful and good atmosphere :)
4
Quaint ambience, lovely food offerings and polite staff. Unlike most new cafe joints, the food portions were worth the price. Ensure to make a prior booking on a weekend or you would be left disappointed!
4
Staff were friendly. The environment was nice, cosy and comfortable. It is also a place suitable to for family gathering. Liked the decoration and ambience.
4
Whilst exploring Singapore I headed for "Wild Honey" for one of their renowned All Day Breakfast and a refreshing Iced Latte. Wild Honey (located more or less above the Lucky Plaza) at Scotts Square Singapore has great decor and ambiance and serves really great breakfasts... It's close to a full English breakfast but not quite as the baked beans are an Asian version which are not a patch on traditional Heinz Beans. The cost of an English Breakfast was SG$26 (about GB£16) and it was worth it. The Iced Latte was superb and was SG$7.50 (about GB£4.50). Service was very good and I certainly recommend paying Wild Honey a visit
5
A perfect brunch date for my daughter who is turning 21! The Mimosa was the perfect drink which led to a gastronomic celebration with the choices offered...highly recommended
1
OK, so if you are from Singapore, the subject of this review may not surprise you... And who knows, they may be better than some. But to be honest, when the attitude towards customers is so based on policy that it almost demonstrates contempt towards customers, I am afraid it can't endear me to the place. When we arrived, my chair was covered in food stains, so I asked for another one. They duly took away the dirty one - but getting a replacement was more troublesome (i.e. they just forgot and left me standing until I chased again). The real fun started when we ordered though. My wife really wanted French Toast (this is a brunch place after all) but is allergic to banana. The main menu has french toast with banana (their other branch does it with a different fruit) and the kids menu has plain french toast. We asked for the adult version but without banana. Whilst we were told by the first waitress that the banana could be removed, they were not by policy allowed to do so and replace it with another fruit (perish the thought!). However, we were allowed to order the French Toast on the kids menu (which comes without banana). The manager however, said the banana could not be removed, if it could they wouldn't replace it with anything else on the grounds of policy and policy also dictated that an adult could not order from the kids menu. So essentially they were saying that yes they had french toast and yes they understood we were happy to pay full price - but no, it would be outrageous for my wife to be able to have it. A punishment for having an allergy to something on their menu perhaps? In the end, the manager said he would allow us to have the kids menu version but we needed to know it was against policy and would not happen again. To even say this (never mind the farce that went before it) shows a complete lack of understanding of any element of customer service - to the extent that it is almost as if the manager had been trained to annoy. To add insult to injury, I asked them to make sure the steak in my steak sandwich was not fatty when I ordered. I was told firmly that their steak is not fatty. Once it arrived and I had removed the fat, I was left with about two thirds of the meat... By then, I knew not to bother raising it with the manager for fear of being reprimanded of course. I was, after all, incredibly lucky to be given the privilege of giving them my money in the first place...
2
Quite disappointed. Ordered English and Canadian breakfast. Bacon is tough, bread serve dry. Price on higher side. Food presentation is goo
4
Am particular about potatoes and mushrooms... my serving came with some burnt and the mushroom was not as savory as i would like it to be. The baked beans matched well with the toasted bread. In summary - generous serving, nice atmosphere and polite/friendly service
3
Wild Honey used to be my favourite brunch spot. Brought my boyfriend to try the brunch but the standard of the food kinda drop or probably they're busy? We both had "English", the potatos were quite hard and the scrambled egg tasted abit bland. The rest were quite okay. Had ice cream for dessert and it's really very sweet personally.
4
this is my 2nd time of visiting the restaurant the environment is good and the staff is friend. The only thing that need to improve is, they should come out some special dish.
Good Job team
3
Lights were shining too brightly. Seats were of different sizes. Service was good. Food portions could be larger for the price.
4
Service and ambience of the place was good. Food was not bad but the portions are huge. Probably 2 will be able to finish one main course.
5
The services are also good, no strict dining duration limitation in fact. Will drop in this lovely place again!
5
Excellent waffles and fresh orange juice. Norwegian dish was superb. Latte, impeccable. Ambience- lovely view. Attentive service
3
Been to wild honey multiple times for brunch, however over the years their food quality have dropped.Went to Scotts square outlet for brunch 2 Sundays ago. We were seated at the comfortable sofas by the window. However to my great disappointment, that area was covered with dust which pop out like an eyesore. See attached pictures. You need to maintain better hygienic, it just spoilt my appetite completely.Will need to think twice about returning again for my next brunch. A plus note that the service was attentive and swift.
3
My folk and Sia had Iced latte, which is a special concept of iced cubes and delicious milk. I had a flat white which was strong and the barista did a great job in pressing the coffee. Food wise, I had a breakfast meal consisting of Frenchtoast with an avocado cake like substance and bacon( could not be replaced) but I thought the frenchtoast could be a little more savoury. Loved the Verandah atmosphere, but we were a little neglected by sitting outside. Perhaps a button to call the service staff from the outside would be good. Will still go back definitely, to try the sweet french toast or stick to the usual salmon eggs Benedict's on Brioche toast.
3
Was there for breakfast with my family and we were told that wild honey has a no-sharing policy (ie each of us should have our own breakfast set), so we were abit surprised. We dined at wild honey many times before, but were not told abt this previously. We shared the food because the portion is huge for us. I did inform the waitress that we were sharing food but she did not comment either. If there is indeed such a policy, pls make it clear to diners
4
This restaurant is situated in a mall and is easily accessible by public transport. It is a vibrant place with a pleasant atmosphere. The staff is efficient, friendly and helpful. The English breakfast is excellent, but the portion is far too large to finish. The coffee is very good and a second cup goes down equally well. Breakfast here is an enjoyable experience which will be repeated in future if the opportunity arises
4
The food is awesome here. It's a shame they have taken to playing loud pop music and ignoring diners, but this tends to be quite normal for restaurants in Singapore over time, so not a huge surprise :)Still a great brunch. The Tunisian is superb
5
Food was good and lovely ambience as usual. Extensive menu selection. Will visit again soon. Love the fact that I can make reservation prior to my visit
4
good place to eat brunch with friends, though food is quite pricey. my kid loved e kid's waffles too
5
A really diversed choice of food! V delicious and definitely worth the money! Will come again next time :)
5
The range of breakfasts are huge. It's my 4-5th time visiting and the quality of the food is still as good. Prepare an empty stomach if you are visiting!
4
A good place for breakfast.
Nice ambience, food is not too expensive.
Good place for a Sunday morning breakfast.
3
Food is too expensive. Bill for 2 people can easily be $60 and above. Ambience is good though. Will not be visiting again.
5
wild honey is a must try again and again because the dishes are all so yummy! love the salmon dishes
4
So great food for an early morning breakfast. We all ate well just so annoying that you have to continually chase the waiters. I got the impression that they didn't expect so many people that early in the day even although we had a booking. Pancakes were excellent, mains were cooked to perfection and quality quality ingredients. A TOP tip though, if you order eggs as for the salt and pepper at the same time otherwise your eggs will be cold by the time the salt and pepper turns up! Great location, great food but so-so service.
3
Nice ambience for gathering, wide selections of all day breakfast but certainly not value for money.
4
Went twice with different gangs of friends for birthday celebrations. Environment is comfortable, foods served in big portion & tasty! Waiters n waitress are mostly frenly & approachable! Limited dining time during peak hours, esp weekend! Advise to do reservation to avoid long queue & disappointment
4
Love the way they do up the cafe. But seating is a problem because we are always full and we need to call to reserve. Food are ok nothing really special. Drinks are ok too. Prices are consider reasonable
4
A nice place hang out with friends and family. Nice atmosphere. Reasonable price and come with big portion of food.
5
I loved the food, coffee and service. I had a baby with me and there was enough space for the stroller and a high chair. Definitely recommend!
5
The staff provided excellent service from the moment you enter, offering to take photos and constantly checking on your level of satisfaction. The manager was friendly and made appropriate small talk which brightened up the mood.
5
We had been served by wonderful Service crews and managers on the ground, they will patient in attending to our needs.
5
Wild honey is always in our list for weekend brunch. The warm sunlight from the big glass windows, cozy lighting setup. It is felt like home.
4
Nice quiet cafe with an extensive all-day breakfast menu. We had Tunisian and Brittany. Both are well prepared and rather delicious.
4
The customer services was excellent! Great smile and welcoming staffs, with romantic dinning experience.We are seated at the last table of the out door section, which the wind on that day was a little too strong. Perhaps better sitting arrangement could be made.Anyway, everything was beyong my expectation and will highly recommend to my friends. Thanks
5
It was not my first time here but my first time trying the Boulevard St Michael. It was a perfect combination for me. French toast with bacon, baked eggs soufflé and deep fried poached egg. It was my first time trying the fried poached egg. However I guess due to the way that it is cooked the yolk is semi solid and no longer flows. But this dish is different and really good
4
Hello there, this is my fourth trip to Wild Honey (Scotts). I haven't done any review before and only doing so now as I just checked my email. I can't remember what I had ordered during my past 3 trips. But one thing for sure is that all my trips to Wild Honey (Scotts) were enjoyable. The food is good, the service staff were friendly and nice, and the ambiance is great. This is the first time I brought my boyfriend over for a Valentine's meal. He got himself an English Breakfast and liked it a lot - the scrambled eggs, sauteed mushrooms and brioche were great. I got myself a Scandinavian and I really liked the salmon and asparagus a lot. Serving was good. Although it was kinda pricey, the atmosphere and its good qualities made it worthwhile I guess! Good place to go to once in a while, whether with friends, family, or partner. :)
5
A quiet place to relax after work with your loved ones. It wasn't crowded and noisy as compared to the branch at Mandarin Gallery.
4
Went with husband and sister in law and husband. No fuss seating, food nice and big portioned and pleasant atmosphere.
5
One of the hottest spots all day Saturday and I can understand why... I was introduced to Wild Honey about 2 years ago and I've been a regular ever since! Please remember to make reservations at least a week in advance, otherwise your Saturday meal will more likely be Tunch, rather than Branch!All their breakfast items are worth exploring, just come every week and tick off the items on their menu... hearty breakfast at its best!An excellent selection of drinks to accompany your meal and, if you so choose, nothing like a tipple of alcohol to start the weekend... hick
3
Went there for lunch. I had the Spanish hash, my daughter had the kids meal eggs and bacon. We also ordered the pancakes. For the price you pay, I would say the food is just ordinary and not worth the money. The bill amounted to over $50. Ambience was nice though.
4
I had asked my nephew to suggest a good place for breakfast, close to our hotel. He recommended this one as it was right next door. We went at 9.15 am and the place was already half full. They have a really great breakfast selection and we enjoyed what we ordered very much. The service is prompt and friendly
5
Love the variations of dishes, perfectly made all of them. However I must comment, I find it disturbing that they served the dessert first and the waiter seemed upset when we refused to have our dessert as our main course LOL anyways. other than that I loved it, and would defo come bac
4
We enjoyed a family brunch on a Saturday. Love the fascinating breakfast choices! Coffee and tea selections are also good. The place has a comfortable feel to it, though the living-room-like chairs at some tables are not that comfy for tall people. Service needs to improve. Three of us dined together. Server brought two meals, then the last one (our daughter's) took another 10 minutes to arrive. This is unacceptable, but sadly all too common in Singapore
5
This is my second time visiting Wild Honey at Scotts Square but first time using Chope. i made a reservation through Chope one day in advance and on the next day, i received an email to purchase a voucher. I bought it and used it on that day to pay for dinner and it worked (real, not fake and hassle-free) Really great experience at Wild Honey and the restaurant provided good service, collaborating with my friends to surprise me with the birthday cake. Thumbs up!
2
Asked us if we preferred bar seats or table, table having to wait 15-30mins. We said bar seats, but after being ushered to our bar seats, we asked if we could have coffee and be moved to tables when they are available. There were about 10 bar seats and ALL of them were empty. Ryan told us with a straight face that it was "fully booked with back to back reservations". Since that contradicted what the door receptionist said, I told him "but I thought...". And he validated that, and said we have to wait for it. That makes his "fully booked" story BS. Then I asked if we could order coffee and wait for our table seats, seeing that none of the bar seats were taken up. He said no, and made us decide if we want to wait. We did, but was uncomfortable with the experience. The whole conversation was polite but unsettling given his response were quite hard to understand. We were seated 15 mins later after waiting outside. Service did not drastically improved after we were seated. Ryan took our coffee orders and got it wrong. Food was horrible! We ordered English and Salmon. The potatoes in the English set were not for consumption. Part of the bacon were fried too much and it was concrete hard. The rest were fine. Poached eggs and scrambled were great. Overall, not going back.
5
It has been quite a while between visits, but everything is excellent as ever. It is a little pricey for a breakfast but well worth it.
5
I ordered the pancakes with bacon. Pancakes were fluffy, tasty, buttery, perfect! The service was also excellent.
5
The brunch selection was good and portion were sufficient. Although it was a little pricey but the food was of good quality!
5
I think it's the best brunch in singapore. The food portion is enough and very delicious. Price a bit high but it's offset by all other things
5
The place was cozy & surprisingly not crouded on a weekend! Will deifinitely go back soon! The food is value for the money!
5
Awesome food and worth a pay of visit!! Must visit the branch at Scotts instead of Mandarin Gallery.
5
Nice ambience, decent service, comfortable seating to kick things off nicely. Its an all day breakfast joint so make sure you have the right expectations. All the food we called for was good. Prices on the higher side
3
Food is great! Wide range of dishes as well. But service is horribly slow, ambience is noisy and service can be friendlier, given the high prices we're paying.
1
Very bad customer service. First visit there and is gonna be my last visit for sure. Bread was also as hard as rock. My friends and i were disappointed, given the amount of price we pay for the meal; customer service and food quality both were not worth the price at al
4
We made a reservation for 6:30pm, but reached early, so the staff did allow us to start dining earlier. 6pm on a Saturday was a good time because the place was almost empty! Food was a good sized portion, and ambience was great though the music got turned up when more diners came in. The staff who served us at payment (presume she is some sort of manager since she wasn't wearing the typical waitress garment), had a perpetual black face and nonchalance. Not quite the kind of person you would want to end a meal looking at.
4
This is definitely a nice place for brunch with it's wide variety of food. It is a nice gesture of the waiter to try and surprise my friend with the cake when I mentioned it's her birthday. However it's always crowded over the weekend, hence advance reservation is recommended to avoid disappointment
5
Love the service and ambience. Great place to unwind. But wish there was a great selection of magazines.

Had Full Works &Norwegian shared between me &my dining partner. The portions were huge and kept us really full. Particularly liked their bacon as it wasnt salty nor hard! Thumbs up for that.
5
Tunisian breakfast was very good, worth the price.
Atmosphere was excellent. Bit pricey but worth to visit next time.
5
Prompt service, cozy environment & great seating arrangement and wonderful brunch to start on the 1st January 2017!
3
Nice ambience but nothing to wow about. A place for those who are willing to spend for something not worth. Food is not hot but warm. Potato and mushroom on sides are cold and hard potato. Not what I would have expected. Even if I'm willing to pay, it is definitely not a place for me. Should strive to improve or else..
2
Definitely not worth the money. Poached eggs were over cooked and the staff did not seem to know about the food when asked
1
Food are mediocre and charge at top price. Service was okay and nice environment. Overall good for photos and sharing. So you pay for that then good food, environment and decently priced
5
We had visited WH orchard road in August last year. This restaurant offers the same menu. We were not disappointed. An innovative and tasty menu on offer. All the meals are presented with passion and great quality. We hope to be back soon. Loved the espresso. It was thick and value for money. They ask you how you would want to have your salmon prepared. Pretty good!! A Fabolous place!
4
Good food and service. Slightly overpriced and there is Dining time limitation. Always long queue during weekends so it's better to make advanced booking.
5
Wild Honey at Scotts Square never fail to disappoint. I made a reservation on this visit and my guests and I were very quickly ushered to our table. Service was quick and efficient as it was a late brunch, with the friendly staff introducing the specials.
4
Very nice decor and ambience. Food serving was appropriate and tasty. Service was quite responsive and serving of food was quite prompt. Overall well done!
5
Looking for all-day breakfast out of the typical Western style? You can find any international breakfast from between the Channel to the Mediterranean. Relaxing upholstered furniture and interiors set you in the grandeur of colonial period yet modern.
5
The food is amazing and of great quality. Service staff were friendly and helpful and prompt in providing service!
4
Didnt have to wait long for dinner. The steak was ordered in medium but was a tad too dry. Prices are abit too steep but acceptable.
5
Loved the idea of all day breakfast. We visited it at 12ish and enjoyed our late breakfast and they have options for kids too. Would love to visit again before leaving singapore
4
Wild honey at Scotts never fails to excite. I returned after 6 months and found that the menu was updated. Love the food!
4
probably the best pancakes in singapore yet after Fremantle. Could be even better if I can change the bacon that came with it to something else #notafanofbaco
4
On my last day in Singapore, we decided to have brunch here. We arrived upon opening and there was already a line. PROTIP: make reservations so you get seated immediately.The decor and the food plating was IG worthy. But the atmosphere was relaxed. Good for the family, or friends, or couple dates. Their all-day breakfast selection was substantial and had generous servings. Good enough for sharing, which we did. We had the Spanish breakfast and the chorizo in the hash was outstanding.The Canadian had really fluffy pancakes and the candied canadian ham was good. The British breakfast had all the components of the ploughman. Their sausage and mushrooms were delicious.Price ranged from 20 to 29 Singapore dollars for the breakfast entrees.

I had good experiences of the food and service at the Mandarin Gallery branch but can't say the same for this branch. I went into the Scotts branch hoping to get hot and freshly made all day breakfast but ....The new menu was no doubt exciting but when the food was served, I am afraid I cannot hold the same excitement. Ordered the Portobello Road and the brioche was cold, untoasted and does not taste freshly baked either. However the rest of the dish - the poach eggs and hollandaise sauce were still not bad...palatable. My company ordered the Brittany and that was served cold too. The staff got our coffee orders wrong but changed it obligingly. We felt like we were rushed to leave because there were more people coming in through the door for lunch.I would go back to the Mandarin branch one but sorry not this branch ...One thing they got right was the ambience with cozy sitting areas with eclectic collection of décor which gives the place a homey feel. Wished the food and service was better
3
My second time visit Wild Honey. Service improved but food quality dropped alot. Ordered the English Breakfast for myself. The baked beans was hard, sausages tasted weird and the potatoes was overcooked. Food was big disappointment, especially when I am looking forward to a good meal for my special day.
5
The food was satisfying and the portions were generous and filling. There is good value for money.
The manager, Ryan, was amazing. His service was impeccable. He made sure everything was in order in our table.
5
Love the food. Not my first time here. Love the decor and the ambience as well. Will keep coming back.
3
Nice ambiance, good food. Service is decent but nothing special. Best for breakfast or brunch though the menu works for any hour. Try the Tunisian
4
I've eaten here a few times when I'm in Singapore for a holiday and I have to say the food is really good and the setting of the restaurant has a nice feel to it
5
We all enjoyed our delicious brunch choices. There is something for everyone! Great coffee too! This Wild Honey feels a wee bit more upmarket than the one in The Mandarin gallery. glad to say that the food is just as excellent and service is exactly as attentive as one needs
4
I love the food and ambient. Just that the serving staff are not attentive to customers and they don't refill hot water to my tea (pot).
4
U must make a reservation and if the automated system does not allow to record your international number, dial '2'and speak to them directly. Overall a great place for Brunch, especially if you like Pork :) The servings are of good portions and the environment friendly. Its very close to ION Orchard and the Orchard MRT
4
Have been frequenting Wild Honey and enjoyed their all-day breakfast items. However, more recently I had dined at Wild Honey for dinner. To my horror, some of the sides were prepared probably in the late afternoon. The potatoes were cold and the candied bacons were far from crisp (they were tough). Nevertheless, I had many positive experience for brunch and would strongly recommend only having wild honey in the morning.
4
A nice restaurant in a great location with good breakfast options. We visited for poached eggs with bacon and avocado and my wife had the English breakfast option with fried eggs sunny side and bacon, sausages etc. Two things which were desirable in retrospect - Coffee ordered should be advised as before or after brekkie and bread should have options like Sourdough et
4
I met up with some friends for catch up and we had a great experience. The staff were very friendly and the food was great. The portion was really big and most of us had food coma after that. We had a good time there and we will definitely go back again
5
Always my favorite place for meet up with girlfriends or out of town guests. Best all day breakfast in town!
3
The ambience and decoration was lovely. It's suitable for couples, familys and friends as well. The food was nice but abit too pricey for the quality.
4
The ambience was good and conducive for social setting. There are good spacing between tables. Food was good as well.
5
It's been a year since my last trip and their menu items seem to get longer all the time! Almost spoilt for choices. Had a hearty and full brekkie together with my family. Always enjoy their friendly and warm service
5
I had an excellent experience at Wild Honey for Saturday brunch. We were seated right away and reminded of the 100 minute seating time (for busy periods). 100 minutes was more than enough time as the servers were extremely attentive and the food came out quickly. Although everything was very fast, we didn't feel pressured to give up the table before the time was up and the wait staff was not too pushy.We had the Spanish Hash and the Boulevard St Michel. Both were delicious and came in massive portions! We walked away extremely full, no need for dessert or sides. Very good value for the money. The decor of the Scotts Square location is also very nice. The chairs are comfy padded armchairs and the decorations are classy and homey. Would definitely come back again!
4
Wild Honey, next to the Grand Hyatt, offers wonderful breakfast. You must try their lattes that are served with the condensed coffee frozen in cubes and released by pouring hot milk over..Only complaint is that they will not alter any item on the menu..otherwise would be 5 star.
3
The location was fantastic for morning breakfast in town. The website was so awesome and the food were so inviting. The service was great but the food was average and certainly not value for money.
1
1. Although I had indicated that it was a birthday meal. The infor was totally ignored. 2. The food was terrible.3. It is sad to see that Wild Honey is deteriorating "slowly but steadily". It has come to a point of time where the management has to decide if they want to do something about it.4. I had given enough chances. This was the last straw. I will definitely not go back again and will not recommend to my friends as I had used to
3
Had the best cranberry scones with butter and jam, as well as the Brazilian bread. However, I was not too pleased with the hot chocolate. Despite the interesting presentation, I couldn't really taste the richness of the chocolate. Still it was a pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff.
3
In my option this restaurant is no where near as good as it used to be. I ordered a full english breakfast with a side order of Mushrooms. The only thing on the plate that was cooked fresh was the fried eggs. The bacon, potatoes, tomatoes were dry and appeared to have been cooked earlier and kept warm. Not appetizing. The side order of Mushrooms were served straight away on their own, so i ask for them to be served with the meal they were intended to be eaten with they returned with the meal, cold and cold dish, i sent them back and asked for them to be heated, they returned, warm dish and barely warm mushrooms. I gave up
4
Quality of food is excellent. Totally enjoyed the food. Restaurant is comfortable and conducive to talk. Service is good too.
4
I remembered the kale salad, crispy prosciutto, bread basket and our lime margarita. You'll spend about SGD50 per person for a chill catch up with your friends. I'll be back for the long table :)
5
Personal favourites are the Spanish hash, I love ny and English! great place to chill and hang out with friends!
3
Overall the quality of food is good. However the staff needs to be trained to offer the basics of service. We know it's casual dining and don't expect too much of promptness or exclusive sevice..but the basics - Courtesy & Friendliness were nowhere to be seen among the servers. Pathetic is what I can say about experience...lucky the food is good for ifurther it wasn't then would be our first and last visit
3
While the water is self service, someone had mistakenly asked for water and instead of informing nicely that it was self service, the staff decided to get it anyway but pull a face while at it. Simple things like this are really unacceptable at a place like this especially with such prices. Another point which we failed to understand was that we had asked for 1 poached egg for a toddler, this was after all adults had had their meals. They refused to accommodate as they said it's not 'on the menu'. It is a brunch venue, surely 1 egg could be accommodated and just charged as an open food item. I am quite a loyal fan of Wild Honey but for the prices and the positioning of this restaurant one would expect the service to be up to standards.
5
We love the food at Wild Honey! Fantastic brunch and the atmosphere really make us feel relax and enjoy our pleasant Sunday
3
Must go when u are super duper hungry. Which applies to us. Menu wise is quite standard. But would be good if there is pictures to visualize.
1
Made a booking and was at the reception. There was a queue after me. A white woman barged in and asked for her table. She was served and given a table before those in queue and even if I had a reservation. And when I told the staff in charge she looked at me like 'why are you complaining!!!' 20mins after my reservation still not given a table. That made it totally not worth a cent spent there
2
My reservation was at 415pm but i arrived at 4pm on 3rd dec16. Brought to an outdoor table and i told the hostess (filipino) can we have an indoor seating instead since I am early for my reservation n i am willing to wait. " yah but this is a bigger table for u and its sofa seating". I dont know what her reply was about but if I need a indoor seating and I am willing to wait, as a service staff, you should accomodate to my needs.  During order taking, the chinese lady server gave no eye contact, went "ngh ngh." in acknowledging our order without opening her mouth. It was just terrible.. and when our food arrived and we asked the male server (Filipino) for butter, he went "and den?" Please train your service staff to have basic service values.. I know the restaurant can get busy but this is not acceptable at all. Food was good but the whole experience is ruined because of bad mannered staff. Do they even go through an interview before joining your team? or even do u guys even do basic service training? Please check on them, from my timing of reservation and dates, you can easily figure out who the staffs were.
5
Love the restaurant at Scotts square... brilliant healthy fresh breakfast options as well as not so healthy options too! Either way all freshly prepared and wonderful setting with comfy seats and friendly staff- highly recommend ! However you may need to make a booking at the weekend when it gets busy!
5
The food and drinks were excellent as usual and we love the ambience. Customers service is on its mark.
4
Great ambience plus great food. Big portion of delicious all day breakfast. Easily accessible as it's very near to mrt.
5
Staff was friendly and food arrived fast. Atmosphere was very pleasant and ambience was beautiful. Recommended
5
We stayed for a long chat. Must be about 4 hours but they did not chase us away! Lol! The place was crowded. Food also good!
5
Lovely restaurant overlooking Scotts Road, amazing menu, cold drinks. A pleasure to dine here whether a snack or full meal required
4
Service was great. Server was extremely accomodaring with my dietary needs and even went to the extend of offering suggestions. Great job! Food was great! Portion sizes were big!
3
Quality of food standards have dropped since it first opened. Flavour composition in the dishes we ordered was gimmicky and no longer enjoyable. Coffee on the acidic side
4
Service and Food at both Wild Honey branches are consistent.Food is always lovely. Our favourite is the Tunisian. Had tried a few other on the menu before and they were good. Love their brioche. I tend to buy a loaf whenever I go. However, they had not paid much attention to the kids' menu. The last visit seems to be the first time we are ordering from the kids' menu as both boys wanted to eat different food. We ordered a waffle and a pancake. The waffle is dry. The pancake is very unappetising. Our son had only a few bites. Nobody actually asked us why but, this is rather typical for Singapore eateries.The wait staff were attentive
3
The food at Wild Honey is always awesome but since my last visit I feel the service and standards have slipped a bit. We had to ask several times for water or drinks to be brought to the table. Simple details like cups being clean, tables being wiped down properly were also lacking. It's a shame because it does tarnish the experience somewhat.
4
A friend recommend it Wild Honey and we were not disappointed. The place has some charm, the staff is friendly and the menu is good. The food was delicious and the portions are reasonable. The coffee and the juices are also good. It's not cheap but worth it. Quality food and relaxed atmosphere. I cannot wait to go again and try a new tasty dish
5
Service from all the staff I had encountered was great! Portions of food were bigger than other cafes and quality was awesome
5
Had brunch with my friend on Sunday. Service was good, Food was good. Would definitely visit them again when I have cravings for brunch food.
5
Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I was early with my reservation and was given a seat immediately.
4
only 100minutes given even on reservation.oni the broiche bread is nice, the rest v common. shld go on days with no time limit so to relax n enjoy my foods.
5
I loved this place as soon as I walked in - friendly staff, prompt service, taken to a table straight away (I did arrive almost as soon as it opened), nice table at a good height for eating (not impractically low), nice comfortable seating, good spacing between tables so you didn't feel like you were dining with strangers at the next table. The coffee was excellent and the food amazing - I had the flinders something (can't remember its name) and it was so good. I think the food price is justified - the food is unique and very well thought out, lovely complementary ingredients used for the dish I had, and a large portion. The coffee is overpriced but that might be normal for Singapore although I'm not sure (I haven't actually checked the price of any of the coffees I had here so far). Highly recommended - great place for breakfast if you're stopping in st Singapore for a few days in between long haul flights from the U.K. to New Zealand
3
Nice, relaxed atmosphere for either couples or families. Food lucks better than it is - somehow the flavors don't really go together. Coffee was decent. I prefer the bakery at Nassim Hill over this place. Meal sat with me all day.Good kids menu.
1
The food served was cold. Latte came too early and was cold when the mains came..mains were cold when served..very bad experience this tim
3
First impressions was that the atmosphere was good but perhaps a separate tables were too near to one another. The food were expensively priced but tasted, at best, average. Will probably not return again
4
wide selection of breakfast options that serve whole day long. love the Common Man coffee roasters offered in Wild Honey, glad to support local brand
2
I booked a table for breakfast for myself and two friends. It was a Monday and therefore quieter than usual. We ordered prosecco, coffees and a breakfast each. I decided on 'Flinders Lane'. The dish is supposed to come with 2 poached eggs but as I don't like poached eggs I kindly asked the Manager who was serving us if they could be scrambled instead. I was simply told 'no'. On protest the Manager then told me that the menu was completely inflexible and that I would have to have the dish without any eggs at all. This conversation lasted the span of 5 minutes before I finally gave up. It was my friends birthday and I didn't want to cause a scene. This is the second time I've experienced this level of appalling customer service at the Scotts Square branch. It's a pity as the food on all of my visits has been delicious, with or without eggs. It's a great shame that the customer service, or lack of it, really lets this place down. I won't be revisiting anytime soon
5
Great service and brunch! We enjoyed our mains and coffee. Will definitely come back again in the future.
4
Nice brunch, as we order the English bkfast. Nice environment to catch up and the service is good! Pity that I could not use the Visa promo code as I had only found out about it after I reached the place.
4
Breakfast with friends.. Not the first time visit wild honey their food never disappoint me... buy voucher from chope to enjoy 10% discount..
4
Went there for a friend's birthday. I love the interior and good quality of foods there!
I ordered the beef (aussie) while somw of my friends ordered the english (pork) and norway (salmon).
Oh...all the foods are great and excellent!
4
We visited this restaurant by chance and we ordered 3 brunches and really enjoyed the time we spent at wild honey!
4
We have been visiting this place for years and we love this place. The food and environment are great.
3
This is not my first time here, but I noticed the services and food standard are depreciating. The quality of food had dropped and special request like " no charred on the dishes" were not met.
3
A little of service hiccups.
But there was a service recovery done by the manager. Love the cosy ambience.
4
Good brunch menu and nice restaurant. Very popular but I find it off-putting that they remind you of the 100 minute time limit before you sit down although in this particular case, it was not full and no waiting queues.
4
A great brunch place with plenty of variety to choose from. Items are rather pricey but some of the dishes do offer good value. The teas starts at $11 before tax but it's non refillable. Really
4
A nice experience... the portion of food is worth the amount paid for. Will defintely return for more.
1
Too late service and terrible manner!
One of the managers asked customers even still eating to go out since given time-100mins-was up
5
First visit and loved it. Very impressed with the decor, comfortable seating. 4 of us ate different meals and each were excellent and thouraghly enjoyed, along with the tea and coffee served. We had baby's pram and the staff very accommodating. Definitely going again
4
Came in a party of 5 and they seated us at a great table, that didn't make the odd number awkward. Really great decor.
5
I order something different every time and I'm never disappointed. The poached eggs are always good - they have an orange yolk so you know they are healthy eggs. Knowing the food is organic makes it even more special.
4
Restaurant served good quality all day breakfasts. Cosy environment too. Service was generally good also. Keep it up !
5
Do make a reservation in advance. Interesting menu, cannot be found elsewhere in SG. Actually coffee is only average. I had a flat white.
5
Central location easy walk from Orchard MRT. We were seated in a couple of wingback chairs, at first wondered how practical that would be to eat our lunch but it was very comfortable to sit and chat with my friend and to eat our meal. I had the Flinders Lane YUM. Service was quick. Only reservation I had when booking was a note that popped up that as it was peak time, we maybe asked to vacate our seat 1hr40mins after our booking time. This was not an issue on this visit
4
Loved the place! Great food. Good service. I was disappointed with their policy on getting a cup of ice. They offer water at room temperature. I ask for ice and they wanted to charge $1 for a cup of ice! At the cost of the meals, charging $1 seems a bit odd for what would have been a flawless experience.
4
Wild Honey kept me sweet in Singapore. The SoCal option: omelette, mozzarella, kale puree(add salt!) was scrumptious the dishes hit was the capsicum jam (red pepper), step aside tomato K. It is a busy spot, book in advance and bring . Very friendly staff and good customer service. You can take a sample of their daily sweet treats as you exit. They are usually sitting on the bar behind the concierge's table.
4
I love the cosy warm atmosphere. The service was good and prompt. The sofa seats is so comfortable and felt like home. They do have baby seats. So do ask for it.
5
Service was prompt as usual. The food was also served promptly even though the restaurant was almost full at 9.30am.
4
Standard of food is always there, though the portions are pretty big. Love the fresh juices and even iced latte (the iced coffee cubes served with warm milk)
3
Food is really good but think their staff need some training - there were at least 5 or 6 on duty but never anyone there to take orders etc as they all seem to want to stand by the kitchen hatch or front door. Such as shame as the food is so good that this place could be amazing if they had someome to whip the staff into shape
1
The place was small, crowded and we were only given 100minutes of dining and chilling enjoyment. It wasn't an enjoyment too. We had to raise our voice in conversations and the service crew were inexperienced. Giving poker faces when we asked questions about our orders. Poor. Not going there again
3
i find it too pricey, although the selection of food is more than your average brunch place, and I'm tempted to return to try the other items on the menu
5
We found this place off a foodie review from #ladyironchefIt turned out to be right across the road from our hotel Royal Plaza on Scotts. It's in Scotts Square level 3 not easily found but so worth it. Best ice coffee I've ever had!The food is $$ put standard Singapore fare. The portion sizes are generous, eggs great and bread selection brilliant. Lovely setting and wait staff attentive and food service quick as! Will come here again when in Singapore!
4
The place was packed when i was there. Reservation is preferred. Price is on the higher side but quality of food is good. Ambience is cozy but quite noisy as it is more like casual dining. Great place for catch up with friends but not so much of intimate meal. Overall experience was good.
2
Staff looked bored and unengaged. Was part of a group of 6. Stuffed us at a corner and extremely cramped table
4
I love everything about this place. Food, service, ambience, and plenty of highchairs for the kids. I usually eat at the Mandarin Gallery venue but this time tried Scotts Square. I ordered the Norwegian and after having it a few times now, it is by far the best in my opinion. You must try it. As expected, we had to leave our pram outside the restaurant so as to leave room for other diners inside (at Mandarin Gallery, we don't have to). I'm not entirely comfortable about doing this (still new to Singapore) but it seems quite common thing to do here
5
This is best place to have breakfast, great food, service and common man roasters coffee is perfect combination.
4
The ambience of the restaurant is lovely. The food and coffee is good. Good service too. Will return again.
5
The food there is excellent just a bit slow , but the food quality compensates all
Really loved the mocha and cauliflower salad
4
I love the English breakfast here... Everything is so tasty..I have tried the pancakes with bacon as well and so satisfied with it..The mixed bowl of fruits was nicely presented and obviously fresh.This place is popular and to avoid a long queue better book in advance especially if you're going for breakfast and brunch on weekends... During our walk-in on weekends one time, we waited over 30 mins and we were starving.
4
Pros :+ Good taste+ Portion is true to "westerner"+ Great Ambient+ Decent serverCons :+ If only they serve true main course menu, I'll be gladly to give 5 stars(They mostly serve breakfast menu
3
This is a good place for breakfast/brunch with a nice, comfortable setting. The alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktail menu looked delicious and the raspberry, orange and ice cocktail was absolutely delicious. My husband chose the schnitzel sandwich with avocado on a brioche bread which he said was okay, served with a side of breakfast potatoes (which were cold roast potato pieces - disappointing)I had the vegetarian sandwich with sautéed mushrooms, and artichokes on toasted sourdough bread. The menu also mentioned chargrilled vegetables and mozerella cheese, but only the tiniest bit was on the sandwich - so mine was rather disappointing, although I enjoyed the Israeli salad ( chopped tomato and cucumber) that accompanied it
4
Sunday morning breakfast with family... My first time to wild honey... I must say it did live up to my expectations... Had heard good things about this place...The scones with clotted cream... The French toast.. Scrambledeggs with bread.. We're really good... Also loved the Brazilian bread and the caramel milkshake...Would love to go back again in my next trip to singapore
4
Me and my wife wanted European style breakfast after few days in Singapore. We specifically took taxi to get to Wild Honey. They have a nice menu and pleasant interior. Food and drinks were good. This place is also expensive and probably you will not go there for breakfast every morning
5
Everything is fine just that 1 of the waitress that help us take down menu is not attentive enough..It's our first time experience dining at Wildhoney @Scotts Square. We ordered 1 roasted almond latte but the waitress didn't ask us whether want it in hot / cold..end up it come out hot.
5
A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it for the good, high quality food and vibe of the restaurant. Note: it does get a little noisy from the number of the other customers around you.
5
Food was good and portions were reasonably sized. service staff looked overworked but were still friendly and efficient.
4
Enjoyed the breakfast spread with my partner. It was his first time to Wild Honey. I had Tunisian for breakfast! eggs were amazing
5
Extensive and well thought out menu, polite and attentive staff and the food was top quality. I highly recommend the portobello or the flinders lane. Will be making this restaurant a staple.
4
Was there for brunch couple of days ago. Looove the breakfast. Child friendly. They can improve on the service, service was quick but felt cold and than warmer.
5
Despite the exorbitant price, Wild Honey is great for a once-in-awhile indulgence. The ambience is perfect for a cozy meal. Who doesn't love all day breakfast? Give me poached eggs with english muffin and salmon anyday.
5
Food was excellent, service was prompt and always available. The environment was also quiet and comfortable, really enjoyed it. :)
5
Went there for breakfast one morning after missing it in our hotel. Splendid menu with all nationality choices. Very nice place to eat with service excellent. Situated on orchard road in the shopping centre called Shaws.
3
The service manager wasn't attentive and gave a seemingly nonchalant attitude. On the other hand, food and ambience were great.
4
I liked that we were given a cosy seat by the side and simply loved the ambient lights though a tad dark. Food was relatively good. However, my friend's order of overeasy eggs came a little charred. She was offered a replacement for the egg but declined as we were quite full from the generous portion of food.It gets a little crowded but the patrons were generally considerate so it wasn't too noisy.Would visit again for sure!Love that Chope had a $5 discount + $5 rebat
5
The food is awesome and the portion is satisfying. The service is good as well. We were arranged to sit near to the area for the staff to wipe cutlery, it will be good if they can remove the section as it is quite uncomfortable to have someone wiping cutlery just next to you while customers are dining there.
5
Amazing breakfast as usual. Yummy honey bacon. Good fresh juice. Nice decoration.
Very Expensive too! Very crowded.
5
The last time I visited was about 2 years back. Happy to share that the standard of service and food have remained high.
4
Simply fabulous. Lucky to be able to get a table for 8. Fantastic food presentation and good service. The coffee is so so ( although this is just a personal preference)
4
love the ambiance of the restaurant and the food was value for money for the portion served.
Its a good place for me to go with my baby to catch up with friends.
4
Ordered 1 single scoop chocolate ice cream, 1 Paris hot chocolate & 1 Cold Brew. All are good and fantastic. First time we came and all tables are fully reserved. This round we called up in the morning to reserve a table at 3:30pm. Definitely will come again for meal.
5
This is one of our favorite places in Singapore for breakfast/brunches. Prices are high, but you get huge portions and everything tastes really good. The new item on the menu (Pastrami Benedict) is great. The waffles were so tasty my friend said that's one the best breakfasts he's ever had! I've been to both their locations multiple times, make sure you reserve if you go on weekends
2
Poor service, little to no attention on customers. Long wait for food. Worse is they charge $1 for ice cubes which I find unacceptable, given food is not cheap there
5
Brunch is a big deal in Singapore, and it doesn't get much better than Wild Honey. There are two locations currently and they're both great, although I believe the menu does differ slightly. Service is usually excellent, the food (themed by locations around the world) is just fantastic, and I would like to pay particular homage to the vanilla iced lattes in which the coffee is set into ice cubes... just so so good. Do yourself a favour and head to Wild Honey this weekend
4
As usual, good customer service experience. However menu probably needs to update to keep customers coming regularly.
3
I had heard about this place from a number of people, so I was looking forward to checking it out. Maybe I had too high of expectations, but in the end, I didn't find it all that exceptional. The menu was fairly interesting with some unique dishes. But the prices are fairly high and the ambiance is loud. Despite a nice greeting upon arrival from the host, I had to call over the server to order and to get the check. Would I go back? Maybe for breakfast ( which is apparently their forte) but otherwise, probably not
5
Quite pricey but love the food and atmosphere there. Service was excellent and items ordered were served quickly.
5
It was a chill and a good time at Wild Honey. This is my 2nd time there and I am definitely not disappointed:)
4
The decor is absolutely beautiful with an outdoor patio looking onto Scott's Road. I've only had the Tunisian breakfast but it is good every time. The drink prices can be a bit steep.
3
The flavours work here. And breakfast is of an acceptable quality. The coffee is decent and the wait staff are pretty nice. However.... U will get a bill shock. It's expensive and unforgivingly so.
5
Delicious food, nice location, close to Orchard, service staff is verv friendly, the only negative point: a bit pricy.
5
We were getting a little tired of hotel breakfast so my partner surprised us with this pick. After a little searching we found it on the 3rd floor of a very quite shopping centre and were seated with in minutes without an reservation (on the condition that we would vacate the table in 100 min). Room was lovely and service was prompt. We ordered the yummy Brazilian bread balls which were a nice start for 3. I had the french toast which I was afraid would leave me with sugar overload but was very surprised how well balanced it was and not at all sticky sweet. My son had the delicious waffles which his dad and I were more than happy to help him polish off (dad never eats sweets but loved the custardy filling). For his main he had the pastrami eggs Benedict with the delicious smell wafting my direction. Lovely thick slices of real pastrami with a mustard sauce again eagerly devoured. Not cheap but a really nice meal with decent service
5
I wasn't expected more , but under my wife pursuer I went there , but I didn't regret, they have breakfast all the day , we ordered skakshokah and French toast also herbs tea , all of them was delicious combined with reasonable price and very good service.
4
Made reservation for two at 11.15 am for a Sunday brunch on 24th July. Table was ready when we arrived. Food came timely and was delicious. Portion was a little big for two ladies, value for money I guess. Coffee was not that hot though. Music was too loud. We had to raise our voices a bit to chat. Service was good indeed throughout. Am happy and will come back again.
2
Service was terrible, I made a reservation but table was not ready when we got there. We were okay to wait since we were early (only 5 minutes early but had to wait 15 mins).Waitress didn't know anything on the menu, when we asked any question, she "had to go check". Great range of food but quality was pretty normal.After an hour of being there (around 30 mins after getting our food) we were constantly chased to leave (every 5-10 mins), having told that there was another party waiting for a table. Will definitely not go back. Just a very pretentious over hyped place.
2
It USED to be such a great place with good food . Welcoming staff and service. It has become a victim of its early success I guess : on average 30 to 45 mn line to get a table . Therefore of course, the service is poor. ( why would they care ? It is full anyway ) . Average age is Millenials equipped with IPhones . The food menu has changed , going for more exotic combinations now . Prices are Up. And you have to get your own water. Appalling service by young kids ( clueless ). No Decaf ( Waitress did not even know what we wanted ). Good business I am sure but not for us any more.
3
Before our trip I read about this place frequently on forums and blogs. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but it's not amazing and not worth the money you spend. I'm glad we did it and we enjoyed our food but we wouldn't go again
4
Service staffs were friendly but will be better if they ask before they clear the food plates on our table towards the end of meal. Food is nice but slightly on the pricey side.
4
Loved the Spanish hash and England breakfast (: I would definitely return another day with my family!
4
Came here for brunch on Friday noon, not crowded unlike weekends. Food was normal but pricey. Had order Polocco Latte and it taste bitter.
5
Wild Honey has a great, egg focused, western style menu - perfect for weekend brunch. Reservation essential on Sunday when we visited but we were pleased with the fast service and generous portions. The restaurant is modern and airy with a nice atmosphere. Highly recommended!
4
We went to Wild Honey @ Scotts Square outlet on a lazy Saturday morning for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food there.I had the signature English All Day Breakfast with cuppaccino and my wife ordered the Caribbean Waffles and Pink flamingo tea, all the food items and drinks were spot on and very fulfilling! :DService was prompt and friendly and the ambiance was nice and relax.Total damage for brunch was quite expensive at SGD$70++ , but hey its an occasional indulgence that we could afford.Would definitely recommend this place for a nice chill afternoon
4
Wild Honey is a great place to catch up with friends for good long conversations. With an interesting menu range of dishes named after a continent or country. For example, the "European" was a delicious twist of eggs benedict with proscuitto. Coffee was rich and good. While service was polite, it could be attentive rather than a mechanical customer response. But I think my criticism relates generally to the Singapore hospitality and retail industry, a lack of honing into the customer experience
5
we went to Wild Honey to celebrate a birthday, and we were so engrossed in catching up over the good food and welcoming atmosphere that we did not have enough time to have the bday cake (our seating was limited to 100min only). The Wild Honey team kindly provided us with serviettes and disposable forks so that we could have the cake outside the restaurant
4
There is a point in your Singaporean life where you just want to eat something non-Asian... then this is the place to go. After long queuing (better make a reservation!) you can choose out of a wide selection your breakfast. Dishes are not only tasty but also nice to look at :-
4
The restaurant is in an exclusive shopping mall in the centre of town. We went with friends living in Singapore so weren't sure what to expect. We arrived around 10.00 in the morning and it was empty. It soon filled up with a clientele best described as "ladies who lunch" but apparently this is the opposite of the weekends when it's completely full.We all had cooked breakfast options which were a variation on poached eggs with hollandai sauce. I had a Spanish variation which included chorizo, corned beef and potato, whilst Mrs Vicar had one with prosciutto ham, all very flavoursome and well presented. The breakfast juices are also very good.The prices worked out around £20 per person so not a cheap option but the food and service was very goo
5
Definitely come back here again, the setting was nice and cosy... It's an overall great experience. for me.
4
It's not my first time there. Food portion is great and restaurant has good ambience. Customer service is great too.
5
Wide spread of all-day breakfast, salads & sandwiches. Their brioche is particularly great. My wife is also especially fond of their cappuccino
5
Really enjoyed lunch here, was cool enough of a day to enjoy the balcony
Had 2 different kind of sandwich and post were delicious
Also enjoyed a mojito which was well made
5
After three month later i came there!! Very exellent food than last time it coud be changed chief.and serving very fast food stillwarm too.
3
Location: It's in scotts Plaza level 3? You wouldn't know it's there unless you know it's there although very near orchard road.Service: Very friendly staff and accommodating.Food: Ordinary cafe food (for those who live in an area spoilt of cafes i.e. melbourne). For the price of the food it's nothing to rave about but it's not bad. They have your normal bacon and eggs, waffles, etc. A little pricey especially the coffee at $6.50 which is not very good coffee but drinkable - very weak.It was busy for breakfast so it must be ok if not very good
5
we went as a family and only me before, with friends. Each time, the service was perfect and no matter which dishes I had, all were delicious ! My children loved the waffles and the English breakfast, the Spanish Hash is delicious and so is the goat chees salad. I am sure the rest of the menu is at the same standard of quality. Staff friendly
4
I went to this place for coffee and cake after late lunch a few days ago.The coconut cake was proper bake.The texture was so fluffy.The taste was so rich in coconut and lime flavor.The Flat White coffee was OK.The service was very attentive and friendly
4
Wild Honey is still one of the better brunch spots around Singapore - no gimmicky concepts, just very good bread. Prices are high, but you also get good ambiance and a relatively quiet environment to enjoy a conversation with friends (whether that makes it worth it is still debatable). I had the Tunisian, which was quite well spiced, and loved the accompanying brioche. Unfortunately one of my eggs was far more well done than the other
3
I had a good experience the first time I visited Wild Honey so I decided to bring a friend this time. But the food was disappointing. We ordered European breakfast and Canadian pancakes. The brioche was unremarkable and ham tasted off. The pancakes were doughy and bland, despite the syrup and berries condiments. The bacon that came with the pancakes was so tough I got tired of eating it. Overall it was food that filled you up in an unsatisfactory way. The cappuccino was also bitter; I think the barista decided to be very generous with the mocca powder. My only compliments is the good service I received. I doubt I will ever come again.
4
Brunch at the Scotts road branch was a good experience overall. Portions sizes were too big, but was very tasty and satisfying. Unfortunately the coffee was bit of letdown - acidicity left a poor aftertaste.
4
Went for brunch with a friend. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food was excellent, especially the pancakes and bacon (I think this was 'the Canada' on the menu, but I can't remember).
3
I was going there for Turkish and Ottoman breakfasts which are still great! But they cut down size of their served bread :( and now you have to order additional small bread that they sell for 2$ Before you could finish your food with served bread, now they give very a small size which is not enough by making you to order more! Not fair!!!!! Please return old and proper bread size! Thanks
5
Best coffee we have had in Singapore. The food is fresh and really well prepared, tasty and plates are generous. Staff is friendly and efficient. Fruit juices are great
4
Best smoked salmon egg Benedict I've ever had. There was asparagus as well which I thought was a nice touch. Brioche was toasted nicely and a good serving of avocado. Didn't like the Valrhora hot chocolate much though. Apple pie was also decent.
3
They wasn't near attentive. Not flexible enough. The food wasn't exactly awesome to be so stuck up or that we felt that we are not being attented to sincerely. Just an unfamiliar doing their job
4
Food is really good and fresh! A little pricey (paid almost 50 dollars each) but was definitely satisfying. Service staffs were friendly but was a little slow since we were sitting in the outdoor area. Great place for a gathering with friends :)
3
Wild Honey is centrally located (both venues), nicely decorated and there's usually a nice ambiance. The food is dependable rather than memorable. I have visited the restaurants at various times of day but there never seems to be a time when the staff are not totally overwhelmed. Service is slow and they are incapable of making even the slightest adjustment to orders (for example, asking that an item be served without sauce)
3
I had reserved for a table at Wild Honey with a promo code given during Great Online Shopping Festival. However, it was not reflected at the restaurant's end and I had to wait for them to contact Chope before being able to get the offer which took awhile. It was during my lunch hour and I had to rush back to work after. This made my visit rather unpleasant
4
Nice and cosy restaurant to meet friends and friendly staff to serve us. My friend had a stroller and we had a nice spot to park her stroller and when my friend ask if she can place her milk for the baby in the fridge, the staff said no issue. Good service
5
Great experience. Friendly staff and good food. Nice atmosphere. Highly recommended and will go back again.
5
I love visiting Wild Honey, it's always a great start to the weekend. The service is always of a high standard. When I organised a breakfast meet up with 5 friends, it was very helpful that the staff organised separate bills for each of us.
4
Cosy place. Latte was good and the service was excellent. Enjoyed the place as it was not very crowded, hence, was great to chit chat there (on a weekday before dinner time - great time to patronize).
4
This is the second time I went there. Everything was good. Food is amazing. Oh! One have to try is their iced vanilla latte. That might be the best iced vanilla latte I ever tried. One thing is..the first time I didn't make a reservation so I had to sit outside...this time I booked a table and be there on time...but they put us next to their cutlery cleaning station....that's the reason why 
4
It was overall successful because of the food, but need to be improved the spaces of table. I booked for a table for 6 but they provide the table for 4.
5
Came here on Mother's Day without a reservation (as it was full!), and decided to arrive early to try our luck with walk ins. Read that the Scotts Square location is larger and better for walk ins so we ended up there. We arrived at 945am and fortunately had a table although we had to vacate by 11am which was perfectly fine with us. Great variety of savory and sweet brunch items, we ended up ordering the European (eggs benedict with prosciutto) and Canadian (pancakes with bacon) breakfast. The European breakfast was good, eggs were perfect and I liked that prosciutto was wrapped around each egg so I could dip pieces of bread into egg without the egg running all over the plate. The Canadian breakfast came with some caramelized bacon (the lean kind) which tasted like bak kua (think a much harder version of bak kua as it is much thinner). It also came with some hibiscus compote and maple syrup. Overall, good brunch food but prices are on the steep side
2
The online reservation is limited to 6 pax, but we were 8. The manager was not pleased we didn't call to inform (which we did but couldn't get through the phone). The manager was also not helpful in getting enough seats.
5
It's been more than a year since I last visited. Was to catch up with a friend ard the area and decided to intro her to wild honey as she has not dined there before. We both enjoyed the warmth of the atmosphere and food
2
I have not visited this outlet for some time and decided to dine here on Mother's day for dinner with family. The staff greeted us with smiles, and helpful with baby. I ordered Tunisian, Scandinavian, and Brisket Pie. Except for Scandinavian, the other 2 mains were good. Scandinavian is basically, salmon with crispy rosti, asparagus and hollandaise sauce. The Rosti was burnt and it tasted bitter so we requested for a change. After a good 15min, we asked the staff about the replacement and realize that they forgot about it. I told them I am fine if they just replace the rosti for me. But they took it away and just sent me a freshly fried rosti, without the rest. Since it was a celebration, we decided to let it go. Ordered a new dessert item, hot ice cream sandwich. and it turned out to be a really ordinary ice cream sandwich that is not really warm. the dessert was a let down. It could be just one slip of standard but my family will not return in near future until we hear better feedback from friends. Total bill for 3 adults came up to $144.
4
Place was not too crowded, service was good, food served rather quickly, restaurant has a nice ambience. Food was good too, dessert could b better if the ice-cream was in the plate together with the apple crumble rather than placed the in a cup beside the apple crumble
5
The Ottoman breakfast is the only reason that I go to Wild Honey! The best breakfast ever! Enjoy every bit of it!
4
The food was really good, made with fresh ingredients.
The ambience and decor was very comforting.
Thanks,
4
Great place, good food, great ambience. Service was okay.. price not exactly value for money but you pay for quality of food and ambience
4
Great place for weekend brunch. Most of the food I have tried are to my liking. Especially their sweets selection.
3
Is my second try at this restaurant but first time at Scott's square branch. Is much bigger compared to Mandarin Gallery.
Had English breakfast, the potatoes are tasty. Price is on the higher side.
1
I had Tunisian - which tasted worse than the shakshuka at Pita Pan at Marina Bay Sands. I was feeling adventurous and ordered the Wild drink - which has honey, espresso and chocolate - it tasted like food with identity crisis - couldn't decide what to be, and was too sweet and awful. Waffles was horrible too. I heard the salmon toast is alright, if I decide to give the place a second chance again, I might try that. The ambience was cosy and nice though.
2
One person at the table asked if she could have her eggs well done. The server said no, it was too late, and they couldn't change the order. We didn't receive the food for another 15minutes. My friend didn't eat her meal - the runny eggs. The server took away the full plate of food, asking how it was. My friend said it wasn't cooked the way she wanted. Still, true to Wild Honey style, she paid for her full uneaten meal
3
....but not so much on the service. It's not completely bad, food is fantastic and the ambience is great. Prefect setting for a date or a get together with friends. But services need to step up
4
This place is always full partly because I think they leave a lot of time for reservations. It's slightly irritating because the reservation system says its full but when you come down, one realizes that there is still a lot of space available. Having said that, it's great to come here for breakfast. Love the food.
4
Had a wonderful time at the Scotts Square branch! Nice and quiet, swanky decor and had a lovely relaxing time with a gal pal.The hot cinnamon, honey beverage was really good! Forgot what it was called but it was under the mocktail section.We had the 'Tunisian' and the 'Delancy' to share. The Tunisian is a classic, really good stuff. The brioche was lovely! The Delancy I found a bit too meaty for my liking.The coconut cake was ace! Really good balance of coconut and lemon curd filling!Would definitely come back here for a good breakfas
4
Coffee is good. Overall slightly overpriced but then all breakfast places are. Portions is quite big.
5
Is my second time having breakfast here. Food is nice reasonable price. Cozy place. I will come again!
5
Food was outstanding as usual. Environment a bit noisy so not really suitable for business discussions.
4
Very well cooked and presented food. Portions were very large but quite expensive for what we had. Ok for a special occasio
4
First of all would like to talk about the service. I was late and my table was given to the other guests. But the staff was very nice to me and manage to get me a table and "warn" me i can only have the table for 1hr. But throughout my meal I was not ask to leave early. Now about the food. I ordered the European all day breakfast. But wo! It should be breakfast cum lunch! The serving for me an Asian is huge and awesome. My friend had the salmon. And he said it was one of the best he had. My Flat white is a bit disappointing. But apparently my friend enjoyed their hot choc very much. Overall, Wild Honey make my sat and gathering a very joyous one
5
The place was real quiet and the food was excellent almost comparable to the meal I had in Europe! Presentation was superb. The staff were extremely polite. Kudos will definitely come again! Staff actually wanted to dim the lights for a more sensual effect I think. But it was too dark for me and I requested for them to notch it up a little
4
This is a kid and family friendly whole day breakfast menu place. They have good scones and pancakes. Frequented by locals and expats. Love also their big breakfast that includes the usual egg, bacon, sausage, etc. Very cool interiors and just nice to relax before you start your day. Service is good also. A bit on the pricey side
5
Me and my boyfriend came here for breakfast and everything from the food, the service, the atmosphere were amazing, I ordered the eggs benedict and my boyfriend ordered a full English breakfast, and the quality was superb. We were never waiting to be served and the staff all had smiles on their faces which was really lovely to see. We finished off with their in-house made red velvet cake which was enormous, just like all of their portions. You will definitely not be disappointed if you choose to dine here and you will be left feeling so full after which is always a good sign! Highly recommended
5
Very good quality of food and service. only one thing the place a bit noisy, when talk with friends, cannot hear if talk in a low voice. portion of food quite big. and tasty very good with good looks.
2
Stack of 3 burnt pancakes at $20++?! Not worth at all. Atmosphere was good though. Won't be going back anytime soo
4
Exquisite breakfast. Very tasty and delicate in every way.
We ordered the Smoke salmon, my wife the grilled salmon, my daughter the pancakes and a pumpkin salad to share. Cost $95 without drinks!
It was a little expensive.
4
I like coming to Wild Honey for its menu of breakfast plates. Good variety, and all very tasty. Good coffees, teas and cakes too. If you're going at meal times, I'd recommend that you make reservations as it is usually full.
5
The food and ambience was excellent !! My kids love it !
For sure we will recommend our friends and family....
;)
5
convenient location. Fantastic food and romantic inside decoration. Staff is nice to let us in 30mins before my reservation. Waitress and waiters are also nice.
4
Wild honey is always crowded, that is why booking in advance is better.And all is deserved, the brunch is full of many choices, even if there is no special formula, so the bill can be slightly expensive, if you want to add an drink and a coffee!The portions are big, and products are tasty!The place is good, for couple, or group
5
We have booked a table for a brunch on Sunday, service was quite fast despite the fact that the restaurant was really full.The food was really good, and presentation on the plate was nice! The choice is very broad, you can have dishes from Europe, the Middle East....We took the Malawah (fluffy crepe from Yemen) - it was really fresh, coming with avocado, tomatoes, asparagus and eggs (see picture). Was really tasty and I must say it is quite hard to find this dish in Singapore :)We also ordered the English breakfast (see picture) with eggs, sausage, mushrooms, beans - everything was good especially the beans!I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu - everything looks so nice and especially the dessert
5
We were there with our twins babies and a friend. Staff gave us a nice sofa table which was perfect because we had to hold to babies and eat plus we had a lot of stuffs. And the even recognized us. A very nice touch! Keep it up.
3
Wild honey is one of our fav restaurants in SG for it's ambience and food and we do visit the restaurant frequently. Last week we took 2 of our friends who came from overseas and the experience we had was bad. There were flies flying around our table and one fly even fell into the tea my friend was drinking, they did replace the tea but the situation was quite embarrassing for us. Staffs apologized for the same but we were expecting them to give us something to compensate and to impress my friends but nothing happened. Have to think twice before bringing any new friends there now, did not expect such an embarrassing thing in an expensive restaurant like Wild Honey. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and respond so that we can still keep visiting the restaurant
3
The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. The food quality and taste is ok. However, the price of the food is quite steep. The bill came up to ~ $43 per person for a main course and a drink
3
I've never been to a restaurant where they've told me I have to be out within an hour and a half, before they've even seated me. The food is well cooked but nothing out of the ordinary. To be honest the reminders that I had to leave within 'x' minutes ruined my experience and I won't be back. Maybe try the Marriott breakfast buffet for about the same price and wayyyyy better food and service
4
Went with wife and son. We enjoyed the food. I like the potatoes. They are delicious! The green apple juice was fresh too!
3
The breakfast is overpriced and the service staff young and inexperienced.
Overall, a lot of hype but really just an all day breakfast cafe disguised as an oasis....
5
Good breakfast great taste and service, easy to locate but pricing is a bit pricy. Worth to try once is enough.
4
The waitresses were very accommodating to our orders. And they were very attentive to our needs too. Thank you.
4
I choose a Norwegian breakfast. Taste was so nice and we had a good time at there. I want to try other country's one next time.
5
They were amazing! As we had a later reservation and the restaurant was not overly crowded, we sat and enjoyed breakfast and Prosecco for 6 hours and the servers and manager were amazing. They even brought us an extra dessert and bottle of bubbles on the house! The food and coffee is always fantastic, but the service yesterday was superb
1
We went there for dinner. Brought along our 5 years old. Kids menu were not suitable, limited choices dinner menu. Basic like pasta and french fries also dont have. Dont have sauce Chili *shock * . Rental is expensive at scotts square, better wake up before it is too late. Good luck am not going to return anymore
1
Several years ago we dined at Mandarin Gallery outlet and it was impressive with the food quality and service was impeccable. But in the most recent trip at Scott's outlet was a total disappointment where we ordered Aussie and both portion came with the rump meat was totally tasteless & bland. After we have made payment and upon exiting the entrance, we were stopped by the waitress accusing us of not paying the bill. Furious I was as we even given a tip! The waitress should have checked before embarrassing the customer. This is totally unacceptable and we will never return to dine at this place. Not worth the money with such mediocre food quality and terrible service. A total disappointment
5
Went to grab a quick brunch with my husband on a weekend. The place was packed! (Testimony to the great food) We still managed to get seats and really enjoyed ourselves. We had one main to share as their portions are generous! Will definitely be back :
4
We were late for about 10 minutes and they still reserve the seats for us. And because we were with some bags after shopping and asked if they have side table to put our bags, they said no but after a while there's a lady who brought us a chair to put our things. Food is good and their service is great too. Will go back again
4
Everything was good ; ambience , food , music etc . Make the portion bigger especially the salmon , we are paying at the price of $26 and you give us about 4 slice of salmon ?
5
Staff is very accommodating to my changes and is spontaneous to the request made. Will definitely visit again. Great food and atmosphere.
5
Not my first visit to this place, but always love their food, ambience, and service. Quite crowded on weekends so better to make a booking before.
3
Batting above their average, with their attitude towards their guests. Believers in their own hype, when the food barely meets the mark. More style than substance.
3
Food is okay nothing to rave about and it's very pricey.
There's 2 of us and reached to 100 Plus which in other cafes wouldn't be that much :(
5
Breakfast here and no need to eat until after 6pm. Food is delicious, service good and the restaurant is pleasant and comfortable. Range of dishes to suit any taste and preference.
4
Place was nice to spend a chillax Saturday afternoon. Food is yummy & staff sre friendly. Will be back there to eat again.. :)
3
Fav restaurant for years. Food standard has dropped. Bit into egg shells and coffee unusually bitter.
3
Hadn't been here in a while and forgot about the high prices! Ambiance is always lovely and service was not overly attentive but polite and friendly. Friend had blueberry pancakes, and for $20, you would expect at least a few (or even a lot of) fresh blueberries; instead it came with a blueberry "syrup". Disappointing.I had the Santa Fe, which was fine, but really not worth the $18 I paid. It was a slower morning so I appreciate the fact that the staff did not rush us out the door and allowed us to stay for quite a while. All in all, it is a nice place for coffee and breakfast breads but rather pricey. An occasional indulgenc
4
Pros:- Great service! Staff were attentive and accommodating.- Were seated almost immediately. (we usually have to wait in their other outlet in Mandarin)- Food is beautifully presented. (Great for IG, if you're into it)- Serving is pretty big. (Share them and get a side)Cons:- 90 mins max stay. (due to high reservations)- Can be a tad too loud.- Bit on the pricey side.Love the Banofee Brûlée
5
Great ambiance to chill out with friends.
Food was good too, though a little expensive! Will return!
3
Food is good, but overpriced. Service is terribly slow and difficult to flag down a waiter/tress. Venue is very loud and it is difficult to have a conversation.
5
Been going at least once a month. Food is of good portions. Fresh and tastefully done. Causal atmosphere
5
Food and coffee are of high quality and very delicious. Service staffs are attentive. Price is a bit on the high side but is well worth
4
An enjoyable Friday night dinner. Food was really great and ambience was perfect for an evening to unwind.
5
Great service. Cosy Environment. Given a long table coz we have 8 pax. Very comfy. Excellent food. Thumbs up!
2
Ambience is nice and service was good but food was forgettable :( bread was too hard, pancakes has limited ingredients and food and beverages are overpriced :(
2
Inwas expecting nicer food since have heard many reviews but guess i was expecting too much. Pancakes were too thick and dry. The make matters worse, when me and my friend wanted to order desserts, we were told as there isnt enough time left hence i cannot order! I cannot believe what i heard but to have a time restriction of 1.5hrs while out with frenz over brunch is ridiculous
5
Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day that's why dining at Wild Honey is such a wonderful experience for me. The Laid Back, Cool and homey ambiance adds up to the charm of this restaurant. The food is pleasing to both the eye and my tummy :)
2
I am a frequent parton of this restaurant, however in the last visit I requested 3 times for a bread replacement on my sandwhich due to dietary restrictions being pregnant. A bread which was already being served on other sandwhiches. In spite of making this request 3 times and explaining the reason behind the request, it was refused citing it would "spoil the presentation" When the dish arrived it was no more than a piece of chicken in betwene 2 pieces of bread. Which could be any bread. No other presentation. Turns out that th restaurant would rather follow the whims and fancies of their executive / head chef rather than pay heed to a customer request for dietary reasons. They didnt seem to be very apologetic about it either... Very disappointing... not sure if I'd want to go back there or recommend this place as part of the experience is about the service you receive,,
5
Relaxed setting. Good food. Small alcholic drink selection, but fine. Comfortable chair to nurse sleeping toddler. Went for afternoon. Will go back for brunch.
4
We enjoyed a very nice dinner at Wild Honey. The menu is aimed as all day breakfast type of menu, but it had some nice dishes for all of us.
Atmosphere was very good. Good service.
3
Not my first time there. Food and service was good as usual. However, I was allocated a small and cramped table although I made reservations and the place was not packed.
4
The food was excellent. I enjoyed it very much. I personally did not like being given a time limit to spend my breakfast there, but other then that, the service was good.
4
The wild honey outlet at Scotts is quiet for catch ups and dates compared to the Sister branch at Mandarin Gallery. Food and coffee there are great too!
5
Great European Breakfast and awesome coffee
Nice atmosphere
A bit overprice and service can be slow
But definitely going back
4
Ate here twice (Scotts Road location) within a 3-day span. Both good experiences.First visit we had the English and new one with pastrami under poached eggs with hollandaise. The second visit we had the Norwegian and the Scandinavian.The food is well prepared and substantive. The Pastrami/Egg Plate and the English were the best values. Wholesome and abundant for the prices.Service was quick and pleasant.Bustling atmosphere, but relaxing decor.Reservations are recommended for the better seating. The waiter eventually accommodated us.Free water with your meal. That is a welcomed offer in Singapore.One issue: poached eggs should not be placed under heat lamps for a significant period as they overcook.We will return here on our next visit

Been here twice this year. The first time was not a pleasant one. We were escorted to table where there were huge decorations in the middle of it. One of the decoration was a huge pineapple that almost blocking the view of my friend's face who sat opposite me. We requested for change of table as we saw there were few available but were rejected. Reason being they were reserved. Picturing that that the table won't have enough space for our orders, we requested for the decorations to be removed. The manager did, but you could expect the unhappy feelings in him. We ordered our food and wine. As we were eating, the water from air conditioner dripped on my table, lucky it didn't drip on my food though. We voiced out about the problem to one of the staff, asking that probably we could move to another table to continue our wine after eating. The staff came back and said they are preparing another table for us. But we didnt expect that they demand us to move immediately while my friend has not finished her food. It is very rude to ask someone who is still eating to move to another table with their halfway consumed dishes, especially your customer! So we insisted that we didnt mind to move after we finished our food. But the manager demanded again to move immediately with reason there were some customers still lining up for tables. Well you could give the available tables for them bro, we could wait. Some other customers will leave too when they were finished, we could have a table then. Rolled eyes

Visited this cafe 3rd times. Hubby likes the breakfast there as lots of variety in the menu. Love the food there but a bit pricey. We ordered Boulevard St Michel and Monte Cubano. Portion is huge, suggest for sharing if you are a small eater. Staffs are polite and friendly. I paid $45 for $50 voucher via Chope and we did top up some amount for this meal

the english breakfast was substatial & certainly filled me up & the quality exceptional.my wife had the goat cheese salad & she is still raving about it,the staff weRE knowledgable & attentive without being intrusive.we have a new favourite brunch stop in Singapore.WILD HONEY ROCKS!!!THANKS , SEE YOU SOONJOHN & RUTHMALAYSI

Good food and atmosphere. Place was not crowded so could stay as long as we wanted. Servers were a little over-enthusiastic to clear plates when we were not finished and there was a small amount of food left on the plate still.
5
Our 2nd visit to Wild Honey @ Scotts Square. Food hasn't disappointed yet and neither has the service. Hoping for it to continue on. Wholemeal brioche is lovely as well and we keep taking whole loaves home for breakfast.
1
The waitress kept rushing us to finish our meals & made us pay the bill before we finished. Terrible
5
Love it here. Great food, coffee and fun vibe. Always busy and buzzing. Huge amount of choice and really interesting breakfasts with versatitlity

My friend and I were there on a weekday before 5.30pm. The place was enticingly cosy as it was empty. Perfect for a quiet read or afternoon tea by myself. The al fresco wing looks comfy and chic, and looks onto Scotts Road. Too bad it was raining on our visit.We ordered the signature dishes English and European breakfasts. Both were good but portions were too huge for us. My bacon was burnt in several parts though. The Honey CInammon drink came with a stick of cinnamon in it and the staff told us it had been brewed for 4 hours. My friend claimed her sore throat felt better after drinking it. My pot of rose tea had a generous serving of rose buds - I cannot remember if it's Bulgarian or Moroccan roses, but I definitely did not order rosehip. The staff were happy to add hot water to my pot again and again. I believe plain water costs S$1 so it might be good to check with staff before asking for plain water.I did not quite like the smell hanging in the air. I think it's some sort of oil but it's a smell that I have never liked cos it reminds me of pee. Staff were friendly and polite, and one was positively chirpy, although sometimes it took quite a while to get their attention even though there were just my friend and I there, as they busied themselves with the cutlery and decor or something.This outlet has a more business-like or working adult feel. The outlet at Mandarin Gallery has a more industrial vibe and seems to attract more youngsters and tertiary students. I had a good time there so I took a friend to this outlet.I paid S$45 for a S$50 voucher via Chope

The food was decent, western style comfort style. They will not make even the slightest changes to menu items. Want to have toast instead of a bagel? Can not. If you are happy with whatever they give you, it's good food - if you want a little consideration for the prices you pay, it can be frustrating.
5
I am amazed and a bit embarrassed I have never reviewed this place before! This is a "go to" for me. I take all visiting friends here and I am a regular visitor. I have had about 70% of the menu. It is excellent. I am never let down. It isn't cheap. Not a greasy spoon type of breakfast however. presentation is quality, food is quality..service..it is really hit and miss. I have had both fantastic and horrible service here. They can be slow and more interested in talking to each other than the attentiveness that one expects in this level of establishment. But when the food comes, with a smile or not, it is fabulous. I can advise to not miss the Brazilian bread! it doesn't say so on the menu but I have figured out that they are gluten free! made with Rice and tapioca flour. warm and delish! Also I cant resist the Paris hot chocolate, simply decadent
4
The food is great and the service is good. The waiter and waitress has been attentive to our needs. It happens to be my wife birthday and I requested for a cake for her. They prepared the cake with candle and even surprise us with some complementary dessert to take away. It is a pleasant evening and we will definitely visit again.

My friends and I visited Wild Honey at Scott's Square yesterday at 11.30am for brunch. It was booked through Chope and the entire online experience was quite a good one. The service was acceptable at the beginning, and the good was great. My wife is in fact a fan of the Tunisian, which is quite excellent. Unfortunately for us, our friends got caught up in terrible traffic on the expressway and ended up arriving some 30-40 minutes later. It was nice that one of the supervisors came over to remind us that we could only hold the table till 1pm, and that we should make our order for our friends to avoid unnecessary delays. We really appreciated this gesture. Things started to go south really towards the end of the meal closer to 1pm when we felt we were being rushed to complete our food and leave the place. My friend was 3/4 though her meal and we tried asking for more time, but we were told that others were waiting outside and no alternative solution was offered. One of the lady supervisors had come by seemingly with a smile to tell us that we had to vacate the table but I caught the change in her expression into one of irritation the moment she had turned her face away. I felt that was uncalled for, and made us feel really unwelcome. Having looked back at the T&C in the booking, I do realise that we have been told that we would have to manage our meal within 90 minutes. That was fair. However, I felt that Wild Honey could have extended some compassion and understanding to us as well - especially given that there were some empty tables around us as well, and my friends were caught up in extenuating circumstances. We did not talk our time away but were frantically trying to complete our meal too. But the wave of waiters coming to tell us we had to leave, plus the final act by the lady supervisor totally soured the meal and made us feel slighted. I suppose it wasn't what was said, but the way it was said, that really disturbed and embarrassed us. Perhaps we should have managed our time better, but could the restaurant have extended us some grace? I think so. But, none was given, and now that I am looking through scores of bad reviews about poor service at Wild Honey on their Facebook page, I can totally understand why

My friend and I ordered Vienna, Britanny and red velvet cake to share. Food was excellent, chicken was tender and the french toast with bananas and salted caramel sauce was not cloyingly sweet, which I really liked. We enjoyed the moist and chocolatey red velvet cake as well, and overall we were very satisfied with the meal even though it was a bit pricey for brunch items. Highly recommend this place for a nice dinner on a weekday night. It can be a bit noisy during weekends.
4
90 minute time frame.
Good selection and taste on breakfast.
Good coffee.
Full all the time and best to reserve early
4
Nice ambience and convenient to catch a breakfast or brunch appointment in the midst of Orchard. Food is satisfying too!
5
Food was great
Service was excellent
Ambience was very nice
Pricey but worth it
Deffinetly try the scones and the Brazilian bites.
4
Loved breakfasting at Wild Honey last weekend. The menu is extensive and offers lots of different options and great flavours. Menu items are on the pricey side, but the food is worth it. The service is good, and the ambiance enjoyable. Will definitely be returning!
5
Spent a pleasant afternoon having tea with friends at this cafe. Warm courteous staff, gorgeous decor and inventive, beautifully presented food makes this one of my new fave hangouts.
4
Have been to Wild Honey before but you do need a reservation. Excellent ambiance. Food beautifully presented. Large portions so what seems a little exoensuve turns out not to be the case. Staff very attentive. Well worth a visit
2
The menu and selections are pretty good for an all-day breakfast place. Food was delicious and drinks tasty. Food portions are generous. But drinks are served in medium sized glasses, doesn't match the size of the generous food serving.The decorations and seatings are comfortable. Nothing too glaring.Only big let down is the mediocre service. Staffs are green, not well-trained, not attentive. Have to ask for salt, pepper, sauces... Respond was slow too
3
Salad is definitely not the item to order here. I paid over $20 for the sweet potato & pumpkin salad that sadly was missing the pumpkin. That left me with a bowl of spinach leaves, sweet potato, chickpeas and sunflower seeds. Very poor value ams a rather uninspired salad.
2
My friends and I had our brunch at Wild Honey Scotts Square. I understand that it was a weekend (Sat) and the so called 90 mins time limit (it started from the time of reservation, not the time you start ordering, which I find it ridiculous). My friends and I were very stressed about finishing the food within the time limit. Even though the staff didn't chase us away when our time was up (while waiting for my friends' arrival, I did saw the staff asked a customer to leave because the reservation party has arrived, which I find it very rude and unprofessional to do that. The customer literally gulping down the 3/4 full of coffee down and made her payment before leaving), the staff with a payment machine was literally standing and hovering next to our table. Indirectly telling up "Get up and time to move your butts"This is something that disturbs me lot. I have been eating at Wild Honey at Mandarin Gallery, and none of the above happened to me. First time trying at Scotts Square and yet such thing happened.Was utterly disappointed, and definitely won't going back to Wild Honey, with such service provided. No matter how good is your food or your atmosphere would be, the service really ......
5
After having lived in Singapore for nearly 3 years now, we've had plenty of time to try out various breakfast/brunch spots, but Wild Honey is the best in Singapore...hands down!! And that's regardless of which location you choose, Scotts Square or Mandarin Gallery. The interior is beautiful, creating a quaint, comfortable setting. The food is tasty and appropriately creative, and the menu is sufficiently diverse offering breakfast & lunch (sandwiches & salads). Try the Californian for a lighter option, and for a treat, recommend the scone with clotted cream & jam or the Brazilian bread. And whether you're vegetarian, gluten or dairy intolerant, the chef is reasonably willing to modify items to accommodate. They also offer a variety of beverage items, including coffees, juices & alcohol. And lastly, service is friendly and helpful, and has significantly improved over time
5
Great food and great ambience. Will come back! I loved the recommendations given by the staff and the welcoming environment.
4
Good food as always. Slightly expensive. Reservations via chope was easy. Chope vouchers are easy to use.
2
Filo turned out to be frozen prata. So disappointed. Excessive charges for that dish. Will not eat there again. Pricy and you only have 1.5 hour to order and finished your meal.
4
Nice and cosy environment to have great awesome all day breakfast. Slightly overprice but all over is good.
4
My friend was over an hour late and we exceeded the 90 min sitting time. The waitresses didn't mind & allowed us more than the 10 mins I requested for.
5
I found Wild Honey online when I looked for brunch places in Singapore and I was so impressed by the place that I went back 3 times during my 5 day trip. The food was excellent, the service, impeccable and brilliant ambiance. It's a testament to how popular the place if because they only let you have a table for 90 minutes - I would have loved to stay longer and order more food! It was one of the highlights of my trip and I will definitely be back the next time
5
First time trying after all the good review. But we didn't set our expectation too high in case we are disappointed. It turn out that the food was awesome! The decor was posh for a All Day Breakfast place. Atmosphere was great. Food was abit on the pricy side but worth going for a special occasion.
3
Arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and were promptly shown a table (a plus). Before sitting down, the server told us we would have to leave in 90 minutes. We asked for water and were told water was "self service" and were directed to a table. I asked for a modification on my meal (no sturgeon please) and the waitress said she would have to ask the chef. We tried to order cocktails-the house cocktails are very sugary, but the menu says classic cocktails available on request. We requested classic cocktails but the bartender would not make them (CANNOT). Food came out quickly (a plus), but was very rich. Terrible coffee and bad rendition of Jimi Hendrix music added to the ambience. All in all, an unfortunate experience, and we quickly retreated to P.S. Cafe for fabulous cocktails, and a mellow brunch atmospher
5
Great place for a light dinner just opposite my yoga studio. Great outdoor dining areas with little plants around. The cranberry scone is really delicious with real cranberry jam pairing with butter jam. Definitely be back again for more selection of food ^^ Please treat the staff well as some of them are still students, doing part time job in this lovely cafe 
4
Great place for brunch! Extensive and varied menu. The food was delicious and filling. I had the Spanish breakfast and my partner had the Canadian.You can reserve on an app at the door which calls you back when your table is ready - excellent idea as it is extremely busy.Only negatives- Need wifi and water service (the waitress just told is to serve ourself which was odd for the type of restaurant and number of staff available
3
Food was not too bad and maintained the standard since my last visit however plates and glasses were not clean. Considering the prices and location I would expect a little more attention to detail
4
There is only breakfasts all-day here, so menu is fixed and limited throughout the day. They are, however, all well done. My favorite is their signature English (with Eggs Benedict in it).
4
Food was good. Nice ambience for small group meet ups. We went in a group of 4, cozy setting. Overall a pleasant experience.
5
The service staff were very good. The food was very exquisite and it tasted good. Presentation and tastes goes well in every dish.
3
Good food, great place n nice ambience with friends. But service was not up to expectation, we were "forced" to return our table to the next customer even before my friend finish her food.
4
The quality and taste of the food didn't meet the level of the price. A bit pricey. The outdoor area is cozy and nice for chatting.
2
Food was so so and not worth the price. The restaurant tries to turn around tables fast and keeps asking whether the plates can be cleared (even when there is food on the plate) and when all was cleared they gave the bill without us asking. Even though the allocated 1.5 hrs was not up.
3
We went on a Saturday so naturally it was a busy time. The food is great, though I felt they were overpriced. The 90-minute limit to the seat was reasonable, though the staff could have positioned it differently. It felt they wanted you out ASAP, and you're just getting seated
4
I did not specifically request for a corner seat at the point of my online reservation, but was nevertheless delighted when I was ushered to my seat. It was a very cosy corner, but I was also afraid that I would be neglected if we were put into a corner. However, we experienced the most attentive staff and servers alike who were quick to come to attend to us whenever we needed something. One of the best places to consider for a cosy chat with your loved ones while enjoying brunch
1
Reserved for a table for 5 but was given a 4 pax table. Requested for a chair and was given a chair too high for the table. The staff asked manager/ supervisor for help. Manager / supervisor came over and ask me "why" . Instead of asking politely he asked me "why
4
Nice food. Good environment. Ordered English & European breakfast & serving is really big for the English breakfast.
3
The ambience of Wild Honey (Scotts Square) was nice and comfortable. Service staff were friendly too. But for that price we paid, the standard of food could have been higher.
5
Food is fabulous as usual and ambience and settings is perfect for this xmas season. Love it as always.
4
Portion of food served is acceptable but not for beverages, especially coffee. At that price, I would expect served portion to be a tad more generous.
5
Highly recommend for breakfast. Cool atmosphere and location. Great for business or vacation. Excellent service too!

Recommended by my brother for their waffles, I just couldn't leave Singapore without trying them.First we ordered food as we were starving and the food was just delicious. After that we ordered waffles and my brother was spot on, one of the best we have had. If it wasn't for the staff, this place deserves a maximum rating. The staff aren't rude, but they aren't really available as such. There appears to be many waiters but they aren't really attending to anyone and we needed to try hard to grab their attention. Regardless, I believe I have found my breakfast / brunch place on any future visits to Singapore.
3
Then you've got to go! Great place for brunch, breakfast or breakfast for lunch. I've been to both locations - Mandarin Gallery and Scotts Road - nice atmosphere and great coffee. Perfect for the holidays for friends and family. One piece of advice for Wild Honey - the restaurant is over-staffed but it's hard to get anyone's attention. The wait staff spend much time talking to one another or not looking at customers. To get noticed you need to call on the manager. You have enough staff, you may want to provide ''training'' on customer service. Reason for the low rating but the foods great
3
We were in the mood for eggs. I have been to the branch at Mandarin Gallery but not at Scotts Square. That's how we decided on this restaurant. Although the delicious breakfast spread lived up to its reputation, we found the service greatly lacking. The restaurant was obviously under-staffed. It took some effort to get the unmotivated waitress' attention. At 8.15pm, we were asked to place our last order, which we complied. While we were still half way through our main course, our dessert arrived! It struck me that the service team was impatient for us to finish our dinner and leave the restaurant so they could go home.Despite the chefs' good work, I am afraid the service team made the dinner unpalatable
5
My best friend took me for brunch to this restaurant. Very cozy, we picked the outdoor balcony as it is more private and also sitting inside is too cold for us. We love the interior and great service. Most importantly the food. I ordered the eggs benedict and cold brew coffee. She ordered juice and English breakfast. We both are satisfied with the meals provided with great quality. Will definitely be back to try out different menus
2
This is our 4th time at Wild Honey at Scotts Square. Food is always great, huge portions. However on this occasion the service really let's the experience down. My guest was running late, so after 10 minutes I asked for some water. Waiter said you had to get it yourself from the table, however minutes later I then observed him getting water for the two men outside. Based on that - probably wouldn't return to Scotts Square again, because on principle all customers should be given the same standard of service
5
Everyone has tried, but no one has dethroned Wild Honey yet! A little on the expensive side, but it has the best breakfast food and the best breakfast experience!
4
One of the widest variety of brunch options. Fresh ingredients used. Sumptuous breakfast portion. My friends enjoyed the experience.
4
Three weeks visited this area.i try nine menu already. I hope keep in touch this place .now a day special season song also well.
3
We just find the food and drinks are okay. The melon fruity drink is quite an acquired taste so may not suit male customer who don't like the sour and herbal taste. No soft drinks selection though.
4
Nice ambience for getting together with friends or initimate one with a loved one.
Cosy furnishings and gentle lighting set an easy mood to stomach the all day breakfast selections.
4
Positives: - ambiance, variety of choice, presentation and quality of foodNegatives:- cumbersome bureaucratic registration and waiting process, size of meals relatively small compared to the price (expensive), table occupation time limit of 90 minutes, staff service uncoordinated (4 different people were serving me...!) and slightly snobbish and attentiveness below averageI will give them another chance and go there once again, but will lower my expectations and maybe avoid renewed disappointment
4
Booking online was easy and highly recommended. A reminder / reconfirmation automated message was received on the day of my booking. Staff were friendly and the overall service was efficient. Restaurant ambience was clean, bright and spacious. Although a little expensive, the full English breakfast I ordered was delicious as was the hot chocolate.
1
This used to be the best breakfast place in Singapore but now:1. No specials;2. If you can't finish your food, you can't take it away unless you sign a legal release;3. You can have water, but ice with that will cost you a dollar;4. Price of entrees has almost doubled.Don"t bother, its now a clip joint for hipsters, that must be owned by lawyers
5
We had a very warm welcome from the Host and had a very nice outside table over Orchard road. All four breakfasts were delicious - recommend the Norwegian with its perfectly cooked asparagus and also my son had a pulled pork sandwich which he really enjoyed. The hot chocolate a favourite. The service was attentive and friendly and we are definitely returning

We (3 adults and 1 baby) visited  Wild Honey for a Sunday Brunch.We had booked in advance, a table for 4 to make sure we have enough room.When we arrived, they led us to a table for 3 and "ordered" us to park the baby stroller outside, since the table didnt have enough room. My baby had been sleeping.So I had to get my sleepy baby out of the stroller and make him sit on the high chair.Of course there were other bigger tables available but they didnt give us those which would have allowed my baby to sleep peacefully.While we were ordering, we were told we needed to vacate the table in 90 min. Okay!They took 20 min to serve the food (3 main courses for the three of us).Once the food arrived, we started gobbling it down quickly.With 30 min still left out of the 90 min allocation, I requested for a menu card to order for desserts.I asked thrice for the menu, but the waiters would just disappear.  The 4th one got the restaurant usher with him and she informed that we CANNOT order anything more because our 90 min was going to be up by the time the desserts are served. How ridiculous is that! Anyways so we gave up on the desserts.I was trying to quickly finish feeding my cranky sleepy baby his cerelac when the waiter returns. This time demanding we clear the bill because we have only 15 more minutes before we have to vacate the table. And they almost stood at our table till we paid, the pressure was so much.Needless to add, we could not finish my babys feed and honestly, by then we had given up expecting any kind of courtesy from the restaurant.While the food is good, the experience put us off so much that we will never ever want to go there again.All that I recall from our lunch experience is the arrogance of the staff and the clock ticking away in our heads. Btw I read about many such horrible service experiences at Wild honey from other diners before me on other social media sites, (wish i had looked them up before going there) and I can tell that it hasnot had any impact on Wild Honey. They clearly dont believe in acting upon customer feedback. Thus, I do not expect the restaurant to do anything positive with my feedback as well.HOWEVER I have to admit though, if anyone wants to get their meals timed and test out your abilities to eat under stress, this is THE place to go to!!
4
Food's good. Great ambience. Except prices were a little on the high side. Ordered the European and the Coconut Cake shared with my friend. Both items were good and so was the roasted almond Latte.
4
Loved the food. One of the best brunch places in Town! Would definitely head back there again for lunch/dinner:)
5
The food variety is great and it makes me difficult to choose from the wide array of breakfast choices. My husband and I enjoyed our food thoroughly. The service staff were quick and efficient and we enjoyed our brunch.
1
I was very shocked to receive such poor service on my last visit. Clearly they need to invest in training their staff.
3
Did not allow for adjusting any of the menu even if due to dietary restrictions
Drinks were brought out late and took forever to come even though we were ones of the first parties for breakfast.
4
Good place for catching up with friends. Great coffee! There is room for improvement for food though!
5
The deco was perfect for catch up with friends. Taste for food 🍲was up to expectations however it would be better if they could add sides to perfect the dish!
5
Great Ambiance was there to meet a friend whom i did not see in a long time. The food was really good. The almond latte was made very uniquely it was in ice cubes and came with hot milk and almond syrup which you can pour the amount you want. Overall great experience
3
It was disappointing that we had to wait at least 10mins despite having made a reservation. After showing us to our table, the staff seemed quite urgent to take our order. We do understand that we have only 90mins at the table, but please allow us some time to go through the menu (especially when it is all words and no pictures for us to refer to). Our birthday cake (bought at Wild Honey) arrived after all plates have been cleared and unfortunately, it was past the 90mins. Showing no mercy or understanding, the staff was standing beside our table to rush us through "making a wish, blowing the candle and cake cutting" and immediately took the cake away to pack in a box as time was up and we are not allowed to eat the cake at our seats
3
We visited on a public holiday. Once we sit down, the waiter can't wait to tell us we need to leave in 1.5hrs time. Then he walked away quickly. When we placed our order... one of my friends asked for plain water as her stomach was not well that day. The waiter pointed to a table some distance away and say please take yourself. I thought they should hv served it together with our ordered drinks instead of asking is to take ourself. Otherwise the food is good but service yet to improve
4
This is my favourite hangout place for brunch or breakfast items along Orchard Road. Good food and coffee. Service standard has deteriorate over the past years. Though pricey for breakfast, the ambiance is good for intimate gathering.
4
Hearty breakfast with good portions. Atmosphere is great. Suitable for meeting with friends (or simple business). Hot drinks need to be hotter for an even better experience
4
Food quality, presentation and taste is excellent. The coffee needs improving. Unfortunately so do the staff. They need to improve their quality of service and learn to anticipate customers needs.
4
Great food but will still prefer them to change some of the items on the menu once in a while. Or introduce a "Dish of the Month" kinda gimmick. You know, some variety of sorts.
2
It is not a place for a business luncheon when staff tells you 3 times that they need the table back by 1pm when they took your food order at noon.
4
We turned up 10 mins early and was shown to a table after they verified my booking. In no time, our order was served up. food was good:)
3
I have been to Wild Honey numerous times, right from the beginning when they first opened in Mandarin Gallery. Recently, they implemented a 90-min seating rule for patrons where one can only occupy the table for 90min before they will be asked to leave. Considering that food takes approximately 15min to be served, patrons technically have to rush through their meals while trying to chat with their friends at the same time. Personally, I appreciate the wide variety in their menu, but the 90-min rule makes the meal less than enjoyable for someone who just wants to slowly taste their food and have a nice catch-up session with friends.
2
I'm a regular customer of Wild Honey (Scott's branch) and will always recommend this place to friends and family. However, my last visit to Wild Honey was pretty disappointing. The Menu is still the same, and it makes it boring. That's the main reason why this visit (myself and my mum), we only ordered one dish to share. Nothing in the menu seems to attract me anymore. Then is the service. Its really difficult to get service staff attention, and I have to get out of my seat and walk towards them. This can be really frustration, especially when I'm in the middle of eating my food. I hope Wild Honey will continue to innovate and refresh your menu once a while. Thank youwith regards,Audrey Won
4
We had a reservation for 2 adults and 1 child. They screwed up and wanted to put us in the middle of a long table but there was no way that we could squeeze in. They wanted to put our 7 year old child in a child seat so all 3 of us could fit in. I stood my ground and said no. Finally, the manager (I think) came and told us that they would give us a proper table. And he also brought the fried cheese ball as complimentary. So we were happy and would consider going back again.
2
I was very excited about going to Wild Honey because they had the most amazingly range of breakfast dishes. Being pregnant, I asked for mine to be served with well cooked scrambled eggs rather than poached as the medical advice is not to have runny eggs. Cue discussion with waitress - "you can't exchange things on the menu". I explained that this wasn't a whim, but on medical advice. She said she's speak to the Chef. Apparently the Chef would not allow me to swap. I asked to speak to someone else. I was told I was allowed hard boiled poached eggs... In the end I asked to just have the breakfast without eggs at all. And it arrived. With runny poached eggs. Which, as soon as I tried to remove them from the plate, broke and covered everything in egg yolk. Add to that the poor service - I asked for water two or three times, we asked for coffee twice (having waited 20 minutes for it to arrive) and I have to say Thanks wild honey. You may have good reviews but I think you're a bit up yourselves and incredibly unhelpful
4
The environment is good and there are many choices for breakfast on the menu. Service is good. Except the price is on the steep side.
4
I always love going here. Quality of the dishes are consistently great. I am always up for an all day breakfast! Their cakes are also yummy. The best hot frank: Wild Mocha Dolce
4
the breakfast portion is very break,and location is very strategic which is near to mrt station and shopping hotsport.have 2wild honey in orchard area,however I found that scoot square wild honey has better customer service
4
Nice ambience with ok service. Portions for the breakfast sets are smaller when compared to my previous visits.
5
Absolutely loved the whole ambiance , great food and excellent service. Keep it up !!! There was more drink choices and dessert choices on the menu. Nevertheless Its apparent that is a restaurant that provides good service with quality food.
4
My second visit to wild honey. One of my favourite places for breakfast food. They could include spicier options in the menu.
3
I have been visiting Wild Honey for over 2 years. I think the success of the place over the years has got snob factor into the management of the restaurant. For ex, as soon as you book the restaurant, you get an email that the seating is only valid for 90 minutes. As soon as we sat down, the hostess, mentioned the same things to my wife. We went with our 2 year old. It is really annoying that even before you sit, the restaurant tells you that you are only welcome for 90 minutes; as if they are doing us a favor. I then noticed that we did not get serve for 15 minutes. It was only when I waved my arm, did we get a waiter to come over to our table. Please remember technology cannot overcome service in a services industry. Secondly, the consistency of the food is getting more unpredictable. We are paying full or more price for the food and if the service is not going to be polite, food is inconsistent then why would one visit this restaurant. Third, water is no more served. It is now self-service!! I think the management really needs to take a step back and figure out the clientele they are targeting. Can you imagine, being a frequent visitor for 2 years and so far no host even recognizes or acknowledges a regular patron but does not forget to remind you that you are only welcome for 90 minutes.

Wild Honey serves yummy breakfasts from around the world, all day long. The two branches have slightly different menus, so you may want to try both. I am a big fan of the Flinders Street (only at Scotts Square restaurant) and my husband loves the steak sandwich. The espresso coffee is decent and juices are lovely. However you can get equally fresh and tasty juices for $2 at almost any hawker centre, compared to the $9 Wild Honey are asking.Both restaurants are comfortable and decor has a pleasingly bohemian vibe.Make sure you book on weekends, or you will be waiting up to an hour or more to get in

what stood out most is how quickly i was seated when I had made a reservation. What happens at most other restaurants is that you STILL wait for at least a good 10-15 minutes for seating to be arranged despite making a reservation. This makes for efficient seating and quick turn over so that people eat within their allotted time and leave as new patrons come in. Overall pleasant brunch experience. 
4
Service was good, quality of food is also good but pricy. Restaurant is a little noisy due to the large crowd that afternoon. Friends enjoyed the brunch there for the first time. Good experience. If you want a table inside the restaurant, you must call the restaurant to reserve it.

Pretty alright but we weren't inform tt e last order is 8.15pm when we made e reservation at 8.15pm.
4
Better have picture to review the menu. Overall good. Service nice. Food ok. Environment good for small group chatting.

When I was ready to order my food. I have raise my hand for a few times and no one attend to me. It was quite frustrated.
5
A great place to start the day with a full menue of any breakfast you wish. Bright open seating. Food was hot and delicious. I would go back again.

A great reward for oversleeping. Since our hotel had stopped serving breakfast, we went in search of something different and stumbled into Wild Honey - across the street from our hotel. What a fantastic surprise. This is a relatively new location for this chain and they're only open Sunday - Thursday but definitely worth making the time to visit. I had the coconut-mango-banana waffles with an indescribably delicious syrup that was unlike anything I've ever tasted and Michael had, in his words, "the best Eggs Benedict ever."
4
I came to Wild Honey with my mom for a nice brunch. We really enjoyed the food and could taste the good quality of ingredients, but the prices are not cheap so you get what you pay for. My mom had the grilled salmon and I had the eggs Benedict, both were very tasty.The cappuccino was not weak, which is how I like it. The furniture and ambience were nice, but the service was nothing spectacular. The host felt cold and slightly annoyed . Overall we found the food great, but didn't give five start rating because they can improve on their service.

Accessible by Orchard MRT station, short 5 minute walk via the underpass.Was there on a Monday at 7pm for a drink and snacks. Price about SGD20-odd per person for a glass of white wine and a portion of Brazilian bread (shared).Ambience - nice and quiet. Seems more like a place for ladies to unwind or first-date type place. Staff - polite and attentive. I think the place gets more packed as the evening progresses. We managed to get a table without waiting since we were early. Didn't try the food, perhaps next time.I'd recommend the Brazilian bread. Good comfort food and washes down well with white wine . Selection of wine is limited but decent. Plus they do cocktails too.Adeline LeeDiner - Drinks / Snacks12 October 201

We are a group of 11 and the online booking was a breeze with a automated called to remind us of the booking at 12. At the restaurant food order was of great portion and could last us for quite a while, recommended the English breakfast, till 6 we are still pretty full
4
It was quiet and cosy. Good environment for birthday Celebration. The staff was very helpful when i call in to request for a sliced of cake for surprise. the staff even go extra mile naming and describing the cake to me so that i can choose. They even offer to write my wishes on the cake. Awesome servic
1
I have visited Wild Honey on a number of occasions over the last 3 years. This was by far the worst experience I have had. The service staff were so non-attentive and seemingly off with the fairies, that I continuously needed to wave to get there attention. The food choice was limited and expensive for what was presented. I won't be returning
5
Friendly staff and great ambience! Standard of food is consistent as well :) One of the best brunch places in Sg!
5
Nice visit and good food. Would recommend more scrambled eggs than current portion for the children's menu dish.
3
Their menu and food need improvement to stand out from the rest. Fairly decent place for brunch though :)
4
Would've been better if we could be there for more then 90 minutes!
Great service, great food thou. Thanks Wild honey!
5
The reservation was excellent as the best seats were given to us. The staffs were very friendly and professional.
3
I dont like to be kept reminding by the staff on the time limit spent for dining. which is about 1.30hour.
5
Wild honey serves different types of all-day breakfast. The dishes that we have ordered so far were tasty, big in portion and always left us satisfied and happy. Nice place to sit and chat with a friend or a group of friends. They open quite early in the morning, so def one of the places that is worth considering to have breakfast brunch date
3
I'm a regular at Wild Honey. Though I would still return / recommend others to dine there (at least for now), here are some suggestions specific to the dishes that we have ordered:- Aussie: Reckon that the cut of beef in the past was much better (i.e. during the time when 2 different sizes were offered). I thought it was sirloin that was served previously but can't be sure. Whatever the case is, the rump that is being served currently is really tough! Would not be ordering this dish again anytime soon (or at least till the cut of beef is changed). And one more thing: the chef at Mandarin outlet can't cook this dish! It either turned out well-done or rare (I ordered medium rare and the chef was given 2 chances!). Though the chef at Scotts can do a better job at this, I am deterred to order this dish again due to the reason stated above.- Canadian: Pancakes were not as fluffy as I would have expected it to be. Had much better ones at Jamie Italian weekend brunch recently at a lower price.Feel that the quality of food has somewhat decreased during my recent 2 visits and doesn't quite match up with the price point. Hope to see improvements soon
3
I somehow feel the quality is not as fantastic as before. The coconut cake we ordered is quite disappointing. It might be because there was a big group of gathering, so it was pretty noisy that day I visited with 2 friends. Wished to have quiet corner to ourselves...
5
Our favorite brunch place - food is delicious and ingredients are so fresh. Favorites are the Norwegian, Kale Caesar salad and Mediterranean vegetable sandwich. The classic breakfast brunch meals are done with simplicity and genuine home made taste & salads are healthy and yummy. Bravo to the chef!One recommendation to the restaurant would be to have a kids menu as the portions are generous (and 18$-22$+ for a young kid's breakfast is a little pricey)
4
service was good even when we called in to inform of our late arrival. Staffs were attentive, food was served quickly.
3
Restaurant's setting was nice, food was good but coffee wasn't impressive. The service was ok. The 90-minute limit is tight especially for bigger group.
4
It was an awesome experience ! Norwegian all day English breakfast and a cup of flat white was all I took. They are made with above average quality ingredients and this has pampered my gastric.
4
Gotta love the taste and presentation of the food. Was quite intrigued when my iced hazelnut latte came in the form of ice cubes! Been a patron of Wild Honey and will continue to go there!
4
It's excellent. Good and ambiance are great. I would suggest to have more choices of side dishes and dessert
2
Had dinner here for the frst time after quite a few visits at luchtime in the past. Service has always been slow but it has usually also been busy. For dinner at 8pm on a Saturday night there were probably 5 tables and at least the same amount of staff on the floor. Yet service wast the slowest I have ever experienced. Funny as the staff were tired and seemed like they just wanted to go home which should have prompted them to do a speedy service but alas did not. The food was quite good as it usually is - just a shame it takes so long even to get a drink or a bottle of water, let alone the meal itself. We finished off with two french press coffees which had so liitle cofee in them the color was like tea. Ftom asking for the dessert menu to being served the coffee more than half an hour went by. The thing to improve on is staff - don't only rely on 15 year old school kids to be bable to do the job as clearly they can't.
3
cozy ambience but a lil too dim. couldnt take a nice ootd of my dish. surprisingly empty on a fri evening.read many positive reviews online but they were dated. (~2010-2013)maybe that's why i was quite disappointed with the food which wasn't fantastic (drop in standard perhaps).Had the tuniscisn(sp??) breakfast which wasn't piping hot/cooled down rlly fast. and there was almost too little soup/sauce for the dippings of my Brioche bread (toasted and crusty). Enjoyed the eggs (yolk still runny) tho.The sliced sausages tasted weird/too salty, prefer the English breakfast's cumberland sausage much more. Cldn't wait to try the highly raved diced fried potatoes in the English breakfast but they were just okayish. One of my friends ordered the Scandinavian bf. i tried the rosti looking thing below the salmon - didnt rlly taste like rosti (as in like Marche) but was crispy and very dry.Wrapped up with their choco covered orange chiffon cake which was light and delectable
2
I've been to the wild honey at mandarin and decided to try the one at scotts for a change. The food was however very disappointing. While portions were large, they were mostly loaded with salt. Apart from Brazilian bread (which never disappoints) the I love New York dish was not up to expectations. I did not expect the smoked salmon to be cooked with the below average scrambled eggs and the cream cheese was pretty tasteless. Even Philadelphia cheese spread taste better. Overall largely disappointing and considering the prices it would take a lot of convincing for me to go back.
4
From online reservations through to bill payment, it was an easy, straight forward experience at Wild Honey Scott's. Good ambience, wholesome food and adequately efficient service. I think though, that their success could be a stumbling block to more personalised service. Staff were efficient but mechanical, and smiles could be more generously accorded to customers. Pastry basket was a bit on the thin side for the price charged.
4
Food came in good size and tasted good. Ambience is welcoming. Service is so so. Downside of it was the limited time given to diners to occupy the table. It may seem enough for quick diners but not for the take ur time and chat diners. Although they didn't chase us out but as diners we felt the pressure to do time check and made sure we didn't exceed the time. 
4
The presentation of food is nice, is fast, and filling for big eater like my husband which we ate as dinner. In addition, the service is excellent too.
3
No privacy perhaps due to the seats we were assigned. Waitresses were talking and standing too near our table throughout our breakfast. Who enjoys someone breathing down our necks when we eat?
4
Very good service and nice ambience to enjoy my brunch. It is not noisy and able to chat with your friends and partner.
4
The menu spread was just mind-blowing. Ordered Brittany, Flinder's Lane and Californian ... all excellent. But price is too expensive and will only make a visit to Wild Honey "once in a very blue moon", or only if I get invited.
3
So this place looks good and it's in a great location just off orchard road. We went here on the recommendation of a friend. Our waiter was kurt at best but not welcoming or particularly friendly. Our children certainly were not made welcome and when I asked for something simple like poached eggs on toast for my son I'm told no. Something as simple as eggs and toast should be available as a side item on any breakfast style venue. I then ask for just toast and again I'm told no and have to go for some bread basket special. I had the European my husband had the English to be honest it was expensive for what it was even by Singapore standards and pretty mediocre at best. Sadly I would not recommend this place and I will not be returning when there are so many other great breakfast places that are better priced and your made to feel welcome.
4
The food options were plentiful and tasty and the chocolate milkshake was really good! Had a great time catching up with my friend whilst we were there, but it would have been nice if the waitress came over earlier to take our order. It took her 30mins to ask us what we'd like to order and then we were rushed to finish eating so we could give our table to the next reservation.
1
I used to love this place but this is the last time I will go. Service was never amazing but has now reached ridiculous levels, food was cold and they brought the bill before even clearing the plates away. This used to be popular for a reason but I am sure the wait for tables will decrease as people realise it just isn't good anymore.
3
Lots of people had told me it's a good place for brunch but upon arriving there, it was so crowded and you don't have much privacy while dining as we ended up sharing a table with other patrons. Food was of average quality (or I just had higher expectations of it?). The coffee was a let down as I don't fancy coffee which are more acidic
2
The food was not bad -- especially the brioche -- so were the ambience and service. Unfortunately, the house-pour coffee was too acidic without milk / sugar, and there was no other choice. This is forgiveable. But then we were abruptly asked to leave the restaurant to make room for a party with a reservation specifically at the table we were occupying, even though there were many other unoccupied seats. We were never told there was a time limit, nor were we invited to move to another table or perch -- never mind that we were midway through a second round of drinks. The whole experience was marred by bad management. Clearly, an $80 bill does not even buy time to talk shop for a couple of hours. This does not happen in the basement Olio Dome outlet, where the atmosphere is welcoming and conducive. Prices are way more reasonable too. In fact, even in next-door hotel, Hyatt, prices, ambience and service are far better. Wild Honey's food and coffee are not spectacular enough compared to these two other options, and its atmosphere is too calculating to make it a good business meeting experience
3
I was here another day and I enjoyed it so much that I came back with a friend. unfortunately the experience was not the same. I was early and came to the restaurant and browsed through the menu at the entrance, a staff was right there but didn't even acknowledge me at all. I then just walked away and waited for my friend to arrive. My bagel was as hard as a rock and I left it untouched but when the waiter cleared the plate she didn't bother to even ask if all was ok. The staff are just doing their tasks and not really attentive to my needs. I love the ambience, and would love to come back but will have to think it over.
5
Had an awesome brunch here, locally recommended and really busy a hive of people enjoying good food 🍲
3
We are there a bit early and we did have reservation. The food was great but the service is not just matching up the price they charge. No smile, everything is just like "things to be done" kind of attitude.
3
Food was good but The first waitress forgot to key in our order and we waited 20 mins before they realized that our order wasn't being cooked. By the time our order arrived, we were too hungry to really savor the food.
5
"European" breakfast was delicious - poached eggs cooked to perfection, tasty hollandaise sauce, mushrooms and prosciutto made an excellent combination. Coffee good too if not a little small (the restaurant might want to offer a large option). Good atmosphere. Hard to beat.
5
I was greeted early morning with a genuine smile at the door. The ambience is cozy and the service was fast. Food is excellent. It would be better if the menu comes with pictures of the delicious food they prepare.
2
We used to like this place. The service has really become an issue ...we are now beeing asked to stand up and get our own water !! The waiters and waitresses have now been trained to be arrogant ( no worry they are still incompetent ! ) There is actually a huge turnover in personnel and no leadership . The portions have been reduced , and the food is not that good anymore. This said..the queues are still very long so I am sure that they will survive and do fine , but we long the old place. . Won't go bac
3
Wild Honey is an institution in Singapore however going there for breakfast on Saturday I was a little disappointed. The restaurant just lacked something not sure if it was not busy and the normal hustle and bustle. Normally we sit and enjoy our time there but were in and out in 30 minutes and the food and service was just below that normal exceptional standard. However we will be back maybe it was just an off day. Thank you
4
We came on a Sunday afternoon disappointed find out that we had to wait "> 60 min". Much to our surprise, after keying in the number of seats we needed, we instantly got a call to say that they had available seats!We had an enjoyable time having the delectable Norwegian, tasty European and usual English as mains and a warmed up scone for dessert. We also had an iced mocha and a cappuccino.The food came promptly but desserts were a little slow
4
All round quite pleasant, all food was cooked as expected Canadian, Norwegian and Tunisian. The coffee was hot and not burnt....food delivery was a bit slow but it was full with lots of people milling at the door. The best part was the kids were entertained by all of the activity, noise and colour. Far from perfect but solid nonetheless
4
This is a cool little restaurant serving all day breakfasts from around the world with matching drinks of all kinds. You can have any kind of breakfast you like and it's big and tasty. Service is pretty good and it's pretty chilled layout and place, often frequented by ladies who lunch and weekend's have more families and groups of friends. good place to get great big breakfast
3
Great place with all day breakfast. Food quality very average though. The potatoes & eggs were cold. Loved the pancakes.
2
I was charged for a glass of prossecco when it should have been complimentary. When I tried calling to get the charge corrected, I simply could not get through to them.
3
Service is good. Ambience is nice and lively. Food however not up to hype. Average food. We had norwegian and Spanish . corned beef was dry.
5
This is my 2nd visit. A great place to get your coffee fixed especially when tired shopping around Orchard. Serves good food too. Highly recommended.
4
The food are fresh (I'm referring to the greens and bread). The ambience was cozy, nice and make you feel like home---casual dining with elegance furniture.Advise to make reservation in advance to avoid disappointment, I went they (Scotts Square outlet) during weekday lunch hour, it was quite pack
3
You would think that with the booming F&B industry in the country they would like to step it up a notch in the service. But noooo... The hostess was haughty and the waitress, when we asked for a glass of warm water, replied,"The water is there. You can get it yourself.
3
We have been a couple of times to both their locations. The food is good although they are a bit conservative on sauces, etc. What really bothers is that it is not a relaxing visit. After seating us, the hostess said "you have 90 minutes for your meal and the 90 minutes starts now). Never in all my visits to numerous restaurants around the world have I been restricted to a set time. On top of it, they contradict themselves as they are the ones who are slow in getting you the check
1
I had breakfast there last Sunday which was good. Then I ordered a steak sandwich to-go and requested medium well. It was for my son who later on said it was too chewy and not good at all. Later on, we realized the meat was nearly raw. That night, my son had to go to the A&E and got diagnosed with bacteria! So now even if my breakfast was not bad, I have a bad experience with this resto
3
Food was nice except for a rather tough bacon... more like chaotah bakwa. Was greeted by a sulky faced gatekeeper. Reserved table via Chope and understood we were given only given the table for 90 mins. Arrived late for 15 mins and gatekeeper said we were only left with 60 mins. Ought to be 75 mins but wasn't in the mood for dispute. 60 mins was fine as service was efficient. Overall, the dining experience was cool albeit with a 'black face' lingering around
5
The full English is incredible, the bacon and sausage top quality. The decor is very cool and the place oozes a young cool vibe. Meal for two with some juices set us back SGD80 which is on the expensive side though believe me, it is worth the price
5
Great food. Love the ambience. Great place to relax and chat with girlfriends. Will definitely go back.
3
This is one of the long standing brunch places considering that a dozen or so brunch and cafes spring up ever so often. The variety of food here is good but I thought the prices were steep. After all,it is only breakfast..
5
The omelettes tasted great and the portion was a good size! The atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was lovely. Great location from four seasons. Would make a good place for brunch too.
5
Had always been a fan of Wild Honey but thought we visit the chain at Scotts Square for a change. We made a reservation to avoid disappointment and was there 20mins before our reservation. Was ushered in cordially nonetheless when they opened their doors at the stroke of 9am. Very pleasant and friendly lady greeted us at the door before we were ushered to our seats. Nice corner with very comfy armchair. We ordered, our orders came and it was one the best breakfast meal and experience we had.
5
I know it's a big call but our breakfast was the best breakfast we have had anywhere in the world (and we have eaten at A LOT of places). To drink I had the banoffee brûlée milkshake with flamed meringue and my partner had a raspberry and pineapple slushy. To eat I had poached eggs on brioche wrapped in prosciutto (minus the hollandaise) and my partner had french toast with banana, mascarpone and salted caramel. All food and drinks was outstanding! The service was good and the venue has a great vibe. If you're in Singapore, eat here - you won't regret it
3
Ok - I've now been to Wild Honey twice and both for a special occasion and you know what there are better options in Singapore these days.Booking a table - this can only be done via "Choppe" which is an automatic system, there is no way to talk to anyone which is honestly frustrating. No personal touch or customer experience.Arriving at the restaurant - nice setting, cool looking decor, very young funky and well presented staff. As soon as you are seated you are reminded that you can only have the table for 90mins - same thing you are told when you book via the Autobot reservations. Food is well presented and large portions, it's ok but not stellar - strangely everything seems to have eggs (ok not everything) My choice would be the Pancakes (nice and fluffy), I've ordered the Spanish Hash and both times be disappointed (not sure why I re-order it).Service is nice, polite but not overly friendly (not rude) - it's a little Autobot like......we know you are only here for 90mins, our restaurant is always booked out so really I couldn't care too much whether you stay or go (not rude). Our drinks (coffee, smoothy and juice) too ages, basically didn't arrive until we had finished the food. We followed up a couple of times and were told that it was coming, they were busy in the kitchen which I assume they are always. There was no apology, it was a simple smile like yeah this happens all the time and I'm use to it so should you.So would I go back? No. We gave it a 2nd chance and honestly there are so many other places in Singapore that really want and value your business and the food is just as good if not better.Sorry Wild Honey, you lost our business and recommendation but I get the feeling that you probably would care too much anyway - which is the problem :
2
I have been to Wild Honey Scotts many times. Unfortunately now I don't think I will be back. Went with my parents for brunch yesterday and service was terrible, food was cold and the overall experience was unpleasant. The only thing that arrived as and when was requested was the bill....Took 3 requests to 3 different staff to get some water, coffee orders weren't placed and meals were undercooked and cold. This used to be a good option for a reliable brunch but now I think they just want you in and out. Pity. 
5
This is exactly what one needs to start the weekend. I love the Norwegian! It's yummy and gorgeous! Smoked salmon wrapped around perfectly poached eggs with a dollop of salmon roe on top of avocado and bread. Wow...I also love love love their Curly Kale Salad! I don't know how to describe this beauty but it is so good that my 4 yr old wants her share of this salad. Best washed down with some Mellow Yellow too
1
I was there hosting some business guests for brunch. First of all, the food was not great. Then about 2 hours into the brunch and business discussion, the staff came twice to invite us to leave. Then the manager came to say that the house rule is that each table is only given two hours to dine. She replied no when I asked her whether the house rule was communicated before guests were seated or published in any way. I am ok for house rules but make sure it is upfront so that I can opt to go elsewhere if I know that my brunch meeting would go beyond 2 hours
5
Went to Wild Honey on a Tuesday for lunch with my daughters. With a 19 and 18 year old it's rare that we all agree on things however this was one that we did! I had a really good Spanish Hash with both girls having a bacon and egg breakfast, and with good coffees and good service definitely a 5/5
3
The food is not bad, so is the atmosphere. The staff also pretty attentive. But maybe you need to wait a bit longer than usual cause it is pretty crowded. Strongly recommend you to make reservation instead of going down just like that.
3
The food was decent but the ambience was totally spoilt with the Bollywood-like music. Totally unrelaxed dining with that kind of music.
4
Attentive service provide.
Beautiful food.
Nice ambience.
Nothing unpleasant to mention.
Best brunch i had so far.
4
Great ambience for chilling out and service was prompt. The food is great but a little bit on the pricey side.
5
The decor is beautiful, really elegant and exotic. We had good service and superb food. So much choice that I definitely want to come back soon. I chose the Tunisian breakfast which was a lovely warmingly spiced stew, very comforting and really tasty. The chunks of brioche toast are amazing and would go well with all the breakfast options. Next I want to try a sweet option, maybe a savoury first followed by a sweet! Mmmmm yummy. Well priced and I loved the Wild Honey Iced Tea with sugar syrup, ,are sure you try it
1
If you are looking for a relaxing brunch spot around Orchard on a weekend - Do Not Go Here! Apparently on the weekends they have a 60 minute seating allowance per table. We were not aware of this until the waitress came to our table and promptly served the billed and told us it was time to leave. Excuse me??? We didn't ask for the bill, nor were we informed of the time allowance per table upon entering the cafe. I wanted to order another coffee, but was told I could not..."It's time to leave or you could move to a bar stool" Again....WHAT??? In saying this I should also note that there were at least six empty tables. Therefore if you are looking for a relaxing brunch and want to enjoy the company of your dining companions, STAY AWAY from here. Your meal will be rushed and you will feel that an $80 breakfast for two people an outrage if you're not able to enjoy it
4
It was our 1st time dining at WH, and we enjoyed the food very much.Between the 4 of us, we ordered 2 English, a Norwegian, canadian and a Bernard st michel. Everything was yummy and the portions were huge! We could barely finish hence its recommended to share especially for the ladies.ordering was fuss free and food was served rather quickly. Ambience was great but felt a little pressure to finish up our meal as we were told that we only had 90 mins for the table. Service wise was professional although it was a little rigid and cold. Wait staff accomodates requests but there was barely any warmth in the interaction. Refill of water was inconsistent as some of our glasses were refilled while the rest weren't.Nevertheless, its worth a return visit purely for the food and ambience
4
Celebrated Father's Day early at Wild Honey. Brought my folks who've never been there, and everyone enjoyed it. Mom's vegetarian, so she was thrilled there were vege options... she had the portobello mushroom dish, the rest of us shared 3 other dishes (Norwegian - always a winner!, Spanish hash - not really great, and Boulevard St Michel's - which was also yummy). All in all, it was a lovely lunch, and Wild Honey has always been terribly busy whenever I visit. Sometimes, one needs to be a little patient to attract the attention of the servers
4
Food was great. However, the moment we entered we were told we had 90 minutes. That is more than enough time for a nice brunch, but being told that was a total put-off. Staff were in a hurry to take the order. Not a peaceful and relaxed meal.
1
Ordered three different breakfast - I Love NY, English and Hangover. One comment for all; terrible quality!Each was stuffed with plenty of eggs making it looks like value for money perhaps. The food quality is also poor with the type of sausage and salmon was absolutely fishy. I didn't even finish a quarter of the I Love NY yet the waitress didn't bother to ask and I also didn't bother to explain with the attitude. Total damage of $92 without drinks is way over priced. Rather, over rated! Sorry won't return and definitely won't recommend.
5
It's actually possible to eat breakfast all day long. With coffe and cakes to complete the meal. Prices are a tad high though.
4
Nice ambience and quality food served. not cheap certainly, main+drink average S$30+ per person. however this is my to-go place for all day breakfast.
4
This trip to wild honey was different again, dishes differed slightly in taste and standards vis-a-vis other outlets. However the service in this Scotts Square outlet was still the best :)
4
Brought my grandma there to have an advanced Mothers day treat. She's overall happy and satisfied with our meal. Will definitely bring her there again.
4
Had a quiet and nice birthday dinner with my sis and her kids. It was quiet on a Friday night. Quality time well spent with sumptuous food and ambience. It was my 2nd visit to the Wild Honey @ Scotts, love it totally. Will visit again
5
This restaurant is on the top floor of Scott's Square. My friend and I didn't have a reservation but we were lucky enough to get a table as it was very busy.The menu has a lot of breakfast items to choose from. They also have a selection of vegetarian meals which was great for my friend. I ordered the salmon which had two pieces of Asparagus, two tomatoes and a hard, inedible deep fiend ball of noodles. This was $28. I my opinion mashed potatoes or even more vegetables would of been nice instead of the hard noodles.The service was good and the staff were friendly. Yes I would go back but I would have the salad the next time. That looked lovely and filling
3
I wouldn’t recommend Wild Honey as I don’t think it’s value for money. But I would still give it an average rating based on my review below. I haven’t tried everything in the menu but the tastes range from excellent to below average. The spanish hash and fried goat cheese salad, for example, are excellent. They have a different taste and worth recommending. On the other hand, the Monte Cubano sandwich was disappointing. Instead of spicy pulled pork, they used something that looked like pork floss. And the sandwich was dry — nothing like what a pulled pork sandwich should be like. The Under the Tuscan Sun vegetarian sandwich was equally underwhelming. The caramelized onions were just slathered in and the taste lacked any nuance. It was strictly average. I wouldn’t complain about average taste if it weren’t for the above-average prices. However, if you’re a hot chocolate fan, the Paris Hot Chocolate with marshmallow is amazingly good albeit less in quantity. Having said that, the service is excellent. Staff are attentive, cordial and polite. Another thing that put me off is that despite a reservation you get ONLY 90 mins to dine. I like my brunches to be a little longer than that so that I can be relaxed and have some good conversation instead of having to be constantly aware of the time. Interiors, furnishing and decor are pleasant and put well together. The seating is very comfortable as well

Our first visit to this outlet at Scotts Square and it was very disappointing. Did not live up to expectations as we had enjoyed our food at Mandarin Gallery. Waitress candidly said she was not the best person to give recommendations on wine (the selections were not many!) and no attempt was made to seek help from another staff, she just stood there expecting us to make the decision. Iced chocolate was more like milk with unmelted Hershey's syrup, even a carton of choclate milk tastes more chocolatey than Wild Honey's "Iced Chocolate". The food was equally disappointing. I asked for my potato rosti to be slightly more crispy, it was given to me burned. I could detect the burnt smell from my plate the moment it was served! The bacon was my husband's plate was hard and cold, seems to have been on the warmer for quite a while. Our first and last visit to Scotts Square Wild Honey for sure. No wonder it was empty on a Saturday night.

it starts with Wild Honey telling you about 4 times that you only have 90 minutes, it goes on to major changes in the menu (not necessarily good, am a creature of habit and I used to like my "I love NY" the way it was), to some of the basic things missing (like their original ice tea). I can probably live with most of that. I had a hard time being told after 65 min that our time was up and oh here is the bill, thank you very much. 5 minutes later, same message... we reminded the kind staff that 90 min was 25min more than that and that we would move in due time. Not completely unpleasant (they apologized), but not pleasant enough to think that I would go back soon. There are enough friendlier places around after all.
2
We were a big group of 10 and were rudely pushed out after 90 minutes. We spent quite a lot of money and were very surprised about this behaviour. When my friend tried to pay part of the bill on her credit card that was declined, we also returned one dish as there was a hair in it and they still tried to bill us. We sadly will not go back
5
The food was great and the service was very attentive overall it's a pleasant experience will definitely visit again
1
The place is too noisy and not an ideal place to relax. Also due to the popularity, the staff comes to fetch your bill too fast. I would not visit again.
5
Generous portions. Great quality. Coffee could have been better. Loved the English Breakfast. Best I've indulged in for a long time.
5
We've tried multiple places all over Singapore, and we always come back to Wild Honey. Best dish is the 'European'.
By far this is the best breakfast place in Singapore!

If you like eggs, you will love Wild Honey. They serve eggs with all type of meat accompaniments (steak, smoked salmon, avocado, asparagus, chorizo, etc). I had the norwegian and it was delicious. Just the right amount of hollandaise, eggs poached to perfection sitting on top of a toasted brioche. Pure perfection

After a few days of hotel buffet breakfasts we felt like a change. Wild Honey was recommended by the concierge at our hotel and it was easily one of the best recommendations of this trip. We arrived promptly at 9:00 on Sunday and it was crowded. The hostess quickly and efficiently organised a table even though we didn't have a reservation. Only restriction was you must be out in 90 minutes. We loved the huge variety of choices available and found the meals to be beautifully cooked, and extremely tasty and certainly filling. Fresh fruit juice and wonderful coffee certainly capped off a lovely meal. Love the decor and atmosphere too
4
Wiild Honey was recommended by our taxi driver for breakfast. We arrived on Saturday morning, without a reservation, and the hostess fitted us in, but we were told we could only have the table for one hour. The whole restaurant Had a nice atmosphere and was busy with families and a large group. There is also a small outdoor area on the balcony.The breakfast menu had a good selection of options, although pricey - and the service was prompt and attentive. We would go back again
2
A pair of crazy contractors moved furniture and lights and talked loudly while leaning on my chair to discuss their renovation plans for this place. It went on for 20 minutes while we were trying to have breakfast. Sadly no one seemed to be willing to stop them and their antisocial behaviour. I asked the staff about them and was told that renovations were planned. I guess customers were just expected to tolerate the intrusion and clown show. It certainly wasn't entertainment
4
Wild Honey is a nice all-day breakfast place. I love their french toast. They have a huge breakfast menu to choose from and also have a selection of sandwiches in case you visit them at lunch or dinner time. The ambiance is cosy and service is good
2
Wild honey has a fun atmosphere and delicious food. But their patio sat empty and they wouldn't seat us out there. (I had even made a reservation for 2 people ahead of time). And the service was very disappointing! It took forever to get drinks, then to flag someone to take our order. Forget asking us if we needed anything, how was the food. Then we had to beg for the bill. Ridiculous! I think there's a lot of potential but there's too many restaurants out there to return to one of such poor service.
2
nothing with shouting about. small portions, nothing special for my aussie set. $30 is better spend elsewhere. . not worth returning for sure! my partner's hangover was cold. ciabatta sandwich doesnt taste good cold. . sloppy. . nice decor though. cheers.
5
Went on a weekday and wasnt crowded at all.. sat there for 2 hrs without a move from the seat.. also, had a sumptuous brunch!
4
Was impressed with the no-hassle reservation. Just call and you'll receive a text message with a URL link to book the lunch reservation. On same day, you even get a reminder call about the reservation. Pretty cool!
Really easy and effortless!
5
I love this restaurant! I go to both branches and prefer Scott's, but am at one or the other at least once a week. I've never encountered bad or slow service that some reviewers mention. The food is always fresh, well-prepared and arrives looking gorgeous. Keep doing what you're doing, Wild Honey
3
The food was good. But the service was slow. I was concern with the time as we were told we can only have the table for an hour and a half. And I found being on a time limit with slow service just made the experience not that great for me. 
1
went a couple of weeks ago with some friends and my daughter, inspite of having a booking service at the counter where they ask you to choose indoor/outdoor seating, they gave us seating not to our choice on a shared table after a really long wait... staff were unfriendly, and super slow at serving drinks, would be one thing if it was the food was slow since the restaurant was packed, however not sure how long it takes to poor 3 glasses of prosecco, and to top the whole experience off, messed up the bill by charging the wrong credit cards, and not at all apologetic or any show of wanting to have repeat customers, poor choice of staff/service ethic given the umpteen brunch place options in Singapore... interesting to see multiple reviews of bad service

WHad 4 sets of English breakfast with my girlfriends and we agreed that the sausage had a strong pork smell, and most of us couldn't stomach the sausage after a few bites. After finished our coffee (all of us didn't finish our breakfast set), we ordered 2nd round of tea and dessert. We understand that there is a time limitation imposed if the restaurant was crowded. Apparently the restaurant was abt 2/3 full (it was a weekday, 12pm) and the lead waitress or manager (presumably cos she was the only one wearing floral dress while the rest of the service crew was in black) came to our table. Without a word, she stood besides us with her portable bill machine and started to generate the bill besides us. I find her action rude and uncalled for, in the least she should hv checked with us if we were done with our tea. If we managed to get her name tag correctly, the waitress Gillian blurted out an "obligated" thank you after we sighed the bill. And oh Ya, they do not provide stylus for their bill machine and my girlfriend was told to use her own finger to sign on the "portable machine"! Not worth to spend $165 buck here
1
Restaurant was quite empty but no one attended to us. Had to keep waving to get staffs attention. They got our order wrong twice and didn't even bother to change but insisted that it was the correct one when I have specifically said and pointed out Carribean upon ordering. The staff insisted that it was Canadian. Not wanting to argue more as I was hosting a friend from overseas here, I let the matter rest. Food wasn't that great either and definitely overpriced. Wasn't given a receipt upon payment and we waited for it just to find the staff already attending to a new customer. My first time and it will definitely be the last time ever!

I would recommend it's food fare to anyone who is a hearty-breakfast aficionado. It is my second visit to this restaurant and was deeply disappointed with their service and more so with their justifications of what I had requested. I had asked for very warm water and was told they'd only serve room-temperature water. They did eventually accede to my request after a second request but made it clear to me that they would not be able to do so again. I was perplexed and so asked what I presumed was a more experienced staff. He explained to me that they were not able to cater to my need for warm water and I paraphrase "as our priority is to cater to the needs to all our customers". Aren't I a customer or does my need for warm water not qualify as a need in their definitive service protocol? I left the restaurant with a sinking feeling as I had been gushing to my close friend about this establishment before I brought her there. She too shared my sentiments about the ludicrously flimsy justification of dismissing my need for warm water.
2
Our visit to the restaurant to have brunch was not a pleasant one as the waiter has accidentally spilled the hot chocolate. The mobile phone which was placed near the hot chocolate was not spared. We experienced some minor technical issue while using the mobile phone. It was our first time patronizing and it was quite a letdown. 
3
We have to waive a few times to grab servers' attention for our orders, despite there are many of them around. The main reason, which we could see was, lack of eye-contacts with customers.
1
The service is slow, food quality and taste has seriously gotten from bad to worse. Since it got bought over, the "yum factor" simply doesn't exist. Not returning to either location, although we just moved into the Orchard neighborhood!!
4
Food is nice. Ambience is good. Service is pleasant. Good place for occassional meetups. Price is on the high side though.
5
After rave reviews from friends, I finally got to try it.
What I like about this place:
- nice ambience
- friendly attentive staff
- great food : we finished every single morsel on our plates
- good coffee
I can't wait to return!

Dear Stephanie,We are writing to you as we were told that you are one of he the owners of this restaurant, and with the hope that our experience can be used as a source of improvement ideas.First, we were so excited to go to Wild Honey. I had researched it the night we arrived in Singapore as we were looking for a vegetarian/vegan friendly place. It had great blog entries and the menu and setting looked terrific. The next morning, we held off our hunger until 9am to be amongst the first customers in the Scott's Plaza location. We were ready to order within a few minutes - my FiancÃ© had set her sight on the muesli with berries, and wanted to have it with soy milk instead of yogurt since she does not eat dairy. I wanted the California eggs tofu scramble.Surprise ! When we placed our order, we were told by the waitress that, although they offer soy milk, they can't substitute the Yogurt for it.Really ? Is it pre-made? We asked... Can't really imagine it would be at nearly 20 dollars for a plate... 'no' she replies... But we don't do substitution. But what if we don't eat yogurt ?? Are we force to eat it ? Didn't make sense, so we gave it another try and asked to speak with the floor manager (Min), expecting some sort of apologies and 'of course we will accommodate you' ....like any other restaurant on the planet would have done.Surprise #2 !! The manager proceed to explain us that they 'can't change the presentation of their meal' ... Not allowed. If you are allergic to something beware - they'd rather kill you than modify the presentation of their meal. (we actually asked him what if we had an allergy to an ingredient and he said sorry can't take it out...absurd)So we said 'what can we eat here then that's vegan' ? ... He suggested a green salad. At 9am.We were shocked! We tried one last time...Sir - are you serious ? We are going to leave your restaurant and forgive a 40 dollars meal, pack our stuff and leave with one of the worst restaurant service experience in our life... You really don't want to remove the yogurt in your dish and give us a little pot of soy milk on the side please ? There are 2 other people in the whole restaurant and we really promise we won't tell anyone that you spoiled the presentation of the dish ... His answer: 'Sorry Sir, nothing I can do

I read the very good reviews about this restaurant so was really looking forward to a full english breakfast. Sadly it didn't live up to expectations. The sausage was very pink and looked undercooked, the bacon portion was tiny, and a very small portion of potatoes.The cappuccino however was the nicest I have ever had, so full of flavour instead of a mouthful of froth.I think I would give this restaurant another go as other peoples meals looked very nice
5
We visited Wild Honey Scotts Square this afternoon for brunch. We were warmly welcomed even though we reached much ahead of our reservation time. We ordered the Eggs Benedict which were deliciously creamy, but those who can't eat Pork wouldn't be able to eat it as the eggs are wrapped in ham. They also can't substitute pork sausages for chicken. The Tuscan Sun sandwiches were amazing; lots of good options for vegetarians too. The pancakes with raspberry compote and maple syrup were soft and delicious. The scrambled eggs were flavorful; the herbs they used were very fresh and brought out the flavors of the food so well. Even my 2 year old baby loved the scrambled eggs which she usually doesn't eat at home! The service was excellent. Will surely be back soon with friends
5
Both of the Wild Honey locations are worth a visit. My favourite is the one in Orchard Gallery, though Scotts Square is up there too. Walking in to these cafes gives you a relaxed "at home" vibe. The food is excellent. Large portions, so you could share and leave room for dessert. Juices and coffee are excellent, alcoholic drinks at reasonal prices too. Great atmosphere. A local's secret shared. 
4
Great location esp if you sit in the verandah. Great menu and food and service. We had quite a late meal one evening so we had to order main and dessert together. Main came in cold and the dessert placed under hot lamp which wasn't great so when we complained, the guy in charge replaced the cold main and made a fresh dessert even if the kitchen was technically closed......good recovery and the food was delicious? Good portions at reasonable prices.

Disclaimer: I hate queuing for restaurants out of principle, and when I see a queue outside a restaurant I immediately go somewhere else.But my wife made a booking at Wild Honey, so we went.I previously thought it was for pretentious expats with too much money - and I was right.The fact that the chef refused to make a plain omelette for my son shows either all omelettes are pre-cooked in advance, or we were not worthy to have one made specially.The wait staff were friendly and efficient, and our food arrived quickly. The portions were generous. The food tasted fine.But I still wouldn't queue for this place. There are other places just as good, if less elaborate, such as Maison Kayser or Dome in the basement of the same building. Or try Galbiati Gourmet at Rail Mall in Upper Bukit Timah Road. Great food without the pretense
3
Went to dine here my third time, the food is as good as before. However service could still be improved as customers are not given sufficient attention and staff could smile more.
1
Bad service and attitude of the staffs! Took forever to get our food!
And to had to signed a consent letter for take away our orders was horrendous policy!
1
Had a really disappointing experience at Wild Honey over the weekend. My friend and I put in our order, but an hour later, we were still waiting for our food and none of the servers came to check up on us. When we finally inquired about our order, we found out that it never went into their system. The only excuse we were given was that their system had broken down. We were then asked for our order an additional 2 times, and there must have been a major disconnect between the staff and kitchen, because even after repeating my order twice, it came incorrectly (I had asked for sauce on the side, and the order can with the sauce piled on top). When we asked to speak to the manager, he just came over and said that it must have been a bad day, without offering any other type of compensation. Unfortunately, I will not be able to recommend this restaurant to anyone in the future due to the poor level of customer servies.

Every visit to Singapore we dine at Wild Honey Mandarin Orchard. Because of the queue we visit this Scotts branch instead. Walking in excitement was built because of the large place, our group was big so we need the space. As we entered the place we noticed a disturbing odor, when we asked the waitresses they said it was the flowers. We noticed that it was probably they did not change the water. During the order, the waitress was not very knowledgeable of the menu, even gave us the wrong information. When the food came and it was not the right description by the waitress, we asked to replace it and the waitress easily said: we couldn't do that, sorry. Our advice: visit the Mandarin Orchard branch, the queue is worth the wait.

Wild Honey serves an extensive variety of all day breakfast dishes from all around the world. A very nice concept indeed. We ordered Tunisian breakfast set meal that came with a sizzling (not so sizzling) pan of shakshouka and three brioche bread slices. The shakshouka was tad runny and it was almost room temperature. Definitely not the best way to have it. We also ordered Scandinavian breakfast set meal which came with salmon fillet on a bed of crispy potato rosti, char grilled asparagus, cherry tomatoes and homemade hollandaise sauce. The salmon was well-cooked. For desserts, we ordered brownie with ice cream. Brownie was warm and moist. For drinks, we ordered dark chocolate latte and chai latte. The drinks were impressive too. Overall, it was a nice experience. Quality food, nice ambience and reasonably priced food.

Came for brunch with a family of 4 yesterday. However there are some negative points and kind suggestions i would like to share. As for the menu, we understand that there can't be any major modifications done to it. But aren't we even allowed to request for the consistency of our meat(Well Done/Rare etc etc). We were told that our request can't be looked into. I believe we didn't request for difficult changes to the menu such as replacing the pork sausages to chicken, or fusionising two different dishes to one etc etc. All we request for was for a "Well Done" crispy bacon instead of the normal ones. What if i do not like the current choice of bacon, do i still have to accept it and dine with Wild Honey? On weekends, we have to be patient with the staffs to take order due to overwhelming orders. So we waited before placing our orders with one of the staffs when she was available(do take note, our hot drinks were only served to us when we were about to finish with the food). I decided to make payment first before finishing off my drink. But what happen next really suprises me, we were told to hurry up and leave so that the next in line of patrons could use the table. Is it our fault for having our hot drinks served late? So if payment is made, am i right to say that our time with Wild Honey is over? Please look into this matters as i believe doing so will improve the satisfaction level of patrons dining at the restaurant. A brilliant concept of breakfast all day and the food is good, but if the customer service area can be improved on certain areas, it would be a much better place to dine in.

If you have any food requirements or pregnant - GO ANYWHERE ELSE!The majority of the overpriced food is pre-made. God forbid I ask for lemon on my salad instead of anchovy dressing. "Cannot".I have terrible food allergies - anaphylaxis, which can be fatal and far from a "milk upsets my stomach". Can I please have a single egg? "No ma'am'', we do not sell a single egg. You will need to purchase an entire meal to be served an egg."I ended up paying $40 for a bowl of spinach leaves, a side of bacon and an egg my girlfriend gave me from her meal.I'm so appalled that a restaurant that is so well known and received has such backward customer service.On top of this, they mixed up my pregnant girlfriend's order and let her wait an additional 30mins for her meal to be re-made while everyone else was eating.So disappointed

I was looking forward to eating at Wild Honey again, considering I've had amazing experiences here before. They didn't have a dish that I wanted off the menu and I believe it isn't going to be available for a while. Considering the menu is relatively newly designed, why have the dish in there in the first place.So, a colleague and I ordered to share. We ordered the Santa Fe off the Vegetarian section and the Brittany, and the Wild Mocha and Hazelnut Latte. The Santa Fe came with some Breakfast Potatoes (that wasn't mentioned on the menu, it had been removed as compared to the previous times). These potatoes are made in duck fat, obviously making it unsuitable for vegetarians. Again, why include it in the Vegetarian section if it's not. The waiter did take it back to remove the potatoes. This did dampen the experience a fair bit. The dish in itself wasn't particularly well made that day to boot. The Brittany wasn't bad - Bananas, Mascarpone, & Caramel is a combination that can barely go wrong. The coffees were really good.Another thing that day that was irksome was the cutlery hygiene. A glass had white marks in the inside and the two water glasses we were given stank of raw eggs. I've had only good experiences here before, but this was a huge let down and I may not go back for a really long time
5
Great breakfast with an amazing choice. I had the Caribbean, waffles, creme patisserie, banana mango raspberries, passion ruin sauce,so good. Too many waffles for accompaniments,but I didn't need them. My husband had a choice of breads ( delicious) with preserves, portions not in keeping had to ask for more butter and cherry jam, the cherry jam was so good. Same with tea, came in little pots, enough for one cup only, had to ask for a top up. Both request were received with a willingness to help and no extra charge, the restaurant was full and buzzing. although if we hadn't done our research, wouldn't have known it existed, tucked away on the third floor of Scotts Squar
4
all day breakfast main course on the slightly higher price as compared to some other restaurants but portion was good so that makes up for it. tried the "England' and love the mushroom and toast bread! very cosy dining environment and service was quick. average price per person $30 without drinks
4
Nice ambience, pretty good food and excellent client service. Wish I had known Chop e app earlier too, a breeze for instant reservation and reminder service.
4
Scones are yummy but my partner's steak came out medium well instead of medium rare. Wait staff should be more attentive to customer's requirement.
4
Service needs improving at times but the food is always delicious but the bacon served on the full Englush was not great and the coffee portions are much too small.
4
Need to book if weekend or you need to wait minimal 1 hour before get table.Try wild mocca dolce, contains: espresso, moccha, milk & honey. And when you 'slrups' from the edge of glass, then each taste of contents come together in your mouth, amazing!Very nice place & breakfast, eventhough a bit of much portion & expensive price

Hi,We were given a small table of 5 people. A squeezy and uncomfortable setting for colleagues to be brushing shoulders with. One of our colleagues had to grab a stool to sit at the edge of the low table. He had to arch his back through lunch.I noticed that there was a long dining table which could sit a fairly number of people. However, the people who were given to sit at that table were 3 or 4 different sets of couples, leaving an empty chair between each couple.I have no idea who assigned those seats. But that person needs to go for some serious training.
3
Food is good but it's weird that they insist serve room temperate water. Makes people think dat they can only get u tap water. So obviously there is no warm or cold water service. Just a nice glass bottle to fill in the tap water for u. Nonetheless, food is good but pricey
4
We tried the two sandwiches- Cuban & roasted veggie. Both were really good! Would have liked the veggie one even more without all the butter. Order the spicy citrus juice which was nice and gingery. Wrapped up with an amazing dark chocolate Orange chiffon cake. Will go back
5
I really enjoyed my early morning meal at Wild Honey. Not only were the staff pleasant and cheerful, the food was of good quality, tasty and served in a timely manner. The ambience is pretty fantastic. Must try: the portobello road - the mushrooms were divine
4
Wild Honey has a fantastic brunch menu. A wide and fresh range of great food and drink. You pay extensively for it but it's worth it. Nice atmosphere within the venue as well which never feels too crowded. Make sure you book (especially on a weekend) - it's a popular place in Singapore
5
I love how their brunch menu actually have quite a wide range of meats, fishes and different staples to go along with it. Though it might take quite awhile for the food to come but the ambience is extremely enjoyable and pretty. The service is good and the staffs are very alert as well. Definitely one of my fave brunch places in town! And speaking of town, the price range is more on a pricer end. So be prepared to spend about 35SGD per pax for a simple main course and a non-alcoholic drink
5
I like the food especially English breakfast ,guys can try it.
Good environment ,can go with friends,family,couple and solo.
4
Went there yesterday night for Christmas eve dinner. Nice environment.
Food is good, nice and simple.
4
Great breakfast selection and well presented. My only comment would be that they should consider having some gluten free bread in the freezer that they cold toast since much of the menu involves bread in some form of another.
4
Food and environment is great. Staff could be more welcoming at least carving more smile on the face because they all seem like they are working in stress and no eye contact with customers especially a few young guys.
5
This is my second visit to Wild Honey. I have been to the one at Mandarin Gallery but it is rather difficult to get a table there, even for just one person! The one at Scotts Square is much better. I love the variety of the food but I wish there had been more options of tea for me to choose from (I love tea!). The servings are generous. The poached egg on my Boulevard St Michel is beautifully done. The service is fantastic. We were running late and had to push back our reservation by 30mins which the restaurant has kindly accommodated.
5
No matter if we go for a quick bite orChristmas Day brunch, Wild Honey never fails us. The good always meets our expectations and the few times there are service hiccups the management always corrects the situation to create the perfect experience for us so we continue to come back. Oh, and best French hot chocolate and scones ever
4
Scott square is right next to the grand hyatt and Mariott hotels and across the road from the royal plaza on Scotts So if you are staying in any of these hotels, wild honey is not far away.The breakfasts are good and you get a variety of selections from different countries. Normal times, you can have breakfast too...but why would you want that when there is a whole selection of dishes on the menu.Give it a tr

I've been to this place three times before and I loved the cosy feeling this place provides, making conversation flow effortlessly. My advice to would be patrons though is to make a reservation prior to going over as it does get crowded. The all-day brunch option is pretty decent and I loved the portion size of my Scandinavian meal. The salmon was cooked perfectly although I thought that the rosti was a little burnt. The coffee here is also pretty good. Service was quick and proper although I wished the service staff were friendlier to the customers. The only thing I thought would definitely need an improvement is the chair upholstery fabric. I'd been allocated the couple armchair-like seats all the times I've been there and I've notices the same stains on them on all three occasions. In fact, I thought there were more stains on the chairs the last time I was there, on 18 Dec 2014

Had lunch yesterday with a friend who relies on tripadvisor regularly for reviews of restaurants and hotels. He mentioned that Wild Honey does not have good reviews on tripadvisor, so I was curious how it would turn out. My previous experiences have been okay. As it turned out, it was somewhat difficult to get the wait staff's attention. We must have chatted for 20 minutes before we finally waved down a server. When our drinks came, a hot chocolate was served instead of the latte I ordered. The server instead of apologizing and take the wrong drink away immediately, she said she would check. I didn't think much of it at the time, but my friend who is more into customer services pointed out that the server should have taken the drink away instead of "checking if the order was placed correctly"? In general most of the wait staff did seem inexperienced. Guess the premium one pays for the prices goes into the high rental for the location instead of staff training or salary?

Wild Honey has always been my favorite spot to enjoy quality all-day breakfast / brunch, in cosy poshy settings. Hence, for tonight's Christmas get-together dinner with the dear *J and *L, we selected this place as The VenueThe outlet at Scotts Square is newer, set in dim, intimate lightings with a blend of vintage-modernistic furnishings to give it a plush but homely feel. The balcony alfreco dining area looked inviting as well, but that evening's searing weather gave us pause to venture. We stayed indoors in the cool comfort of couches, electrical lights made to resemble candlelights and soft music in the background - the perfect catching-up place as well.*L had the Spanish Hash Breakfast (SGD$24.00) with diced chorizo, corned beef, potato cubes, grilled ciabatta, poached eggs and Hollandaisesauce. The house corned beef was succulent andflavorful, and the complement by potato dices made the dish immediately wholesome in a homecooked manner. Paired with the crispy ciabatta, this was another great choice.As for me, I had the Scandinavian breakfast again (SGD$28.00), consisting of asparagus, crispy potato rosti, grilled salmon and homemade Hollandaise sauce, with the sweetest cherry tomatoes. This is almost my signature dish everytime I eat at Wild Honey - the tender salmon paired with appetite whetting crispy potato and asparagus are all my favorite things.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-wild-honey-scotts-square.htm

service was good and attentive. atmosphere was nice and relaxing
restaurant wasn't noisy. food was filling and worth the price. enjoyed my brunch and time there
4
I like going to Wild Honey for brunch but it is almost impossible to get a table. If you're lucky to find one, then you will be treated to a wide variety of egg dishes from around the world
4
Been to Wild Honey for at least 5 times in the past and our latest visit proof one thing, the wonderful experience still stay . Great food, reasonable price, cozy atmosphere and wonderful staff. Truly enjoyed our dining experience there. Will definitely visit again soon.
5
Once again we had wonderful meals. The menu is extensive and the parmesan crusted poached egg of the St Michel breakfast was perfectly cooked for me - firm white and runny yolk. Good coffee too - as you get in Australia.
4
I like Wild Honey at Scotts. The food is good, coffee is nice, and the service attendants are well-mannered and service prompt. One little thing is that the restaurant tends to get a little noisy at times, and the music volume needs to be reduced at these times so that we don't need to raise our voice to talk to each other...Otherwise, I like this place and will surely go back for my weekend brunch with my friends...
5
As usual, the service was amazing! My friend is over from the UK and whenever I have visitors I bring them to Wild Honey. Not only is the food amazing, huge tasty portions, but the atmosphere is a mixture of chilled out, eclectic taste, ladies who lunch to flip flops and coffee in the corner. A brilliant place which is a must to visit. My perfect brunch place :

Had most of the all-day breakfast on the menu before, all good, highly recommend European, Aussie and Tunisian. Service is good as usual, attentive staff who are well-groomed, well-mannered and well-educated. Good experience overall, but prices went up again from the last time we came. Ah well! As such, will certainly come back again but not a place to be frequented.
3
Hot breakfast on cold plate equals cold foodStaff not very attentive. Had to request order to be taken and correct cutlery to be placed on table. One of our meals came out 5 minutes after the first three, and we had to ask where it was!Shame we had an ordinary experience because we were looking forward to a nice breakfast. Not worth paying the price we did.
3
The atmosphere was good, the place is lovely. The food was strictly ok! A little pricey for that food. Not a very extensive menu. Also we had very little time to finish our food. Whilst we were eating our food, we were asked to leave as the time allocated for our table was over. We even requested extension well in advance, but this was rejected. In the end, we had to rush to eat our food and we did not have time to even order n eat desserts! Weekend brunch should be relaxed and not hurried up like the one we experienced yesterday. A nice place, but we are not likely to visit this place again

We loved this place so much on our first visit that we returned again for breakfast two days later! It was such a treat to find this place. The interior is quirky and interesting and feels very inviting. The first visit we ate at the large communal table near the kitchen, as they were very busy, which made for some nice small talk with our dining neighbours. The next time we were sat at a small table for two closer to the window.The menu was a welcome range of western-style breakfast dishes. The hardest part was trying to decide what to have, it all looked so delicious! Both on the menu and in front of the people seated near us. The upside to sitting near the kitchen on the first visit was being able to eyeball the dishes as they went past to other tables.The shakshuka was a real standout for me. Perfectly cooked eggs (I like them a bit runny) and a good balance of flavour in the tomato sauce. The brioche bread complemented the heartiness of the dish perfectly and was just right for mopping up the last bits of the dish.Will definitely be back next time I'm in Singapore

Our 1st visit there and I liked it. Food was good and so was their customer service. Portion of food was quite big. We ordered 5 main courses and shared among 7 of us and all were filled.
4
Good service but food not as tasty as previous visit.. a bit disappointed.. Overall still worth to visit..
5
Lovely place and attentive staff... Tried the sweet breakie option for the first time and loved it.... The French toast with banana and caramel is yum....
5
great food, pleasant surroundings. Good place for meetings, lots of posh ladies who lunch (breakfast)...well worth a visit if you can. It's very quiet and large, so perfect for a quiet chat/catch up. The muesli is like eating horse oats, that's my only caveat.
5
An awesome experience for bruch at Wild Honey Scotts. Ambience is pleasant, good place for a sumptuous brunch. Portion served is huge and valued for its price. Certainly visiting WH again!

This restaurant works really well for an all day breakfast place. It is not your average diner that you find in the US, but a really gourmet one with worldclass menu. This place is not five-star fine dining. But if you want to have your load of eggs and fries, you cant go wrong her

I've been to Wild Honey 6 or 7 times since it opened a few years ago, and while the menu still offers inventive, delicious-sounding dishes, I'm afraid the quality as well as service seems to be declining. My family and I went there for brunch on Sunday, Nov 23rd, and the food was not served hot, the wait staff were harried and abrupt, and they took forever to serve us or bring us cutlery (we had to ask for knives 3 times), and to top it off, the pastry under my eggs was so hard I had to saw at it with my knife; frankly, it had the texture of bread that has been microwaved and when cooled, of course it becomes hard. I don't know what's happening with the management or the kitchen operations, but as someone who loves the offering of all-day breakfast, I'm looking for another place to indulge. I'm sorry, Wild Honey. I want to love this place, but I can't

We have a party of 4 including my 5 yr old who is on a strict diet. I informed them upon arrival out of courtesy that we have prepared our own food for him. Though it is a policy that they do not allow outside food but I t was very nice of them to make it an exception. I ordered English all day breakfast which is a huge portion that comes with sausage, scrambled eggs, bacon, 2 thick slices of brioche toast, mushrooms and baked beans. Honestly, I think it is good to share with someone in order to try their dessert. My girlfriends had Spanish and New York and they are both happy with them. We have been there a few times and in fact, we know what we want. We had red velvet for dessert. It's not too sweet and coated with chocolate fudge. The sponge are moist and we enjoy it. The only thing we are not happy is the Americano. It has a sour after taste and the cup is pretty small. The bill turned out to be about $140 with 3 mains, 5 drinks and a dessert, pretty reasonable. It was not too crowded on a weekday lunch hours and staffs are very attentive to clear dishes and ask for needs.
5
This was my 2nd visit to Wild Honey in Singapore and it was awesome as this time there was no long queue despite being Sunday afternoon, I had to sit on the bar counter last round due to limited tables as the crowd was overwhelming.I ordered "The English" this time which is a full complete english breakfast dish. It was extremely huge and I really had difficulty finishing it despite it being very delicious. It is recommended to share this dish with another person unless you are a big eater.Their menu do not have any photos but do feel free to ask the lovely waiters/waitresses there for recommendation if they are not too busy. I also loved their Nature's Remedy drink which was basically hot honey with a cinnamon stick which pairs well with a heavy meal. Their prices are above average but with their large portions it is quite worthwhile. Highly recommended. Do be patient when visiting as the restaurant tend to be really busy when it is extremely crowded
3
The food was ok. I ordered the steak sandwich but I got more bread and mushrooms than actual meat. Additionally, the food was not served hot. It was luke warm by the time it reached our table. The services was terrible. I had to raise my hand to get any type of service as if I was in elementary school.
4
Atmosphere has been great! The food is tasty.. We had English, Norwegian & another salmon dish. We also had freshly made juices and mocha. It has been tasty but toooo pricey
4
Nice ambiance! I ordered English for lunch & it's worth the money. The portion is not only huge but taste wonderful.
4
Diverse menu that would appeal to many, with menu items that have the feel of countries from around the world, and really do make you feel like home. This was pertinent for us having been travelling for 8 weeks. Great espresso coffee. Our first visit was outstanding however on our return visit, the menu had changed and think there was some hiccups in the kitchen with the newer menu items. One meal was not as hot as it should have been, however this was quickly remedied by staff, with a fresh meal provided. Service is high quality and friendly. Location is above street level and whilst it is air-conditioned throughout, the open air verandah is a welcome change if you want to choose to dine in a space without the air on. Decor is trendy and comfortable yet homely
4
I have been to Wild Honey a few times now and I really enjoy the food, decor and atmosphere. However, on my most recent visit I was informed that they were not serving any cold drinks - at all. I was quite confused and disappointed by this. Even more so due to the fact that other people who arrived before and after us were drinking cold drinks
3
We went to the Scotts Square branch recently - a large group of friends for brunch - table pre booked for about 12-14.The food was decent / good - I had the 'tunisian' which is similar to 'Huevos Rancheros' - a tomato and chorizo / onion base with a couple of eggs on top with some bread on the side. $22++ so nearly $26 all in. (not great value - portion was not that large )Other people had various breakfast - the food was generally good - but a bit pricy for what you get .. 1 hot breakfast plate, coffee and juice would come to around $45 all in. The latte was very small - about 1/2 size of Starbucks or Costa - for more $.The service was OK - took drinks orders , then food and had jugs of water on the table.We were only allowed to stay at the table for a set time before the next booking came in - as this place is quite popular.Overall - we enjoyed it , good company, decent food and a nice ambience - HOWEVER .. did come away thinking .. going to a good 4 to 5 star Hotel ( Conrad, Shangri La etc. ) for their breakfast or brunch buffets is probably a lot better value ( or go the other way to the local Kopi shop for eggs n Prata) - much more on offer at a big Hotel and can eat more leisurely for a similar price - a lot of Hotel buffets seem to be around $45-$50+ ..and you can get your waffles eggs and omelettes made to order with ample coffee , juice , meat etc etc
4
Great ambience and generous portion of food. We ordered an English brunch set, a European brunch set and a Canadian pancake set. The first 2 sets are great. We enjoyed them very much. But the Canadian set came with 3 huge & thick pancakes. I'll suggest to cut it down to 2 & add a small portion of side, eg. Baked potatoes or roasted mushroom
3
A fantastic place with fantastic decor and on the whole great service. Seated, ordered and food came really quickly. Food was the downside of our visit today as tasted rather bland which was a shame. The constant dripping of the air conditioning unit into my food throughout was also a little irritating
5
The menu is extensive and this was my 3rd visit to Wild Honey. Each time I have chosen a different dish and each time I am delighted! The meals aren't cheap by Singapore standards, nor is the coffee but for a special occasion or romantic get together, this is the place. When you convert it back to local currency, it seems a lot more reasonable. The service is friendly and non-invasive and the decor is beautiful. Air conditioned inside. Bookings recommended on weekends and special days. Can be done online. No chai lattes yet but hopefully soon. The pots of tea go a long way. Fresh tasty and delicious food. The brioche is a must!!
3
It is a yearly affair for us and we visit at least once a year for the last 4 years. And very sad to say that it went from really good, average, bad and worst....Service no longer felt that same and quality of food no longer taste as good. The famous eggs and bread no longer being cooked with passion
1
I have been to Wild Honey at the Mandarin Gallery and enjoyed the experience so I expected the experience to be replicated at the experience to be replicated at the Scotts Square branch but boy was I wrong. The menu seemed a little different from the last time I visited Wild Honey at Mandarin Gallery and they didn't havethe breakfast I wanted. The greatest bugbear I felt was the 90 minutes to eat. The service staff were constantly trying to clear my plate even though I was only halfway through my meal. It felt like a constant reminder for me and a friend to leave the table. When we asked for the bill, it never came and we eventually had to settle the bill at the counter. Overall, disappointing experience at Wild Honey Scotts Square.
4
Absolutely awesome all day breakfast. Highly recommend this place if you r game for breakfast but suggest to make reservations (learnt from experience). Also, don't expect service if busy or crowded. Otherwise, overall I would rate excellent food and service.
5
Looking for breakfast in this part of Singapore? Then Wild Honey is the place to go.
Great ambiance, wide international menu and, best of all, good value prices.
3
I've been here several times and the food has always been excellent. The past two visits have been a bit disappointing. Last time they left the salsa off my dish and yesterday my French toast was almost cold. I Also think the service is going down hill which is a real shame because I want to love this place again
3
Visited the restaurant on the weekend. Place was crowded as expected so reservation is a must. Decor is chic but interior looks cramp as they try to squeeze as much tables as possible into limited space. Food is a bit pricey but well presented perfectly portioned.Unfortunately, they try to squeeze five of us into a table meant for four despite us making reservation prior to visit. So, good food, good table setting, but feels like I'm sitting in a busy foodcourt

I am a big fan of Wild Honey @ Scotts and I go there all the time to visit them. However on that day, I received the worst service I've ever gotten from the restaurant. I had make a booking for 2 tables of 4 on that day as I was going to introduce my friends to the restaurant, they were so excited to go there as I've been raving about it. I was slightly late so I gave my friends the names and booking codes that I've done for them. However when I reached, the server lied to my friend saying that we had 1 table instead of 2 when she told her 2 booking codes. My friend being new, was totally confounded and was left waiting outside for at least 15mins not knowing what to do as the server just went to other customers instead of explaining the situation to her. When I arrived 15mins later and approach the counter, the same server told me a different story. In the end, we had to wait another 15mins before we were seated and we were seated differently from what I had requested before (near each other). There was another free table then so I requested again to be closer but they said someone had specifically requested for that table that was nearer to us (the amount of seated individuals were the same). However, when I went to ask out of curiosity and because I knew (from various bookings) that usually specific tables are not requested.........the customers there did not specifically ask for that table. Therefore I am really upset that the server actually lied twice to us in the whole service. The food was still good, but rather rushed and tasted less stellar than before (it might have been the ruined mood though). But what is the saddest thing is that my friends were severely disappointed by their first experience there

It seems, Wild Honey has this concept of being located in the most "up-class" malls in Singapore, nestled among the shops that, the common people will rarely patronize. Our first visit to the second outlet here at Scotts Plaza, I had to re-check the web for the level on which the outlet is on. 3rd level, corner. Walking into Scotts Plaza, somehow gives me a good vibe. Though, seriously, I would almost never (at least now and before) be found shopping in the shops here. The price tags, just any random one, are almost like the figures I see on my monthly paycheck!Anyhow, back to Wild Honey. I had made a reservation for 7.15pm but arrived about 30 mins earlier. Well, going by the crowd in the restaurant, there did not seem to be a need for reservations? Unless you are visiting in a big group, or say 5 or more? Upon arrival and informing about my prior reservations, I was brought to a 2-seater sofa seat. Service by the manager in-charge was pretty good. One thing I don't really fancy about such dining outlets is, the ultra dim-lighting. Looks really romantic but, hey... not so awesome for photo-taking, be it of humans or of the food. The place can also get increasingly cold with time. First thing I noticed with the menu was, the different food variety offered at the Scotts Plaza outlet. Is this something, new? Or unique to Scotts Plaza?Here they have sandwiches and selected western meals.. think "chicken chop"... without the fries. Service was prompt but the food took some time to arrive. Maybe because there was suddenly a mass order for the kitchen...The music that was playing overhead initially disturbed me much, whilst I was waiting for the friend to arrive. Thankfully, I soon overcome the noise. Unlike some other restaurants we have visited, there seems to be a policy of "i can remove ___ but i won't replace it with something else". The friend had asked if they could replace the bacon with sausages. That's fine I guess. Every restaurant has its own choice of policy.Overall, it was a good dining experience. Prices of the food here are not low, fine for the occasional indulgence.

Food is good, we all like it. Especially the Norwegian breakfast, which has a layer of apocaldo on top the bread and with smoked salmon around the egg on the top of the apocaldo, it was delicious. Make me so happy at the start of a day.
4
Overall it is a nice place with good food & atmosphere. However it can get a bit crowded as it is always full during the weekend & reservation is a must in order to secure a place, if you don't fancy waiting for at least 45mins or more.A little pricey but given the location, it is not surprising. Will probably go there again but for less hassle restaurant of similar food category & quality, I would go for P.S. CafÃ©
5
We went for a weekend dinner and tried four different breakfasts - 3 savory and 1 sweet. All of them were very good particularly the Boulevard St Michel. The service was quick and friendly and we were done in about an hour without being rushed. There was so much variety, we expect to go back again and try the other breakfasts.
4
Visited this restaurant at scotts square to celebrate friend's birthday. Book a table through Chope to avoid disappointment. Service is good but lack of staffs to serve the customers. Food is great with fairly decent price. Decoration is look good around the restaurant. Easy to access to this restaurant via public transport.
2
Female Greeter is not friendly and no smile at all. I couldn't catch her words and when I asked back, I was ignored. One male staff is very helpful. I feel young staff has no experience. Food is good but expensive. Hope service will recover.
4
Great place. Slightly overpriced. Not sure why people feel the need to queue and clutter the place up.
5
we were hosting some overseas guest who wanted a place for brunch. we thought of wild honey! freshly squeezed juice, homemade marmalades and out of this world french toast.
4
The food was good. The drinks was fantastic..
Great atmosphere just that noise level a little on the high side :)
4
Always a pleasure to dine here!
The food is absolutely delicious and has some of the best all day breakfasts anywhere. The service is also prompt and friendly. Overall good location for a quiet brunch
5
My girlfriend and I visited this place the other day--a Thursday at 11:30am and we had to wait for 30 minutes!! You know you are at a great place when that happens. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, decor and feel. Not to mention the food was excellent. Wild Honey was conveniently located right near our hotel (Marriott) but I have a hard time understanding how there are 400 better restaurants in Singapore. We ate B, L and D in SIN for 5 days and this was the only one we talked about possibly eating at again. I am back here on business in December and will make sure one of my meals is here
4
All day breakfast placed, with a variety of different foods from western countries - Great food (at fairly decent prices), slow and very lacking service and extremely busy. Try and get a reservation for here before going. I was able to get a seat straight away as I was dining solo, however just before me a couple were told to wait 15-20 minutes.I rated very good based on the food, however the service did really bring it down
1
I have been to Wild Honey many times and loved it every time - however the latest time was a disaster. I tried to send a complaint to Wild Honey directly - but no response was received.This is what we received for a $103 brunch (3 people):1. Stone cold breakfasts for all2. Coffees that arrived after our cold breakfast (that were ordered before breakfast)3. Ignored by waitress after we said our breakfasts were col
5
This is the first time I have dined in this restaurant. I booked for a table through Chope and the staff is able to prepare our table for us within 5-10 minutes after we have reached there. I actually expected that we can go inside immediately upon arrival but it is not a big deal since we're not in a hurry. The staff that welcomed us and verified our reservation is friendly and assured to us that our table was being prepared.Overall, the service is very good. The decor also suits the style and the cuisine of the restaurant. However, it is too noisy as there are many people dining there. In terms of food, it manages to meet my expectation. We have ordered, for examples, English and European, and they taste great. The portion is large too. The only thing that I was dissatisfied is the size of the brioche in English was a bit too large
2
The initial excitement of having breakfast for dinner died at the first glance of the menu. Limited variety & pricey. Thinking that what we ordered should have some "wow" factor, it didn't. The English breakfast that costs 25 bucks consist of scrambled egg, 2 thick toasts, 1 very salty sausage & 2 very salty bacon as well as baked beans which I would prefer the canned version anytime. Service is so-so as they were short handed. We had to call for different servers to refill our water & the bill
4
I had a very pleasant time re-meeting my friend of many years. The service was very friendly and pleasant. This way of booking was great, and I very much enjoyed the reservation confirmation.
4
The staff is proactive and took their effort to explain their signature dishes and propose recommendations to their customers.
1
So many people praised about this place so we gave a go. No complaint even we had to wait for 30 min. The question is the service - impolite. Food quality is like fast food. Really? I think Singapore can do better.
4
It was a great place for catching up with friends.. great for couple dating too.. I tried the tunisan and it was great! However, they do have lots of reservation on the weekend so you can't hang around to chat for too long..
5
I have visited Wild Honey many times and rate this as one of the best places in Singapore to have a Western style breakfast. Food is delicious, fresh and consistent. Try the 'Canadian' if you are a fan of pancakes or 'portobello road' for yummy poached eggs and mushrooms. Will be back again soon
5
This is a wonderful little place. It's in a fairly exclusive mall on Scoots Road in downtown Singapore.Serving Western all day breakfasts, including full English, beautiful omelettes, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and bagels.The food is beautifully presented, the service is impeccable and the ambience lovely.You need to book as it's always busy, whatever time of day.You won't regret eating here as it's great food at very reasonable (for Singapore) prices

We fancied brunch and had heard rave reviews from colleagues about this place and after checking the menus on the interweb thingy we decided to favour the Scotts Rd establishment with our custom.We had reservation so they put us into the queuing system, having asked if "bar seats" were OK - they were, we said. After a short wait we were called to the "bar seats", a small shelf around the central pillar. I was not impressed but (a) I was hungry, having been on the sauce Friday night and (b) could see the place was full.So we perched on our seats and menued.I ordered a full English and some granola to start, along with a mixed juice and tea, while the good lady opted for Norwegian, eggs Benedict but with salmon.The granola arrived first, a huge pot of granola and a smear of yoghurt. The granola was fine, but just too much. As I started, my wife's eggs arrived, they looked OK, but as with my first course, sat on a huge plate and I could see what was coming.I got about a third of the way through mine before the yoghurt ran out and I was crunching dry grains and then my new plateful arrived - where to put everything? We juggled pots and cups and plates around, slipped the waiter my rejected granola and started on the full English. With brioche? I don't understand that one. The mushrooms were dry, not enough oil in the cooking perhaps. The bacon was pretty decent, so thumbs up for that. My Cumberland sausage was not a Cumberland sausage - why is it so hard to get good bangers in Asia?? But the main "??" is reserved for the so-called baked beans. Tasteless white beans of some sort in a flavourless red liquid which may have been intended to pass for tomato sauce.We ploughed through - the eggs Norwegian were pronounced OK and if there were to be a next time, I might try them, but at >$100 for two, I doubt there will be a next time. Although the place is popular, I am not sure it will survive: it will be overtaken by the next place as is so often the case here

I visited this morning with my father and his girlfriend. The food is excellent, but the service is quite poor. My wife was ill and had to stay in bed back in the hotel, so I was hoping to bring back some breakfast for her. After a delicious meal we called the waitress over and asked for an egg sandwich to take away. She refused.I was confused and rather taken aback, so I repeated my request. She replied with "Sorry sir, no egg for takeaway." In other words, she was willing to sell me something without egg in it, but no egg dishes (even an egg sandwich, the QUINTESSENTIAL takeout food). I pressed her as to why, and she explained to me that eggs spoil easily. What a startling revelation, I can't believe I failed to notice the rapid spoilage rate of poultry ovum in my first 38 years!I gestured out the window to my hotel directly across the street and said I was pretty certain the eggs wouldn't spoil in my 2 minute and 30 second walk over to air conditioned lobby, or in the ensuing ninety second journey up to my room. Unfortunately, logic is not something you find a lot of in Singapore. She flatly refused to bring me an egg sandwich to go.I paid, left, walked across the street to the Starbucks, and purchased an egg sandwich. Shockingly, it didn't spoil

I have been several times with friends and alone with my spouse. I have always had a fantastic breakfast/brunch at Wild Honey. The owners have done a great job of finding an untapped niche in Singapore. There are very few places in Singapore where the staff has been trained in "real" customer service. It is pleasant to eat there not only for the fantastic, fresh and creative dishes but because the servers do a great job of taking care of you. It's so delicious, it's advisable to make reservations for weekend breakfast/brunch. It can takes weeks to get a table for a weekend. My only complaint is the acoustics are a bit loud. When the restaurant is crowded it can be heard to hear. I will continue to go back for a proper breakfast that reminds me of home
4
The food is excellent, however, as seems to be common at many Singapore restaurants, the serving staff seems very afraid of taking charge to fix things that have gone wrong. The kitchen had missed my wife's order completely and it was only after running back and forth a few times they admitted to this. That meant she got her food when my daughter and I were all finished wich kind of ruined the experience a bit as we were there to eat together of course. Two things with this we didn't really like, 1) Walking past our table several times teh waitress could clearly see one of us was missing food 2) When the mistake was admitted by the staff, no compensation at all was offered, not even to pay for the coffee! Here a true service minded staff would have realized that a good gesture was needed to keep customers happy, but no, they were happy to provide the full bill, making sure everything was accounted for. Great great food, but the service left a bitter after taste, especially when things didn't go according to plan. Work on that, and this is a great place to eat
4
Nice and relaxing place for Sunday brunch. They have a big menu so am sure there's something for everyone and everything is good!! Only thing is you should definitely book in advance as it's very busy on Sunday!!
4
Love this place. Worth the wait. Sometimes service is a little hit and miss, but not today - great service, perfect poached eggs and thoughtfully plated work coming out of the kitchen.
Well done, guys! Keep it going. We'll always be back

Your Review
Very satisfying. Actually I've been to wild honey at scotts n mandarin gallery many times. Bookings were made by my girl or phone. I have always been pleased with the food and service. I just hope the coffee served is hotter.
4
I have been there once with my friend came from Japan.We ordered Red velvet cake but waiter said its runout already.So we change to Orange Chiffon cake instead with long black.The chiffon cake was the best of my whole life! Sadly, long black was awful as quite sour.So if they improve it or you just order cake and tea is probably good choice.Because I really liked the atmosphere they had, I'll visit again

1. The reservation system that they used was user-friendly. I made a reservation for 5 person just 1 hour before. One will be able to choose the available timing on the system. About half an hour before the reservation time, there will be an automated voice call to confirm your reservation which I think is very nice for the customers as well as the restaurant. 2. In terms of customer service, the staffs were prompt and attentive to requests/response. Not to mention that they were friendly too. :)3. Among the 5 of us, we ordered 4 dishes. We could each have a taste of the different dishes of what Wild Honey offers. The ingredients used were fresh. Not much complain about the food though. But I realised that the menu is a little bit different from the Mandarin Gallery outlet? Prices are still reasonable. Personally, i think what's best will be the ambiance. It is cosy, not too loud and spacious. It is a nice place to have a chill out session with friends or a nice brunch with your partner. I would recommend this place to those who have not been there yet. :)Cheers!

I totally recommend people to the restuarant. I have been booking on Chope for Wildhoney every time I have a meet up with my friends. The atmosphere is awesome, and service was pretty good. One thing I must comment is their food. For the last two visit I went over to wildhoney the standard really have dropped. I was dissapointed.
4
I went for lunch and had eggs Benedict, orange juice and espresso. Food quality is absolutely outstanding even though I honestly don't think this was the original recipe for eggs Benedict. The souce used for the eggs was very tasty. Orange juice is real orange and espresso is as near to the italian model as it can be.Highly suggested even though the price is quite high at 24â‚¬ but quality justifies it.Quantity of food is ok. Service very nice and quick
4
Hey guys! Just wanna let you guys know that you guys did an amazing service and also, you guys are way friendly! That's the way singapore f&b industry. I myself work in a restaurant and I was impressed by the quality of service you guys gave. Good job! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
4
The atmosphere was very nice. Cozy with country style feel. I like their best. Very nice and I will definitely go again
3
Service was great and food was served really fast. However, taste wise, it was just average. Nothing much to shout about and it was pretty expensive. The restaurant however was decorated very nicely and it exudes a good warm and relaxed ambiance.
5
We enjoyed the food very much!
Good services provided.
Good recommendation provided when we are not too sure what to order.
5
Good foods, warm welcome.
Atmosphere is good and i will go back there again😊.
Will recommend my familes and friends to go.

My partner and I enjoyed our meal. The serving was generous and the staff constantly checks that we're okay.
3
Convenient location across from Royal Plaza on Scotts where I was staying. It is sandwich heaven so after perusing the menu and deciding what would best suit a head cold I chose the Hangover. If you have a craving for sandwiches then I am sure you can visit the restaurant more than once to sample them all
4
Went to wild honey and I must admit that it is an awesome place to chill in the morning thou coffee was a lil over priced . However I was later then impressed with the huge breakfast portion when it was served to us. Will definately make another trip back .

Went here for a birthday brunch! Food was excellent. We tried the English & Norwegian breakfasts...The staff (especially at the entrance) were quite arrogant and rude. We were a little late (after making reservations) but the person at the reception refused to give us a table (even though it was a weekday and there were around 10 tables empty!!!). Kept arguing back and forth. Eventually he gave us a table after 15 minutes of constant requesting

We got told off by "mike" for being late. Our reservation was at 1000 and we arrived at 1020. We missed the 5min deadline for 15 min holding time. It could be because I made a reservation for 4, but there were 2 adults and 2 children. "Mike" claimed that they were running a business and they had many other customers waiting for a table, though there was no queue at all outside the restaurant. Service attitude was very poor. No food substitutions were allowed if there is a food item that you didn't want. The food was not spectacular. Pricing was very high. It was a poor dining experience: meant to be a birthday celebration but it got spoiled by the unwelcoming attitude

I've been to Wild Honey several times and the theme is consistent: the service is good and the atmosphere is really nice, but the food is overpriced and very underwhelming. As example, the Santa Fe breakfast (their version of huevos rancheros) advertised that is came with salsa, avocado and breakfast potatoes. The "salsa" was literally about 10-12 pieces of diced tomato, the avocado was 4-5 small chunks, and I could actually count the potato pieces on two hands (there actually were only 10 small, maybe 2cm sqauare diced pieces of potato on the plate.) I'm not looking for a gargantuan portion, but for $20 I would have expected proper salsa and at least a few more potatoes. In short, every time I've been to Wild Honey I've enjoyed being there however I always leave underwhelmed, hungry, disappointed and more out of pocket than I think I should have.

A very trendy but relaxed and friendly venue for lunch; gets very busy but the wait is worth it. Very good food and service in seemingly opulent surroundings. Quite unique in its presentation.

So love their egg benedict and English breakfast which me and my husband so loved it. Super recommended. My son love their hawain breakfast European breakfast & Belgian breakfast.

So after trying to decide where to grab some morning grub up pops the TV suggesting Wild Honey, a short google lasted and we found the restaurant. Was very busy which is always a good sign but no normal tables so we have the breakfast bar, I'm not fussy so this suited me. They don't have menus on the tables so you have to kinda stand and decide where others are queueing. I went for the Spanish breakfast which was lovely and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection. The Mrs had the Canadian (pancakes and bacon) was was equally impressed. A little over priced but with large portions it makes up for it
4
Comfy chairs, a verandah with views of the street, aircon and a diverse menu of Western-breakfast items - this is the brunch spot to be if you have a craving for some variant of bacon and eggs. I ordered a Mexican inspired egg dish and three sides for my daughter. Add a coffee and a juice, tax, tip and it came to about $60 so certainly way more than a local Kopi Tiam.
4
Choose from an international menu of all day breakfast. The plate is filling so if you have a child, you might wanna share your order. The milkshakes are great! The resto is situated inside a mall behind the Marriott hotel, full of designer shops. So you can do some shopping as well. Farther down the road is a plaza with cheaper shops selling everything that has to do with eyelashes, nails and hair. When reserving , choose the seat surrounded by the colorful carnival curtain with the city view

I finally landed a Saturday morning breakfast with visiting friends. The breakfast options are immense, everything you could dream of - from eggs to pancakes to everything in between, Western-style, hefty portions. I had the Canadian, which was pancakes with pancakes breakfast. Pretty tasty stuff, but nothing remarkable either. My pals all seemed to enjoy, so good reviews on the food, though expect to pay a premium. Service-wise - so/so. The front desk gent was very accommodating, even without availability, found us a place on the terrace and was very friendly to my little girl. As for the wait staff, they're just over-worked, not really paying attention to detail, and one or two with an attitude (bad that is), with one or two just lovely. So, a mixed bag. My advice - give it a go, but there are too many options to go here again and again
4
I had the generously-sized English breakfast: everything was nicely done and the bacon was crisp yet juicy. Their signature brioche was not eggy at all, and their baked beans were slightly spicy. For drinks, well, I thought the juices were a bit pricey for something so ordinary. It seems that the place is always packed, so it's a good idea to make a reservation
5
This is far and away the best breakfast place in Singapore. Attentive service and plenty of different delicious brekky a to choose from. The venue is nicely decorated and set out. Prices are reasonable. A good breakfast can be hard to find sometimes in Singapore. This place will definately not dissapoint.
4
I've been to Wild Honey a few times and I've not ever been disappointed. I've tried multiple dishes - The Californian (simple and delicious), Portobello Road (good complex flavours and perfectly poached eggs, and a delicious mild Hollandaise), Santa Fe (a good take on Huevos Rancheros - needs sharper seasoning though), & Corsican (gorgeously delicate) for mains. The Roasted Almond latte is the only drink I ever have there because it's so good!The food's always been top notch though a tad over-priced - most dishes are SGD 20+. The service excellent - very welcoming staff. I only wish they would specify why certain vegetarian sounding dishes are actually not so. For instance, their breakfast potatoes are roasted in duck fat, which was an unpleasant surprise. Despite that, I would recommend Wild Honey
4
I had lovely dining experience at Wild Honey not once but TWICE! The waiter/waitress were friendly and able to introduce to what they think you like according to your described preference, both main dish and beverage. There is also a special signature dish that is something not on the menu, just ask the waiter
5
Love the place here. Good food, great people. But slightly pricey. We ordered English breakfast & a HangOver Breakfast. Both were superb. Portion were quite big. Latte was served hot unlike some places, just warm.
4
we have first been to this restaurant, occupying a table for 5!
All of us enjoyed to the most for our breakfast and the most i like of course if the scone, i will be back soon!
3
The food were very presentable but the taste was just average. Had the Aussie breakfast, which was an unspectacular piece of steak, and the baby spinach salad which was quite bland.
Excellent ambience, a little understaffed, remember to book early.
3
Just went there with a group of friends for dinner. Food was very well presented and the service was very quick and efficient even though it was quite full. Had the steak sandwich which was very disappointing. Was pretty chewy and bland. Same comments about the steak from a friend who had the Aussie. Portion wise was pretty small as well. Definitely not filling enough for dinner. Overall good ambiance and quick service but food was bad and not worth the money. Would recommend that you give this place a miss unless there is no where else to go
1
This will be the first and last time we are visiting this restaurant. (A) there were plenty of empty tables but the waitress insisted that they were book at sat us at the bar counter(B) they only have breakfast menu... How many variety of egg dishes can u have??(c) S$30 per entree is just too pricey for breakfas
1
the cumberland sausage was not from Cumberland indeed it was not from anywhere in Europe, the scrambled eggs overcooked, the pancakes so heavy, i could use as doorstops. The bacon was grey and undercooked. On top of this, paying 16 SGD for bread. Absolute disgrace! Do yourself a favour and give this place a wide berth
4
Excellent breakfast and superb coffee. Beautifully presented French toast and fruit in a lovely setting. But .... Service is a bit of a let down. Needed to ask for more water and we would have had another coffee at $7.00 each if someone came to ask. You wait a long time to get your bill and then have to catch a servers eye in order to do so. It is very expensive in comparison to other places but the food is excellent and amazing menu choice
5
This place is hands down one of the best breakfast places I've had in quite a long time.The decor and ambiance of the restaurant are quite nice. It has really good service.Now when it comes to food, they have breakfast options from different cities / countries all over the world and some dishes are pretty interesting. They also have a nice selection of side dishes, drinks and desserts. The food is just amazing. I highly recommend this place
3
Booked at this place two weeks prior as it is just too packed. Ordered the European breakfast and the I Love New York. Presentation was quite average, especially the scrambled eggs. One look and you know that kitchen is too busy to bother. The eggs benedict wrapped in parma ham was quite all right. The portions quite ok. A lot of people so it's very crowded. The flavours were also quite ok. Not exceedingly good or extremely delicious. For the two breakfasts and 2 drinks (ice latte and wild iced tea) we were charged a total of 68 bucks. On the expensive side considering that it's not huge in portions or very tasty. Won't come back again. Just not worth it at all. Service was ok just had to wait quite a bit cause of the huge crowds. Probably would be better in terms of quality of food and service when it's less crowded
3
Went for the first time in a group of eight....thoughts as followsService - very polite but slow and could be more effective e.g. iced water was served to one person, when the rest came, no ice....coffee seemed to take ages even though the restaurant was probably 70% full...pretty inflexible as my daughter wanted mushrooms on the side but was told can only be on top but this was resolved.The quickest thing was the bill !!Food, wide variety of breakfasts, not that much other items for main courses and portions for Singapore are on the large side. Taste for me was good but no wow factor..Setting, very nice and tastefully furnishedPricing a bit on the high side however portions are largerOverall worth another visit and if they can improve the service they would get a higher rating from m
4
Wild Honey's menu is something to behold in itself. A creative and inspired selection of meals and beverages, that could keep you coming back time and time again.
Excellent service, really enjoyable atmosphere. Try it if you haven't.
5
Gorgeous food in a gorgeous setting... doesn't hurt that the restaurant also has some gorgeous people... We had the Norweign breakfast (smoked salmon, grilled asparagus, poached eggs on whole wheat brioche) and Sweet Morning - french toast suffed with grilled mango... The explosion of flavours were beyond anything I've had. Coffee was good too.. Be prepared to wait during weekend brunch hours. But in my opinion, well worth the wait.
2
Wild Honey at Scott's Square was disappointing...we made an online booking for one pm for Dec 31, was served at 1.15 and by 1.45 were told twice that the next group was waiting...what happened to our allocated 90 minutes??? Definitely not a place to hold a conversation n eat in peace..noisy to boo
3
All day breakfast was very good - coffee comes in small cups and no refills.Scotts Road was no waiting when I arrived at 09:30 and then was busy, busy by 10:00.Good choice for breakfast or brunch if you get tired of the hotel breakfast buffet
5
I am a breakfast lover and I LOVED it here! The menu is amazing with breakfast options from around the world - I found it difficult to choose. The food was beautifully presented, all fresh and good quality ingredients and I was extremely happy with my choice. Would highly recommend this place but book in advance and expect it to be busy!
5
Must say this was the perfect antidote to a hard night out. Full on gorgeous breakfast of smoked salmon and poached egg on a warm brioche. Delicious and filling. Perfectly cooked eggs were runny in the middle and looked like a picture on the plate. Service was fast and the staff were very nice, seating us at a corner table despite us being very late for our booking. A busy place with lots of diners, yet not loud or feeling super crowded. Lots of items on the menu. My hubby had the Moroccan brekkie which was equally filling. If you are into breakfast at any time of the day, this is the place. Value for money
4
I had been wanting to try here for some time. We fluked a verandah table (overlooking the hustle and bustle of Scotts Rd) without a booking at about 9.30 pm on a weekday - but the place was filling up very quickly - definately book on the weekend or you will be disappointed. The choices are extensive and all looked good. I settled on corn tortillas with eggs, and a salsa - tasty and enough. We both had a coffee - which tasted fine - but two mouthfuls and it was gone - aaaggghhh - not good for coffee lovers - come on guys offer a mug sized drink. Service was just OK - once the food was served then there was no coming by to see if things were OK or if you needed anything else
4
A restaurant that serves breakfast all day, how great is that? Not only does it have breakfast all day, but with influence from all over the world. From a traditional English breakfast, a New York influence with bagels and cream cheese, a Scandinavian with potato rosti and salmon. There are a selection of juices or sweet breakfast items. Its just a good all round menu that everyone will find someone on to indulge. The coffee is perfect, from texture and flavour. The atmosphere is nice too (there is also a small outdoor section) great funky decor that makes it easy to either dine alone or in a group. The service is attentive and friendly

Tried to reserve a seat for breakfast on monday but it was full so I couldn't get a seat until 3pm.The restaurant is located on the top floor of a small mall where many high end retailers are such as Hermes. The place is nicely done and the crowd was how I would describe upmarket. I think i was the only one with a backpack, slippers, and short. But I was there with a few colleagues for a meeting.They gave us the outdoor which was surprisingly nice and windy. I looked through the menu it was very creative. There were like 20 different breakfast items. After taking a closer look they are actually very similar to some other breakfast places but upon arriving they were actually very appetizing. All the presentation were spot on. Everything on the plate was BIG. Huge tomato, Huge slices of bread, Huge sausages. The smoked salmon was very generous. WOW!!! This place is always packed and this is the second outlet following their Mandarin Hotel Location. Taste wise I would say very good but I can say that not out of the ordinary. What sets them apart from other places would be portioning and presentation. All in all It was a very good dining experience.Pricing would be leaning towards expensive considering we were eating breakfast. But I guess location, portion, and ambiance can sort of make it up. One thing that stuck out as being negative was the staff. We had 2 staffs saying that "sorry we are new here, let me get my colleague." I think a restaurant this caliber should not have this kind of service. I wouldn't even consider them as friendly. Check the place out. Give yourself 3 minutes to appreciate the presentation and enjoy the food!!Oh ya. Just to make up for the service I must say that the host was very helpful and attentive about getting me the reservation for 3. We were a party of 8 and she gave it some thought on how to fit us considering a lot of the seatings were a 4 seaters.Will make a trip back when i visit singapore!

First time dining at Wild Honey and decided on the Scotts Square outlet as they take reservations. We made reservations at 1pm and upon arrival, we were ushered to our table immediately without any delay.All-day breakfast choices were great as it was vast plus other food choices and good drinks selections too. We had the English Breakfast and Boulevard St Michel. Delish!! Juices, mocktails were decent too though no one commented on the tea and coffee. A meal and drink sets you back abt SGD$30+ which is pretty decent. Some dislikes:- straws used for drinks were cute PAPER green spiral ones which after a few sips start turning soft (yucks!!). This also made it hard to suck the fruit pulp for our juices. - service was a tad slow but they were running on full house. - reservations are a must on weekends if u want to dine here and it must be done a few days before. Overall, I would visit again and try the other breakfast choices! :
4
Based on a tourism video we had brunch here whilst in Singapore. The selection and serves were large and tasty. Service was great. Would come back.
4
Overall no complaints. The food was good, staff was attentive and portions generous. It's a little more than we needed since my wife and I were traveling with friends and their 3 kids. Average price per person about 20 USD.
4
You can go around the world without leaving Singapore with a visit to Wild Honey. It features the world's best breakfast dishes and serves them up all day. The standard of food is excellent and the mocktails inventive and well executed. The restaurant caters well to big groups and even though we were just a table for two, we didn't feel crowded in or that the restaurant was overly noisy. Would definitely go back
4
We made a reservation online before we came because we tried to be there for brunch a week before, but the queue was so long that the waiter advised us to come back in an hour. Such a long queue is a testament to how popular and well-received Wild Honey is among diners. The establishment has a really spacious outlet, with diners seated at ample distance away from each other, allowing broad walking space. When we read the menu, we wished more than once that the menu had pictures on it to show how the dish looked like as well as knowing what ingredients were within. Diners are highly recommended to go to Wild Honey's website to get an idea of your choices before heading to the restaurant, or to bring a connected tablet to scroll through their website's menu in case there is any doubt on the dish's appeal to you. Some of the drinks resonated the restaurant's name by including honey in them, one of which was the honey mocktail series. I for one was intrigued and got myself a Banoffee Brulee - a milkshake with fresh banana (don't start singing Minions song now...), caramel, honey and crowned with flamed meringue toppings, this is one of those highly recommended and utterly memorable drinks I have sampled. The portion was enormous for a breakfast plate. The English breakfast, one of Wild Honey's signature dish, and Boulevard St Michel breakfast filled a hearty portion of the plate, no doubt an absolutely worthy offer for the price its price. Both of them, the former especially, allowed cautious diners to get something familiar on their plate if they objected to getting something novel on their first visit to Wild Honey, or if they found having all day breakfast during dinnertime more than enough novelty for them to bear. Doubtless to say, we were very impressed by our visit to Wild Honey, filled to the brim of our tummy with fulfilling goodies. Although the price tag was a tad on the expensive side, we find the experience totally worth it, and another revisit is definitely called for
5
What a great place. Mainly breakfast/brunch.We first attempted to go here on the weekend. .....that was silly. We went back on Tuesday for brunch and it was perfect. We were seated and had service very quickly. However the menu was very difficult to choose from..... delicious. Not cheap but nothing in Singapore is.Good value and more than I could eat

After having enjoyed Sweet Morning at Wild Honey in Mandarin Gallery, we made a reservation for 9 am on a public holiday at Wild Honey in Scotts Square. Nothing disappointed us except the absence of the Sweet Morning breakfast on the menu. It’s a good idea to reserve. When we arrived at 9, there was a queue of people waiting to be seated. We learned that we could be seated directly if we had a reservation. The good points:• Reservations possible• More private seating arrangements than in Mandarin Gallery• Extremely friendly and delightful staff. Everyone smiled and seemed happy to be working there.• Convenient location at Scotts Road in a very affluent mall• Outside seating• Food came promptly• Fresh-squeezed orange juice was delicious and pulpy• iPad menu with photo of each breakfast dish.I recommend the European and the Corsican breakfasts (S$20 each). The Corsican somehow manages to put sweet tasting feta cheese into an ultra-light omelet. Great flavor combination with the large cherry tomatoes on the side.The only minus would be that they didn't offer Sweet Morning breakfast. Food is expensive, but the whole experience is worth it. Every table at Wild Honey was occupied when we left at about 9:45 am. It is an idea place for a memorable breakfast or snack. We visited a day earlier for tea and strawberry tea bread, a light bread with crust and strawberry compute. It combines the "living room" atmosphere with taste combinations that were new to us. Highly recommended
1
came in this morning, fell in line, but the maitre d kept ignoring us and would serve other people in front of us even if we clearly can be seen as the first in line. never coming back. no system, just chaos. would not recommend it to anyone! mc donald's service is way better

Had heard a lot about this place (both their outlets). Was very excited to go there for the first time. We went to the Scotts one. The place does get crowded especially weekends. Reservations are a must. Better if you can book a day or two in advance. However, if that sort of trouble needs to be made on a Sunday morning then the charm somewhat goes away - at least to me - it is not unhurried and leisurely. Nevertheless, we were able to get a place on the day itself by booking as soon as they opened. The menu looks good. 3 of us had the set breakfasts. The English one was good except for the baked beans. I guess they tried to do something different - something classy & distinct. The outcome was beans that were big & whitish. Not bad but did not taste very English. The Tunisian looks exotic on the menu but was a bit flat in reality - but this maybe because I am Asian & used to spicy stuff. The cakes were good as also the juices. The waffles were OK. The decor of the restaurant is good. However, it is a bit too dark for me inside. It is also a bit too crowded. The alfresco / balcony area was nice and I would suggest that one sits there especially if you are a largish group and get the corner / end table.The service was OK. The staff were trying to be helpful and deliver a comfortable & enjoyable experience. The captains were succeeding in this but the general waiting & serving staff were falling a bit short. Attention span was low. To me the reason for this was the crowd present - too few staff chasing too many customers.Location of this outlet is good. Close to public transport. Parking is available in Scotts Square and for a Saturday morning it was quite empty for us. I am not too sure about the size of the parking though but there are many options in and around Scotts.Overall, too many downsides that smooth out the highs leading to an overall average experience. There is a lot of scope for improvement and to build on the good aspects

We have heard about this place for a while so ventured there for brunch with friends. The menu selection is wonderful and the food when it came was great. The English Breakfast one of the best (the best even) that I have had in Singapore. Their cakes and coffee great also. However, the service was poor and the music ruins the ambience of the lovely surrounds. We had a long wait for the food and when it arrived it was cold and had to be sent back. No apology from the manager who came to speak to us, only that they would replace it - and we weren't sure if he was doing us a favor ... ... It could and should have been so much better
4
we were there first thing at 9am when they opened. by 10am, the place is relatively crowded. so i think it is better to make a reservation if you are coming after 10am. the food is pricey - $24.00 for English & $19.00 for European breakfast and it does not include beverages. the quality of the food is excellent though. the cosy ambience of the restaurant is why you might want to splurge eating breakfast at this location. there is an outside seating too, which i heard the outlet at Mandarin Gallery doesn't have. The price might deter you from coming back
4
Has a wonderful collection of breakfasts from around the world which is served all day long.
Great for a visit but the high cost makes it prohibitive as a regular place for a meal.
Food is fresh but you pay a high price for it.
3
Head for a Sunday brunch. The waiting for seats was alright as they will give you a call when the table is ready. Sat down, quite friendly staffs. ordered food, had our food 1 hour later. It was too long of waiting time. Nice food just made the whole experience not as nice as it should be. I wish they should warn us or give us a head ups of the timing. otherwise food was nicely executed
3
Visited the place one Sunday Morning with my girl. While waiting for our food, my lil one did some coloring (I guess it's a normal thing to do for children to self entertain, is it not? As the matter of fact, most of the family restaurants even provide crayons for free). Anyhow, to my surprised, a Caucasian manager (I think he should be the manager) came up to us and in not a very pleasant manner told me,"Please don't let the child color here as it will stain the sofa!' then left. Food is good but with the attitude, I wont even bother to visit no more!!!
5
We stayed at the Hyatt next door and tried several places for breakfast in our 5 day stay in Singapore - not least with the Orang-utans at the Zoo. As always seems to be the way, we found the best place on the last day and right next door to us too!!We were just a walk in but were seated straight away. There was a lovely Kirstie Alley (from her time in Cheers) lookalike who was very attentive. The breakfast menu was so varied it took us a while to choose, but it was delicious and so nice to have a lovely caffetiere of French coffee. I think this was the best choice for breakfast, albeit quite expensive, but possibly our waist lines would have suffered if we'd come too often !
3
Wild Honey is located on the 3rd floor of a high-end shopping mall near the Hyatt hotel. It fits in well with its fancy retail neighbors with an elegant dining room appealing to a mixture of local and expat customers. I went on a Sunday morning before 10am without a reservation and was given a seat on an empty communal table with the warning that I had to give up my seat by 11am. Not the friendly start I was looking for!I enjoyed everything I ordered: granola and berries served with vanilla-flavored yogurt, orange juice spiced with ginger (especially good), peppermint tea and a cranberry scone served with butter and jam. Everything tasted fresh - no complaints. There's also free wi-fi. Service was polite, attentive, and not pushy.Would I go back? Probably. Was it outstanding and memorable? Not especially. Prices are on the high side, unsurprising given the location
5
As travellers always on the look out for a great breakfast, Wild Honey did not disappoint. It was a little tricky to get to in Scott's Square, and was quite busy at about 11.00am on a Tuesday morning. The menu layout of breakfasts from around the world is a great idea! Our party had The Canadian (pancakes and bacon) The Santa Fe (egg, bacon and salsa buritto) The French? (Eggs Benedict) and the Moroccan (spicy skillet) and we all enjoyed the large portions very much and ended up sharing. The drinks and service was also very good. Definately a great breakfast spot
3
It was a extra long weekend Saturday evening when we visited, but the young and cheerful team still showed the most warm and professional service. Great team work and service standards!The food looked and sounded better than it tasted. Which should be something they can rectify easily since they created the menu and only serve breakfast all day.Atmosphere was unveatable especially with the balcony seats. Commanding a view of the most iconic junction in the country, with a slow evening breeze. Start your evening with a happy hour aperitif at the Grand Hyatt next door, add company, good conversation and you have yourself one of the best night outs in Singapore
4
My boyfriend and I stopped by here for a late morning breakfast. He had the full english breakfast and I had the californian breakfast. The quantities were good, and we were very fully after our meal. The restaurant is located in quite a post mall on orchard road and seems to be a popular haunt for expats. Since we are living in Singapore for a short term it was a good idea to visit this place, but would probably not recommend it for young tourists (We are in our mid-late twenties). We paid $74 for breakfast for 2 people, and in a city like Singapore you can easily eat 3 meals for that much money. (For example, I paid $9 for a glass of orange juice, and earlier in the day I'd paid $3 in a food court.) Bit of an extravagant breakfast, but if you are living here, or fancy something expensive then this is the right place. We were seating immediately, got seating on the balcony and it was a quite a nice view. So far we found a lot of places in Singapore to be quite loud, but this place was nice and calm and we could eat our meal calmly, and then just chill for a bit longer afterwards. Also they have free wi-fi which doesn't hurt
5
Don't be put off by the high end shops as you enter Scott's square, just by hyatt hotel. The third floor houses wild honey!! An amazingly good choice for breakfasts-served all day. Choices from around the world (around 15 different ones) we had Santa fe and Canadian and split between two, pancakes great but very sweet!! We'll be back in two weeks. Cost us 60$ for two breakfasts and 2 milkshakes!!
5
We had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant is in a fancy high-end mall and we weren't interested in any of the shops, so just sat outside. It was worth the wait! Possibly the best breakfast we've had. The menu is geographically themed. We can recommend the Boulevard St Michel and the Portobello Road, but seriously, you could probably point at the menu blindfolded and land on a winner
4
Love the concept of having breakfast from all over the world. It's very memorable and unique. Service was alright! 4 of us sharing 3 dishes! Can't get this type of restaurant anywhere!
4
Honestly, one of my fave brunch places. I like the selection. Only gripe i have, the quality seems to be falling although prices seems to be creeping up.
5
Fantastic - enough said. Breakfast from all over the world and comfy decor makes this a purrrfect spot for a cosy brunch!
5
Amazing food , great decor , good value and very efficient and friendly service .Probably one of the nicest hang out around . An extensive all day breakfast menu where you feel like trying them all .Today i enjoyed very much " The Tunisian " !The fresh juices are exceptionally good as is everything i did try so far .Wild Honey is enjoying a well deserved success , and is always busy with a classy eclectic crowd
5
Great place for breakfast or brunch.....the maybe 20 different ways that you can order breakfast mean that there is something for everyone. I have eaten here maybe 5 or 6 times and have tried something different everytime - today was the Aussie - hearty and tasty but our favourite is the Norwegian....eggs with smoked salmon and asparagus....beautifully presented and delicious.Coffee is good too and the decor is cosy and home feeling.This is a really good spot for breakfast, brunch for two or larger groups....you'll need a booking but there's a lot of reasons why this restaurant is always busy - it's that good
4
Had breakfast for lunch here. They are noted for their good variety of breakfasts. Lots of choices that would give you quite a hard time because everything sounds so good.I had an English Breakfast and the food was pretty good. Portions were fairly large but manageable. The place was rather noisy and we had to wait a bit because of the brisk business. They kindly took down our number and called us when a place was ready.Only thing - be prepared to pay a bit more. The prices are fair for what they serve, but not everyone fancies that
3
They serve breakfasts whole day. But for my taste all portions are too big. You hardly eat just a half of it. But pay a lot. I took pancakes which were very thick, big and uncooked inside. So I could eat a few. In general this place is nice as the atmosphere is friendly and the service is good. But onley for people who like this style of food
4
Wild Honey serves one of the best English Breakfast in town. Whenever I missed eating English Breakfast set, I will go to Wild Honey.It is different from the traditional English Breakfast that is usually serve in Singapore. The taste is more towards England style. But the price is also expensive too. The cost is around S$24 but is very filling too. I will usually add on a cup of Hazelnut latte to go with the set. It's my third visit this year and I still order the same set of English Breakfast!I prefer to the outlet at Scotts Square but it is quite crowding during weekend and noisy too. If you have the chance, go during weekday afternoon to enjoy the food. Scotts Square is the only outlet that allows online reservation. So book in advance
4
The chicken chop chop salad is an surprisingly delicious new twist on salad, I ordered it on a whim and glad I did. The sandwiches were good too as well as the other menu selections. However, the coffee needs to catch up with the level of the food. It is, how do I put this gently, Starbucks quality
5
We dined at both Wild Honey locations when we were in Singapore in February 2013. We were impressed by the creative menu and the variety of the dishes made it difficult to choose just one. Every dish we tried was delicious; the staff was friendly and helpful; the restaurant itself was beautiful and comfortable; and the prices, based on other dining experiences in Singapore, did not seem to us to be out of line. In short, we had fabulous food in a lovely setting and would happily return
4
I liked the ambience, quiet location, nice interior.
All day breakfast selection was superb, tho pricey.

Wow a sensational place. Serving fantastic coffee "real Melbourne quality" After travelling for 3 weeks we arrived in Singapore. On recomendation we headed to Wild Honey. Service out standing! Coffee exceptional. My breakfast Boulevard St Michel to die for. Price who cares! Value worth every cent

I heard a lot about Wild Honey, many friends recommended that I have to try their all day brunch menu, which I did. I did not even bother to make a booking and walked in late on Saturday morning, I was lucky to be able to get a seat (it is usually full and ppl have to wait for hours on the waiting list) - my secret, ask to sit on the high table, its a bit uncomfortable which is why most ppl dont like to sit there.I have to say that they do have a large selection of different "internationally themed" breakfast options. Being my first visit, I decided to pick the "chef's recommended" English Breakfast.Portions were large, taste wise - it was ok; not outstanding. I had high expectations but it wasn't too great nor too bad, it was rather average.Service wise, I have to give the waiters an A+, they were attentive, polite, friendly and prompt

I had heard good things about Wild Honey and wasn't disappointed with the food. Breakfast/brunch food is the primary item on the menu, and there is a decent selection to be had.I did find the service a little bit slow, waiting 10 minutes before receiving a glass of water, which seems excessive. The prices are a little on the expensive side, but the food, flavours and presentation are impressive. The decor is relaxing with subtle, warm tones, however, like a lot of restaurants in Singapore, the lack of space between other tables irritated me. There is no need to squash so many tables so close together...give diners a little bit more space for personal comfort, particularly when you want them to sit, order and eat within 90 minutes! I would recommend a visit

We have been to Wild Honey (both Scotts Square and Mandarin Gallery branches) on many occasions. As you can't book in the Mandarin Gallery branch we usually opt to book at Scotts Square (although you need to book several days before if you want a Sat/Sun morning slot, unless you're prepared to wait).Today we had a booking at 10.30am and arrived at 10.30am on the dot. We told the hostess our name and that we had a reservation which she acknowledged and said they were waiting for the table to become free. We then had to wait 15 minutes standing by the door before being taken to one of their breakfast bar tables (which are high bar stools facing a wall with a small area for eating). As we were there to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday I asked for a proper table and was told the only other choice was to sit at the end of a long table sharing with a big party. I was not impressed and explained how I'd booked a week ago and expected to sit at a comfortable table which we had to ourselves. At that point the hostess (the same one who had greeted us when we arrived) asked slightly bemused 'Oh you have a booking?' We then went through our booking details again and were shown to a proper table. At this stage I was a bit irritated for the waiting around and the confusion but we sat down and were given menus and started to enjoy our visit.After 5 minutes, the hostess came back to us and asked us to move to a smaller table (for two people) as we were on a table which sat four. We agreed and there was a bit of a fuss getting the new table cleaned so we could move across. The hostess sat us down at the new table and asked us what we'd like to drink. We ordered two coffees. A while later a waiter came to take our food orders and we explained we had ordered two coffees which had not yet arrived (and could he check if they were on their way). He went away to check and then came back to ask us what drinks we had ordered.... so we re-ordered the coffees.The whole organisation of the place was chaotic. I do not personally blame the hostess as she was being expected to deal with lots of people - drop ins, reservations and phone calls. It has always been busy when we have come on previous occasions but this time the disorganisation was very apparent and first impressions are so important - within the first 20 minutes we had to wait standing around, move tables and re-order drinks. We also felt under pressure as we had been told we only had the table until 12pm, which is slightly unfair when we only got to our final table at 10.50am.As we have been to Wild Honey a few times we have certain expectations about the food which is normally top notch. Today we ordered The Norwegian and Portobello Road, both we have ordered before (in fact The Norwegian is a firm favourite of my other half and he has it every time he goes). The food was tepid at best and the poached eggs were hard. This was really disappointing as they are always done perfectly. Both breakfasts also only had a very small amount of hollandaise sauce on them so overall they were very dry. Really disappointing as the flavours of the food are fantastic.The whole experience was underwhelming, especially given our high expectations based on our many previous visits. We paid $75 for two breakfasts, a small side order of potatoes and two small coffees and I couldn't help feeling this was a ridiculous price for the service and quality of food we received.To summarise, I really felt the standards have slipped in this place which has been very impressive on previous visits. At a premium price, I don't feel you can make these kinds of mistakes. Consistency is vital. Or if you do make errors, why not offer your guests a free coffee or a small gesture to acknowledge this and make your guests feel valued? We left feeling the opposite. The priority seems to be on cramming people in and getting as many orders through as possible. I can't help feeling Wild Honey has let it's success go to its head a little and if they are not careful they will lose previously loyal customers like us

Ambiance, food and service - that's really all that matters.Reservations was a breeze for this place. Just click, submit and appear at your designated time slot and you're led immediately to your table. Only caveat: your understanding is sought to finish your meal in 90mins. A reasonable request since they accommodated your reservations and they need to accommodate others' as well. Restaurant manager (?) was friendly and humorous as he animatedly described the special (Spanish Hash!) of the day. Food was served fast. Water was topped up promptly. Yet, the setting remained relax and casual. I thought price was slightly high but overall a great place for all day breakfast

We took some friends for Sunday brunch, on recommendation from a friend (who we bumped into whilst we were there, he likes it so much).You MUST reserve, sometimes a fortnight in advance, or you are in for a long wait here! Even with a reservation we waited ten minutes for our table. You are rationed to 90 minutes for your breakfast, sot hey can cater to the customer demand.Great decor: quirky, funky, warm and comfortable. Caters for small and large groups.A terrific choice of food. I'd say the sandwich I had (entitled "hangover breakfast sandwich") was the best breakfast I have eaten since I've been here in Singapore! Everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their food too.We would highly recommend the bread basket - especially the scones.Juices and coffees and 'mocktails' are all excellent.If the weather is questionable I'd suggest not sitting on the terrace, as it was terrible weather when we left and the terrace was almost unusable.Only one criticism which is that you must stick to the menu. My husband wanted a fried egg with his breakfast and they could not cater for a side order like this, which wasn't on the menu. Still - this was a very minor thing

I had the eggs benedict there which was really really tastey, but for $19, it's a bit pricey. The ambiance of the place is really nice and cozy though. The food was adequate, but I was still feeling a bit hungry afterwards. I was there for a late lunch, so maybe having this for breakfast would have been adequate. I tend to eat more during lunch times

We were looking for a breakfast venue close to our accommodation. Wild Honey came up in the top 5 places in Singapore in Google. We concur. The menu was interesting, the decor was eclectic and location was perfect for us. The food was well presented, not cheap but good portions to keep you going for a big sightseeing day. The staff were friendly and the owner took a personal interest in all his guests. He made us feel welcome which created a warm and inviting environmentThis is on our list of return venues next time we visit Singapore
