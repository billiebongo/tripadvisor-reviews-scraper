Will be back after a pleasant meal last week. Good environment for dining and sampling its excellent range of wines.

I reckon that 340 excellent reviews beat the 14 whingers who probably never been to a nice restaurant, are impossible to please or are just plain kients!Anyhow, I have believed the majority and was still surprised in more than just a positive way:- Top service personnel, friendly, prompt and attentive- Gourmet food!- Great wine!Started with the prawns which blew me away and as an Australian I reckon we are spoiled with quality but those gambas were nothing shy of the stuff you would get down under.The Pizza was outstanding and would rival anything out of Naples and the pork ribs succulent and tasty AF!Had the Weissbier right out of Bavaria which would beat the stuff they make locally at Paulaner and the Spanish Red, Tempranillo Reserva, was more than good value and outstanding!To finish off, I had the creme brulee with their dessert wines and if their would be one point of criticism it would be the absence of a herbal liqueur or any spirit at all.They explained to me that the strong stuff is not moving and knowing Singas tax on booze I wouldn’t keep 1000s of dollars of cash flow bound on a shelf neither so def not a reason to rate down the experience.Will be back on me own and def with me wife as well, great place, great experience, great service and most of all: Great food

An american or an aussie eating steak weekly will have high expectation of their steak so no surprises if they don’t rate this high as there re tons of great steak houses back homeTo be fair, this restaurant caters to majority of singaporean middle class living around hillview or working in the nearby industrial zones whom would like their steak here. i had mine and it was good ! there s always comparisons with steak back home and chain stores including ruby tuesday etc and the comments can be pretty legitManagement need not be apologetic here over what is expensive steak in view of the high overheads !however the thin pizza could be fatter ! i will return

The food quality is mostly acceptable but it’s not worth the price. Pasta portions are barely sufficient for one. The pizza dough is almost paper thin and pretty burnt because of that. The steak is small for the price but reasonably cooked and not over dry. The root vegetables that comes with the steak are swimming in oil, a lot of oil. We opted not to have the dessert. Basically, the quality has been sacrificed for profits. When I asked for Parmesan cheese, it came in a small little saucer. Never again
3
Felt like a step above Olive Garden (chain US restaurant). Surprised it is ranked as a top 500 restaurant in Singapore (let alone top 30). We won’t be back
4
We went there following the tripadvisor suggestion: in general good but not a real italian flavours...pizza too thin, carpaccio and meat with too much sauces, spicy and heavy...overall a good restaurant, but indeed not an excellent italian restauran
4
One of my favourites in Singapore. The cozy little place is easy to get to and food and services is good! You can just relax and have a good meal with friends! Add a bottle of wine to your relaxing meal!Hassle free, quiet place for heart to heart talk with friends !!
4
Good menu options and nice ambiance. Accessible via MRT to Hillview station. Parking is easy especially on weekdays. Would recommend the pizza and braised lamb shank. Servers are not very attentive, diners just need to be patient
4
I have been a regular for much of 2017 the location I feel sets the stage in amongst lush greenery and the quietness of a residential area. the Wine selection is fabulous for this type of establishment and a great deal of food to either graze on or have a complete meal.....cold cuts and cheese are high on the list as well as a few of the pasta dishes. great value for Singapor

Hi there! I haven't even eaten at your restaurant but I am in high praise of one of your staff Satish (again not sure if correctly spelled, apologies if I got it wrong) who took my reservation first about a week ago. I mentioned to him I would be celebrating my girlfriend's birthday there and was wondering whether a slice of cake could be arranged and he unassumingly told me that it could be. Fast forward one week later. I called in to change my reservation from evening to lunch and he not only remembered my name just by hearing my voice but also kindly offered to arrange for the cake for my girlfriend with one of his fellow staff even though he won't be working during that shift. This is service at it's most dedicated excellence. I salute you Satish for going the extra mile and I look forward to dining at Wine Connection for a memorable experience with my girlfriend and also to meet you in person again soon Satish. :)God Bless,Andre
5
Food here is awesome! Shidah our waitress was an excellent host! Very warm and friendly. She really provided us with excellent service and recommended what to order. We will definitely come back for the quality food and wonderful service:)
5
Interestingly, my wine glass didn't fall below the 50% mark. Those who knows how to appreciate wine out there, that was the highest calling ever. Join me. Shidah and Satish is a very good at service and friendly
4
Great selection of wines at Singaporean prices (high). Perfect wine pairing made by the someller if you happen to need some help
3
Just fine... Went there 1.5 hour before closing time, so not much to say. I think better to come there early evening, food is okay and wine is good...
5
Banger and mash is yummy. Parma ham and seafood appetizer are just ok. The wine is good. Overall the price is reasonable. Need to make reservation before coming here.
1
First time dine at this outlet, the Fish and chip is horrible, it taste like the fish did not defrost probably before it cook, we complaint to a Philippino waitress, her face is not happy and tell us will check but never come back to us. Cheese pizza is horrible, we only eat less then half. Will never come here again.
5
I am very familiar with some of the Wine Connection outlets but this was my first time in the Wine Connection Bistro at HillV2. We had a Roast Beef Salad, Penne Carbonara, Lamb Shank and a Cheese Platter with a bottle of Negromaro wine. As a summary ........ i will become a regular here! Great food and wine, great service and atmosphere. Very very reasonable prices.Excellent value for money.See you soon!!!!
2
Finished my mains and my Mumâ€™s sea bass is not served. Really slow service. Had to wait another 15 mins for the bill to come.
1
Their paella was an orange coloured pan of steamed rice. No char or flavour. The crab meat linguine was poorly cooked and stuck together. Avoid
1
I got in at 6.34pm and have been waiting for my food till 7.45pm . *Officially bad listing this place* We just had a bad encounter a couple of months back. We decided to give it a try as we like the food there. My girl & I ended up leaving the place without having our dinner. They only managed to serve my son & hubby's mains (sequence: my son finished his pasta then my hubby's steak was served). Sadly, our starter was no where to be found. Those diners who came in so much later was served with the starter and mains we ordered. .No apologies and explanation from the waitress and manager. I was upset the way the manager replied to our query. He turned away before he could finish a conversation with us! . I almost lost my cool to that bad service attitude. If you can't tolerate bad service attitude and proud behaviour, would recommend you not to go there.
5
Server Igor was very attentive :) Ambience is good, food is good. excellent! Will be back. Highly recommended.
4
Nice to be here again next time with the gangs. Nice place good ambiance and nice foods. We like the taste of layered eggplant & zucchini with feta.
5
I came with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised! The food is top notch and I found lots of choices as a vegetarian.
5
The staff are very accommodating even if we arrived from our scheduled reservation time. They also accommodated our request for moving from one table to another. Food is delist. We will definitely come back here.
5
The sides, mains and desserts here are amazing! Coupled with the good ambience, this is the perfect place for a satisfying dining experience.
3
came here at 10pm for some post dinner drinks. after getting seated, we waited for 15mins and still no one came to take our orders, so we tried to walk up to a server to place our orders. to our surprise, he said he will come find us later. some other odd service experiences would be the cold shrugs and unhappy expressions (when we thanked them for the receipt), or when they dripped some water on us, or when they eagerly poured out the wine from the bottle to fill up our glasses (nearly to the brim) so as to quickly clear up. have been a regular customer here and enjoyed the convenience of a trusted wine place near my home, but my most unsatisfying experience to date. would avoid this place for awhile till the service standards buck up
5
The food here is simply amazing. Had the set lunch with a friend and both of us enjoyed it tremendously. For $18 I had a Greek salad and chicken parmigiana. My friend had the mushroom soup and fish and chips. Will definitely be coming here often
5
Great food with amazing serving sizes. Staff are attentive and friendly. Value for money. Definitely better than expected. We'll be back for more with the rest of the family
5
I took my wife here for a surprise dinner, after getting our kids situated at home. Parking is around back and you MUST enjoy the use of the complimentary valet parking!!We called ahead but found out reservations not needed after 7pm...got there at 7:30pm and were seated right away.We found the ambience, food, and service (mainly by Zack) were excellent at Wjne Connection. The food menu and wine list were broad and can meet everyone's tastes. I would highly recommend the appetisers, steaks, and red wines (chateau de lisse). Unfortunately my date does not drink, so I could not take the bottle of Bordeaux Malbec for only 38 SGD!We enjoyed our evening greatly and left filled with great food and memories. We would definitely recommend this place and come back again soon

I called up Wine Connection Hillview 2 outlet a while ago ( @ Singapore Time 2135hrs on 24 April ) to make a reservation for coming Saturday (29 April) for 3 persons at 730pm. A male staff who perhaps can't converse in English made me repeat my surname (Chang) 8 times, mobile number more than 10 times till he gave up and simply said 'your reservation is confirmed'. I made him repeat my reservation details and realized he still got my name&number wrong! Only correct information is 3 persons on Saturday at 730pm. I thus requested him to get another staff to take over this call, since total 4 mins were wasted in incredible frustration. I could hear clearly the said male staff passed nasty remarks against me in his broken English before a female staff took over after a minute or so. After made me repeat all the information again, to my greatest surprise, she said 'we don't take reservation at 730pm on Saturdays..' Well, after much time and effort wasted, I decided to go another restaurant on Saturday since Wine Connection Hillview2 staff have spared no efforts to invite us out. Nevertheless, were I the owner of this Restaurant, I wouldn't keep such staff to go all the way to chase customers away
5
Nice ambient, good service and the food was great! Excellent service, despite the distance away from the city, but this place is worth the visit
4
Ambience is good and is very suitable for couples looking for a place to sit down and chill. friendly and attentive staff.
4
The atmosphere is good and have a wonderful time and enjoy the food. The service is very good and the staff is very friendly
4
food here is pretty decent, but this place is mainly for wine lovers! has an area to shop for wholesale wine as well. good service, and nice relaxing vibes.
5
I love going to this place over and over again simply bcos the food, ambience and staff are awesome. The lava cake especially with vanilla ice cream was exceptionally wonderful.
5
Cosy ambience, great value for money for drinks.
Attentive service, waitress was knowledgable about the wines on the menu. 'Twas a great help.
Amazing experience overall.
Will definitely come back , no doubt.
5
Great place, location & prices. food is good and prices are reasonable
will surely return again. escpecially for dinner. ambienece is great
5
Cosy ambience, attentive service and great value for money for food and drinks!
Always love coming back!
5
Been here couple of times. Foods quality and variety was good. Service level was good in general though could be better if the crowd is not big in the restaurant. Wine selection has improved over time. Great place to chill up in the evening. Booking is necessary for weekend
5
Food, service, and wine is good. Nice atmosphere. Very helpful waitress who was knowledgeable about the wines. Only wish it opened till later
4
The food was good. The service was great. It was an overall pleasant lunch. We had the paella which was very tasty. The fish and chips and chicken parmigiana were well made.
4
It's a great place for dinner. This was recommend by my Singapore friend, never disappoint me! My last dinner at Singapore with full of memory. Thanks to everyone, service is excellent!
5
Staff were very helpful and service oriented. Food is also affordable and inexpensive so were the wines (bottle). Definitely will go back for more.
5
Jerrick has good knowledge when it comes to wine and is very helpful. Will come back again. Wide selection of wine.

I took a friend for her birthday dinner to Wine Connection at HILLV2. The service was horrible. Alrhough I had made reservations, we waited at the entrance for the staff to notice us. The staff did notice us standing there for quite sometime but chose to ignore us. Finally, we were seated. When I questioned one of the service staff, she replied it was because they are very busy. Being busy is not a valid reason to ignore customers. Then the waiter who took our order rambled through and was in a hurry and didnt seem interested. There was a floor manager who was walking about asking customers about how their dinner was. He asked the people on our left and on our right who were about 2 feet away from us. We must have looked so scary that he didnt dare to approach us or was too shy to ask us. Poor customer service. This will be the first and the last time we will dine at Wine Connection. I hope they look into their practices and put in place a system. Hopefully they will treat all customers equally. A true disappointment and over rate
5
Great dinner with the family. The food and ambience were excellent. So was the service. We ordered the garden salad which was a tad sour for our palate. We informed the waiter who quickly replace it with another helping, this time the salad separated from the sauce. The apple crumble was enjoyable - it is THE recommended dessert. We will indeed return for another meal
3
On the day of my visit this place seemed to be like a noisy children playground ! Disagreeable in what should be a "bistro" and "wine" place. Just for this prefer to go back to the other locations (e.g. Cuppage). Service awful , slow disorganized, serve one person and make other persons at the table wait 20 min at least ! Unacceptable.Food came cold !! When brought this to the attention of a waiter , shocked by the blunt out of place reply he gave us "no it's not cold" !!! Shocking ! we told him in a different tone "hold the plate (which was cold) and tell us if it is warm " , more shocking this fellow put his index finger ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGES in our plate for a while to check the veracity of our complaint !!! Never seen , nor experienced this NOWHERE in the world (I am in my sixties ). This is utterly disgusting. Waiters should be trained very very properly before being allowed to serve customers
5
Great service. Knowledgeable staff and nice ambience. Mi like the idea that this place is quiet and the server jerriek is really attentive and convinced us to try the wine which turned out grea
1
Extremely slow service. Food served was hardly warm. I can see that your service crew are overwhelmed. They were literally running from table to table. This is clearly a management issue
1
The food is good. But the way it is serve is very bad. 2 of us have spaghetti and 1 ordered steak. Steaks comes 10min after the spaghetti. This is embarrassing for the host as the guest have to wait to begin eating. The same desert we ordered 2 apple crumble and 1 come out and the other few min later. The same desert but come out different time. Complained and as usual they have excuse saying it's the way they serve
4
excellent service and value for money prices especially with wine. cosy ambience.
away form the bustle of the city
4
I had a gathering at this place w my old friends- maybe there were too many of us but I feel service crew keep mixing up our orders from ordering to serving. But overall atmosphere is nice and a good place to chillax.
4
Went with the family for a Sunday night dinner ,ordered steak, pasta and soup. The menu is not modern or innovative but traditional French all well cooked.
4
I came upon the review for Wine Connection Bistro on Tripadvisor while looking for idea of where to go for dinner. So we decided to give it a try. The restaurant at first glance was that it was quite cozy and not too noisy. We have tried quite a bit of the menu, and most items are pretty decent. The pizza and steak is pretty good. Even my young son enjoys the Spaghetti Bolognese and would finish every morsel of it even though it is a pretty decent sized serving.The selection of wine is pretty decent as well, especially since they have their own wine store next to the restaurant.We have since been back to the restaurant many times, and we are always greeted and served by friendly staffs. The restaurant is suitable for a nice dinner among friends or family
4
This is a nice resturant for a family outing with good choices of pizza, pasta and mains. Prices are very reasonable from $13 onwards for pizza and pasta. They also service set lunches from $18 that comes with a main and salad or soup. Service is fast and they still serve water for free! The place can get crowded but they don't linger, so your wait should not be too long. The only "con" about this place is the parking on weekends
4
Good ambiance and services. We ordered pizzas which is quite good. My Daughter ordered chorizo fettuccini which she found superb
5
I have been to all the wine connection branches in Singapore and in my opinion the hillview one is the best in terms of service. Menu and range of wine is more or less the same in all branches. Although the hillview branch is a bit out of the way, the ambience and service definitely makes up for it. Look out for their monthly wine deals. Great place to hang out with friends
5
Wanted to have a peaceful dinner with a glass of wine . Stepped inside wine connection expecting it's not gonna be busy as it was Monday . But the place was quite busy . Even though they has very less staff they were very attentive. The service was so fast and the food and drinks came very fast as  Have to mention about the manager Jonalyn and staff Satish , they were very attentive and gave a great service . The water was topped up every time when the glass was empty. The food was so nice the Caesar salad is highly recommended if you wanna start with a salad . The Zinfandel by the glass was really worth for the price. Over all it's a place where you can have a great service and tasty food at very reasonable price
5
They've recently changed their menu and there's a lot more variety! The seafood bowl was really good. I also recommend the assorted platter to go with the wine. The service staff were very attentive and friendly as well
5
I visited this restaurant twice when I was in Singapore. Couldn't try everything in the menu. I recommend the cheese platter along with the wine. Garlic prawns are good as starters and pasta is a must try. Beautiful and lively ambience. Recommended
5
Great service! Wine knowledge established with the effort to connect to customers. Recommended for a relaxed chill.
3
What is attractive is the good lighting and ambience, coupled with hearty food at affordable prices.
5
The food was in appropriate portions and the servers are really professional. Servers will check in with you to enquirer if you have any other needs.
5
The wine connection bistro and HillV2 is a great place to stop in if you're looking for a good selection of wines at decent prices. The food choices are good as well and the ambience is perfect.
5
Great food overall, and the service was extremely commendable. Would definitely come here again with my friends and family.
5
Nice atmosphere and a great service to go with. Attentive staff. Overall a wonderful experience for all of us.
5
Popped in on the off chance and glad we did. Food was excellent and reasonably priced. We had a bottle of proseco too which was also very well priced. There were new waiting staff being trained that day and they were all lovely, friendly and rounded off a very nice dining experience. I will use again for sure
3
The food was not bad and service exemplary. The servers were gracious enough to change us to another table when we had more people joining us. I would recommend trying the Apple crumble as it came out warm like it should! My Uncle and cousins enjoyed the food here
4
Unanimous agreement that the food was delicious and the portions were generous. The burrata was tasty while the Gambas were tantalising and fresh. For main course, the sirloin steak and the pork chop won hands down. Ended off with Creme burlee (didn't really enjoy it) but the lava cake saved dessert. Service was impeccable
5
The menu has a wide variety of selections for you to choose from, from pasta to pizza, and from steak to pork ribs! The value meals are quite affordable considering that it includes drinks, appetiser and the main course itself for just $18. The staff are quite friendly and will assist you with a smile, and the ambience was just right with Christmas music playing with Christmas just around the corner
4
Great service definitely recommended place to come. Great food and wine. Will definitely come back again
5
I love this restaurants specially when i crave for mussel, and its just around our place.. i like their wines and they have good price..
5
For a variety of quality wines and food as accompaniment, look no further than wine connection. With a comfortable setting for family and friends paired with reasonable prices, this is a place that truly fits all.
5
First time here with friends, food is nice and waitress is friendly. The ambience is good for catch-up with friends.
5
Nice cosy pizza joint away from the hustle and bustle. Child friendly place. Great food for all ages and great service. Keep up the good works guys!
5
The food and wine were fantastic and reasonably priced. Will definitely come back again! Worthy of the price given the quality of food and service!
5
Service is good, food is good as well. But the lighting is quite bad :( not able to take nice photos for my birthday celebration. But overall, will recommend this place for a nice family/friends/couple dinner :)
5
My second time here. Love it the first time when friends brought me here that I made a mental note that I must bring my family here. And I did. Hubby, Daughter and Son....Everyone loves everything about this place! Especially the food! We will definitely visit again
1
We go here so often and really enjoy it, so it was the obvious choice for my son who chose it for his birthday dinner. I told staff it was his birthday and they kindly offered cake on the house, very nice. However it all went wrong from there. We ordered steaks which took 40 minutes to arrive. Mine was cold so I sent it back, when my new one arrived it was tiny and the potatoes were cold. I finished and still my husbands meal had not arrived so he cancelled it and went hungry instead. Staff were nice about it and apologised but A really poor experience from a usually good one. It wasn't even busy so no excuses
5
I'm a regular guest at this place. The food is excellent, and so is the service and the entire atmosphere. The prices are also not high. All in all, highly recommended
4
Had such a great evening at wine connection last night ! Fabulous food and excellent customer service
5
Great atmosphere and service. Delicious food with very unique Flavours definitely would come again. 8/10
5
Food is good
Wine selection is excellent
Service is second to none
My friends and I have always enjoyed coming here
5
My 4th visit here. Service is superb and very friendly stuff. Highly recommended.
Cheap and with the visit
5
Affordable food & drinks + great service! Royal chocolate cake was very good. Great selection of wines too
4
The ambience here is amazing and the food is rather good. The staff are friendly and approachable. Will definitely come here again.
4
To start off, the atmosphere of the entire restaurant is delightful. A clever blend of cosy yet classy. The food was served with surprising efficiency given that it is a Friday night. Service was splendid and the white wine recommendation was superb and just right for our delicate tastebuds. We will definitely visit again
5
The service staffs here are very professional and very knowledgeable. The service staff here are very friendly, professional and their service is exceptionally superb. The food is excellent. Highly recommended for any gatherings as well as family dining
3
Actually outlet and menu is good , but it's not flexible at all.Even a simple thing as first and second course they can't .As a regular I would really appreciate if you can consider some flexibility in service. But our waitress, Miss Ashley .She was very good in service 
3
It's not a bad lunch offer $15+ or $18+ for a main course & a soup/salad or dessert. The beef sirloin is so-so but I like the crab bisque & the apple crumble wil bring back for more. $7 for a wine is also good offer.
5
Awesome great service and food quality!! Staff are friendly and helpful. Can feel that this joint has a great future...
5
Friendly waitress and waiters, conducive environment for dinning and the food here is worth its price.
5
I had drinks and dessert with my friends. The staff is very friendly and helped us with the menu. Will come back again.
5
It's unlike other place with a big crowd. This place is nice quiet and chilling. Staffs are very friendly here, they are consistently checking on the food and services that hey provided. Food are nice as well as the drinks!! Good service and thumbs up!!!!
5
Nice place to chill with great food and wine. Ashley is very friendly and attentive with Gd recommendation for wine
5
The food was very well served and tasty. Even though the food was only fish & chips, it was very neatly done. Waiter Satish have provided a memorable service. Very good job done. The visit is to remembered and will definitely come back again. Friendly and smiling crews really made my day
4
Love the selection of wine at wine connection. One of the better bread basket I ever I ever had. If you're looking for a quiet and less crowded place to enjoy a good dinner and chill on a week- night, this is the place to be! (
4
The manager, Jonalyn is really attentive and good for recommending wine. She's chirpy and very friendly~ It was great chatting to her. She's definitely an asset (
4
Love this place w friendly staff and nice ambience. Always come here for date nights.Great for my kids as well.. Shld try the tenderloin.. Really good.

5
Food was reasonably priced, great value for money. Would return, had a great atmosphere to dine in, enjoyed my meal!

The food and service is very good. We liked the Gambas, chorizo fettuccine and had a nice wine suggested by the staff - a lovely Pinot noir.
5
Good ambience for catching up with friends. Reasonable price . Will return again, good place to relax and spend a quiet afernoon.
4
The ambience is good and the service is prompt! The desserts are nice! We like the attentive staff who will check with us every now and then about the food and the service
4
Good customer service. Staff are very welcoming. Food are presented very nice and taste good. We like the sweet wine that the staff suggested to us. About atmosphere it's dark and think need to improve the lightings
5
Cosy hangout place in the west, friendly staff and great recommendation for food pairing. Ideal for family and friends gathering. Nice retail area to pick up wine for dine in and to g
4
The food was astonishing and the service was impressive but the lava cake did not have any "lava" flowing which was a let down for m
5
Atmosphere is v soothing n the food here is great . Also have great services n I would totally recommend this to my friend
5
It located inside a shoping center, but still very classy. We ordered the tuna steak and the sirlion steak, both delicious and good for the eyes as well. The wine prices are really ok, not so common in singapore. It worth the MRT ride if needed
5
I had brought my parents here for dinner. The food is good. The wine is good. Prices are reasonable. Definetly will come back again.
5
Good service and tasty food! Clean restaurant and the wine list is also extensive but not too much.
Will definitely come back.
5
Good ambiance, very attentive staff and the set lunch we had was very value for money. Will be back!
5
The staffs are really well trained, they know their product too well. And the wine are good. Especially the food are good.
5
Spent my birthday night here with a friend and love it! plenty of wine with good price (highly recommend their sparkling wines);
Besides they have good cheeses; nice staffs and decoration is very cool!
5
Pleasant experience at this place, waiters are polite and fast, very attentive. The prices are very affordable as well, great place to hang out with a group of friends over wine and cheese. Love their cheese platter and the affordability. The wine list is quite extensive too, highly recommended!!! Would definitely return for sure!
5
Visited this place a couple of times. The food and service is always top-notch. Even when the place gets really packed, the staff here will always try their best to give their full attention to diners.The ambience is very cosy; it feels just like home. Also, there is a wide selection of wine and quality food. Price is pretty reasonable as well. The restaurant's manager, Sue, always gives off a genuine and sincere vibe. Suitable for corporate or family gatherings
4
Value for money set lunch and very quiet and conducive setting for a quiet lunch with my friend. Laid back atmosphere and they also served a very mean chocolate lava cake :
5
Excellent ambience with great food and affordable pricing for everyone from all walks of life. The selection and quality is fantastic. I will strongly recommend this place to anyone looking to get the best for less
5
Came here with some friends. For the amount that we paid we had a truly great experience. Service was really good with servers giving great advice on selection of wines. We had a chorizo pizza which is great value for money. The place is very comfortable with very relaxing music. 5/5 for all
5
Decently priced good food with good wine. Comes with coupon with free wine. Set meal was pretty cheap and 2 courses .
5
It is pretty good for me and my friends. I am ready happy to have free wine with $20 expensing. Sure come back soon...cheers
5
Had a good time here with the drinks & food. It is now promo time, get free 1 glass redemption, which is a good deal.
4
the food was really good. It's a nice place for not only family's but also friends. The staffs here are also very friendly. The atmosphere is lively and it is definitely a children friendly place. Price is also worthy. Really satisfied and pleased.:)
4
Hard to complain about anything esp when you get a glass of wine with a meal over $20 !service is great and food (pasta) is affordable at $15Many shops in Hillv have gone and some shops empty but this will stay for sure on its own merit vis food, service, ease of parking and transport here.
4
Food was excellent along with good service albeit delayed at times likely due to the shortage of manpower
4
Overall it was a good first experience and I would come back if given the chance to. The restaurant had a nice comfortable ambience with friendly and patient staff. There was a plethora of options on the menu for both food and drinks. The food was promptly served and it was satisfying
5
Awesome, the food here is great, I usually have the tenderloin with blue cheese(it's warm and doesn't stink for people who dislike the smell) the ambience is wonderful, it's cosy, the lighting is not too dim, not too bright, and the service is extremely considerate. Besides that, the steak is so affordable
5
This place has a great varieties of wine and the price is reasonable. A bottle can be only around $30. Moreover, there is a promotion going on now and that is, with a minimum spending of $20, you get a free drink!A special mention to the staff, Ashley, for her friendly service and ensuring that our dinner went well. Overall, I would recommend this place for a nice dinner over wine. I will be back again
5
I went to dine in because it was recommended by my friend. They have wide variety of affordable wines, the cheapest one i've seen is $30 for dine in but they also have a retail shop wherein they offer some of the wines on promotion. The food was value for money, the ambience is cozy, the service was great. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We want to thank Jonalyn for taking care of our table. Will be back again
3
The atmosphere is very modern and eye pleasing. Good service and staff. If there was one negative point to make it would be the pricing of the food
5
Service, quality, price simply can't be beaten! Service, quality, price simply can't be beaten! Service, quality, price simply can't be beaten!

Service was fast and good, food was also delicious! Really would recommend visiting if you like Western food (:
5
Lovely ambience and really nice service! My husband really likes the food :D I recommend this place to others
5
The service was great, very fast. The food is also delicious. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends
4
Came here for lunch on Monday and ordered the lunch set course which comes with main course, appetiser and coffee/tea. Staff are polite and service is great. Good ambience.
5
Wine Connection at Hillview is a great place to visit and relax. My husband and I really like the atmosphere. The staff are so pleasant and our order was served promptly. It was an extraordinary experience for both of us. Good job and keep it up Wine Connection
1
Too mediocre but although service n food n wine n price ok. Really boring. If i am a visitor in singapore. Just go to any coffee shop...order a cold beer n have an order of salted egg yolk calamari n sweet sour pork...or fried noodles etc...Cheaper n 100pct more memorable
3
Food is not too bad. If you just want a nice ambience with reasonably ok food and wine in this vicinity, this is the place for you. Service is not great though. When I asked them to recommend a bottle of wine, they were quite "reluctant" to provide such a recommendation.
5
The whole restaurant set itself with a romantic atmosphere, having all those lighting and decorations. The staff gave an excellent recommendation of the wine and foods. They provided a good insight on the weekends wine tasting. They all are friendly and helpful. I would definitely revisit this place in the future and would sincerely recommend this wonderful place to all my family and friends
5
The place has a very nice ambience, quick service, value for money and tasty food. Would recommend it
5
We are regular patrons at this restaurant. They have a wide variety of wine at very reasonable prices. They are very serious about their food too. The tenderloin with blue cheese sauce is heavenly.
4
Nice place for lunch or dinner.
Good collection of wine at reasonable price.
Good food -- especially the prawn dish.
White beer is excellent.
Good Service.
Highly Recommended.
4
Good place to catch up with friends over some nice wines. Ambience is wonderful, service is great. Parking is easy.
4
Attentive service, good food at reasonable prices. The lunch menu was varied and had several options for sides.
5
Had my mother's birthday celebration here. We usually come to this place as it has a wonderfully relaxing ambience, especially at the back where there is privacy behind a screen, and full-length windows. The service has always been great, but tonight it was exceptional -- our wine glasses were always full, the food was lovely, and we had a good time talking and laughing without having to think about topping up wine/water or when the food was going to arrive. The staff is very courteous and attentive. Will strongly recommend for anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing place for dinner and conversation. Go for the grilled salmon fillet for melt-in-your-mouth quality, or the spicy crab fettucine for unparalleled freshness
3
There are many other better restaurants for the money in Singapore. The staff that day couldn't seem to understand that we wanted our meals served together so that we could eat together. Instead it seemed to be fine to serve one meal and then the other 20 minuets late
3
I am surprised that this restaurant is ranked number 4 in Singapore. I have eaten here 3 times out of convenience, and I think that the food is just average. I had the pizza, pasta, etc and sorry to say that I think I can cook better pasta. However the place is comfortable and the service is good and it closes at 12 midnight on weekends so if you need to eat at that time it is still worth going
3
I ordered a sausage dish which was ok. I asked for some mustard dip but was told that they will charge $2 for it.Spent about $400 with 2 bottles of wine for 4 persons and they only care about the extra $2.Strange. Never been back there since
3
Went there a few times with family and friends. The food was really average, but we loved the selection of wine. Diners can go to select their own wine at the shop adjacent to the bistro and drink there. The ambiance was good and the service was not bad at all. So go for the wine and lower your expectation for the food and you will enjoy your time there
4
Sirloin steak was well cooked. Pizza was thin and crispy on the side. Attentive and polite staff were a plus point. Will come back again.
4
Came here w family for dinner, food and services are just fantastic!! Will list this restaurant into our dinner must go list!
4
The beef Serling with red wine sauce was incredible. Kudos to the staff's recommendation. Will definitely come back for it again.
4
Good quality and portion size for set meal. Good and prompt service. Nice environment. Highly recommended for lunch.
3
Happy dinning good environment n friendly staff. Food tasty n waiting time is short. This survey is too Long as it should not restricted to 100 characters.........

A great hangout for the weekend dinner getaway with a group of friends . Had many bottles of wine. Excellent food and service by the staffs .
5
We enjoy our dinner very much. We are having a birthday celebration with our friend and the staff are very attentive to our needs. After dinner, the cake was brought out without us asking for it. Thank you for the great dining experience.
5
My 3rd visit to this restaurant. Cannot ask for more.. This place serves quality food in a nice, cozy ambience and more importantly, service is unprententious and friendly. A good place to meet friends, celebrate occasions, or just relax with a drink.
4
I had the Spanish Paella, and while the flavours could have been
Heavier, it was still delightful. Good wine recommendation. Gracious smiles from the serving staff. Not much to say about the hostess, though.
5
A great Bristro with a huge selection of wines, delightful range of delicious food and a wonderful crew to boot.
Whenever I need a relatively inexpensive meal, or just chill over a fine wine, I'll head to Wine Connection!
5
Overall, the staff are quite good especially 15 minutes of walk under the hot sun. The first thing they served us with ice water :) They are also quite attentive to the need of the customers and explaining the food detail to the customers. The whole restaurant is really quite cosy and comfortable for friends to catch up
5
We enjoyed the food very much. We were a group of six people and all of us had great food and the wine was excellent. Especially the chocolate lava cake was very delicious. There was a relaxed atmosphere, the restaurant design is very stylish and the staff is friendly too. We highly recommend "wine connection"
4
Was pleasantly surprised with the reasonable prices for food and wine for food and wine we had and the quality of service we received . Neither was there compromise in anyway for the ambience and experience. Special shout out to Ashley who made our night a comfortable one
5
The food was amazing and the service (we were served by Rachel) was excellent! She had great product knowledge, gave us good recommendations patiently and made our dining experience so lovely! (:
5
I think this branch is a lot better than the mud. Sultan one. The atm is much better and the food tastier
5
Not bad. I like very much . We all family like it.
Chicken menu is the best for us. Other menu also very good.
4
Cosy ambience. Food pricing is reasonable. A vararities of food menus, from Pasta, Pizza, Spanish food, Western delights. Service quite friendly !
5
A very cool ambient and good variety of food and wines to order from.Food is excellent and worth the value.
5
Food and drinks at affordable prices.
Servers are attentive and very helpful in recommending wines.
Relatively easy to get a table during dinner time.
5
Can't find anywhere with cheaper bottle of wines ($30+ onwards per bottle), with good dining western meals. Tried the Steak and Pork ribs, which are tender and good.
5
Superb dining experience that won't hurt the wallet. The pasta and the pizzas are well prepared. the wine prices are considerably cheaper than all other restaurants I have been to.
2
I dine with my uncle around 5-6pm.. its not busy at all at that moment. Chef was teaching the staff preparing food. It's opened kitchen where u can see through. Our food was prepared by a new boy where the chef standing beside him and guiding him along. Unfortunately our food just a disaster. It's was my first and last visit since then. My steak was tasteless and asked for medium where come out well done. Taste badly. I just can't finished it and staff never turn up and ask why as well. Hardly find staffs attention at all too. Busy chatting among themselves. Hardly get someone to attend to us. No one telling us promotion going on as well until I found out myself where it's too late as I have ordered similar items at higher price .
4
My family visited this place for a birthday celebration. Good was really good and service was excellent. As the restaurant is located in HillV2, it isn't as crowded as most restaurants that are comparable to this. Awesome place for a small cosy gathering if this is what you are looking for
5
The spaghetti here is very delicious.:) also pizza is delicious . The price is really worth it for the food. For the people who likes spaghetti you should really come here.
3
I can not consider this place as a good restaurant, the good restaurants are different, certainly for a glass of wine and an appetizer can be a pleasant place in the company..
5
Came a couple of times and yet to review. This time came with my Wife and Mum. Great selection of Food and wines. Services were good and can be better if waiver off the cost for addition sauces.
5
Service was great. Food was good. Good prices and location was suited. Noise and music was good volume and music was suited to the time. Siti was the name of our waitress and she was wonderful
5
The pasta was good. Ambience perfect. Thin crust pizza.. A rare gem in Singapore. Excellent service!
4
Gambas prawn's a must try! Generous amounts given for the pasta selections, and really well done thin crust pizzas for the price. Service was great, chill and relaxed ambience. Try it!
5
The staff are very friendly & attentive to our request. The place of the restaurant is cozy & a great place for gatherings.
5
We had a great time at the Hillview branch. The ambience was casual but not too rowdy. Food was good with attentive service. It turned out even better than the Katong branch which is much noisier. We will be back!
5
My friend took me there on the Friday night for dinner. I was very impressed by the menu and the prices were very reasonable. Next night I tried to find it with my hubby. By having standout t-shirts we came across 2 of the staff. Hence we ate there agai
5
The ambience is very relaxing and all the staff are nice. It's our first time here and we came here only to drink wine. We did not expect that the food is also great! Definitely recommended for a date or a night out with friends :
5
Your service is great very nice view and the food is really yummy and you have nice music.
Wine list is very comprehensive and we really enjoyed the Pinot noir
5

Have been here a few times for lunch. Very good set lunch price and the a la carte menu is good too. Good wine selection. Will be back!

5
The food and service here is very impressive. My Italian friends like the food. The service is very considerate. We will come again and again definitely,

Overcharged corkage, limited selection and staff who seems uninterested in serving unless you buy an expensive wine.
4
A good range of food and wine at affordable prices.Nice Ambience.Service is good,very friendly staff.Will definitely go back again.
5
We had 4 set lunches shared between 4 of us and we're extremely filled. The pizzas had really thin crusts that brought out the Flavours well. Pasta was ok, and the sea bass was fresh and well cooked. The desserts were generously served and excellent. Of course, not forgetting the wine. Th bottle of white we had was good and reasonably priced. Overall, a great place for a meal, especially during a weekday lunch
5
The atmosphere is nice and posh. Great caring staff. Food was okay. However at the environment makes it better. So overall a good experience.
5
Nice experience having lunch here, there was a special for lunches.Five of us are their lunch special and i t came with soup. Not a large crowd for lunch too so it enables you to be able to talk.

5
The atmosphere is great, the food is value for money and the service was excellent! Definite come back
4
I am impressed by the service of the staff. This was my second time back, the first being a few months before. What was impressive was the service staff recognised and remembered me and my friends. What really bowled me over was that the staff even remembered the wine we ordered previously!Reasonably priced food and drinks at a nice quiet part of Singapore
4
We went out for a casual family lunch. The restaurant had a nice welcome feel and from the beginning to the end the service was great. We ordered Gambas followed by Chorizo Fettuccine, Spinach Ravioli and Ribs. The pasta was very good and flavorful and were the best of the lot. The Gambas and Ribs were good, but not the best. I would go back to try other dishes. Overall, very nice experienc
4
Reasonably priced with great service quality. Staff were attentive to our table; filling up our drinks and asking for feedback. It's our first time here but probably not our last.

5
The Food was great and the service was excellent. Quick and fast. Will definitely come back with my family.
5
A birthday treat for my husband tonight. He started with the prawn gambas and that's all he talked about - the freshness and the succulence. Sea bass for mains and finished with chocolate lava cake. When I made the booking I advised the staff it is my husband's birthday today. He got a candle on his lava cake with a personalized happy birthday song!! Such attention to details!! We are most impressed with the service and how quick the food was served. No waiting for long. Good recommendation for the red wine too. Portion excellent - quality over quantity
4
Was a very enjoyable dinner experience. Had a Long day at work and was extremely hungry so just intended to head into a quiet bistro for an early dinner. Food was served fast and service rendered by Malcolm was great yet with a hint of privacy
5
We had the Parma and mozeralla cheese salad, spicy crab fettuccine and chargrill beef! The food is reasonably priced and the ambience is great for chat up with friends! Service crew was friendly! Enjoyed the night here!

4
I visited Wine Connection Bistro located at HillV2 Shopping Mall as i frequently visit the one in Bangkok at K-Village. The Food and Wine is similar to the one in Bangkok but slightly more expensive and the staff are not as attentive as the one in Bangkok
4
After a super tired week, we decided to chill at wine hillv2, our current favorite special spot. I ordered something different, one I haven't tasted before and I was surprised on its serving size and presentation. Indeed, they never failed to amaze me. But most special is how the staff remembered us every time we pay a visit, even remembering where we last seated. They will always ask how's the food and how are you. These simple gestures really makes me a satisfied and coming back customer
5
Nice foods And good ambience. Service was excellence. The apple crumble dessert is fantastically good. There is a wide range of wine selection at great prices.
4
There was an interesting blend with the different European dining experiences. The service is excellent ! Staff is friendly esp Jonalyn service is friendly and good ! Came few times and will come back again.

The better timing was during the weekend.

5
Fantastic meal, value for money and Super attentive service.
Staff are always on hand to attend to request n queries. Drinks are topped up without asking. Knowledge staff.

Visited the HillV2 Bistro, after I was charmed by the Tapas Bistro at Robertson Walk. The place was much more quiet, still the food and the wines were at the same high level and very friendly prices. Good place.

I recommend eating here so you should eat here since I ate here and then definitely eat the tomato and mozzarella when you eat here on days you are planning to eat here or whenever you feel like eating.
5
This girl s my 3rd time at this chain of Wine conection. I like the ambience, food and service. There's plenty to f options and even some vegetarian choices. They are accommodating too of some food requests and changes. If I want to have a relaxing lunch, dinner or drinks I head to this place. Good options for children. And nice portions. They also have great wine options at probably the most affordable prices in Singapore
5
There was minor internal miscommunication pertaining to our reservation, nonetheless, they had managed to recover it quickly and we were fortunate enough to have Johann to take care of our table that evening. We have enjoyed the red wine & reiseling wine recommended by Johanna and food have turned up to be amazing..would certainly back as long as such wonderful staff are around.
5
The food was Nice and good food,. The restaurant was cosy with nice ambient. The services was good. We enjoy the lunch.

We come here often and the service is really good, the staff are really friendly. The waiting time is quite reasonable and doesn't take too long to serve our orders. The food is really good and worth it for such a price, I wouldn't mind paying more to dine here
5
The food here is generally above average, but the ambience is great. I'd recommend this to people who just need to unwind after work with some food and wine. The best part of this place would be the service. Staff here are unfailingly warm and welcoming
5
You won't regret coming here. The wine is value for money there is a wide selection for the food. The take way price for wine is unbelievable !

My family had the set lunch here today and it was really good and we find that value for money. This is the 4th time I come for their set lunch and I've been here twice for dinner. The ambience is very nice and the service team is very polite and helpful. My children liked it here. Usually I like to sit by the window and look out at the greenery and watch cars pass by. The food is good, pizza size generous for sharing and steak nicely done. Herb butter and garlic butter are our fav
5
Our first visit to the outlet, very good food and wine list. Surprisingly affordable on the price tag of the bottles, nice warm service of staffs. Recommended to all for a quiet night away from the buzzing city. My choice of dining for a place close to home
5
Was good, cheap food, nice menu. We really enjoyed ourselves and had a lovely evening with the family
5
Order the lamb cutlet and couscous, very nice flavours and food. Highly recommend to drink and chill.
5
The service was great and attentive. Very good for family and casual dining. Would definitely come again.

4
Nice pizza. I love the food here because they are tasty. You should try the meat here too. Equally as good. The wine here is priced reasonably. A good place to recommend to all to Chill and talk.
5
Friendly staff,very approachable. Good food for affordable prices, hope the quality of food and prices maintain.
4
This is a very pleasant bar/restaurant with good food and knowledgeable, attentive service staff. We are frequent visitors to Singapore and have dined at Wine Connection twice before with our Singapore friends. Previous visits have been similar to this in the quality of food, service and wine, where the wine list is extensive and reasonably priced for Singapore. What differed this time was the poor delivery of the meals where two ladies who ordered a simple pasta dish did not receive their food until the men had finished their meals of steak and duck, thereby taking away some of the fellowship of the food and wine. Unfortunately the same poor timing was repeated when coffee was ordered - two arrived followed by a long wait for the second two drinks. Otherwise the service was of a high standard - knowledgable but unobtrusive and the food was very good. While we were not happy with the disjointed evening meal we will continue to visit Wine Connection for the atmosphere and the food
4
We went here for lunch because it was located very conveniently, nearby our house. It was great! We ordered the lamb cutlet and the BBQ pork ribs. The lamb was great, and the potato wedges that came with it were crispy and yummy, just how I like it. The pork ribs were also tasty, though I wouldn't have minded some more sauce, and the beer was good too. So overall, we had a great meal there
5
Had a tenderloin rare and it was fantastic. At similar price to other restaurant, the food and service here were unparalleled. Definitely will come back. Only thing was that they tend to end a bit early perhaps due to the residential zone nearby.
5
Staff are wonderfully attentive, food was delicious and the wine list both volumous and affordable. Highly recommend
5
Enjoyed the experience. Service was prompt and the food was great. Paella and the pork ribs are a must have.
5
Restaurant opposite my place. Weekend family dining place. Paella and steaks are must try. Fresh pasta for the kids. Crab bisque with bread stick for starter.
5
Really enjoyed the experience especially the friendly staff who never seem to fail to exceed our expectations. Not forgetting the excellent food
5
The ambience of the restaurant is very good. It is ideal for having a relaxing lunch with families and friends. The service from the waiter/waitress were attentive as well. The quality of the food is excellent too. We liked the sea bass and steak. They are delicious and nicely done. The dessert, Apple crumble is a winner and definitely worth a second helping. Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience
4
The Wine Connection by far was what I found to be the most wide variety at a very reasonable price for wines of all regions globally. The food was very good and the staff a pleasure. However my very favorite evening was picking a great wine then heading to their Cheese room for a most enjoyable tasting of cheeses of every kind!!!Thanks for some great tasting evenings..Best regards,Bruce Winte
4
A pretty good option for late night dining for couples or family. Obviously the wine collection is pretty good and the food not bad either (though I thought the lamb shank was a shade better at starker situated right below !). The starters were ok, though the mains and desert were very good. We ordered pizza and lamb shank. The chocolate lava cake and the tiramisu were a nice way to round things staff . Staff is nice and helpful generally . Try and get the street facing tables at the end of the restaurant

The ambience is great for a chill out session with friends. Enjoying some wine with cheese & cold cut platter for the weekend. If you need to have dinner or a meal, you do not have to worry there are whole list of choices for you to choose from

Ordered 2 medium rare steaks. 1 came out well done on the left side of the meat while the right side of the meat was medium rare. The other steak was totally well done! Sent the steaks back to the kitchen and was told by the service staff that the Chef maintained that the steaks were medium rare. Surprised with the Chef's poor standardsThe fish and chips ordered was salty. Verdict - not returning until I hear that they have improved their standard

The food is good, service was excellent at extremely affordable prices. Highly recommend coming to try out.

The service is excellent, they were very willing to offer help. And it can be evident that the cooks had put a lot of effort in making our food. :)
5
We have a wonderful evening and enjoy it. Furthermore, the price of the food is fairly reasonable and it tastes wonderful!
5
Good variety of food, good wine selection. Good presentation of food.
We will come again. Good atmosphere & can talk. Reasonably priced.

Nice ambience, soothing music! Food was great and the staff were really friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended!

A good place to have a good meal in Singapore. Good food, Nice ambience and Friendly staff. It is not difficult to find this place. The variety of food are plentiful. Its dessert spread is must to sample likewise for its appetiser.

Great food, ferric service. Bistro style, very relaxed. Highly recommend. Great choices for vegetarians. Excellent reasonably priced wine list.

In August my husband and I went out for dinner at Wine Connection HillV2. We ordered a seafood paella which had mussels on the half-shell in it. The mussels weren't washed properly, and when I bit into one, I crunched down hard on a pebble. The pain was immediate and excruciating! I ended up fracturing my tooth down to the root and it had to be extracted. This "nice evening out" with my hubby will end up costing me a fortune in dentist's fees as I will have to get an implant which involves paying for multiple consultations, scans, and possible bone grafting so the titanium screws they put in will hold the implant in place. The food preparation I experienced is not up to standard--I would have not ended up losing my tooth had the shellfish been adequately rinsed prior to serving them to me to eat. AVOID AT ALL COSTS
4
The food was pretty good especially at the price. It's a good place to visit for casual dinning. The staff was really friendly and service was really smooth. Interesting beer selection for those who don't want the usual beers like tiger, Carlsberg and Heineken. Great place

I used to look at reviews of top places and wondered how there can possibly exist such a huge disparity between 99.99% of guests who have enjoyed a marvelous experience, and the 0.01% who had a totally opposite experience. After visiting this outlet, I too found myself as part of the anomaly. The Wine Connection brand has always provided a wide selection of affordable wines. Prices at this outlet were equally reasonable no doubt, but the food was definitely nothing to shout out about (the pasta was overcooked - and definitely not fresh pasta, the fish was too mushy), and the service was subpar at best. "Sparkling or still?" we were asked by the MaÃ®tre d' upon taking our seats. "Tap water please" was our reply..... which never arrived until we prompted a 2nd waiter. Fine, benefit of a doubt - perhaps they were understaffed. However, as the meal went on and we were prompted with more questions (which, for the record, is perfectly fine): "Any appetizers for you?" "2nd glass of wine?" "Any dessert?", I guess the waiter grew tired of taking "no" for an answer, as her smile would immediately disappear and she would just turn around and walk away without saying anything else the moment we said "no thanks". I don't know - did I order the wrong dishes? Perhaps it was an extremely busy dinner service? Perhaps I was not a big enough spender to warrant decent service? At any other dime a dozen cafe all this would have been excusable, but for a restaurant that is 3rd on TA? Unbelievable. TA has always been a very reliable source for me but I wonder what went wrong this time..

Great ambience for people hoping to catch up, talk and not have to deal with a flood of people jostling. Serving staff was friendly. The food portion was just right and the menu had everything for everyone.
5
Great service...attentive. Had the lamb shank n grilled salmon. Delicious...the Creme brûlée was smooth ... Nice.
5
Fantastic mains , fresh starters a great dining experience for our family of 8 including 2 young kids . Kids will love the pizzas on offer here . definitely a place to return to
4
Food was great quality and was served 'bistro' style, meaning served as soon as possible. The wine that was recommended was very good and we enjoyed the overall experience. Definitely would visit again!

Had a enjoyable meal at wine connection HV2, great service and above average food. Always good quality.

Service was good! Rachel was very efficient, helped us with our requests. Yay!!!! Thank you very much!

Wine connection is our alternative to cooking at home as it is close by. Food is delicious and the standard of service and the quality of food has been maintained since day one.
5
Steak is very well done with awesome choices of sauces to go with. But the pork ribs can be improved. Desserts was very nicely done as well. A very good place for all occasions .
5
You might think it is a normal bistro with normal services when you first set foot in the establishment. However, the moment the staff attends to you, you will feel like royalty. The food greets you with an ever surprising myriad of flavours which proves the chef's culinary ability as the blend of texture and taste takes you ever higher in your experience here. The vast selection of wines from all over the globe allows you to experience the world right at your table. It is really an experience not to be missed
5
The food was amazing and of high quality, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is relatively high class. The service was good as well and the waiters were very friendly and helpful when we had doubts about the various foods on the menu, and also gave good suggestions on the wine we should order. Overall I think it's a good place to celebrate special occasions as it provides an amazing atmosphere with good food at good value

Good food and good service. My boy likes the pork ribs and lava cake. The place has good ambience !.
5

As I live close by to HillV2, I have visited this branch quite the a couple of times and have never been disappointed with the service rendered! Kudos the mother stvice team here!
5
We celebrated my husband's birthday here. The staff was great! The service was quick and very helpful. We loved the cheese and meat board- great choices. So many choices of wine! The manager helped me pick out an Argentinian wine that was awesome. Great place to celebrate his birthday! Thank you Wine Connection! Prices were great too.
5
Thrilled to have a Wine connection restaurant/retail near home. This bistro is chic and offers familiar comfort menu. What sets them apart is the excellent service that they give. Know what we always order which is great attention to details that is very important in this industry. The retail shop completes the 'Wine Connection' experience. Would return here again because you can never really go wrong
3
Atmosphere is good and the wine selection is great. The prices were ok but you must factor in the cost of the corkage when having the wine there. If you are not ordering meals, it is probably better to bring the bottles home. The food is norma
3
Came to have a some drinks with friends to catch up. What was supposed to be a chill out session left a bad taste in our mouths. We initially choose a bottle of wine from their selection of displays. We then sat down and started drinking. Only after our first glass, we were told that the initial price was for retail and there was a large corkage charge associated with sitting in. We wouldn't have minded so much if we were told at the beginning. But considering that there were only 1 or 2 tables, there is really no reason to let this slip.However, after we complained, they did offer to comp the charges and charge the original quoted price
5
Wine connection bistro at hillv2 serves set lunches that has great value. For $18+, we had a Caesar salad, a slice of perfectly cooked beef sirloin and coffee. Food is of extremely high standard. Service was also excellent. Apparently they have a new chef. Our steaks were done much better than our previous visits
5
Good service with friendly staff.
Staff is knowledgeable on the types of food offered in the restaurant.
Ambiance is relaxing.

Loved the soup and wine. Ravioli was a bit bland. The waiter was friendly and service was fast.......

There is also a great selection of wine provided.I greatly enjoyed dining at the Wine Connection Bistro - HillV2 and I highly recommend dining at this restaurant
5
So good to see our favourite waiter promoted! And the food seems to be getting even better (of course, the wine is always amazing). Tonight we were celebrating our kids' athletics achievements and the meals were perfect, particularly the salmon fillet. Service was awesome as usual and value exceptional.
4
The service here is pretty good. They are quite attentive and friendly. Food is good as well. Love the Spanish style Gambas and the fettuccine is not bad either. Place is pretty crowded so expect lots of noise and ppl talking loudly as tables are very near each other. If you find this rating useful, please click on the helpful butto

5
Very friendly and helpful staff. Very good selection of wines. Prices are very decent and the food is splendid! If you haven't been here, it's high time. Set in a lovely Neighbourhood not the west of Singapore. No hustle and bustle of the city yet service u get here is what you would from a more upscale place like Dempsey. This has been my weekly go to place after work on Fridays as I will know that I will not be disappointed after a hard day's work. Lovely place!*p.s please call In advance in case there is no available table

Food is delicious, friendly staff. Good selection of wine. The Spanish style Gambas is our Favourite 😀
4
My Wife and I had a very good dinner in this restaurant with a nice ambience. The Greek salad was crispy and fresh, the paella abundant and tasty and so was the lamb cutlets cooked to perfection. The suggested wine was matching perfectly. The Apple crumble with vanilla ice cream was awesome to finish this delicious meal. We come back
4
This place is in a great spot called Robertson Quay. It's has many restaurants and shops to chose from. We met a coworker here for drinks and appetizers. Nice food, service & drinks. We sat on the outdoor patio and people watched.
4
Excellent menu with a decent selection of wines. Not all staffs were familiar with wines, but can get by. In particular Johann did a great job to ensure a good evening. I feel it's good value.
5
Excellent ambience with attentive staff, great menu and wine list, reasonably priced. Always a pleasure coming back here
5
Food and wine are great, prices are reasonable. Staff are friendly.
Will go back often.
Though no carpark lots, valet service now available.
4
The service was fast n efficient. Friendly staff make ambience fewl good. Food was okay. I would recommend this place not only 2 nearby resudents but also to those staying further.
4
Good ambience, very good service attitude! The pizza is fantastic, goes perfectly with the wine. Wine is good as well, if you choose according to your preference. Just one downside though, a bit disappointed with the Spanish Paella, I had eaten before previously and it was awesome, but this time the rice was quite wet, and the whole dish wasn't as fragrant as before. But overall the service attitude is good! We requested for a change of seat and the service staff accomodate our request with graciousness. Had a good meal and experience
5
We now consider ourselves regulars to Wine Connection HillV2. The food is outstanding, reasonably priced and the service is first class. We arrived in Singapore 3 months ago and eat out regularly. We consider Wine Connection to be one of the best eateries for food and wine quality, price and customer service. I would recommend anyone to visit Wine Connection HillV2
3
Had a "Surf & Turf Platter for 2". Surprised that we couldn't have our fish & meat done differently. Salmon was pretty decent; meat was a little too cooked for my liking as we had to ask for medium done-ness for both.Pretty decent service from all staff though - service w/a smile, eye for details, makes one feels welcomed. Atmosphere nice, especially seats by the window. Good for a slow relaxed meal
4
We are a bunch of normal and early retirees. We host fellowship to keep in touch.A friend recommended this outlet. Though initially thought to be 'far', the Downtown Line has made it very accessible.There was a big variety of wine to choose from and at a 'decent' price unlike many other joints. Food was good and the service was excellent which suggest that we shall make a return visit
5
This is our favourite restaurant and couple-time hangout! When we bring our girls, they always enjoy their food here. Whenever we want to have couple time to enjoy wines, this is the place on top of our list. We could trust the experienced manager, Ms Su's choice of wine to go with our dinner. I must also compliment all the friendly and hardworking staffs. The waiters and waitresses make it a point to remember what wine you like and recommend other nice wines. Strongly recommended.
4
Good facilities and services. Nice food that suit my taste. Quite place no disturbance that you can enjoy your meal.
5
Great restaurant...great atmosphere...very friendly staff make you feel at home. Pasta dishes are a must - and very good selection of wines

5
Great Lunch. Taken there by some potential customers and not disappointed. Great service, very good price, great wine selection and food was delivered within reason. Quality was very, very good.
5
A place that'll always be on the top of my list for pairing of wine and food with friendly and attentive service. Great value and selection of wines from all over the world. - David L.

a rare gem in a quiet neigborhood. some place you wanna keep it as it is and nice, quiet please to chill on weekend afternoons. Shhh.... don't tell anyone!
5
Great food great restaurant highly recommended!!!! Friendly and attentive staff that are very helpful!!!! If you're around the area come down to wine connection!
5
Came back after a month. This tie went for the cheese platter accompanied by a German beer and a Italian rose for starter. Fantastic cheese platter. Then had a lamb shank and it is one of the nicest I ever had. Wife has a pesto. Great food, soothing ambience and felt very relaxing.
5
I am lucky to be in the neighbourhood and a frequent visitor. I love the selection of individual glasses of wine. Normally a restaurant gives few options. Salads are amazing and varied. Desserts are great for the price. As a seafood guy, I appreciate all the entree options and smaller portions of seafood. The Spanish style grilled shrimps are great. After several visits they learn your name or at least your face. And it's professional, smiling service every time. Amazing team
5
Wine connection has always been a place of wonderful and really affordable food and great wine .The ambience is good too , the servers are very attentive unlike some restaurants where you have to even sometimes stand up to get a napkin or water , highly recommended for families too as they serve great pizza and pasta , not forgetting the lava cake which is really FANTASTIC !!A MUST DINE RESTAURANT 
5
Service is prompt and good. Has a wide spectrum of food in a menu that will cater to the different diet preferences. Enjoyed lunch sets at a reasonable price. Ambience is just nice for people to chat.
5
Good service . Friendly staff and good food. Wine also good.....Will be back again....reasonable price
4
It's a nice and new bistro in hill view . The menu selection is very comprehensive. The only flip side is that they ran out of some of the wines. The customer service was great too.
4
I had lunch with a former client at this restaurant which serves good Western food for the first time. The shopping mall is the latest in the Hillview area. Place is relatively quiet as it is located in residential area. Surprisingly this restaurant has a wide menu selections. Prices are very reasonable compared to other Bistros. Ambience is good and the tables not too close together. It also has a set with prices at S$18! We were served by a very amiable young man who was very helpful. Good for both business or social lunches and dinners. Will be back! 
5
It's not easy to find a restaurant in Singapore that provides great food and wine, excellent service, a pleasant ambience, and overall value for money. Wine Connection is one that does, and that's why we go back again and again! We usually order the platter of 3 different cuts of beef, which is always perfectly cooked to our liking! We also enjoy their thin-crust pizzas. And of course, their wines and draft beers. I must commend all the staff for their consistently high level of service. These guys and gals are kept very busy, but they are always smiling and very professional! Thank you, and needless to say, we'll be back soon
5
- Nice atmosphere away from the downtown hype. - Friendly and attentive service - Knowledgeable and fast staff - Wide range of quality wines at very competive prices, served at the right temperature - Great food selection fitting every budget from pizza to prime cuts - Check out their set-menus for lunch, served quickly at great price
5
Had dinner with a friend and enjoyed the ambience at the bistro. The prize of the food is reasonable and pretty good. Service is really good. The staff there are attentive. They are sensitive and always kept our wine glasses filled. There is a wide range of wine and at retail price. That's great for me because my friend and I love wine. I strongly recommend this bistro. Try it
4
When you look for value for money, this is the place to go! Nicely designed restaurant, friendly staff and delightful european dishes. Love the assorted platter.Good selection of affordable wines and also the coffee is great.We have been here for lunch but will surely come back for diner
5
We went to the fully-booked bistro on Valentine's Day. Although it was a last minute plan without reservation, we were seated very quickly in less than 5 minutes. Their service was impressive. Special thanks to the assistant manager Jonalyn, who served us exceptionally well. She was friendly, helpful and knows her products well. The fresh fettuccine with crab bisque was very tasty! Pizza was crunchy (thin crust) and huge. Both of us enjoyed the red wine recommended by Jonalyn. It was an Italian GSM blend wine. Very interesting! Can't wait to try the wide variety of wine they offer!Even though it was a full house, it wasn't very noisy and loud. Very comfortable place.Will definitely return
5
Wine Connection @ Hill V2, Its Cosy, its Homely and creates an atmosphere of such ease, adding to a relaxed dining experience. Almost feels private. My favourite Bistro compared to its other locations. You start your journey into the bistro with the warm greets and smiles from their staff. It is so Welcoming to have staff whom you can have a conversation with as well as without failing to bring out the best of moods from you. Wine connection presents you with a beautiful array of food and beverages. (Don't know your wines or what to have? Just ask their Staff who would be happy to help! In all i gotta thank (Mr Johann) With all my visits, This man has never failed to present me with the perfect customer service possible. He knows his people and how to attend to his customers needs and wants. You always make my visits to Wine Connection Bistro @ Hill V 2 even better. Thank you for making me feel at home Mr Johann and as long as you work at this bistro, ill be visiting more often
5
Delicious Paella to celebrate our early Valentines date. Staffs are nice and accommodating. Will definitely recommend and will come back again
5
Excellent service, pleasant ambience, value for money! The crew are sensitive to the needs of the customer, ambience is perfect for friends and family and of course the prices are justifiable.
5
Commendable service with attentive staff. They did a great job to recommend the wine and was friendly throughout our dinner. Environment is great and prices were reasonable too. Well done!
5
Living in this neighborhood, glad to find this place. Ambience is perfect, price is even better. What's more, wine to go with meals. Strongly recommended!
4
Chanced upon this decent hideaway, easy parking without the city crowds. They serve decent food and wine collection that is different from the rest of the wine connection places (expected it to be the same). They have a nice view from the second floor of the complex, hence nice view to chit chat. I am a fav of Malbec and they did not disappoint on the few occasions that I visited.One of my fav wine options to hang out.
4
We go to this restaurant almost every week. It's such good value that this doesn't break the bank! The food is fine, drink good value but the staff are outstanding. Very attentive and friendly. The food comes quickly which suits my kids, but a caution here: they freely admit food comes when it's ready ( so different people on a table get food at different times) which is OK when you get used to it, but one time my starter and my main course arrived simultaneously, which wasn't really acceptable. Pizzas are especially good. We prefer this to the branch at Robertson Quay
3
We have been here a couple of times. It's quite a laid back place for brunch and the wines are alsoquite good.We have also bought a number of bottles of wines at the front of the eatery, and the staff are quite knowledgeable about the various wines and can make some recommendations if you want to pair it with certain cuisines. They even have a return policy where you can send back any spoilt bottles within a couple of weeks
5
Its our first time to dine-in even though we just live nearby. As we are browsing the menu in front of the restaurant, Jonalyn welcomed us with a warm smile and greetings and introduce the menu and specials. The ambience is cozy. the food was great and they have a wide selections of wine that are value for money, thanks also Logesh for the great service! I recommend this restaurant at Hillview Mall
5
My 4th time here. Very nice service with quality food. Staff were extremely nice, food is delicious n reasonable price. Su was very nice to us and we enjoyed a great Sunday afternoon. I will be back and highly recommend to friends who like cheese n wine.Cheers
5
It's a great place to chill out with family/friends at anytime of the day. I've visited this place countless times over a year and still amazed by the service crew, one of the best I've met by far. Great food and wine at affordable prices. The staff are knowledgeable about the range of wine they offer as well. If you haven't visit this outlet yet, you should really give it a try soon. You'll be impressed by this hidden gem in the west. Thank you guys for being awesome all the time! :
5
The food was excellent. We had pizza with parma ham, cesrsr salad, tenderloin, new zeeland mussles and fettucine. Service was even better. Not to talk about the wine from Navarra.
5
It's a great place to hang out with friends. The food are great, service are great too. Will come back again to try other food :)
5
Food is nice, great service. Good spread if food and wines. Coffee is nice too. Many options for set meals and combos. You need to come and feel the nice service.
5
It's a comfort place , you will spend your lovely afternoon in there , especially food is good too , price is reasonable! Its a good place to go there !
5
Cozy and comfortable place to dine and wine! The menu is reasonably ranged though I hope there's pork knuckles and chicken wings too. Wine recommended by staff made our xmas eve's night! Staffs friendly and smiley! Great pricing for the wines!
5
Visited the restaurant again after some time (since my last review). It was again a very pleasant experience, with an excellent, friendly service. The quality of food was high and very affordable. It remains a restaurant for families, couples, business meetings. Will be returning soon!
4
Short walk from DTL2 Hill View Station- Convenient to get there. Good food, wine and service. Relax ambience. The staff provided excellence services. Were attentive and very patient with us! Overall, a great experience for me and my friend. Will come back again.Cheers! MK & C
5
Great place for relaxing weekend lunch. If you like tomatoes, you must try their tomato and mozzarella. They do serve up very decent steak, where the medium is cooked medium, not medium well. Compliments to the chef. Great selection of wine next door too. Could have someone more knowledgeable in wines to tend to the store.
5
I come here nearly every week with my family, after a dinner gathering with colleagues in mid 2015. I love the food and wine and brought my husband and daughter here and they fell in love with the place too!The place has great ambience with delicious food and wonderful wines. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My family and I feel very at home here.
4
My wife and me had our dinner here last Sunday. Staff were friendly and attentive. We ordered a starter dish of prawns in garlic oil. The prawns were fresh but personally there was too much oil in the container. My wife had a vegetarian pizza which was good. My main course of lamb cutlet was succulent. The glass of red wine recommended by the staff was very good. In total we paid S$75 which I think is reasonable. The bread basket costs S$2.80 which I think was unusually cheap. We will surely return soon for their Christmas set at S$59+ which includes dessert and coffee
5
I come here every once in awhile and the food always surprises me. The food, service,waiting time is so good I recommend this place to everyone
5
We come here every week to enjoy the food and very reasonably priced wine. The kids love it, service is excellent, great prices, fantastic selection of wine. Staff are really friendly and attentive. My son says 'very good desert and nice location'
4
Nice food , good wine and friendly , attentive staff. A little out of place but will be OK once the new MR line opens. Reasonable pricing
5
Great service, relaxing ambience and food is yummy !!! The wine tastes good at a very reasonably pricing too!!! Thumbs up !!
5
The food is really nice, service is good too. It is a high value for money, and an enjoyment to dine here. Been eating here many times with my family and will keep coming in the future :)
5
Excellent work from the service team (shoutout to Johann for taking care of us) who are evidently great at what they do.
Spot-on wine recommendation as well, would definitely visit again!
5
Having to talk about a wonderful place in the west. Wine connection HillV2 is your choice!! Look at the amazing choice of wines and delicious food at a very reasonable price !! Served by polite and capable waiters that are able suggest me the wine that suits my taste buds. Will return to this place very soon. Good job guys. Keep it up!! Will strongly recommend this place to people will love to drink wine

This was my 1st visit. Wont think of coming back again. $3 to change fm potatoe wedges to mashed potatoe. $2 for additional pepper sauce? I wonder how much they charge for additional sugar syrup
5
On a quiet rainy Saturday afternoon, my wife and I decided to check out this Bistro at Hillviewâ€™s new HILL V2 mall. Off the beaten track, relative to where we live and frequent, the ambience was lovely and pleasant. We indulged in an Assorted platter, a delectable Spanish prawn gambas, Chorizo fettuccine, and paired the delicious meal with an affordable bottle of Chateau Pontet Plaisance, a Saint-Emilion Grand Cru. To make our dining experience a memorable one, the service team was simply outstanding! Special thanks to Johann, Siti and Malcolm for taking care of our every need
5
Yesterday afternoon, my husband and I decided to head out to Wine Connection Bistro at HillV2 for a late lunch. The bistro was cozy and the food and wine were incredibly reasonably priced for the quality presented. Feasting on the delectable assorted platter, seaseme crusted tuna steak and Spanish style Gambas prawns - paired with a sublime bottle of Chenin Blanc - it took us back to our holidays in the wine country of Napa Valley. The icing on the cake was the amazing warmth and finesse shown by the excellent service crew of Sue, Johann and Malcolm. Thank you for an superb experience and little doubt that we will be back soon
5
The service is excellent. We had a good time. The food is decent and reasonably priced. Will come back again.

Food seem to be slightly on the salty side but service is good especially Zack is good at recommending wine pairing with the food with ordered. The F&B has improved compare when it first opened.

I really like the cheese platters but I'm not much of a wine drinker so I can't comment on their wine list. Still I do enjoy the experience everything we visit. Great service.
5
This branch is beautifully designed and staffed with a friendly, professional bunch. It is an oasis of delicious but simple fare in this part of the island - Upper Bukit Timah/Hillview. There's no rush like other places but a chilled atmosphere. Make yourself at home! The wine shop has a good variety of stuff to take home or to parties. Love it
4
The ambients is cool as air con is just right. Chairs are comfortable for the back and setup is spacious. Quality of foods : Appetizer Prawn sauce is superb. The salad is tasty and moist. Bread is crispy and freshly baked. Currently only have set lunch offer so It will be good to have set dinner for family friendly affordable meal. Service is prompt and friendly. You should come and try. M &

The awesome experience that keeps me coming back is the service that Logesh and Malcolm provides. If you have not met them, you should give them an opportunity.The wine recommendations are spot on when you are able to explain the type of wines you prefer. Wine Connection, please take good care of Logesh and Malcolm, whom are the reasons why I choose HillV2
5
Heard about this new Wine Connection outlet, but only found out where it was accidentally 2-3 months ago, but wow, we like it so much that we have gone back there so many times - twice just last week!The place is very cozy and as usual with the same good and reasonably-priced food and wine. If you have not been there, there's a whole range of nice below $35 wines, and great pastas and pizzas most for less than $15, not forgetting the variety of salads and main courses like paella rice, steaks, fish, etc. Maybe the only pricey item is the lamb cutlet :)We used to frequent the bistro at Robertson Walk's but since discovering HillV2's, its now our default dinning place when we are looking for a satisfying western meal.And service is super - prompt and delightful - the staff there even remember your name after a few visits. Its manager (Sue), Johann and Malcolm (to name a few) make you feel so welcome and good all the time.We always try to be there early, before 6.30pm, as the car park fills up quickly especially on weekends, Pity roadside parking is not allowed although a single instead of double yellow line could actually help. Nevertheless, we have queued up a few times for a parking lot, and its always worth the wait
3
Nice and quiet place to go during weekday lunchtimes. The set lunch is extremely good value. The normal menu is decently priced and the dishes are usually good. The location in HillV2 means that you are reasonably assured of a table during weekdays. During weekends, reservation is advised and parking can be a bit of a problem.
5
The Spanish Style Gambas is definitely a must to try! For the price it offers, the food is more than worth it as the ingredients used were fresh and of good quality. However, it is the staffs working here that makes the experience awesome and worth. The staffs were extremely friendly and helpful. They were polite and gave a five star customer service. I'm more than pleased and willing to return to Wine Connection at HillV2
5
The wine chateau louvie is a must for first timers, I love the gambas, the assorted platter is also a must. The food here is served until very late and it has a great ambience to the restaurant, the waiters here are very knowledgable, however it is far from the mrt, driving would be advised. This place is worth coming to
4
The beef was cooked well and exactly as instructed. The servers were friendly and approachable. I enjoyed the attentive service as well. thank you!
5
Favorite place with good food and good wine at affordable prices, and nice ambience. friendly and attentive staff too!
4
Not as good as the Robertson Walk, but a whole lot quieter. Nice to be able to have a conversation table.
4
Beyond a scintillating journey of wine and spirits, the food here was an amazing journey in itself. The night was capped off nicely with impeccable service by Malcolm and co.
Ps try the pizzas, you won't regret it
5
Staffs here are very friendly n service was great! Price of the food is reasonable. Love the interior.
5
Decent food with excellent service staffs. They never fail to check in with diners whether the food (and wine) were up to expectations.
5
Been to Wine Connection a few times with my family. The food is tasty and not too expensive. Service is like European style asking if you enjoy your food and taking care of your requests promptly.
5
Wine Connection Bistro is a nice and quiet restaurant outside the hustle and bustle of the main city. The staff is friendly, service quality and food is good. Of course, you'll have a great collection of wines to choose from. We visited with the family a few times and had a good experience. My mom is a vegetarian and even she had a decent choice of food items on the menu. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you want to relax, have a conversation along with nice food and wine ..
5
Hi GuysHope you all are well. We, the Steven's family, would like to extend a HUGE THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts for a job well done and excellent service!!! We havenâ€™t received such awesome service before. WELL DONE!!! The food was delicious & well worth our money. Ps: Especially to Jamie & Zack for making our day more lovely! THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR AWESOME SERVICE AND TAKING GOOD CARE OF US!!!!! I will refer you guys anytime :) WE ARE VERY VERY VERY VERY HAPPY!!! Kind RegardsSteven's Family 
4
A place with simple food with many variety of "alcohol" to select.I love the cava they have recommended, very reasonable and affordable price. They floor staff have good knowledge of beverages. We ordered mixed grilled sausages, mixed grilled platter, Caesar salad, wedges, pizza, and dessert to share among 6 of us. I like the ambience, not cram, not too noisy, at least I can hear when my friends speak..
3
Can be crowded in the evening and when I was there the service was kind of slow perhaps due to the crowd that the restaurant was experiencing then. Not a bad place to chill if you stay around there.
5
Atmosphere was good, service was fantastic, the food is delicious and of high quality but not too expensive. Desserts can be improved though.
5
Recommend good restaurant I will be back!
Very helpful staff - Jamie, Sue
Nice atmosphere. ............
5
We received stellar services from a waiter by the name of "Christopher" he was able to professionally recommend dishes that served our taste buds well. Food and service was top class. Will definitely be back
5
Brilliantly done. Not at all showy just functionally good. But they've thought of everything — even non-wobble tables.
5
Very nice setting with good food and very friendly staff. Overall - good value for money.
Good wine selection.
4
On a first visit dinner, the staff were polite and helpful, and the ambience pleasant. We had the mozzarella appetizer, greek salad and chose the 3 cuts of beef for our platter-for-2. I asked for a full bodied wine, and the recommended ZONTE'S FOOTSTEP "Chocolate Factory" - Shiraz - McLaren Vale was fabulous. The service was prompt. The striploin was tasty, the ribeye fatty and indulgent, and the tenderloin really juicy, all of which were enhanced with the Shiraz. Certainly one of our more enjoyable meals
5
A cozy restaurant with friendly staffs. They remember what we like, especially with the wines. Even if u don't have any wine in mind the friendly staffs will recommend some for you. The restaurant is also family-friendly. My girls love their pizzas! The prices on their menu is reasonable. Our family of 4 had 2 main courses, 2 pizzas, some tapas and a bottle of wine cost about $140. This restaurant has become our usual weekend dining!
4
I tried the lava cake, seafood spaghetti, mussel, ham and mushroom pizza. ...... last but not least, the Riesling Kabinett 2014. Pizza is awesome, pasta taste is average. Mussels fresh and yummy! You gotta try it! I love the ambiance and service. Staff are friendly and attentive. The dining tables are well spaced out to.
4
I've been to this bistro quite a few times now with the family. From the very first time we walked in, the service has been great, which is really refreshing for a neighbourhood bistro. Special mention to Su and Logesh for making us feel welcome each and every time.If you like a nice bottle of wine with your meals, this is the perfect place for reasonably priced yet highly drinkable wines. I do not know of many restaurants with wines priced from around $30 a bottle, although I would recommend that you spend a little more and go for those in the $40 and above range. Definitely worth the money!The food here is nothing to write home about but still reasonably good. With meat dishes going at not more than $25 (???) and pastas not more than $20, do not expect anything more than your usual local "Western-styled" restaurant standard.All in, a great place to go to if you are in the vicinity and looking for an affordable meal with a few glasses of wine and super service
5
Serving of food was fast and prompt.
Price highly value added. Good location. Service of staff is excellent.
5
I've been here so often that these beautiful people greet me on sight! We've always had the best experiences with service staff such as Johan, Malcolm, Logesh and Sue. They're always attentive, prompt and give really good wine recommendations. The food is great for its price and dessert is always on point! They also have a really long list of wines that has never failed to accommodate our varied taste buds. The other staff such as Vicnes and Christopher are also really friendly and ready to help us, be it taking photos or menu options! Visiting Wine Connection has became a regular affair for us as it's an entire package of food and fun. They never judge me for my choice in wine! A great team is the foundation of a great restaurant and Wine Connection is awesome for that! Keep it up
5
Came here a couple of times and there was always a warm welcoming attitude from the staff. The food and drinks here are all pretty well priced. Staff service quality was excellent. Keep it up! I'm looking forward to come here more often. Thanks you very much for such a wonderful experience. Cheers

If I have to give a restaurant a thumbs up for effort and value for money - this would be it. I visited the Wine Connection with a friend to have a glass of wine and a good dinner and I was most pleasantly surprised.This is a Western restaurant with pasta, salads, tapas, meats (grilled, roasted and fried), dessert and wine on its mainstay menu. The selection was big and generous and what impressed me was the pricing - an average of S$9 for a salad, $11 for a tapas, $14 for a pasta, $22 for a really decent steak - I ordered the ribeye. Between us we spent about $66 sharing one ribeye, one tapas (Gambas Prawns), one Ceasar Salad and a glass of wine each. With more than one outlet in Singapore, I also visited their 112 Katong outlet for a drink last night. Both outlets had friendly and helpful service staff which seem to be a trade mark. Growing up in the 80s, it reminded me of a modern day (way more trendy Denny's restaurant) but definitely with better food. decent wine and a happy vibe. Keep up the good work Wine Connection. A definite stop by when I next visit Singapore again

I would like to compliment the wonderful resturant crew for this resturant. The food was very delicious and yummy , the ambience of the resturant was cosy and classy and the service is excellent. We are so impressed when the resturant manager, Sue and Johann presented a lava cake with ice cream to my son when she knew that we were there to celebrate my son's birthday! Its really sweet of her to give us a wonderful surprise. This is the first time we dine at this resturant but it has left us sweet memories that we'll always relish . I am so happy that we discover this resturant and will surely recommend it to my frens! Special thanks and compliments to Sue (not sure if i spelt the name correcetly), thank you for making my son's birthday so special for us! Appreciate your thoughtfulness! We'll be back again soon

Been there for lunch 3 times with friends and dinner twice with family.The lunch deals for $18 for entree and soup/salad/or dessert plus tea/or coffee are a bargain as the food is as per ala carte, not down sized.The Meat Lovers Platter is $49 for 3 items (beef tenderloin, sirloin, ribeye, chicken skewer, BBQ pork rib choices) - tried all! All good, medium beef is done just right, smoky and still slightly red at centre, chicken and pork ribs are tender.The cheese platter, grilled vegetable salad, Parma ham pasta and pizzas are worth the calories ; pDidn't get around to trying their fish and chips but I saw a little boy around 3 years old with his eyes closed take a big sniff at his and break into a blissed out ear to ear grin - not once but three times!Staff were very polite and responsive to requests, cleared dishes quickly and topped up water readily.Restaurant's casual decor is conducive to family dining although it can get noisy even without the piped music

I live very nearby so I've been a few times but was pretty surprised to see it rate so highly in on Tripadvisor. It is definitely not 35th best restaurant in Singapore. The food is so so, prices are pretty cheap but not the finest cuisine. The pizza is not bad, steaks ok for the price. I've noticed the last time I went that they have become much more turnover focussed so expect your plate to be taken the second you lift the last item off the plate and for the waiter to watch you while you eat. They even served the main course at the same time as starter with some nonsense reason like "it's bistro style". We were in and out in less than 30mins for 2 courses. Might as well have gone to a fast-food or hawked stall, which was not what we were looking for on. Saturday night
1
I've been here a couple of times now and have been quite happy, but last night was the last time I set foot in wine connection at Hillv2. Firstly they wouldn't cook my partners tuna steak to how she wanted it, saying they only do medium OR well done, and not medium well, now I'm not a chef, but even I know that just after its medium and just before it's well done they could have taken it off the grill, it's not rocket science. The starter was very good, no complaints there. It was when I watched the waiter give my main course to a couple that had only sat down 3 minutes earlier that it went down hill, he realised his mistake before I had told him and he tried getting the already picked at food back to give to me, which obviously I would have refused. So, when he brought my partners well done tuna steak out, I told him that I knew what he had done, he apologised and said my dinner would be about 5 minutes. So while my partner and I waited for my food, hers got cold as she refused to eat until mine was on the table, even though I had told her to tuck in. When it did come out it was undercooked as they had rushed it out of the kitchen. I ate half of it before asking them to take it away, the fish was mushy and the batter was barely crispy. I asked to speak to the person in charge and asked if my partner could have a glass of wine ($8) as an apology, they told me that they couldn't do that as it was not policy. So we asked for the bill and left briskly. It's a shame as I live within walking distance of wine connection, and I had no complaints before. Luckily for me there is some great restaurants at Hillv2, that I'm sure would love my custom in the future.
4
That was my first visit to the restaurant. I'm not a wine person but the staff with their knowledge definitely made my wine order very much easier. Known for their variety of wine collection I would think that their food would probably be at the average level. Oh my, am I surprise or what.I luv their thin crust pizza - Carnivore. As well as the Bangers and Mash. In fact I've visited another outlet after this and it has sealed the fact that the food at HV2 is definitely much better...Will be back
4
I, my brother and sister-in-law had a late lunch last Sunday and we all had a wonderful time. Their paella is good with generous pieces of chicken and seafood. The wine we had is awesome! Great service! All the staff are friendly and attentive. We will definitely go back and I am also thinking of getting their membership card.
5
The service rendered by the staff here were exceptionally good. And also this place has the perfect environment for a good catch-up or socializing purposes.
4
First time visit with my best pals, had great food and drinks.
Price was reasonable.
Well served by staff, Johann.
Definitely gonna be a regular place to hang out.
5
Excellent service provided by Johann, delicious food and relaxing environment.
Highly recommended as it worth every penny.
5
The food and champagne is awesome! Service was fast and efficient, will be coming back soon and will surely recommend to friends!
4
The 2nd time visiting this outlet and I got to say, its the best outlet for wine connection. Besides saying how awesome the food is, I got to emphasize how attentive the servers are especially the manager, Zack. They will specially come to the table and ask if the food is alright, taking care of what we need. All these which I can't get from other wine connection outlets
5
Everything is good about this restaurant. The quality of food is awesome, the service is excellent, and pleasantly fast and efficient. The wine selection leaves you with ample choices, at affordable prices. Overall, our family had a good time together. Only setback was the pepperoni on the carnivous pizzas, taste too salty and overbearing which would otherwise have been a perfect pizza. Definitely will be back 
5
The quality of food was good, great price. And most important thing the service was excellent. The team was fast and efficient. And would like to further my thanks to jamie who provide such a wonderful night for us. She is very polite, fast and efficient.Great job team, keep up the good work
4
Decent food at economical price! Serving size(for pastas and beef dishes) was just right. Friendly and approachable staff! They were warm,sincere and professional. Great service at this outlet, and hence the great dining experience I had with my family!*The apple crumble and chocolate lava cake both taste good ,and are reasonably priced at $6 each
5
My fiancee and I visited the branch at Cuppage, and the food and wine are consistently good. Great value for money for tasty and well-presented portions. The cheaper bottles of wine (< $40) were very good and go well with the meat and cheese boards. The staff at HillV2, however, were top-notch -- much better than the branch at Cuppage. The young staff team were warm and friendly without being overbearing. Well done
5
Nice place to dine and have some wine! The service staff are great! Always there, fast and courteous. The efficiency of the kitchen is amazing. Food arrives surprisingly quick and is of good quality. First restaurant I have seen that delivers the bill digitally on tablet. All together a great experience
4
Su and her team took care of the 20 of us well. Overall there was a wide variety from the menu to choose from. We had a good time.
4
Been a regular at HillV2 outlet for the last 4 months, the nice ambient couple with friendly staffs, good foods and wines all at a reasonable price will draw me back for more.....oh yes, with my group of friends
4
Range of western food, assorted salads +\~ S$10, soups ard S$7, cheese platter, main courses from chicken to BBQ pork ribs n there's beef n lamb for red meat lovers, as well as pastas n pizzas, n of course their Spanish paella, etc....Priced reasonably with consistent quality, and good service too! Better yet, wines here are priced to let you enjoy the alcohol (by glass / by bottle, yr pick) without feeling too much of a pinch. Go to their website for details on menu n prices. They have several outlets so pick which area is convenient for you. But do note fri/sat evenings are usually heavily packed so be prepared to wait, especially the outlet at Robertson Quay is most popular (being this location attracts lots of working personnel plus the residential crowd staying there as well)
4
I begin with great service simply because service at F&B establishments in Singapore are going downhill faster than oil prices, so an establishment with prompt service gets really high ratings because of the scarcity of something as basic as decent service.The food selection is great, a range of platters, pizzas, pastas and meats is available. We had the cold cut platter and breads to go with our wine. Followed by the carnivore pizza which was really great. So to keep it short the food was great, well cooked and presented.Goes without saying that the wine options here were amazing, covered all the major wine producing regions of the worlds and varieties. You can either go by the glass (selected wines) or by the bottle (most of them). The store is in-house so you can take home something you like.All in all the food was great, the wine was good and the ambience was magical. And all this can be a waste if you have to wait for someone to take your order, to serve and finally to get you the bill. NONE OF THAT HERE - the service is prompt, the staff is well-versed with what the place has to offer and there is an unrobotic smile of the faces of most of the staff.So all in all, great experience, hats off to Sue and her Team, keep the momentum going, looking forward to my visit again
4
Yesterday was our 4th. visit to Wine Connection's HillV2 branch. We have visited other outlets before, but this place has the best Service so far. Su and her Team are very attentive and made sure that everything is in order. So far, we were never disappointed with their food quality either. My boys love their Pizza and Spaghettis. I love their cold cut platters. It has been one of our favorite brunch place. Keep up your Service Level
2
The ambience is nice, but the food was really quite average, nothing to rave about. They offer set lunches for a reasonable price, which is quite value for money. Perhaps it was just an anomaly for me, having read all the other reviews, but the service I received was quite substandard. The service was too slow, and even getting the bill took forever. Not sure if I'd frequent this place, given that the food is quite average and that there are more interesting options around HillV2 (eg. Japanese food, Italian food etc)

This little treasure is a bit off the beaten track, tucked away in sleepy Hillview and away from heavy vehicle and human traffic. Doesn't sound so good for business in general, but works for the likes of residents and close neighbours in Hume Ave and Bukit Panjang sick of pub grub along Rail Mall and run-of-the-mill fare from other shopping centres. I'm there with friends most of the time - the polished but unpretentious interior is perfect for wind-down work day dinner, and is the perfect setting for catch-ups and the occasional ruckus (after a drink of two or three heh). I have been with everything from 2 friends to 8, and we've always been seated very comfortably. What struck me the most about Wine Connection Bistro is how affordable the menu is. I have patronised several of their other branches previously, but have never thought to order food. A quick scan through the menu and you are instantly impressed by how humbly priced their fare is. (More money for wine yay!) Personally, the stars here are their 4 Cheese Pizza, Salmon Ravioli, and Spanish Gambas. Finish it all off with their oozy Lava Torte if you're feeling extra decadent. Naturally, food isn't Wine Connection's main selling point. But coupled with a great price point and managed expectations, I think they do it pretty damn well. I'm no wine connoisseur - I am not beneath boxed, NTUC wine and cheap moscato - so having someone take the time to squeeze in a little crash course, followed by an excellent recommendation is always welcome. There were 2 separate occasions where this happened. The first, very candidly, was over the phone while I had a friend to pick up a bottle. I didn't get her name, but the staff on the other end of the line was patient, informative and very helpful in aligning my preferences with a bottle. Her recommendation was spot on - I thoroughly enjoyed the medium-bodied merlot that my friend had picked up. The second was by Ronald, who accommodated our pining for something "heavier". He coupled his recommendation with a quick wine appreciation workshop which was immensely entertaining and educational at the same time! Still can't say that I can tell my merlot from carbenet sauvignon, but I now know that I do like a good full-bodied glass with an oaky aftertaste. Ronald's service is extremely commendable. He was helpful but never pushy, and regularly checked on us. Plus points for finding a charger for me when my iPhone went bust! (Note: He told us he'll be leaving the restaurant soon. Good luck for all future endeavours, Ronald! Pretty sure you'll be good at whatever it is you set out to do if you keep up the awesome disposition.) It's not just Ronald who shows exemplary service. The staff at Wine Connection Bistro Hillv2 are consistently pleasant and charming. I've never have been waited on by someone terrible or nasty, thank goodness. It's smiles all round and the light banter during orders really settle you in. Keep it up, team. See you soon ;

I live in the neighbourhood and enjoy coming to this little Wine Connection location at Hillview Rise for the following reasons :1. GREAT STAFFThe staff know my name well and are always so courteous, polite, welcoming and professional. The female manager is always smiling and eager to please customers. There are three servers who are particularly great there. They always greet me nicely and remember things that I like from previous visits. 2. THE FOODAlthough the food is not at the very top of the Singaporean fancy dining scene, the food is often done well enough and serves as a nice alternative to a home-cooked dinner on a busy weekday where one doesn't have the energy to cook. I often have my staple salads and meat dishes which I enjoy each time. The only thing I did not like in the menu is the " fish and chips ". Although cooked very well at a generous portion, perhaps, I didn't like the fact that dory was the fish used for it. However, it was not due to the cook's fault...I am just particular about the type of fish used. The portions for each meal are just right ( and sometimes, even a little larger than expected ). I often order the salads and a simple appetizer due to the sizes
5
I was there on the 8th April at 6pm ,with friends for dinner & wines,The manager,Zack was at the door to welcome us with a very warm smile,upon entering the Bistro,the staff are all smiling and wishing us .We were given a table near to the glass panel,the view was great.I order our food and wine,services was excellent,food was great and the price was reasonably affordable,We drank 4 bottles of red wine.Overall,the service was beyond expectation is like having fine dinning service,The manager, Zack,was very observant and prompt in taking care of our dinning needs.I highly recommend this bistro for the ambience,service,wines and food,Our compliments goes to the Manager,Zack and Staff.Great Bistro!Will defintely be back for more wines.BS Go

Nice food, pleasantly polite waiters, posh dining. What more can you ask for.Their steak tenderloin mixed with blue cheese sauce is a must try as well as their creme brulee which is bursting with sweetness from every bite especially with its outer crispyness of hard caramel and custard cream on the inside.It's at HillV2. Surrounded by a peaceful neighbourhood with nice scenery
5
I heard of the Wine Connection Bistro from my daughter and I have eaten there twice and no doubt many more times in the future . Excellent ambience, excellent service and best of all excellent food at reasonable rates.
5
Excellent service with fantastic food. The ambience of the place is worth the travel, with great selection of music. It is a good place for socializing with friends, with its affordable prices.
5
Service staff were friendly. The food is great and the wine is very affordable. Overall a great experience.
4
The best way to enjoy your lunch and dinner with lovely food and friendly staff, I'm always there with colleagues or friends.
5
Excellent services provided by Shian and Johan, great place to chill out and nice food.
Highly recommended for place to chill out.
Their services is excellent
5
Been a regular of this wine connection outlet since it was opened and have to say that they offer quality food at very reasonable prices. Wine selection is wide and well priced. What really sets it apart from most restaurants is the impeccable service of the staff which is hard to find in Singapore. Very prompt and attentive service every time when I visit the place. Decided to write a review on this place to give it some credit after reading a recent review that its lowest of the low which I strongly debate on. The food there is delicious and for the price you pay for, you won't get it anywhere in Singapore. The manager of the outlet, Su and her dedicated team never fail to make my every visit welcoming and memorable. Keep it up
5
This is my very 1st comment on Tripadvisor. Am so grateful & thankful to Su, Zack & their friendly patient team for making our surprise birthday party for sis a smooth & memorable one. Food & wine prices are very reasonable. We love the rich royal chocolate birthday cake so much, thanks Mr Chef. Restaurant setup & ambience was cozy great for family, company events n gatherings. Tenderloin Steak, grilled seabass, spanish style gambas & thin and crispy pizza Highly recommended. Prosecco $30 nett/btl, good deal.Thank you Wine Connection & staff, we will definitely be back soon
1
Don't understand this place can be so highly rated. Even though food and wine is cheap it's not worth a visit. Staff are not professional, waiting time was long and the foos tasted like straight from microwave.Stay awa
5
I had the set-lunch and you have there are various choices for the main course, the starter and either coffee or dessert. I chose the medium sirloin steak with red wine sauce and it was done perfectly. However the asparagus soup could be more concentrated.. seems a tad diluted. We also ordered the cold cuts cheese platter and it was superb and paella which has a generous amount of chicken in it and very reasonable prices for the portions given.There is a wide wine selection and the prices are very affordable. The service staff were also very attentive and prompt.This is my first visit here and I will be back to try the other items on the menu
5
 Back after a month of absence. Feels so good to b back though. Seen few familiar faces. It was nice to see Johann and the services provided by him plus other staff. It is personal n sincere. Their service and food never fails to make me think of revisiting after every visit.  I will foresee myself coming back very frequently.  Good job to everyone in Wine Connection Bistro @HillV2.
5
Had delicious pizza and steak at this restaurant. The service was excellent. Keep up the good work! I will come back for dinner again soon!
5
We had pizza and ravioli. Food was excellent. Good variety of wine and beer. Excellent service especially by Christopher. Will definitely be coming again soon.
5
Kudos to nice ambience, good food and great service. Food delivered extremely fast, love the truffle oil fettuccine and the thin-crust pizza!!
4
Went there with some friends for a night of chill. Service was good and attentive. :)
Ronald was cheerful and recommended is a wine when we were clueless. Thank u!
5
Fantastic ambiance, great food and lovely service. What else one need to spend an evening? This place has it all.
4
I went there with a couple of my good friends and we were pleasantly surprised that the food was good and reasonably priced . The staff were friendly and the place is quite cozy. Wine was good as well. Would definitely visit them more often and bring more friends there as well
5
Organized a wine and dine for my company's executives. As an organizer, it was a breeze working with Su and her team. The service was great. Friendly and responsive team of service crew. Food was good, wine recommendations was reliable. Everything was so in control. They really made my evening, for the first time, I hear all positive feedbacks from my colleagues about an event. Great job Su and her team
4
We went there for dinner a few times, the last time with 2 friends. Food was good as usual, although if you order the tenderloin the steak size is very small, nothing like what the picture shows. Better to go for pizza or pasta. Other than that, food is very good, prices are affordable, and the experience is great. We'll be back
5
The first time i visited this place. I liked it immediately. The staff were all very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food we ordered came really fast and it was simply delicious. Prices were reasonable. I will definitely make this one of my regular joints
5
It looks like one of those regular bistros. Went in with a friend without much expectation. Ordered a grilled vegetable salad, margarita pizza and a seasame crusted tuna steak. The service was prompt. In ten minutes we had all three dishes served. The salad was fresh and tasty. The tuna steak "medium" was nicely done and the pizza with a thin crust was light and how we like it. The serving was generous, price reasonable, highly recommeded.
5
Great ambience!
Coupled with marvelous customer experience, ie attentive and enthusiastic service staff...
Not forgetting yummy delicious food wash down with smoothing alcoholic drinks!
Thanks for the truely fantastic nite-out and dining experience!
Keeping it going!!! :)
5
Recommended by friends as a good place for dinner, we decided to check out its credentials for Sunday brunch. It proved to be lovely, with very personable service provided by Su and her team. Ordering pizza, meat platter and paella, we topped it off with sumptuous desserts and coffee. We will definitely be back soon

Not to be missed!Shout out to Johann and Zac for the great service and allowing us to carry out our traditional Chinese 'Lou Hei', showed great flexibility and great efforts to meet customers' needs!

I and 4 other couples had our early Valentine's date last Feb 12. I and my 4 male friends arranged for a surprise dinner dates with our wives. I sent an email to the contact address in the restaurant's website and got a reply in 1 hour. After then, the replies were very fast and supportive on some logistic needs for the surprise.During the day, the service was perfect from the arrangement of the sofa/tables, placing guitar in a location that our wives cannot see it and the delivery of the flowers/song lyrics when I asked for the bill. All were executed greatly.This is on top of the nice ambience and the food which are great and value for money. We will definitely be back. Two thumbs up

had a wonderful evening with my wife at the wine connection on our anniversary day. It was made even more special 'coz of the excellent service by the staff and specially Alex from Venezuela who went out of his way to buy a drink for us. The food and the wine was great and value for money.

I have introduced this place to many friends, colleagues and business partners. They are very happy with my recommendations. We love the sirloin steak and sea-bass- done with perfection. (Only request is that the steak sauce- to be a bit more generous by using a slight bigger sauce cup). The meal complete with a chocolate Lava cake and coffee was awesome. A great way to end the meal ❤️. Bernard

A nice and comfortable place to have dinner with your family! Beef tenderloin was excellent! Pricings were affordable. Staff were friendly and approachable.

Wine Connection @ HillV2 is one of my preferred place to hang out after my hectic working days. Nice ambience, good wine and excellent service staff.
5
Visited twice within the same week and tried out their recommendations of red wine at both occasions. Service staffs are friendly and professional. Food served are of high standard. Will definately visit more often and will be good if there's outdoor seats

Great service by logash. Nice french wine. Cheap food nice and yummy! They should serve Heinz ketchup goes very well with the wedges served with their tenderloin steak. Recommended, nice ambience.
5
Service is impeccable. Commend Sue, Johanne and Logesh for attentive and service with finesse. Excellent recommendations on wine and food.

I said hands up for this outlet.
Food is good as usual but the best thing is service is the bomb here, bestest service among all the other outlet I've been. And you guys have a terrific manager. We'll done Zac!

I have been here a few times with my family. Enjoy the cozy ambience, friendly service and cold beers. One of my favorite places to visit.

My wife and I had our joint birthday party there. All our friends and us really enjoyed the location with excellent food (just all: beef, pasta, salads and cold cuts), marvellous selection of wine with something for everyones taste. Besides all of that the very outstanding service of the team topped everything
5
The staff made us feel really welcome and well looked after. I was particularly impressed by their product knowledge and attentiveness. Alex the manager, recommended the best wine I have ever tasted, he really made an effort to make a connection with us and I'll be looking for him next time. When you're there you have to try the chocolate brownie, it's to die for. The tenderloin was a fantastic price too! You don't get a great steak for that price anywhere else.

I have been here in a few times, enjoying the service and the food. The service is one of the best I have ever experienced in Singapore. The prices are reasonable. Ambience is suitable for couples,families, or office colleagues.

this is my first time visiting the place and I am pleasantly surprised by the waiters there . the service is good and the food is not bad . Will definitely visit again .

Tasty food served in fine dining style but cost a fraction of what you pay for an established restaurant. Friendly staff, spontaneous and easy to communicate with. Good Job keep it up !!
Wishing all at Wine Connection a Holy and Blessed Christmas !!

I frequent Wine Connection Tapas & Bar@Roberson Walk. So happy to see a Wine Connection Bistro in the West! The place is not as crowded, staffs are friendly and more importantly the wine here are priced much lower than the other outlets in town. Keep up the good work and merry Christmas to all

They listen carefully, always accommodating our requests. The staff always find time to chat and nothing is too much to ask. The food is great value and always made to specific requests. We love visiting and would def recommend to couples, families and groups

The restaurant is no different to any other restaurant but the engagement and attention to customers that was exhibited by the staff is highly commendable especially in Singapore. Chia How and Sue who were my first encounters to an initial feedback attended to ti gracefully and I was pleasantly surprised to know that the feedback was attended to through their channel of communication. While the food is commendable, the attention on sesrvice by staff is two times commendable. A great restaurant does not only serve good food, but the authencity and the simplicity of the staff in providing great customer experience makes a great difference. The restaurant offers a wide range of delectable selection at reasonable pricing too, not to mention their wine selcetion. I do enjoy my moments at this restaurant, where the staff recognises me and acknowledges my presence. Sue and Chia How never fail to come by for a good chit chat. I make it a point to visit the restaurant at least once a week to see familiar faces, plonked in an obscure space in the outlet.

Good quality food at pocket-friendly price - love their steak especially that matches perfectly with wine and great staff that always receive us with warmth & comfort. With just steps away from home, it is our weekly regular dining place - be it an elaborate nite with steak n wine, or a simple comfortable pizza/pasta dinner. Our comfort/cozy place

Celebrated our wedding dinner last October 14 and our friends and family really enjoyed the amazing selection of food, cheese & wine and fantastic service from all the staff especially Mr. Alexander Gonzalez who personally looked after us and always at his best from Wine Connection Robertson Quay to Hillv2... You are truly exceptional! Grazie mille!!

Being a regular to the Roberson quay outlet, my husband n myself were so happy to know of this latest addition. Not only is the environment cater more to family. It is cosy and without the loud music we experienced at their Roberson Quay outlet. We've since being returning to the 'HillV2 outlet more then ever. The food is great (try the tuna steak) and the price is reasonable. The bar has a good selection of reasonably priced good wine. Most of all the friendly staff, especially the Manager Su who always made our trips there very comfortable. Wine Connection has thus become our no 1 choice of dinning and entertaining place. Well, let hope not only the food standard maintain but most of all, Manager Su and her wonderful staff continue with their friendly professional service.
