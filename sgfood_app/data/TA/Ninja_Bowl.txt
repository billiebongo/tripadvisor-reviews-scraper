Not my first visit, have been going back to Ninja Bowl cos food is great as usual! Recommend the Kaiseb Bowl if you love scallops and lemon butter sauces! Love that there’s no service charge!
4
Food is delicious no doubt, but for the slightly more health conscious who chooses not to add on a grain the portion is not filling enough. Even when added udon to a dish, portion size was still rather small
4
Great ambience,cosy environment
Location was a bit difficult to find, but food was good. Will come again for a quick meal!
4
The miso broth was pretty fragrant for the Shinjuku however the salmon was a little bland and dry. For the Tokyo Superfood, quinoa and egg were fragrant.
4
Love the food there! Service is good too. I had the tsukiji with Ninja rice and melon milk drink. Yums!
5
The establisment has a cosy atmosphere. Service is superb. It would be better if food is served warm/hot
2
The raved place was very empty during lunch hour and the portions weren't that big and the ingredients weren't premium to charge us $26 per bowl. To add quinoa was $3 . Disappointing. Won't return.
4
Great brunch.. food was fantastic.. although the place is alittle hard to find.. will be back for more.
4
A little pricey but food's pretty good. Need to walk quite a distance from the mrt stations nearby to reach the cafe.
3
The food is fresh but taste wise, nothing to shout about. It is also rather pricey. A cosy place if you want to eat clean.
5
It was easy to make reservations even though it was last minute. The cafe was not overly noisy, though the tables can still be slightly further apart. Food was delicious, satiating and really healthy (if you choose the right options).
4
This is not my first visit to Ninja Bowl. Returned for my third visit recently and I’m still digging their wholesome rice bowls! Yum. Friendly staff and cosy ambience... it is a nice place to chill with your loved ones.
2
The bowl is super small. The content of it, the dish itself is big which gives you the impression you have reasonable amount of food. WRONG! The price is crazy, about 20SGD for a dish. Taste ok, nothing special. NOT WORTH.
3
Ingredients are quite fresh but portion to little. Braised pulled beef have slight overpowering taste. Add on ninja rice which is actually brown rice, again portion too little for $2! Nice ambience, quite empty on Tues night.
3
Delicious serving of poke but with so many cheaper yet quality competitors popping out, its food doesn't stand out as being value for money.
4
Ninja Bowl resturent service some good food. must have they sea food. its very fresh and have a well cooked.
3
Have lunch with my wife and son. Poor services and average foods but expensive. However, the foods are healthy.
4
The food was quite value for the price. Portion was surprisingly good for a grown man like me and the taste was spot on!
4
Yummy and healthy food but thought it's a bit pricey for the portion. Our group of 4 were all hungry at 3 after an early lunch there
4
Generous serving size of the Torinosu ninja bowl, with the shrimp and vegetable kakiage fried to perfection. Light and crispy. On the other hand, the Genki ninja bowl was flavourful with the korean beansprouts nicely marinated and complemented well with the Unagi, which is soft and almost melts in your mouth
4
Departing from the usual 1 carb + 2 veggies + 1 protein approach, Ninja Bowl offers a variety of pre-combined delicious grian bowl combos. SO GOOOD>
4
Love the food and its pocket-friendly place! I have been here for few times and still loving it.
My friends also enjoyed the food.
4
The rice bowls were great. French toast was not to our liking as its soggy.
Price is slightly more expensive for the portion.
5
portion size was good, very filling even with the garden salad base. Price was reasonable for the quality and quantity.
3
Ninja Bowl was really crowded on Saturday. Despite making reservations, we had to wait for 15-20 mins before finally getting a table. Service staff looks very overwhelmed but food overall was decent.
3
Food was decent with nothing standing out in terms of taste, selection or presentation. Think what I had was the Tontoro. Portions were very small for the price and not particularly good value. Service level was good. Staff were friendly and responsive.
4
Loved the cozy setting of this place. They had a variety of healthy bowls to choose from, especially liked the smoked duck one. Service was efficient, our food came quite quickly. Clean bathroom as well.
5
It was our first visit there. Overall, the visit was pleasant, food was great and most importantly, staff were polite and always put on a smile on their faces.
4
Easy to locate the place. Reservation made for dinner and service was quick. As it is our 1st time there, took while to look through the menu and we were statisfied with what we had.
5
We ordered Yasai and Sakana bowl with rice and orzo! Orzo is quite a different texture that is worth the try. The whole combination is a difference taste experience as well. Ingredients are generous and fresh. We felt full despite thinking the portion was a bit small.
5
Definitely a great place for gathering and trying out all the bowls they have in their menu. A way for a healthy lifestyle
5
This little restaurant is really nice ! The food is really tasty, there are full of good quality and healthy ingredients in the different plates.
Excellent choice for our first evening in Singapore !
Highly recommended :)
5
i tried the scallop bowl, poutine fries and duck breast bowl. They were all very good in my opinion. I would definitely come back again.
wifi password is the telephone number on the receipy.
5
Seldom get to eat something so delicious and healthy at the same time. Ninja bowl is awesome :) will go back for more!
3
Had the dish with the confit salmon as well as the Pork Cutlet with Mash (All day brunch) and it was quite disappointing. The salmon was overdone and the pork was over cooked as well. The only plus of this lunch was the truffle fries
3
Popped into Ninja Bowl for a quick late lunch of mash with pork katsu curry and pulled pork okonomiyaki. Pretty pricey for the quality.
5
made a reservation (highly recommended to do so) for 2 at 7pm. place was already quite crowded. the wait for food was about 10-15mins. the food came out hot and ig-worthy. their coconut lemon mint drink is worth a try!
4
Grain bowls were rather delicious, but I've had better grain bowls at other restaurants with bigger portions. Staff were really friendly and located in an interesting part of town so big pluses for that!
2
Ordered salmon sashimi, confit salmon bowl, both added ninja rice and fried chicken. Drinks we had coconut drink. My fav is the fried chicken. Spent $70+ for 2 pax. Food not work the money, tables too near each other and doesn't accept credit cards but price of the food are so expensive.
1
Realising it closed at 2130hrs, me and wife made our dinner order at 2050hrs. But the order were served between 2110hrs to 2120hrs. At 2130hrs, a young lady staff started to overturn half the restaurant chairs onto the tables. She then started to sweep the floor with a broom and instantly, the air around were filled with dust particles. Oblivious that the diners were still dining, the staff went on to mop the floor. While we were still dining, we were rudely shocked by the "uncivilised" way to treat their guests like "dirt". At that moment, there were three tables (including us) that were still dining. Hastily, we finished our dinner at 2145hrs and left the restaurant. From the moment we stepped off, I swore that it will be our last visit to Ninja Bowl.
5
Very impressed by the service provided by the wait staff. They were all smiley and friendly, service is prompt. The food is delicious, and beautifully plated. Will definitely return again.
One suggestion would be to include the tax in the price dislayed on the menu.
5
Enjoyed the food here very much. Food were yummy and flavorful. They were healthy yet doesn't compromise on taste. Definitely will return!
4
A good place to chill, food was good as well. location was quite near my workplace. Can improve on the drinks menu, and do make a reservation at peak hours!
4
tried the chicken leg confit and was pleasantly surprised! the meat was quite tender and really fragrant.
5
Place was abit hard to find as there is no much signboard, but one thing their service was Super good! Food was nice but kinda of expensive. :)
5
Been here countless times and the food never disappoints. Mentaiko scrambled will always be my favourite!
4
Everything is awesome, just the the place is a bit small! Would advise if you reserve a seat in advance before heading over!
4
Everything was good! I love the food and the ambience. However, it's definitely a once-in-a-bluemoon restaurant for me since it's soooooo expensive!!
4
Went to Ninja Bowl for the 1st time on Saturday with my friends after hearing good reviews about it. We ordered truffle fries to share and it was pretty good! I ordered the Noka )24-hour braised beef cheek, baby corn, korean beansprouts, mixed nuts, onsen egg, semi-dried tomatoes). I added on quinoa (extra $3) and it was pretty delicious, however I would prefer the bowl to be hotter upon serving! Nonetheless, it is worth trying once
4
Service was good despite the place being packed to the brim.Price wise on the steep side given the small food portion.Food quality was not too bad.Doubt I will return. Many other grain bowl shops out there which are way cheaper with good quality and bigger portions.Can get a bit noisy as the place is pretty cramp.
4
Dining experience at ninja bowl was good, food was
Definitely value for money due With generous servings. Will def be back
4
Great that I've reserved seats as it was fully packed with customers in line! The food was great but the portion Was too little for me.
5
the food was very delicious and service was top notch.. although the location is slightly out of the way, the food really made up for it... highly recommended!!!
4
I enjoyed my brunch there with my friend. Ordered a unagi bowl and unagi brunch set, both are healthy and presentable!
4
We ordered the scallop bowl and the chicken bowl. The scallops were delicious, mussels were slightly dry. Chicken was seasoned beautifully and had perfect crispy skin. Overall great food:)
4
The food at Ninja Bowl exceeded expectations. This is my second visit where my first visit was for brunch and this time round for dinner. Food was really yummy and healthy as well.
3
Generally an average dinner. Food was rather underwhelming. Could have gotten something better at that price range in Ninja Bowl.
5
Great location, although quite a discreet shopfront. Brunch was delicious! Good portion size. Would go again and recommend!
3
Great presentation, healthy and nutritious. But we were kinda disappointed with the taste. For example, the salmon confit I ordered was too dry.
4
Bowls ranging from $18 to $24 with grains/salad included, and excluding GST. Quite pricey for lunch to be honest, without a lunch set available. Plenty of seats available. Salmon poke bowl costs $18 while grassfed australian beef is at $24. Ordered the beef but quite disappointed to get only 7 small cubes of beef. Love the sauteed mushrooms though, and grilled vegs. Unlikely to be back for lunch time. Complimentary water availabl
5
located in a relatively quiet street in between tanjong pagar and chinatown, ninja bowl is a great place for a hiatus from the buzz of the CBD.
3
Was greeted by their smiling crew upon stepping in the shop which was nice.
Food portion quite big and presentations were nice but taste wise, they were not that fantastic and for the price paid, would have expected more.
5
The whole place feels very relaxing and is definitely a good place to chill out with friends/family/your gf or bf. Love the dish we ordered, definitely will return back for more.
4
Second time here and the food is still as good. Portions may look small at first, but boy, was it a filling meal!
3
Ambience was good but difficult to locate place. Signboard is tiny. Food was good. Bring cash or nets.
4
lunch time more crowed there, so i prefer go there at dinner time. cauliflower tempura is interesting.
5
Fantastic rice bowls! Delicious and flavorful! Will definitely return to try other dishes very soon.
3
The toast was really meh. Expensive and not worth the price. Go for the bowls instead. The vegetarian bowl wasn't worth it either. I think the seafood would be a better choice.
5
Had been here for the third time. Brought my family here on the Father's Day as I've wanted them to try it since the food was good the first 2 times. But I think the food taste better on weekdays night as maybe there were less of a crowd than on weekends.
4
Overall, the food were delicious and healthy. The portion of meat given was generous and the accompanying vegetables were nicely done and flavourful. However, the Salmon was slight dry and the Beef was abit too salty. The mentaiko scallop brunch set was abit of a disappointment as the bread was charred at the sides.
4
Food is pretty good (the usual poke bowls) and ambience is nice with friendly staff. Only issue i had was the noisy door that keeps banging shut.
5
Ninja bowls prove that healthy meals can be tasty too. And the food presentation is so instagrammable
4
Went during non peak hour. This is my 2nd visit there and i will still go back there in the future. Loved Shinjuku comfort!
5
Definitely try the scallops and the tuna tataki. Every time I go it seems to get better! Owners are super nice too.
5
First time trying~healthy and quite value for money. Will go back again. Hope to get the chope vouchers next time!
4
Prices and names are misleading... with a "bowl" you'd expect the bowl and ingredients to come with rice but nope! You have to add $2 on for rice and more if you prefer other carbs.That being said, would recommend the scallops but not the steak. Steak got a bit tough as time passed
4
Healthy food that is yummy! We had the Yasai bowls but they dont come with any carbo... You have to top up $2 for salad, orzo or ninja rice which isnt entirely brown rice... A bit disappointing that the 'bowl' doesnt come with any carbo. Thus, making the entire meal a bit overpriced... The salmon was fresh and well-marinated though. Portion of salmon is quite good. The portion of the add-on carbo is quite small. The bowl left us feeling not hungry but not overly satisfied...
1
Honestly, this is the worst lunch my team and i have ever eaten. For 14 bucks + 2 bucks for rice, the portion is only half a bowl. About 5 spoon of rice. Are you guys serious? What kind of a lunch cost 19 bucks and doesnt even make you food? Taste is decent but when its so generously sprinkled with bean sprouts yet cutting back on chicken chunks, i am actually amazed this terrible place has 4 stars. Enjoy your food people, this is definitely not worth the money. Maybe the management should change their name to HALF BOWL, because that is what it is.
5
Unlike other grain bowl places, Ninja bowl's servings are of a substantial amount. My favourite is the Noka Grain Bowl, which surprisingly has a decent amount of meat. The beef cheeks are braised so perfectly tender and coupled with the baby corn and tau gey just creates an amazing flavour.
4
The bowl I had was delicious - confit salmon, edamame, pickled cucumbers, carrots, and brown rice. Staff were very friendly and informative and there was a really cool lunchtime atmosphere. The only drawback was they do not accept payment by visa/mastercard, which is problematic for tourists like me who do not have a NETS card and may not have enough cash on them
5
Friendly staff, portions were just right and the free wifi was a definite bonus! Had the Genki ninja bowl!
4
Love their salmon poke but prices have just gone up one notch after gst implementation 😐 Can give their cakes a pass though.
4
Staff was very friendly to call and inform on operating hours and also to follow up when i was late. Food-wise is good as usual. Will be back to try their famous french toast (when i have extra stomach space).
4
Arrived at the place very early at around 11.45am although my reservation was for 12.30pm. Good service. The staff let me know where we can get free water.
4
Came for brunch on Good Friday morning. The coffee was good and the brunch selections were good also. Best of all, no crowd at 10.30am.
4
a little squeezy as place is small..
overall good experience.. food was awesome too.. reservation recommended as tables are limited..
5
The place is small but has nice ambience. Has a good range for mains & brunch dishes and food served is of good quality as well.
4
I always order the Kaisen bowl because I can't resist the pan seared scallops done just right so they're never rubbery in texture. If prices weren't so steep I would have lunch there every day but I'm sure half of what I pay goes to real estate (greedy landlords
3
Brought my daughter on this 3rd visit, but this time, the stale and very salty flank beef in Ushi marred my dining experience. We also ordered Yasai, Tsujiki, Ebisu and Coconut Lemon mint which were good. Highlighted the salty beef to staff but they said it was supposed to be salty. Oh well. With the implementation of GST, index of 'value-for-money' dropped.
4
We were there 14 min late and our reservation was released. That's how crowded the place gets on a weekend. The wait stuff gave us a spot at the corner. Food wise, while somewhat similar to Ninja Cut, I do prefer the menu option and staff at Seah St
4
Food was great overall with a nice industrial atmosphere. The service is good with friendly staffs. Will be back for sure. Portion could be improved though.
4
Ordered the unagi bowl, had quite a number of bones but it was soft so it was still alright. The scallop bowl was soft and fresh too!
4
The food are nice but disappointed that the beef was sold out on the day we went.
French toast was alright despite it been highly raved by many. The staff were friendly.
5
Quality of service was nice and food served was amazing.
Ambience was really decent as well and the place was easy to find.
4
Unpretentious place for an afternoon read and a good dessert. Try the french toast. Looks good and definitely appetising.
4
We were worried that the food are too 'green' but they turned out to be generous and tasty. Very satisfied. (the side dishes were not that nice though)
5
My friend and I were looking to have an early brunch and ninja bowl was the perfect choice. They opened at 9.30am unlike some cafe which only open around 10.30 (but kitchen is 11am)the food served in Ninja bowl? Healthy, hearty!the service crew was really friendly too. And for those who could not live without caffeine, their coffee is not too bad too :)
4
I had the ninja okonomiyaki and it was a really interesting and savoury dish. And all the other dishes look so good, I'm definitely going back to try them! Not downside is the acoustics aren't very good due to the concrete floor and it gets extremely loud, makes it hard to tal
4
Not a huge place , more like a corner small cafe at the shophouses near kreta ayer. Most of the food served are for the more health conscious dieters. Which i feel is plus point these days with too much unhealthy food around. Salmon, unagi, egg, mussels, scallops, chicken breast, lean cut beef..... good mix of proteins and vegetables. I ordered the kaisen which is the mussels and hokkaido scallops served with mushrooms and carrots. I did not want the mussels and the staff gladly replace them with two scallops. Had the cold pess juice to go with the food. One thing to beware- it does not come with rice base or noodles. That is an add on at extra sgd2. The carrots were sweet and the lemon light sauce on the scallops were perfec
5
We found this place purely because we had a craving for quinoa and I was looking for some place that had it. Hands down best place if you need your quinoa fix. I went for brunch and stupidly didn't get the quinoa or poke bowls and their other brunch stuff wasn't great. But if you ask me, the Unagi + quinoa totally made up my next time round(
5
Everything about Ninja Bowl was amazing! Better to make reservation so you don't have to wait in line as the place is quite small
5
We had the Noka bowl and Mentaiko Scramble. Both were awesome and served quickly.
The staff were friendly and helpful too, so it was a pleasant experience!
4
Great and cozy place to have snack or simply to catch with friends. Love their Ebisu which is pan-seared Hokkaido scallops with mussels cooked in miso butter cream served with toast. Yummy.
5
With the chope voucher, the food was more value for money. Tastewise, I think the fancy french was really good.
4
Place a bit noisy with loud music and crowd talking.Food and service is good.will be back to try more
4
If you love creamy sauce, scallops and mussels, Ebisu is a must try. Love the coffee and ambience here too.
2
So the food was okay, but I would never go back again, because the restaurant was just too noisy. I can't even hear myself think let alone have a decent conversation with my partner. It's more of the space configuration probably although the lotus music certainly didn't help.
4
Can here on Sunday morning looking for a healthy brunch option given we liked Ninja Cut ... & it didn't disappoint. Menu is full of varied options; my Yasai bowl was a salmon poke with lots of salad & partner went scallop bowl with udon. We'll be back.Coffee (piccolo lattes) were bitter & so I'd go simple for coffee choices
5
Ninja bowl is always my to go place when it comes to healthier option. Love their beef cheek bowl (known as Noka) and their Unaji bowl. Furthermore, since it's a self service order at the counter, the price is nett. Their coconut drink is rather refreshing too!
4
love the brunch menu, all dishes are delicious! Personally feel that the scallop is not very fresh but overall is good, ordered honey yuzu tea but sadly no honey taste at all and it's just like a normal tea bag with boiled water. However, will try their bowls next time and avoid the tea
2
the food was normal.. but it is too expensive....dun think its worth unless you passby there to eat and not really went all the way there to try the food.
4
everything is wonderful just that my dish had toasts and they are not well toasted. too hard. wonder why it's like that.
4
Nice pleasant place. Food is good and unique! Healthy is the word. Place abit small thou, otherwise great place to hang out! Must remember to reserve!
4
Had heard so much about their brunch. Went down and was greeted by the enthusiastic staff!! Food were great however how I wish that the toast can be softer and fluffier. It was too hard for my liking. Overall experience was good!! will come back again!
5
So finally made it for breakfast and it was excellent. The music was too loud and the restaurant was empty but it was really good. We went and ordered on line and it has like either sashimi salmon or sashimi tuna with onsen egg on quinoa or other healthy carbo. The food was great and I felt great for being very healthy. Would definitely highly recommend this place
4
Singapore has plenty of options for brunch. I was looking something different then the gigantic hotel buffets, classic Asian or bene eggs (even I like all of it).I was looking for something I cannot find in Europe or hawker food in SG. So I went to Ninja Bowl. It was appealing to try a different fusion: Japan &a continental. I ordered the tsukiji bowl (tuna tataki with asparagus, edamame, pickles and tomato) and the fancy French (amazing French toast made with a soft brioche, fig jam, honey and fruits). All was exquisite !This hipster place is small, packed and vibrant. Be careful, take cash with you, no cc are accepted
5
Made a reservation to head down with a friend and was promptly shown to a table when we arrived. Service was great throughout, didn't manage to get a name but the waiter was extremely patient and helpful in recommending dishes to us, taking our orders and service throughout! Thank you for making our visit such a pleasant one. The food, as usual, is top notch and super palette pleasing. The only qualm is that there isn't enough to feed our hungry stomachs! Love ninja bowl, definitely a must visit!
4
I have a dairy allergy and each time i go down, the service crew never fail to go all out to help me look out and advice me on what I can eat. Food is always so enjoyable except the unagi pieces seem to be shrinking lol. Overall amazing, thanks
3
We had mentaiko egg scrambled on overly hard and tasteless white bread. Grain bowl is good but unagi is cold and full of bones. The service was ridiculous. How inflexible can one gets when the cashier saw our code but just would not let the rest of the long queue go ahead first? We were struggling to get the qr code although we showed the chope voucher that we had bought. We were frustrated and told him to get on with the queue and proceed with the order first. We even assured him we would be at the counter figuring out the code and without the food served, what loss can he suffer? There was a long queue and yet, he refused to continue the orders of the rest. How inflexible and a waste of our time during tight office hours
4
I have been here twice - tried ebisu and tsukiji. Will come back for more. Then again, it depends.. A friend that came with me thought that the food is too bland (of course, I don't agree =D). So maybe, if you prefer local strong-flavoured food, the bowls may not be for you.Perhaps the chilli cheese fries? This place scored lower for atmosphere mainly because it can get too noisy during peak hours mainly due to poor acoustic - but I came here knowing this.
5
Great menu and ingredients used were superb. Tried the Ebisu, Mentaiko Scrambled and Aligato Gozaimasu which were all fantastic.
3
Though there were quite a few options to choose from, it was an overpriced meal that wasn't filling.
5
First time trying out Ninja Bowl and it sure did not disappoint. Both dishes that we tried - Aligot-O Gozaimasu and Mentaiko Scrambled were tasty and satisfying. Will definitely be back
4
first visit to Ninja bowl. Service is quick and quality of food is appropriate for the price. Overall a good experience
5
Super affordable for the quality of food. Their new brunch items like the mentaiko scrambled eggs are scrumptious. Highly recommended.
4
Finally get the time to go down to try their food after seeing many great reviews. Tried Ebisu instead very good just that if portion is more will be nice. Coffee is good too. Will visit again to try other stuff on their new menu.
4
Not bad would come back. Scallop mentai scrambled egg was fluffy and light. Steak udon was also good and savoury.
5
Food was great, service staff is efficient too. Totally enjoyed our meal!
Location a little difficult to find. Finding parking was not easy too!
2
- Crammed and loud restaurant floor- Coffee was not fantastic- Food was mediocre- Slow service - to be fair, they only had one waitress at our time of visit/ unexcusable I finished my food way before my girlfriend's served (boyfriends beware!) - "un-honored reservation" despite reservation and arriving on time, I was told to get in the queu
4
first visit to Ninja bowl. beautiful interior abit of a industrial design.. ample space to walk even on a crowded evening. Staff is friendly and prompt to clear plates etc. from the looks of it, parking can be a little painful but nevertheless, good food awaits!ordered Ushi ( currently no on their web menu ) which consists of sliced beef. had to add one 2 bucks for rice grains. ordered their trademark Fancy French to go as well. overall, a pleasant experience with good food! the beauty of being a Ninja is that you enjoy no service charge
4
Dishes served are nicely presented and good ambience. Best dish is the genki ( which comprise of the Unagi)
5
My visit to Ninja bowl was pleasant. Staff members were friendly and ambience was good. Ordered from their new menu and enjoyed the scallops.
4
Generous bowl of goodies. The protein portion was generous too. Added the grain for my Kaisen bowl. Definitely can fill up a big eater. Looking forward to trying out the sister cafe Ninja Cut.
4
I got a tasting menu which was really value for money. Tried 2 bowls and a dessert and they were really good.
4
I love the Ebisu! Creamy but not overpowering, just so yums! Not a place to hang for long hours as the seats are kinda cramp. But it's worth it for a good quick meal.
4
kinda cramp and not very private since the tables are all cluttered with little spaces in between. there was an annoying housefly near the window too. amid all these, excellent food and service. ninja cut has a brighter atmosphere tho.
5
Our first visit to Ninja Bowl – Aisle is a bit narrow but we do like its industrial take of its interior design. Staff is as friendly as its Ninja Cut outlet.We ordered:Noka – Beef is well marinated, flavorful and tender as if has been slow cooked for hours. On its own, it is a bit salty for me. Suggest adding garden green (additional $2) and glad we did not. The sauce mixed well with those green. A wonderful dish! Sakara – We did not order the Sashimi set as we have a similar dish as Ninja Cut. A dish did not disappoint us. Sakara is a Salmon dish – just cooked nicely with the meat not dried at all.Both dishes come with scrambled egg. First look at the eggs, they look so similar to other cafes. Eggs taste great, either on their own and mixed with the greens. We suggest to make reservation if you intend to dine there
4
The place was simple yet felt very cosy. Food was interesting, the rice pasta was interesting. Ingredients were very fresh and good. The ebisu that i had, the sauce was creamy yet it doesn't make you feel sick of the taste after a few mouthfuls. Overall, a nice place to chill and have a nice chat with your friends.
5
Place was hip with nice decorations and furnishing. Even though it was slightly small and tables are close together, the atmosphere was still good for a couple.Food was delicious with a straightforward menu. Good size for the ninja bowls and would be sufficient for a dinner or lunch.
3
So so service, lots of waiters who each do very little. Indian guy (sry didnt get his name) who answered phone about reservation was rude! Overpriced even without service charge. Paid 130+ for 4 pple. Slow kitchen for food thats largely raw. Too bad because the food wasnt too bad. But not sure if wld come again esp during peak h
5
This was my second time at Ninja Bowl. The staff are very attentive and the food is delicious! I had the Ebisu which came with a generous serving of mussels and scallops. You can swap the toast for udon if you like.
4
Food were good and price reasonable. Second time visit , worth the money using choose voucher. Will come again
5
And it's a strike.
I'd be dreaming if there weren't any additional costs for rice, or lowered prices. But I reckon I'd be back anyway. Just not as often :)
5
Great place to hang out with friends or family, love the ambience (just not the overly bright spotlights). Food is simply delish and filling. A revisit is a must!
4
My 2nd visit. Love the Tuna Bowl & the Unagi with the Quinoa. Healthy & delicious. Order a piece of Mango cake. A slight too sweet. Overall I enjoy the casual environment & food.
5
I love the Ebisu and After Eight Cake to bits. The gravy for the Ebisu is really delicious, mussels and scallops are very fresh too!
5
We were there for dinner and we were impressed by the efficiency. We were served fresh food in no time. A good chunk of wholesome ingredients for a reasonable price with NO SERVICE CHARGE 👍🏼
4
Had too high expectations for their food due to all the raves and hypes of Ninja Bowl. Unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. Nonetheless it's still satiable.
4
Limited items on the menu but the food was well prepared and quality of food was very good! Bill is about 20-ish per pax.
5
I love the yasai bowl and the cauli pops totally worth heading down there to grab dinner after work ! Super appetising and won't leave you Super gelât !
5
I was blown away by the selection of choice and obviously the dish i picked was heaven's pick. The Ebisu is just right for any seafood lover! The cream sauce tastes best when it's served hot and warm.
5
The tasting menu was awesome. Great showcase and very value for money. Partner isn't such a fan of orzo but quinoa was great.
4
The cafe is easy to locate near Tanjong Pagar MRT at Duxton Hill. There was a crowd on a Sunday morning.

I do not recommend this place.Been seeing photos on Instagram and such and decided to try Ninja Bowl when Chope was selling their vouchers. It was a disappointment. Food was average. The steak in two of the bowls that we ordered was so salty and I couldn't even finish it. The staff that attended to us was really blur. Served the dessert before our mains came. Had to inform the staff to keep it and serve it after we finish our mains.

Heard about this place with raving good bowls as well as on instagram and decided to try it when Chope had the option of the tasting menu. Therefore, we went there to try the tasting menu bought from Chope. We made the reservations via Chope, it was hassle free and easy. Upon reaching, the place was small and was filled up as we went during a weekend lunch period. The crew who guided us to our seat does not seem too pleased, which spoilt the mood alittle. However, the barista, the other waitress and the cashier were nice and helpful. We ordered at the counter, with the tasting menu, on top of that, we ordered the poutine fries which was an entirely wrong choice. The beef above was oily and the fries at the bottom were soaking up all the oil, the beef was good but a tad too salty. The portion was too much for 2 as well, so dont order if u're just 2 small-medium eater. The appetiser that came next was great (Ebisu), and the best of all. The scallops were so well cooked and the taste of the ingredients were well mixed and delicious, we wished there were more bread for us to dip though. The main bowls came shortly after, we ordered the Unagi and beef cheek bowl. We regreted ordering the beef cheek bowl as the beef was the same as the poutine fries, we wished that the cashier adviced us that they were the same meat though. Therefore, we did not finish the beef cheek bowl but finished the unagi bowl as it was well executed by the chef. We chose the ninja rice for both, we had the tasting portion and felt that it was just nice for us. We dont think we could finish the full portion bowl if we would to order them. Lastly, the dessert (fancy french) came, it was so huge, it had 1 each. The mixture of the taste of it was unique but we didnt quite like it that much. The food served was definitely worth the price of the tasting menu. Otherwise, we wont go back again as the food is not exceptional for us. But if u're a health freak, do try it once

Service staff was friendly even though they were serving full house. Food was good though vegetables with better nutritional value would make the price paid more justifiable. I would not advise sitting near the door as the constant banging from the door closing got annoying after a while, on top of the noise from a full house

I tried their beef bowl at their pop-up at the National Gallery Singapore. I was pleasantly surprised that their portions were quite big and it was pretty good value. But I do think they can work on their flavor combination a bit. It's a little one-dimensional and flat at the moment, with no real mixture of flavors. But I think there's plenty of potential

This is my 2nd visit to Ninja Bowl, really love their food. Everything is yummy and innovative. The only grouse I have is the space. It's quite cramped and sometimes the tables are too close to each other. Good way to make guests mingle, but seeing that we have to get up often to put in order and pay up before getting our food, it's really quite a hassle squeezing here and there.

We went as a party of 4 and ordered 4 bowls and a drink each. The mains arrived pretty quickly and I had to say that the food was good and reasonably priced though I would have preferred a bigger portion. However, the drinks never came. So my hubby approached the counter not once, not twice, but thrice to remind them about our drinks. When we had finished all our food, the drinks were still nowhere to be seen. This really annoyed me so I approached the counter and told Nick that I would please like a refund since the drinks were not even on the way. He suggested that I could takeaway the drinks but why would I want to do that when I ordered the drinks to have with my food. So I resignedly told him to please prepare the drinks NOW and returned to my seat. Minutes ticked by and still my drinks were lost in the Bermuda Triangle. So my hubby went to Nick for the 5th time to remind them and only then did they started to prepare the drinks. Of cos, he was displeased and feedback to Nick but the reply we got was (in his exact words):" If you're unhappy, you can leave a feedback on Facebook". I'm appalled at this very poor service cos really, service plays an extremely important role in the entire customer experience. And no matter how awesome the food, I leave with a bitter aftertaste and can unfortunately only rate them "Terrible"

I bought the diners choice menu voucher worth $25 for 3 of their best selling items and it was really worth it! 1) the scallops and creamy bisque 2) flank steak with garden greens 3) french toast. Most were good but the toast can be less sweet! Nice cosy ambience but rather squeezy seating
3
The quality of the food is up to my expectations but the service needs to be more friendly. The Boss was having a bad day (I assumed), giving me the black face through my transaction with him.
5
Always enjoyed the rice bowls here. So tasty and fresh. Service is prompt and attentive too. This visit was to try the Diner's Choice tasting menu. Amazing quality for $15!
4
Healthy and delicious. Every thing was very fresh. I ordered the Salamanca bowl. It was perfect. Had the cauliflower pops as an appetizer. Would highly recommend.
4
Grains bowls are excellent however sides are unimpressive. Earl Grey lavender cake was bland. Very friendly staff.
5
The food here was great, and the portions were quite large. Definitely share-able for smaller eaters. And get the truffle fries if you're a fries person- the crisp was out of this world!
4
Love the concept of Ninja Bowl! The food are freshly made and we all had our dose of healthy goodness! Cheers to more veggies in our bowl~ :)
5
Bought 2 vouchers for the tasting menu and went with my partner last saturday. Pleasant experience for the value, taste of food and wonderful staff:)
4
Went for the diner's choice tasting menu. The portion for the main bowl is tad small but other than that it's worth the value. Loved the ebisu.
4
Fantastic food and service! The Ebisu was the bomb with fresh Hokkaido scallops and a tangy miso cream base. Would recommend the Genki bowl - the unagi was soft and tender and was complimented by a wholesome variety of veggies (loved the pickled beets). The tasting menu was a steal especially with the visa promo at $15! A pity I didn't get to try the braised beef cheeks which I heard is a hot favourite too. And their in-house bakes! Enjoyed the fancy french fig toast though it was on the sweet side and would do better if there was ice cream to pair it with. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating!

I never thought much about this place which was known for its healthy rice bowls, as I felt it was overpriced Economy Rice (Cai Png 菜饭), until recently I saw a 3-course meal offered by Chop. At $25, the meal includes a starter, a choice of main and a dessert, which I felt was value for money. Only cash and NETS is accepted here.Ebisu (ala carte $18)Pan-seared Hokkaido Scallops, Mussels, Miso Butter Cream and ToastIt was served pipping hot. The seafood was covered in a sea of rich creamy flavourful gravy, which I wished for more.From the 4 choices of main, I selected Tsukiji (ala carte $16)Tuna tataki, asparagus & edamame, onsen egg, pickled cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, furikakeI selected Orzo as my choice of base. There were other choices such as Ninja Rice and Garden Greens. The orzo ( a form of short-cut pasta, shaped like a large grain of rice) was topped with a savoury gravy and quite tasty on its own. The onsen egg added a rich creamy layer to the orzo. The asparagus was soft and crunchy. The pickled cucumbers was tangy and crunchy, while the tuna was smooth and fresh.Fancy French (ala carte $16)Fig jam french toast drizzled in ume-boshi infused honey, fresh grapes, plums, homemade hazelnut butter.This dish had a 20 minute wait. It looked quite pretty. The fruits was fresh and juicy, the toast sliced easily although I wished that it could be crispier.Overall the food was delicious. Best come early as the place get crowded easily, and could get quite noisy after that
5
The Tasting Menu is totally worth the price. Ebisu is so delicious i can't wait to get back to have it again!
4
Delighted to know healthy food is sprouting up everywhere and ninja bowl is one of the must try healthy eats.would come back again!
5
The service was excellent, the staff were really helpful even though we had a problem with an e voucher, and introduced the different items on the menu to us. Food was great as well!
4
I love the atmosphere. The staff were friendly and the food was great :) it's really filling though haha so come on an empty stomach!!!
5
Great Coffee, Great Food.
Friendly staff and good ambiance to chill!!
Its definitely a place to come back to!
5
Service staff - Prompt, helpful and friendly
Food - portion is just nice, ingredient are fresh, presentation is beautiful
Ambiance - clean and cosy
3
Delicious hearty food, very fresh but on the pricey side. The bowls are delicious; brunch items (I had the beef one) were average. Would visit again if I wanted to feel healthy.
3
We had the Kaisen (Seafood) and Geisha (Una gi with veg and hot spring egg) rice bowls. Food was great but it does not come with any base and to have a base (rice/ garden veg) is an additional 2$, which I found to be slightly strange. Other than that, food was great and will definitely revisit
4
It was a good overall experience; healthy food, good company and nice ambiance. Scrumptious meal of interesting blend of food. However the service attitude towards the end killed the experience when they were trying to get us out of our seats. Maybe a polite, direct approach would be more palatable? Cheers.
4
small place but good food and really friendly staff! healthy food and good range of food and drinks to order from. did not order the juices but saw others order them and its size is worth the money. no gst no service charge yay! initially thought i could design my own bowl though. thats the only con cause in every bowl there is an ingredient which i dont really like
3
Go for the brunch items and skip the bowls. Service is good, always happy to patiently explain which toppings go well with which choice of bowl.
3
Yasai was served with fresh salmon and omatoes! The Ebisu cream base was fragrant and milky smooth, scallops were large and juicy to the bite! Really enjoyed the meal in the quiet ambience on a Saturday evening.
4
First time visit the restaurant ,no gst and service charge,which make the price very affordable and reasonable
5
We had the Genki and Kaisen bowl and both were excellent. My only gripe would be that the price is a little steep for a bowl that does not come with any bases like greens or rice (which are add ons for $2).
4
Great healthier dining option. Staff were friendly. Would definitely recommend this place and be back for more!
5
Experience was great! Ninja bowls offers a great selection of healthy bowls - my colleague and I had difficulty making up our minds. Hence, a return visit is in the pipeline. Serving of food was quick - critical factor during the lunch time peak hour. Water is self-service and employees were polite and friendly in guiding customers through the operating model of the cafe
4
Came back again for the second time, and the food was still as great as the first time I went! Love how wholesome the food is, with the option of adding quinoa :) Stayed there for quite awhile, and it's definitely a great place to chill :)
4
Geisha Bowl and Fancy French were both excellent dishes that satisfied the palate and belly. A bit unfortunate on the cumbersome restaurant layout as the busy Friday night had a few couples squeezing but ultimately failing to get comfortable. I took advantage of the 50% offer - the prices would be rather high otherwise (spent $24 for two pax)
2
Perhaps Because I was using booking app chope my discounted priced French toast seemed smaller than usual. Also not sure why they are not using more comfortable chairs. May be space maybe cost reasons. I showed the cashier my booking via chope screenshot and still she charged me full price. I had to ask then she changed back for me. We ordered 1 salad and 1 dessert to share, the waiter put down the salad and walked away. We had to ask for 2 plates. Struggle to get simple and basic things right. Not customer oriented at all
5
We truly love our experience at Ninja bowl ever since we first stepped in this year. This is probably our 5th time here, and I like how they manage to pair up healthy eating, yet making it so tasty. What's best is the excellent service staff in the afternoon, and the nett pricing :
3
Got the scallop and muscle dish cos saw pictures of them in a delicious-looking sauce but sad to say it came in a puddle of oil. French toast was alright. I suppose Ninja Bowl's still a decent place to grab a quick meal.
4
A very enjoyable dining experience with great food and friendly staffs, price was very reasonable too!
4
The food options were great and delicious. If you have a big group, I would suggest for you to call in or use CHOPE to make reservations. The place is small, but the service is good.
2
The food may have been above-average but the visit was ruined right from the start by an utterly cheerless cashier. A person this unfriendly and arrogant really shouldn't be the one taking orders from customers.
4
OVerall good experience other than the price being a bit steep and the place could get on the noisier side during lunchtime.
Will be back for more definitely. :)
3
I ordered the Fancy French and was upset when i could smell the burnt toast before i was served. The toast came beautifully plated which was a thumbs up, but the edge of the toast was burnt, leading to a bitter taste. Perhaps in a attempt to cover the bitterness, my plate was drenched with honey unlike those i saw in photos where the honey was just drizzled at the sides of the toast. I really like the ume infused honey, but letting the toast 'swim' in them seriously make it overly sweet (to the extent of sugar coma). There was still so much honey after i finished which is really a waste. That aside, the toast was fragrant and i adore those fruits served with it
5
Food was really great and the waiting time wasn't long either! They were served pretty fast. Portion was just right for smaller eaters - without the addition of carbs. Came here twice consecutively because I loved the food so much!! Tried the Genki, kabuki, Kaisen bowl and gyu & tamago. current favs: Genki & kabuki!! Will def be back again to try the remaining dishes!!!! This place has earned its spot to be my top few go to dining places
4
Ordered Kaisen and Kabuki bowls during the visit. They give you choices of adding carbs or greens according to your preference. A well blend of palatable yet healthy bowl for the souls. Definitely a must-visit for the healthy gurus!The only downside was the fried items: (1) Cauli Pop wasnt exactly up to expectation after seeing many reviews raving about it. (2) Truffles Fries - cant really taste much of the truffles, more like normal shoestrings fries.
3
Avoid going for Saturday lunch in August 2016, full house. Was ask if we can finished our food by 13:30hrs as they have another reservation to cater to, dislike pressure since turn around time for seats is not part of my concern. Recommend walk in if possible, booking thru Chope limits your dining time severely as tables are assigned for booking. My order: 1 unagi bowl, 1 chicken bowl, 1 truffle fries, 1 hot ginger lemongrass, 1 lime coconut and 1 ume ginger. Food was healthy and yummy, recommended for those who love a balance diet (2 vege and 1 meat). Makes me think of overpriced economical rice. Waiting time for food was not long, about 10mins for rice bowls. Brunch dish - Fancy French was a 20mins wait. Drinks are over priced for coconut and ume ginger. Conclusion, subsequent visits have to seriously consider
4
One word of advice-if you are booking via the Chope app, pls call up the cafe to ensure that you have a table. We booked ours via that channel and there was a bug issue that caused the cafe to NOT have our reservation. Luckily we arrived before the crowd descended and managed to secure a table at the back. Food was not bad.. only thing is that the service can be a little cold (might be due to the multiple photos I asked them to help us take).. cheeky cashiers that gave replies such as "I'm not sure if any other places serve special water but we do provide water over there".. seriously dude. I did consider asking you to sprinkle fairy dust inside my friend's water if I wasn't so concerned in opening my presents. Overall it's an okay place to hang out with friends and chill without pressure that they will ask you to leave once you finished your food.
