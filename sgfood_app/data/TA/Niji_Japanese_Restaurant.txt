Our family is a regular here at this restaurant. Great food, super clean, reasonably priced, and most importantly - awesome service and hospitality!We would have a good conversation with the owner every time. She always took a good care of our daughter and watched her grow over the years. You will find satisfaction for whatever Japanese food you are looking for. Wonderful airy Izakaya

One lady is your total customer contact - greeter, hostess, waitress, and cashier! Check the lunch specials first including sushi. We ate here on 2 consecutive days and I enjoyed both the salmon and the mackerel. This is extremely convenient if you have business in or near the Concourse complex
