We had chicken and rice, shrimp roll , fried tofu and salt eggs veggie. All are good and portions just nice for 3 people.

Must-try for everyone visiting Singapore. Flavorful and carefully prepared local food at a most reasonable price. Highly recommendable.

Always come here when i come to singapore. Never miss a single time. My favourite hainan chicken rice in town. Chili tasted nice too

The chicken rice is very impressive!!
The chicken is so tender and juicy and the rice is cooked just right! Love the dark thick soy sauce and the chilli sauce!

I was brought here by my friends and very much enjoyed trying some different local dishes. Everything was tasty and the wait staff were very friendly. I would have liked to return before the end of my trip, but ran out of time!

Was deeply disappointed by the taste of the rice, not the fragrant rice I expected. Rice was tasting of fish.
The chicken however was reasonably tasty and soft but I expected more from this establishment.
5
The bestest chicken rice in Singapore. Authentic and super duper value for money! My husband and I always go here - it's a staple!
3
Went for biz lunch... Food is good.. but 3 pax at S$100+, lunch! Many better options! If you want good chicken rice and don't mind to pay.. this is the place.. but if you want value for $$.. there's better and cheaper chicken rice in Singapore

Excellent restaurant for those looking for good chicken rice, the east coast one rather small and not as big as balestier shop, but i like it because it is quiet and not require waiting. Food is equally great! But don't expect much service in this location. A must try for tourist but go to more centralized location. You can also buy the pack of chili for souvenirs

im writing for the east coast outlet. somehow i went to one outlet in bendemeer and they did not have the same food items? not sure about that. boon tong kee in east coast has always been one of my family's go-to casual diners. my favourites are: -roast chicken (usually sold out by lunch) -boiled chicken of cos.. -THE PICKLES (thats served with boiled chicken, but ill always order extra portion) -crispy tofu (and it's buddy -salad cream sauce)-yam ring-chilli sauce (MUST)on the whole food is nice, and have not failed us. but its dangerous, because i succumb to having more than one bowl of rice (carbs) :)

The chicken was good. The soup was a portion for 2 person but only costs $6. Cheap. Service was good too.
5
Through the hospitality of our host, we always ask him to bring us that this restaurant.
The steamed chicken is sooo good together with their ginger sauce.
I never fa Led to buy and bring back home their ginger sauce which is so excellent.
3
the chicken was tender and smooth. other dishes were good as well. the shop was in a surrounding with lots of eatery. happens to see another chicken rice restaurant just a few shops away with much bigger crowd.
5
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore steamed chicken was tender and juicy. Rice was fragrant. We had pork belly with preserved vegetables and it was good. Half chicken costs $13.
4
This restaurant was recommended by my hotel and they were right! The food here is good and very affordable! Recommended.

We frequently came to this shop for nice delicious juicy chicken rice over the years. Dishes on the menu such as the deep friend prawn cracker, friend tofu were among our fAvs. The staff looked weary. I guessed they were in the same jobs for decades.
5
We came on a late Sat afternoon (3pm). It wasn't crowded and the restaurant is clean. It's also air conditioned so that is a big plus point when we are with kids.Service is quick, our food arrived within 5mins from ordering. Tasty food with reasonable price. The steamed chicken is juicy and tender. The chicken rice is fragrant and even good to eat on it's own. Our kids definitely enjoyed the sweet sour pork (crispy and favorable).Overall we enjoyed the experience very much. We have found another favorite restaurant! Thumbs up

We had our reunion dinner at Boon Tong Kee. We had about 21 pax. Unfortunately they didn't have round tables, we made do with a rectangle (11pax) and a square (10 pax). It was pretty good too, the adults and toddlers sat at one while the teens at another. The menu they put together for me (by Lily) was great. My hubby's family members thought we were just eating chicken rice, they didn't expect we could order other dishes. For 2 tables with about 9 course, we paid about $600+ including 2 plates of abalone Yusheng! The sauce for Yusheng was abit too sweet, you can simply pour in half a bowl instead of the entire. Yusheng was good. We gave the 2 service staff a red packet each when they helped us with the Loh Hei. We were afraid the portion of food was small but to our surprise, it wasn't. We had leftovers so we packed them into boxes and ordered a box of chicken rice to go with. Service was good. Aircon was a bit cold, the staff did adjust for us later. We had a really enjoyable dinner. Family members were fully satisfied.Boon Tong Kee is a good venue as GV cinema at I12 Katong is just a stone throw away. We watched a nice movie after the dinner, still, with our family & extended families of about 30 people. It was a memorable evening for u

We enjoyed the chicken as it was fresh and very tender. The chicken rice was flavoured well and my girls enjoyed the rice. The rice was portioned well as we are small eaters. The fried beancurd was well fried and the inside remained silky soft. Overall a lovely lunch on a weekday where it wasnt crowded since we were there at 2pm.
4
I had a wonderful dinner time at this restaurant. I'm not surprise why you always got good review. Your chicken rice was great. Another favourite dish was the spinach with 3 kinds of eggs. Service was excellent. I'm waiting for next trip to Singapore and visit Boon Tong Ke
4
Very soft and succulent meat. Rice is fragrant and nicely cooked. Chilli sauce has just the right kick to the taste bud. Not too spicy. Overall, it's value for money if anyone wants a good plate of chicken rice
5
Been for lunch several times and it's always great. Order the medium portion of boneless and it's enough for 2. Fast, delicious, truly Singapore.
5
Chilli crab, garlic lala and marmite chicken are must try food! Have to wait a little for the food as the place is fully packed in weekends but it is worth the wait.
4
Great food as always but charging 30cents for tap water and another 20cents or more for wet towels is nuts. Be careful !
5
The taste of both Boon Tong Kee chicken and Tian Tian Chicken are excellent.The reasons I consider Boon Tong Kee better than Tian Tian are not about taste, but as follows:1. Environment. You have proper seating in Boon Tong Kee and being served, compared with hawker centre with self-serving.2. Dish variety. Boon Tong Kee serves way more dishes than Tian Tian with good quality.3. Opening hours. Tian Tian closes so early, while Boon Tong Kee got a longer opening hours

Ok. I know you'll agree... Chicken Rice is the best meal in Singapore. Nothing beats a plate of chicken infused rice with soft tender chicken (steamed white or dark brown soy). There are a number of versions that even include crispy crumb coated chicken.But no, with Boon Tong Kee, I will suggest you head for the pure white steamed chicken. The chicken so well steamed, it is tender at all parts. With light soy sauce so tasty, well blended with sesame oil and other fragrances to enhance the sweetness that is the chicken meat. The rice is cooked to perfection. Fluffy, yet stuck together by the awesome gravy. This is not your regular white rice. It's special. It is CHICKEN rice. So if you're looking for what may be one of the best chicken rice in Singapore, Boon Tong Kee may be one option.The only way to know? TRY IT. Sample now

Boon Tong Kee's Chicken Rice is at the level of Chatterbox of Mandarin Hotel. :-)But it is better overall, because:1. Good Service2. Reasonable Price (Far more cheaper than Chatterbox)3. Cosy & comfortable atmosphere*esp warm for Hongkongers because most of them know Cantonese.Worth trying
4
The sweet & sour pork was good. Others in our group got the chicken rice and liked it a lot. The wet towel packages were on the table and we had no idea there was a charge for them until we got the bill. Weird. It was very crowded but the service was good

Heard a lot about the famous Boon Tong Kee chicken rice in Singapore. Was in Singapore over Xmas and found out there was a branch close to our hotel at Katong. We walked to their shop house on east coast road and was pleasantly surprise by their decor. As a child, my memories of chicken rice stalls were mostly greasy and run down shacks( normally the best places for chicken rice ,in my opinion) but the Boon Tong Kee shop now has cute checkered table cloths.... Nice!The chicken was extraordinarily tender and soft. It came with a side order of their famous BTK chili sauce which was ok. The chicken was good enough on its own for me. As for the rice, it had the right amount of fragrance and texture. It was not at all greasy.Overall a very nice meal. The shop also offered other Chinese fare such as fish maw soup with crab meat and fried eng-Choy with belacan , both of which was excellent
4
We have tried more than a few dozens chicken rice stalls in Singapore, and always come back to Boon Tong Kee. A place for real comfort-food. Tender and tasty chicken, daily soup, home cooked style vegetables, fragrant and soft steamed rice plus mild ginger and chilli sauces. It is the perfect dish to tell me what is home
4
I was recommend to eat here from our hotel. We had chicken rice which my wife and I enjoyed. The restaurant was very clean the service & price were very good.

You can get same quality chicken rice any where in Singapore at a lower price.
Although the chicken is tender, it does not have a nice chicken aroma. Taste is flat, other than the sauces they add onto the chicken.
3
As the title, undeserved reputation! the food is soso for me, but the environment is good and clean, try if if it's near your accommodation.

If you want simple and great tasting Chicken Rice, go to this restaurant.
The rice is flavorful and the chicken is simple yet tender & bold in flavor.
Casual restaurant to enjoy with your family.

Location: Has quite a few branches throughout Singapore. However, the std of the quality of chicken rice is quite consistent in all its branches. What to eat: steam chicken n rice is the basic that all customers will order. Other than that, we like the steam eggs with crab meat, fried bean curd and spinach in superior broth. Price: Average about $15 per pa
5
i love it, its nearby my place, food's consistently good, and its always a satisfying meal (esp their chilli!!). katong folks are spoiled by the plenty of food choices around, and of course, chicken rice. aside from chicken rice they have a pretty decent chinese cooked food menu as well (you cant really go wrong with their dishes) , i particularly love their crispy fried beancurd. there are easily 5 good chicken rice shops. well each have their own fans, and my favourite(s) are: boon tong kee, katong shopping ctr's and nanxiang@tg ktg rd.

.. really enjoyed our experience at Boon Tong Kee. The restaurant was full so we had to wait maybe 10 minutes before getting a table. We were given a number which helped keep proceedings orderly. The food was Chinese with a south east Asian flavour (like the sambal green beans). We really enjoyed the 白切鸡 （white sliced chicken) and the eggplant with minced pork. The portion sizes were big. The staff were very efficient and drinks and food brought out quite quickly. Prices were very reasonable for Singapore.The table cloths were an interesting feature
5
Recommended by a Singaporean friend, it lived up to its reputation. One of the best Hai Nan chicken rice I've had - chicken was juicy and rice rich in flavour but not too oily. Other dishes were very good as well. Not in the most convenient location but would definitely be back
1
Singapore is the best place for chicken rice. You can find chicken rice with the same quality in almost every food court. Coming here is a must if you want to have chicken rice at "fine dining" price. The River Valley branch serve chicken rice with plate instead of bowl. Indeed a tourist trap
5
Would go there when we have a craving for chicken rice. Not only do they serve chicken rice, but also many side dishes which are good too. Their polular ones include the deep fried cripsy skin tofu, and the spinach with 3 eggs which we would always never fail to miss out. The chilli is also one of the best. (Chilli is one of the most important element in chicken rice) ^_
5
Authentic and Excellent chicken rice place - a must for chicken rice fans. I really enjoyed their chilli and ginger sauce.
5
It's delicious, affordable, and easy to reach by bus (the stop is directly in front of the restaurant!). One pf my all time favorite restaurants in Singapore.
5
It's a full restaurant. Famous for it's chicken rice - the chicken meat portions are usually quite small - so order larger portion. Their chilli is fantastic. Other dishes recommended are spinach with century and salted egg. Their deep fried chicken is also a hit.
4
The food is reasonably priced. Clean n comfortable seating. Staff friendly n cheerful. My friends n I liked their Deep Friend Tiger Prawn with Oats. It's exceptionally tasty.

Incredibly overpriced for chicken rice. A small plate for 1 person comes with half a chicken breast at 5 dollars. Ridiculous. The next price? 10 dollars for an extra chicken wing. Mad. And I hate that there is only one price for their products and not the usual small med large for Chinese restaurants that they used to. However a quality product that certainly can command these prices, the service and overall experience do not live up to the price. At the end of the day it's just chicken rice. Your just paying for the suit and tie that comes with it. There are better options out there.

I've got a long history of food in Singapore, and over the years 'Chicken Rice' has become one of my favourite dishes. I usually stay near East Coast Road, and my go to place for this dish used to be 5 star Chicken rice, literally a few doors down from this. I say used to, because when I came back this year, the quality at last mentioned place had dropped dramatically. Looking for a good alternative, I ended up at this restaurant. I was extremely happily surprised. The service is excellent (waiting staff very helpful and attentive) and the food...simply delicious. Very authentic still, while the restaurant decor and service has a more modern ring to it, but it goes well together. Very affordable as well. It is slightly steeper than the average 'hawker', but nothing too highly priced. For 30 singapore dollars you can eat more than enough with 2 people. Anyone who goes near this area I will recommend going to Boon Tong Kee, and whenever I'm back again I will most definitely return there
5
Of course the chicken rice was fabulous here, but I also wanted to say how great the tofu was. It was so silky and cooked just right. All the dishes were so good I couldn't want to go back again. Beanspouts seem like a simple enough dish but it was so flavourful. Highly recommended

When I asked my Singaporean friends about the best chicken rice in town, they always asked me back, are you looking for the best rice, the chicken, or the sambal? they said each shop has their own specialty.. since then I've ventured many chicken rice shops from the fancy ones until the hawker ones.. I think Boon Tong Kee is one of the best. Price is reasonable, I often order the chicken rice & their specialty: spinach with eggs, all in all it costs around SGD 20.50.I love the rice because it's fragrant & not too greasy, cooked to perfection. Their signature chicken is tender & not too salty. And their sambal is spicy enough (even for a chilli lover like me) but it won't overpower the taste of the chicken & rice when u have them together. I also love to add some extra ginger to the mix.Boon Tong Kee is available in several areas, so it's not some home-tasting, 1 & only, special kind of chicken rice, but it surely is delicious & recommended
3
Bad deal. Paid $25 over for a plate of hard boney chicken win and under cook rice. When I asked the staff why the plate consist of no meat but only chicken wings the abrupt reply was the it is the best part and I was given the best part of the chicken without asking?
5
I have been to this restaurant quite nearly every time I visit Singapore. Actually, there are lots of Chicken rice in Singapore but I quite like the local atmosphere even though the location is quite apart from town. Chicken here is excellent, service is much better than expected and have some more side dishes to order. I personally quite like chicken feet. After food, walking around that area which also have seafood restaurant, fruit market, shopping, small hotel and local Pub for drinking a bit after food
