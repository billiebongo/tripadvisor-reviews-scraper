Located opposite the many pubs at Clarc Quai this place is great because it serves good cocktails (e.g. frozen Margarita) and beer or half the price compared to the other side of the river. And the live music was really good as well ðŸ˜€

I've tried almost all the food on their menu, and my favourite has got to be their amazing burgers! The portions are really big and what I like about it is the fact that it comes with a kale salad and cajun fries. Imagine 180gm beef patties and 2 slices of cheese sandwiched by a lovely garlic brioche bun!The burgers are only $15++ and it feels healthy with the Kale salad! Chef Azlie serves up memorable food that will keep you coming back for more. I've been eating here nearly three times a week
