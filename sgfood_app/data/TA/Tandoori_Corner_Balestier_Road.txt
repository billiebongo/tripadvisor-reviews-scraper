We have been going in this restaurant for 3 years. Nether been disapointed. Cooking is always amazing. One of the best indian restaurant in town with a very afordable price! We love it!

The food at tandoori corner is really nice , i loved the food taste , especially when there is no India restaurant near by
5
Amazing Indiana food. And excellent service. We try a lot of dishes and everything was delicious!! But it open not all day long. Open hours 12-15 till 15-00 and from 18-00 till 21-00

I love this place and it's no exaggeration to say that a recent day trip to Singapore from Bangkok was heavily influenced by the desire to eat at the Tandoori Corner again. I waxed lyrical about this place before, but I'm happy to continue to do so, the food is magnificant, the menu is concise and the better for it, and the people are really nice. If you find yourself in the Novena/Balestier road area and hungry, I wholeheartedly recommend this place

The mutton biryani was fragrant and tasty, as was the butter masala chicken. The tandoori chicken was not as good - and very pricey. For $5 each - and some were small portions/parts, you could do better elsewhere
5
We visited this place on our trip to Singapore and just one word-awesome. We reached the place little late but the staff was really helpful and accommodating and was ready to serve us after the actual time of their closing. We ordered tandoori chicken and mutton biryani and both were really awesome . The place has a really nice taste in both the things . The taste was authentic Indian taste and the chicken as well as the mutton were cooked really well. Really liked the place. Thanks to the entire staff .

Happened to stay at Ramada singapore and was missing home style indian fix. Google helped me find this gem of a place just around the corner. Practically ended eating here every night. fantastic food, nothing exotic, regular menu one would find in Delhi restaurants, but very well prepared, the naan and roti's were better than back home. really saved us from staring in singapore

We stumbled upon this restaurant while trying to search for a good local Indian food outlet on the web nearby to our office. The reviews were very good so we were optimistic and headed to the restaurant. It was full and few minutes of waiting time. Very neat & clean, the staff are a combination of Locals & Indian. They have a set menu & Ala carte , though Set menu is light & filling for one person. Masala Chaach & Mango lassi are top notch. The food was just as home cooked as it can be expected. We liked it so much that the next day we ended up going to the same place for lunch. We get Papdams as complimentary with mint chutney that is just awesome. After one serving, if asked for more papdams are chargeable at one SGD. Ambiance is very good. Cost is reasonable too. Staff are very friendly. Keep up the good work..KUDOS!Everyday there is a new menu to keep the taste buds intact. :

It was OK for a lazy couple that was too tired to go to Little India. We don't have any Indian Restaurants near by so I think worth it.I tought that prices was a bit expensive comparing to Little India Restaurants and the size of portions was smaller.However the taste was very good. I recommend Strawberry Lassy, Mutton Curry and Samosas
5
We were introduced by friends to Tandoori Corner a few months ago and now we can't get enough of their amazing tandoori lamb chops. Prawn masala, lamb rogan josh, dal are other favourites. Great relaxed atmosphere and attentive service. Have been with family and friends and even organised a party there for 30 people. Satish and his team could not have been more professional and helpful and everyone we know who's been loves it
5
We ordered butter Chicken, chicken Tikka and Naan. me and my girlfriends like it and we sure be back for more.

My colleague and I were thinking of having lunch at a Chinese Restaurant when we walked past Tandoori Corner which is located at the first level beside the May Bank of Balestier Plaza and we decided to give it a try. We ordered garlic naan, chicken tika, aloo gobi (cauliflower and potatoes) and Murgh Vindoloo ( boneless chicken cube cooked in traditional vindoloo sauce). Seeing that we are Chinese, the staff advised us that the Murgh Vindoloo is very spicy but we decided to have this dish anyway. Indeed later, my colleague found the Murgh Vindoloo too spicy hot for her but I loved it. Halfway through our meal, the attentive staff who took our order came over and asked whether we were ok with our food. When my colleague said that it was too spicy, the staff went back to the kitchen and came back with creamy tomato sauce with butter for us to go with our naan. We were very impressed with the good service by the two staff whom I later found out that they are owners of the restaurant. We were glad that we changed our plan to have Chinese food to having Indian food as we enjoyed our lunch very much. Thank you, partners of Tandoori Corner (regret not asking for your names) for your excellence service and delicious good food. I will be back to try more of the many dishes on your menu.

Have been here with friends multiple time. I'm always amazed by how good the food are on every visit. I especially like the butter chicken that is perfect for a non spicy eater and the fresh baked and crispy nan they have. Owner and waiter are always very nice and polite. Definitely should give it a try if you're in the area
5
We almost walked by, but good job we stopped. Great food, true customer experience with lovely attentive staff, Amit was brilliant, nothing too much trouble and genuinely wanted to talk with you. Superb food and would definitely recommend as a must visit, 5 minute walk from the Ramada Hotel. Wishing the owner and staff all the best for the future. Mark & Sara

My husband and I always stop here for dinner on our annual trip to Singapore. This week we had dinner here twice. The owner and staff are pleasant, helpful and prompt. Both meals were delicious, with just the right amount of spice and seasonings.I recommend the Punjabi (yellow) dhal, aloo gobi and the veggie samosas. Delicious

I have eaten at Tandoori Corner a couple times over the past few trips to Singapore. I prefer to stay in the Balestier area when visiting Singapore, as the choice of food is great everywhere, and it is also a central area of Singapore without being as costly as other areas more common with tourists.What I love about Tandoori Corner is that it is located in Balestier Plaza, which is an older shopping plaza that is set back from Balestier Road, but not too far back. When you eat at Tandoori Corner, you are literally sitting on a nice veranda-style patio overlooking the road, but not too close that you are bothered by traffic and noise. You can still see people milling about and life passing by, and yet you are not right in the hustle and bustle.The food has always been of good quality when I have eaten there. I enjoy their naan (garlic especially), chicken tikka, sag paneer, dahl and raita. This combination always works well with a handful of diners present. Their mango lassi is also quite nice, but can be sweet, so do ask them to use less sugar when ordering.The price is typical for North Indian fare in Singapore. It is not inexpensive, but it is not pricey either, and for that reason I am more than happy to recommend Tandoori Corner to those who happen to be in the area and are craving North Indian food

The best experience we had in entire stay in Singapore from Dec13 to Dec 2016 was at Tandoori Corner.As it was close to our hotel IBIS NOVENA. Food & service was outstanding. their customer service how they treat their customers was great.will recommend for any Indian visitor to Singapore.Thanks Tandori Corner & specially Mr. Satish Kumar Singh-owner Tandoori Corner was such unforgettable experience
4
We ordered Chicken Biryani, butter chicken and garlic naan. All of them are so good. Butter Chicken - Tender tandoori chicken tikka cooked in a traditionalcreamy tomato sauce with butter. Chicken Biryani - Tender juicy chunks of chicken cooked with mild spices and Basmati rice. (Best biryani I've tried). Garlic NaanBread rubbed with fresh garlic and baked in tandoor. Two of us finished them all
4
This casual outdoor outlet serves North Indian cuisine, is one best tasting around. The owner and staff are friendly and professional, always checking with customers to ensure the food is great. We had tandoori chicken, curry fish, garlic naan, ladies finger and rice. All the dishes were sumptuous and tasty , as usual we had a very satisfying meal . If you are looking for good Indian food in central Singapore , this is the place to visit 
5
I'm a big fan of North Indian cuisine and this is my favourite place in Singapore. My usual fare is the samosa, the butter chicken, the prawn masala, the palek paneer and garlic naan, and briyani rice with onions, with iced tea. The owner and staff are really friendly. My kids (6 and 5) love the butter chicken here as well. It's really easy to park here
5
Excellent value for money. Their Aloo Parathas and Baigan Bharta was delicious. Friendly and efficient serviceüòäüòäüëç
5
I usually come here for the veggie platter which is delicious, Also the aloo gobi and tandoori chicken is great
5
Amazing food ....Good staff.....Excellent price.... Being a vegetarian I was worried if I will have good veg food there but they were totally awesome
Home food in Singapore
Highly recommended!!!

I find this place overrated in TripAdvisor. There is nothing extraordinary about the food dishes served here. I ordered tandoori chicken, rogan gosh, malai kofta and rice. Run up a bill of about $53. Not worth for the quality of food.

My wife had a craving for lamb chops, so a few seconds of searching on the internet brought me here. I have had tandoori chicken countless times, but tandoori lamb chops would be a first. The restaurant pops up at the corner of Balestier Plaza (hence the name). Seating is along the walkway. You might call this a local version of sidewalk al fresco, but not really. Not the most romantic of ambience but very quaint nonetheless. The colourful old Balestier shophouses right opposite the road are within sight so there is more than a hint of character to being there.The service is very friendly and personal. The staff was on hand to offer suggestions, but I already knew what I wanted.We ordered naans to go with a plate of tandoori lamb chops, butter chicken, and palak paneer.The palak paneer here is good. At some other restaurants, the paneer can sometimes feel rather fake (probably instant ones with artifical colouring, I dont know). But, here, they do this dish quite well. The spinach tastes fresh, and the texture is not too heavy. I truly enjoyed it.The butter chicken was smooth,¬† creamy and flavourful. And quite refined, I might add. I wonder though if one could actually ask for a spicier version.The lamb chop was indeed something special. The meat was surprisingly tender yet firm. The tandoori marinade that enveloped the flesh was done just right, with a mild tangy undertone. It was good as it is but perhaps the meat could have stayed on the heat slightly longer to get a bit more of the charring effect, just to give it an extra punch. To be fair, the meal was not cheap (particularly the lamb chops). Luckily, there was a discount for paying with a certain credit card. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I will definitely return. I am tempted to try other items on the menu.

First time visited this place as I always found the aroma when I was passing by. Menu was good , and easy to pick on , pretty straightforward for what you are looking for. I ordered the vindaloo and dhal, the taste was amazing as when you put it into your mouth although a small spoonful , flavours burst into your palette . It was very delicious! Of course do bear in mind that vindaloo is very spicy, it is not recommended for someone who doesn't like spicy food.Portion wise was not really huge but manage to get you filled up.Price is slight expensive but definitely worth the visit. And although the place is small and seems very casual the service there is exceptionally good. They really help out with food recommendations and check on you after the food is served. It's well worth a visit if you are craving for Indian food

The menu here was pretty extensive and reading thru other people's reviews, we tried some of their favourites:Onion Bhaji - my kids attacked this dish as its a starter. They loved it so much they even ate their deep fried curry leaves that was in it! Hubby said this was like extreme Muruku. Onion strips with Muruku coating! Must eat there, fresh and crispy!Butter Chicken - buttery and creamy and just delightful. My girl was practically drinking the sauce! Mutton Tikka - they didn't have it on their menu but this is a FAVOURITE dish of my hubby's and their chef very generously said yes. So they made that dish specially for him. It was also another hit with my children. Even I was impressed. I have tried many others and theirs was really one of the better ones. Rogan Josh - lamb chunks cooked in spicy curry. I swear mutton is not the easiest meat to handle and they do it right! And the curry sauces are seriously distinct from each other but still oh-so-yummy!!!Aloo Gobi - I was slightly disappointed when I saw their it was quite dry with no sauce. But the taste just knocked my socks off. Seriously one of the best Aloo Gobi I have eaten. I could finish bowls of this!Chicken Biryani - this was served in this deceptively small bowl with lovely spiced rice and tenderly cooked chicken chunks. My girls LOVED the chicken in this dish. And after many spoons of rice was eaten, the bowl still looked kinda half full!! Hub and I was so full after we finished the rice but no regrets there. Butter and Garlic Naans - this was another great dish. We ordered 2 first and then had to top up with another naan. Evident that my girls were just packing the naans away!!!We are seriously fans of this very understated eatery now. The service is swift and very sincere
3
Have had some good meals at this small North Indian eatery but for the fast 1 and half year their food quality has been deteriorating.Today's biryani meal was the last nail in the coffin. It was probably the most oily Biryani I have ever had in my life and yes, i am a biryani fan and can make out when i get anything close enough to be called a biryani.I might go there again for their gulab jamoons but no more oily fried rice with indian spices in the name of biryani for me
4
So no MRT is close to this place, but there's good connectivity by bus. But then it depends on where you're coming from. We were travelling from Dover Rise and had to change two buses. The food is good although the portions are smaller as compared to the ones we get back home in India. We ordered Dal Makhni, Chicken Vindaloo and rotis. All of it was pretty decent and the restaurant was easy to find since its in the corner of a pretty huge building.
5
this place does the most delightful tandoori lamb chops and is worth a visit here from where ever you are in Singapore to try them. rest of menu decent but the lamb chops are a show stopper
5
I happened to try Indian food at lot of Indian restaurants in Singapore. But by far the best vegetarian food.
5
I spent several months in Singapore trying new food and Tandoori Corner is one of the best Indian food I¬¥ve ever eaten. I highly recommend it, the service is excellent.Try "tandoori lamb chops" & "tandoori chicken" those are the best. For drink I recommend a Tiger beer, if you don¬¥t like alcohol, try the lime juice
3
This little place with no indoor seating is cheap and tasty likely accounting for its good rating. Curry of small portions around $11. Basmati and naan around $3-5. The curry flavours were good but lacked complexity. The vindaloo was hot, and butter chicken sweet. The onion basmati was excellent
4
We live close by and walk down to Tandoori Corner when we're in the mood for some great Indian food.The food is consistently good, the beer is cold and the service is swift! Always walk away satisfied
5
This restaurant is at a walking distance from Days Hotel and Ramada Hotel. It is an open air restaurant right on the edge of Balestier Plaza with quick service and amazing Indian food. Dal Makhani of this restaurant is simply awesome.It is also quite popular among both Indian community and Non-Indians living in that area as it is frequented by both.The restaurant is best place to go if someone staying in Novena area is looking to get authentic North Indian food without having the need to go to Little India. I always go to this restaurant whenever I am staying in Ramada.Pricing of the food might look expensive to some but then things do not come cheap in Singapore !
3
The food was average the seating was OK for this kind of a food joint, but the main disadvantage is that the wash room is quite far from the restaurant, they did allow us to wash in the basin they use, but that seemed so uncomfortable
3
At the time of writing, 54 people left 5 star ratings, 19 of which were left by reviewers with only 1 review. Curious? You be the judge. We came here due to the exceptional reviews on the food. Turns out to be just another mediocre joint serving average Northern Indian food. Nothing to shout about. Many wrote about excellent service too but that was not the case either. To be fair it's a very casual joint & you shouldn't expect much in terms of service. Service was acceptable, but they didn't seat us eventhough we notified them of our numbers and we were busy with our baby. We had to seat ourselves at any available empty table. Long delays between dishes and it took forever for them to come and take our order. Slightly pricey for what it is. Our usual haunt for Indian is a proper air conditioned nice restaurant in the heart of the CBD, and the prices are in fact a bit cheaper than Tandoori Corner.
3
this place is kind of an average Indian food the quality of food is okay but the prices are on the higher side maybe because there not much Indian restaurant nearby. it's at Shaw Plaza . The portion size of the food is also okay but on the contrary the taste is not up to the mark. The quality of service on some days are good but when they have high load on they seem to deviate .The Owner of the restaurant is a nice man and he provide good service 
5
We had the lamb chops, butter chicken and naan. Everything was so delicious. Very authentic, comparable to the food we had in India. Definitely will be back for more
5
The food was excellent and the service was good. MUST COME HERE TO TRY!! Come and eat their fantastic butter chicken. Pair it with a delightfully sinful butter and garlic naa
3
Few months back we dined at tandoori corner. Ordered Naan and paneer butter masala. Nana was good and soft. But the paneer was so hard. The gravy quantity was also less. May be can dine once or twice but not so frequently.
5
My husband came to take away some chicken tikka, naan,samosa, chicken biryani and a pack of curry. I love it so much that we went back two days later for more. Excellent curry texture and taste. Highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Have been here now 3 times and always great food and great taste. Having lived in Mumbai for 3 years I know how Indian food can taste
5
I leave nearby and we come regularly with my wife, mainly for dinner. Service is quick and smiling, the boss always there, and the food is really better than much more pricy indian restaurants downtown. We have never been disappointed .Parking in the same building is very easy as well. Strongly recommende
5
Beautiful food, great value and the owner makes everyone feel like a VIP. Located a fair way from the city but close to our hotel Ramada at Zhongshan Park. I suggest giving Little India a miss and trying this place
4
Found this little gem several years ago and it never fails to please. The owner is unfailingly friendly and greets every guest.The seating is basic, outdoor and there's a close view of busy Balestier Road but it's the food you come for.....Small bowls of utter decadence. There are so many must-try items on that menu that it cannot be done in one visit. Highlights for me are the onion bhaji, makhni dhal, bhindi masala, saag paneer and always the naan. Wash it all down with an icy beer.Mmmmmmm, mouth's watering
5
You don't come here for the atmosphere (you eat outside on a busy street), But if you can overlook that be prepared for the most mouth watering, amazing Indian food in Singapore. We return again and again. The lamb is succulent, all chicken dishes tasty and authentic. We love the rices too. Food is prepared quickly, but is fresh, and tasty. Service is great. Prices a little high for the area, but the meal is worth every dollar.
5
This is the place in Singapore for unpretentious, affordable, and slam-bang-great North Indian food. Our new favorite place in Singapore.
4
Let me start by saying that the Naan here is superb! Light and flaky, and not the least bit doughy. The owner was nice enough to come around and check how everything was going, and the service crew are also attentive, clearing dishes as soon as they are finished. Well worth a visit if you like this sort of food! Prices are about average of what you'd expect for a restaurant in Singapore
5
Called with my wife and daughter last night. Excellent curry. I will be eating there again on my return journey. Naam bread was especially goog
5
I am a regular patron of the restaurant as this is the best North Indian food my family have tasted. We usually order Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken Masala, Chicken Tikka, Prawn Masala and the Lamb Korma. The service is also very good and the price is reasonable
5
The best Indian restaurant in Singapore for Punjabi food. We had ordered for paneer makhani and naan and veg biriyani. The taste is undoubtedly Punjabi just like what we get back in india. After having a tasteless food at different veg restaurants in Singapore this was the welcome change. It's very near to Ibis Novena and other hotels on balestier road.The seating is outside and basic but that's ok for a small joint. The reason I am ready to ignore the seating is the care n courtesy of the staff the owner. It was late they were about to close but they made us feel comfortable and waited till the time we completed our dinner and drink
4
Loved the preparations. The vegetarian food is awesome, very fresh and nice. We also ordered butter chicken and it was good too. The staff is very quick. Perfect if you want to have Indian food at the end of the day. The seating is basic and outdoor. But it seems to be a very popular joint amongst the locals too. We visited the place twice and were happy with the food on both the occasions. It offers great tasting food. But not too great in ambience. It opens only at 12 noon and thus not an option for breakfast
5
Fantastic food in a really nice outdoor environment that allows you to sit back, relax and watch the world go by. The menu is a relatively short affair, and the food all the better for it. Staff are extremely attentive without being intrusive, all in all a really nice casual dining experience
5
Tandoori Corner is a casual setting where you can watch life passing by on Balestier Road whilst fans keep you cool. The food is delicious and good quality ingredients prepared by a great chef. Our favorite to eat is the Peshwari Nan with everything on the menu! Also the Onion Bhaji is a great way to start your evening!
4
What a surprise; Great North Indian food, all freshly made, outdoor seating, fast and correct service, will visit again
5
A treat for those who love Indian cuisine. Being from India, I felt like home here. Very good service and excellent food
5
I stumbled upon this place sometime back when I was looking for a place to have my lunch. To my surprise, it was wonderful. Back then I ordered a mutton briyani which for me is the real test for good Indian food and it was out of this world. The rice was fragrant, soft and not oily. The chunks of mutton imbedded in the rice was tender, juicy and flavorful. The staff manning this restaurant makes it all the more better as they are attentive, polite and remember you with every visit. Since my first visit I have explored many other dishes like their naan, butter chicken, vindaloo, bindi masala, fish tikka, etc. There is no fault to find in this place. Although it can get a bit warm sitting outside, they will always accommodate you with an electric fan. This place is a must go for North Indian
5
we live just across the road and when our lease was up this place was actually one of the reasons we decided to stay in the area! just amazingly perfect food. we eat here probably once a fortnight and bring friends and visitors from abroad, all of them love it. sure, you've got to sit outside but who cares? they have many fans to try and make you as comfortable as possible. you don't come to balestier road expecting fine dining! the fish tikka is absolutely delicious and i literally dream of the aloo gobi. salivating now... perfect for a low key dinner but i sometimes do wish they had more tables as it gets busy
5
Its near to Fragrance Hotel (Balestier Road), so went in there and since then I don't even bother to go and look for other Indian Restaurants. Absolutely Authentic Food with nice service.. I was there for 6 nights and went daily.. That's the level of food. Must taste the food. Worth every penny.. Just go for it. Kudos.
5
If you want to eat tasteful and delicious Indian food Tandoori Corner on Balestier Road is the place to go. Highly recommended.
5
Read good reviews on this place before we left OZ. did not disappoint. Great authentic Indian fare in an alfresco style resturant. I especially liked the tandoori chicken and the butter chicke
4
A very inconspicuous place (outdoor seating only), but serves some really tasty Indian fare. It's a small team of 4-5 gents, and it is a real value for money restaurant in Balestier area. We've been staying in this area for a while and have already visited this place more than 5-6 times.The staff here adds a personal touch each time you visit them, be it adjusting the pedestal fan to your convenience, or suggesting a few dishes for you to try, or coming up with a good, healthy conversation if you're up for it!Coming to food- this place serves great, economically priced dishes. Butter Chicken and Lamb Chops are a MUST TRY!Also try there Malai Seekh Kababds and Butter Naan.Average price for main course dishes is SGD 12-16, so a good meal for 2 would cost around 45-50 all inclusive (assuming a starter, 1 main course gravy dish, breads and soft drinks)...A great neighbourhood dining outlet...definitely worth trying if you are looking for a simple change, or for regular visitors- a welcome change over the weekend.While they do not have enough staff to accommodate home delivery, you can call them to keep your order ready for take away and then collect it on the go.
5
Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken Curry are highly recommended. Order Peshawri Naan as desert and it's a perfect end for the meal. Over all, food is very tasty, outdoor seating is enjoyable and price is reasonable (only soft drink is a little bit pricey.
4
A good nicely done indian restaurant at Balestier Plaza. Curries and salads are good and prices are reasonable. Outdoor seating and the staff is nice and suggests you how the curries will be before ordering .... The restraurant closes at 9:30 pm , we missed it one of the days but made sure to hop in the very next day as we were staying in Ramada on the balestier road which was walkable.... Overall, for indian food lovers staying near balestier road - this place can offer you some really good stuff at an affordable price with an Indian touch....
4
We were a family of 3 who were visiting Singapore on a vacation. We were put up in Ramada Hotel at Zhongshan Park which is about 400 mts from this restaurant. I had searched for restaurants near to our hotel in advance and had found this one.This is a nice restaurant with good and authentic Indian food choices like dal, rice, paneer tikka malasa, chicken tikka, butter chicken, rotis, butter nan etc although we found this restaurant to be a little on the expensive side (atleast 20%-30% more) compared to the Indian restaurants in Little India.Food taste is really very good and the best that we ate in all other Indian restaurants in Singapore in a period of 6 days
5
Friendly attentive service and reasonable fresh food - recommend the Butter Chicken and Onion Bhaji to star
5
Found this place via Trip Advisor and decided to try it out while I was in SG on business. Had a great time there Amit took very good care of me both nights I went for dinner. Rogan Josh was outstanding and the Fish Curry he suggested was just as good. I've missed having quality Indian food and this place hit the spot! Thank you

Excellent northern Indian food. Must haves:- tandoori prawns, rogan josh, butter chicken, bhindi, prawn masala, fish tikka and end off your meal with 2 sugar balls called gulab jamun. Reasonable pricing with excellent service. Ask for Ami
5
Hotel staff directed us to this place when we were looking for Indian Foods. This is absolutely an amazing place if you love Indian foods. All the things we ordered were delicious and the staff members were very welcoming .
4
Visiting Singapore from Australia, it was my daughters first time eating Indian food and could not have been a better experience. Amit and the staff made us feel very welcome and the butter chicken with naan bread was a winner! Look forward to trying their restaurant in Leichardt Sydney
5
First time at this restaurant, excellent service, attentive staff were all friendly and very courteous.The flavors of the food bursts in your mouth and is simply scrumptious.Keep up the great work
5
Ive been staying around balesteir road for a year now and not a week goes by when i am not craving the deliciously homefelt food. The menu is diverse and attracts all nationalities. It is very accessible and a great place to take your friends and family for a healthy food option made from the heart. The staff are extremely warm hearted and friendly. My special mention to Amit who welcomes all customers with a bright smile and takes good care. My personal favorites are the veg thali and veg biryani. Ive also tried their bhindi masala and palak paneer which are amazing and standard item which i order whenever i visit. Recently i tried the aloo paratha served with chilli paneer which was delightful and will be added to the menu soon. So if ur thinking of trying out a new affordable place with great food, you have found it!

We had dinner at Tandoori Corner tonight, meeting up with a friend on our last night in Singapore. The curries were delicious and we were really impressed that the vinadaloo we asked to be made spicy was actually spicy. (So many times we request curries to be made spicy at other restaurants and they come out bland.) The waiters were attentive, the lassi was delicious, the naan was nice and crispy. Altogether it was a good night out
5
Xcelent freshly prepared Indian food served wid warmth n heartful Indian Ness :))) thumbs up to tandoori corner n a must must try in Singapore
5
We discovered this restaurant while waiting for our coach from Singapore to KL. Very tasty preparations at reasonable prices. Excellent service. A must visit if you are looking for a real North Indian fare in Singapore. Can't wait to visit Singapore and visit this restaurant again
5
This place I found near to my stay in Singapore i.e.@ Balestier Street, Its having great quality of food even the taste is perfect and at its best.. loving it... Butther chicken and Dal Makhani is very Yummy with Garlic Naan and Pudina Paratha... Also must say the Person serving the Food are very Cheerful and attentive, well-dressed. Specially guys over there , Amit and Aman Singh are very attentive and sincere one.Once you are in Singapore.. Must try this place... Tandoori Corner... At Its Best.... Yoooo...!!!By--Vineet(Delhi

The food tastes very authentic Indian and is just awesome !!! Must visit ....... Also the food quality and service is commendable .....
5
Went there based on TA reviews and was not disappointed! Very good food and quick service. Not a fine-dining restaurant, but great cheap indian. It's strictly outside seating so no A/C, they do have a fan that helps so it wasn't too warm, at least not at night
5
Tandoori Corner is a hidden gem in Singapore! Food and service at Tandoori Corner are both amazing. The food is fresh and light - not the usual heavy Indian food that one would expect. Service is fast and the staff is friendly. It's amazing food at a very reasonable cost. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious authentic Indian food. My parents (who were visiting from Canada, but are Pakistani) said it was literally the best Indian food they have ever had in a restaurant. Give it a try :
4
I had been to Tandoori Corner for lunch in years past when I used to visit a local office. They have a great lunch special. This time I was there for dinner. I was divided in my mind between XO chinese fish just down the street and Indian and the Indian won out. I had a larger helping of their lamb curry that I used to enjoy for lunch and it didn't disappoint. They have wonderful hot breads and a good menue. I only just got a table, there were several reserved already and the restaurant filled up right after I got there. Its all seating on a patio with a lot of it outdoor so you might find a much smaller venue if it rains :) I wouldn't call it the best Indian in Singapore, but thats quite a high standard, its a nice family place with good fresh food. (dont forget the lunch special

My husband and I have eaten here twice and both times the food was lovely and the service was great. We had quite a few things on the menu and everything was delicious. One of the few restaurants with affordable wine

I went to Tandoori Corner a couple times a week for lunch, for the two months I was visiting family in Singapore. The food was consistently delicious and the lunch set meal was a great value. Mr. Amit was always a friendly and polite host. The shaded outdoor seating was very relaxing. Highly recommended

We stayed at Days Hotel Zhingshan Park Singapore . During our stay we use to visit this resturant daily for breakfast ! Food was nice and Pranthas was good . But you really dont have variety of food there. but it's good for enjoying breakfast daily,
5
We went to Tandoori Corner twice during our visit to Singapore - once for lunch and a few days later for dinner because our first experience was so good. The food is fresh and tasty, and the mango lassies are freshly made. The service was fast and our waiter was very friendly and attentive, so it was easy to ask for extra naans/rice and get the bill. Overall, you get a great meal - much better than a lot of the more expensive restaurants. The location isn't the best, but it's not the worst either. If you're looking for a quick and excellent meal, this is the place to go if you're in the area

I have been here plenty of times and I was always fulfilled. The outdoor seating was lovely, the service was great but most of all food was very wonderful and delicious. Do not fail to try the tandoori prawn, butter chicken, dhall makhani and garlic naan
3
This place came highly recommended, so maybe my expectations were too high.Likes: Butter chicken excellent; outdoor seating; service friendly and helpful.Disliked: lamb rogan josh had little depth of flavour and was if the lamb was only introduced to the sauce just before it was put on the plate.I'm going to put that down to us eating quite late - they were preparing to close up as we left,So, I would give it another go
5
Stumbled upon this place as we were staying at a hotel nearby. I ordered 2 tikka spicy, Dahl makhani, garlic naan, and rice.The tikka was PERFECT. Very tender and juicy. Nice and spicy (you can get non spicy also).Naan was lovely as was the rest of the meal. Service was great

Highly unprofessional for catering purpose.Quantity of food provided was not enough for the number of people decided.Rude attitud

I went here after reading all the reviews on here and got exactly what I expected; great service, great food and a seat outside. I would absolutely go again.

This restaurant was recommended to us by my Father who lives in the area. From the outside, it's very unassuming, looks a bit like a shopping centre takeaway but it didn't disappoint. The food and service were very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful, they set a larger table up for us (party of 5, 2 adults and 3 children) and the service was quick. We ordered a selection of different dishes to share, all were delicious and piping hot and not too spicy for the children. The prices are very reasonable, cost approx $100 SGD for 5 of us which is great value as the portion sizes were generous. The only complaint I would have is there is no option to sit inside but that's a tiny gripe and it wouldn't stop me from going again, would definitely recommend this restaurant

First time visiting this restaurant after reading the review from trip advisor.Firstly food, the food and the presentation of food is good.the price also very very reasonable for the portion and quality of the food.Next,the service staffs were quick and also handy in recommending the dishes and ensured the order was right and the food met our expectation.Now the ambience,you can't expect a classy fine dining setting.They only have outside seating in balestier outlet,but it offers a different experience rather than the normal standard dining seating offered in other Indian restaurants.the place was very clean and comfortable.Overall,Me am my wife enjoyed the dinner.Will definitely visit this place again

We live locally and had read good things on Trip Advisor about this place. We are always keen to find good neighbourhood restaurants, so we went for a meal with high hopes. The rice was greasy, the prawns no more than average and there was very little ambiance because the seating is all outside, facing Balestier Road. Service was adequate, no more. We had high hopes; sadly they were disappointed.
4
We just live around the corner and gave this small place (outdoor sitting only) a try some time ago, which we didn't regret. The food is splendid, authentic and fresh. Service is very friendly and really cares about the guests on the few tables (our glasses or naan-baskets were never empty for more than a few minutes and the waiter as well as the chef did show up at the table to ask whether everything was alright, something happening in Singapore quite rarely (even in the upper price segment...). Unsurprisingly, we came back several times and hope to be enjoying dinners there in the future

well, went there on wifeys bday coz I wanted to take her to a place which serves good but not exorbitantly expensive food.It didnt start off well as I was taken aback to not find inside seating. It is a place with the tables outside in the Balastier plaza complex, with food being served from inside. While it was hot outside (around 31-32 degrees), they turned the cooling fan towards us. Thankfully they had a baby seat, so my daughter was alright.After a quick round of taking the order, and sprightly working staff, then came the food.JUST WHAT I WOULD WANT TO have!... excellent butter chicken (reminded me of my Dilli), garlic naan, parantha, kadhai paneer, roganjosh !The Makhni daal was about there, but not quite the standard (I am not easily pleased on this front, so you can pardon me)The staff was very responsive and swift right from the word go!Food was great enough for me to pack it and take away, but alas, I do live a fair distance from the place.In all, I would definitely recommend a visit when you want great north indian affair without the fine-dine feeling attached with it.Cost per person came to be about SGD $30-35 pp

Positioned in a local outside arcade at 01-12 balestier rd gives it an authentic local friendly feel; food was fresh and very good at value prices in the suburbs polite friendly service

Amit and I had dinner at tandoori corner 2 weeks ago and ordered ‚ÄúMURGH VINDALOO‚Äù it‚Äôs awesome! Very clean restaurants that I've had the pleasure to dine in. The whole staff, from the management to reception, conducted themself in a proficient manner. I very much impressed with their style and behavior
5
Had visited the Tandoori corner at Balestier Road last month with my colleagues during my business trip to Singapore. I had ordered a Fish Tikka, Murgh Vindaloo, Makhni Dhal, Vegetable Biryani and Butter Naan. The food was really fresh and tasted delicious. The spices were just perfect. The ambiance of the place was really soothing and relaxing. I would be more than happy to recommend this to anyone
5
Each and everytime my workmates and i crave for Butter chicken, we have no other choice but to grab a cab and head to Balestier Plaza. Tandoori Corner serves really excellent butter chicken! We also love the outdoor setting, very casual. We usually take the set meal which is a great value for money considering that the food is really good. Service is very quick. They won't let your tummy be grumbling for so long. :)I highly recommend Tandoori Corner and i look forward to another fantastic dining experience
5
The place is fairly unassuming by the side of Balestier road, but the food is awesome.
We especially like the garlic nan breads which are done to perfection, the prawn masala and the black dahl. But we've never been disappointed with anything on the menu.
5
Until now, i cannot find better chicken masala than Tandoori Corner's.It is succulent, just perfect amount of spices and the portion is just nice.Better to have dinner there rather than lunch due to the hot temperature in Singapore.They should have some indoor seats

Last week, during my business trip to Singapore, I visited Tandoori Corner. This restaurant was referred by one of my close friend who had already been there. The food at Tandoori Corner specially the Samosa was wonderful. The food was very authentic in taste. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They not only helped me with the menu card but also served the food in no time. The ambiance is decent. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends, who are visiting Singapore. Well Done Tandoori Corner Team. Keep it up

I visited Tandoori Corner on 7th January with my family during my family vacation trip to Singapore. I was searching for authentic Indian taste in Singapore. I heard about the Tandoori Corner from someone in Hotel and decided to visit the place. It was fantastic place to be in. As soon as we entered the place, we received very warm welcome by the staff in the hotel. We felt homely in a foreign country. Being pure vegetarian, we were looking for good vegetarian options. The staff helped us place order according to our requirements and taste. The ambiance and service was great. Within reasonable time, the food was served. Wow!!, the food was really great. The Samosa, Dal Makahani, Paneer Kofta and Nan were really very very tasty. After a long time, we had such a great Indian food that too in Singapore. I would really refer this place to all my friends and relatives visiting Singapore

This little gem is more cafe than restaurant but don't be put off by the casual ambience. The food is fantastic and the staff were simply wonderful - we couldn't have asked for better service. We'd read that the Samosas were a 'must try' and we agree - they were superb. The Onion Bahji were great too. We shared Tandoori Lamb Chops (mmm-mmm), Saag Paneer (a bit lightly flavoured for my dining partner but I enjoyed its delicacy) and Garlic Naan, along with plain rice. A very tasty meal and good value too. We did briefly wonder if there may have been MSG in the food as we are both a bit sensitive to it and felt as though we may have encountered some - but can't be sure. In any event, we would love to eat there again - so many dishes to choose from - and would just double check that no MSG is used

Hi Aussieexpat, I'm a Kiwi. I live in the building just behind Tandoori Corner. Kememan Point. We're neighbours. Been going to Tandoori Corner for 3 and a half years now. Save it for special occasions, often take a big group. Next trip is my birthday feed. (No pressies please).Not an expert on Indian food, but I know what I like and I do enjoy the food there. And my friends tell me it is great, so I guess that seals it - see FW Deschweppes review - a mate. Surrender, the owner, often recommended for me in the past and now I know my favs. (Deschweepes also tells me what to eat and he is an expert on food of all sorts). Surrender even made up a chef's special for us one time.I pass by most days on the way home from work. Always big hellos, hugs, friendly pratter, big smiles - get the same when we eat there obviously. Makes us feel special to be treated so warmly when we patronize the restaurant. Maybe it is because we have got to know the people at Tandoori corner. Also like about the service: I barely finish a beer and I am politely asked if I want another. (I usually say 'yes'.)I also like the outdoor atmosphere, even when it rains. Get to watch what's happening on the street - usually lots - it is nice sitting under the veranda when it rains. Like an outdoor cafe. Big fans take care of the air circulation when it's hot and humid.Philosophy time: I guess the real point in writing this was because I was surprised by how all of us can see things so differently, even when we have the same basic experience from basically similar cultural backgrounds. Sorry you didn't enjoy it. Try again. Tell them you know John, Jane, David and Mary from New Zealand.Take care

We absolutely love this local restaurant, very clean, friendly service and the food is absolutely incredible. Very good quality meat cuts and a nice outdoor environment. Cannot believe it's so reasonably priced. We highly recommend the garlic naan, lamb chops, butter chicken and onion rice - in fact you can't go wrong with anything on this menu. We go at least 2-3 times a month :-) and we have organised for 40 friends to celebrate our anniversary with us here this year

We came here for the first time for dinner as it was located just outside our condo. The food is average & pricey compared to what you get. The atmosphere is terrible (open air/no air con) & the tables/chairs are quite basic. The staff is not professional & quite rushing. We were given the bill even before finishing our drink & the staff came to push you to settle the bill quickly. Such an awful experience!! We will never go back there again!!! Many Indian restaurants around Racecourse Road to choose from with better food, service & value

Tandoori Corner @ 5 Boon Tat St is HIGHLY RECOMMANDED too all indian food lovers.Apparently this is a new restaurant located at boon tat st.My collegues and i often go there for lunch, where they have amazing lunch deals starting for like $7 per person.based on my experience, i decided to bring a bunch of my cousins over there for dinner,it was all ladies. All of us at an enjoyabl night. we were stuffed with great food and wine.pricing of the dishes are very much affordable than any other restaurants i have frequented. the service was warm and the team was very accomadating to our requests.Off all the food we orederd the best were - Onion bhaji, chicken tikka, fish tikka,rogan josh, butter chicken and papdi chaat.i will suggest whoever goes down to tandoori corner to give this dishes a try they are simply yummy more to home cook food.i will defintely go back for many more delicious food
5
What a delightful surprise -- this recently opened restaurant more than met my expectations (not that I am such an expert on Indian food!). My friends and I had a dinner of about eight (!) courses ... starting with two appetizers to die for: Papdi Chat and Onion Bhaji. Of the remaining dishes, I especially loved the Punjabi Dhal, the Aloo Gobi and the Mushroom Pillau.I visit Singapore rather frequently -- no question but that I will head back to this new restaurant again

For a non-restaurant setting, the price is considered high. While the food is ok, I can get better quality food at this price around Singapore. Try Vash at the kallang indoor stadium, more romantic and tastier food

nice food i enjoyed very much and service was very good

Great excellent service and sincere warm boss giving worthy advise on the ordering. Great value for lunch set meal.. its a pity that they don't have dinner set meal. Cosy small corner with such pricing.. will be great if more spacious and air-con.

We 3 friends been here for quick dinner because we had reserved for movie in Shaw Balestier for an Tollywood movie "Orange". We were hungry and time was very less for movie. Staff understood us while we talking over table and offered quick service to make sure we reach Shaw Balestier soon. Food quality was good, quick service had offered and price was little high

If you like to try great Indian food you have to go to Tandoori Corner. We live in Singapore and each time we have guests we bring them there at least once during their stay. So far everybody loved the food and it¬¥s also not expensive. The service is great and everybody is nice and caring. Definitely a must

We went to this restaurant with high expectations, after reading all the positive reviews on tripadvisor. After eating at Tandoori Corner, I've now lost my trust for tripadvisor. Seriously, there is not one positive thing I can say about this restaurant. There is no indoor seating; only a few dirty chairs and tables set up outside in the corridor of Balestier Plaza. While we were eating, it started raining, and a bit of the dirty rain water landed straight into our food and our faces. The waiters were rude and aloof, and the service was horrible. They have very few dishes, so we didn't really have too many options. The food took ages to arrive, and once it finally came, it was terribly disappointing. I am from India, and I've eaten at countless Indian restaurants, and this was easily the worst. It was bland (and I told the waiter to make it extra spicy), flavorless, and not at all authentic. And the quantity was also quite small, so you're going to have to order more than you usually do. So at least the price must be decent, right? Not quite. It cost $40 for 3 people, which is not worth paying for this restaurant

My partner (a journalist and wannabee chef) and I adore Indian food and make a point of trying as many Indian restaurants as we can when travelling (including several trips to India). Being really picky, we expected to find something to criticise with regards to the food or service at the Tandoori Corner (despite the good reviews we'd read)....but we couldn't! The Mutton Kebab was juicy with a perfect balance of spices; the Murgh Vindaloo was, as promised, spicy enough to provide a very decent amount of heat and tingling numbness for those, like us, who love their curries hot...without detracting at all from the flavour; the Saag Paneer was so green, rich and creamy that we spent a long time trying to identify the combination of spices and the Mixed Vegatable Raita and Naan perfectly complimented the meal. The prices were reasonable (but not cheap for Singapore) and the service was excellent. Our only criticism is the location of the restaurant....which is a relatively decent walk from the nearest MRT...and that the all the tables are outside (no air-con). However, this won't stop us from going there again

Went there last weekend and really enjoyed the fantastic Tandoori food. The Tandoori-prawns were excellent and after a first order we had to get a second portion since it tasted very, very good! The restaurant is more "street restaurant" with no ( maybe I did not see them?) tables inside. The open kitchen and the reception are inside, the tables are outside but you can eat there also if it is rainy. We will definitely come back to have another round of Tandoori-prawns

This place is superb. We live in Singapore and eat out a lot and at many places. Our favourite food is Indian, north and south. This place is the best of the lot, good value, superb service and, most importantly, they really care about food. this is quite simply the best North Indian food I've eaten and there's a lot of love and care gone into this menu. we've had most of what's on the menu, but i have to say the mutton biriyani is a world-beater (yes, really!) and the vegetable curries (particularly the eggplant and mixed vegetable) are stunning. you'll be surprised how much better even something like a butter chicken is when it's done by someone who cares and knows what they're doing. magic! when you see chefs coming here to eat you know its gotta be good. don't miss it

Just when I almost given up on finding real good Indian cuisine in Singapore... I chanced upon Tandoori Corner and I was blown away. The food was fit for a Maharaja while the prices fit just about anyone that appreciates Indian cuisine. Believe me, I am a total critic and have very high expectations on Indian cuisine and Tandoori Corner past with flying colours. It makes one wonder if the chef was once the personal chef of some palace in India. I strongly recommend this humble food paradise to anyone that wants a piece of Northen India. I really will ONLY go back there to have my fix of Indian cuisine
