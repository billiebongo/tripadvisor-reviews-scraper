Outstanding service, excellent food. The octopus and chorizo paella was one the best I've ever had. If your looking for a nice place for tapas or Spanish this place is definitely worth a look.

Food was good. Chef Daniel came by our table and had a chat with us. Very nice and friendly. The staff are also friendly and accommodating. Overall we had a lovely experience.
5
I had their set lunch here and it was great. Tje gazpacho was top notch and the fideua had the mos beautiful flavooursome chopitos (small calamares), service was very good too professional but friendly. Definitely coming back.

Really enjoyed my meal at OLA, good food, service and atmosphere. But pricy for what you get, even if you factor in the location.

We went for Valentine's Day dinner. It was a good choice. The ambience is nice, though the space is a bit crowded. The service extremely attentive & efficient, without being intrusive. The chef came around quite a few times to check with us. Now the most important component - food. We went with the set Valentine's day menu for 2. The oysters & gazpacho was excellent. So was the bread & olive oil/balsamic dip. The prawns were a huge disappointment. They were definitely not fresh. Main reason I am not giving 5 stars to the restaurant. Next was salt baked fish with panzanella salad. While the salad was very good, the fish was totally bland and a tad undercooked. The dish was saved only because of the accompaniments. The lamb was very good. Dessert was truly delicious. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and return myself, but avoid prawns and fish, which is sad as it is a seafood speciality restaurant. The restaurant needs to seriously look into the quality of prawns & fish.

One of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore helmed by the talented Daniel Chavez. This is my third time here and apart from the pulpo which is a personal favorite, I tried 2 specials of the day: grilled pork belly and for the main - a rack of lamb. The pork belly was grilled perfectly and went very well with the calamari in the dish. The lamb rack was perfectly done with tender pink center and well seasoned. The service is friendly, sincere and attentive. And Chef comes and greets all his customers personally always, showing how he appreciates them. Will definitely not be my last time here!

Brought my Wife for her birthday dinner.Enjoyed appetisers especially. Main course for seafood is ok. Lamb rack was very fresh but not the kind of marination I would like. It's in the Business district so guests were mainly after hours people. Environment was quite noisy. Other than that. Still great food and friendly service. Pleansantly surprised by the complimentary birthday cake for wife though can do without the birthday song by friendly restaurant team.
4
Suckling pork leg confit is one of the best I have ever tasted. Crispy skin and yet tender juicy meat inside. But it takes about 40 mins wait and this is indicated on the menu. Seafood soup was Good But paellas (octopus) is small and not as good. Lamp was disappointing as it was undercook. Asparsgus with iberico ham was good. Good service and very helpful staff. Total costs about $60 per pax's.
4
A business party decided on an impromptu business lunch. They were packed to the gills but made a space for us at the bar. The three-course set - specially for those seated at the bar - was excellent value. To start, we had the cold tomato gazpacho with salad, followed by a main (choose from 4). I had the roast pork on a bed of mash and salad - it was done just right, with the pork tender and succulent, balanced by the piquant salad - both in just the right proportion.The decaf cappuccino at the end was also one of the best. You could literally peel away the layer of thick foam before reaching the coffee beneath. Just heavenly.Would recommend. They are open for lunch on weekdays and dinner on Saturday
5
We are regulars at Ola. For the second consecutive year, our family dinner on New Year's Eve was another wonderful dinner experience. Located in the business district, you can change the fireworks display after dinner too. There are a few good tapas restaurants in Singapore but what makes Ola standout in my view is the consistency of the food, friendliness of the whole crew - owner/Chef Daniel, sommelier, service staff and everyone in the kitchen. We usually order whatever they have on the specials, and a couple of our favourite tapas like the gambas and octopus. Good wine selection to accompany the meal
4
Great place to dine with your companion or business meeting. Dishes packed a punch of flavour. Pretty much every of the dishes here i enjoyed. Will be back.
4
Food is good and tasty. Portions are however very small for the price especially the paella. Service is good and staff are polite but cooking time could be faster perhaps.. Dinner costs us $450 for four persons including a bottle of wine.
5
I am for sure going back here. The food was very authentic. I would recommend the Iberian ham as an extra tapas.
5
This was my third visit to this fantastic Singapore restaurant and again I wasn't disappointed Chef Daniel turned out a fantastic lunch for our group as good as anything I've had in Spain
4
Tucked in mbfc, this very nice Spanish restaurant offers a great nite out. I'm impressed with the service, there's always someone attending to us taking care of everything. Food is great. Must try suckling pig n seafood paella n Spanish tortilla. House wine is decent too. Portions are not huge here so expect to pay moreI'll be bac
5
This place was almost empty when we came for dinner but the food is really good. Waiter was chatty and recommended exactly what we should have. Many people said the portions were small but I ate until I was very full. The best and most beautiful dish was scallops capparcio - highly recommended. Octopus paella was also very good. I didn't like the Catalan fisherman stew though
5
Food was seriously good. But the portion is a tad small for their mains, if their prices were to drop by 10% would do more justice to it. Fabulous dinner none the less. Service was great as well. Very attentive to details. Definitely the top Spanish food restaurant in Singapore for me by far. Would definitely return
3
There is nothing to complaint about the food.Every ingredient used is really tasty.Service is OK too.However, it's extremely overpriced!You can get at least the same quality of Spanish food in other places for cheaper price!$53 (included GST) for one portion of paella during lunch time is insane
5
Celebrated my fiancÃ©'s birthday at Ola Cocina Del Mar. Food, ambience and service was excellent. The Restaurant further impressed the both of us with a surprise birthday celebration where the staffs prepared a slice of cake and sang a birthday song. I did not request this from the restaurant but they went the extra mile to prepare the small and heart warming celebration. Would like to thank all the staffs for the mini surprise
5
Whilst this restaurant is in the very bland MBFC, the decor makes you feel as though you are in an old well-established local restaurant and sets the tone for a great evening.The service is excellent, and having been twice in a matter of days now I've tried enough of the dishes to say there doesn't appear to be any weak link!The Gazpacho is truly delicious and the Octopus was another stand out dish.The wine list is extensive, and I think starts from around $85.We'll definitely be going back
4
Excellent seafood stew with a South American touch! The meat skewers were certainly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside.
5
We have visited this place 3 times now and it never fail to amaze us. Everything is just perfect! The appetizers, paella, octopus (to die for), steak dessert and service are all impecable! Pictures from all three visits combined. 😊
4
I love the salmon carpaccio n the 2 paella (squid ink n octopus/chorizo were excellent)! Must try! Churros were also v good. One of the better ones I have had.
4
Daniel's creation is outstanding and his team of service staff simply dedicated! I get wowed every time I am there for lunch/ dinner/ drinks.
4
Food is great, love the bread they serve as a starter too. I can see that some of the service staff work really hard while others seem to be too relaxed--as a result need to frequently ask for water. The chef is excellent, cooks amazing food and generally will come to say hello to diners
5
I have had the pleasure to go eat at OLA a few times now and have found it to be, well Excellent. Services is great, attnetive without being intrusive, food is wonderful, refreshing, new, and well I could go on but the trick is to get over to eat there! Try the squid, its devine

OLA is a open concept kitchen restaurant serving contemporary Spanish cuisine at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3.The dishes which they serve are scrumptious and fresh.Ambience is rather modern and dark.For tapas, we tried their PULPO (grilled Spanish octopus) which was lighly seasoned just right for the seafood freshness to come through.Their CARPACCIO (marinated salmon) was a gorgeous deep pink colour which conveyed freshness.We also enjoyed their crispy baby calamari (CALAMARCITOS).For mains, our group had their roasted Welsh lamb (CORDERO ROSTIDO CON SALSA DE PEDRO XIMENIEZ) which was hearty and rich. I tried their unique and tasty noodle and fish paella (which takes 20 minutes to prepare). This was delectable with generous chunks of fresh wild New Zealand fish (FIDEUA DE SETAS CON PESCADO). Another enjoyed their popular signature "OLA" paella dish with Spanish octopus and pork sausage (PAELLA DE PULPO Y CHORIZO).For dessert, we tried their PEANUT (Dark Chocolate Cake, Concord Grape Jelly and Peanut Ice Cream). This was decadent but the portion could have been larger.We also shared their FRUTAS OLA Sautéed Bananas with Spanish Brandy, Créme Catalan Ice Cream and Oranges.Regrettably, they forgot our churros, and we had to cancel this order.Portions are just adequate.Price are not a steal though, so even lunch cost does stack up when ordering the tapas, mains and dessert accumulatively.Service is rather attentive, but would have been better appreciated if they were delivered with smiles as well.Recommended for Spanish cuisine business or 'special occasion' lunch, around this area
4
I didn't expect that at all but eventually this place was really good getting the atmosphere and kick back after long day Good songs - stuff -food - drinks basically just great place to go to Spain in singapore !!!! i suggests the sangria of course!!!!!!!
5
Reviews were good so decided to try. Even better than expected. Daniel Chavez, the owner and chef, greeted us as we were seated and came by the table again both during and after the meal. The staff was just the right amount of attentive. The best part was the food. We had seafood and pork belly tapas, and a signature dish of iberico pork which our waiter recommended. The seasoning was perfect, the ingredients fresh, the pork mouth watering. The Spanish house wine was very good. We will definitely return next time we are in Singapore. Although pricey, worth every penny.Located very close to Marina Bays Sands
5
Regular visitor to this awesome establishment. Wonderful mix of modern Spanish dishes with the chefs Peruvian/Nikkei influences coming in some dishes (amazing Ceviche's - we get everytime). Also the Paella's are a brilliant. Friendly relaxed service, amazing winelist and great vibe. One of Singapore's best unpretentious eats
5
Very warm,friendly and alert staff. Food was delicious too.ee tried the fried baby octopus, seafood tomato pasta, another beef main and Churros for dessert.
5
No pretence tapas. Really neat stuff. Worth the money. Need to try. Adil, Daniel and the team worked uber hard to make it work! Keep up the good job guys!
4
Food portion is rather small. Not mean for sharing. Overall food quality is good. Service staff are attentive. Nice embience.
4
We had the grilled Spanish octopus, SECRETO IBERICO and seafood paella and they were great. Churros came with a vanilla pastry cream, albeit a tad sweet, it was a pleasure.
4
The tiradito is a must. Ask Daniel, the Peruvian chef, to prepare for you a fish tiradito too as it is not in the menu. Other fishes are good. Daniel is very friendly!
5
We went all in for a tapas dinner. Five deliciuos with fish, calamari, and meat. Very good bread with super olive oil and balsamico. The sevice was super and we definitely will be back to try some of the paellas. Easy access from Downtown station is also a plus when all your money is gone for the bil
5
Since Catalunya Restaurant closed down, we had not found a Spanish Restaurant worth visiting regularly until Ola. Surprisingly, they have been around for 4 years helmed by Chef Daniel Chavez.Food was excellent with many novel combinations. The tapas were excellent. We had one of the specials of the day - Scotland Bamboo Clam. It was tender and truly enjoyable. We also tried their Calamaresito (Fried Baby Squid) cooked just right - crunchy yet tender meat. We also had their mushroom omelette and it was very well prepared. Omelette was ver fluffy and balanced the flavour of the mushrooms. The finale was the Baby octopus paella with pork chorizo. Excellent.Chef Daniel showed us his open kitchen explaining to us his creation. Kitchen was clean even with the ongoing cooking. We even saw his refrigerator where he stored the white wines and other condiments.Food was definitely much better than Catalunya, it would have been our Favourite had we tried the restaurant beforehand
4
Had a lovely dinner with my family. We were attended to carefully by the waiting staff, and the head chef, Daniel, personally came to our table, to speak with us about the food.Dishes were prepared and served with a unique mix of finesse and homeliness.Finally, I received a whatsapp message from Chef Daniel thanking us for patronising the restaurant and hopes to see us again.Highly recommended for great food and extremely warm service
3
First of all it is not a Spanish restaurant, as the waiter said. It is more like Peruvian.Servings are really small and the prices are very expensive. I don't care so much about the fancy presentation as to the taste and the servings. 42 sgd for a dessert place if paella is a joke.The Buey steak was not Buey. It was lukewarm and it was just an average cut. Not acceptable.Service was poor. We were given the typical olive oils d balsamic vinegar served in Italian restaurants (not in Spanish ones) but no bread to dip it in.In my opinion, don't waste your money her
5
The raw material and ingredients are of impeccable quality. (In an environment dominated by farmed fish and industrial chicken, their meat and fish are pure and flavorful.) The recipes combine tradition and creativity, with always an emphasis on flavor. The execution is almost always flawless. The open kitchen is irreproachably organized and clean. The service is attentive and friendly, a rare luxury here. The wine list is varied and reasonably priced. Even the desserts are worth the visit (try the churros)
3
Had wine and tapas during happy hour while waiting for friends to knock off from MBFC area. Food is average considering the price tag, but service standard needs improvement as orders are either missed out or served wrongly at times.
5
An outstanding Spanish restaurant. The paella is bursting with flavour, and the suckling pig is a work of wonder - tender, juicy flesh with crackling skin and beautifully rendered fat.
Don't let the financial centre location put you off. You must try this restaurant!
5
Tapas are excellent, made with high quality ingredients . Service is also very good . Extensive Wine list.
Went there quite a few times , regular and always delicious .
4
Chef Daniel formerly from Santi, he is really talented. I am Regular customer of Ola because he maintains the food quality without fail all these years!
3
Came here for business lunch with high expectation but was quite disappointed. Everything is average. I think the chef held too many wine dinner events (always received email blasts from Ola about one of their too many events) rather than focusing on being the best Spanish restaurants possible in Singapore
5
A ttended a friend's birthday dinner at Ola & it was an amazing feast of Spanish & Peruvian dishes by Chef Daniel Cahvez. Delicate seafood as well as wagyu ribeye complimented by Spanish dessert Churros on 6 course special menu. Food was excellent & top Spanish wines make a sensational evening !! Looking forward to try a few more dishes next time !!
3
I went there with a friend and we chose seats at the counter. We were 2 people and ordered tapas (in total 6, although 5 would have been sufficient for 2 pp), however the space around there is not big enough to actually present the food. We had to shuffle around plates the entire evening in order to get the dishes we ordered. The food was decent, nothing extraordinary and for sure not worth the premium prices. The wine list is bigger when you go for a bottle, for open wines there were only 3 reds (and I believe 3 whites as well which we did not try). The reds were good, however the amounts poured per glas seem to depend on the waiter. As so often in malls, the restaurant has no own bathroom. Disturbing: Sitting at the counter we could watch the guy cutting ham and cheese with a machine. As he did not use the protection panel to push the ham/ cheese against the rotating blade, I was getting a bit tense and afraid of his fingers
5
First time to this restaurant. Not disappointed. Delicious selection of tapas and main courses to choose from, not too big. Dessert was also very good. Staff very helpful, they were excellent, great service. A very good wine list. I liked that the chef said hello, a nice touch. Would definitely like to go back.
3
I had the lunch set with my colleague last month. The best thing about this restaurant is that you can catch up over an unhurried lunch in the center of town and emerge in a relaxed mood - you don't feel pressured to finish or give up your table.$28 for a starter, cold soup and a main - good value for a quiet lunch in Marina Bay Financial Centre. The food was average and I wouldn't dine here for dinner or order the a la carte without the Amex platinum offer.
3
Not the best I had so far. Average food and service.The environment was cosy.We ordered fried baby calamari, crispy pork, octopus and pork sausage paella and roasted suckling pig.Maybe it'll be more worth with the palate promo but take note paella is not considered a main course to qualify for the discount
4
Had the counter seat set lunch and it was really afforable. Paellae was well executed and the salad was quite decent. 2 Appetiters, one main for $28++. Overall super value for the price and quality. Would love to try the ala carte paella soon.
5
My hubby suggested that we try this place which was located at the MBS financial centre. I wasn't too excited of the location but since the reviews were all rather good, I thought why not?Upon our arrival, we were ushered to a table not too far away from the entrance. We were seated next to a table of 3 and I would have to say the tables were too close resulting in my hubby and I having no choice but to eavesdrop of the conversation going next door!Service started off great - we were given the drinks menu and then the food menu as well as the list of specials. Everything looked good and upon their advice we opted the tiradito, gan as, gazpacho, pulpo or octopus, Ramona (toasted bread with anchovies) and crab salad. The tiradito was one of their specials and it was actually raw scallop. It was my hubby's favourite as it was unique, tastes super fresh and very appetizing indeed.My favourite of the night had to be the gazpacho (cold tomato soup) and the crab salad which was crab meat with green apple. Both were perfection in my opinion as I love dishes which are a little on the sourish sweet side. The octopus was very well soft and it had to be the best I have tasted in a long time. Chef Daniel Chavez, came to speak to us towards the end of our dinner and he was really friendly. We learnt that he was previously from Santi at MBS and he is a Peruvian who left Peru for Spain at 18 years old. He is all about getting everyone to enjoy his food and his cooking/food will speak for itself. True to form, his food spoke volumes to us and we are pretty much became fans instantaneously :-)There are a number of events taking place in the weeks to come as Ola apparently invites a number of top chefs over as a culinary offering to its patrons. We checked out the menu on offer for the events coming up and they look like a feast for all who love good old Spanish cuisine. So far, our first visit to Ola has certainly piqued our interest to check out more of Chef Daniel's menu options and we cannot wait for the next visit. If you have never been there, you ought to as it is one of the best Spanish places out there.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, I realized they were having Peruvian week!!! I was ecstatic. It was a pleasant surprise. We ordered starters from the Peruvian dishes and two paellas/fideos for main course. For the Peruvian starters we ordered the octopus with capers (not bad but not outstanding) and scallops tiraditos (thinly sliced scallops like carpaccio)(delicious and quite interesting especially with the shoyu-based sauce. The coup-d'Ã©tat was the chicken anticuchos (grilled chicken on skewer). The salsa was to die for!! It was addictive!! There was hint of Mexican chili sauce similar to Salsa Valentina. The two paellas were good, but not oustanding. There was not enough cracked rice on the bottom. The portions were small. Tres leches cake and arroz con leche were well executed and not too sweet. Overall, it was a lovely lunch. I would go to Ola more often, if not for the price.
5
This hidden gem is tucked into the tower 3 lobby of MBFC, and if you weren't looking for it you might walk right past it. But once you've crossed the threshold you are welcomed like family, with the warm staff, the open kitchen and great collection of photography hung on the walls. The chef is extremely friendly and does not hesitate to visit with his guests. Though I was there for a quick meeting; the ceviche and chicharron was excellent. The wine recommended by the manager paired well with my meal. OLA makes it very easy to come again and recommend to my friends
5
It is always a treat to go to Ola. We try and go there at least twice a month, and attend most of their special dinners. Usually, as it is just two of us, we sit at the bar; this time however, we were in a table with friends. Service amazing (something of a rarity in a lot of places in Singapore), quality of food excellent (have never been disappointed), choice was great. We had a blast and enjoyed every minute of it. For those who complain about the price, this is Singapore and you have to pay for quality; having said that, this is not a restaurant which prices are not according to what you get. Brilliant place and it is definitely a restaurant you cannot miss. Well done
3
Marked improvement over time, Still, if I want a memorable Spanish meal, I wouldn't cross town to dine at Ola, but for people in the CBD, it's not a bad place. The dishes are not as creative as at the best Spanish restaurants (and the paellas are way too dry), and the atmosphere not the most lively, but you can still have a satisfying experience here. Good wine list. Pricey for the quality
2
Went for lunch with my wife and sat at a table. The food was just average, but the prices were unreasonably expensive for what was served. At $28 for the chorizo, very fatty and not crispy, we received four tiny pieces. We had 4 tapas, a glass of cava each, paid $140 and left hungry
4
Went for dinner on a Saturday. Sat at the counter to watch the open-concept kitchen in action (and also because the table offered was just inches away from another).Service was quite lovely and attentive. For tapas, we had the calamari (one of the best I've had in a while), chicharron (crispy pork belly; very nice too), & huevo frito (yummy yummy). For main course, we shared the squid ink noodle paella, where the noodle was kinda crispy, but nevertheless delicious too. Unfortunately, we were too full to try desserts. But do try the Pisco Sour cocktail; it's refreshing & satisfying. Can't fault the food or service
5
Book in advance, because the restaurant gets busy especially on the weekend. Two of us ordered three tapas dishes and a paella to share - this was plenty. The food was amazing, specifically the Pulpos (octopus), was the best octopus I have ever had, and that includes octopus I've eaten in Spain. Large pieces of juicy octopus, perfectly cooked and not remotely chewy! The Paella was delicious, very traditional, cooked in it's own Paella pan with a generous portion of prawns on top and a half lobster which was cooked to perfection! Great wine selection, sangria, desserts etc. The service is fantastic!! Staff are very familiar with the menu and are able to make recommendations on dishes and portions etc. Will definitely return soon
4
Restaurant was surprisingly busy on a Sat night given the location. Reason was clear - great food and good Restaurant was busier than expected given CBD location on a Sat night. Tapas are of the variety favoured by SG restaurants / aka heavier than what u get at a Spanish tapas bar - but were good plates of fresh food nonetheless. We will be back 
4
The food is always nice. So is the service. But the price is pretty expensive relative to other peers. I guess that's the price to pay as there are not so many similar restaurant around the area...
5
Well, when you introduce a Peruvian in your cuisine, the food improves 100 percent. Chef Daniel has done a great job! The drinks and food is amazing. A little pricey but well worth it, for either business, friends, and special occasions!!
5
Had the gambas, causa, huevo frito and calamarcitos. As the first 3 items were so excellent, the calamarcitos paled in comparison.The lobster paella was so delectable we ordered another portion again! For dessert we had the churros, tres leeches and peras. All were very good as its not too sweet and refreshing.Will be back to Ola very soon :)
4
Reserve in good time to get a table!Service: very friendly and professional service.Food: nice presentation, very tasty and freshDrinks: good choice of beer and winesSitting at the bar you may watch the activity of the kitchen just in front of you. I admire the organisation of Daniel Chavez the Owner and Chef of the bar - he directs the kitchen and service staff very efficiently.This is a recommendable tapas bar although it isn´t exactly cheap, but you get good service and food for the money.We´ll surely be bac
5
A perfect place to have an easy dinner, created by a fine cuisine chef ! The mix Peru and Spain, with Asian accent is fabulous. Chef will spare time with customers , but his vigilant eye always on top on the kitchen staff. Extensive wine list mainly from Spain; but ask sommelier for some out of the list bottles which he always has available.
5
Highly recommended, I've eaten here on many different occasions, from a romantic evening dinner on Valentines, to a business lunch and it's consistently excellent. And it's better than most decent restaurants in Spain!The service is attentive and friendly without being distracting and you're greeted like an old friend. The wine list is great and predominantly Spanish of course although try the Quinta from Portugal.And then there's the food. The Cerviche is wonderful, as is the Pulpo (octopus) and Burratta salad for tapas or entre. I recommend the fish of the day, paella or rib eye for main. Although i don't think you can go wrong on Chef Daniel menu, who is on hand to give advice and feedback and i'm sure it'll be positive.Easy parking is available under Tower 3 and don't be put off by the location in MBFC, once inside the restaurant, you could be in Spain

We decided to try Ola of which we had heard great reviews. First we couldn't find it as it is very well hidden inside one of the Marina Bay Financial Towers. So we called them and they showed us the way. Staff is highly educated and very friendly. The foods was nicely presented and that was about the best of it. The texture and taste was not so good, well, it was not really bad, but definitely below the quality of some other tapas bars we have frequented in Singapore. The paella was probably the best we tried (in all, we had 7 different dishes of which we only really loved 2). The cava is very cheap though at SG$13++ where you could pay a lot more in other places. But still this cannot offset the food which was more or less a disappointment. The chef seems to spend more time outside than inside the kitchen as he walks around the tables and talks to people, including waving them out as you leave and sending a text message to thank you two days later. A bit over the top if you ask me. Will not go there again.
4
It's always worrying to go to a restaurant for the first time and not know if its gonna be good. Especially in Singapore where a night out for fancy meal is always expensive..But we sincerely thought the food is great!!!!! Portions are not massive but everything was excecuted really well! Quality ingredients! And you can tell well handled!! Coupled with the fact that Chef Daniel Chavez was there to chat with us at least 3-4 times.Daniel wasn't at the cooking station as it wasn't a busy night, even then the food was great, and that tells you they have a great team too!! Good job guys.The whole experience a lovely one! WE WILL BE BACK! See you again guys!! And thanks for my wife's little birthday surprise!We had :-octopus>>> lovely! a lot of work and time goes into this seemingly simple dish!-Ceviche >>> refreshing, spicy, tangy.great balance. loved it. ordered an extra spanish tomato on bread to soak up the sauce!!-seafood Paella>>>lobster was sold out! but still was great! good balance of burnt rice at the edge, perfectly cooked seafood. very nice balance!- Churros- went awesome well with the birthday ice cream surprise! could be a little less firm more delicate, maybe a little too hardT, but it tasted good!
4
A rare gem in the financial district helmed by an affable chef with an unassuming attitude that permeates down to all his staff. It feels like eating at home but with the choice of great tapas and a range of fine wines to go with it. Yet to find another place serving Spanish tapas with a Peruvian touch and flavours in Singapore.Chef Daniel is as careful with what he serves on his menu as with the prices. He believes in sustainability of food source at sustainable prices for all his customers
5
The great staff and Chef Chavez make our Anniversary dinner very special. The flavours combination of the South American and Spanish together are the Best!.Together with such a lovely and friendly staff. We can't wait to go back.Muchísimas gracias al excelente cocinero Sr.Chavez por deleitarnos con una cena tan estupenda, nos encanto todo, el ceviche tan estupendo, la Paella, y el personal tan encantador que en todo momento estuvieron pendientes de nosotros.Merci Beaucoup Chef Chavez Magnifique délicieux diner
5
It says enough that during dessert we were already making plans for our next return visit and what to try then.
See you again soon chef!
5
Absolute stunning & authentic Spanish / Peruvian cuisine. Chef Daniel Chavez cooks with his heart, you can taste in every single dish.
Great service, authentic interior and a all time great place to have lunch or dinner.
5
Excellent food, quality service, warm experience. And the Executive chef Daniel always a good host..
5
I had an amazing lunch here, it was absolutely divine. We had a seafood salad which was the special of the day and once of the best appetisers I've had in a long time, the crispy squid starter, and squid ink paella down to the desserts, churros and an amazing cheese platter, were stunning in their flavours. I highly recommend this spot and will definitely go back!
5
Was there for dinner and was delighted with the wonderful food and service. Wife said she had the best balsamic vinegar ever. Was informed that they imported from Modena.. Almost bought a bottle home. But the main star of our meal was the Paella. We ordered a single serving of PAELLA “MAR Y MUNTANYA” with lobster and prawns and felt that we should have ordered another one immediately. But as we've also ordered other excellent tapas like the fried calamari and foie gras.. we had to settle for separate paella orders next time. And yes, there will be a next time
5
Came here for lunch and did not regret it a single bit of my time. Food, from tapas to mains to dessert.. You've got to try this restaurant. Chef, sommelier and the guy that served us for very friendly. I recommend Ceviche, baby squid and the Congrejo. These are under tapas and you can share. Portion size was good for 2 person to share. We share the steak, it was delicious and very tasty. Lastly, please don't leave the restaurant until you tried the Churros. One of the best Spanish Restaurant I've tried. It's definitely worth the trip to MBFC.
5
Looked at the review of this place and decided to have dinner here after watching a show at Marina Bay. First of, we tried the menu of the day, Mushroom Salad, and OMG we were blown away! It was simple and it was very delicious!, then we ordered the squid which was good, the Australian langoustine (very fresh, very delicious) and of course sea food paella - which made the whole night a perfection!Overall, we had such an amazing experience, and definitely will try to come back anytime soon :
5
This restaurant is a little gem, a great menu, great staff it was an absolutely great lunch. The menu has a little bit of everything but my Paella was exceptional. Really a must, great friendly service and nothing is too much, a short visit from the head chef just for a hello. Give this one a try do not miss out. Enjoy
5
I went there yesterday with my daughter and husband to celebrate his birthday. I didn't really know what yo expect. My daughter is a bit picky and not very adventurous... The menu was interesting.. So we just tried a few dishes. Nothing, nothing was wrong! Even the bread and the oil were delicious. I saw my daughter so interested in trying all the dishes on the table.The service is also excellent. The executive chef is adorable and all the staff is moving gently but efficiently around the tables, providing the perfect balance of privacy and attention. Everybody was super nice also to our daughter and promptly attended to her demands. They even sang a happy birthday song in Spanish for my husband, with a free dessert and a candle.a nice surprise indeed!

Visited here recently to meet a friend for weekday lunch. What a great surprise... I have seen Ola but never been before although it's close to my office.We sat at the bar which has a view of all the chef action. Food was very tasty - I will definitely go back..
4
This is a friend's normal spot so the restaurant was very familiar with the whole group. Excellent food and great chefs picks. The head chef came and spoke with us for a few minutes and was very warming. We would definitely come again.
2
quality of the food aside (and it was just ok, nothing amazing)... how can anyone justify to charge SGD 170 for 4 tapas and a bottle of water? i seriously have no words...

Best peruvian food in town with fresh ingredient and top notch service. Highly recommended. Must try fish cerviche

Our Company decided on giving OLA a try for a function coinciding with visits from colleagues and customers from Switzerland, and Germany. As we all love good Seafood we heard that OLA served good food in the CBD.We were greeted by Chef Daniel who became our host and even sat down and had drinks with us during the course of the evening!I have had South American foods before, but they were mostly Red Meated theme restaurants, and standard fare.This was completely different!We started with an assortment of Tapas, Prawns, Calamari, Octopus, Gurnard Carpaccio, Scallops all done in different tastes, and styles, all went down well with Italian Beers and Spanish Red and White wines.On to main courses of Ribeye Grilled Steaks, Pork Cheek, and Langostines in Pasta, it just was wonderful!Was so busy having a good time i forgot to take a lot of pictures! Cheeses, and Chourros for Dessert covered in chocolate!The staff was very good as small plates moved fast as this makes the food enjoyable, not waiting long for next course to come.Definitely will go back again! Prices a bit upscale but the tastes make it worthwhile, especially if you like fresh Seafood dishes!

Really good find in an inauspicious business-focused location. A good choice of interesting tapas and main dishes, especially good if you want a change from Asian / Fusion food.Can recommend the sirloin steak, and my co-diners agreed. Not cheap, and aimed at those on a business budget as opposed to tourist

This is only the second time i'm trying Spanish food here in Singapore. My first experience was poor and very expensive leading me to shun Spanish food here. This restaurant changed my opinion. Wife brought me here to celebrate my birthday and I had a joyous occasion. The food was good and the service excellent. I even got a birthday song sang to me by the crew in Spanish. It's conveniently located at Marina Bay Financial Tower 3. The tapas and paellas were very good. The roasted pork was ok only because IMHO it's very hard to beat the best "Chinese Roasted Pok". Desert was the icing on the cake. Love the whole experience and will come back again

I was so dissapointed for the food. In my birthday I wanted to have a delicious fresh ceviche and Lomo saltado like Those are make in Peru but not. The famous peruvian chef was not there. And I got a very small " ceviche" made with a kind of orange sauce that I really didn't like it and my Lomo saltado was a big portion of beef the tasted not like the original and not fried potatoes instead potatoes chip Lol. What a pity to spend a special celebration where offer to the public original peruvian food and portion and flavour are not even close.
4
The food is very good. The roast pig is good !The service is good.They recommended us a Spanish wine and was good too.Overall experience is very good. Except for the lunch for 2, we spend close to SGD 450.Worth it, but should not be a regular affair

Am currently on a wk long attachment at Marina Bay Financial Centre. My colleagues literally dragged me for Spanish food lunch..... Friends who know me knows that I have never been a fan of Spanish food (fm previous experiences) .... But well... Am glad that they dragged me here....Was greeted with such a lovely smile fm the lady at the entrance and led into the cosy place and seated at the table with comfy leather chairs.I looked around me... Was surprised to see that the place was quite packed for a high end lunch crowd .... ( but I found the answer by the end of my meal)Food:I had a squid ink noodle paella as recommended by my friends they had a Rib eye steak and a homemade pasta with tomato chorizo sauce ... My noodle was so yummy that I couldn't get enough of it, cleaned out to the last bit and stole a bite fm my friend's pasta, and steak...... can't wait for my next time here to try other stuff.We had a sharing of Churros and me (the troublesome one again ) had requested the chocolate n vanilla cream to be separated. Not a fan of sweet stuff .... I said I was only going to take just one but I ended up taking three...Service: The staff were very professional but not cold, they carry with them the feel of warmth n sincerity. The chef came and greeted us, checking on the food and chatted a bit. Staff wasn't pushy and they're so efficient that I joked with my friends that they must have know magic. I don't even feel them around but they'll just pop up at the moment that we need them. Overall :Lunch well spent! I can't wait to be back. The price is reasonable, what you would expect to pay for a high end restaurant in a CBD area. In fact, I hv paid higher prices in the super famous restaurants which may not have better food or even service but just better views. Ola may not have the most amazing aerial view but the interesting deco is not going to disappoint and it has amazing food and people, which is totally worth it.

I love Spanish and was delighted to learn about this new highly rated Peruvian influenced Spanish restaurant. The food was good and interesting. Service was prompt and attentive. Chef Daniel visited our table for a friendly chat and pictures. Ambient was nice and comfortable. Overall it was a very enjoyable evening. We did not over order but it was a surprised that the bill came up to S$950 for 6 persons with 1 bottle of wine (S$100). In comparison to some of the other very good Spanish restaurants in Singapore that I frequent, it was over priced
5
food quality is exquisite. Service impeccable.
had a pleasure to meet the owner very humble and welcoming
it is of course not cheap but definitely worth it

Went to OLA by chance for business lunch having been requested to find a place at the MBFC for an afternoon meeting convenient location. Made a booking online in the morning of the day of the lunch and got an affirmative reply very quickly - not like many other Singaporean restaurant requiring you to make online bookings 3 days in advance - as if a dove would deliver the message. Having lived in 11 different countries and dined at many exclusive restaurants around the world - the ambiance I felt walking into this outlet - I felt at home. Met at the door by a superbly well dressed and groomed attendant and guided to my table where my business associate was already seated. Since we took a while to get our small talk finished - we were at no time pressured or pushed to order - we felt being the focus - not the restaurant - like most so called fine dining outlets in Singapore which truly has no clue as to how they treat diners but making sure they push you out the door as soon as possible to turn your table. The food was exquisite - we ordered a couple of shared tapas - then fish for the man course - then finished off with a cheese board consisting of 4 different types of cheeses - accompanied with a superb Riesling suggested by the sommelier. The waiting staff buzzed around our table in an "unassuming" professional manner only seen on rare occasion tending to our needs in an uninterrupted manner leaving our conversation private. Chef and owner Daniel came to greet our table upon leaving in a subtle confident manner reassuring himself that our meal experience was up to our expectations - and yes Daniel - truly an amazing place you and your team have created at OLA - cannot wait to come back to try the many other Spanish inspired dishes! Sublime experience all around - well done
5
If you like Spanish, go visit Ola @MBFC.Chef Daniel is a dear. He comes over and talks to the patrons. If you have a special diet, ask him and he will be happy to oblige. Food quality - great! Service - very good.I have a few favorites to share with you:GAZPACHO, CALAMARCITOS, CEVICHE, PULPO to name a few. Can't go wrong here! Enjoy.
5
We visited this restaurant after 'discovering' it in a local TV show featuring Chef Daniel from Peru. It was amazing! Great ambience, excellent service staff (chef Daneil came out to chat with guests despite being busy) & the Peruvian dishes were close to the ones I had in Lima! We had ceviche which is in the menu as well as the tiradito which was one of the specials for the day..... I was so thrilled because I never dreamt of finding this dish in Singapore! The ribeye cooked Perivian style was yummy! Of course I had the Pisco Sour! And Chef Daniel gave us a shot of the Tiger's Milk too! We are definitely going back to try the other dishes
5
Staff and service - warm, professional and friendly Wine selection - goodGin - not your average 4 found everywhere else. Good selectionFood - tapas was good sizes. Mains good portions. Simple food, presentation. But all kinds of flavors do gymnastics in the mouth. Price - isn't cheap. But not expensive. Visit again ? YES!!! We had an amazing night. Thanks to good food and wonderfully warm staf
5
Wow what a find! Food and service is of incredible high standard but the ambience stays humble and cosy. You won't regret bringing your date here, your colleagues or just go by yourself and witness the chef prepare the freshest food for you while sitting at the bar counter.

Ola Cocina had several Peruvian guest chefs in town and they held an event to commemorate the collaboration. For food, there were several types of cerviche served. I managed to get my hands on the following:- Seafood Cerviche: This cerviche had cut squid, fish in a mildly spicy base and topped with a piece of sea urchin. I liked the spiciness level, not overly hot and the sea urchin was decadent. Good!- Tuna Cerviche: Fresh Tuna with a citrusy sauce made with Peruvian lemons and peppers. Its refreshing!For the event, they also partnered Proof & Company, whose specialities is in cocktails. 3 cocktails were specially concocted for the event, Campo De Encanto Pisco, Pisco Sour and Chilcano. The base ingredient is Pisco, which is a clear alcohol with an alcohol content of 40.8%. It reminds me of vodka, potent! In particular, I like Pisco Sour and Chilcano. Pisco Sour is an icon of Peru and has an interesting taste, due to the fresh lime, egg white and Amargo Chuncho Bitters. Its refreshing and nice. Pisco sour which reminds me of Whisky Sour. Its good.The Chicano is the national drink of Peru and comprise of Pisco, fresh lime and Ginger Ale. It’s potent, but nice.In addition to the cocktails, I also had Tattinger Champagne and Torres Red Wine – Mas La Plana Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, which was excellent! I look forward to coming here to try their ala carte menu soon. Try it

We opted for lunch at the counter. The gazpacho was served in a shot glass. The quinoa could had been served on a desert spoon. My pasta (main) was good but it was the size of a starter. For S$28, it was well over priced. I commented to the owner that the portions were small. He said he will give me double portions the next time. Unfortunately, there will not be a next time
5
The food was great! Good quality of ingredients and they balanced each taste very well. The wine was fantastic a very unique selection of Spanish wines and great recommendation by the manager Juan and very reasonable pricelist.The restaurant was fully booked that night but the staff seat us in the counter and offer us a glass of wine on house and the lady said once the table were available, she will move up which she did! Sitting at the counter is much nicer over looking at kitchen action and the chair was more comfortable.The staff were helpful and friendly. Chef Daniel was extremely friendly and offering all the customers a great hospitality together with the team.All in all, we like this place and we had wonderful night at Ola!! we highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back
4
Had a counter seat, so got to see the kitchen in action. Nice to see the food being prepared in front of you, however less nice to see dirty plates and cutlery being put down beside where food is being prepared. Perhaps some minor reorganisation needed here. Food was tasty and Sangria was very good. Price wise a little on the high side. However food was good and plentiful and the service was excellent and very attentive. A little more rice and less ingredients in the Paella, and making it slightly more moist would be good, however all in all was a nice experience
5
My wife and I just keep coming back. The food is excellent, the atmosphere cosy and the service impeccable. Sit at the counter and enjoy a chat with Chef Daniel while your dishes are being prepared. Highly recommended.
4
Went there with my boyfriend to celebrate hid Birthday. Good food with attentive service. They went extra mile to prepare a candle on his dessert. That was very sweet.
2
We went on Friday evening for an early dinner around 6pm. The service and offering was good. Yes indeed it was a tapas place so I can imagine the portion size but the price didn't make sense. 3 of us with a bottle of Cava($100) was 380. Hard to believe. Will I go back again? Probably not. There are other places with same quality with better price range.
4
Chef Daniel Chavez and his team are doing great work here - considering limitations in getting ingredients, very good effort in producing tasty and well prepared dishes with more than a hint of Peruvian influence. Terrific maître d' / sommelier, good wine list and a well designed if simple menu, which in itself is a typical hallmark of restaurants paying more attention to ingredients than show. Very good overall
5
First time in MBFC -but found the restaurant in Tower 3 street level easily. Got seated at the open kitchen bar counter for happy hour and watched all the action within. Whilst we waited for our dining companions (who were quite late) - we drifted through our bottle of rose punctuated with lovely little bite-size complimentary tapas plus a quick tour of the open kitchen with Chef Daniel! Everything had its place and storage was limited but the 10 plus kitchen staff worked together quite seamlessly. We particularly admired his charcoal grill oven with glowing charcoals within.We admired the TLC exuded by the hardworking dedicated pasta maker in his corner and we had to order at least one pasta dish to taste the TLC and it was very rewarding - no more lobster but they offered a crabmeat with scallop version which was delicious!We tried the daily special - the uni appetizer which was delicately delicious. The ceviche in the spicy lime & chilli dressing was appetising and the gazpacho was delightfully light and cooling.The daily special of kurobuta pork melted in your mouth and was topped with some fried calamari - lightly crispy. Our paleo-man ordered the charcoal grilled rib-eye which he polished off with gusto.My fishermans' soup reminded me of the Spanish catalan stew & was filled with clams, prawns, fish, calamari, crab stewed to perfection - nothing overcooked and nothing undercooked - in a rich gravy - mopped up by the crusty brown breadWe had high hopes for the churros which was good but could not top the ones we have had in Reno or Barcelona - the chocolate sauce served in a little container for deep dipping felt more indulgent than having the chocolate sauce served on a plate under the lattice pile of churros!Surprisingly we enjoyed the delicately flavoured vanilla rice pudding & the orange dessert.The sommeliers were most helpful with their suggestions - we started with a bottle of Gramona Rose followed by a Spanish Milmanda chardonnay & ended with a much appreciated orujo.A lovely evening out from 5:30pm till closing.......we'll be back - to try the rest of the menu

Spanish cuisine is one of the most artistic and favorable and Spanish tapas perhaps some the most enticing appetizers in the world.I unexpectedly discovered an oasis of Spanish cuisine and tapas at the Singapore Marina Bay Financial Center-Tower 3, although this is not an area recognized for unique cuisine.Allow yourself to be enticed during Happy Hour by sitting at the delightful bar, enjoying a cocktail or Spanish wine of your choice, served with complimentary and delectable Spanish tapas, which are small potions of items found on the dinner menu.One of the finest cocktails of South America is proudly served at Ola Cocina Del Mar, Pisco Sour, which is made from a liquor originating only in South America. Pisco Sour is definitely a cocktail extraordinaire, and the recipe is from Chef/Owner Daniel Chavez.The sous chefs are proud of their artistry of tapas and delight in explaining the unique combination of ingredients in every tapas created before you at the bar. You will not want to leave the Happy Hour experience at the bar with your Pisco Sour and exceptionally delicious, tapas, but, a unique menu of Spanish and Peruvian food awaits you at your dinner table.I have visited and enjoyed the cuisine in Spain and Peru and thoroughly appreciated the memories of Spain and Peru which are awaiting you at Ola Cocina Del Mar. Surprise a partner, friend, colleague or customer with a unexpected visit to Ola Cocina Del Mar when you desire a memorable experience.Leave your automobile at home, alight at Marina Bay MRT and enjoy the short 10 minute stroll to Singapore Marina Bay Financial Centre-Tower 3.Buen Provecho

Came here twice. Nothing too impressive. Ambience and service was OK. Ordered the special of the day. (Mind you: special of the day normally are double the price of normal menu, which the waiter will not inform you if you don't ask).Food - very average. Quite disappointed from what we were expecting. After all, There re many better restaurants out there.
5
We've been to Ola many times before however the dinner we received tonight was fantastic. I'd suggest sticking with the seafood and you won't be disappointed. The specials are worth hearing as they're usually v tasty. Wines are reasonably priced and the sommelier knowledgeable. Service is v personable and Head Chef Daniel is the star of the show! We won't leave it as long before returning. Can't recommend this place enough (oh, and sit at the counter as it's great to watch the chefs at work)
5
Great food good wine and even better service. We had several tapas rather than a meal each and shared them. The ham was just awesome. and the ceviche was very good. We had a spanish wine which for a change did not disappoint. Overall great afternoon.
5
My fiancé and I visited Ola Cocina Del Mar a couple of days ago for a birthday meal. The service was excellent from the moment we entered the restaurant. We had a bottle of their 2012 Basa Sauvignon Blanc- the wine was fantastic and so flavorful. For tapas we had the fish ceviche, cold tomato soup, sautéed beef,paprika grilled octopus and prawns in garlic and dried chilli oil. Every dish we had was like an explosion of flavours in our mouths. Fresh, tasty and so well combined-I would highly recommend this place to anyone craving authentic flavourful tapas. The most standout dish was the sautéed beef- it had a strong and delicious Peruvian influence thanks to the genius hands of Chef Daniel. An amazing birthday meal and experience- will return for more!
5
We had lunch & the set lunch was excellent. The chef came to our table & we had a great meal!
Definitely a must... Accessible by MRT

Daniel Chavez is an excellent chef and deserves the success of his fantastic restaurant.We started by Bouchot French Mussels, just like we were in France west coast, perfectly cook. Then we had the Angus prime rib beef, “Un Delice” served with roasted potatoes and green asparagus. All products are top quality and perfectly cooked.Well done Daniel
5
We were greeted warm welcome by the reception lady. I had a delectable dinner with my friends.Chef Daniel arrange some surprise menu for us. the starter will be Spanish iberico ham .grilled octopus .garlic oil prawns was delicious and we had the signature pallea and red prawns with saffron rice wow really well presented and yes of course the combination of great selection wine by the manager. the best dinner we had in Singapore last but not list we will be back again for another memorable experience again to OLA
5
I met my lovely wife for a drink after work here tonight. I realised that I have done a review of a place I love. So here goes.Daniel is an outstanding chef running a great kitchen team thus the food is superb. It is really that simple. Backing him up a front of house team who are the best in Singapore from my experience.Juan has never failed to find a wine which goes with the superb food. And he always makes you feel at home.I really enjoy coming in the door, sitting down to the food and wines, the feeling of comfort and real welcome. I am completely biased about this restaurant for good reason. Make sure you call to book and I hope you have as good a time as My wife and I do!!
5
I visited Ola Cocina Del Mar recently and it was exactly as I expected - beautifully balanced food. I had previously been delighted by Chef Daniel Chavez's talents at the Michelin starred Santi and I knew he would bring his unique sensibilities to Ola. Chef Daniel works with top ingredients only and his understanding of the flavor and texture profiles of seafood, and how to work with them rather than drown them out, is second to none. The other balance he brings is value for money. I am sure he is running a fine line with food costs and it is something I hope guests appreciate at the register - indeed I would challenge anyone to find a better quality-price balance in Singapore. My favorites were the octopus, which highlights Chef Daniel Peruvian cultural influence. The paella was superb - light and fresh leaving you satiated but not with the heavy feeling in the stomach the way a cheap paella can. I know saying that something as simple as the Bruschetta is superb may seem odd but it is seriously the best version I have had - I was told it was also a personal favorite of Santi Santamaria. This says something about the food at Ola - it is simple but it is superb. The best people always make things looks simple
5
It was a real pleasure to enjoy dinner at Ola. This is a Spanish restarant with a tasty paella, olive octopus and ink squid pasta. As a Peruvian citizen living in Singapore, I was surprised to find well-presented and delicious Peruvian dishes such as cebiche (raw fish with lime juice), chicharron (deep fried pork) and causa (a sort of potato pie with stuffing).The Top Chef, Daniel, he is a true gentleman, very nice and charming with all customers and with great hands to prepare the food. The restaurant staff provided good recommendations to us in terms of the main courses, wines and desserts. The restaurant has a good wine selection too. For dessert, my friends and I got arroz con leche (rice pudding) and churros. They were fantastic, To summarize, I think I will become a frequent customer of Ola
5
Having dined at Ola several times both for lunch and dinner, I must say the food and service is consistently EXCELLENT! . Tonight was a special wine tasting menu and it was FANTASTIC. The service is always attentive without being intrusive. Ola is also one of the very few restaurants in Singapore where you can dine alone and yet always made to feel welcomed and at home.Thank you Daniel and Juan for yet another fantastic evening
5
It was our anniversary and my husband decided we wanted a special evening at a restaurant we've heard friends highly recommended us, for the quality of food there. We were not at all dissapointed when we visited ola. We were exceptionally impressed by the way we were attended to and even Chef Daniel,who was formally from Santi -celebrity chef restaurant at the mbs came by to our table and took the time to prepare a specially created meal to make our dining experience such a day to remember.We will surely revisit and recommend the restaurant for the quality of service, exceptional food and wine. A well rounded, enjoyable evening spent there
5
This is in our top 5 Singapore restaurants and we visit at least one a month. Really creative Spanish cooking with a cool Peruvian slant to some of the dishes. Owner/Head Chef Daniel leads a great and enthusiastic team who are always pushing your boundaries to try something new. A "must go" restaurant
5
I have been to Ola a few times now including my last birthday where we sat and got fed all night with great wines to go with everything. We have been alone, with business and with family and every time we are treated to great food, service and wines. You can come here for a casual meal and wine to relax or a full blown dining experience, nothing is hidden as you can watch everything that goes on. I really can't fault the place, since Daniel moved over from Sante which was my then favourite Ola soon came to take over the mantle. Yes there are many other great places out there with great food in Singapore, even other good tapas places but at Ola I can go and sit there all night and enjoy everything at other places it is less comfortable, people sat on top of one another or hanging around right next to you waiting for your table.. I am sure eventually we will go to one of the thousands of places in town and go wow this is great too but until then Ola is my number 1 for overall ambience, service and food experienc
5
Treated to an array of extremely tasty tapas selected for us by Chef Daniel Chavez with nicely paired wines. Excellent service. If only a couple of you I highly recommend sitting at the bar so can watch the Chefs in action.
2
I decide to enjoy the happy hour + complimentary tapas.My beer was 9$ and i wait 15mn to received any tapas ??? after waiting so long for a tapas, someone came with a mini mini mini gaspacho with a mini spoon as well ! Thats it ! it was my tapas. if they pretend to be some kind of spanish restaurant they need to check whats happen in madrid or barcelona or even in other place ! I cant believe it. and the worst is...i saw 2 people having just a glass of red wine and they get better tapas than myself ! Great attitude. Some people get different tapas maybe the way they dress ;) anyway...happy hours sucks...sorry.i had much more great experience in many other place in singapore. Find another place for an happy hour coz im not really happy ;
2
I was disappointed at my previous visit to Ola Cocina. The waiters were a bit clueless, and the food fairly average, which was surprising given the pedigree of the chefs. I returned recently; the experience certainly suffered by comparison with the Spanish restaurants I've been to in the last 9 months in Madrid, Barcelona and London, but it was surprisingly bad! Service has improved, but the food was distinctly mediocre. The paella was downright bad - too dry and lacking flavour. Nearby Catalunya is definitely better, and not much more expensive
5
I had a business lunch at Ola Cocina Del Mar last Friday and it was the second time that I ate there. I thought my first visit was just luck when the tapas we ordered were almost as good as what I have had in Barcelona, but then again, last Friday, I was blown away with how delicious our food was. This place is a little gem in the CBD! When I asked our server about the chef, he told me he was from Peru and then paused to go ask the chef to come over to our table for a chat. Daniel Chavez is the real deal. He was genuinely interested in what we liked about our meal and was so pleased that we had enjoyed it. He even gave us his card to say we should call if we had any special requests the next time. I HIGHLY recommend this place!
5
Ola is a fantastic place , specially if you like fresh fish and seafood.been there many time and quality is always at the same high level even its busy during lunch.Daniel Chavez the chef is a perfect fit for this place and knows how to handle his great kitchen team.will be back soon.if you are 2 or 3 person sit on the counter and watch the chefs preparing your meal

We ( my husband and me ) are ardent foodies. We don’t shy from planning our holidays and weekends around food. So it is strange that we missed Cocina till now, more so considering it is in the same building as my husband’s office. The restaurant is neither pretentious nor sophisticated- no flashy lights or signage – rightfully so as their food speaks for itself. The interior is quite tastefully done. It is a gamble having a completely open kitchen in a closed restaurant but it works very with Cocina. Earlier non complementary reviews about service are completely unfounded. When we went the restaurant was completely full but we never felt un attended.Now about the food what this place is all about – there is nothing we did not like. The restaurant has a standard menu and daily specials. The specials are a trifle expensive but worth every penny. The Tapas were good but not outstanding. But what I will go back for is the suckling pig and the paella. We have toured Spain and eaten at most rated restaurants – But the sucking pig in Cocina beats many rated restaurants in Cataluña. Its roasted to perfection, the skin is crispy , the fat beneath melted away, the meat tender and fork ready. The Squid Ink Paella was perfect (wish the portion is larger) so was the Gazpacho (I hate tomato soup).Special mention should be made of the chef Daniel Chavez. Humble and down to earth, he will come to your table check about the food himself. You can also see him in action in his kitchen. He sent us complimentary desert which was lip smacking.A trifle expensive , we paid S$150 for two without wine. But it was worth every penny! I am definitely coming back
4
Today was the second time we have been to Ola and like the first time we were impressed. Simple food done incredibly well with so much attention and yet with so little fuss.The wine list is adequate without being overbearing and the service is first class. The only only thing we have a huge problem with is the distance to the toilets which is bordering on the ridiculous for such a first class restaurant. If you can cross your legs however or not consume too much wine it's pretty tough to beat for excellent Spanish fare
5
A lot of restaurants in Singapore pretend to be many things and most of the time they're trying too many styles at the same time, with a poor result, or sometimes just lack of expertise or service.OLA is exactly the opposite. The level of service is simply the best. A lesson in that area for most restaurants in Singapore. Attention to detail is there, meals are brought in the right order, at the right moment, and good questions are asked at the right time.Prices may be considered in the high-end, but what you get in return is simply exceptional.I've been there maybe 20 times and haven't been deceived once. Even though you think you know what to expect from time to time, you will be amazed every time.To be tried at least once
2
Admittedly we came with strong recommendations from friends but it was a serious disappointment. Sat at the counter and that was the first mistake as the team was dipping uncooked croquetas into liquid egg and batter right in front. Don't sit at the counter, this place was not designed for it.The team didn't show enthusiasm in their work. The service was slick in a superficial way. Kitchen team was so eager to close by 10pm that you felt you were holding them back.Food was the biggest disappointment and clearly inferior to other new tapas joints in town. It was good but not something you would write home about. Chef wasn't interested in providing a good experience but only speaking Spanish to fellow countrymen.For the price it sadly fell far short of expectations.
4
In a country where most diners are used to expecting a glitzy or funky exterior to accompany fine dining, this restaurant turned out to be a visual surprise. Its easy to walk past the restaurant and mistake it as a bistro as its done simply, without much fanfare and in very dark wood colours.What you get instead is a comfortable and cozy restaurant, with a fully open kitchen, and a warm ambience. Chef Pepe was there to helm the restaurant and its quite a sight to see the open kitchen and the chefs preparing the food. Sitting at the counter seats would give you this view. But the most important part of the evening - the food. We were provided some complimentary starters by the chef which was a deep fried prawn head. Never thought I would eat prawn heads but this one tasted simply awesome and started our evening in the right tone.Between the 2 of us, we tried the gazpacho, the octopus, ceviche, the potato and leek soup and the special tapas of the day which was scallop. All of it was excellent. The ceviche and the gazpacho is particularly interesting with a beautifully refreshing taste which packed a punch.For mains, we had the paella as well as the fish of the day. The paella was beautifully done. In many places, the seafood lands up being somewhat overcooked and buried in the taste of the rice and the sauce. Here, the seafood is all separately cooked and placed on top of the rice. This kept the taste of the seafood pure and simple without being masked by the taste of anything else. What is cooked inside the paella instead is chicken and some sausages, which added some interesting flavours to it. The fish, was pan fried - kept simple and flavourful - probably a little too simple but definitely fresh.This is on the whole a nice place to go to for great food, without digging too deep into the pockets. Ambience is cosy and staff are warm and friendly. We like how the restaurant is unpretentious and focuses on what is most important - great food and great service
5
Happy hour drinks and tapas at the bar, excellent. Service is good and tapas is just great. Great way to spend an hour or two after work.
4
Coming from the very familiar Osvaldo, we had very high expectations and were not disappointed. The ambience is non pretentious and cozy. Wait staff very knowledgeable and could described the ingredients and how they are cooked. Very impressive by Singapore standards. Food was very good. The suckling pig was life changing. Very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ceviche was very refreshing and tasty. The mushroom was disappointing, too much lemon juice, which made it sour. We would go back
5
Very intimate restaurant, with a excellent array of Mediterranean dishes. Staff was very warm, owner greeted us, many little appetizers between courses, beautifully prepared suckling pig. Outstanding all around experience. While it may be a bit more of a challenge to get to by taxi during rush hour, it is very convenient to Marina Bay Sands, if your are in that area. Pricey, but worth it.
5
Very authentic Spanish outfit, it just feels like you have walked into a restaurant in Spain the minute you get in. Food is superb, tasty and excellent quality, and the service very attentive. Might be a bit toppy, but not expensive for what you get. Will be going back, again

We were looking forward to go for dinner there after having gone for lunch there, but it was unfortunately overpriced for the quantity of food available. Some of its competitors are providing as good quality for a more reasonable pricing, added to that the fact that the lamb was very undercooked. Even if I would be entertaining on company expense I wouldn't go back

I find it bizarre that some people focus on the restaurant not having flashing lights outside as a reason to find fault, if you have your eyes open you find it easy enough, it's 20 metres from the front doors afterall. Everything about Ola is subtle other than the quality. It is a restaurant that works off reputation and does little advertising, it doesn't need to. Ola insulates you from its' outside environment giving it a character all of its' own.Accordingly, we were a little dubious about dining in the Marina Bay Financial Centre on a Saturday night but the whole point of Ola being so discrete is that you have no sense of being in an office block once you're there.Pepe runs the kitchen as supremely as ever and sitting at the counter (unless you're in a big group) is highly recommended to get a sense of what is going on and just how much care and attention goes into the cuisine.The standard of tapas is excellent and innovative (we had an excellent Peruvian dish for instance on Saturday) and the mains are very good also.The wine list could be more extensive but it is priced ok for a place of this standard. Our only gripe would be the fact that there are no self contained bathrooms meaning you have to walk an inordinate distance to a communal office block toilet. It's a perennial problem in Singapore and a constant pain in the proverbial.That aside, Ola provides a top class Spanish option and we would thoroughly recommend it and will be back for sure. Either couples, business or big groups it really does cater for everyone

I've been to Ola quite a few times and I generally enjoy it although there are times when it is a bit inconsistent - I often order the same things. Sure, I've had just as good or better in Spain, but that's a long plane ride away. The gambas (get some of the bread to soak up the sauce) and the grilled octopus are particularly good. I also like the mushrooms and the croquette. the potatas bravas at Catalunya is better (one of the few things). I like the paella, but that said, I've had it slightly undercooked once and overcooked once. So it's a bit inconsistent, but when they get it right (so far they have done that twice for me), it's brilliant. The noodle paella is decent, but I still prefer the normal paella. And the star is the suckling pig.... it's probably the best I've had - crispy on the outside and it also does not have a strong "piggy" taste. It was way better than the suckling pig I had at Catalunya (which had a very strong "piggy" taste) or at Binomio. I prefer Ola a lot more than Catalunya which I thought was not as good, more expensive and pretentious. I feel that Ola is a bit more like eating at mama's kitchen type of feel. While it's not dirt cheap, I feel it is good value for money - at least you leave happy. Also, if you feel adventurous, you can just leave it to Pepe to order for you

First, the restaurant signage is too nondescript. We walked past the door twice before we were directed to it by a security staff. Same issue that my 2 friends encountered. Like a lucky plaza shop, strange that a supposedly high end tapas restaurant seem shy to market it's existence.Anyway having spent a long holiday in Barcelona just eating at the michellin restaurants there, we consider ourselves a bit of an authority of new nouveau Spanish cuisine and the wannabes.Reno inside was cosy and moody. Service staff were knowledgeable and friendly as we exchanged tips on spanish cuisine ESP Barcelona.We ordered the gambas or prawns with garlic chilli, scallops, ham Croquettes, iberico ham tapas, paella. Supposed to be staffed by ex- santi chefs (santi being one of our favourite chefs esp having visited his main 2 star sant celoni), but overall we spent about $300 for 4 pax with 1 glass is Spanish house wine. Had 4 deserts.Conclusion : food was nondescript like the mAin entrance, certainly do santi no justice. There is just no flair or wow in any of the dishes and it was not memorable but e restaurant can count itself lucky that is can rely on its premier location and feed high end financiers but end of the day, we will only return to a restaurant for good food, not location. And in this case, we probably won't return unless ,,,,,,For the money, the mood, the wow, the service,,,,Catalunya is the best Spanish restaurant in Singapore ESP for those who know how to appreciate molecular cuisine

Very cosy place in the middle of CBD. Great style in furniture and decorative elements.it was a Sunday night (difficult to find open places in Singapore) and all the Forlino's family was there. The owner passed by the tables introducing and giving suggestions.Food excellent, specially tapas: Garlic prawns (Gambas al ajillo) number 1!Paella was very good, but not the best in the world (considering also that we are in Asia and not in the heart of Barcelona).Spanish wine was a sorprise! Super!I will come back for sure!Andre

Ola Cocina Del Mar is part of a group of restaurants in the CDB that also include Amarone, No Menu and Private. It is the only Spanish restaurant in the group. Review based on 2 visitsWhat we enjoyed- the grilled seafood tapas (octopus, prawns, fish etc) were nicely done - very nice balance of natural juices with just enough spices to add flavor but not overwhelm.- jamon tapas- gazpacho - lots of flavours that held our attention- paella (squid ink) - very well done- good selection of wine- chef Pepe has a good sense of humour and patience to explain the foodWhat we found average- roast suckling pig. Skin not quite as crisp, nor the meat as tender as we would have liked (or come to expect from Singapore restaurants). The place fills up pretty quickly and reservations are highly recommended, especially if you are a big group.If dining as a couple, you might wish to dine at the counter as this would give you a wonderful view of the open kitchen. In summary, good Spanish staple, but expect to pay a lot more than what you would have to in Spai
