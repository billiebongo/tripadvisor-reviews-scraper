Reasonable price and has a very family-warmth environment. Has been visiting the eatery outlet and the staff is also friendly

Drive past this eatery almost daily on the way home, but never visited before as it is on the other side of the estate and there are a couple of Thai restaurants nearer home.We decided to take a walk there last evening and we were glad we did. The decor, staff and, more importantly, food are authentic and we were delighted with the dishes we ordered. We had kap pad tom yum, or tom yum fried rice, and it was delicious, as was the pad mee si ew, or bee hoon. Both had wok hei, and brought us back, at least for a few minutes, to dining at Bangkok's small eateries. We also ordered fish cakes, which were home made and tasty. The cucumber soup was nice, though we felt the meat needed slightly more seasoning.We also ordered iced teas, which were refreshing though a little sweet.All in all, it was a great meal and was not too expensive. Dinner for two came up to around $30
