an old school Chinese bakery that has stood the test of time.owners could be a little grouchythey serve the best Kueh dada - pandan flavored crepe wrapped around fresh coconut shavings - in Singapore.Filing is fresh and juicy. As no preservatives are used, you can't keep these overnight tho.Other cakes and pastries are just as yummyOh yes, they are very affordable to

Everyone should try their 1) kaya pandan cake - fragrance of panda lingers in your mouth and one good thing is you can keep for few days 2) kueh dardar 3) fruit pound cake - moist , light and not too sweet 4) Chinese New Year goodies Misses mainly their cream puff as it tastes mediocre.

The kueh here is very very old school feel, just like what i could find when i was young, i had the ondeh ondeh and a green sponge cake like item, was so fragrant with coconut and the gula meleka. I didnt try the rest of items. Will be back to try agai

I love old school bakeries, I can't ever walk past one without taking a look around inside.Chanced upon this place when I was in the neighborhood, picked up a box of apple pies ($6 for 2 slices). Wish I got more! They were delicious, ate both slices in one sitting and still wanted more.Store was crowded while I was there and I felt rushed to order and move along. The line made it difficult for a first timer to really look at the selection and decide what to get. I'm not very familiar with the offerings so I picked something that I knew. Will try the other items if I ever get a chance to return

Kueh Dardar is definitely must have, only costs $0.9! I used to have Kueh Dadar at Bengawansolo, and it costs $1.5! I also had Kueh Salat, Lemper Udang and Ayam , egg tart, putu Ayu, all are very good, and the price is really reasonable. I also heard other costumers say that their cakes are good, will go back again and try more

This small local bakery is just around the corner from the fancy, western style Tiong Bahru bakery and coffee shop. Pick up some delicious egg or pineapple tarts, sticky rice cakes, pandan flavoured sponge cake or a fancy decorated cream cake to take home for special occasions. My favourites were the little coconut filled pandan pancakes for less than $1 eac

You have to be quick here as everybody knows how good this place is, so stuff runs out. The lightest cakes, yummy pineapple tarts (the real thing) and the best kueh radar ever. It's light and fluffy with just enough coconut and just enough sugar. Get a load because one is definitely not enough

This IS home made; hand made; definitely a rare but delicious range of pastries, nonya cakes and a very friendly owner, her family and her staff. Sugar is definitely on hold here but this has absolutely no bearing on the quality of the pastries and cakes

Growing u p in the East of Singapore where there are lots of Peranakan food, I have eaten lots of Nonya Kuehs in my life. Recently, a friend of mine got me Nonya Kuehs from this shop (which I confess, never knew it existed) The Kueh dar dar here puts me on Cloud 9. Ondeh Ondeh is excellent too. Today, I made the unprecedented move of seeking this shop out, due to craving for the awesome kueh dar dar. From onwards, this is the only place I will ever waste calories on Nonya Kuehs. If u are lazy to drive, there's a direct bus stop at the block.

Whenever we happen to be in the Tiong Bahru area, we will make a quick stop here to get their egg tarts, cream puffs and kueh kueh, such as ondeh ondeh and kueh dada.It is an old style bakery, and the snacks remind us of our childhood. They even have grat chocolate eclairs but those are sinfully decadent, so much so that the wife does not allow us to havemore than one.Around the Lunar New Year, they also sell lovely pineapple tarts
