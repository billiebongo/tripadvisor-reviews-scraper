One of the pricier steamboat restaurants. I think it is worth it considering the quality of the food and the freshness of the ingredients.

Best steamboat have been a regular as I prefer their soup and ingredients over HDL!! ps: I'm not an owner or any affiliation to this shop. Just being honest about it.

The food here is extremely good and very authentic too. The soup base is brewed to perfection and the service is top notch too. There is free wifi usage here and there is also a huge car-park located opposite the restaurant. Not the cheapest but definitely value for money

We where 6 people tonight and the soup was ok. The rest of the components where super expensive. Service was just as good as any coffee shop and the place not clean. Toilet dirty so we really did not understand why this place still exist and can practice unbelievably high prices for Singapore!There are so many better places in town for the same kind of hot pot!

Add whatever you like just like how you eat your usual steamboat. üòçTwo types of dipping sauces are served here. My favourite is the combination of soy sauce, chopped red chilli, spring onions and fried garlic dipping sauce.

Fresh ingredients, good service. All my friends loved the place. More pricey than normal but totally worth it

Soup base made to perfection, hand made items super yummy, but pricing a tad too expensive. Similar pricing like Hai Di Lao.

The soup base was good with reasonable selection of steamboat dishes. We like the cooked food more. Especially the fried brinjal with pork floss.

Usually during the month of CNY, restaurants will increase prices of dishes due to many reasons. We are ok if the price hike is reasonable. My 1st visit was with my client and we ordered from the menu with the prices stated. We were good. However, when we wanted to order the fish porridge, we were told that the price has increased from menu stated price of $30 to $45 (50%) due to fish price increase etc. We were good too and went ahead to order despite feeling that the increase was too much. Total price of dinner was $260 for 4 person. Although the price was a steep, we assume that was the price of steamboat. My 2nd trip was a few days after the 1st trip with my staff for CNY company dinner. I told them that the porridge was not bad and wanted to order the same small size porridge for tasting. 5 mins after placing the order, the waiter came back and told us that there is a price increase for the entire menu + the porridge. We were ok as mentioned that it is usual to have a price hike during CNY. When he quoted us of the price hike, we were surprised with the increase. The same porridge we had last week for $45 which has increased from $30 (50%) was $55 now (83% increase) with the reason of fish price increase. For the rest of the menu, the owner and waiter told us that each dishes will be increased by $2 or $3 depending on the dishes. We felt that the price increase was a ripped off and politely left and headed to another place for dinner. Before we left, we politely told the owner to be more transparent with the pricing by stating it in the menu or put up a general notice for her patrons. She gave us an evil stare and walked away. We concluded the reason why the restaurant was empty during dinner time at 730pm. Well, we felt the need to share so that others will not be placed in a situation during dinner time with a big group and oblige to pay for an expensive dinner. Furthermore, it will also be difficult to change venue with a big group during last min. Cheers

Outside the shop there is a sign thats says "if the food is not good we wont charge you for it." in chinese. Its a refelction of the quality of the food that they serve and it is absolutely one of the best I've ever had

This is by far my most favourite steamboat place to go to! Since prices at this place is pretty pricey, I do not patronize it as much as I would like to.The broth does not contain any MSG which would usually leave you dying of thirst by the end of your meal. Food is fresh and staff are friendly.

It was a surprise find along Joo Chiat. The restaurant is clean n service reasonable. As it was our first visit, they were helpful to what we can order. The price is a little pricy but the ingredients were fresh. The fish balls were really nice. The soup base was good and we tasted and confirmed msg free.

this is my second time at the restaurant and i feel that the standard has dropped. for starters the staff are a little haughty, and not at all polite.the restaurant charges for topping up of soup which in my opinion is crazy for a steamboat.the prices are exhorbitant ($133 for 3 of us for lunch).the food standard has dropped since the last time i visited so i'm also disappointed. totally doesn't justify the cost.

I'm revieiwng as a satisfied repeat customer of this restaurant. I've brought different groups of people there and they all loved it. No exceptions. Sat is their busiest day so if you're a big group (10 persons) it would easier to get a table on a Sun evening
