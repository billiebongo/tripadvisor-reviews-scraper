This is a functional place to get a bowl of Japanese noodle soup with flavours of your choice. Delicious.

one of the better ramen place in Singapore. the broth is thick and flavourful, easily emptied the bowl each time i visit. and the egg is wonderfully done. visited both their restaurant at Novena and Tanglin, prefer the Tanglin ambience better though.

Broth is thick and tasty. Noodles al dente. Egg was a bit overcooked. Pork slice was good and melt in the mouth.

The broth was thick and noodles cooked to my liking. They have add-on set lunches which makes the meal even much enjoyable.

I feel obligated to write a review because this is a really fantastic ramen restaurant that deserves credit. I've been here three times in the past two weeks. That's how good it is. The pork tonkatsu ramen is equally as good as the chicken ramen. The broth for both is super rich and flavorful. Better than other ramen restaurants, even highly rated ones, that I have tried in Singapore. If you appreciate excellent quality ramen, you need to try it

This locate at Tanglin is worth my on going visit as the food and service are good and nice.The Ramen I ate (Noritama-uma) is nice. The chasu is thick but melt in your mouth. The pork soup base is a thick but not to heavy in taste and refreshing or salty.The Gyoza is nice and the inside filling is juicy but not too oily and the skin is not too thick.The karaage (fried boneless chicken) is fleshy deep fried that it is chispy on the outside juicy in the inside and most importantly not oily.They also serve warm or cold water free of charge.Average price per person: S$18-28The service charge are worth giving being attentive can recommend us what is good and clear the table fast too

Very rich soup and very appetizing ramen noodle. The Chasu was roasted and tasted uniquely flavourful. Egg was cooked perfectly. Together they were served as the best ramen I've ever tasted (including the much more expensive one). Service was also prompt and kind. Certainly we will come back for the great tasting ramen

Whenever I think of ramen, I think of Bari-Uma. A hidden gem and very underrated, this one deserves all the accolades for doing their ramen very right. It's a no-frills restaurant with basic service (and Japanese greetings) and some lip-smacking food. The soups are rich and heavy with awesome umami flavour. The noodles are specially made, not those instant-style noodles most ramen places try to sell off. The meat is melt-in-the-mouth tender and it comes together with the veggies to create a really tasty ensemble. Add Nori to the ramen and it becomes even better. They also have some appetizers like Gyoza, Grilled Pork, etc to go along. But, most of that is just the side-show, the ramen are the real deal here. One bowl of their ramen is filling enough in itself. So, if you're craving for some really tasty ramen and have a lot of calories to spare, do try it out and you won't be disappointed

My husband and I went to this Ramen Restaurant one month ago, every dish we ordered was great! We had no complaints at all, service was prompt, friendly & as per order and everything was very tasty and enjoyable. We are great fans of a good ramen and it did not disappoint, as mentioned in previous reviews meat was a little on the low side per serve, but not a big issue, was content when leaving :-) Thumbs Up!!

Ordered their signature dish, Bariuma Nori Tama. Kind of disappointed that it came with only one piece of the thick cut chashu. However, on hindsight, what you see in the picture is what you get (although the egg was served whole, instead of two halves).Soup was flavourful, noodles was springy firm, nori was nice (whether it was eaten dry, or dunked into the soup), egg was good, and the chashu was average.Service was efficient, they were quick to respond to take the order, quick but polite to clean up after finishing your ramen. However, because of the food, it felt rather average
