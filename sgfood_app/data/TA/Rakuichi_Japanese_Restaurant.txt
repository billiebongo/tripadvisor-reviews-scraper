Decided by us to have a group of 9 paxs to end the year with a Japanese meal.
Ordered the rakuichi bento and was very satisfying with starters sashimi sushi yakitori tempura even ice cream for desert. Value for money set meal.

waitresses talking across room and in a rush to clear a $60-70 dish off table, miso taste like instant noodle kind, sashimi not worth the money, wagyu beef have tendon- not properly cutted- over price

Visited this restaurant during lunch and they offered lunch set. Reasonable price for a very decent Japanese meal. Ain't crowded and we have our privacy. I had the "business lunch". Will I return? Yes!!

Most amazing Japanese food I've had for ages. Its so fresh and tasty. We had Toku Sashimi ( Assorted freah sashimi), Wagyu feef teriyaki. We were brought there by friends who reside there. Super lunch

This restaurant has big seating capacity and provided with counter sitting and table siting arrangement. Friendly staff and good varieties of seafood. Chef can prepare what the best season fishes from Japan. I go for Chef creation with beer and sake. Ambience Is great and good for business or family. Sashimi , sushi and grilled fish was fear. It comes with special tank with live fish and oyster... do try the only Japanese restaurant in Dempsey area

Rakuichi is always a must do with visiting children back for the holidays. Lunch is our preferred time, and there are favourite sets to look forward to. The sets come with salad, dessert and a couple of dishes, either dumplings, sushi or miso soup with the main meal. Service is quick and personable.

This is one of those rare places where you can't take pictures of the dishes, because as soon as they touch the table, people are immediately reaching in to try the latest offering. We ordered a lot of food and everything was fresh and delicious. It more than satisfied our sushi craving, and it's definitely on my short list of places to go back to.While you're in Dempsey Hill, walk around - there are delightful store and shops spread out all around.Take note: you may want to make sure you have taxi or car service arranged to take you back from Dempsey Hill. Most of the cabs are heading in the opposite direction (going home) and do not want to take you back to city center. After a frustrating hour waiting and calling from the taxi stand area, we finally reached out to our hotel (thank you Fullerton Bay - best hotel in Singapore!) and they arranged for a car to pick us up

I love coming here because it's so convenient. You can always find parking right outside in the Dempsey Hill area.The place is decent though uninspiring. And the air-conditioning is sometimes a bit warm, but overall it's just... Decent.It's affordable, service is pleasant and the cooking very reliable. It's not mind blowing which is why it gets only 4/5 in my rating but don't let that deter you. The aburi sets here are always good and well priced, so aburi lovers can eat to their heart's content and not have to worry about the consequences to their wallets

Heard so much about Rakuichi from the media and friends. Went with my boyfriend today and we ordered a mini course and Rakuichi Bentou set. The chawamushi was too bland. Sushi was average. Only after we paid then realized that the 'free' appetizer was also part of the total bill. Overall experience was a pretty disappointing one.Though service was good, we won't head back agai

After reading a few reviews here, we went to Rakuichi expecting yummy japanese food. It was I think my most disappointing culinary experience in Singapore! I called earlier in the day to make a reservation and was told that they were fully booked. We decided to try a walk in. We got there and they seated us immediately. I expected "nice" restaurant considering the area its in...The dining room is small, very brightly lit - not inviting at all.We ordered Miso Soup, which was the best part of the meal!Tuna and Salmon Sashimi - the tuna was inedible, (I took one bite and had to leave it) the Salmon was ok - it was thick slices of average grade salmon. Hamachi Salad - was pretty okOyster and vegetable in Miso broth - most unappetizing looking dish I have ever seen - terrible, inedible.Tai Carpaccio - sliced snapper with truffle. How can anyone go wrong with truffles, but the chefs at this restaurant managed very well to ruin this too.The service was crazy - they brought all the food together 10 minutes after we ordered it. I am not kidding we got there at 9:15 and ate, paid the check and were in our car at 9:55.Total ripoff

A business lunch that was very reasonably priced ($28), yummy sushi. Crispy delicate tempura, and wickedly good miso, but the standout was the puffer fish - thin strips caramelised perfectly. A real treat!

I always love this restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is excellent. I always come away from this restaurant completely satisfied and looking forward to my next visit.

I never come out of Rakuichi disappointed. The food looks good and tastes good - those sushi pieces seared were my favorite anytime. The dining room is small but the table is comfortably big for a family of 4. Located at Dempsey, I love it for its bucolic feel and ample parking place that is also free ( rare near downtown Singapore ). It is also a short ride from Orchard Road.Service is prompt but we do not feel hurried. When the 3 of us wanted to order 3 bento sets and a sashimi set, we were advised to cut back one set because it was too much for us, which was thoughtful. We ended up sated and not horribly full.For the huge spread, the bill came up to SGD$220. Since I paid with UOB Visa, I was given a $20 voucher to be used for the next visit ( weekdays ). Just as well ! After the happy meal, I look forward to the next one very soon

It is hard to find bad food in Singapore, and even harder to find bad Japanese food. But if you want to find it, come here. Desultory waitstaff. A starter made from tinned tuna. Unagi cooked to mush. We were happy to have only ordered a few things to start and even happier to be out of here

Their menu is not cheap, not when you can find food for more than one third the price in Singapore. But for a Japanese restaurant in Dempsey, it's reasonable. My family likes this place, and we visit every so often because, like the title implies, the food is good.There is a lot of competition among Japanese restaurants in Singapore, and so the prices tend to be a good indicator of the quality of the restaurant. For Rakuichi's pricing, it serves better than average food. They have a decent lunch set menu as well, both at Dempsey and at their other restaurant in Far East Shopping Centre. Dinner is more expensive, but with a wider range and more complex flavours. It is not the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore, but it's delicious food nonetheless.Service-wise, Rakuichi does well. The waitresses/waiters are friendly and always willing to offer suggestions on what to order a la carte. Food does not take long to arrive, and the staff is attentive. One thing to note is that they may provide a small starter without you ordering which might be charged; if you don't want to pay $5 or so per person for it, ask before eating. As the tables are located in various rooms, it does not get too noisy and gives a cosy feeling. Normally we would make reservations, because finding a table for dinner in Dempsey, especially on a weekend, is always difficult.Getting there is a little troublesome if you use public transport, as buses don't go into Dempsey Hill and there is no train station nearby. Parking is an aggressive challenge, but usually you'd get a lot eventually. The ambient of the Hill is, however, worth the effort even if there is not much to do per se, especially if you're looking for cheap entertainment. The Hill is most vibrant in the evening, when all the restaurants and cafes are open

The set-up was nice, warm and comfy. You can opt for aircon or non-aircon, and there is a smoking area too. The lighting was dim but just enough for you to appreciate the food served and at the same time, gave us the romantic atmosphere. The staff was very attentive. She knows what we need before we even call her. And the food, it was spectacular. Prepared in a very presentable manner which enhances the appetite. It was a sumptuous dinner at a reasonable price. For Japanese food lovers, this place is highly recommended

I was hanging out at Dempsey area that day, and in the mood for some Japanese fare, hence Rakuichi Japanese Restaurant came into my mind. A beautiful Japanese restaurant decorated in rich modernistic meets authentic Japanese design, this restaurant nestles behind some thick canopy, hence giving it a very "in nature" feel; and we were seated alfresco since inside was full house.We shared the Rakuichi Bento (SGD$48.60) consisting of an assortment of Sashimi, an array of different types of Sushi, some Tempura items, skewered pork and skewered beef (Yakitori) and some sides of corn, edamane and sauteed mini shrimps. The sashimi was rather fresh and the sushi was lovely - we enjoyed the variety. The tempuras were crispy and the Yakitori pork was so succulent and delicious.Following the above, we also shared the Kaki Totenabe (SGD$16.00) - oysters cooked in miso soup - with tofu and vegetables. This was a really delicious dish with piping hot broth that was sumptuous, and the oysters were fresh and chewy - perfect for a rainy night as such.Lastly, the Aburi Salmon Ebi Avocado sushi roll (SGD$12.00) - combination of my favorite things such as salmon roe, shrimp and avocado. The pearl rice was fresh and of the right texture, and the seafood items were palatable. We were very full by the time this was served, but we strived to finish it because it was simply too tasty.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-rakuichi-japanese-restaurant.htm

Service was good and a very nice restaurant on the whole. I have not tried Japanese food before and was not disappointed at all. I went for the set menu for about $48 SGD so I could sample a few things in one go. Dempsey on the whole is the place to go if you wish for plenty of choice for dining. I would fully recommend here

Our family love coming here, usually for lunch. The lunch sets are great value and the food is very fresh. The aburi sushi platter is a favorite, but their tempura, grilled meats and sea food are all of very good quality. The service has always been very efficient. The atmosphere is also quiet, we've not seen too many noisy children running around

This was our second visit and this time we went there to celebrate a birthday with some friends. The food was average to good but the service was terrible. All of us were sick the next day and had symptoms that ranged from vomiting to diarrhea. I am not saying that this was from the food at Rakuichi as all of us who were sick also had ice cream at Ben & Jerry's a stones throw away.Given the prices and lacklustre service and the fact that there are many great Japanese restaurants in Singapore to choose from, I would give Rakuichi a miss

We went on wet Tuesday night for dinner.Though they were busy they gave us undivided attention as usual.As the fish had just come in that day we ordered the sashimi platter for 4. It was sublime, with individual portions for 4. The uni was super fresh with a generous portion in each bowl ( 1 each!) and so were the rest of the fish. We also had the semi grilled sushi which is a feature of the restaurant.Worth every penny!

We went to Rakuichi based on the good reviews we have read. We went to the branch at Oasia at Novena. Unfortunately, we had a poor time there. We ordered their rainbow set, sushi set and tempura rice meal. The sashimi was served first and of average taste, they forgot to bring the wasabi. We followed up and it was served in couple of minutes. Then we waited for a hour for the rest of our order to arrive. We were sitting right at the bar and followed up with the waitress. We had the misfortune of overhearing their conversation with the chef refusing to do our order because he forgot. The waitress urged him a little more and he relented after laughing. We proceeded to request for the cancellation of the order with same waitress and she had the gall to tell us our order was delayed because it was specially prepared and the preparation is long. We would have just appreciated an apology for the lateness, but lying to your customers is unacceptable. It doesn't help that the tempura was small and soggy, the miso soup was overly salty and the sushi was just average. Just an overall disappointing experience

There's nothing worse than eating sushi that taste a day old! At Rakuichi - it feels like fish is freshly caught and served. I don't even eat hamachi with soya sauce and wasabe here. The place is upbeat like most restaurants are at Dempsey Hill on weekend nights and can be quiet on weekday nights. It does feel a little cramp inside so we prefer outdoor seating for a quieter, comfy casual feel. We have ordered off the menu better leaving it to the sushi chef to dish up whatever he feels is best for the evening. Prices are well worth it for such guaranteed freshness and service. It tickles me very much on my first visit to see sperm (of fish) on the a la carte menu - something which was a half hour dinner conversation piece for my 16 year old daughter and I for a good part of the evening. So a perfect 10 for creating good ambience. LOL

If you are in the neighbourhood, this is a great place for a light and quick lunch. Rakuichi is a well established Japanese restaurant that has an la carte menu plus a variety of sets each day for lunch as well as dinner. The lunchtime sets are great value. My favorite sushi set is the Rainbow Set. Each piece of sushi is made of a different type fish, lightly seared and then drizzled with a different colour sauce, hence the name Rainbow. The sushi set comes with some small side dishes which complete the appetising meal. Reservations are recommended

I was introduced to this restaurant by my church counsellor on this Tuesday. The dining hall is of reasonable size, and as we went there quite early, at 11:30 a.m., the restaurant was not that packed yet, and so it was quiet and ideal for us to chat. It only started getting busier later on at after 12:30 p.m. or so. The only difficulty is that I could not find the entrance to the restaurant, and so had to ring them up, to ask for its exact location. Luckily, my church counsellor spotted me in the nearby distance and brought me into the restaurant. My church counsellor had the September set. I tried their grilled sushi on her plate, which was surprisingly tasty!!!!!! I myself am allergic to seafood items, and so had the Wagyu beef set instead. The beef is tender, the rice is of a surprisingly large portion which I could not finish.  The dessert the seasame ice cream is definitely delicious.  I never know that such restaurant existed, and so will definitely bring my mom and husband there for a meal on another weekday

I went to Rakuchi on a Saturday night and my colleague told me 'if you are going there on a weekend, be sure to make a reservations!' As advised, I made a reservation. Indeed it was a full house on a Saturday night ! It was my 2nd time there and i like there grilled sushi served with different sauce per piece. I like the way the sushi was served. My friend was not feeling very well that night thus does ordered udon but does not want it to be paired with fried stuff. The waitress offered to customized my friend's udon and they give him sliced dish udon instead ! A great way of personalized service!Since it was a saturday night, the waitresses were quite tied up with the crowd and the service speed was not as prompt as when I visited on a weekend. No doubt, the food was great and the 2 guests that I brought there liked the food alot

I was introduced to Rakuichi by my cousin. The one I prefer is on Orchard Rd. The food is fresh, the service is excellent, however the restaraunt is small so i would recommend making reservations. I brought some friends and they loved it , and even said it was better than most of the places they visited in Japan!My favourite is the Rakuichi Bento and the black sesame ice cream. Well worth a visi

This is my Singapore favorite for fresh full flavor sashimi and other Japanese delights. Always friendly and attentive staff, the freshest food that always tastes great and delights my guests. Not cheap but still value. Could work up wine list. Don't confuse the Novena restaurant of same name (too pedestrian and thus overpriced)

Rakuichi is located in the charming area of Dempsey Road but tucked away in the corner at Block 10 - of what used to be an army camp. There are some large private rooms and a reasonable sized main seating area. They have a good selection of japanese style set lunches - which have generous portions and leave you quite full! Try their aburi style sushi. Worth a visit for an informal family meal or with friends
