Prices are steep considering the portions of the mains. Forgettable at best. The sides were somewhat better.

It is always nice to come back to this place for a break from shopping. The friendly staff and filling portions will entice you to come back.

The 2 ladies helped us with the orders and made good suggestions. The food was good and we were superbly pleased with the attention given.

Simple faire made with fresh ingredients and presented well.Some of the servers were rather green and inexperienced but I would still give them an A for effort.Make sure that you go before 6pm to get a good table where you can people watch.Going early also means that you can enjoy the house wine for just S$10 per glass (happy hour ends at 8pm)

Quite unbelievable how bad the service was! The poor waitress was untrained and could barely understand what was being ordered. We had 3 orders wrong but took them anyway since the wait was so long.The food however wasnâ€™t too bad at all - Lobster roll, eggplant caviar and iberico pork pasta were pretty good. The pandan geniose cake was unusual and delicious.I do hope they train the staff and improve service

I was there with a friend. Food was OK but service is quite bad. Service staff do not care if you need help or not. Everytime we need help, we have to literally raise our voices because they do not even bother to check as and when if we are well taken care of. Too much effort just to get a menu . Even when we managed to get the staff attention, staff was unapologetic and gave a nonchalant attitude. We are the only customers there. I don't need to explain why

We came on a Saturday afternoon, after 2pm, where there were only 1 or 2 tables occupied. The service staff was very polite and took time to explain the menu to us. We were quite hungry and informed her the dishes could all come together. The snow peas came after about 15 mins, followed shortly by the soup. After that, it was another 25 mins before the fish, kale salad and quinoa came. Between that time, the manager asked us if everything was OK (it wasn't) and she had to literally run to the kitchen to check what was going on. It appeared the same thing happened to the next table. The food was average and a little on the pricey side. Manager offered us choux pastry as apology. Not sure if I would be coming back. While the manager and staff were great, the kitchen seems unable to cope, even on (or maybe because of) an empty Saturday afternoon.

2 of us took the Set Lunch menu for convenience. Starters were a creamy soup with mussels and a roasted roma tomato tarte tartin which I took. It turned out to be sliced tomatoes with a dollop of some cream and sat on a pale round pastry! I told the waitress it wasnt what a tart tartin should be and further more to tomatoes were NOT roasted! She agreed and took it back. 10 mins went and that same tomato dish came back!! Decided not to take it and told this waiter to go on with the main. He apologised that it was a new kitchen team! My main was a " locally farmed French poulet leg" and was told it was baked. The leg seemed to me fried and the meat was dry inside!When they served dessert which was some choux pastry, we were given a slice of some sponge cake topped with some sort of chocolate cream. Why would I want to eat another dessert!!I felt the staff should have offered me to take another starter from the ala carte menu instead of giving me another dessert!! After lunch I called to speak to the owner who called back later in the evening. He stressed that the ala carte menu would have given me a different experience. Well, if the set lunch cannot be up to what it says on the menu, how can the new kitchen team manage to prepare the so many ala carte dishes? It would be a disaster!Anyhow the owner offered to give me a full refund back. However I will never go back again. A colleague coincidentally told me the next day that she was going to have dinner there. I told her of my bad experience that I never had before

Service was below average. Restaurant manager was unable to speak properly, let alone make a recommendation. Serving portions were tiny, I walked away hungry even after 3 courses. A $1 tofu (in supermarket) with some sauce was charged $19 - there was not even a slight effort to disguise the fact that the tofu was not from its original packaging.Totally not worth it, don't waste your time. Money better spent elsewher

We had put in the remark of our reservation that we would like to have the advertised WGS menu. We received a booking confirmation, so assumed all was ok. Only when we got there, we were told that the set menu was no longer available. The regular menu only had limited choices. As we had come there for a special occasion, we eventually decided to leave and celebrate elsewhere.

A good place to spend a quiet afternoon at. Definitely give the chia berry pudding a try when you go there.

We came here for afternoon tea. There was a nice selection of beverages and pastries.
The ambient was very cosy and relaxing. If you sit by the window, you will have a nice view of the busy Orchard Road.

Good options for vegetarian. Wouldn't order the Salmon sandwich again. Almond-Coconut cake was fantastic.

This is a great restaurant and a demonstration of how to eat healthy, tasty and great food.
The grilled barramundi was super tasty and spicy, the biscuits are great, very good also the tofu.
Well done!

Tucked in a quiet corner of The Heeren Robinsons, the location is great for a convenient yet quiet night out. Food was not fantastic but acceptable. Nice atmosphere and good service.

I ordered truffle spaghetti and my associate a chicken dish. The spaghetti and the cream are too thick. Everything just fall out of expectation. Will not patronize again.
5
Quality, taste and presentation of food was great though choices on the menu were limited. Prices a bit steep. My friend and I each had a starter, main and we shared dessert. The bill came up to $158. There were no other customer other than us so service was good, staff were courteous and well mannered

My wife and I wanted a night out and came across Angela May in a web search. It looked interesting so gave it a try. I must say, it was quite difficult to find as it was actually hidden in Robinson's store itself. That may be why it was not well patronised. We looked at the standard menu which was the main complaint that it was rather skimpy without many enticing choices. We chose the World Gourmet Summit fixed menu and were not disappointed. We started with the foie gras creme. It had light touch and the gula melaka gave it a lovely base. Presentation was excellent. The beetroot stained quail eggs however were more a visual presentation than interesting taste wise. The asparagus spears and the quail eggs didnt complement each other that well and something stronger needs to balance out the relatively bland asparagus. However the caramelised crayfish tails were outstanding. The red wine veloute was rich and enhanced the crayfish tails. Too bad the crayfish tails were so small.. The highlight was the beef tenderloin, which was a decent size but done beautifully to perfection. The mint salad with a hint of chili was a brilliant idea and really did wonders for the dish. One of the best and most flavourful tenderloins I had! The dessert was refreshing and cleaned the palate with the citrus flavours and calamansi base. The service was attentive but not intrusive, and overall it was well worth the experience. At SGD 68++ per head, this was a bargain compared to the exorbitant prices being charged for fine dining

I met a friend here for brunch this morning and we were both highly impressed with the taste and quality of the food. My friend loved her chocolate and almond quinoa pudding, and the french toast I had was spectacular. When it first arrived my expectations were pretty low, it was simply two pieces of french toast and some raspberry jam, but it was easily one of the best french toasts I've had. The bread used to make it was similar to a brioche but made with olive oil, and had been soaked in custard to the point of being soft and almost creamy. The homemade jam was lovely and overall the dish was delicious. We also each tried a tomato ricotta savoury choux pastry, which was divine, and a piece of the gluten free coconut almond cake, which is now on my list of favourite cakes in Singapore! It was perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and had a beautiful moist texture from the almond flour. The buttercream frosting was smooth and added just the right amount of sweetness of the dish. Not too sweet, and the perfect end to our meal. The service was also excellent. When I made my booking I mentioned looking forward to the french toast, which the restaurant managed (I think that's who he was) remembered and commented on when he seated me. He made some great recommendations, and even went out of his way to introduce us to Angela on our way out so that we could pass on our compliments to her directly with regards to the amazing food. The other two servers who waited on us were lovely and attentive as well. Overall a great experience, and I'm already planning a return visit for the afternoon tea. Highly recommended

Went there for Valentine's day dinner and ordered the Valentine's day menu. Place was well decorated and had great ambience although finding the restaurant was a little hard as it wasn't very conspicuous. Food was good and interesting especially the strawberry and beetroot soup. I can see the chef trying to fuse Asian flavours into the meal. Overall, a great experience
5
The food here is very under rated. Although the menu is not huge everything is tasty and has a twist.
No huge portions and the truffle spaghetti is excellent. Staff are friendly and service always good.

I love this place for lunch or dinner. The flavors are a divine combination of western dishes with a delicate Thai/Asian influence. Service is excellent and friendly.

Enjoyed an afternoon here. The puffs were delicious. Food's little on the pricey sode but that's expected given the location.

After being on our feet for hours shopping, we decided to take a break at Angela May's eatery.
I found the food delicious, service attentive and ambience cosy. Will definitely go back again.

The food just tasted amazing. We had the vegetarian course but every single item on the menu made my taste buds dance.

可怕的沙拉 三十新幣只有ㄧ點蘋果跟超小蝦沒有菜，嚇死人了
在新加坡，這種沙拉只值五塊錢
問員工還說 我們本來就只有這個大小
Order the shrimp salad, charged me 30SGD only little Apple n three pathetic small shrimp. Will never come here again.

The menu on paper is a lot more exciting than it actually turns out. The food is in fact rather boring, and in fact I suspect anyone could turn out the same food in their own kitchen. Even the presentation needs a bit of work. Disappointing.

We were there on a Sunday noon time near Christmas Eve and hardly had to take reservations, food was generally good, a little pricey for certain items. We had the high tea set, fish, smoked salmon sandwich, truffled pasta. We enjoyed the food in general, the fish was my fav. Limited brunch menu for a Sunday as bfast is until noon only
4
The food here is delicious. At least what I ordered. The emphasis is on fusion but using fresh ingredients. Vegetarians are well looked after as the menu has many options catering to these diners. What surprised me was the restaurant was deserted early Sunday evening & I felt they deserved better. Service was friendly & competent. I would certainly return.

Was very pleasantly surprised by the complete meal at Angela May. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and her creative twists with the use of ingredients, to elevate the usual dishes. We had the salad and kurobota pork collar, both of which were excellent with the mix of flavours, giving it a refreshing taste. They were also kind enough to make a simple penne pasta dish for the children which was not in the menu. And mash white beans instead of potatoes as a healthier alternative. The price is on the high side though I dare say you do get what you pay for. Definitely recommended to give a try
