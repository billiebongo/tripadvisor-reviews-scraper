Have heard about this place for the longest time, and glad to finally able to eat them. Very traditional Malay rice cakes which is filled with gula Melaka! They are very generous with the sweets! Very fragrant!
Must try!

Managed to make my way to try their famous putu piring and I must say I really love them. Much lighter than the Chinese Kueh Tu Tu. I want putu piring from now on.

I stay nearby, yet didn't get to this place till recently. Unique traditional treat, very sweet. Engaging to watch the making of this while standing in a long queue. Stall is located on the east end of Haig Road Food Centre.

In Haig road the infamous putu piring is sold for only S$2.
It is soft and gula melaka (brown sugar) complement it with the soft dough and it is steamed.
Nice sweet dessert.

A traditional Malay sweet dish that we must buy each time we visit Singapore. This outlet is famous for their product, and we travel to Geylang each time for a feed. We even take a few home with us to Perth to share with relatives. Staff are always friendly even when they are flat out trying to keep up with demand

I like anything with gula Melaka (palm sugar) and thai dish tops it all. The gula Melaka is just sweet enough, 5 piece portion is just right and I'm still amazed at how they managed to make their coconut shaving fluffy. The fragrant of of the pandan leaf makes opening the packet itself satisfying

The ladies work like diligent gnomes steaming tiny individual pots of steamed mung cakes filled with a dollop of brown sugar paste and served with fresh ground coconut and pandan leaves for fragrance and color. They have an A rating. The stall is clean and tables in front are covered. Price is 5 for $2. Ask for no bag and yours will come wrapped in brown paper. There will be a line but don't let that keep you from sampling this treat. Easy fresh

I have tried many putu piring and this is one of the nicest I have ever tried. However, it is also one of the more expensive putu piring at 5 for $2.50. The putu piring's skin is thin and the gula melaka is really nice! The shop that I tried is at 728 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5 which is one of the branch of the main shop at Haig Road

We have visited the stall at Haig Road Hawker Centre for a while now. Every time we come by, there is usually a queue of people waiting to pick up packets of Putu Piring, currently sold for 5 for $2. The staff operating the stall worked like clockwork - each knowing what their respective roles are and they worked non-stop - very much like a production line. The queue moves quickly, unless someone in front of you orders 10 or more packets, which is not unusual.Each piece of putu piring is nicely done, and the pack of 5 is accompanied by a generous heap of grated coconut. Take a bite into it with the coconut when it's fresh, and you will be back for more. You really have to eat this snack on the spot to experience the goodness

Great dessert option in the Haig Road Market & Food Centre!!
Really refreshing to eat this in the muggy weather in Singapore.
The Laksa stall in the Haig Market was also quite good.

Long queue average waiting time more than 45 minutes. It's worth it , they are very nice and well done , filling is pure coconut sugar. Make sure to buy more packet. The best I've eaten. Will go back for more

Really delicious Malay dessert. The brown sugar used for the filling (Gula Melaka) is all melty. It's like a Molton Cake - Malay style. Sometimes the sugar is still a little crunchy. Watch the ladies in action preparing the food.

Grew up with this as a tea time staple. Done to perfection and cheap as well. Queue can be long but well worth the wait. Just remember to buy more than you think you want.

I was enticed to the stall by the smell - putu piring is super delicious here in the stall. It;s a cheap option for the dessert and slightly healthier than just sugar bar. I loved it! Great value for money - 2 SGD per one pack (of 5 slices) only and it;s hypnotising to watch the ladies working on this. Plus, the service is very nice and friendly

Someone recommended we try this so we queued up after our market shopping at Geylang Serai. You get five pieces for $2. They are freshly made and literally hot off the stove, but I found them to be too soft and 'flaky' ie breaks easily. They also had one flavour only. I remember from my childhood days when such stalls used to have several fillings such as grated coconut, peanuts or brown sugar.Ut's okay for a quick and cheap snack. The stall is located within the Teh Tarik coffeeshop on the ground floor near the traffic lights

What is so nice about this stall that it ranks so highly on this forum??Honestly, it's just a very normal putu piring and nothing exceptional about it. It's not that it's bad; it's just that it is very normal with nothing to rave about and not worth the purported queues. The kueh and coconut filling are quite bland; the coconut is dry, and the sugar too sweet (but of course right?)

I have been wanting to try this putu piring for the longest time. One afternoon, I was in the East area on a Saturday and I headed here.I found the stall, which is located at the outer row of stalls facing the out from the food centre. The queue was short, about 5 people deep and I promptly went to join the queue. It’s a well-run operation, with several stall helpers working the process of making the putu piring. Eah has a role to play and they focus on their tasks without any small talk. Do stand on the side and observe their work process. It’s a well-oiled ‘machinery’.A standard order cost $2 for 5 pieces. All are takeaway orders. I ordered two packets.I couldn’t resist and sat down promptly to eat a packet. The putu pirig are nice round discs of flour and they have been steamed. Within is Gula Melaka (Brown Cane Sugar). There was 2 sprigs of pandan leave within the packet, which added a nice pandan flavor to the putu piring. This is unlike other stall who add a piece of pandan leaf below each pputu piring. Over the 5 pieces of putu piring, they sprinkle a good amount of grated coconut. The coconut has been processed, so it doesn’t go bad after a while. It tastes good. It best to eat it on the spot. I had the second packet later that night, and it didn’t taste as good. Recommended
