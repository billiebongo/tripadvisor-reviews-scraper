We ordered olive rice , best one I ever had! We also had Tom yum soup, excellent flavor! Papaya salad and noddles were great ! Over all can’t go wrong here!
5
Beautiful fresh ingredients, served in a very efficient manner despite the restaurant being very busy. Highly recommend the chicken green curry, olive rice and mango/papaya salad.
4
A great place for authentic fine dining. Excellent service with a smile. Great flovors and chef are ready to alter heat of dishes as per request. Desert is great. A bit pricey but a pleasant dining experience.
4
Lots of choices— all very good and authentic. Nice location and ambiance despite being a mall. Pricey
4
A great way to enjoy variety without having to leave your table to refill your plate. The buffet menu features 5-6 dishes in each category -- seafood, meat, poultry, vegetable, vegetarian, rice, noodles, desserts. You choose what you want, and it is cooked brought to your table. The appetisers, soups and desserts come in individual portions. Everything else is for sharing. We asked for small portions, and the chef obliged. Will definitely be returning for more

This is where I question trip advisor as a medium for judging a restaurant. The problem being is that beauty is always in the eye of the beholder. So, when I was a little dubious from the hotel recommendation and the website, I turned to TA. Most comments were overwhelmingly positive. Fine dining, pricey, great reviews all round. So we went with it. To give it average is being kind, in a shopping mall, not a great one either, usual Thai style decor, but aged and lacking character. No real ambiance, and despite attentive staff, they were not offering fine dining service. More like cheap and cheerful Chinese. Food, okay, satay luke warm. Australian beef a bit tough, curry, well it was curry, it was ok. We were told we were lucky to get a table, the restaurant was virtually empty by 9, it was never full. Pricey, not really, not by Singapore standards. More than enough for what it was though. In truth, avoid, there must be better experiences in Singapore.

Stayed around the corner and went for dinner with the family (1 toddler, 1 infant). When walking in we felt a bit misplaced since it looked too upscale inside. All tables are set like in a 5-star hotel. However, since it is located in a mall we sat down and ordered. Service was good and attentive, even having kids cutlery and plates. Food came rather fast and was really delicious. The red curry lamb.was superb and also the pandan chicken was excellent. There was not one dish which let us down and even our kids had a feast. Overall a really good dining experience which comes at a cost in Singapore

We ordered several soups thinking it would be pretty decent portions. I wasn't expecting a big bowl for two. The least was a proper soup bowl befitting of a "fine dining" restaurant... assuming they are fine dining since they call themselves fine Thai cuisine. But when the soup came, I was shocked to see rice bowls containing soups cramped with ingredients with little volume left for actual soup. Coming from a fine dining restaurant background, this presentation was an absolute abysmal. Value aside (obviously no value), the presentation resembled something scooped out of a large bowl at home and served individually. There was nothing fine about it. What made it worse was the tom yum goong was overwhelmingly salty. There was two prawns, about 2 mushrooms in halves and 2 tiny slices of squid in my soup. One of the prawns was not fresh. This was $12++. In all my life of drinking my favourite soup - tom yum goong, this was probably the worst I had in terms of taste, value and presentation. I've had better soup at Thai Express and it looks and taste better than this! As a fine dining restaurant, the food should be served directly to the person and not placed on the lazy susan. White rice was served in the same tiny soup bowl and I saw the server's thumb touch the rice as he served it. That is not fine!I've been to a great fine dining restaurant in Singapore. It is called Thanying at Amara Hotel. Over there, their tom yum soup is legendary and so is their service and presentation which are definitely more fine. Despite not having visited in a while, from my knowledge, they serve their rice in a free flowing manner and beautifully done scooped out from a bowl to your plate to your satisfaction. They don't serve it like they do here - by the tiny bowls where the server has a problem even holding it without touching the rice! Our total bill came up to almost $300 and we didn't order much. Even though I enjoyed the green curry and minced pork with basil, my appetite was just ruined by the bad tom yum goong and soup presentation. A good bowl of tom yum goong IMO defines a truly good Thai restaurant. For good fine Thai food, go to Thanying!

Authentic Thai experiencePatara Thai Restaurant Located at Tanglin Mall, #03-14, 163 Tanglin Road, Singapore, its clean and modern... serving authentic Thai dishes, The food tastes great and they are made from quality ingredients, I enjoyed all the food that we tried they were outstanding such as grilled prawn cakes on lemongrass sticks served with sweet chilli dip , authentic spicy hot and sour soup with prawns favoured with Thai herbs, mushrooms and slices of young coconut meat , pan seared lemongrass-marinated rack of lamb they were all outstanding .You could say that itâ€™s one of the Best Thai Food in Singapore The pricing is definitely higher than average but I guess you are paying for the quality of the dishes served here. The true highlight of the night was definitely the food, it was absolute perfect. Big plus also go to the Staff, very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Thai cuisine. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon

It's a little tough to find vegetarian Thai options in Singapore, never mind extensive ones like in Patara Thai. They have an entire vegetarian menu, which is mostly vegetable, not mock meat based, which is fantastic.We had the a la carte buffet, a fun concept again. The food comes to you instead of you having to go to the food. Some of the stuff I sampled: Coconut Mushroom Soup, Veggie Spring Rolls, Crusted Bean Curd with Tamarind Shallot sauce, Mango Salad, Pineapple Mock Chicken Rice, Mushroom Tofu Basil, Mango Sticky Rice. The flavours were spot on and the food was very satisfying. The service was friendly but rather slow. If that can be improved, it'll be perfect
4
We went with a group of 8 to have dinner here. We asked the waitress to recommend us a selection of starters and main courses. Her selection was excellent, the food was great. Lovely atmosphere and excellent service.
4
Had an enjoyable meal here with family members, plenty of choices and also good for vegetarians. Also accommodated for our 6 month old baby.
5
this place rocks. we were 6 persons eating out there for a nice dinner. the quality of the food is amazing and the service was wonderful; thank you very much miss Kim Mary Raymond and you team for a super evening
5
My wife and I are visiting Singapore from London and tonight we stumbled across Patara and ate there. Our meal was by far the best we have had since we arrived over a week ago. The Thai food was authentic and quite superb! Kim and her team looked after us well throughout the meal and made the dining experience a memorable one. We will come back
3
The food was ok. Not the best Thai we have had but certainly acceptable. The service was poor mainly due to there being too many people in the restaurant for the staff to cope with. We walked into the restaurant and were not acknowledged even though the waiter came over to sit two other diners. (Although am beginning to think that's not unusual here...) We were then left for 15 minutes with the menus and not even offered a drink. After we pointed this out the service did improve but it was obvious that from about 8 till 9 there were not enough staff. Ambience was ok. Wouldn't rush back
4
Had their executive set lunches with the wife the other day. Good variety and great food. Prawn green curry was good as were the soups and the sticky rice with mango dessert. My only gripe is with the chicken in the soup, which was a bit chewy, and not as tender as you would expect. Also, we had to ask for the set lunch menu; we were only handed the regular dinner menus.Service was good too. Highly recommended
3
My party of 7 had dinner tonight & the service level & responsiveness was satisfactory. Food & dessert selection was adequate, in particular the fish with lime sauce & morning glory vegetable were well prepared. If there is an area for improvement, I would say the service staff should try to find time to thank the guests when they leave to reinforce service experience
4
We had few dishes. But what i really like was the morning glory veggie. It was really good. Unfortunately, the tomyum does not taste as good as those in Thailand. We had the deep fried fish, also really good. They are under staff so if the restaurant is full, then might take sometimes for you to get your food. On overall would recommend the restaurant
5
We found this restaurants while searching for restaurants near the Singapore botanical gardens. The restaurant is located on the third floor of a mall near orchard road. The food here is fantastic, as is the service. What was especially good is the copious amount of pure vegetarian items. The restaurant has a separate vegetarian menu. Every item on that menu is pure vegetarian (no fish sauce, oyster sauce, shrimp paste, etc.) We confirmed this directly with the wait staff.One comment - we tried the red curry. It certainly was good. But it was not as spicy as we had expected. However, the other items were all fantastic. On the whole, an excellent place.
2
We visited for dinner; half the dishes we ordered were bad. The chicken cooked in pandan leaf was hard and dry instead of how it should be, soft and moist. The whole fish was also dry and looked a bit like what you'd get at KFC if they were selling fish. At the price we paid, we expected better. It is strange that the food was so mediocre because in previous times it was better. We went on a Tuesday night, and I can only assume that maybe their regular chef was not there and a pretty bad chef was cooking that night. We won't be going there again in a hurry
5
Excellent Thai meal, a really nice restaurant on the third floor of the Tanglin Mall.
Food is very good authentic Thai with great flavours. Staff were helpful and friendly and had time to talk, which makes for a good evening. Highly recommend!
3
The food is good. What made this not a high-end restaurant as it aims to be are (a) very dated décor, more comfortable than smart; and (b) courteous but quite blurred service staff.
5
From start to finish excellent evening. Super food with good advise on choices from staff. Staff very good and pleasant. Good wine list. Comfortable relaxed dining area Located in a shopping mall so caught taxi there and found on 3 rd floor.
5
Was there for lunch. The menu is complete. The portions are adequate and the food is very authentically Thai.
The ambiance and service are very good. It is reasonanly priced but not cheap.
3
The Thai food served is authentic and tasty. The place is a bit hidden and known mostly to regulars only.
5
We had a wonderful evening at Patara's. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very comfortable and relaxing. Food is excellent and the waiters are very helpful in selecting the right dishes. Service is prompt and friendly. A wide selection of good wines is available. Patara's is not a cheap restaurant but the food is worth every dollar

5
We went here on our last night in Singapore and very glad we did. It's a hidden restaurant inside Tanglin Mall but the food was great and the service was excellent! The portions were all good for sharing, well seasoned food, and nicely presented. Would definitely recommend this place. Also, staff were very kind, friendly and most of all, attentive. Kudos
2
Had seen the restaurant in Tanglin Mall and given it limited interest from the outside. But read glowing reports with it ranked top 20 out of 9000 restaurants (at least at the time), so gave it a go. Quiet weekday evening with only 4 tables in use. Limited atmosphere and decoration but nothing bad: was quiet. Food was acceptable and well presented: but the vegetable soup was so peppery couldn't drink the soup part. And one of our main food dishes was forgotten: we asked but by that stage we cancelled it. Service was polite but non-existent: we had to wave several times to attract attention which given there were only 4 tables and either 3 or 4 staff was unusual. For dessert and coffee, I had to get up and go and investigate the bar area to find someone: server was reading messages on phone: and then brought 1 dessert menu and no coffee/drinks menu for 4 of us to share. Was relatively expensive for what we receivedWe had a pleasant evening, but food was nothing special and service was polite but not present. Suggest you go to Jim Thompson Thai restaurant, which is 500m awa
3
On a friend's recommendation, we decided to go here instead of our usual THAI restaurant whenever we ware in Singapore. Wrong decision. Amongst other orders, we had the steamed sea bass. The fish was not fresh which is important when it's steamed. Even the clear tom yum soup was not up to par. I have had better at hawker centres for a third of the price. The only redeeming part of this experience is the overall attitude of the staff. Will we be back? It's a resounding No
4
Went with the family. Was already amazed by the service and food demonstration from the menu before the food arrived. Enjoyed it so much!
4
The resturant ambience is great for a cozy lunch or dinner. The food feels healthy and tasty. Dainty servings thus it is good for first dates.
4
Came with my colleagues for lunch and enjoyed the lunch sets that came Woh an appetizer, main and dessert. One of the few places in Singapore that serves this level of authentic Thai cuisine.
4
Good food, great service at Patara. All shld try if you are about authentic Thai food. Good value for their lunch set on weekdays.
4
We had the yellow curry lobster which was tasty and fresh!
The pineapple rice and pad Thai were great as well!
5
Authentic Thai food. Love the tom yam soup and yellow curry lobster. Great service too. Will come back again.
5
Delicious!! The food was fantastic and authentic and the lovely staff were kind and very accommodating of my need for less spice. Must try!
4
Attended Patara Fine Thai restaurant today. Food was exquisitely done and delicious. The staff were friendly and helpful.
5
One of the best places to have thai fine cuisine; we ordered the seabass , beef, and lamb curry and they were prepared well. The bass was extremely well cooked , the beef was tender, and curry was excellent. The service staff were also very friendly and the place felt very cosy. Would thoroughly recommend this place to those who haven't tried thai food and are looking for a place to do so. The price is extremely reasonable considering that it is fine dining
5
Quiet solo dinner excellent. The staff is so welcoming and the food is great. Authentic and tuned to western spice taste upon request. Very accommodating. Relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable. Hostess and server, Kim is gracious and so helpful! Many happy returns, I hope! Thanks so much
5
The food was generally good especially the salad and starter so is the green curry. We enjoyed the olive rice too. Great!
5
Quality Thai food, attentive staff who will give good recommendations for the food.
Lobsters, steamed whole seabass, pork belly with coconut sauce is good. A nice meal for couples or families.
5
A great place to enjoy fine dining thai food. We are happy with the food, it meets our expectation. Amazing food.
5
Food and ambience here is excellent! The food tastes so good that we visited this restaurant in London as well as in Singapore multiple times. I
5
Love the lime seabass and Tom yum goong here! They serve brown unpolished rice instead of just the usual red which we prefer. Desserts also nicely refined. Would go again
5
Good service and the food is tasty. The environment is good and clean. Good place to chat with friends.
5
Food is Superb! Excellent customer service! Highly recommended!😊
We love the tom yum soup, fried morning glory, seabass!
5
The smell of lemongrass reminded us of Thailand as we entered the restaurant. We were greeted then with a warm smile by the staffs. We asked for some suggestions and we end up having the Patara Premium to start which is an assortment of their signature appetizer. Followed then by a well-balanced, flavourful soup, Tom kha gai, the chicken in galangal and coconut cream soup. For our main course we had the Green beef shin curry, morning glory in shrimp paste and steamed seabass in lime and chili which was our favorite. Lastly for dessert we had the mango sticky rice and thai mo mo jaja - excellent food and service!
4
We chose to dine at the end of town near Tanglin Road, and found Patara on TripAdvisor. We'd endorse most earlier reviews. Food really good and a genuine step up from an "average" Thai restaurant.Exceptional tom yum!We found the service very good, but we were there early and before things got busy. I think service was still effective later, going on the apparent content of fellow diners.Not a "romantic" address but the inside of the restaurant is really well done and creates an enjoyable atmosphere.Definitely recommend this place
5
Have patronised this restaurant several times, for family dinners/lunches and other occasions.The weekend lunch buffets will be a separate review - this is specifically for the ala carte menu for dinner.The starting soft shell crab and raw mango salad was good, as was the Tom Yum Goong.We follow that with the Australian Beef with Tamarind Sauce (not in photos), Seafood Pineapple Fried Rice, and the Duck in Red Curry. There was also a staple Coconut Rice, which was delightfully steamed in a real coconut.All were good, with the minor exception of the Pineapple Fried Rice, which was slightly flat.This was followed with a Red Ruby dessert, which was good too..
5
Love the food and ambience here. Dishes are flavourful and plated very exquisitely.
Enjoyed my time here with friends. Will be back.
5
Food is good and service is excellent. Fully recommended. Pork ribs must try very good and spring chicken is also good.
4
Good variety of Thai food, great ambience! Perfect for a family dinner. Wait staff are patient, friendly and helpful.
5
Patara serves authentic Thai cuisine. We enjoy a wonderful dinner always at Patara. Love the prawn curry.
5
I went here with my family to have a birthday lunch and the food were delicious and the staff are also very nice and friendly. It's was a great experience for us. The beef green curry and pad Thai here is a must order.
5
Delicious Thai food and helpful staff! The panaeng curry is excellent and the chilli chocolate cake and banana fritters with coconut ice cream for dessert stood out! We really had a great lunch as the atmosphere was great as well!
5
The food is great. A little inconvenient accessing from MRT but it's definitely worth the walk!!! The curry was very smooth and the ribs were just right.
5
Excellent Thai food! Love the new menu especially salad and dessert. Also like the ambience here which is probably one of the best Thai restaurant in Singapore.
5
This place hasn't fail me so far. Excellent food, nice ambience, good service and reasonably price.
Will be back of course!
5
Had a fantastic time here. The staff is helpful. The food is good. I would recommend friends and family here.
5
my family loves patara so much that we really miss the food so much. the service is very friendly and my family is so satisfied. i will bring my friends who loves really delicious Thai food.
5
Excellent service ! Nice ambience and great set of service crew. Food was awesome and delicious. Totally enjoyed my time here .
5
Took the manager recommendation to order the promo lobster! The lobster turns out great! It was fresh and delicious! Water was replenished timely. Good team good service.
4
Great ambience and atmosphere with plush seats and decorations. Food is good and the service is great. Servers were attentive and friendly and gave great recommendations.
5
Ate lunch here with my mom. Had a great lunch with some yummy Thai food. The slow braised pork was really good. I highly recommend it!
5
The waitress and waiters were all very attentive and friendly. While we were having a hard time deciding what to order, they waited patiently. We were are very impressed with the food! Definitely coming back again!
5
Was here for a catch up session with my friends. Was very happy with the food and level of service & attentiveness Mary and the manager on duty (Christian) catered. They were very friendly and willing to talk and interact with the customers. Would come back here again
5
Went to Patara Thai on a recent trip to Singapore. Would recommend this restaurant for either lunch or dinner. For dinner you might need a reservation. Excellent food and excellent service. We had a variety of food and it was all very tasty. We had a duck wrap with leek, corn and prune sauce, green chicken curry and kankong in blachan - all very good
5
The restaurant has a classy and welcoming ambience, and the waitress was very helpful and knowledgable about the restaurant's signature dishes. Highlights of the meal were the fresh lobster with black pepper sauce, green curry vegetables, and mango salad with deep-fried soft shell crab, where the tartness of the mango perfectly offset the crab's flavour. We enjoyed additional discounts on top of the usual Eatigo promotion, with the only downside being the limited amount of time to savour the food. Will definitely be returning to try more
2
I've been to Patara frequently over many years but hadn't visited for maybe 12 months so decided to head along for a family night out.In doing a review I try to be fair and balanced. Let me start off by saying that the food here is usually of a high standard. However there are a few issues.First one is their policy of not serving tap water. You'll be greeted at your table with a prominent bottle of Evian. This isn't complimentary and if you ask for simple tap water you'll get a refusal. This is the only place I've ever been to in Singapore that does this and frankly it's gouging. Lets face it Evian is pretty bad mineral water anyway. The waitress seemed fairly embarrassed as we wondered how they manage to wash the dishes.Do they use Evian? Regardless this sticking point alone puts your back up. Then lets talk about the drinks. You get a glass of whatever you order. This almost certainly disguises the fact you are getting short changed there too. Finally the cost. This is serious ten of the belt costs. I have no issues with premium restaurants charging premium prices but honestly $42 for a fish??? Nonsense. Then add on issues with not having certain soft drinks (there is a large supermarket downstairs so that problem could be fixed easily) so you get forced into pricey alternates.Staff I have to say are good and making do with what I suspect they know are policies designed to annoy customers.So despite a decent meal I'd say because of no water policy allied with price gouging that I'll not be back. If you are going make sure you like Evian if you want water and be prepared to pay top dollar
4
Excellent food, good ambience and great service! The vegetable green curry was fantastic. The satay prawn and chicken were also to die for. Will certainly come back again.
5
We tried the green curry, pineapple rice, satay and I personally had a Thai iced tea and it was all very good! Not too heavy on the stomach but still full of flavour
5
coconut soup is nice as well as satay with peanut. (vegetarian style) I like the ambience as well as the service.The food is nicely decorated too.
5
It was a little hard to find but helpful shop owners told us where to go. We were seated at a quiet corner and we were able to carry on a business dinner. Good service and good food.
4
This restaurant is a bit out of the way, upstairs in a small mall, but well worth looking for. Nicely decorated, with excellent service. We had the Vegetarian soup, Sauteed Broccoli and Mushrooms and the Red Curry. It was all excellent. Great find!
4
We went for a family dinner a few nights ago. Wanted to see how it holds up against Patara in London. The food was great. Service could do with improvement and be made a bit faster.
4
Great food. The service is friendly and the food is honestly quite good. Liked the curry and beef. Cooked well.
3
Was here to celebrate a friend's birthday dinner. We ordered the special boston lobster cook style as recommended by the waitress, with tom yam soup and Thai fish cake. The waitress was quite eager to please and keep asking for feedback whenever we sample the served dish. The lobster was overdone and the sauce was kinda strange tasting. You never thought a fine restaurant will fail with the most basic tom yam soup but they did, again with un fresh fish slices and they replace it with another bowl with seafood instead of fish. Only the fish cake was good. Ambience was nice, though a little dark for my liking. I will not be back for sure.
5
Was here with my girlfriend for weekday dinner, was not crowned. Service was fast, food served promptly, waitress was attentive to our needs. We love the Yum Som-O pomelo salad. The Grouper was very fresh and crispy, goes well with the sweet and spicy sauce. The dessert platter was delicious too! A great experience overall.
5
The restaurant ambience is nice and cosy. The food is delicious and it is an abundance of different Flavours. We have been to Thailand countless number of times but No need to go to Thailand to try one of the best Thai food restaurant. It is just amazing. Highly recommended. Try the starter mixed platter, the tom yum soup or coconut milk soup and all the currys are simply delicious
5
Loved the ambience of the restaurant. Excellent food and service. The manager as well as the servers were very accommodating!
5
Fantastic food and great service, nice environment. We are delighted by the service member and the warm smiles. And of course the authentic Thai food.
4
Love the fresh Boston lobster sautéed in wild ginger and fresh peppercorn sauce!
Nice ambience and good services!
Will definitely recommend to my friends and family :)
4
Lovely restaurant will amazing service. The tom yam gung (prawn) packs a punch though the portion is quite small for $12. We thoroughly enjoyed the grilled beef, chicken and basil and the eggplant. I especially love the pomelo salad. Will definitely return again.
5
Christian service is fabulous and he takes extra effort to recommend the dishes to our liking! He is the reason why we are here.
5
Worthy to mention are the Pomelo salad, Tom Yum Goong Soup and Red Curry. Staff are friendly and professional.
4
It was a good experience with good food and amazing service. Highly recommended for a nice meal with relaxing ambiance. Great for family meals or just for 2.
4
One of the finest Thai cuisine in Singapore. Good presentation. The location is bit off the main shopping district.
4
We stumbled across Patara Thai on the top floor of Tanglin Mall. Service is strong, and the kitchen offers a good selection of plant based choices. The space is well maintained and the team has created a genuinely welcoming vibe. A nice spot for a quiet Friday dinner
5
My father in law is so excited to come here to celebrate father's day. The beautiful soothing ambience really made him feel at home the moment he stepped in. The warm friendly staff were so nice to recommend us a wonderful dinner. My father in law was extremely overjoyed!
5
Food was really good
Dessert was amazing
Ambience was magical
Service staff were welcoming, professional and polite.
Bravo!
5
Highly recommended. Mango and Papaya salad were great. The overall food quality was very good.
Service by the staff were attentive and professional.
5
Delicious lunch out with the family. Great service from the staff who were attentive and friendly : )
5
Great food ..enjoyed the real flavour of Thai food. Prefect ambiance. Nice variety of dishes in a Tanglin mall.
4
Wide selection in the menu . Good ambience for business discussion with corporate customer . Friendly and helpful staff .
5
Fantastic ambience (family-friendly and spacious). Good vegetarian selection - must order is the veg green curry. The service is a refreshing change from what is typically received in singapore.
5
We made our first visit to Patara in June and were greatly impressed. First by the staffs' friendly and patient nature, and second by the wide selection of food available on the menu. The meal was served promptly and the food quality was excellent. Special mention goes out to the "Gai yang khamin", or spring chicken and Thai herbs. Highly recommended
5
We've been to Patara with friends over the last 20 years - and over that time has always had a wonderfully wide range of Thai - and at the finer end. Dinner tonight was with family, and the service did not disappoint, and the food is as good as ever My favourites tonight was from the vegetarian menu - I'd recommend the vegetarian dumplings.
5
It was our 3rd times dining in Patara Fine Dining at Tanglin Mall. We can certainly vouch that it's the best Thai food in town by far. No doubt on that! Food and service are excellent. It can't be more authentic than this, really! Every single dishes we ordered were absolutely delicious. (We ordered the fresh and tangy Pomelo Salad with Soft Shell Crab, Grilled Australian Steak - which the meat were so tender and succulent, the rich flavour of Green Chicken Curry, Delicious Seafood Pad Thai and Pineapple Fried Rice). We feasted on the dishes in joy and finished our plates clean. Kudos to the Chefs!! The service is also faultless. All the waitstaffs are great! And Kim, the assistant restaurant manager is excellent! She's really attentive, resourceful, and friendly. We felt very welcomed and were equally well taken care eventhough the last reservation we made was through "eatigo". It's truly a downright heart-warming experience. We will definitely return, recommend and give 5 stars rating from food all the way to the overall service!Keep up the good work, Patara!
5
I was very pleasantly surprised with Patara during my first visit to the restaurant. As my out of town guest wanted an early dinner, we arrived a little past 6pm during mid-week. The staff was very attentive in part due to limited clients. We ordered appetizers, salads and Tom Yum soup. All were excellent especially the tacos, soup and I especially enjoyed the fish cake as they were not oily and came puffy unlike many other restaurants serving shrivelled fish cakes. The Pomelo salad was fresh and not salty which suited my tastes. We ordered many dishes to share for mains. Highlights included beef tenderloin, stuffed chicken wings and steam seabass; which reminded me of my days posted in Bangkok. The only down side was our disappointment with mango sticky rice dessert as mangoes were not sweet even though this is mango season in Thailand. I recommend the restaurant for both business and personal.
4
We have been visiting this fine Thai restaurant periodically for many years. There is no wow factor to be honest but their service and food are consistently well above the average. Never have a disappointing moment.
5
Had lunch with friends. First time here. Great food. Great ambience.
Inside tanglin mall. So parking is easy.
4
Attentive service with quality food.....Recommended! Simply love the ambience. Please go for the mango sticky rice deserts. Two thumbs up! Sign up for the privilege card too............You won't be disappointed!
5
Great service, wonderfully balanced and delicate flavours! Good vegetarian selection. Enjoyed the Pad Thai and Mango Salad in particular. Would definitely recommend for a nice quiet evening dinner.
5
Good value and quality modern Thai food, nice environment, good and friendly service. We have visited Patara twice and will visit again to try different dishes. We appreciate the Vegetarian option and enjoyed our meals on both visits.
5
Great ambience, great food and great company. Patara ticks all the boxes! Enjoyed the fried fish in particular!
5
Nice ambience with fantastic food. Try their signature green curry, pomelo salad and fresh boston lobster. Will definitely be back!
5
Best Value for money in town for Modern Thai restaurant, given the sophistication of the food (Modern Thai authentic cuisine), the quality (top notch) of the ingredients, the elegance of the service and artistic plating, the charming kindness and cheerfulness of the staff, their absolute professionalism, the clear, vast and spotless clean premises, with a modern Thai ambiance, and the divine, soft and fresh lemongrass fragrance.Every dish is refined, light and colourful. The flavours are plentiful, enhanced by the spices, but not overwhelmingly. Prawn cake is a must and crab dumpling too. Ingredients used must be of excellent quality, as they keep a fantastic texture.Everything has to be tested really. Many vegeterian dishes available.Set lunches $25-30 and excellent tasting menu-like lunch and dinner at $88.Buffet a la carte on weekends at $48.Chef and kitchen staff are mainly Thai: guarantee of authenticity.Great for families in weekends, and business lunches or small gatherings 2-3 pole. There are 3 private dining rooms.A great discovery. Highly recommendable
5
We visited Patara twice this week and everyone throughly enjoyed all of our meals. On our first visit, I can say my favourite for the appetiser would have been the Patara Premium platter, where in you get to try their signature starters. On our second visit, we tried their Lobster Special Dinner Set with 4 incredible courses. The tom kha lobster and Stir-fried lobster with fresh and peppercorn, garlic was outstanding! You must try this! Definitely worth it especially if paired with wine. And lastly, the service was consistent and very attentive. We were in awe on how all of the staff treated us so special

Ate here recently with coworkers and the appetizers and food were very good. It is conveniently located in the Tanglin Mall. The service was fine. Enjoyed the food much better than the food at Jim Thompson which is a highly rated Thai restaurant in Singapore. It was better food and a better value
5
Christian and Mark are very attentive and professional. The ambience is good. The food is good and nicely presented.
5
Had dinner at the place as a group with a young child. The staff were attentive and helpful.
Food was exceptionally fragrant. Loved the duck red curry and spring chicken.
The place is dimly lit, great for a night out. Enjoyed the experience overall!
5
i was really impressed with this stunning restaurant that serves up the best thai cuisine in singapore! the presentation of the food was too beautiful that my children couldn't bear to eat it. i plan to bring my brother here for his upcoming birthday.
5
We just simply love this beautiful restaurant. There isn't much Thai restaurants in Singapore that has such a lovely ambience. The staff were very helpful and really impressed us. My father particularly loved the signature dishes. Fantastic and unforgettable experience!
5
My family and i absolutely adore this restaurant. it was really a joy having dinner with your loved ones here.
5
Came here for mum's birthday dinner. Excellent food and very nice ambience. We ordered 4 starters, the flower-shaped starter (caramelised chicken), phad thai, olive fried rice, pork belly, and the NZ lamb curry were all fabulous!Very friendly staff as well. Very attentive and yet not intrusive. Would definitely come here again for any birthday celebrations or with friends/clients
5
I brought my family here for dinner. The Ambience was so cosy and beautiful. We felt really relaxed and comfortable while the friendly service crew served us. The food is very delicious and I will definitely recommend to others who are interested to eat Thai food
5
I have always enjoyed coming to Patara Fine Thai. Here, ambience is cosy and sophisticated. Food is refined and delicious, as always. This post is to document my repeated satisfaction with this restaurant. I hope it continues to maintain the standards that it has upheld since its days at Raffles City
4
My first visit here. I won't be dying to come back.The Good:1. The ambiance is really cozy and inviting, like a fine dining place ought to be. 2. The menu had some off-the-beaten-track (authentic) dishes that you don't see in other Thai places in Singapore.3. Service is really fine... the staff is mature and cultured, not like the part-time Poly students and other inexperienced staff you find in so many places in Singapore.4. The price is slightly high, given that it's fine dining, but it's not crazy high like some of the other fine-dining places.5. The food was delicious, and they can tone down the level of spice for you if you so desire.The Not-so-good:1. I found the taste of the food rather mellow, not spice wise, but in terms of strength of other flavors, especially in the curry. For that reason alone, I didn't find the food exceptional.2. The location of Tanglin Mall and the restaurant within the mall, are rather out of the way... it's not central Orchard, or any other commonly accessed mall. So it will be a while before I come back here since there are so many equally great dining options all over the city

Patara has been an old favorite of mine for a long while now. Not sure why I've never posted a review before this! Since having moved to Geneva a year and a half ago, I generally relish all my trips home to Singapore to get my fill of local and Asian delicacies... as much as I can, I avoid missing Patara! While some have said it's decidedly guided towards a less Thai-based palette, the tastes and aromas are still very much reminiscent of good Thai hearty-ness, just a little less spicy - this would suit peeps like me... the ones who can't take too much spice. I do however appreciate all the flavors in the dishes they serve. Delicious and tasty fresh food that makes me smile. Only thing is, they do tend to be a little on the salty side. Let the service staff know if you prefer less spicy. The staff are all very friendly and hospitable and I believe they would be accommodating to your requests to spare yourself from a sharp case of hypertension. The restaurant also serves a reasonably fairly priced set menu (in as far as fine dining is considered of course) for smaller parties, for whom sharing plates might prove to be too much to handle. If you are looking for a fine dining, good service, lovely atmosphere type Thai restaurant, by all means, Patara is pretty good for that. For your $, you get fresh produce, good tastes and hospitable service reminiscent of Thai Hospitality.I would come again in any heartbeat!
5
The food was great and the staff were all very friendly and helpful with food recommendations! Definitely one of the best outlets in Singapore for a Thai food up to date!
5
Very authentic thai food. Nice ambience and excellent service. Mary, Christian, Eric made us feel welcome. Our favourite restaurant for gathetings.
5
The food is so exquisite & indeed fine dining. The restaurant staff is knowledgeable & makes one feel invited, great staff, great food 👍
4
Had been at Patara with friends. Had gone with a high recommendation on the quality of food and dis not feel let down.The restaurant has a nice setting and as a group of 6 we got a nice separate room. The food served was consistently great through starters and main course. The service levels were passable, efficient but not engaging. The wine selection was not great.Definitely worth a repeat
5
The best Thai restaurant in district 9 and 10. The cooking is fine and well served. Dishes are generous and really up to fine dining. This was my second time here after a business dinner here in feb 2017. Strongly recommend who love fine dining and Thai food to come here. Cosy ambiance and tables are big...hard to find such restaurants nowadays..dining tables are far apart to accomodate romantic or business discussion. Service is excellent too. Pricing are reasonable for a fine dining venue. Menu are easy to read and understand. Will come back with parents and family next time. Lighting is nice too.
5
Great authentic Thai food, nice ambience. Corn fritters are a must order as is the durian cake. Loved Mango salad. The fact that they had a vegetarian menu was wonderful and considerate with a lot of options. Highly recommend it for lunch or dinner in a nice cosy environment.
2
We had been for lunch once and it was "OK" so we thought we'd try delivery. Bad idea. We got the bottom of the pots on all our curries and the flavours were lacking. Meat was fatty, rice a bit old. Prices were exorbitant. We complained and they refused refund. Sad
4
This place seems to be very quiet during weekdays. Was there with a few colleagues for a work dinner. The (almost) empty place made it very conducive for our group and highlighted the staff's (already excellent) level of services. Dishes were a little small in portions but generally delicious. We ordered widely and so there were enough food to go around. In general a good place to kick back and relax over a Thai meal. Ample space between tables also provides some semblance of privacy
4
Dinner on Saturday night. Food very good. Seared scallops starter, entrees of black pepper steak, deep fried sea bass (excellent in both taste and presentation), and pork belly curry. Stir fried broccoli as veggie, and durian cakes for dessert. Bottle of Sauvignon Blanc - wine prices very reasonable.Service was so-so at best. Uneven. Didn't have our reservation in book even though we had email confirmation.Worth a visit.
3
Really not sure why this is ranked as high as it is. Ordered Tom Yum Goong, Red Curry and Kankung with chili and garlic. The soup used Tom Yum paste, so disappointed, but taste was ok. The morning glory was quite good, though a bit watery. The curry was extremely mild, didn't have enough fish sauce, and for some reason had cherry tomatoes in it. Inexplicable.Didn't have the heart to try the dessert. Overall experience: OK, just about. None of the items were actually poor, just not authentic or multi layered enough to be memorable
5
Food is authentic as close as it gets to the best....and the excellent service from the awesome staff ... especially KIM the hostess ensures I have the best dinning experience
4
👍👍👍👍
Good food and service
This is the Thai restaurant we will go in Singapore.
They serve delicious Tom yam soup and the portion is reasonable.
Other dishes are equally fantastic and worth to consider to try
4
Food was very good, as usual.
Pandan chicken from the starters is really good.
Mango sticky rice and tapioca desserts are also great.
Service excellent as always.
4
Excellent meal and service was good. The beef green curry and dessert player were good. Would recommend it.
4
Visited this restaurant with the family and was satisfied.
Reasons to visit :
1. The Lobster was tender
2. Ambience is good
3. Service is great !
4
Highly recommended. Ambience was great and staff are very friendly and courteous. We had a great time at Patara.
5
Been dining here since their Raffles City outlet and the quality hasn't deteriorated at all throughout the year. Their take on Thai food is definitely authentic and taste different from the ones you have at other Singaporean Thai restaurants. Though be prepared to spend here; their prices are high
4
Dined at Patara for a birthday dinner. Atmosphere and service were excellent. Servers were very attentive. Our dishes were served in courses. For an appetizer, we had the Papaya Salad, which was very good. Before the main course, we ordered Chicken Satay. The menu is incorrect regarding the preparation of the Satay. The menu states that the Satay is "char grilled." However, the Satay is "grilled" only, there is no "char." Unfortunately, the Satay was undercooked. We understand that Singaporeans like their chicken barely cooked but pink chicken not so nice! We highly recommend the Australian Sirloin Beef Panang Curry dish, it was very aromatic and excellent. For dessert, we had the traditional mango sticky rice. The rice was green, which means it most likely has pandan. Desert was superb. The prices are your typical Singaporean fine dining prices but the quality is much better than your typical Thai fare
4
This is My First Visit, Surprisingly I have Tasted Something Different out of my expectation, I have Ordered The Boston Lobster prepared in Black PepperSauce, Excellent Flavour Sauce while still can the taste freshness of lobster. I have ordered a glass of house white wine that go well with the Lobster. I have also ordered the Australian Beef that my son love it so much. The Restaurant Ambience is Good with Excellent of Services, The Waitress is Polite and Well Knowledge of Food Recommendation. I will definitely visit this Restaurant Again in near future and also strongly recommends this Restaurant to My others Family members and Friend
5
I love dining at Patara with my family ❤️ The food and service are excellent.I specially love the service provided by Kim. It's always so warm and welcoming I am a vegetarian so I get to enjoy Thai food vegetarian style while my family can still enjoy their regular choices
5
Great presentation for every dish served! I really like the Thai fish cakes! Yummy! The ambience of the restaurant is really cosy and the service is excellent!
4
Excellent food and attentive service! The fish cake was very tasteful. Good ambience. Will come again.
5
Amazing ambience, very friendly staffs and great food! Tried the Fresh Boston Lobster with egg noodle and Black pepper sauce and it was 💯
5
We had a very good experience at this restaurant. Ambience was excellent, wait staff were attentive without being intrusive, and the food was amongst the best Thai cuisine I've had inSingapore. Authentic and flavourful without being too oily or spicy.
5
Amazing Thai food! Visiting from Australia, hands down the best Thai food I've had the pleasure of eating. Beef shin was melt in your mouth delicious, desserts were sensational and the service was fantastic.
5
Had a great lunch complete with dessert at this place..
Great authentic thai food.. i would highly recommend to get the grilled beef and green curry chicken..
5
Great food and great service.
Food tastes like authentic thai food, would definitely come back here.. Highly recommend to order the grilled beef and green curry chicken.
5
Highly recommended! Do visit if you happen to be around the Orchard/Tanglin area. Their Tom Yam goong is a must try, as are the desserts.
5
First time with this restaurant. The Lobster with black pepper, grilled chicken and dessert are excellent with original Thai favour. The staff also provides good service. I'd recommend to reserve the table and start early for a dinner.
5
Can't help but love this beautiful restaurant - it's worth going for the decor and ambience but then the food is even better!!
4
Had a wonderful meal with girl pal. The food is unabashedly spicy - just the way we like. Had the mixed starter, lobster noodle and green curry with brown rice. Beautifully plated. Loved the blue dumplings!
5
The food, service, and presentation were outstanding. The restaurant is hidden in the upper levels of Tanglin Mall, but it is worth the search
5
We had a good dinner last night at Patara located at tanglin mall. The food was very good. With an excellent service from the staff they are very attentive and friendly. I really recommend this thai restaurant. One of the best in singapore.
5
Stopped by on Thursday night, had the red curry. Patara is one of the best thai restaurant
in singapore plus provided great service from staff who's all very accommodating. we will be back very soon to try other dishes.
5
Had an enjoyable dinner with girl friends. They are consistent with quality of the food. The service staff was attentive and very helpful. We had the lobster which was succulent and well presented
5
I was nicely surprised with Patara at tanglin mall, singapore. Portions were good size for five of us and a kid. Boston lobster is great deal with a $30 discount . Very delicious with black pepper sauce . Spring chicken is good as well . Best of all is the NZ stew lamb with Thai spices, it's so tender! All of us enjoyed the food n waiting dessert now...;
5
Patara fine thai cuisine is a great place to visit if you guys are looking for authentic thai foods,ambience is also perfect for good business deals and for family affairs because of their private rooms..staff are all very pleasant with a smile in their faces everytime I ask for something helpful and good quality of extra mile service..i will definitely visit again when I get back to SG
3
Located inside the tanglin mall this restaurant has friendly helpful staff and good food. The menu is predominantly Thai, although there are a few exceptions, all Asian cuisine. It is quit expensive for what you get and some of the food combinations are not well matched. I had lamb for my main which came with sweet rice, the two did not go together well. The starters we had were good and the deserts were OK. Overall nice if you fancy Thai but not as high end as the price would suggest
5
I went in Patara Fine Thai with my friend. There is a wide range of selection of Thai food. But don't worry they have very good staff that will explained all the food they've got they even informed us if the food is too spicy. We tried there set lunch menu and opted the 25 set lunch with food we have it's a a good value for money, thinking it is a fine casual restaurant. ..Will definitely come back...Kudos to all Service Staff and Chefs..
4
Patara has been in Singapore for as long as I've been here (16+ years!)... and it consistently delivers a very good experience. Whilst the restaurant is looking just a bit dated now, the service and quality of the food remains exemplary.The only other thing worth mentioning is that the portions are a bit on the smaller side... so the value for money isn't great otherwise I'd have given them 5 stars
4
Impressed with attentive wait staff. Impressed with the cooking and the high quality ingredients used.
4
Very impressed by the food (both taste & presentation), and of course very hospitable and patient service staff.
Wide spread of food selection; the dessert "red ruby" is simple irresistible.
Will definitely visit again.
5
Of all the Thai food places we have tried in Singapore this is by far the best in town!
Food is excellent, dishes are nicely prepared and the staff were excellent and very attentive.
Must try!
5
Had a wonderful and authentic Thai cuisine which consisted of grilled marinated chicken with spicy southern Thai style curry sauce, tofu with chilli tamarind sauce and a lovely bowl of tomyum chicken. The taste was authentic coupled with a nice ambience. Would definitely recommend to spicy Thai food lovers!
5
Excellent food and service in this quiet restaurant tucked away in a corner of the third floor at Tanglin Mall. The dishes we tried over two separate visits were all excellent. Unlike many Thai restaurants in Singapore which tend to offer overseasoned dishes, the flavouring here was perfectly balanced and nothing was too sweet or salty. The menu offerings are also more interesting than what's usually found at other Thai restaurants. Dishes such as "Goong Sarong" (Spice-marinated golden-fried prawns wrapped in crispy filo pastry, served with pineapple and pickled cucumber salad), Nua Yanf Jim Jaew (Grilled Australian 300 days grain-fed beef tenderloin served withspicy tamarind sauce are delicious, and the Chor Muang appetiser is another stunning dish, with dumplings crafted into flower shapes coloured blue and stuffed with caramelised chicken, sweet turnip and peanut filling, and topped with coconut cream reduction.Service is professional and very pleasant and the decor is elegant and stylish. This is a gem of a place and my only hesitation about giving them a great review is that it might make the place more crowded and harder to get reservations
5
My first dinner and certainly not my last at patara was amazing , the food was the best Thai food I have had and the staff beautiful friendly people. Price was very reasonable for such nice surroundings. Do your self a favour and try this place. Or yer and they gave me a free dessert
4
Staying locally at the Jen Tanglin we fancied a meal around the corner rather than down town and were pleased with our find in the adjoining Tanglin Mall the Patara fine Thai restaurant . The welcome without a reservation was warming as was the table choice a small couples booth which made a change . We chose the set 5 course tasting menu for two which was pleasing without being amazing . The fish and meat main with stir fried asparagus was excellent if not a little spicy . The ambience was complimented by the excellent service of the staff who seemed to make time for a chat with all their customers, and deserving of a tip on top of all the Singapore addons. This worth visiting restaurant if staying nearby had for me only one area of concern which was the toilets for both sexes a walk across the retail centre which for certain age groups may be awkward and for some a no no 
5
Excellent food, outstanding service, peaceful ambience. Overall a fantastic place to have a date or family dinner at. With a wide selection of authentic Thai cuisine to select from, Patara is a place that every food lover should visit at least once. The food is great, if not better than those in Thailand. Great experience, even better selection of food, would definitely come back. 10/10 would recommend this place to all my friends and family!
5
I could say that this is a must try! They offer the best thai food in the city! All crew specially the manager "Christian" were very accomodating! They were very attentive to our needs! Ambiance is very cozy that you get to enjoy the food so much! Food and service exceeded our expectations! Will definetely go baaaaack! Go and experience it for yourself! ❤
5
We spent a fantastic dinner at this restaurant. Very friendly staff that made our dinner exceptional. The moment we walked in, we were greeted with a smile. From the flavors of each authentic dish, to the ambiance of the restaurant, and excellent service. All I can say is, it was the best we have had in the 2 times we have visited Patara, we hope to visit again soon
5
Nice ambience • nice food • nice company
A very nice restaurant u must visit when you come in Singapore . Very good services here .
4
Have a good lunch, tried their set lunch, so many choices to choose from,food is affordable, delicious and staff were very accommodating.
4
Had their set lunch specials and it was so good! Also surprised by the price, especially coming from a fine dining restaurant, their set lunches won't break the bank at all (chose the $25 one)! Will def visit again!
5
Every single dish we ordered was delicious. The flower dumplings and mango salad was so delicately flavored.. the main dish of olive fried rice was excellent.The service was also outstanding..After a long business workday it is a very enjoyable way to end your day..I will surely be back again.
5
 We were greeted by the friendly staff and promptly offered their best dishes. They even directed us with better deals of their set menus and encouraged us to avail their promotions. But on top of that, the food really did not disappoint. As I can utterly remember, they have truly captured the taste of thai cuisine and we definitely enjoyed it. What i did appreciate the most was the value they give to your own preference such as your tolerance with spices. From the complimentary appetisers down to freebie desserts (promotion for facebook likers), not to mention the soothing ambiance, it was an exquisitely refined thai experience. I would highly recommend it
5
If you are looking to experience Thailand without needing to fly to Thailand, Patara is second to none. The lemongrass scent on their lobby will greet you and their cheerful Service Staff as well. We tried their best sellers and of course with the help of the Service Staff on explaining to us the menu. We started with the Patara Premium that provides us 4 starters on one plate its like a bit of everything and Tom Yum soup. For our main course we order their Fresh Boston Lobster in panang sauce Thermidor that comes along with 2 bowls of rice. Try their mango sticky rice as well. Our whole experience has been rewarded with great quality food and incomparable service
4
Its so hard to find fine thai food in singapore that's great to bring business partners and in-laws. Food may seem to be a little pricey compared to the regular thai food we find, however if I must say some dishes justifies the price.The crabs were great, despite being drenched in curry, you can still tasted the sweetness which is pleasantly perplexing how the chef made that happen. Located in a somewhat inaccessible part of the orchard road bell, but this place as its beauty being away from the bustling part of orchard for some peace and quiet
1
For the longest time Patara restaurant has always been our choice for fine Thai food and peace and quiet in our neighbor Mall ( Tanglin Mall) . Of course last time we came was more than 6 months ago ....well ...watch out .!!!...something has changed ...the new chef SUCKS ...and so does the food ( not to mention the wine by the glass)....only thing left in place the good service and the nice ambience . If you are looking for good food .???? you are in the wrong plac
4
With Thailand working partners who were invited for dinner in Singapore, it was also complimented by them that the foods were authentic and nice. While some guests went for delicious ala carte menu, the dinner set was equally good. Also save the trouble of choosing the menu items. Nice ambience and well decorated not forgetting the good service by staff. Indeed a good dinner out with guests
4
Despite many negative reviews of their service, I personally think that they are attentive to our needs. For example, my friend ordered Thai Milk Tea but it was too much for her taste. They actually offered to change the drink to Lemon Grass after my friend asked for more milk to make it sweeter. Food is fantastic and every dish we ordered is definitely up to par. Price wise, I would say is a bit steep but given everything as a package, it is worth the price.
5
Delicious Flavours, exceptional service. The decor is beautiful and very authentic. Try this place for a wonderful dining experience.
5
From now, PATARA is offering this great value lunch time set meals for weekdays. Each menu starts from S$20 before taxes etc and offers lots of choices! Food was excellent and service attentive. Worth a visit definitely!👍🏼👏🏼
4
Nice dinner, nice food and nice place and very nice service. The lobster is amazing. Definitely will come back again.
4
Maybe this is not a destination for the lunch crowd but the food (set menu) was very suitable for a light lunch and tasted very ice indeed and good value for money
4
Fine Thai dining! Traditional Thai Cuisine that will keep you eating. Everything on the menue is culinary art! The mango sticky rice ended the meal beautifully. The green rice was a brilliant twist.
4
Had my birthday dinner here and was really impressed with the staff who went out of their way to make the dinner a great one. The food is delicious and the ambience of the place is lovely. Would highly recommend!
4
Attentive staff and great food and service. Worth visiting. Nice ambiance. Great for family and friends gathering. Fine dining restaurant.
3
Good location, nice ambiance... Appetiser ok... But the rice and massaman curry was very vey weak. A truly disappointing dish
4
The first thought of Thai food outlet in our mind is Patara.at Tanglin Mall.
We have eaten here numerous times and we find the food is reasonable with the quality offered.
Chicken in curry sauce is yummy. Pomelo salad is really good.
4
Ate hear as part of a large business group, very fresh well prepared Thai food with an extensive menu. Do not let the fact that it is in a shopping mall put you off as this is common even with good restaurants. Staff were very helpful and would certainly recommend
3
One of the OK Thai places in Singapore... Not as good as in Thailand...
Service is ok...
If you missed Thailand and not going there anytime soon, recommend that you come here.
5
Excellent food and service! Will be visit next time!!!!!!!!
Green curry is very nice and fired rice also very good!!!!!
4
Very nice environment, suitable for people who are looking for a place where you can talk with each other while enjoying a fine food. Food are all served quite quickly. Quite like the Tom Yum Soup.
5
Patara is our Favourite Thaï Restaurant in Singapore! We really enjoy tasting aromas. It seams that Patara team use Super premium ingredients in order to propose outstanding dishes. We absolutely recommend Patara.
5
We came to Patara for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh & very well presented. They were able to create a intimate & calming atmosphere inside the slightly outdated Tanglin Mall.
We will definitely be back!
4
Yummy duck curry. Went with family. Got free mango sticky rice for writing this review. You can too. Enjoy. Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy
4
The duck curry is a must have! Good vegetarian option. We had the claypot baked tofu and aubergine with chilli. Its not very hot although it says chilli. Not very good if you are those who wants to be challenged with lots of chilli! Do NOT order the pandanus chicken. It does not have the nice charred caramel flavour that we expected. We have been here several times due to the good ambience and the superb service. Definitely good to celebrate special occasion. The Amex promotion is pretty good too
5
Patara is tucked away on the second level of the Tanglin Mall, so is a bit out of the way, and a bit of a walk from Orchard Station. For lovers of Thai cuisine, it is well worth seeking out. The restaurant is attractively decorated, is quiet, and the service is quick and attentive. Try the whole fish, which is superb, and if the staff tell you the fish is large, believe them. It would be a meal in itself for two. Best of all, we have found Patara to be consistently excellent. We can't wait to go back again
4
If you are looking for fine Thai cuisine, this is a place to come to. Had the chance to go off the beaten path (slightly) by ordering the braised pork belly in coconut juice. The belly was delectable with a melts-in-the-mouth finishing. As expected, since its braised in coconut juice, the meat was very tender and sweet. Only regret was that the pork has too slim a fat layer to boost its juiciness.Also ordered the fried garoupa that came with a separate tamarind and chilli sauce. Fish is fresh and well fried. Crispiness maintained even after 20 minutes. The overall taste of the food here is strong, so it may be difficult to eat them without rice.Service was excellent here with the waiting staff very attentive to our needs. Only slight hiccup was a dish was mistakenly ordered even though we did not placed it. Thankfully, the dish was withdrawn without much fuss by the staff.As it's fine dining, it is expected that the costs will be higher (but not unreasonably high) along with the standards of service. 
4
We enjoyed our meal very much , we tried Thai before but this place is authentic n nice.We like the ambient n pleasant environment and the service staffs are very helpful n polite .We would come back again n would recommend others to come too
4
Great food! Will definitely recommend this place! The braised pork belly was really delicious Durian cake with vanilla ice-cream was heavenly!
4
Dinner last night was quite good. Husband's Curry was very good but did have rather large pieces of fat that he had to maneuver. We would go back again. Restaurant was nearly empty and service was good.
4
We had an excellent weekday set lunch ($38 per person). Generous portions. My favorite was the olive fried rice and the dessert! Will definitely come back again.
4
Really tasty authentic Thai food with an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes. Recommend the red curry and spicy aubergine
5
Relax and service is very good, desert good. We come without reservation and still have been seated though full house. We ordered not much food but still well received good and hospital service.
5
We are regulars here. We enjoy great vegetarian food. The tofu satay ,and dumplings are must haves . The ambience is truly fine dining.
5
We enjoyed our dinner so much the menu was rich with various options even my fussy eaters children found something to their liking.
The food was all delicious, very calm and warm atmosphere, friendly staff.
This is one place to return to for sure.
4
I stumbled onto Patara by chance during lunch time, Tanglin Mall Cafes were too busy and I don't like to queue for food. Patara was quiet and a perfect getaway from the maddening lunch crowd. The menu read like a list of temptations. The wine menu was okay. I enjoyed Chor Muang, a beautiful purple coloured dumpling with moist caramelised chicken, turnip and something else. In fact, it is like a light meal in itself. To test whether I like any Thai restaurant, I usually go for Pad Thai. It was delicious. The service was very polite and attentive. Definitely a place to return to for a meal with friends or family
4
Enjoyed a lovely, peaceful vegetarian meal with my spouse. We can highly recommend the green mango salad--spicy, but delicate and delicious--as well as the eggplant and basil plus the vegetarian coconut green curry with tofu and assorted vegetables that were crisp, fresh, light yet filling. Not too much, not too little, just enough. Friendly service and a pleasant ambience: recommended and will return. Nice mango sticky rice for dessert
2
Made a table reservation with specific requirement for dinner. We were ushered by the restaurant manager, Rameina, to a table that was NOT according to correct pax and NO high chair for toddler. Rameina brought out a high chair and placed it between a flat ground and a slightly elevated platform. We told her that the uneven level of the high chair that sat on was not safe for toddler and requested her to extend our table to meet the correct pax and have the high chair place in the middle of the table. She was utterly unhappy and showed us her displeasure. Food is only average. There are other restaurant in Singapore that serve better food. Will not visit again
3
Reasonable food at reasonable price. Good service. Okay environment. Nothing special about it but you will surely not be disappointed with over all experience.
4
A bit expensive in comparison with local restaurant but very good quality and service. A lot of dishes choice ! And probably all good
4
A wonderful flavoursome meal with great vegetarian choices! The green thai curry and rice and the green apple salad were delicious.
4
This is not the first time we are at Patara but the quality of Thai food, the quiet elegance of the ambience and the homely setting makes it a must while shopping at Tangling Mall! We were there with family and young kids who just love the food and the easy ambience created by the friendly Thai staff last weekend for a lazy lunch. All of us had a soup, my preference being the spicy Tom Yum, followed by vegetable with black pepper sauce and steamed rice. The food was just perfect and we had a relaxed time. Will certainly go there again. You should also try it
3
We came in a big group (9) with friends who are fans of the Patara.Certain dishes like the crispy fish and the Thai classic chicken wings are good but for the rest it can be average. Considering their prices, we can expect really good Thai cuisine... and good service.The decor is rather chic and quite westernized with the possibility of reserving a private room for your party. However the sore point is their service which is deplorable
5
Top notch Thai cuisine is what you can expect here. The setting is pretty sophisticated, in tasteful vibrant gold and dark wood, and the dishes come in elegant convoluted plates. There are lots of starters, and modern creations such as grilled jumbo prawns with lemongrass sauce, lemongrass-marinated New Zealand rack of lamb with a very spicy green papaya salad to choose from, and roast duck curry always a treat with hot fragrant rice, and off course stir-fried pad ka prao (basil leaves and minced pork) this list of what is arguably the best Thai restaurants in Singapore, The service staff seem sincerely pleasant, however if you're looking for a bargain, try their buffet lunch on weekends

We are two couples visiting Singapore after a cruiseWe were suggested Patara by the hotels concierge as we were looking for local cuisine, as another Resturaunt had last orders at 21:30 we had asked aboutUnfortunately Patara suffers from this also due to its location in a shopping centreWe have eaten at the UK Soho branch many times and enjoyed the experience, but tonight half way through our main course we were shocked to be approached and asked if we wanted to order a desert!We declined and after this and felt disappointed with our evenings experience although the food was good, we had ordered wine and spirits and felt our custom was not appreciatedAnd would suggest that this is a lunch venue only as an evening meal would need to be an early evening mea

I've been going to Patara for the past 15 years and the food is consistently good. I'm not a big fan of restaurants in malls but the decor in Patara is classy and it has big windows on one side so one doesn't feel like a mall rat while there. It's not cheap but I always feel a meal there is money well spent. Excellent Thai food and a pleasant experience overall

Very good, authentic food - the duck curry is particularly fine. Lovely ambiance, if slightly too dimly lit. Very nice place to eat, especially if you're staying at one of the hotels nearby and can't face hotel food or walking further a field to Orchard Road.
3
Very nice setting within Tanglin Mall. Very friendly and helpful staff, although they charged us a more expensive wine than we had ordered (and she knew about it because she immediately had a response ready when we discovered that). Food very good, we enjoyed it very much. BUT for sure one of the most expensive Thai restaurants we have been to in Singapore. So in conclusion although we liked it very much, the price/quality is not good as it's simply overpriced and you can find the same quality of Thai in Singapore at a lower price. Same price category as Jim Thompson I think, more or less.
3
Serves decent Thai cuisine but expensive considering its uninspiring decor and that it is also not in the best location. Not worth returning to.
3
Incredibly inconsistent restaurant - some days are great, others awful... super nice manager but some of the staff is borderline useless. Shame as both the location and cuisine would warrant a far better execution.
4
this was a fathers day lunch with family and all went well. very good selection for vegetarians (no meat, fish, sauces). Selection included salad, soup and main course. courteous service and my request with online reservation worked very well. Recommended

Singapore residents had told us that Patara was one of their favourite restaurants but, alas, it did not live up to expectations. The location, especially for dinner, is somewhat bizarre (hidden away in a shopping mall with the toilets on the other side of the central core), the decoration uninspiring and the atmosphere rather dead even on a busy evening. Whilst the food was quite good, the service was haphazard and rather frustrating - it took an eternity to be seated because our reservation seemed to have gone missing in action, the dishes also took a long time to arrive as did the drinks, and the waiters always appeared to be looking in another direction. I wouldn't return to Patara as a "destination restaurant" but would be happy to eat there at lunchtime in the (somewhat unlikely) event that I was shopping in the mall
5
If you are shopping in the In the busy area like Tanglin shopping mall and want to have a good Thai meal this is for you . Dinner is a good time . It little on the expensive side but the food is good .,please tell them how hot the in taste medium / mild the thai Green curry should be . Not good for families with kids .

I had business lunch here and we just ordered the set lunches. They are pretty good actually especially the appetizers. First came the spring rolls and then the vermicelli salad. Main we have coconut chicken soup, pork belly curry, broccoli with dried scallop and cod fillets. The coconut chicken soup is great and with very immense coconut flavour, and the vermicelli salad is also very good because the flavour all went to the vermicelli.However the pork belly curry is not tender enough and the curry taste is too strong to cover all other flavour. Broccoli with dried scallop is good but it appeared to be a Chinese dish instead of Thai.Dessert is great with glutinous rice and mango. Mango is very sweet and the coconut sauce on the glutinous rice mixed very well.Service is good. Waitresses are quite smart to refill water before we asks to, and they could let us know clearly what these dishes are. We will come here again. ;

I regularly come here in the early evening for a good Thai curry before heading to the airport. I see several poor reviews recently however I have never had either poor service or food. In fact its the best Thai restaurant I've been to in Singapore and especially like the fresh ingredients including crispy basil.

Food was ok but the service was truly terrible. Totally unacceptable when they're charging $40 for a main course.On the service side, we had a latish dinner here on a wed night arriving about 9pm. At 10pm the staff staring sweeping up around us and as soon as we had put our cutlery down the bill was brought to us without being asked for. My husband attempted to register a complaint to the extensive cleaning going on around us but the server interrupted him, tapped her watch and said that they were closed and that we needed to pay. This was the first indication we were given of a closing time and delivered in a completely unapologetic manner. We asked to speak to the manager and had to wait 10 minutes. In the end, we asked for the service to be taken off the bill which caused consternation and was initially met with the response that she couldn't do this. Of course it turned out to be possible - the initial refusal was just indicative of the terrible service here. The interior of this restaurant may look fine dining but it's the only part that can be described as such. Please save your time and money - there are so many better options in Singapore

Located in a mall this is well-decorated and seems up-scale. But appearances are deceiving. Service was slow and the dishes all arrived simultaneously--appetizer, both entrees and rice. By the time we finished the appetizer, the other dishes were cold. This is not a cheap place and we feel we did not get much value
5
Was here for lunch with wife daughter and grandson.The food was exceptionally good and the service exquisite.I do not remember the names of the dishes ordered but all the food from starters to main course was excellent.A must visit if fond of Thai cuisine.I am told it is rated as one of the best restaurants for the same
1
This got to be the worst meal I had out for awhile..., service sucks. Dishes came haphazardly.
Red curry never came and that was my son's special 21 st Birthday celebration!
Don't come if you are planning a special meal. Not worth it.
5
Loved the place.
The beef green curry is awesome. Great taste and the right portion.
Service is excellent and quality of food very good.
2
After many memorable meals at the Patara, off Regent Street London, this Singapore outpost was a complete disappointment. The food was bland, and amateur. London prices for not even food court food.
3
I have been a follower of patara for many years. Go mainly because of the dessert buffet, but prices in general have climbed so much that it is really not worth any more :(
4
Great place to visit with family and kids! The food is authentic, service prompt & with a smile! The ambience welcoming with lots of space between tables and I was delighted to visit this restaurant a second time after a couple of years. No doubt I'll want to revisit some time sooner!

I am sorry I didnt read some of the last reviews on this place. Arrived in on spec. Eventually got to order our food, but 10 minutes later they hadnt come for a drinks order. My wife went for a glass of the premium house white wine which while nice didnt even fill half the glass and at Sgd 24 was a complete rip-off. Food was served haphazardly ie main courses delivered 10 minutes apart. We were talked into having a large bowl of rice for 3 of us which arrived before the first main course did. By the time the last main arrived the rice was cold - we ordered a further bowl which never arrived (boiled rice is obviously a scarce commodity in a Thai restaurant). When the bill arrived we found that we were charged sgd 16 for bottled water which was on the table when we arrived.The food by the way was mediocre - main courses at Sgd 29 and Sgd 26 so would have expected much better.Some of the waitresses did not speak english, they were clearly ill trained and over worked. I asked to speak to the manager however she had 'stepped out'. She did arrive back before we left but sent one of the few waitresses who could speak english to deal with us.Overall the worst eating out experience we have had in Singapore - Never againPS they tried to charge for the rice they never gave us
1
Booked this place because Jim Thompson was full. We made a booking for 8pm, informed them that we'd be 10mins late - yet we were made to wait for 10mins. We ordered 2 starters - one was served with the main course and one never came. Food was most haphazardly served and the waitress had no clue what was going on. Taste was just OK - nothing to write home about. These guys ruined my son's birthday. When I complained to the Manager at the end - Eduardo -, he was apologetic and offered not to charge us for the meal - but I declined and paid - its not the money - its the overall experience which we came for. Later I realized that they also overcharged us for a dish which was not served. So, if anyone is looking for a NASTY roadside food joint experience in an upmarket Mall of Singapore - do visit Patara at Tanglin Mall. ...SHAME

had not been to patara for a while. the last post on patara was almost a year on 29.7.2013.we decided to take advantage of the ongoing amex promotion which gave 1 person free or 33% discount for 3pax.the tomyam tally (seafood) was chokeful of ingredients, prawns, scallops, sotong & sliced coconut. flavourful but we thought it was far too spicy this time.thai stuffed chicken wings not my favourite but they were good standard.we asked the chief waiter whether we should order the roast duck curry or belly pork curry. he recommended the later. it was a very good recommendation. the belly pork was very tender & the curry flavour was excellent.we decided to skip the whole garoupa dish which we ordered every time & try something new. we picked the alaskan crab legs in yellow curry. it cost S$39++ same as the garoupa. we would have been much better off with the garoupa. this dish was very expensive with just about 5 crab leg sections. the yellow curry was too thin. to me it was not worth the price even with 33% discount.pataraâ€™s olive rice was as perfect as ever. overall the cost came to S$105nett after 33% discount, which was quite fine for 5 dishes, though i was not much into the stuff chicken wing & the alaskan crab was a rip-off!

The food is always authentic and consistent. Being going here for more than 10 years now. If dining over the weekend opt for the ala carte buffet (S$39++ per person), best way to try everything on the menu! My fav's are the olive rice, green curry, prawns with peppercorn and mango salad
3
A friendly welcome was actually the highlight of our visit.The menu is not authentic Thai but Thai with a twist which does not quite work.No dish had a wow factor and the curries had been westernized to the point of blandness.You feel they should do much better for what is not cheap at all.Service was patchy and it is hard to justify a return visit
5
I only found this little gem of a restaurant on my last night in Singapore. The food was amazing. Sevice was very attentive. Will definitely go back when in Singapore again.

Authentic Thai fare on offer in a classy restaurant with courteous service with a smile, plenty of space between tables!

Picked this place partly because they had a good deal with Amex cards - 40% off on mondays and tuesdays! They do 15% off the rest of the weekWe ordered a mixture of traditional favorites and their specials - chili lime steamed fish, stuffed chicken wings, soft shell crab, tom yum soup, morning glory with shrimp paste and fried garoupaThe steamed fish and morning glory were quite good and standard fare. The soft shell crab was extra crunchy compared to most place, interesting texture. The wings, garoupa and soup were a bit blahoverall, because this place was in a mall, there is not much of an ambience. After discount, it came up to $40 per person, which meant about $70 before. That would have been overly expensive. It may have been the 2 fish we ordered too, but even then ..

Although in Tanglin Mall you dont feel like you are eating in a mall which is a positive experience for me. The menu is quite comprehensive but full of well balanced unusual combinations of dishes. We've been in the evening for a la carte as well as on Sunday for the "all you can eat" brunch both of which are excellent. It is child friendly too

We tried Patara based solely on the favourable write up in TA. The Food was good but quite expensive for Singapore. Unfortunately the ambiance is spoiled by the situation of the restaurant in a mall so in the evening you find yourself in a fairly quiet place with little atmosphere and no passing or walk in customer traffic. We arrived at 21.00 and were told we had to place our orders before 21.45 latest. When we eventually left at 10.30 pm the mall was closed and all doors locked with no one around so we feared we were locked in until we eventually found our way out though a rear service door. The restaurant staff gave no warning of this so maybe there are previous customers somewhere in the mall still trying to get out ?! Sum it up decent meal but spoiled by the situation and resulting ambience

I took my wife there for her birthday. I read the mixed reviews but I figured they've been around for a long time in a prime location catering to a very discerning and high end market. They couldn't be as bad as some of the negative reviews.Sure enough. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The foodt and service were great. We started with papaya salad and coconut soup for starters with a bottle of sauvignon blanc. Spicy salad and soup but excuisite tasting.Our main courses were the steamed salmon fillet and herb spring chicken. They were also so tasty, though they were not hot enough, both in temperature or spice, for our expectations.The service was excellent, with their head waiter, Edward, taking care of our needs and providing excellent advice qach step of the way.We will be back.

Had dinner here two weeks ago. Service was atrocious. Food was poor. But, having frequented their restaurants in London for many years decided to try it again. Unfortunately the service was even worse. The food is ok, but had to return a dish because it was missing the seafood. All in, an awful experience, service terrible, wrong dish and way too expensive for what you get. I will not return.

Went there for lunch with friends. The tasting menu for lunch was good but came at S$68 per head.... The service was top notch and it is recommended that you reserve ahead....The atmosphere was good and has the mix of tourists, locals and business types..

This Thai restaurant has been open for over 10 years, and our family has been a big fan of its food. Recently we tried the weekend buffet at $40 per person. It was great as they can serve small portions for 2 person, and we managed to order most of our favorites: papaya salad, fish cakes, garoupa fillets and red ruby. The service was a little bit slow but the food more than made up for it. We hope Patara will keep on going for many more years to come

We visited Patara for dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a great choice!Location: Tucked away from the hustle of Orchard Rd on the 3rd floor of the Tanglin Mall.Cost: $150 for dinner for 2 adults and an older child. This included 3 main courses, a salad, dessert, two drinks and a glass of wine.Food: Excellent! We loved the seafood in herbs salad and the red curry and pad thai were delicious. When my daughter did not care for her dish, she was immediately served another. Our salad arrived first followed by our main courses. Everything was served fresh and hot. This is atypical in Singapore. Service: Excellent! Our waitress was very attentive. Our daughter spilled her glass of water (all over me). The manager immediately moved us to another table and cleaned up the mess

Very good selection of authentic Thai dishes
Pleasant atmosphere
Top quality warm service
4
Tasty appetizers like spicy pomelo salad and fried buffalo chicken wings, green curry, fried broccoli and steamed spicy fish. The sticky rice and mangoes together with iced Thai tea or hot lemongrass tea are a great way to end a wholesome meal!
4
Really nice Thai food of traditional appeal but with that element of perfection which sometimes overides the main theme! Service always comes with a smile. A bit off the main beat for restaurants being located in Tanglin Mall but a great place to take work associates and friends alike. I eat here quite often when in Singapore and am always greeted with the utmost attention. The scallop dish is my favourite.....Served in the shell and topped with Thai spices for that extra zing!Well worth a visit if you'r wanting a quiet night out and a classy Thai meal

Great Thai food. The Tanglin Mall feels an odd place for a Thai restaurant, but do not fear, the food is very good and of a high standard. The service is attentive yet polite. As with most Thai restaurants you do leave feeling a little hungry and wondering what's in the cupboards when you get home, but despite the small portions, the food is very tasty and beautifully presented. Cost is actually quite reasonable if you stay away from the alcohol, but then again, that applies to every restaurant in Singapore. We tried their lemon grass tea, which was oddly pleasant. Can't remember all the names of the dishes, but all were very good.

I had dinner at Patara Thai last week-- we were in a group of five people. Each of us ordered the Prix Fixe, and we also had a bottle of wine. It was expensive ($700 for 5 people) but the food and atmosphere met our expectations, and the service by most of the staff was good. It would have been an overall lovely evening, except for one waitress who marred an otherwise pleasant experience. I'm not sure why, but our main waitress was clearly not happy with our party, and although she did not say anything downright rude or condescending to any of us, her attitude was contemptuous. Here are some examples:1. We had placed our order through a man (I think he was the manager or the maitre d'), but our waitress brought out the first course-- the 5 bowls of soup. Since all the soups looked alike (there were 2 different kinds), we asked her which one was which. Again, it's hard to describe because she didn't say anything directly antagonistic, but she was very impatient when we asked her to identify the soups , and insisted that she gave the right soups to the right people. We were doubtful so when the man who took our order came by, we asked him. We ended up having to switch a couple bowls of soup among us. This was alright with us but it is just irksome that she didn't bother to find out for us, and we had to find out from someone else.2. All the dishes came at once, and my friend asked her what some of the dishes were. We could sense her annoyance by her facial expressions and her dismissive tone. I'm not sure why she was annoyed to have to tell us what the dishes were since there were about 8 or more dishes to share on the table and we couldn't be expected to know, ourselves, which was which.3. When serving us rice, she spilled some on my lap. It's not the rice in my lap that annoyed me so much, but rather her callous response when I asked her to bring me a napkin to clean it up. She turned to me and quite aggressively told me to wait until she was finished. What an offensive attitude! It was as if we were not complying to her "good customer" code of conduct. Her attitude throughout the meal remained the same-- impatient and dismissive.For this caliber and "priceyness" of restaurant, this level of service is quite bad. I highlight that this waitress was not abusive or rude directly. Nevertheless, she did not hide her displeasure at having to serve us and made it quite clear that she was not pleased with us. Perhaps we asked too many questions. Perhaps she didn't feel like working that day. In addition, I emailed the managing organization for Patara Thai, Creativeateries, 9 days ago, but no response

I have been to Patara three times now when in Singapore. Stumbled across by chance when visiting the Tanglin mall where it is located while staying at Traders hotel. My first time there was alone and for the two second ones I was with friends; we all found the food, the ambiance and the wine list simply excellent. There is finesse in preparing the simplest things such as Morning Glory with a touch of garlic and chili and for vegetarians like me, many options. One friend chose seafood and only to judge by comments and the presentation, it was equally fine. I've read some of the more negative comments here and well note them. Perhaps I should mention that I went there for dinner and each time the experience was a positive one. The availability of fine French and international wines certainly add to the fine dining experience. To be noted as well is the decoration; a water feature, flowers and some old Thai items add to the charm. The lighting is warm and the ambiance inviting in the evening time. Yes, it is a little bit pricey, but for me it was repeatedly worth it. Will certainly return and recommend a visit here
5
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. The food is always top-notch, though as several have said here, it's a little pricey. On weekends from 12:30-2pm they have an all-you-can-eat buffet for $39++. It's a good way to sample many of their dishes for a more reasonable price. Rather than being a buffet line of food all set out on tables getting cold, you order what you want from a menu that's a decent sub-set of their full menu. Go with your friends and go hungry

Had a great lunch at Patara, located in Tangling Mall for my birthday.Great food, good service and ok ambiente.Thanks to the good ingredients they use the taste is great.Try the steamed seabass with garlic and chilly, amazing, as well as the thai Ota, a must on your next visit
4
I have now been here on a few occasions with colleagues. It is located right next to Trader's Hotel, which has been the venue for quite a few conferences and this has been the designated 'out-of-hotel' dinner. Each time I have been here the food has been superb. In general, Thai food is hard to come by in Singapore at local prices, and this is no exception. It ranks alongside western restaurant prices. While I wouldn't say it gives good value for money, it certainly does give you good quality Thai food. The ambiance of the place is also good even though it is on an upper floor of a shopping mall, something I'm still not used to
4
The food more than makes up for the not so great setting. The mince pork/ chicken with thai basil is excellent (It's not on the menu, but they will make it for you on request). So is the olive fried rice. The green curry is not spicy as would be expected, but yummy nonetheless. Have been here several times with friends... will admit we've had the same dishes every time... cos they are SO GOOD! If you live around the area and are looking for good Thai food on a weekday (given the location and ambiance, I wouldn't recommend it for special weekend outings), do try Patara
