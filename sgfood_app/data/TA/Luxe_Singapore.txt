Great food, great ambience, great service! Love the taste of the food and drinks and the attentiveness of service staff. A tad pricey though.

We came for brunch on a weekday and the owner whom hosted us was very friendly and polite. Ambience was really nice and the food was really delicious! We had a wonderful time spent there.

What a beautiful cafe. Enjoy the deco, service, and attentiveness of the owner and staff. Food on the other hand has some room for improvement.
3
Nice interior although a bit stark when it’s early. Richard is awesome, always super chilled. Food is simple but fresh and pretty good quality. Bar Picolo upstairs worth a visit!

Had dinner at Luxe. First time and by coincidence.
We had roasted green peppers - Spanish style, a couple of rib eye steaks from NZ and a glass of red wine.
Perfect. About S$120.
Nice casual friendly atmosphere helped by the staff.
We will return.

After being referred by a local expat, myself and 2 friends visited last sunday morning for breakfast. It's super. Will definitely return when I visit Singapore again. The service provided was great and the food awesome.

Had Eggs Benedict there 03 March 2018. Served on sourdough bread with regular bacon instead of Canadian bacon. Crust on the bread was so tough, I had to really work on it to get it into bite size portions. First mouthful was extremely salty. Coffee was unremarkable. Better places to eat on that street. With service charge and taxes, bill came to SGD $31.00+Rating bullets here don’t work. I’ll give this overall rating of 2 stars

I enjoyed this restaurant not only because of it's food but also because of its all round aesthetic and atmosphere. The food was of great quality and tasted amazing. The service was not the best but it was okay. The gentleman serving us seemed to be in a rush. The restaurant in general was exceptional, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the location very much
4
Service crew was friendly and helpful.Food was ok. 3/5 items were not available which was tad disappointing.Atmosphere was perfect for group gathering.Last but not least, Luxe served wine on the house which I thought was the best thing to end the night. And the moscato was amazing. Thanks Luxe Sydney

We went to Luxe for breakfast a few days ago. All of us had Luxe Plate—their very hearty breakfast— comprising of Poached eggs, Avocado, Roasted tomatoes with cumin, Marinated Goat cheese and Sourdough Toast with butter. The freshest of ingredients are used and that makes it Luxe. The Americano coffee was absolutely delicious. The ambience is nice and the restaurant opens onto the park behind. It’s rather pricey but worth the experience. Would love to go back for more of the freshest breakfast another morning
5
Australia style food and i love the food and interior, service is great and attentive. would definitely come back again
4
love the grilled prawns. this is the 2nd time the beer battered fish was sold out, what a pity. luxe burger was great
3
Salad was fresh. Service was good. But personally i dun really like the lighting....to dark. I will recommend there for drinking and not friend gathering coz place very noise, very hard to talk to each other...
5
Great ambience and even better than my last visit. New menu and drinks with a rooftop bar. Awesome.
Must visit and see for yourself.
5
We work just around the corner and luxe has now become our 'go to' place! They offer tasty salads for the 'good' days but even better burgers for the naughty days! ....That is if we have space after breakfast! I normally opt for a classic 'Sydney breakfast' with scrambled eggs, sourdough and avocado! I highly recommend starting your day with one of these!
3
Never a good thing or start to a meal when on a quiet friday the restaurant says that they can't do the two things that you and your guest want from their relatively small menu....why was it so hard to do crab salad and fish and chips on a friday? the restaurant wasn't even full....what we had was fine but nothing special, service was businesslik
5
Sometimes I crave a tasty western styled breakfast. I am from Sydney and was so excited to try the omelette at Luxe Sydney, it was the best breakfast I have had in Singapore since moving here in 2012. The sour dough bread was thinly sliced, which meant it was easier to eat and the omelette had the right amount of feta inside to give a delicious flavour without over riding the other flavours. The coffee was good as well. The service was so good, every staff member looked happy to be there and were very attentive. I'm looking forward to returning

We were out shopping in the evening and wanted to treat ourselves for a dinner whilst we were visiting this area in Chinatown. Although we've been here for Saturday night drinks for a friend's birthday last year, we decided to try it for dinner with it's modern menu. We had a few glasses of wine and three courses, but we were probably early for it to be busy. Great food and service, we thought it was reasonable value. What we found interesting was the open plan kitchen so you could see the work that goes into producing your dinner.
4
Met up with a for coffee on a Saturday afternoon. The place was not full so it was fairly quiet. We took the sofa area and was able to enjoy some privacy, from other diners although you get to see everyone who comes in. Coffee was good (from Dutch Colony) and hot cake was also good. Looks quite heavy on calories so ok to share and have it with coffee.
5
Perfect food, service and ambience! Definitely a favorite for western food! The food is great and not as pricey as one might think! I came for brunch once but was overwhelmed by the queue (probably becos of the rave reviews) so decided to try the dinner. Been here a few times and it's consistently great!
1
When we kindly asked for a change of the chipped plate, waiter brushed us off by saying, "This is part of the design. Most of our plates are like this."; and refused to entertain our concern. Note: the plate for my partner was normal

Steak was about average, desserts were good. Wouldn't come here for dinner next time, just desserts.
4
Had the one-for-one wine for my TGIF. I did enjoy the ambience a lot and wonder how's the food like. Besides the service crew were very welcoming too. Will be back for the brunch very soon.
4
I have been going to Luxe for a while now and love it! Every time I go, it does not disappoint. I tend to judge a breakfast place on simply being able to cook every element on the plate correctly and tasting delicious. This is Luxe! I favour the poached eggs on toast with marinated goats cheese and avocado and then add bacon! Yummy! Service is always attentive and you never feel like you are being hurried or needing to leave!Plenty of space between tables so again it all has a relaxing feel to it! I have taken friends there and it is now their favourite breakfast place
4
Great place to have brunch! Their menu items are simple but delicious. It's a good place to have a savory brunch before hitting the city.I just had the eggs with sour dough bread and ordered an extra side of bacon. Because breakfast won't be complete without bacon! My total bill was about 21 SG.
5
Had our first experience at Keong Saik Rd on Friday night and had a great night out. Staff at Luxe were very friendly and the service was great. I had the polenta fries and the salmon for the main and it was deliscious. Was a relaxed atmosphere and would definitely recommend to others.
5
Came for dinner with some friends during the week. It wasn't overly busy but there was a good atmosphere. The menu was just the right size with a great option choice. All the food was delicious and the staff (especially the owner) was accommodating in going off-menu for us along with being helpful with choice selections and recommendations
2
Was here for a casual business meeting, arrived before the lunch crowd hit and was pleasantly surprised at the lovely space. Not too bright, soft atmosphere. But when lunch crowd appeared, the noise in the cafe was unbearable. Staff was lovely and preempted the situation, offered us a different seat in the corner of the cafe, although it only helped a little. Struggled to have a conversation. Food was average, really expensive simple dishes you can do at home
2
We've been a few times now and whilst I initially felt the service was patchy, the reality is that the service is weak. We repeatedly had to ask for them to bring drinks orders which they had seemingly forgotten, the waiters didn't seem to know what was finished and what was still available and it just seemed that the waiting staff was never really available - and it wasn't even that busy.The food is definitely the redeeming feature here, and whilst not a favourite of mine the parmesan doughnuts seemed to go down particularly well.The calamari was a little underwhelming, but the steak was very nicely done.A mixed bag really. Nice atmosphere, but don't go if you are particular about good service
5
We ventured out of our normal date night place and tried Luxe and loved it so much. Amazing food with a menu so great it was hard to chose, gorgeous atmosphere, didn't break the bank. Can't wait to go back.
5
What a great place to eat and have brunch. Food quality, service and ambience was top notch. Would definitely recommend for friends and families.
4
Went there on a Tuesday where they had a special for two steaks. The food was great and the staff were very friendly too.
5
Informal enough to be friendly, but comfortable enough to talk turkey. The food is good and the vibe continues after hours - fantastic happy hour as well! Good coffee!
3
my first time there. Service is good and friendly, some dishes are good, others are so so. I found the place very noisy
3
Is the great place to hang out with a group of friend, dating and cheer. The food is average and overprice.
3
Went there with a group of people, and had a great brunch. It's difficult to have a conversation because of the noise but food and drinks were very nice
3
Visited Luxe because it was recommended as one of the top cafes to visit. While the ambience is nice, I can't say the same about the food. Ordered a very disappointing cheeseburger - the patty was too salty (I'm used to eating salty food so when I find it salty means it is really salty) and the single layer of cheese was pathetic. My friends ordered the prawn linguine and it was more palatable. It's not the kind of cheeseburger than I was expecting - oozing with juice from the beef patty and cheese. Overall, the experience was average
5
I have been numerous times with family, friends and even colleagues. It is simply a honest and lovely place to catch up, chill as well as dining alone.I gathered all these feedbacks from the people I brought and eventually had my company's dinner at Luxe. Everyone totally enjoyed that night.Drinks were awesome, food is fresh and staffs were friendly. A dining/chillout place where we can all be ourselves
4
Close to where we live. We tried it first on the Entertainer voucher meaning we got a free main course. HH until 7pm also. The meals each time were excellent and our favourite is the charcoal bun burger - superb! The owner came to speak to us and was very friendly and welcoming. We will certainly be back
3
Overall good Ambience and Food. Nice chill out place but service could be friendlier. Would've visited the place earlier if not for average reviews from fellow colleagues and friends.
4
Good food and polite service. Great value on burger night. Wine and beer list appeared reasonably priced. Nice evening out.
5
Ben oui, TripAdvisor like us to speak a lot when we just feel to say : "perfect" !!! Ok, let talk talk !
4
We were looking for a restaurant in this neighbourhood and were actually targetting for a chinese restaurant. But then we saw this nice entrance and discovered quite a good restaurant : nice ambiance, nice food (loved my meat !) and good service.
4
I love the atmosphere & interior of the cafe, service crews are friendly & they serve a variety of food. Taste good & look good as well!
3
Just returned from Sydney on Sunday and by coincidence was invited to have lunch here on Monday.The Singaporean Chinese waitress who served us was, to be kind, 'curt' - and also a little clumsy. She seemed to be more concerned about strutting around and being a waitress than actually being a good waitress. It was like being back in Sydney. Low power distance and all...Vennue was extremely noisy because of poor acoustics and the schnitzel I ordered had the crust peeling away from the meat - which was too red for my liking.Will give them another chance as I work in the same building and hopefully the next experience will be better.
3
We've been a few times here, and sometimes it's been excellent whilst other times - particularly for dinner - they appear to be a bit overwhelmed both in the kitchen and out front too. The result is that service can be patchy, and food not quite spot on, during busier periods. I'd therefore recommend going earlier in the evening and probably worth having a few cocktails there too.
5
Friendly and efficient service with an excellent European based menu. We really enjoyed the whole experience here and would not hesitate to recommend this if you are looking for a mid range budget meal in a relaxing environment. As always in Singapore, wine is very expensive but that's the same wherever you go
4
I had an amazing experience on my first visit for lunch and decided to have a gathering with friends before new year 's eve. Was utterly disappointed with the veal schnitzel which I ordered as it was thick and not thin as what I expected and was tough too. Other then my main course, all other main courses from my friends were excellent and side dishes too. We loved the peanut butter shake.
4
I went with friends for a pre-Christmas gathering. Decoration of the restaurant is very good, spacious and homey - a good place for gathering. Food is tasty as well. Only one down-side which is the aircond was dripping water, and I told the waiter about it. However, he just take a cloth and wipe the water off, where I am just sitting under the aircond. I suggest they can either fix the aircond or change a table for guest.
5
nice food. we had the charcoal burgers. very prompt service, and excellent ambience. service was very good. the maideline desserts with kaya (local flavours) is nice!!
4
Although the place got quite noisy after 7, the food was great, service was prompt and attentive! The turmeric chicken was aromatic and flavourful, pulled pork burger was tender and generous. Prices are slightly high though
4
Good food, though priced a bit on high side with the cuisine. A bit too dark at the corner that we were seated. Can't take very good pictures. Service staff were very attentive. Overall good experience.
4
Portions were generous and food was tasty! Though admittedly prices were on the higher end. Would return.
4
The food was great. My friend and I order the chicken and the burger. I especially love the chill-out atmosphere. Service provided was prompt and fast. The staffs are all very attentive to your dining needs.
4
The food was good, especially the burgers! Service was rather slow. They seemed a little short-handed.
4
A great relief when one needs a break from the seafood and noodles. A bit of an expat hangout, staff friendly although have the usual Asian reticence to smile first. Great menu. Even better coffee. Very glad we stumbled on it.
3
Food is ok, a bit on the salty side for me and I take quite a bit more salt than I should. Menu range is pretty good. Burger was juicy. Barramundi was done well. Portions are pretty good. That donut starter thing was forgettable. Drinks were ok, daiquiri was forgettable though but perhaps I was expecting a frozen one, should have asked. Service was really good. But the place was very, VERY NOISY. Left soon because we couldn't hear ourselves think. I think for big rowdy groups this is a great place
5
I really enjoyed having lunch here recently. I had a salad which was the complete opposite of a usual boring unimaginative salad. It was creative, full of interesting ingredients and tasted delicious. I had fresh orange juice with the salad and felt inspired and energised after lunch. You can't say that for many meals ! The restaurant is relaxed which is a great escape from a stressed out world ! Loved it ! I'll be back again, thanks
3
The set up of the restaurant is interesting - with low ceiling, this meant the the lasting memory we will have was the noise. One loud table and the whole place was so noisy we left as quickly as possible.Service great - charming and attentive staff. Appetisers - good nice flavours especially the sausage roll, mains average at best, very small portion of meat in both burgers with a massive quantities of carbs (chips and bun). Dessert - fine but not memorable. The location is great interesting part of the city - but Luxe is not one of our best food experiences in Singapore
5
Had a biz lunch yesterday here, the falafel salad with braised lamb was fantastic, others all seemed to have enjoyed theirs as well, will definitely be back
5
Good for breakfast, good for lunch and great for coffee.
The salads are fresh and light, perfect for Singapore weather. They've done a good job transporting the popular and successful Luxe from Sydney to the Singapore cafe scene.
5
Love it
-Yummy food!
-Nice and Strong Ice latte.
-Lovely people/Team (Manager Richard Letch)
What more can one ask from a restaurant? ^^
Will come back for sure with friends and family <3
Thank you Luxe Singapore!
Vincent

Enjoyed the meal (: The portion of the fries was big, even for 2 person. We had our reservations at 7pm but the restaurant was still kinda quiet, we were the only ones there.
5
Great service, good food and most importantly the coffee was on par with the best that you can get in Australia, a must go for Australian expats living in Singapore
5
I stumbled upon Luxe whilst hungry for lunch, feeling like some interesting contemporary food, and dining alone I felt very comfortable and welcome! The staff, food and atmosphere were fantastic, 'a little bit of Sydney in Singapore ' really says it all! We'll be back for a good coffee later too
4
Staffs are very attentive and friendly.Food wise, buratta was hard, prawns in the linguine was too soft(like its been in a hot water too long after pre-cooked kind) but linguine was al dente. Fries that comes w the Luxe Burger was way too salty. Still have room for improvement! Love the dip for the salt and pepper squid.Ambience, faultless! White, simple and spacious! Love the ambience!I would say, 6/10 for food and 10/10 for ambienc
4
Had lunch here with the family. Ordered a burger, the meat was dry and the bun cold. The others though enjoyed their food (steak, omelette and chicken salad). Service was good, as were the fresh fruit juices. Super location in the hip part of Chinatown. Will give it another chance
4
We reserved only for 6 via Chope and Luxe followed up with a call 1 hour before reservation time to confirm the pax and time. We had actually 7 adults and a 3-month old in the end! Service was friendly, just that during peak dinner time they were busy and was a tad hard to get their attention. The burgers tasted good but we find the helping really big for Asian diners. We love the desserts and would definitely visit again for brunch
5
I was just walking this picturesque street and got pulled into this restaurant due to the open doors. Asked what kind of food it was and the waitress couldn't answer. I asked if it was fusion and got a horrified "No!" I guess it's modern Australian. Very good though and very sleek, contemporary, light design. Good coffee for the morning too
5
Wonderfully fresh and interesting menu; healthy options. Staff very enthusiastic and helpful to offer suggestions. We were biased to enjoy an 'Aussie' type meal but it was very well prepared with great service.
3
Nice place. Ordered the luxe burger. However, food is salty to my tasting. But the good staff service and ambience makes up the night
4
The food was good and the service perhaps even better with a constant refill of icewater and just in general very attentive. Ambience is nice, but nothing special when compared to other places in the area. Prices are rather expensive compared to other places.
4
It's my third visit this year. They use only fresh ingredients and service is prompt. Love the burrata with pear, mushroom burger and pulled pork burger. My parents are not fond of western food, but even they enjoyed their orders of fish and lamb. Staff was friendly and prompt. This might sound strange, but I also like the hand wash that they provided in the washroom.My only gripe is the noise. We had some difficulty hearing each other. Not sure if something can be done about the acoustics.About 200+ for 5 adults.Reservations needed.
3
Excited that we had a new Aussie style cafe to try, however went in open minded with the mixed reviews in Luxe. Located behind the pinnacle HDB complex, locale is reasonably central. 1st impression was funky, open & bright space. We arrived early, 9:20am on a Saturday & were the 1st patron but another 4 couples came with next 10 minutes. 1st round of short macchiato's were good, but 2nd were quite bitter. Service nothing special ... read, no energy or enthusiasm. Food here is ok to good. My partner had the Quinoa & Chia seed pudding with coconut yogurt & fresh fruit (today was passionfruit, dragonfruit & banana) & it was delicious! I had the mushroom breakfast with feta (+side of bacon) which was ok, though the sourdough bread wasn't toasted which was strange & didn't work (think very soggy quickly). We'll try Luxe again for dinner as menu looks excite, though hope it's a bit better next tim
3
Look, it's a lively, loud, light cafe/restaurant that serves your typical brunch fare.Food was great - eggs etc.Coffee - unfortunately served luke warm to almost cold - so some improvements needed. (After al it is a cafe - so important to get the basic right ....right?)Yes it's tough times for the industry and cafes/restaurants need to get the most turnover of people / profit - but seriously making your guests move tables while they are actually eating because you want to fit more people in... Not classy and reflects what you really think about the guests experience. Return visit .... No.
5
I came a couple of times and the recommendations by the wait staff were always spot on. Particularly kudos to the staff who noted that on my first visit, the pasta was oversalted yet flavourless, and he specially served me the next time I visited. Sad to say though, the kitchen does have much catching up to do with their service crew. Pricing is expensive and food average at best, probably warrants a 2.5 - 3 star for value and food. but all 5 stars awarded goes to the service team
1
6 of us were there for sunday brunch and the whole experience left us disappointed. We ordered a variety of food, Bondi breakfast set, their signature Luxe burger, pasta, salads, drinks and their branded "keong siak" fried chicken. First of all, the juices that were served seems to be pressed before hand. It taste nothing like freshly squeezed juices. Then came the Bondi breakfast which was order by 4 people on the table. The breakfast was super ordinary, certainly does not taste anything like the good quality breakfast served on the Bondi area. The Luxe burger was supposed to be their signature dish but it failed miserably. It is nothing compared to the fantastic burgers served by potato head folk which is just steps down the road. I would even trade macdonalds burger for the burger i had at Luxe. The burger was basically tasteless. Already feeling disappointed, then came the "keong Siak" fried chicken. 1st look, it was super ordinary and the chicken seems over fried. True enough, its taste exactly like what we expect, dry and nothing compared to the chicken wings served at Potato Head nor korean chicken joint.The total bill came up to $44 per pax for the kind of food which we will not even pay $20. It is such a waste that the quality of food and value totally spoils the good decor of the restaurant. I urge the restaurant to look at the quality of food and prices if they are serious about being in the business for long
3
I think lunchtime is the ideal time to visit it when you can enjoy the natural lighting complementing the light bright colour scheme and the food is also more suitable for lunch. We went there in the evening and it doesn't have the greatest ambience as it is very noisy due to the acoustics so much so you can hardly hear each other speak even when sitting at the same table. The burgers are really good quality, extremely tasty and just the right size - not to big, not to small. The steak however is very underwhelming, it tasted like frozen meat with hardly any flavour and certainly not worth the $42 price.
5
I walk passed this place so many time but the outside white color never hit my eyes. Apparently when I saw this place I was on da way to other coffee shop nearby and accidently saw it. Decorations inside looks quite nice. As soon as I sat down the waitress brought me a full jug of ice water. I had lunch already that day. So, I was ordered only a cup of coffee. Flat White was very good in terms of taste, aroma, acidity, body and aftertaste. The temperature was right. Free WiFi available here.. Didn't use it though. Likely after I finish all my coffee places lists.. I will be back for sure.
3
Came here with a friend for lunch last week. We both chose the Luxe Burger which was pretty good but perhaps a bit overpriced at $27++. Service was efficient and friendly and no reservation was required.
5
We love the food, service & ambiance.
Recommended to have the meal with your family & friends! It would be better if the staff sing "Happy Birthday" song together with us. Remember to download Entertainer App, you will get 1 for 1 main course. :)
5
Great brunch. Service was very friendly and the restaurant has a trendy vibe to it. It was about 25$ a plate but delicious.
5
Excellent experience at Luxe Sydney. Great food, amazing service. I ate there twice (during lunch and dinner) and was very happy. The service was done by the owner, who was extremely attentionate and caring.
4
Very impressed with the deco and renovations when I first stepped into the restaurant. Food was good, a tad too generous on the salt for some dishes though.
4
Great coffee, great eggs, fantastic location in the heart of Chinatown. Worth a visit if you miss the Sydney/Melbourne/Auckland premium cafe experience.
3
Luxe is beautiful and the service is top notch. I ordered the hamburger and it was good and looked amazing. But it was not special. It was basically average. I asked for a salad instead of fries and that consisted of about 5 forkfuls of kale and rocket with a so-so dressing.I also had a pressed apple juice for $7. Not sure if people go here for the food or to just sit in the beautiful restaurant and feel special for paying exorbitant prices for pub food.
5
A modern restaurant with dynamic staff (actually served by the owner on the day) and great brunch. Quality ingredients, good service and a pleasant ambience. Highly recommend egg Benedictine with Avocado on the side. It is very popular hence some queuing may be necessary. House prosecco is very good and reasonably priced
5
Myself and my partner have eaten here a few times now and haven't been disappointed. We initially noticed the restaurant when we moved close to Keong Saik road a few months back and when we realised it allowed Entertainer vouchers, we gave it a try. We've had a beautiful chicken dish, veggie options (Falafel was excellent), salmon and the incredible Luxe burger - we loved them all. Parmesan doughnuts to start and choc brownie to end were other highlights! You can see we're working our way around the menu and haven't had a bad course yet. The staff are extremely welcoming and the manager pops down several times over your evening to make sure everything is ok. Your glass never goes dry and there's a very reasonable HH also - $8 drafts and $5.5 glass of wine. We can't recommend this place highly enough so if you're around the area, make sure to check it out
4
The food was perfectly cooked and very tasty but the portion sizes were a bit small. The menu is a bit limited for an evening meal. The waiter listed a number of items that weren't available which was disappointing considering it was only 7.30 on a Saturday evening.
5
Recommendable branch place with good various choices of food. Nice ambience and very friendly staff.
4
Went along for brunch with friends who had a baby; the staff were very accommodating and thoughtful to the extra space etc required. Tasty seared salmon, and good coffee! Thanks guys
1
It was a gathering of 4 people. While waiting for one of our friends who was late, we ordered a salt & pepper calamari and a chicken burger to share. The calamari was terribly salty and the burger was nothing great. We told one of the waitress about the over salted calamari but her reply was "it's like that". OMG! It was as if the few pcs of calamari was cooked with the whole bottle of salt and she said "it's like that"!!! Her response was telling us that we are not the only one who complained this. We decided not to continue our dinner gathering there and instead had our dinner at a nearby coffee shop! Thanks to our friend who was late. Otherwise we can't imagine having to swallow more terrible food with a not-cheap price
4
I went with my hubby for brunch. We ordered a beef burger and a salmon brunch set, a flat white and a pineapple juice ( as in the photos), the total bill is about $75. The food is nice but such standard could easily be found in some other cafes as well. We could name a few cafes with the same standard but at least 25% cheaper.The place is almost full when we arrived. we find it too noisy to have a decent conversation. It seems that everyone is talking at the top of their voice. A nice place with nice food if you are around that area.
4
Keong Saik is famous for a good mix of restaurants and Luxe is no exception- tasteful interiors, excellent service and great food. The lamb and barramundi were beautifully done.The coffee however was slightly disappointing, no aroma wafting through.My friend from down under literally dipped her nose in the coffee but still nothing :($100 for lunch for two sans drinks. So you got to be reaally happy for a pricey lunch
5
Met friends for brunch. I had the Aussie breakfast which was delish. My friends had the granola dish which was also really good. The have a dish that oats and passion neuritis that tasted Devine. We also had a ricotta and advocado dish which was very nice. The food is more towards Aussie cuisine but from what I saw of other dishes I would go back again on next visit to Singapore. Coffee was also really good
3
We had our team dinner at Luxe Sydney in Keong Saik Road. The appetizer was good (Baratta?) and fried chicken was ok. The entree was so so. We all were not impressed with the drink at all.The ambience and interior of the restaurant looks great though. Nice and slick desig
5
Delicious! welcoming! Great offers available but I'd happily pay regular price.The staff were brilliant - always a smile and accommodated any request we had. Lovely cocktails to accompany the food. A great place to dress up or be a little more casual. Definitely will will return, thank you
5
Sometimes you can be so happy you just drop in to places. This area has nice restaurants next to each other so it was pure coincidence I picked this one. And I am not sorry I did!It was Sunday noon. The place was crowded. Very friendly young man welcomed me and I got the table, well, ok, a seat by the counter, in minutes.After ordering I had time to look around. Ascetic but still elegant decoration. Very contemporary. Happy people eating their brunch, having fun together. Cool! Love places like this.As the name tells this is Sydney style restaurant. I was on my way back home from Sydney so I can say it really was! On the menu they had selection of interesting breakfast/brunch portions and other dishes too, of course.I took bruschetta with poached eggs. Food was so delicious. Made from fresh ingredients, full of flavor, beautifully plated...I will definitely give this one another change when back in Singapore. I love restaurants with good attitude and this kind of positive way to do things
4
Came here for brunch with a friend for the first time and had a good experience. Liked the setting, quite trendy and hip with a combination of normal tables and high bars. I had the poached egg with a side of spinach and smoked salmon, my friend had the eggs benedict. I enjoyed my food but it's quite standard brunch food, nothing too inventive and my friend said hers is just okay. Service was not fantastic but passable. I would come again for the atmosphere and because it's around the corner of where I live
3
Nice restaurant, looks new, and good stylish decoration.
Service was good, mainly because the restaurant was empty, it was lunch time!
Order the house burger, pretty good, big, and tasty, however, for a burger, it's very expensive!
4
The location needs a special trip to go. It is near Chinatown. The ambience is nice and cosy. Selections of dishes and beverage are of high standard with many selections. Food tastes good and creative. Service is prompt and alert.
2
Food portions were measly for the price. Although taste was above average, will not visit again as price is on the high side.
5
Impeccable service and very nice ambienace. Food is also very tasty. Its a great place for brunch and dinner. Coffee is also very good!
5
Highly recommended for brunch or dinner. We've been here a couple of times and the service and food is always impecable!

One of the more recent entrants to the local cafe scene. Expect, as you would an international cafe chain, a range of common fare. At least they do it well with a smile. And an additional plus for being at the Working Capitol.

The restaurant has bright light coming in from the street and has a nice casual decor. Pasta, salads and other choices are great. The restaurant has good service and was a bit empty during lunch. I suspect the high prices keep away daily lunch goers. Plates were in the $20 and above range. Food was good

A very busy and popular restaurant in Chinatown. We visited on Sunday and had to wait 30 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait. It is run by Australians so is nice if you want a change from Chinese food. A nice menu with freshly cooked, well presented food. mid range prices

We were so eager to try out this bright and beautiful spot on Keong Saik that we ordered 4 dishes to share between the two of us - grilled octopus with Xo sauce (chewy and didn't go well with the Xo), Parmesan donuts (hard sticks), salt and pepper calamari (too much flour and salt, overcooked squid) and an avocado, Ricotta sourdough toast platter - the best thing we had. Could it have been because the ingredients weren't touched but just sliced and plated? Sadly, we won't be bac

I was welcomed into the restaurant by what seemed to be the manager on duty. He quickly showed me to a table and was probably one of the most friendliest people I encountered in Singapore. He easily sold me on the special...chicken, duck and turkey. It tasted fantastic. My wine glass was never empty long...they really knew how to take care of a customer. The dinner here was the culinary best of my trip

The decor of the restaurant was nice but the food was normal save for the sausage roll. Had the angus ribeye steak (m. rare), calamari and sausage roll.

visited on a wednesday evening - quieter night. atmosphere was still vibrant, music not too loud, tables well spaced. excellent service from v attentive staff. we had two burgers - v good. and good value.

So many options for lunch, including a new set lunch with a choice of a main+a beer+dessert+coffee for $35.
Love that the selections include healthy food, I love the beetroot fallafel.
Doesn't hurt that the service is also very friendly.

The food is light and healthy, and it has a nice quite ambience. Service is good and the waiters are attentive.

Brunch was ok and ambience clean~ but I think it's overrated, judging by the taste of the brunch with a high price. Especially the pancake!! Please don't ever order it!!! 1 thin pathetic slice of pancake with little ricotta cheese and some berries for $20! I rather go to cafes with awesome and cheaper pancakes like Parcamara and Curious Palette. Overall experience, just one visit to this cafe and you will know what I'm saying~

Went dinner on weekday and restaurant was empty with only 2 tables occupied. Clean but classy feel. Ordered 4 mains - salmon salad, grilled chicken burger, Angus ribeye, prawn pasta) and 2 appetisers (toasted bread, calamari). All were tastefully cooked and very delicious. Service was prompt and staffs ready to serve - big plus! Overall nice to chill with friends- recommended. Spent $130 with 2 glasses of house red wine, using entertainer app

We came to try out their new brunch menu. $40 for breakfast + coffee + juice + champagneThe food is decent. They do get their egg right ;) however service wise it is a little slow as their are overwhelmed by the crowds. Our coffee came after we finished our meal, and we have reminded the staff twice for it! I will revisit the place ( for the eggs) but maybe during off peak

Went for breakfast the first time. The food menu is extensive and the coffee was hot, fresh and strong (hard to find in Singapore). Our breakfast - the Aussie and the eggs and toast were nice, nothing phenomenal but good. Service was friendly, but did not seem to be enough servers so took a while to flag them down for another round of coffees and the bill. Only real complaint is the space is SO echoey - it becomes difficult to speak across the table between just two people even though the place is not big. The acoustics definitely need some work! Overall a good concept and nice to see some decent western food coming to the area, but could step it up just a bit so they have some staying power. Prices were as per usual here, a bit much for what you actually get but comes with the neighbourhood. Will be back for another try

The food was enjoyable but the choices for the set lunch is limited. What's different from most places is that besides the main course, dessert & coffee, there's a drink (which includes wine). If you want a quiet lunch, this may be the place to go.With the many restaurants in Singapore, there are other better choices to consider

The decor of this restaurant is beautiful and instills calm and enjoyment on entering, however the menu seems to be lacking a certain je ne sais quois. It isn't a small menu, however there are a lot of dishes that are too heavy for a lunchtime sitting. We had choices off their brunch menu, simple poached on toast which was fine but not really a culinary treat. I think a few more lighter options need to be worked into the menu or a separate lunch menu should be offered.

We loved Luxe Sydney. Staff were very friendly and food and coffee were delicious. The only negative is that they only had 2 highchairs for the whole restaurant.

Great ambience and service there but perhaps could improve on the menu a little. The fish I had was too salty and the Luxe burger my friend ordered was ok.

Yesterday with my family I had a lovely Sunday at Luxe Sydney in SingaporeThe lads there have printed a great diverse and clolorful menu, with many new dishes as well as many o the old favouritesAussie breakfast was very nice with a Coopers pale ale, the girls had a bacon and egg roll and nan had a beautiful waffle ice cream and assorted berriesThe service is good the furniture is light and minimal and there is bright happy ambience a great way to spend your Sunday's getting away from the Singapore haze

We came across Luxe by accident while walking down Keong Siak Road looking for another restaurant but decided to go into Luxe for dinner and we were certainly glad we did. Unlike many upmarket restaurants in Singapore the design was perfectly understated being chic and simple rather than being over the top. By Singapore standards the menu is limited but is really interesting with some interesting Aussie twists. The olives were great and went perfectly with the draught Asahi beer. Try the parmesan doughnuts as they are so different and taste fantastic. The service was spot on throughout the night and could not be faulted. For 4 of us to go out to dinner and enjoy wine for under $300 in Singapore is unusual. Overall it was a great dinner and even my Singaporean friends who are stern food critics enjoyed the night

This week when walking around near my office in Keong Saik, a place I had never seen caught my eye… an Australian-style place, quite chic. Since I was a big fan of the food at some of the trendy Sydney places when we visited there, I decided to check out ‘Luxe’ as the restaurant is called. The design was quite cool, and the server was surprisingly friendly -- but the best part was definitely the food! We ordered the Pork Shoulder, and also grilled octopus and Spinach Pie - all tasty and a good range of dishes, even my picky colleagues were pleased... I plan to go back after work to try the Tamarind Margarita soon. Definitely something to check out -- refreshing experience and good vibe

Luxe Sydney is this Australian eateries first foray overseas. It's located in the hip enclave in Keong Saik Road, Chinatown & a must visit. I have been several times for brunch and lunch and the experiences were positive.Breakfast/brunch here is very much akin to places like Bills in Sydney. We go-to favourite is the Breakfast Bruschetta which is 2 poached eggs atop sourdough toast with tomatoes and an aromatic pesto. Just the dish to start off your weekend or indeed any day of the week. Add on an order of fennel sausages and a flat white and you're good to go.The restaurant is still developing; the menu is a small but select one. I like the Wild Weed pie for lunch which is akin to a spanakopita with flaky filo pastry. The day I went it was paired with a slightly bitter escarole salad which I loved. I also ate a lovely sashimi with bottarga shaved on top - it was refreshing and perfect for our warm weather. The chef, Chui Lee Luk is Malaysian by birth but well known in Sydney restaurant circles as that's where she makes her home. She comes in regularly to tweak the menu so there's always something new each time I visit. Service is friendly and the manager, Richard Letch is welcoming and a genuinely nice guy. Thumbs up to what he's trying to achieve with his young team.I should also mention that Luxe is also a nice place to stop by for drinks before dinner at the many restaurants in the area. The spritzers hit the spot for those who want something light and refreshing

Pleased with our choice for a birthday lunch. Our large group (10+) received exceptional service throughout the whole lunch time period we were. The starters were delicious and our whole group would recommend the Parmesan Doughnuts - sublime! Mains were fresh and enjoyable, however we should have ordered a few side dishes to accompany these. Wine choices limited, the house white wine not that pleasant. Desserts were delightful and really rounded off a very pleasant afternoon. Will definitely be back

We dined here on a Friday night for our girlfriend's birthday. The decor was immaculately done and we really enjoyed the change of ambiance in Singapore. However the food was not up to par. We had almost everything on the menu. The mushroom pasta was by far the winner along with the beetroot falafel was nice (if we had to choose a winner). Fried chicken a second but who can go wrong with fried chicken? Average was the burger. NOTHING special or worth it. Sausage roll - a definite miss. Can get this at Polar and it would have been better & cheaper. I am trying to remember the rest but it was not memorable. We ordered a few cocktails - had no dessert and when the manager came to ask us if we wanted more drinks (no - i am pregnant) coffee or dessert. We declined and was promptly given the bill. A restaurant of that caliber should know you don't give a bill to customers unless we asked for it. The wait staff was really nice. The manager should know better. I'd give this place a miss and go to the other restaurants at the same price point and more inventive on Keong Saik Street

Stopped in Luxe for a Sunday breakfast with friends. The place was full of people. Food was amazing, super tasty and fresh. Coffee is Toby's which was very good. The menu has a great selection of breakfast treats. Only downside is that the place is so noisy with people talking but its a small price to pay for such a satisfying breakfast. Prices are better than most places in Singapore for breakfast. Highly recommended

Was at Luxe pretty soon after it opened, for a business lunch. The ambiance is interesting - very chic and eye catching, the service was pretty good too, though a tad slow. They got the salads and fries after our meal was over - so, lunch hour is probably not the best time to look for efficient service. We ordered various different things. I got the Mushroom pasta and a Mocha. I also tried some of the Broccoli - Burrata salad and Parmesan Doughnuts. The salad was the highlight for me - the crunchy slightly charred Broccoli combined with creamy Burrata and caramelised onions was a great combination. The parmesan doughnut wasn't anything to write home about. The pasta was average and so was the coffee.The Luxe wasn't too bad but it's definitely not in my list of top recommendations or repeat visits
