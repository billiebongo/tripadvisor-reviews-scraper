Really superb platter of sausages - true Bavarian quality. I am not a fan of Beer but my guests, including a German guest, told me that the Beer was excellent.
5
I came here many times.it's my favorite place in Singapore.good beer and good service.when you come here you fell like home.well done guys.thank you to the management for the good job.
4
Met friends for 2 decades at the place. Sausage platter is great. A clear positive is that it shows cricket, which is uncommon in Singapore. :)
5
Izwan/Jazz is awesome and too much energetic and full of love and excellent service. He is an asset.
4
The atmosphere and space was large enough for a big group of friends. Loved the music and the live band. Food was decent. But portions should have been bigger. Sharing platters were great!
3
Paulaner is a great place but I would recommend other locations as the CQ one is always full of loud foreigners and drunken idiots!
5
We have visited a couple of times. The food is great. The wurst are great as are the schnitzels. Our daughter’s favourite are the wings, not German but good.Service is good, the music loud. There are specials on usually for drinks which make them more affordable but that is Singapore wise. If you are inside you can’t pick up the free wifi at Clark quay

Had a tasty family meal here, with quite authentic German fare. It was sometimes difficult to get the attention of the waiting staff, although it was not busy. When we ordered our desserts, o ly the children one turned up. After 15min further waiting we asked the waiter where our food was. Although he knew what we had ordered, it would still take another 10min; no explanation available. We kindly cancelled the dessert order and left after paying. Not sure what happened there.
1
Expected the standard fare from this Bavarian restaurant. Except that it was lacklustre at best. The food -Seafood Platter didn’t live up to its name but contained samosas and spring rolls. Cheap thrill. Also, the biggest disappointment was the soft and soggy pork knuckles. My NYE was spoilt.
5
Chanced upon this spot when we were craving for some authentic Bavarian beer!  The must try in their menu is definitely the pork knuckles and their sausage platter.  My personal favorite is their mushroom soup with bread dumpling and their chicken wings!!  So delicious that I can still remember the taste! 
4
Beer is good. Sausages are very nice. Pork knuckle is slightly dry.
There was a stage but no live band performance when I visited on Sunday.
4
After a day of walking and exploring this was just what the doctor ordered. Sit out and chill with cold beverages and good food. Location is great, service was strong. I would definitely return.
4
This is the place must visit especially in the evening. There are many bars in this area you can enjoy live music. If you like boat tour this is the place to go
4
Located on Clarke Quay. Large inside in a German style with outdoor area that is covered
Good choice of German food and beers
Quantities are small but food is good

HiI visited there on Aug 15 with a vegetarian friend. While there were veggie choices, he ordered a cheese spatzle which was less on salt and the cheese was runny. Not tasty enough. I dont know though if that is the original German recipe. I ordered pork ribs with sauerkraut and potatoes and gravy. Everything was good but the pork was not cooked well. The meat needs to fall off the bone when we use cutlery but i had to jostle. Otherwise my dish was good but again a bit low on salt.On service front - i felt the server was not attentive. They were concerned till we had ordered. after that another lady came to serve food and that is it. They actually took away the candle from our table. Only when i asked for it did she keep it back saying it wud eat away space when serving food. What they should do, just when the food is being brought in, and i can see the volume, i should be asked if the candle stand can be removed
3
I suppose the intention was to make it like a German beer hall (it is paulaner after all). However the band was during up early (around 9) giving it more of a club vibe. Maybe because it was a Saturday but it was difficult to talk or enjoy the meal. Great selection of German beer on tap though with efficient staff who were very accomadating with our children 
4
Decent German lager on draft. Prices are not half bad for the quality your getting, you get what you pay for remember!!Nice area to sit outside and relax into the evening.Yes, of course there are better places to go but this does exactly what is says on the tin
3
The service staff are very attentive and the waiting time for the food to be served was satisfactory. But the quality of food was not as expected. Though I feel that the food served at Paulaner at Millenia Walk was much better. The Buffalo Wings served with BBQ sauce we ordered were deep fried but the meat was very dry. The rest of the food that we ordered which was their signature Pork Knuckle and Sausage Platter were alright.
2
Want that Paulaner keep looking. The is good. Very disappointing food and service. Prices are high due to location. The only food that was marginally good was the pretzel ... and do you ever get butter in Germany ? No you get mustard by default. Which here you have to ask for Oh well.....I will not return
4
Atomesohere is great due to live band. I like their Live band's singer is good. Actress is busy with collect the menu but forgot to send beer to us or send wrongly beer to us. Can leave at least 1 menu for customer to compare their orders. I think will visit again but hope can improve their service skills.
3
Me and my friends decided to head to paulaner for some drinks after dinner. There was a live band there and hence we couldn't really talk. The dessert there was a disappointment and the price wasn't justifiable. Could have been better.
5
Everything about this restaurant was excellent. The food quality was great. The service was friendly and fast. The prices were fair. We sat outside and enjoyed the music. Loved the place!
4
Went on a weekday. Very quiet. Food is nice and the portion just right. Live music only on Wednesday and Saturday.
3
Bored band. No excitement. Went here during Christmas Eve but didn't have Christmas feel. Food is average but price slightly expensive.
5
Went out with friends. Amazing varieties of starters and the place is really very pleasant. Amazing dinner experience.
1
The worst German food so far I haven eaten outside of Germany. The salmon was salty, the pork loin looked like a Schnitzel but was tasteless and the slowly braised beef loin (Schmorbraten) looked like food from the can and was uneatable. The beers of course were ok. The prices are acceptable for a restaurant at Clarke Quay
5
Great place. The band sometimes changes but overall is good. Drinks are ok, certainly when using the Entertainer app (buy one get one free deals). Celebrated birthday party of a friend and had a lot of fun. You can request songs as well and they do birthday special on stage
5
This is my 3rd date to visit Paulaner and this Place never Fails us. we love the food So much. They provide Great service, Good food recommendation and most all they will Rock you on their stage. the most entertaining live Band i've ever seen that you will love to listen and hung on until to last set. recommended! i love this place. I love There DJ too. Cool
3
I like the Paulaner Brauhauses. It is a good place to have a decent german beer. Difficult to admit as Belgian, but ok. The service is good, quite quick. It's open late and has a good terrace inside the Clarkes quay complex in Singapore. The prices are ok, certainly compared to the Singaporean level. They have some good tapas and fingerfood. The pizzas were very nice also. Certainly a place to go back
4
Popped in here for my dinner and the staff were very good , fast service getting a beer to me in a couple of mins .I went for the 5 mixed sausages with came with small mashed potato pot and sour kraut and a selection of mustards .All was great and I had apple pie in a beer batter with ice cream and Folks this is a must superb .Well done to the tran a great place to go and the other customers looked to be having a great time
4
Staffs are friendly and patient in explaining the Groupon t&c. Though there are little discrepancy in different staff's explanation, probably just need to make sure everyone telling the right t&c in the future.
Food was nice, drinks were good.
4
A good place to have an evening out with friends. Good food, even better beer. Had a great time. Will definitely return.
3
It is a german bar in Clarke Quay Singapore. The place has live music, they play on request as well. You can get german beers and breads here. I found the service to be slow on a saturday night.
5
Food is great! Beer is great! My only gripe? The band was a little too noisy. We could hardly hear ourselves after they started playing. But they were good.
2
First of all, the blame is all on me.. I didn't carefully read the fine print!We booked a Groupon Deal for the Paulaner in Clarke Quay. Pay S$30 and get S$60 (per person) and for weekends add S$10. We booked the weekend version, so paid S$80 for total value of S$120, to make things even better, Paulaner would also throw in 2 glasses of the House Pour! Perfect we thought. That is until the bill came, as a matter of fact, two bills came! Th efirst was to show we had consumed S$ 75 for food and an additional bill of S$ 60 for beer!!?? Told the waiter that it was a mistake as I was using the voucher. She said I dont know that much about the deal, so she asked her manager to come. And of course, the voucher was only valid for food (excluding beef and veal) and only for selected SOFT drinks. I was amazed about my own stupidity and of the misleading advert of Groupon/Paulaner. I asked the manager why they didn't inform us after ordering beer etc, but that is not their duty! The guest is supposed to know what he is buying...True again. So I repeat, my own mistake and stupidity!My main concern here, also the reason for naming this review "don't get fooled" is the way the deal is advertised.The picture on the back ground shows lots of juicy looking meat and BEERS! Paulaner is a brewery right?? Then the wording of the main advert is "for food and drinks" and in the same sentence it is mentioned you are getting a house poor beer of 300ml each! That combined with the fabulous picture in the advert would make people think this is the deal, well at least it made us think so!If you can click the "additional" information it says in the looong fine print the deal is only for pork, no beef and veal, and excludes alcohol..So I repeat myself, my bad my mistake, but boy is the advertising misleading! In addition I think it would be client friendly too advise at the beginning the deal is without alcohol, especially when ordering a second or third glass!I've had enough of both Groupon and Paulaner for a while...

Food was good, and came in huge portion (had the pork knuckles). Was lucky yo be able to sit near the band performance. The staff can be more alert to us as we are situated at a corner. Other stuff quite ok. Can see that the drinks that are a tad higher
3
We wanted a light bite and a beer so chose this German themed restaurant. Well the drinks menu was expensive even by Singapore standards so we chose a couple of still pricey soft drinks. We ordered a club sandwich and a warm vegetable salad. Even though they were not busy it took a while before the food arrived and then the dishes were 10 minutes apart. We gained a distinct impression that they were spinning things out to increase the drinks order - this was while adjacent restaurants were running happy hours including two for one offers. The saving grace was that the food was okay. Unless money is no object then you will be better off elsewhere
1
Meet and greet friendly. Took us to a table. A few minutes later came and moved us onto a different table because a big group were about to arrive. Luckily it was happy hour so ordered my choice of a tap beer. Got told it wasn't a happy hour beer contrary to signage outside. Had a standard beer instead. Got served a very small beer for a large number of dollars.Ordered a bretzel. Got delivered a small and pasty offering that didn't taste of much again at top dollar.These guys are trading on the name of Paulaner and letting down the brand - which I know well - very badly
1
Went to enjoy a beer and to get an Oktoberfest atmosphere at the Paulaner Suntec in Singapore.They offer only one type of beer no other choice at $17++= $19 for a small and $34.50++= $41 for a large!!!Ridiculous expensive and awful customer treatment to force your customers to drink one type of beer that they would have bought cheap from Germany.Load disco music and cold food. That was that Oktoberfest feeling that Paulander in Singapore could give you.- NEVER AGAIN!!Paulaner you aught to be ashamed of yourself
4
Tried Paulaner beer for the first time. It was just perfect. Smooth. Chilled. Felt like crushed ice is mixed in it. It was amazing and we had total fun.We tried signature Paulaner and then Sampler of 5. I liked the Original Munich Lager and Hefe Weissbier far better than the other darker ones.Crowd was awesome. Ambience good. Music appreciable. After some time, DJ was taken over by live band
4
friendly service. bavarian food so so. beer average. only customer when we went around 7pm on a Thursday. Regretted getting the day's promotion set because happy hour prices are cheaper when bought separately.
3
It's a nice brewery and offers a good selection of food and drink options.
It is comparatively cheaper than most of the other pubs in the area.
3
Nice place in Clarke Quay, visit during happy hour is worth, I can't say whether it's a truly German experience or not but one can quench their thirst for German beer
4
Excellent service staff, very polite and friendly and efficient! Friday band was awesome! Not too noisy and you can have good conversations with your friends and still enjoy the music. The Friday band's repertoire was appropriate and EVERY song was nicely delivered with the right feel. A bar I would revisit alone just to enjoy the music
5
Situated in the heart of Clarke Quay, this is the perfect bar for affectionados of German lager. The area has vibrant bars and restaurants all around it so the atmosphere is fantastic. I sat outside and had a few beers accompanied with some ribs to eat. They also do the usual bratwurst if you want to go the whole hog. I thought the prices were quite reasonable given the location and contributed to a very pleasant evening indeed.
2
Drinks are typically like what you can find at all the other bars and restaurants in Clarke Quay. Services rendered by some staff was alright but one was totally rude with dis regards with the comfort of the customers. Please don't bother to bring any important guests as you definately do not wished to be embrassed or leave a bad impression on your guests. Yes. Skip this joint.Never had any serious issues with the other places in that area. In fact, it is so competitive that other bars are going all out to win customers with their best service attitude
3
I went in search of this place specifically for the wheat beers. I've had refreshing experiences on earlier occasions elsewhere. But was kind of disappointed, the brews didn't seem fresh. We were sitting outside, so I don't know if it was from the tap, or it was bottled beer. Kinda pricey, but that was expected since its Clarke Quay, everything is expensive here. Guess it's better to sit inside also, it's very noisy outside, even on weekdays. Think I'll give it a miss next time, maybe try their other Brauhaus in Singapore, next time.
3
We went with a crowd of 4 to the Paulaner. When we sat down all other tables have been vacant, because we came around 6.30 pmThe waiter was not really familiar with the menue and it was already difficult to get a starter ordered. We had couple of chilled beers and at the end some pork knuckles. The taste was amazing, but the service level spoiled that. The name sells and it's a popular location. Should improve on the service then it would be perfect
5
A enthralling live band, excellent atmosphere to charge you up for an amazing weekend evening within Clarke Quay. Oktoberfest was on and the central plaza had amazing performance by various city bands. Dad Paulaners Weiss Beer with some savory snacks and sides to go. The band kept the moods up.A nice place to be on weekends
2
Steak is definitely low quality; Service is low level (no napkin before i asked, nobody saw i had no fork and nobody told me that what I ordered was not available - baked potato - and served me different things.Definitely to avoid .... Maybe just for a beer in Clark quay and some finger food
4
The food is great and the price is reasonable. We were there last Saturday night and they had happy hour for house pours and 300ml beers for 50% off before 10:30pm. The service is average.
1
Conveniently located within the bustling Clarke Bay area, this Paulaner restaurant offered unfortunately lower quality if food compared to the standard of other Paulaner restaurants in Asia with higher price.
2
Love Paulaner beer but enough is enough $21 a beer for average service and a DJ playing music when everyone is watching the football. It just too expensive with so many other options which is disappointing
4
Micro brewery with various beer options. Food was also good. Only disadvantage was wash rooms were not very conveniently placed. One had to use a lift and go to third floor which was an annoyance.
3
it is a nice place for partying or eating specially on the weekend, music and groups of people everywhere
5
At first, I wandered around in Clarke Quay to find some cheap drinks and finally found this awesome place with really economic price compared to another bar or cafe around in happy hours time. This bar offers 50% discount of their selected drinks (from 14 SGD to 7 SGD) and it's a way cheaper than most offering which cost you more than 10 SGD for decent beers. For the taste, you know that the Bavarian beers have their own unique taste compared to another beers. You should choose this one in happy hour

So 5 of us walked along the river then our German host saw this sign and we were whisked into this seating area. Service was pleasant, responsive and brisk. Pork Knuckles were really crispy on outside, done to perfection inside. Gravy was good too. Our host regaled us with stories of his memories of saurkraut in his grandmothers basement, in a time when there were no vegetables in winter, and pronounced these excellent.The Nurnberger sausages were also as "close to home" as he's had outside Germany. I loved the pretzels the most, perfect. Went down well the the dark beer.Other than a truly riverside location and aircon, I couldn't have asked for more in a hot night in Singapore
1
Ordered a pork knuckle, which took over 40 minutes. A waiter came 20 minutes after ordering to confirm my order, so I susspect they lost/forgot the order. Finally when the pork knuckle arrived, the skin was rock hard, and the meat was completly dry. It was also half a knuckle even though I ordered whole.When trying to get staff attention to complain, they finally said I dont have to pay for the main ( I didnt want to wait for another main), but they did not want to refund the 2 small beers I had, even though I did not finish my 2nd drink with the main.Also ordered a pretzel for entree which was quite average, and it did not have any salt.Very poor food, and unhappy with the service. Keep away
3
Normally has good reviews locally , but I was a little disappointed.Fresh spring rolls were full of lettuce and only has the tiniest sliver of prawn in them.Vietnamese fish was much better , extremely tasty a nd cooked perfectly.Try to get a table right by the water , it is worth the wait 
4
After seeing the menu we decided to head back for dinner like most places in Clarke Quay it doesnt open til 6pm. We had bretzals follwed by pork knuckle and roast chicken. All the food was lovely and came out quickly, portions are a good size so come hungry. We were served quickly and drinks came quickly as well. Happy hour is 50% off til 10pm on beer and a few other drinks other prices seem reasonable for the area. We would happily go back for food or just a drink
4
It is one of my favourite place for relaxing my day in mid of my business trips to Singapore. Cool beers, tasty finger foods, and good friends for sure!!
5
Go here for a great happy hour. The band was amazing and they were so nice to us! Will go back again in Singapore!
1
Staff were either inexperienced or unable to cope. We had to request for our orders multiple times. We gave up on them and picked up the beers from the bar ourselves. Will never come back here again. Food is average and overpriced.
2
The food and drinks were overpriced for what you got. There are better option for food around the place. I think it mostly survives on unsuspecting tourists.
2
Attracted by the nice atmosphere and the beautiful pics on the menue we wanted to try it out. But as Germans we were really disappointed. What they call a Rostbraten is what we would call " a shoe's sole". If this piece of meet had 100 g I was lucky. And that for $26.00The Spaetzle where to dry and had a fishy taste. The Wiener Schnitzel with Bratkartoffel (pan fried cooked potato slices) hat a terrible taste of old oil. The digs for my daughter came wrong. The waiter didn't want to note the number of the dish so he brought out the wrong meal. Had to wait again.The staff was very friendly. I prefer Brotzeit. Bigger portions. Better quality and taste.
2
I know this is a tourist trap, but what we were served was a disgrace to German food. A Chef salad that consisted almost only of greens with a few grams of ham&cheese, 3/4 of a hardboiled, tiny egg and some alibi tomatoes, 2 slices of cucumber and some onion. A spoonful of dressing, so we had to order more immediately. The Fresh Garden Salad was equally disappointing. Even more outraging were the spinach noodles, which were served on a sizzling plate. Drowned in oil and absolutely no taste whatsoever. We were almost happy that the size of the portion was so small. But it gets more upsetting if you think about the SGD 18 price tag. The only glimpse of hope were the sausages although they couldn't save the day for us anymore. On the up, their beer is good and the service was also acceptable and quick. The place is nice with outdoor seating right in Clarke Quay. However, we will never return here for the food again. I guess Brotzeit is still the benchmark when it comes to German fare in Singapore. A lot of catching up to do, Paulaner
4
Paulaner’s a great place to head when looking for a casual night. It’s very German, with long tables and freshly tapped Paulaner beer giving it a great beer fest theme. They do an Oktoberfest event which is always busy and lots of fun and we often find ourselves in there, having a few beers before heading out to Clark Quay
3
Had to wait 15mins before the server realised I hadnt had my order taken. Had to wait another 40 mins before my pint of beer arrived. I feel that they actually need more staff in order to attend to guests. The only reason I stayed longer was for the band, Great choice of songs, Top 40's, a little retro and a whole lot of EDM to dance to. Kudos Nation One!
5
After a long week of hard work (at the shipyard) we treated ourselves for a good dinner.We were here before just for the German beers and the knocked pig bone.This time we couldn’t decide so we asked for the recommendation, it was the 20 oz veal steak with a bottle of red wine to finish this gorgeous piece of meat, for sure a A-status
5
Staff are all super friendly and hardworking! Recognises you each time. Special mention to JR, Sai and Elmar.Great band :) pretty Raz, Sunny who raps well. Dj Shaty is the best dj ever...hidden gem!my friends and I are hooked. See you guys tmr! :
