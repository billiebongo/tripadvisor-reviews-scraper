Hidden away behind the tourist eateries at Robinson quay this is not easy to find. But it's worth looking for. High quality, fast, comfortable and very tasty food. I only wish I'd found it earlier. A must if you like good Japanese food.

This is the best "Mochi Nabe" in singapore, especially the Shouyu base soup together with the cabbage and enoki, it taste so fantastic. Other then the Nabe, we had small fried shrimp, tomatoes and tako wasabi as the starter, taste fabulous. Will come back again for dinner very soon.

I ate here last year and it was great. Same again this year. Excellent ramen, good service and reasonably priced for this area. It's hidden away and you don't get a view of the river but why not eat here and grab a drink by the river instead.

We want to have dinner on a Saturday night. The place was not crowded at first as it was early, but became quite full by the time we left. Family friendly with attentive staff. The food was average. Nothing to get excited about, just acceptable for that pricing. We had the motsunabe with shio (salt) soup. The soup was way too salty....would have been better if the taste was lighter so that we could enjoy the soup as well. However, the motsu and the vegetables in the pot tasted good, probably the best you can get in Singapore at the moment.

New to Singapore, I wasn't expecting much when my husband told me he wanted to eat here the other night. We stepped in and I ordered a tasty noodle dish (pork and fish traditional) and my husband ordered the light soy ramen soup. By far one of my favorite dishes I've come across! Even our two-year-old ate the noodles and she is a very picky eater

I visited Goku with a group of Japanese colleagues. According to them the menu is faithful to Japanese taste.The menu is extensive and we had several starters. In fact you could do the entire meal with the starters.We followed with a hot pot. All dishes were tasty and good portions.There is also a big selection of sake and soju to try.Certainly worth the visit to this relaxed restaurant for a Japanese taste

Cozy izakaya style restaurant featuring motsunabe. It is quite difficult to find an authentic motsunabe and finger foods restaurant in Singapore at such prices. We were here on a weekday night and the restaurant was not too crowded. Cozy enough to drop by for a quick drink and bite to end off the day.Absolutely loved the onsen tamago in the oden dish
