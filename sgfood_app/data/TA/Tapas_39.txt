Friendly staff, very nice atmosphere, plenty of great tapas to choose from and all impressively good. Don't miss the octopus and the black rice.
Good selection of wines and beverage. Not to be missed.

I enjoyed a superb dining experience at this restaurant last night. Exec Chef Rodrigo and his teams attention to detail was spectacular. We tried 7 of their dishes and very much enjoyed the flavour combinations of each. Highly recommend this venue, the Americano cocktails and Grilled Black Angus were personal favourites.Thanks for a great evening

This place is nice. Not as pricy as some of those restaurants around and the food is good - a little different from all the places around. It is not quite spanish food, more just tapas style - ie very small portions. Even the pasta. Service was EXCELLENT - I had come in a bad mood but they were so attentive that one just had to smile. would recommend to come again. The dishes we had : Champagne sea urchin - Cost a bit at $20 but it was great - creamy, smooth and strong alcohol aroma. Plating was a bit disappointing as it came in a bowl unlike the photos on the web. Pasta with sausage and mozzarella - very al dente pasta and a bit spicy. The flavours did it. Pickled vegetables and anchovies - too much pickled vegetables and too little anchovies and mozzarella. So didn't like it. Scallop crevice - different because they chopped the scallops into squares and soaked in this citrus spicy sauce with onions. The onions over powered the scallops which had a nice texture. Bambu clams and artichoke salad- sure doesn't look like a salad but that's probably why it is good. The artichoke was so GOOD and paired with the clams - it was amazing. Tuna tataki and avocado - once again under the salad heading but not much salad. Not what I expected but it was good. They had a spicy, nutty shell that surrounded the tuna. Avocado smoothie - to die for!! This place is a pub but we didn't feel like drinking. Didn't feel out of place at all and thy hey have a lot of non-alcoholic drinks.

Slumdog millionaire- don't have star bucks but want that experience. Don't we all. Duxton hill conquered. 3 stories of class. Because turn up is for boys & girls. This place is for the elite. Mark- the magician behind the bar. I was taken to Club 39 by my buddy, offered to try their signature cocktail by the same name. 27 years of tasting different alcoholic beverages....I Finally found THE Elixir! On the first night, fresh gourmet bread hot from the oven, filling the air with its aroma served on a platter with truffle butter! Watermelon Carpaccio!! Came in next. More 39'ers. Sliders with Angus. More 39'ers. More people. Laughter. Introductions. Inventors. Models. Millionaires. Engineers. Teachers.Entrepreneurs. Surgeons. The demographics is global. Afro-American, Indonesian-French, Indian-Singaporean, French-Belgian. Wow. It's a party. It's a league. 12 day vacation. 8 times at the Club. Some after the days planned events. Because who doesn't want amazing food. Amazing cocktails. Amazing people. Amazing ambience. Amazing service. Feel like a VIP. Kelly, Dani, Mark, Bobby: Thank you. If I come back to Singapore, one of the reasons would be Club 39.If u are one of those who have a bucket list to places u visit, make sure this is in the top 3
