Love the non-fried dishes at Panko although the restaurant is supposedly a fried food joint. Evan the manager was really friendly and offered free cocktails when he knew that we were celebrating my friend's birthday.

Food was ok, service was good
Restaurant was pretty empty
The yuzu beer was good
Mekajiki sashimi was fresh

First time at this place, food was awesome. Definitely worth a second visit. The service was good too.

The lunch sets here really are decent and there never seems to be a problem getting a table on weekdays (haven't tried on weekends). Friendly service with good food, hard to ask for more than that. I'm sure I'll be back for more.

A great find amidst a predominantly middle eastern precinct. The restaurant was pack and well patronized by Japanese. That was testimony to its authenticity. The one-for-one offer was a delight and great value. Delicious meal and service

Set price lunch is astoundingly good value. Easy and relaxed. Great service and food.
Terrific place in the area.

panko is super cool n trendy little japanese spot. tried it out because it was on chope and the entertainer app. home girl likes to save some monies, even when the guy's payin. i like eating healthy so it was kind of a turn off that most of the food was deep fried... but the resto is called panko so i should've known better haha

Although the restaurant was a little dark and noisy, it was a good set menu that offered a variety of good quality special kushikatsu options, which turned out to be really delish! The mini bara chirashi was really pretty tiny a portion, but overall the meal was enjoyable

Kushikatsu is meant to be eaten with dipping sauce, but they donâ€™t serve that. Instead you get miso paste. The Chirashi don was a huge let down - rice was absolutely tasteless with not even a hint of vinegar. Will recommend other places to get your kushikatsu fix.

With Chope promo 1-for-1 set dinner, we decided to go Panko and gave a try. A relax ambience restaurant. Good for casual gathering and have a beer over dinner. Overall, the food was good. For 4 pax, the dinner cost $180 (inclusive of a bucket of beer). If without the promo, I will find it overpriced. I will consider going back again, only with the *promotion

The 1 for 1 set consisted of all manner of deep fried food. Simple, good, tasty. Though the environment was a tad too noisy.

We were their with toddlers and they were so nice to give us a private room. Food and service was amazing. The wooden carved doors from Japan are so pretty :)

We went here for Xmas lunch and tried 3 different lunch sets. All tasted awesome and the portion was a good serve. Well recommended.
4
The set lunch is value for money and food is nice. Servers are polite and the service is prompt. Will visit again.
3
Counter local staff were too friendly by talking unstopped . The manager and the Jap Chef are polite and humble.
4
The lunch sets here are really hard to beat. Good selection and decent quality food. My chirashi set was really tasty as were the various sides. Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly. Need to return here for sure.

Its my second visit, think it is a great hideout for dinner and drinks after a shopping day with my girls! Honestly it will be great if they can improve on their chairs, without cushion flat wooden chair is extremely uncomfortable for long hours seating.Ladies who is trying out sake for the first time, you could check out their sparkling sake. Slightly sweeter and great match for their food. My friend even commented it taste like moscato, and she loves it! HahaService is great, look forward to their new sake to be introduced into their menu!

Had the chope 1 for 1 dinner set menu, which included 6 skewers, 1 mini don, 2 appetisers and 1 dessert. The skewers were good, especially the asparagus and salmon ones. Service was attentive too - they refilled our water without us requesting for it. They also allowed me to change my chirashi don to oyako don. Price wise, it was worth it with the chope deal, but i wouldn’t pay $58++ for one set menu. The light is also a little too red for my liking, but that is probably to evoke a pub feeling.
5
Had the chef's set menu and ordered some additional mains such as the dragonroll and fried bittergourd with pork. Everything was awesome (surprisingly the cold udon too) and we especially liked that the panko batter was well executed. HH bucket of 5 bottles of Jap beers of choice was great value as well
4
Ambience: feels a tad like you’re in a futuristic Tokyo with that bladerunner vibe.Food: relatively small serving of chirashi don but enough to accommodate other portions of the set lunch. The kushikatsu that came with that was a nice accompaniment in addition to the velvety-smooth, seafoody chawanmushi and equally umami miso soup.
