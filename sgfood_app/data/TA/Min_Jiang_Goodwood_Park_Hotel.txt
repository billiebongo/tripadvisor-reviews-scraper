Nice relaxing ambience to sit and dine by the pool. Area is sheltered hence no worries about rain. Service is prompt, food portions are reasonable.

My host ordered one of weekend set lunch menu which was a real treat! The most memorable for me was the salted egg yolk prawns. It was most exquisite. The ambiance was what you can expect from Goodwood Park Hotel and the service impeccable.
5
I must say I had one of the best Chinese dinners in Singapore
The restaurant is classy but not that different from many others, what makes the difference is quality
Shark fins soup, Peking duck, mango dessert... all delicious
Will definitely come back

One of the best Chinese places that we visited during our business trip. The restaurant is packed with regulars. We wanted a taste of authentic Chinese and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what we got. Both the chicken and the vegetarian dishes were perfect. The service was very good and we got the orders at a regular pace.
5
Joined for a wedding reception; they served suckling pig and Peking duck and it was absolutely sublime. The service was swift and the was executed very well. Every dish was quality and cooked perfectly. Would have no issues in recommending this place and would highly advise trying it out. Looking at the menu, its not cheap, but your going to be happy with what you have paid for
4
On my frequent visit to Singapore, I have always make a duty to have a meal at Min Jiang.Great atmosphere, very good authentic food.The Peking Duck is a must.I will be returning to Singapore and I have made a booking already for dinner.This is a restaurant that bookings is essential.Enjoy
5
The service at Min Jiang is undeniably awesome! Friendly, warm, attentive hospitality constantly displayed throughout our 2 hours of lunch, up from the managerial level to the front line hospitality team. And don't get me started with the durian dessert...I can talk about its beautiful taste and wonderful texture all day long! The dim sums, too, were doing a great job in pampering our palate and satisfying our tummies :)Thank You so much for this excellent experience that gave so much joy and comfort to me and my friends
5
I ate lunch at this restaurant at the Goodwood Park Hotel while in Singapore during two stays on a recent trip to Europe. Fantastic quality, and the prices per pot were very good. Service was excellent and I didn't have to wait long to be served. I'd definitely go back
4
I have found the food to be consistently of high quality. Plenty of options for the family - both vegetarian and otherwise. Their beef cubes are out of the world as are nearly all their vegetable dishes. Good service - but all this comes for price. Very expensive. Dont be surprised to get a bill of S$ 200 for a family of 2 adults and 2 young kids with an average appetite
4
Came here for dinner and had the dinner set - the duck starter very nice; everyone liked the bee hoon noodles. Have to admit the rest of the food was forgettable. Set had too much food. Shark fins soup so when one asks for a swap, the soup wasn't that good. Noisy for the price point
5
You can rely on the consistent quality of food and service. An outstanding place to take guests. Highly recommend the restaurant. Accessible for wheelchair if you enter from the 'back' car park
5
Our host took us for lunch to this restaurant within the hotel, Every aspect of the visit was 1st class, the service, quality of the food and regular top ups of tea.
A real treat.
4
My overseas friends enjoyed the food very much. Much neglected great restaurant. Try the smoked duck and Mongolian Chicken. üëç
4
One of the best for Kung Pao Chicken, String beans with chicken, Xiao Long Pao, smoked duck, and many others! A Favourite for Singaporeans for a Long time. Book early or you will not get a table!

...but the customers can be really annoying. The service is all it can be under those circumstances.

Min Jiang came as a recommendation from friends who used to live in Singapore. We couldn't be happier that we sought suggestions because the restaurant was wonderful. Arrival was a bit shaky as there was no one at the reception when we arrived. We had to wait for I'd say about 2-3 minutes before someone came to usher us in. The wait staff was incredibly polite and friendly. One of the diner in our party was allergic to shellfish and nuts. They have an incredible personable attention to his needs, including the chef someone out to ensure us that their food was prepared separately with zero cross contamination. What a lovely and reassuring gesture. The erstwhile black pepper crab was every bit to its renown. Succulent and fresh and indeed just the right spicy. We without a doubt prefer black pepper over red chilli crab. Latter we find too sweet. Beside the crab we ordered fish, chicken and shrimp appetisers and entrees. The Sichuan and Cantonese cuisines were delectable at fine restaurant, every morsel fresh and delicately presented. We strongly recommend this award winning restaurant which is an outstanding choice for fine dining choose or any occasion.
5
It exceeded my general experience with Chinese restaurants. My favourite dish was the shrimp cooked in wine. The shrimps were very fresh, big, and crispy. They were cooked in wine prepared with the Chinese ingredient 'dongui' and herbs. The taste was phenomenal, I even drank the broth that came with it. Other dishes such as the beef spareribs, lemon chicken, and braised tofu were all above standard. I highly recommend this restaurant
5
We decided to eat in the hotel due to being tired, what a good decision it proved to be. The food was excellent with the Peking duck an absolute highlight. Service was extremely efficient and friendly and we received great recommendations on what and how much to order. Well worth a visi
4
Been to this restaurant before and loved it - best Peking Duck! Great ambience but sadly this time we were served by a trainee. No towels at the start or finish of dinner and it took an age for her to make up the pancakes so cool to cold and not well wrapped so tended to fall to pieces as we tried to eat them. We realise that staff do need training but would prefer it wasn't when we have come from Australia and booked a table well in advance. The flavour was still delicious and the lychee desert was a world beater - a fresh gourmet delight.
4
The food is good, especially their Crispy Duck smoked in Camphor Tea and Steamed rice with preserved Chinese sausages wrapped in lotus leaf. Went on a weekday evening and it was crowded. There were still many guests coming in after 9:30pm and the alfresco area was quite packed. Will return to dine at this place.Room for improvements:The flooring is sometimes quite distracting as when someone walks past, you can feel their movement, plus small walkways. In addition the serving time of the food is not well coordinated as some dishes took quite a long while to come, so some dish that were on our table became cold... In addition, the service have plenty of room for improvements. It was difficult to get hold of a staff, probably understaffed, so we ended up taking things for ourselves as we gave up waiting
5
The Ming Jiang is one of the top choices if you are looking for great chinese food. One of the highlights is definetley the hot and sour soup and one of the best you can get in Singapore.
5
I was there on Christmas Eve and had the set dinner. The food was simply delicious. Each item complimented each other very well.
5
We Went with high expectations and also informed our friends for whom it was first time. Fantastic Food. Higher than expected taste. Very good service also just make sure you are good two hours plus away from closing time and every thing will be hunky dory. Main selection was Vegetarian and each dish was better than the other. We loved Crispy rice with Hot and Sour Soup but then also loved Onion pan cake so much that we ordered next portion. Mock chicken with black bean sauce was amazing so much so that my wife wanted to know the supplier to them. Should not miss their Tofu and also Peking Duck - all vegetarian. Truly five stars. Go with high expectations I am sure you will love it too. PS: please do indicate you need food without Ajino Moto.
5
The set up is in a beautiful colonial hotel, restaurant is half inside and half al fresco. The outdoor part is way nicer for a brunch. Service was spot on, and the waitress was kind enough to remind me which dishes might include meat after we explained to her I am pescatarian (this is not usually the case in Singapore I realise so usually one has to ask for every single dish). Food was really good, authentic, fresh, super tasty, yet not indulged on condiment or salt. Highly recommend

We had just arrived back from our four day cruise and wanted to have good Chinese lunch before catching our flight back to Dubai. My wife and I were staying close to this lovely hotel so chose Min Jiang which was rated highly. So five of us agreed to meet at 1.30 pm directly at the restaurant. There is seating inside and outside ( facing the swimming pool ). However we chose to be indoors. We ordered quickly from the menu as their last orders were at 2 pm. I was impressed that the server who took our order didn't have to write down any of our choices ! She must have an amazing memory. She got it all right of course. The food started arriving without a long wait and I must say that everything tasted wonderful. Our friends were also pleased and it turned out to be a lovely afternoon, well spent. After lunch we sat outside for an hour, enjoying the relatively pleasant temperature and green surroundings. Would happily go back again
5
This place is not cheap but you get what you pay for. Perhaps the best Chinese food we've ever had. Very fresh seafood and vegetables. The prawn and pork fried rice was excellent. Had the mango dessert and it was enjoyable. You can dine inside with AC or outside by the pool like we di
3
Cards on the table, I really like the food here - their Lobster Szechuan hot pot rocks and we've had very few bad dishes across a wide range of options over the years but.... it's always been pricey and now it's getting silly - the lobster dish we love used to be charged at a fixed rate for small medium or large but now it's per 100g and unless you're careful, your waitress will decide how much you need - Sgd135 of lobster later..... the wine list is decent but at the higher end price wise for Singapore and sadly the service tonight was pretty sloppy, not bringing dishes together, trying to clear tables when we're not finished, trying to serve wine but not watching when we're empty (would much rather a bucket on the table and we serve ourselves!!)... still like the atmos of the outside tables and will go again but Imperial Treasure in Paragon is better value for money...
5
Min Jiang came to me very highly recommended and it did not disappoint on any aspect. This is authentic Asian dining at its best.Seating is available inside or out which is always a choice I appreciate and we were seated straight away even with the restaurant close to capacity.The Xiao Long Bao are some of the finest I have had anywhere in Asia. We ordered a selection of main dishes to share and all were excellent.

Min Jiang Restaurant has been around since 1982. I can still recall the time when they had their outlet across the road where the Spa is now situated. In those days, we enjoyed their selection of Sichuan and Cantonese dishes, particularly their Chicken diced with Dried Chilies; Long beans with minced meat; their Mango pudding and Pancake dessert; etc. We returned to dine at this restaurant and I was surprised to see that they‚Äôve moved into the Goodwood Park Hotel. The entrance is small and unimpressive, dining tables lined in a long tight row inside, but in a more spacious arrangement outside at the verandah next to the Hotel‚Äôs main swimming pool. The outdoor space is cooled by ceiling fans, whilst inside, it‚Äôs air conditioned. There are six private dining rooms.Service was initially attentive and polite, although several times when I wanted some attention, I found no waitresses visible, possibly they were busy serving elsewhere. We ordered the famed Peking Duck done in two styles; the Ham and Melon soup; The Marble Goby; the Abalone with Tofu; and the Noodles with Lobster. The first dish to come was the complimentary birthday buns. Small, but adequate in size so as not to fill you up. The Peking Duck was served all wrapped neatly in wheat wraps. This was tasty especially with the plum sauce, and with the spring onion shoots giving it a crunch. The Ham and Melon soup was delicious with a hint of stock aroma. The Goby fish had a meat that was sweet and slightly crunchy, but it also had lots of bones; the Abalone with Tofu was disappointing as the abalone meat ( a sliced piece ) was tough and the tofu unremarkable. When the Duck returned, the meat was minced and fried. This was to be placed on and eaten with lettuce leaves. We found the meat too dry and saltish. The Noodles and Lobster was just alright, meaning there was no Wow! factor. Served with a well-flavoured stock, a small portion of noodles and perhaps two to three mouths full of lobster meat. Average cost per person for this meal without wine was $70.00. It‚Äôs certainly not cheap to dine here as almost every item is chargeable as ‚Äòper portion‚Äô. Consider the Marble Goby, served about 100 grams in a small cup costing $20.00 per cup; or the Noodles with Lobster (actually half a small lobster) at $26.00 a portion. Neither of the above two ‚Äòportions‚Äô will fill you up. We brought a magnum bottle of red wine and there was no corkage charge. Being inside a five star hotel, I suppose the charges need to be classy as well, but their standards I feel, need some catching up!

This restaurant offers one of the best Peking Duck in Singapore. The skin is very crisp and the meat they serve afterwards, the buns and crepes are very crisp. The food is always good and I have been there for many years and go back every time I visit Singapore. A lot of space and ideal with families and large parties
5
A great variety of Asian food all cooked to perfection with service to match. A warm Singapore night sitting outside by the pool a Gin and tonic and some sumptuous selections that tickle your taste buds. I'm sure you get the picture.
4
The food and service were great but despite all the other reviews the only disappointing thing was the Peking Duck!
5
Have a very good experience dining in the restaurant. The food is delicious and the service provided by the restaurant manager, Moon is very good.
Will definitely visit again.
5
Good food.. Try the peking duck, sharks fin soup with crabmeat, and the avocado cream with ice cream in whole coconut..
Friendly service by Ms Moon and Ms Beckie.. Good ambience..
4
Try a terrace lunch to escape from the Singaporean aggresive AirCon. Take care when ordering as the portions are large, rather just try two main dishes and their rice. If you are feeling extra hungry their house Singapore noodles are excellent.As with most upmarket hotels, neither food nor drinks are cheap by Western standards
5
I visited Min Jiang with my family last week and had a wonderful time. The peking duck was great and so were the other Sze Chuan dishes we tried. The service provided by Moon was attentive and made us feel very comfortable. She was very accommodating to our requests as well. We will definitely visit the restaurant again
5
I would like to express our amazing experience when I was served by Restaurant Manager, named Moon Ng on the 30th September. I was visiting this restaurant with my family. This was our first experience with this restaurant. Highly recommended Peking Duck, crisp and perfectly matched with traditional crepes. Moon has made us feel comfortable and welcomed during our time there. We had such a brilliant evening and I am really looking forward to being served by her again in the near future.
5
I went there with my family and we ordered few dishes,the dishes were very delicious especially the pecking duck. In the same time,we were served by the restaurant manager name "moon" if I'm not mistaken,she provided excellent services like we were having dinner in our own house. Thanks for the delicious food and great services

A classic case of arrogance setting in to what has been a good restaurant. Food remains good, but the service is possibly the worst I experienced anywhere in many years. The manager was particularly poor. We were at the restaurant to celebrate a 50th birthday. We specifically asked for a cake for the occasion at the start of the dinner. However, no cake arrived and when we asked the manager officiously told the whole group that the kitchen was closed. When we insisted, she checked and brought out a brownie that had been kept aside. At the end of the meal, she asked for cash saying 'card machine not working ah'. Again, we insisted on paying by card and sure enough she returned with the card chargeslip. Her manner was completely uncalled for and really put the whole group off. This is one restaurant we won't be coming back to
5
went there on 29th aug to have a small birthday celebration for my niece who just turned 15th. A charming and humerous lady, Moon attended to our table and recommeded their signature peking duck and shark's fin soup with bamboo pith. I must say that the soup is a not-to-missed when u come to this restaurant. Last but not least a big compliment to the durian pudding which will definitely suit durian lover's palate
5
staff accomodated our wish to dine outside - it was almost a private dining event.. food was very good, service excellent.. peking duck prepared nicely for us. ambience in the outside area great, i wouldnt like to dine inside though, looks a bit cramped.
5
The food is brilliant and the manager Moon Ng is very nice and full of humour. My girl friend and I are really enjoying the dinner!
4
Cosy and private dinner setting with a great set meal offering a high standard on the Chinese banquet 8 courses set menu. Friendly and diligent service staff
4
I didn't find this place a typical Chinese diner where it can be noisy. Nice dining experience where everyone can chat while enjoying the meal with no hearing issues. Nice food and accommodating staff.
4
I reckon eating on the terrace is the thing here; the inside's a bit pokey. The service is efficient if lacking in enthusiasm (when are Chinese serving staff ever joyful?)But the food...and we kept strictly to Szechuan...was practically beyond criticism. Incidentally, my Uber driver, AND the airport limo driver recommended it, so it's a popular favourite. Thus, a good idea to book, rather than just turn up
4
I had lunch with my family on a Monday, and was serve by a manager name Moon Ng. She has a very warm and friendly smile which makes us feeling very welcome in the restaurant. The food there is really delicious! Thank you Moon as well as Min Jiang
1
Went for Sunday Dim Sum to celebrate my Wife's birthday with a group of friends. Been before for dinner, and was always happy with the service and the food. However, today it was shockingly terrible. Rude staff, had to ask repeatedly for water and tea. Spilling the quail on the table - and leaving it there as if it was something we should accept - was really the last straw. It is both sad and disappointing for me to write this. I doubt we will ever go back again
5
We visit this restaurant often for both lunch and dinner and often bring guests. It never disappoints! The food is always consistently excellent as is the service. The peking duck is always a favorite as is the salt and pepper tofu. They do delicious dumplings as well. So many wonderful choices that it is hard to choose
5
We were recommended to this restaurant at the Goodwood Park Hotel - a beautiful old building full of old world charm. We were told that their duck-two ways was fabulous. Obviously frequented by many locals and we know why. It's centrally located in Scotts Road. Nothing disappointed , the ambience (very like the original Raffles), the fantastic service and wonderful fresh Chinese food. The menu is impressive and the cost is very reasonable. So we ordered the half duck and were in heaven. We had duck both with the peaking duck pancakes (crispy skin only) and the duck San Choy Bow - so delicious that we just had to have more duck! Duck again in pancakes but with the crispy skin with the lean meat attached - delicious. All washed down with an excellent Spanish white wine.Our waitress Wendy made the night- so professional yet so friendly and with a great personality. A wonderful evening all round - thank you Wendy and Min Jiang
5
Min Jiang is a superb Chinese restaurants that maintains its quality through out the years and also keep it authentic We tried the pekin duck, black pepper filet , tofu with crab sauce ( incredible ) eggplant Sichuan style , and spinach and mushrooms. For dessert we had the mango ago and pomelo dessert. If you ever crave Chinese go there or in London ! They also have a restaurant there.
4
We enjoyed a very nice lunch in this restaurant. We were very impressed by their vegetarian choices (there are some vegetarians in our group) and the non-veg food was great as well. Very friendly and helpfull staff.
4
Our party of 11 folks ordered dim sum for lunch.
Service was quick and not just because we came early (1145am), it continued throughout. The service associates were very responsive and helpful.
Good food, reasonably priced for a good location.
4
I have been to Min Jiang many times before and it has always met its high standards. The service was quite good, considering there was a busy lunch crowd. The dim sums were delightful. A bit on the expensive side.
4
Trolley cart service. Uniformly good quality of dim sum. The black pepper beef was excellent. Service was efficient. Repeat visit? Probably not, unless someone else was paying the bill!!
4
We invited my cousin and his wife for dinner. Staff is helpful and food is good. A little expensive but it is fine dining.
4
I stay at the Goodwood Park Hotel often. This is a nice cozy place in the main building. They have a vast selection on the menu with Dim Sums rolled in on a trolley. The food is absolutely mouth watering And the service excellent! A bit heavy on the price but a must visit place
3
We only went here because we were staying in the Goodwood Park hotel and some friends who live in Singapore said that some Chinese friends of theirs said that Min Jiang was the best Chinese in Singapore.Restaurant and staff were both very good, but we had a couple of issues. First the lighting was a spot light on our table, much too bright!The biggest let down was the food. We ordered a few different dishes. Whilst nothing was bad, it was nothing above the quality in a reasonable Chinese restaurant (and I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t mean the local suburban Cantonese), certainly not special or memorable. Perhaps my memories of much better meals in Beijing during a few recent trips where some locals and I went to a few restaurants all of which were certainly memorable for their excellent food, and at a much lower cost. The meal would be reasonable value at less than half the price
4
Another favourite for me, Min Jiang has some fantastic dishes. I love the onion pancakes, garlic asparagus and broccoli, black bean tofu and mango pudding. Highly recommend the place though it can be very busy at times so making a reservation is a good idea :
4
Went for a date night, sitting by the pool side outdoor adds to the romantic ambience.Staff are very friendly and accommodatingVegetarian menu available. The vegetarian food is good. About 10 options available. Peking duck and their curry is a must try! Besides that food is average. Need to add in more veg optionsCost needless to say, $$
5
Every dish was a masterpiece. Not a single item was lacking in flavour or quality. We tied a variety of dishes from around China including:Dongpo rouSalt and pepper prawnsMapo tofuRed grouper fishRoast DuckSelection of BBQ meatsEvery single dish hit the spot. Normally I would expect one or two average dishes at a banquet, but here everybody in our party of six agreed that every dish was of equal quality.For a high class Chinese meal in Singapore that gives value for money you can't really do any better than the Min Jiang.(The hotel itself is beautiful too and conveniently situated just off Orchard Road
3
Alacart Food was adequate, but menu was limited. Probably good for banquets
Shame the Dim Sum was closed due to the Luna Year celebrations.
4
Good food with great services. The staff not pushy on recommending Lunar New Year dishes which were offer during this festive period. On hearing our requirement - she suggested some dishes which turned out to be great especially the black pepper beef.
5
Not a budget choice but more flavours than I've ever tasted before, with helpful staff to discuss dishes and quantities. We ate on the terrace beside the pool.
4
Their dimsum cart offers quite a variety and all taste excellent, good service with attentive staff, good for quiet meetings and family dinners
4
The greeting, the space, the buzz, the vibe is all great when you enter. The table layout and the table set up is done really neatly..Coming to the food, just outstanding including the table placements. The dimsums, the beef in black pepper, whole Groupa..just cannot fault anything.I would have given a five but the service was just not attentive enough..It was like the servers were doing you a favour by serving you. Asked for the prawn dimsum at least five times before it actually arrived and there was a lack of understanding as well. Well a must visit for the foo
3
We ate here the night we arrived from Melbourne on our way home to UK as we didnt want the hassle of finding a restaurant on our first night. It was a nice evening so we asked to sit outside, unfortunately a large table of men decided to light up cigars next to us part way through our meal.Food was nice enough but nothing very memorable and they had very limited set meals if you werent sure what to order, unless you wanted a lot of seafood and abalone which I hate.Service was goodPrice was expensive compared with ohter restaurants we ate in whilst in Singapore
4
Really enjoyed a meal at this place last night - the venue is the attraction for me - sit outside near the pool to enjoy the cool breezes and good food. The dim sum is solid - not great - and the rest of the food is pretty good. The atmosphere is great outside and the food isn't overpriced (except for the wine - but so is everywhere in Singapore these days)... Service is attentive and solid - was a nice evening and would recommend the course menus for those on a business meal - otherwise too much food for a couple in spite of the urging of the employees...
4
This is a nice and authentic dim-sum restaurant. Now, I really cannot comment on the quality and taste of the food generally served because:1. We were a party of around 20 people and there was a fixed menu.2. I was the only vegetarian and had a separate spread for myself.That said, the food was very tasty, portions were decent and the service was excellent.Local friends from Singapore and Malaysia rated the food specialties very high, so I am happy to pass on this indirect recommendation
3
The food served here is like an old style dim sum venue you might find in HK. A lady goes round with a pushcart which is fairly cool and not something you see often. We had the classics like har gau and Cheung fun both were average at best. Easily edible but just not great. Tried the chow mien which was also nothing special. The venue is however fantastic! Google the hotel - it's special! We ate outside which is in the old hotel grounds next to the pool. There were a lot of fans on the go so you felt cool at all times so don't worry about melting away. So if you want outside dim sum (and done in a way you are not hot!) in a venue close to orchard road this is a place to consider. I wouldn't come again but glad I tried it once. Good for couples groups and also families - kids were able to run around freel
5
Really nice Chinese Cantonese style restaurant inside the Goodwood Park Hotel. Very busy with lots of large tables for parties in a very difficult shaped room, long and narrow, and you can be isolated at one end or very noisy if you get near the parties!However the service and the menu is outstanding, must surely be one of finest Chinese restaurants in town. Great duck, fish and various chinese choices. All presented in top class fashion by excellent professional and helpful staff.Good wine list and clearly a favourite with the locals entertaining their friends there.Really worth a visit
3
I like the push cart style which is hard to find in Singapore. The disadvantage of this style is some deep fried food may not be as fresh if turnover is a little slow. This place is worth a visit.
5
Every single item that we ordered was just perfect. And the service was attentive yet brilliantly discrete - just the way we like it. Keep it up!
Highly recommended!
5
This restaurant serves some of the best dim sum, but in the evenings the food is excellent. The maitre d' has good suggestions and the dishes are very good. Service can't be faulted. Highly recommended.
5
absolutely love the food here, good location a short work from all the orchard malls! good service and affordable
5
This is some of the best with fast efficient friendly service and fresh food that is just so tasty. Best you book.
5
Absolutely amazing Chinese food with a beautiful and historic setting at the courtyard of the iconic Goodwood Park Hotel
5
At the invitation of our Singapore hosts we went with a group of 20 to the Min Jiang. It was a wonderful evening. Food was superb, so was the service. I will go back there any time to try out more of their dishes. Nice setting and located at ten minute walk from Orchard Road
4
The solid reputation of this place is deserved. This time around opted for the set dinner at S$ 68 per head with a combo of Cantonese and Sichuan selections and nobody was disappointed. Good variety to choose for each course and the service is as good as the food. Picture of the fiery but delicious grouper dish. Wines carry a hefty markup. Enjoyed a table overlooking the huge hotel swimming pool - a great night
4
My mom was treated by her friends to this restaurant for dim sum about a fortnight ago, and got very good impression of it, so brought me here for dim sum today. We were seated indoors, in the restaurant; however, since it was a cooling day, and not raining, my mom politely asked for us to be seated outside, overlooking the swimming pool. The manager seemed to recognise my mom as one of their customers last time. There was a wide variety of dim sum. And they will be pushed out in trolleys, which we could choose from. They are all very fresh, well done, tasty and to our satisfaction. We also had soup of the day- carrot soup, which was very light. The chicken feet was good. In fact, their dim sum not as oily as those in some of the other restaurants. Their lotus leaf rice was also good, and filling too, though adjusted to meet the customer's needs. Basically, since we were only 2 people, so they just gave us 2 pieces, so I guess if more people, they would give us more. They also were polite enough to come to ask my mom before their last serving time if there was something else that we liked to order, which my mom mentioned about a specialty roll, and it came quickly. As my mom got their restaurant privilege card, she got discount. And the good thing is that the restaurant does accept American Express, which can be turned into mileages as my mom is a frequent flyer of Singapore Airlines. Will definitely be coming back to this restaurant again
5
I go often to this outlet with friends and family and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food or the service. The food is consistently good and the outdoor seating has a great ambience for extended conversations. Will be visiting this place more.....Only downside....it is NOT cheap..
5
The restaurant has outstanding quality food, warm ambience and superior service. A great place to dine with family and friends. Advisable to book a table before hand. Parking is convenient.
4
Loved it. Great Chinese food and friendly staff. Setting is outstanding. Beautiful colonial house off orchard.
5
My husband and I eat at Min Jiang at the Goodwood Park Hotel every time we are in Singapore.
The duck is to die for, which ever way you have it.
Great service and the food all round is delicious.
Can't wait until next time.
5
Went there fairly late, so there were quite a few people at the restaurant already, and a visibly busy staff. Yet, they were able to get a table for me (I had no reservation), with even a choice of indoors or outdoors (I was impressed). The food came surprisingly fast, and exceeded expectations fully (the duck there is superb, I might add). The staff were very friendly, helpful and very attentive. Quite simply, one of the best meals I have had anywhere, in Singapore and out
5
Great food ,good menu ,helpful staff.Just look around you will be surrounded by locals they know where to eat.My wife is Gluten & Lactose Intolerant but that was no problem the staff explained and recommended dishes to suit.You can sit in air conditioning or out by the pool where we enjoyed the Singapore heat
5
In my view, Min Jiang is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore. The delicious food & varied menu are complemented by an excellent service team who sort of remember what your preferences are even if you visit again after a couple of months! Sunday brunches are great with innumerable dim sums to choose from the trolley that goes around. Options of sitting outdoors by the pool or indoors makes it very convenient.

The restaurant at Goodwood Park had been highly regarded by me in the past. I hosted a dinner for some friends on 25 June 2015. It was devastatingly disappointing.We were politely received and shown to our table. The food was also served politely but most unprofessionally. To highlight 3 out of 6 or 7 items on the menu that went wrong:1. Steamed Fish Hong Kong StyleThis came without warning soon after the starter and one other dish. We had hardly finished the first two items! We had no choice but to eat it as steamed fish has to be eaten soon as it leaves the steamer.2. Peking DuckThe skin of the duck is normally 'carved' (or rather sliced out) in front of the diners and the skin is wrapped in very thin steamed pastry either by the guests or in front of the guests. Not in Ming Jiang Restaurant. Here the diners never saw the whole duck. The skin had been sliced somewhere else, but were wrapped in front of the guests. However the skin of the duck - which is really the highlight - was NOT crispy and the pastry was somewhat thick and doughy.3. Asparagus with scallopsAnother disappointment! Both the asparagus and scallops tasted and looked gluey or starchy. I would have wanted to give a written feedback to the restaurant directly, but could not find a facility for feedback

This was a last minute decision to eat in this restaurant. My business partner and I thought we would take a punt as I had heard this place had great Peking Duck. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner of the Goodwood Park Hotel - a colonial landmark in Singapore. We ordered two dishes - The Peking Duck and boiled beef in Szechuan clay pot. This was served with steamed rice. The duck was initially served as duck skin pancakes. This melted in our mouths. Portions were served with just the right amount of Hoi sin sauce. As there were only two of us we ordered half a duck. The dish was scrumptious. The duck skin was perfectly cooked. We opted for the shredded duck done in ginger as our second rendition of the duck. Ginger perfused the shredded duck slices and this was a perfect accompaniment for the rice. Then the Schezuan clay pot. Perfectly spicy and full of flavour. One of the best Chinese meals I have had for a long time. Service was superb

We visited as a group of 6 and had a fabulous meal. Both meat and vegetarian dishes were to the highest quality. The main issue was with service. After 10pm on a Saturday the staff became very rude and made it very clear we needed to vacate the table. I had a word with the manager who was apologetic. But this type of service is not what one would expect from goodwood.

The hotel has a bit of history and one can think of being in the colonial ages of Singapore. Rooms are comfortable, good size, bed is big and mattress soft. The two swimming pools are great, not very crowdy and if you feel like having a little drink on your chair, it may be worth bringing your own. Unless you are at the outside restaurant, no one will come and ask if you want anything. This is good in a sense that you are completely at peace and can enjoy the calm.  The hotel is perfectly located with metro 300 m away, orchard road as well. In short, much better atmosphere than in any large chain of hotels. Definitely a good spot

Lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon - was a new experience for us. Excellent food with a good range of both savoury and sweet choices.
4
Lovely Food good service, a little bit expensive but certainly get what you pay for. We sat outside on the terrace, sublime.
5
dined at Min Jiang whilst staying Goodwood Park Hotel. Food was absolutely divine, with Graf wine list available. Excellent service and out waitress was very helpful with our menu choices. Even if a bit pricey, it was an excellent dining experience.
4
Was there for CHinEse new year lunch. They have a different menu for this festive season. The salmon yu Sheng is fresh and good. The captain recommended a few dishes which I thought are decent. Food generally 3.5/5.
Parking isn't complimentary. That is a surprise.
2
We had a table by the pool. The service was terrible and slow. The menu description did not adequately describe the dish.
4
Superb food,authentic Chinese cuisine. service could be improved though..nice setting, good for family and business. I would recommand to my friend.
5
So much choice, high quality food and great service. Food was spectacular...could have stayed all day
4
Went with family and baby on Saturday.Unfortunately they got our booking wrong to start with, and gave us tables outside the restaurant by the stairs, which wasnt the best place.The food was very good, with lots of choice.but a lot of queuing, and not enough serving spoons and utencils. You have to form a long straight queue, instead of an island , and some people take ages to move along. Which is. Very annoying!!!!The hot meals were tasty and a good choice of cold cuts.WE ALL ENJOYED THE DESSERTS. The Creme Brulee was very good.A pleasant afternoon and would recommend it
4
Amazing place and delightful menu. If you want to be impressed and don't mind something a little different, this is the place to go. Entertainment was amazing and the cocktails were great. We had a great space upstairs on a quiet Sunday night.I urge you to make this a "must visit" if you go to singapor

I just celebrated my birthday here with a wonderful dinner. We ordered the crab meat and asparagus soup, prawns with salted egg yolks, pork ribs braised with blended sauce, Japanese mee sua with crab meat and prawn, and yee fu noodles with king prawn in xo sauce. They were all good. We also ordered a deep fried quail. For people who love deep fried food like I do, this is really wonderful. The quail is deep fried to a golden brown and comes with small cubes of assorted vegetables which are coated in batter and deep fried as well. Nice! The service is prompt and friendly, even though it was quite crowded. Look out also for these little chairs that they use which seem to be small replicas of the chairs that you sit on. It's for ladies to place their handbag! Love it
5
We had peking duck, smoked duck, roaster aubergine and a vegetable dish. Too much food, but it was really tasty all of it :)
4
I celebrated my birthday dinner in this restaurant. Food was great, it is a bit expensive but totally worth it. The xiao lung bao was really yumm...
5
Fabulously authentic food and great service - the Peking Duck 2 ways was beautifully presented and perfect. The dim sum were well proportioned and delicious. A lovely restaurant!
5
You'd better try Gong Bao Ji Ding here, my favourite one. Beijing Duck also good, two styles is fresh and interesting.
5
I've visited Min Jiang several times over the last five years, and the restaurant has never disappointed! The food is authentic and the ingredients are fresh and top quality. It's no exaggeration to say that every dish has been cooked to perfection. Be sure to try their duck and garlic pork. The dim sum is also the best I've had in Singapore. They're served in old-style carts and are simply delicious!Yes - the place can be quite pricy, but it's definitely worth the money. Good for both business and casual meals. Staff are very friendly, knows the menu well and make very good recommendations. Will definitely visit again
3
Came here in couple of occasions and the food never disappoints. The prawns in XO sauce and dimsum is delicious but the chicken with red chillies is not the authentic version like one gets in other Sichuan restaurants. For a nice view sit outside facing the pool. The service however is very very slow and the staff do work at a glacial pace. So if you are in. Hurry then this might not be the best choice for a meal .
2
Great setting but the service was terrible. Orders arrived at different times, the margarita was undrinkable and tasted like salt water, one order had to be changed because they forgot it and the kitchen had closed (15 minutes after everyone else had finished eating my friend was still waiting for her meal and had to ask where it was), appetizer arrived after mains, charged $10 per head for water and the appetizer on the table upon arrival (which we didn't request) we were billed for. No apology given and the food wasn't very good. Won't be eating there again
4
For all lovers of Dim Sum this is one of the best places in Singapore to go. We have been here a couple of times, also with a number of friends. Each time we had fun, loved the food and enjoyed the atmosphere. And when you ask for the bill you will love it even more. For that amount of money it is difficult in this city to find the same value for money. Don't forget, you are in a 5 Star Hotel Restaurant
5
My husband and I were staying at Goodwood Park and as we did last year, dined at Min Jiang. We couldn't wait to get back here. The best Mango duck ever, didn't disappoint us. We had other dishes also, but the duck was the highlight.It is so nice to go back to a restaurant, in another country, a year plus later and find it still dishes up the best food.Until next year, keep up the good work

Min Jiang offers very interesting menu choices. It probably is the only Chinese restaurant that I have ordered fish served with delicate fruit. (I don't exactly recall the type of fish from a few weeks ago, but I seem to recall that it was strawberry on top.) I did try tea smoked duck also - a bit hard to eat, pieces are small and hard to hold. But the tea smoked duck is still well worth ordering. I had excellent beef, presented in cubes, covered in pepper sauce on an earlier visit. The choice of tea was very relaxing. I decided to skip alcohol.Min Jiang has a sister restaurant, Min Jiang North, approx 5 km away. If you are a tourist visiting Singapore, to be candid, it is not worth the drive. I went there a year ago, the menu was similar, the atmosphere was very good as was the service, but staying and eating in a relaxed way at Mon Jiang at the Goodwood Park Hotel is just fine.
5
This is a restaurant that has got a lot of rewards and that is well deserved. Fantastic presented. Helpful and top service.
3
Breakfast was good.
Thanks to the omelette lady who is patient in assisting us and thanks to David and Steven.
4
We tried a lot of small dishes and all of them were amazing. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice and trendy. This was a new experience of Chinese food for me and the best one I've ever had.
5
decided to try out this restaurant as as we were recommended by our hotel . Lovely and delicious dim sums that were fresh and authenic. There is also a very wide variety of dim sum available. We love the shrimp dim sun and the steamed rice rolls. The falvours were so delicate and the dishes were very refined.The Peking duck was fabulous. Very cripsy skin but not too oily. We enjoyed the very authentic chinese cusinine here and the beautiful ambience of a contemporary restaurant in a historic hotel. The service was attentive and the manager was always nearby if we need some advice or explaination about the cusinine or dimsums. Will certainly visit again 
5
The ambience of the outdoor dining area is a perfect accompaniment to the gracious service and wonderful food. There is a varied selection of nicely portioned Chinese food which is beautifully prepared and delicious. Service is perfect and not over bearing or rushed. A wee bit pricey, but worth every cent
4
Overall a good restaurant where the dining room is nice cosy and you can eat outside close the swimming pool. Service is very good and efficient. A good chinese restaurant, prices are a bit high, you will have to pay 10 SGD taxes included for 4 dumplings. 45 SGD for half duck. 10 boxes for a coke. The duck was good, but do not take pekin duck cooked with rices/ fried rices style; indeed the rices contained too much oil/fat. Be carefull when eating the bacon on the table when waiting your meal, it will cost you an extraa 10 boxes as well, in point of view it is not acceptable this kind of thingslot of locals, and family oriented big table
5
This place is great...and when I say 'this place' I mean the entire Goodwood Hotel and the adjoining establishments.Colonial chic, lots of space, low building structure sitting atop a small hill, constructed with an internal courtyard with a big pool....and there a wonderful Sichuanese restaurant with tables on a covered terrace. Apparently still family owned which might explain why the charm hasn't been lost.In a town overflowing with tall towers, bustling malls, no sunlight and modern construction everywhere, this place is a breath of fresh air.Getting back to our meal. family dinner. Pleasant staff sits us outside and we begin to explore a menu full of classics and all too often overlooked dishes.If course Sichuan pepper reigns over several of the dishes and the proportions are civilized- no meltdowns were had, though my mouth was pleasantly tingling after the crispy rice with seafood Sichuan style.Could go on about the shredded pork, tofu or the vegetables, but I will stop & suggest you check it out for yourself.Warmly recommended for a peaceful and charming meal in the bustling heart of Singapore.Warmly recommended and looking forward to discovering the hotel soon
5
We really enjoyed our meal here. Good quality food, friendly service. The wine selection is perhaps on the pricey side, but the Chinese food is of such good quality. The Peking Duck 2 ways was outstanding. The dumplings, the tofu and spare ribs - all great. I'd love to come back again. Thanks for a great meal!FYI - it's over air conditioned inside. Outside has plenty of fans and a pleasant view
5
This is a lovely restaurant and the only one we visted twice during our recent trip to Singapore though, to be fair, this was partly due to the fact we happened to be staying in the Goodwood Park Hotel anyway.Food is Chinese style and excellent! On both occasions we had to sit outside, near the main swimming pool, as no indoor seating was available. This wasn't a problem though, as the outside tables had overhead cooling fans that kept things comfortably cool... and we thought the outside tables much more attractive anyway. Besides, on walking through the indoor area, we though the a/c was set much too cold.Great food and inexpensive good quality house wine

We were staying at the Goodwood Park hotel, and we had an 8 o'clock dinner at Min Jiang without a reservation. We felt it was hot outside by the pool, so we chose to eat inside. They were quite busy at the time with several large groups, but the server was attentive, and the food came promptly. We had enjoyed eating at Min Jiang more than ten years ago when the dish now called kung pao diced chicken with dried chilies used to be called Szechuan chicken with very large chunks of chicken and large rolled chili barks. The new version was good but not as large or tasty. The fried mantou were large and went well with the chicken. My wife had a mini-pork belly that was excellent: delicious sweet meat and very little fat. We had glutinous rice-covered durian (four dumplings in one serving) for dessert. The durian must have been D-24 because it was rich, soft, and sweet. For those who love durian, this is an outstanding and unique dessert treat. Goodwood Park Hotel excels in durian desserts. Overall, the dining experience was very good
4
A lovely setting, great food and service. Have the duck which is an interesting twist on Peking Duck
5
I ate there while staying at the Goodwood Park Hotel and this is one of the best Chinese retaurant in town.
4
A bit pricey and portions are small. Quality of food is abv average. This restaurant has been here for some yrs. Perhaps the last 2-3 restaurants here in Singapore which does push cart tim sum. Ambience is good.
5
Consistently good chinese cuisine served by articulate intelligent staff. We had a beautiful flawless dinner outdoors poolside. dumplings, fresh fish, peking duck and mango pudding.
5
I enjoyed an excellent meal here. Wish I'd been brave enough to go for the sea cucumber but my beef dish could not have tasted better. Enjoy!
4
I suggest eating in the outside terrace by the poolside. Food is always good and relaible and the service is friendly. Extensive menu and wine list. Prices are very reasonable for the quality.
4
I have been to this Resturant every time I visit singapore n it never fails to impress me with the quality of tasty Chinese food. I always want to come back as their standard is always consistent n they are very accommodating n let you bring your own wine n liquor
4
Have been coming to this place for many years, and after a couple of years absence, had dinner again. Food is still exceptional, Peking duck to die for, and the hotel pool view calming. Try dim sum for lunch, can't go wrong with it. Service was a bit off last time, hopefully it gets fixed, but overall, still a reliable and quality experience
5
On a rainy sunday in Singapore we booked in for afternoon tea and had a relaxing afternoon with good food and excellent service. The food is far more varied than a traditional afternoon tea but does include delicate sandwiches, scones with jam and cream and cakes. However there is far kore on offer with canap√É¬©s, veggies with dips, hot pasta dishes and asian dishes and fresh fruit. I recommend this highly. The atmosphere is full of gentle chatter a couples and groups get together. Dress is formal but that is part of the fun
5
Min Jiang is consistently good . Try Peking Duck and then enjoy the duck meat with really delicious noodles. The dim sum is a wonderful way to get together with friends and family . If you sit on the terrace you can enjoy the pool but you can also dine inside. The staff are ready to help with selections if you are a novice at Dim Sum
5
Great chinese food. The tropical storm, rain and lightning was also entertaining. Nice to be within the hotel and able to get great food.
4
Great food, good service, price appropriate to the location (it's in the hotel!). Staff were very helpful. Good selection of vegetarian options.
5
We had the sliced duck breast with mango .... sublime. As well as other dishes. A Chinese family at the next table were having a birthday party for great-grandma. We took photos for the whole family and were thanked by sharing in the cake!
3
i went there for dim sum lunch. Place is nice close to the swimming pool and the service is good. But the food is unfortunately just average. Don't recommend it.
5
My husband and I were recently staying at the Goodwood Park Hotel. We had made a reservation well in advanced after doing our homework through Tripadvisor.Everything was spot on and we were blown away with the duck with mangoes. It was the best duck we have ever had.We also had a dish of scallops which was to die for, you don't get such large scallops here in Adelaide, Australia.A delightful dining experience. Thank you
4
Ask for a table outside by the pool, it's a beautiful garden setting (all the chinese are sitting inside because of the aircon, but interior is average). Must eat: Peking duck 2 styles: 1 is traditional in pancakes, try the other style fried with spring onion and garlic. superb! we also had some dim sum and chili prawns, which where also nice but nothing special. SERVICE: not very attentive, staff seems to be overstrained and not well trained. we had to ask several times for new drinks and the bill. However all in all I would recommend to go here for the peking duck and the nice place
4
Great restaurant situated nicely in the historic and attractive Goodwood Park Hotel just off Orchard Road. We went there for it's Sichuan reputation. The menu was fantastic and the delivery matched - interesting Chinese dishes outstandingly presented; each dish was an adventure. As for Sichuan - not bad for anything actually outside of Chengdu, but a bit Sichuan-lite. I would definitely go back
4
We were staying at the hotel and normally never eat at a Hotel restaurant. But word of mouth was that this was worthwhile and I'm very glad we did. As withn the hotel, everything they do here is classy, from the food to decor to service. You don't feel you're in a busy food factory as many places in Singapore do. Go and enjo
4
When we sat down and opened the menu OMG. The choice was huge and we were not very familiar with anything on the menu. The waiter was fantastic and helped us choose some great dishes. We got to try lots of different things and he made us feel very comfortable. It is not cheap though and the wine is very expensive
3
This is the second time my family dined in this hotel for afternoon tea. The last time we dined here were in June this year. At that time, they have a much wider selection. This time their selection became fewer than before. Their crispy chicken, and meatballs are quite good. There is a wide range of desserts too, and fruits. You can have 2 refills of the drinks that you had. The only downside is that the atmosphere is a bit too noisy, and so the waiter took the wrong order, so instead of giving my husband the Cappucino that he ordered, he was given the hot Mocha instead. I also had to wait for a while for my refill of the vanilla tea
5
The dim sums are brilliant and the restaurant constantly serves innovative dishes. Service is impeccable and very helpful if you are a novice. Dim sums afternoon tea is economical way of trying this legendary restaurant.
2
If you want to have dim sum buffet here, think you are better off eating at one of our food centre. Their dim sum are cold and it taste just like any food centre standard.
5
The Peking Duck, chicken cooked and done in different ways, the herbal soups, and the dim-sums.
2
Unhelpful waitress. Didn't seem to get what we thought we had ordered. Too expensive fo what we got.
5
Fantastic location, food, and staff. Better than the stand alones.
5
This place is best known to locals and visitors primarily for their outstanding dim sum at lunch.....but the dinner menu has all sorts of delectable dishes. I went with two local friends and enjoyed absolutely every dish (five in all) that we ordered. Service and ambience were excellent as well
5
Went to Min Jiang after a long time and this time, brought some colleagues from overseas to one of my long time favorites.First thing that I noticed that it has been moved from the Annex building across from the main hotel to within the hotel proper.It was a nice evening and we decided to be seated outside by the pool. A wise decision. The ambiance was just perfect. The food that we ordered came very quickly and each dish was well prepared and tasted just great.Only a couple of comments about the food. We ordered the Peaking Duck but unlike more other establishments that serves this, the duck comes pre carved to the table. What we miss with this it the "show" of the bird being carved.The other comment is the Szechuan Chicken. The version served here is the one which comes with sauce. The other variation that I have tried was the dry version which is a lot more potent. For those with a more 'delicate' taste bud, the version served by Min Jiang would be perfect.One comment from my overseas colleague was that the food was a assault to his taste buds but it was an assault that he would gladly have repeated.Great evening, great food in an equally great environment with some great colleagues
5
The Food was delicious... and we sat outside by the pool side. The service is good and fast. The food was good - dim sums, chicken with chillies, salty sigh, chiken with beans is what we had ordered and the food was very tasty and each dish had its own defined taste. This is an expensive resteraunt in comparison to other places we ate at... but so worth it
4
We first visited this establishment in 1985 on a 3 night stopover in Singapore (on our way to Australia) and things have not changed. It is not the atmosphere we see (and seek) in Europe but a bustling busy busy popular restaurant. Having said that, the d√É¬©cor was pleasant, the service very efficient even when the place was packed. As for the food.... Well I can tell you that we stopped eating Chinese food back home for many years after that.So where to go and eat when in Singapore??? Goodwood Park Hotel Chinese Restaurant every time. We still do.....
2
We were recommended to visit this restaurant by many of our friends, so we decided to have our dinner at this restaurant. we are vegetarians. We found the service below par and the food was nothing great. The main course came with a gap whereby the food got cold by the time everything came in. It was a busy restaurant but all in all did not enjoy our evening
