Revisited after more than two years. Tried the same few signature dishes again, still like them. However, the wow factor was not there anymore. But the service has improved a lot compared to last time.

Anyone that has spent time in Shanghai will appreciate the authenticity of the food here and it is delicious. I advise booking in advance as it gets very busy.

Only metres from the Jin'an Temple station this Chinese restaurant is on the 4th floor on 1600 Nanjing West. Very well appointed large comfortable dining room, very well patronized by the locals. A lovely waitress helped us negotiate the menu and the protocol which clearly is not designed for foreign visitors, The food was very tasty and although we did not order the most expensive dishes it was reasonably priced at 180 RMB for a dumpling entrÃ©e, two mains and rice. Service was exceptional

This place is great if you want some home-cooked food in the Shanghai style. The sheng jian bao has a pretty thick and chewy crust, compared to the usual restaurant styles you find at other restaurants. So people don't like it, but I really really do.The restaurant is pretty small, and the only staff there are the owner, his wife and their son. So service could be a little slow. And the small size means that the place feels a little cramped and can get somewhat noisy when it's filled with customers.Overall, it's got great food at decent prices but ambience isn't all that fantastic

This little place in Ang Mo Kio HDB flats will only be known to locals. Therefore, was thankful we had our Singaporean friend take us there. Even they had to be recommended by another fellow countryman of theirs. It was a weekend, Saturday but we were there just by 12 noon. There was no crowd yet, and service was friendly, and relatively prompt, despite being warned by our friend, service could be slow as they would cook only from the time we order. We had to try all the regular and popular Shanghainese Xiao Loong Pau, fried pork bun, drunken chicken - the xiao loong pau was very tasty and the fried bun was just a tad lacking in the soup within it. The "tau mew" /bean sprout green was very pricey at SGD12 but the paus were reasonably priced. The spicey dry noodles was very tasty but the one that really took us by surprise was the Wild Rice Stem fried with minced meat, which was delicious. Not something I have ever had before. Apparently this "Ko Pak" is available only near Jiang Su, China. Initially we thought it was a variant of bamboo but it does not have that bamboo smell that is an acquired taste. Dessert was the pumpkin pancake with red bean filling, tasty and would have been healthy except it was pretty oily, as the dessert is deep fried.We had chrysanthemum tea, and for the table charge of SGD1.20 per person, I guess it covered the tea and the wet towel, as there was no separate billing for tea.For the 4 of us, it came up to about SGD20 per head, and we were just nicely filled. By 1pm, the place was full already!If you want a simple lunch, one could get by with just a dish of noodles and a tray of 5 Xiao Loong Pau which won't cost an arm and a leg but will cost more than "mixed rice" at the food court. But there is aircon comfort and place is clean.If given an opportunity, we would visit again. Good quality tasty food

We've been patronizing this outlet since it first started in Sembawang. It gained fame for its Shanghai fried buns which was featured in the papers. During those days, the outlet was bigger and also catered to takeaways. The new outlet in Ang Mo Kio is much smaller and can seat up to 6 tables. They are also no longer able to cater for takeaways anymore due to staff shortage.Food is still as tasty. We ordered the usual house specials - Shanghai fried buns, steamed dumplings, scrambled egg with golden chives, pork chop and chicken noodles, spring rolls and sweet fried pumpkin pie. The food is freshly prepared and cooked only when an order is placed, so they are served steaming hot. Which also explains why service tends to be slow and erratic as they cook each dish in bulk to serve a few orders.The steamed dumplings are juicy and the skin thin. Noodles are flavorful and just a little spicy. Spring rolls are piping hot, crispy on the outside and filled with vegetables and gravy inside. The fried bun is a mixture of crispy bottoms and soft tops. Overall, thumbs up for the food. Helping is quite small though, good for two to three persons. Service tends to get tardy and slow when there is a crowd, which happens often. With only 6 tables and 3 staff (including the owner and his wife who does the cooking), be prepared to get turned away if you didn't place a reservation. My second order was rejected as the cook couldn't cope and they also needed to clear the table for the next reservation, which was a real put-off. On quiet nights, which happens on some weekday evenings, the owner would be less stressed up and a lot friendlier. So if you don't mind having to clear out fast and put up with poor service but good food, by all means visit on a weekend. Otherwise, weekday nights would be a lot less stressful

The dishes are delicious if you enjoy rich heavy flavored foods. However if you think you can fill up your tummy, then you'll have to order lots of dishes. This is because all dishes are small. The steam dumplings are only 5 to a basket. So for 2 persons, you'll need to get 2 baskets. We also ordered the fried buns which are very tasty with gravy in it, together with Shanghai wanton soup, braised pork noodles. The prices are reasonable but the stir-fried Dou Miao is rather pricey at $12 for a small plate. Both of us paid $44 for 4 dishes and tea. A rather reasonable deal. Just not sufficient if you to be filled

Shanghai Renjia was a great discovery. When I landed at the HDB block in Ang Mo Kio, I wasn't expecting to have some of the best, freshest dim sums in Singapore. Run by people from China, it has great Xiao Long Bao. Try all the steamed dumplings; the fried ones are a bit dry and chewy. The black bean paste noodles are very good too. But the best of all are the spring rolls with a unique paste inside to give it a very tender, soft filling. Highly recommended
