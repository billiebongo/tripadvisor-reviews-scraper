Food is nice affordable, good surrounding clean and refreshing look. Fast serving, spacious. Foods seem healthy and yummy.

Had my reunion dinner there, ordered the pen cai enough for 4-6 persons with free flow rice and grains. Overall a good meal with nice quiet environment and good service.
4
Love the salmon and the generous healthy sides ...yums!
Throw the dice and get discount on the beer was fun.
May I suggest to apply on other beverages as well for those who don't drink.
4
Had the 1-for-1 roasted chicken. Food was great. I had to catch the attention of the waiting staff to ask for water. Nice view of the pool. Staff is kind. Had an overall pleasant experience.
5
Nice restaurant, not too busy when we were there. Kids friendly. Nice pool view. Food was definitely good too!
5
This was my upteenth time there and as usual we were welcomed with good food and great service. Love their rice bowls!
4
Not much options to choose from. Had the 6 skewers to share for 2. The taste of skewers were not up to my expectation. Being a meat lover, I would prefer to visit a steak house. However, the purple rice was nice. The multigrain was acceptable.
3
The restaurant located on the 10th Floor of the Yotel Singapore Hotel behind the Shaw House. It is very modern designed; the seat was not so comfortable and table was small. It is good for a drink and snack. The service was too slow compared to Singapore standard which is normally efficient. I had the house special Beer, GH it just okay for afternoon heat. There is a hotel pool next to the restaurant

I am planning to come back and try some of the other grain bowls despite disappointing food flavours on my first visit. I had the Angus Beef with purple sticky rice. The beef tasted bland and cold although it should have come straight from the grill. The rice was also tasteless. But I am willing to give Grains and Hops another chance because of its lovely location and enthusiastic staff

Exactly a month ago was our first visit to this little gem of a restaurant, tucked away in a quiet corner of busy Orchard Road. Service was good then though the food was a little below expectation; and so we decided to give it another chance and we were not disappointed. It was a quiet evening with just a handful of occupied tables. Orders were taken swiftly and attentively and water cups refilled quickly. Reminded the service staff of our last visit and what we were expecting and these were taken seriously as seen in the food that was presented. They even did a check back a short while after our first few bites. Though the salad was served without the marinated mushrooms, this was corrected quickly without any fuss. Paull(the service staff at our last visit) checked out our bill and even remembered our last visit and asked if our previous feedback was taken into consideration. Kudos to the service staff(my apologies for not getting their names) for their attention without being overbearing and the gentle farewells that heightened our experience at Grains and Hops. Thank You, Grains and Hops, for showing true hospitality

Service was slow and lacking
Place is beautiful and quiet
Food is superb but due to lack of service staff, the wait was Long. It was my second time visiting and it hasn’t improved.
4
Had the 1 for 1 chicken, thus it was value for money. The atmosphere and service was excellent, however the food is average.
3
This restaurant is located on the 10th floor of the Yotel, towards the quieter end of Orchard Road. The grains used are all of the healthier choice e.g. quinoa, wholegrains, purple rice. Serving sizes are rather small though.
3
Ordered the roasted chicken bowl and rice was served luke warm while chicken skewer seemed microwave. Flavours didn’t have the wow factor.
4
Quiet place. We ordered the 6 persons skewered platter. Portions suitable for lady, will not be enough for man. Overall food taste okay. Healthy grains. Service is good.
5
The food was delicious & the service staff were very proactive and friendly! Enjoyed my lunch greatly with my friends & son!
5
The restaurant is located on the 10th floor, the same floor as the gym and pool. The evening I was there, it was not crowded. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Soup with Garlic Rice Pops and Grilled Miso Salmon Fish served with multigrain rice and a side of teriyaki sauce and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Rice Krispies for dessert. All three dishes were great choices and they were cooked well. The service was also great.Definitely a place to recommend
5
Take the lift from the lobby (2nd floor) to the 10th floor and you find yourself at the restaurant, which is on the same floor as the gym and pool. In keeping with the hotelâ€™s design concept, the restaurant also took on a space-age look. It also doubles up as a bar, being the only hotel outlet.The staff was welcoming as my partner and I were shown to our table. It was a weekend evening and it was not crowded, or perhaps it was already 9pm.The menu, in the form of a placemat; consists of dishes that are favourable to healthy eaters. Dinner for us was the Wild Mushroom Soup with Garlic Rice Pops (unusual) and Grilled Miso Salmon Fish (deliciously fresh) served with multigrain rice (interesting), a side of greens and accompanied with a bowl of teriyaki sauce. The meal ended on a sweet note with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Rice Krispies (the bed of Rice Krispies was a tad tough to cut into) served with Vanilla Ice-Cream.This is one of the few restaurants that promote healthy eating.
5
The food is great - my friend and I both had the roasted chicken and one drink, and it was affordable and delicious. Cocktails and craft beers both go for around $15 here. The vibe was cool - Yotel is an edgy space themed sort of hotel (think Star Trek and neon space shuttle lights/paraphernalia) - and definitely too understated for a weekday dinner. Bring your friends and party on, this place has the right ambience and space for it
5
The food was decent although not entirely outstanding - nevertheless, a good bargain considering the price (<$30 p/pax) and location (a few minutes' walk from Orchard MRT/Tangs). Both indoors (sleek, modern, chic) and outdoors (quiet, yet claustrophobic and with a poor, blocked, low-floor view) seating. A key offering is Yotel's relative newness and hence Grains & Hops's low-keyness, making it a great getaway in the heart of town. This may change in the future. Of equal noteworthiness was the spirited and authentic service - it was evident that the entire service crew - at least, the waiters/waitresses who served us - all had the same warm and personal touch. A rare gem for a rather affordable restaurant, hence a must-visit-again for me
4
Definitely worth the visit. The staff are very friendly and polite, even though it seems like they are short on staff.
The rice taste delicious, however, the portion could be slightly larger.
They have very unique dips available to go with the skewers.
5
Great ambience, wonderful service, sumptuous food! What more can I ask for! Would definitely head down again!
4
One for one roast chicken bowl was delicious, restaurant has a nice ambience and the service staff were friendly and attentive.
5
Great delicious food in a quiet and unpretentious environment. It's a new place and my friends and I had a really good dining experience there.
5
We were there for a birthday celebration .The ambience was great and the service was fantastic! Keep up the good work!
4
Roasted chicken bowl was delicious n fresh but took a long time to be served; which was surprising as there were not many customers. The coconut rice pudding n coffee were excellent as well. Though the cafe was hard to locate on the 10th floor of Yotel, it had a lovely ambience
3
Was a decent lunch given that there was a 1 for 1 bowl special. Tasted fine, but not outstanding. The restaurant is part of the new Yotel, so it had a bright and loungy vibe in keeping with the hotel style. Service was good. Winding maze to get there from Orchard Road.
4
We had the roasted chicken grain bowl which was the 1 for 1 deal of the month. I don't think I would have paid $15 for the bowl without the deal, but regardless, the meat was fresh and the rice well flavoured. I think the icing on the cake was the great service by the waiters and waitresses who were all attentive and pleasant
4
Tucked away behind Shaw House is Yotel, a hotel that promotes affordable hospitality with a luxurious touch. G&H hides away on the tenth floor of this facility with its high 5m ceiling offering superb space for the dining crowd. I came with my wife for the 1-for-1 chicken promotion initially but ended up ordering a coconut curry soup and a grains salad on the side out of good'ole curiosity. Both sides proved to be a smash for our discerning local palates. The chicken was simple but well grilled with three side salads. Great price for the location and service. The service team deserves mention. They are attentive and welcoming. It was a gratifying meal in a fantastic ambience. I have regained some faith in my failing local cuisine experience
5
Greeted by friendly staffs upon arrived at the restaurant and was promptly directed to our seats. Restaurant is spacious and has a nice overall ambience. Ordered a salmon and a beef main course, both dishes are fabulous and portion are just nice. Salted caramel milk shake is delicious too. Great place!
5
The 1 for 1 Roasted Chicken is great value for money and delicious! Juicy chicken served with tasty basmati rice, nutritious and wholesome.
4
I like the Marmite chicken pops. For more than 2 persons, do consider "build your own sharing platters
4
Good food at affordable prices. Recommend the bacon spring roll! Service was good too, ambience was quiet!
5
The grain bowls were really good and flavourful. Do try the marmite chicken pops - it goes well with the house craft brew that has green tea infusion!
3
The food was good. The choices of meat are complete; chicken fish beef and pork available. Limited choice of carbohydrates. It would be better if there were fries, onion rings, mash potatoes, and pastas.
4
The ambience at grains and hops is pretty nice, despite the small tables for two. Food is decent, especially the deep fried rice balls filled with ham and cheese. All in all this place has an interesting concept!
3
Went before the dinner rush at around 5.30! Restaurant was completely empty so we were attended to promptly and food came quickly (~8 minutes?) My friend ordered the vegetarian bowl which was slightly disappointing as the polenta cakes on the skewers were very underseasoned, mushy & oily. It left much to be desired! I ordered the mixed grain spelt salad with marinated mushrooms which I really enjoyed, however! Dressing was ample, with sufficient veggies and mushrooms mixed into the grain. the serving size was pretty large, and it was good enough to be eaten as a main! alright experience, but probably wouldnâ€™t come here again because of the food. ambience was good though, and the staff were very attentive (they always refilled my water glass) :)
5
The interior of Grains and Hops was spacious and the colour scheme was pleasing to the eyes. It creates a great ambience and relaxing atmosphere for dining. The staff were attentive and polite. We had the roasted chicken skewer rice bowl which was delicious in our opinion. The portion of the chicken meat served was rather generous, and the sambal mayo sauce complemented the chicken. The sambal mayo sauce was lightly spicy and we were able to taste the fragrance of the shrimps in the sauce. It was an enjoyable meal and we will head back to try out the rest of the menu.
4
Discovered the hotel and this restaurant on level 10. Their home beer is good and the waiters are helpful and patient. Decided to eat there as the location was nice. Followed the recommendations, roasted Angus beef (changed rice to the multi grains) and grill salmon. Wasn't disappointed at all, tasted good with perfect portions
5
I had the 1 for 1 Roasted Chicken rice bowl. Good value for money with the promo. The roasted chicken skewers were tasty and juicy. rice fluffy and fragrant. Overall a good meal with nice setting
4
The food bowl is extre delightful and delicious and the staff is able to make good recommendations. Menu includes wide variety of berveages. Would like to try homebrew microbrewery in future.
4
Airy space makes for comfortable ambience. Friendly service & simple good food; chicken was juicy & friend enjoyed her vegetarian bowl too
5
Dined with my family of 7. We had the perfect meal. Well marinated and generous portions of meats and servings of carbs and veggies were just right. Grains and Hops stands out for its attentive service. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable about their food and drinks and professional. They had an interesting happy hour promotion. Roll a dice and the number rolled indicates the discount you get. Will definitely visit again.
5
Amazing ambience with cosy feel. The food served was superb and a taste of its own. Will surely return again to this place
4
Had their one for one promo for dinner. Service crew were attentive and polite. Food tasted good and beer was nice as well.
4
Hard to come by not so crowded yet serving decent food with good service from waiters and waitresses.The dipping sauces are nice
4
it was our first visit to Grains and Hops and we were not disappointed. brightly lit, cozy restaurant with excellent service staff and fresh, healthy and tasty foods. ordered 3 of their signature rice bowls and deep fried rice balls, quinoa avocado salad and coconut curry carrot soup. excellent and honest recommendations from service crew Paull. the roasted angus beef rice bowl was paired with purple sticky rice. the roasted angus beef had a good bite with light or no marinating. 3 cubes on each skewer had, strangely, a cube that was medium rare, medium and medium well, when our order was for a medium. the miso salmon was paired with multigrain rice and was cooked just right without the miso overpowering the fresh taste of salmon. the roasted kurobuta pork collar was paired with quinoa instead. the quinoa was great with a light salt and garlic. however, we were a little disappointed with the pork collar. though the pork collar was well marinated, it was tough and took some effort with the chewing. this, we understood at a later time was not right and that it should have been tender. the quinoa avocado salad was nicely paired with a lemon mustard vinagrette dressing which was appetising but a little too generous for the serving size of salad. the deep fried cheese and ham rice balls was just excellent. perfect combination of rice cheese and ham and the temp control was obviously done well for it was not cloying even though deep fried. the coconut curry carrot soup intrigued us with the name and it was like eating prata without the flour and just the curry. it was obvious this restaurant value their customers and want to do well. we were presented with a serving of churros, complimentary from the chef, for the misrepresentation of the roasted kurobuta pork collar. it was totally unexpected and we’re grateful they accepted our feedback and did a immediate recovery. the service crew were serving with smiles and and were attentive - plates were cleared swiftly and water refilled without our requesting for them. they even apologised we were given a small table for they were running full house and took the initiative to serve our order course-by-course so as not to overcrowd the table. kudos!! having been in the f&b industry myself, customer-oriented service crew is a difficult role to fill but with passion, it becomes easier. and, yes, their passion do come through naturally! thank you, Grains and Hops for making our christmas dinner a memorable one. we will be back soon
5
The staff of The restaurant are very helpful! Always give us discount! The ambience and cleanliness are very good
5
For price and good food, Grains & Hops matches all the other quality restaurants around Orchard Road. But our waiter Paull, was amazing. After popping our head in to have a look at Yotel’s restaurant, Paull greeted us with a smile and laugh, showed us around the restaurant and actually made us want to come back to have a meal here. And so we did and we weren’t disappointed. Thank you Paull and to the Chef, you made our dining experience great!
3
nice atmosphere, food complete with healthy rice... air conditioning not strong enough...menu not much variety, mostly complete with rice..
4
The meal was excellent, it tasted really well and the atmosphere of the place was wonderful. However, as we are in a group of 40, the serving of food is slightly slower than normal and it made some of us impatient. But overall, a nice dining experience
5
Has been there several times for their roasted angus rice bowl. Changed mine to quinoa that is cooked so fluffy. So good that it had me going back time and again. Gotta try their double chocolate Guinness milkshake! Staff are friendly and accommodating. Chef took the additional effort to personalise this for my friend’s birthday! Thanks, Paul, for bringing us some tidbits for the drinks.
5
Had the one for one deals available during lunch. The salmon miso was so well marinated and cooked to perfection. Never tasted such juicy salmon. It wasn’t hard nor dry like most salmons I have eaten at other restaurants. Specially recommended by the manager, Adrian. No regrets at all! The roasted Angus beef was yummy too though a bit fatty. Nice ambience and will definitely go back there again. Quiet enough to catch up with friends over a nice meal
5
Food was tasty and generous in portions. Loved the ambience.. A great place for a weekend chilling session with friends.
4
Their roasted Angus beef signature bowl was unique in a sense that purple sticky rice were used. However, it could have been better if the beef were roasted slightly longer. Oh and service were great
5
Just had a dinner gathering there is week. We ordered their set menus and loved the food! The place is very quiet as it’s quite new and it’s in a tucked away location. Hope more people will find the place and enjoyed it too
5
One of the best service in a restaurant I've been to. Staff are attentive and friendly. Food is yummy and of a good quantity! The beef bowl is a must try
4
This was a great new location in orchard and it was great discovering it before the crowds descended. Food was tasty and service was friendly.
4
Nice atmosphere and located in new fancy hotel! I had the deep fried pork loin grain bowl but it was not nicely done; meat over fried and not too fresh.
5
Went there to celebrate a friend’s birthday. We brought our own cake, however, don’t know why the waitress didn’t help me bring the cake over (meant to be a surprise) and I had to do it myself. Then a waiter came over and we jus told him what happened. After that, he came back with a surprise dessert for my friend on the house! V sweet and nice gestures! Thank you
5
Managed to taste most of the rice bowls & happy with our choices. Lovely environment & attentive staff who make one feels welcomed. Will definitely visit again!
5
I’ve dined at Grain and Hops for 4 times in the last 2 months! Even though the location isn’t that great and the background music is a tad too loud and intrusive, but the food, service and overall environment is great! Will definitely recommend for groups to visit to make use of either the Chope discount or the lunch time 1-for-1 rice bowl discount! Food will be a tad expensive without the discounts.
5
This was a really awesome restaurant- we went in a group of 10, and it was great! Food was yummy and reasonably priced. Beer is a must-have!
4
Waiters were very enthusiastic. It's new and we reserved dinner through chope.sg. Surrounding in Royal Purple. Drop by if that's your favourite colour
4
Health choice of food. But not much variety. Unable to attract mass patron at large. Would be great to include others food theme
4
Love the welcoming feeling the moment we stepped into the restaurant. We (my family) were so eager to try many dishes from the menu and we ended up ordering a lot more but we finished all of it as they were so good!!Ambience was nice and not noisy; perhaps it is still relatively new and the restaurant was half-filled at dinner time. Serving staffs were friendly and service was tip top. I came back for 2 other meals with friends and business associates. It is definitely a good place to go to especially if you would like to have business discussion as they have private corners
5
Service is top notch, the ambience is modern and tasteful (as opposed to futuristic ad clinical) and the grain bowls are to die for. Highly recommended!
4
Service was very good, staff was attentive (because we were the only guests) but very friendly as well. Food was splendid, unfortunately not worth the normal price, i will only go again if it has the 1-for-1 design agai
5
Had the 1-for-1 roasted Angus beef bowl. A lot of meat was given and meat was very juicy and tasty (order was medium). Dip was good and the sides (azchar and salad) were tasty as well. Had their brew which even allowed us to throw a die and get a discount (we rolled a 3 so had 30% off) during happy hours. Very good service and food. Highly recommended
4
Food and service was great, but I visited the place to take advantage of a 1-for-1 offer. During normal times, each bowl would cost >$20, which was not worth it for me. They do have a special 1-for-1 lunch offer so I would come back again but only with the offer.
5
Very value for money, portions are healthy with a variety of tasty vegetables. The angus beef grain bowl was very good!
3
There was a 1 for 1 promotion and it was great! Food and service was impeccable, though location was a little too out of way
4
Genuinely impressed by the quality of service and food dished here only 26 days after the soft launch of Yotel. Tried the Roasted Angus Beef bowl, Churros and housepour beer. Not too crowded during dinner hours for now, hopefully it will remain an undiscovered gem in the heart of Orchar
5
Saw a 1 for 1 Beef Bowl promotion on chope and decided to try. Located on 10th floor of Yotel. Newly opened, they have a monthly promotional set and also a dice game where you can throw the dice and get discounts on your drinks up to 60%. Service was fantastic. Attentive and friendly. The house wine selection was great tasting. Main was a little salty for my tastebud, nicely done for the beef. It came out as expected of well done and medium rare. Will definitely be back again
4
Nice, spacious space that's conveniently on Scotts Road yet tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Food was great value for money especially with the 1 for 1 deals and happy hour! Would def come back again
4
The food was okay - we had the roast beef bowl, and it arrived only lukewarm, which was rather depressing. The beef was also rather chewy. Nevertheless, the ambience is lovely, and the staff are fabulous. We were served by a waiter who certainly knew the menu inside out, and it was great to get his recommendations. They also have a fun activity during happy hour where you can roll a die to get a discount of 10-60% (corresponding to the number on the die)
5
Excellent service from the waiters there. Love the roasted Angus beef grain bowl because the beef is super tender
5
TGIF preferred place - Grains & Hops House Brew is a must try...a very distinct taste of brew thats light & thirst quenching.- Pomelo & Green Bean Salad is of fresh crunchy choice to start your appetite- really liked the roasted angus beef with purple sticky rice...its well done!!!- grilled seafood on skewers with multi grain is also a good choice as not at all heavy to take just right.- ending the meal with a very refreshing Mixed berries Milkshake...although a guilt feeling bcoz of its heavy cream on top but overall blended to its perfectionHighly recommended as its value for your money Ambience is cozyStaff are proactively asking if we need other thingsGreat experience will definitely come back
4
Very nice restaurant set on the 10th floor of Yotel. Staff were helpful and obliging. But it was a shame that the staff only told us about the 1-for-1 mains after we paid the bill, otherwise we would have ordered more
4
Was wondering what to eat and chanced upon Chope 1-1 promotion over at Grains and Hops for its roasted Angus beef bowl. The bowl at $22 came with two decent sized and flavourful roasted beef skewers on a bed of their signature purple sticky rice, house salad and homemade spicy garlic sauce. The rice didnâ€™t quite work for me but my partner liked it. I loved the sauce which went really well with the beef.The place is very bright and lovely overlooking a lap pool. The next time I need to rest my feet after all the shopping, I will pop over for coffee. There are two rooms with sofa perfect for gathering with family and friends
