Very Slow service, one couple gave up and walked out.
We were overcharged when the bill eventually arrived.
We do NOT recommend

A small, but tasty banquet of delicious morsels to take the edge off your appetite, accompanied by a couple of beers, and you're good to go!

Attractive decor and really attentive service. The Peking duck was excellent and the dumplings light and very tasty.

Food is not very good, price is very expensive. For me I don't personally recommend, serve Chinese cuisine.

Jin Shan Lou is a well located restaurant. The men and wine selection is good. The food was fantastic especially the beef with a pepper and red wine sauce. It is a bit pricy bu great for a special occasion.

This was the top lunch we enjoyed while in Singapore. Great set menu for a great price in such an environment. Everything amszing, with meat, prawns, abalone, crab and alikes... a great deal for such a quality. We enjoyed every bite and never felt that we were treated with dedain, as we were not really big spenders, but what a friendly people and top service and food.Hope it will not get crowded after this STRONG recommendation.Thank you for creating this unforgettable memory in Singapore!

Surprised by this relatively average rating as the food here is really nice. Brought my family (wife + boy) here for dim sum. Quality is really nice plus there is some creative twist.. my boy even finished the entire bowl of tomato beef noodle!Definitely on par with the popular ones such as eastern sea in takashimaya and taste paradise in ion

Really surprised to see this restaurant having just 3.5 stars on Tripadvisor.Was here last week and the food was just amazing, the service was absolutely superb.The lady who was serving us really took good care of us and gave us a few suggestions form the menu.The food arrived in quick time. Agreed that it is a bit on the pricey end but it is well worth a visit

Staying at the Marina Bay Sand, this place is never crowded. We ventured out of the hotel for the best chili crab that Singapore us know for, but on the last night we were tired and decided to stay in and try this place for its chili crab. Wow! It was the best chili crab we had in the whole week, better than No Signboard. Service is excellent too.

Nice restaurant, nice food, plenty of choices,we enjoyed ourselves and would go again. Situated in the expansive pedestrian walkway at the fabulous Marina Bay Sands complex and yet still provides a nice ambiance to watch the world go by, buying !!Just for your curiosity, one bottle of wine on the wine list was $88,000,......but it was 62 years old) Yikes!

I recently had dinner here in a group of 10 and we had a selection of main meals. Each meal was wonderful and our service was quite good. We couldn't eat all that we ordered. I will come back again.

We loved their dimsum set menu during the afternoon. Good choices. Ambiance is relaxing. Fast service.

Visited for lunch, not a particularly busy time. Service very slow and most of the staff seems pretty miserable about being there. The food was OK but not awesome. Probably wouldn't come again

Went there with my brother, sister in law from Australia.
Nice and peace environment, food was fresh and tasty and nicely presented.
Price wise not too expensive affordable.
I gave the Tim sum a thumb up

Service was excellent and the Chinese dishes were very tasty. We love Chinese cuisine and this rates with the best.

Avoid this place at all cost. Service is worse than your neighbourhood coffeeshop even though you have to pay the arbitrary service charge which would have been better used at a charity. We had to request for the tea we ordered 3 times before it came which in itself took an eternity. The 1st dish of scallops and broccoli arrived before the traditional Chinese New Year Yu Sheng which we told the waitress to take it back and serve the Yu Sheng first as it is the first dish to be had in any Chinese New Year dinner. Another service staff came back with the scallop dish and no Yu Sheng after 5 mins. It was like Dejavu since this process happened 3 times before the Yu Sheng finally arrived. When refilling my tea cup, the waitress spilled some of tea on my mobile and did not even check if there was any damage done until she noticed me taking the napkin to wipe the screen. Even then, all she did was say a very insincere sorry and walked off.The food quality was barely average and way overpriced for its quality. There are definitely much better options with significantly higher standards in service. One name that comes to mind is Li Bai at Sheraton Towers. If within the same hotel, Imperial Treasure is definitely a much better bet. My advice is to spend your hard earned cash elsewhere

We are from Hong Kong and we know dim sum. We ordered a variety of dim sum and efu noodles (crab meat) for lunch, they are all surprisingly good. Service was attentive and helpful also. Highly recommended if you visit the Sands or the Observation Deck

I read some reviews on this and decided to give it a try with the lunch set for two. It is located in MBS and this explains the price point. For the quality and ambience it is overpriced. There are many better Chinese restaurants around where you can get better value for money. It is suitable for tourists perhaps with its convenient location. I found it too noisy for a proper dining experience

We should have stuck to our original plans of ordering seafood, but when we arrived at the restaurant, we were proposed a special menu for the month of June featuring some guest chefs or something, and thought OK we'll give it a shot.The food was nothing impressive - in fact we felt that the set menu was overpriced. The presentation was beautiful, but the food itself was underwhelming. The cold cuts tasted weird, the battered prawn was just really fancy tempura (and who only eats one of those?) and the battered and fried chicken afterwards needed some sauce to go with it. Only the lotus rice and the soup were good.We'll probably come again, but we won't be deviating from their standard menu again

Food was so good we ate here twice during our stay. Service was good. Menu had plenty of choice and the food was great.

Whole family visited this restaurant on 28 Jun (dinner) and 29 Jun (brunch). The waiters/waitress are not attentive, all not wearing a smile, and all seems unhappy.Tea is not being refill promptly.Waited dessert (eventually cancelled them) for more than 30min.There is definitely problem within the service team. Food is still good.Overall, can still eat there but don't expect top restaurant service level although they are top restaurant (good quality food).The management needs to do something

Safe food at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The service here was terrific and the atmosphere a buzz. A big menu with lots of International dishes. Remember, don't tip - the locals get a bit offended as they like to think their food is priced well and there is no need to pay more

We went on a busy sat afternoon for a late lunch. The food was okay, but quite overpriced given the lacking ambience and service. We ordered a set lunch each and the waitresses were in a hurry to serve everything even though we had not finished each course. It seems strange to rush through the entire meal though there were not that many patrons. The plates were piling up on the small table. Portions were little, the only saving grace was the Kurobuta grilled pork done to perfection.

I was here with friends to have a late lunch after having big breakfasts in the morning. We ordered dimsum and some soups at 4 PM. At first we didn't expect that they still serve lunch at such hour. The service also good but not so friendly. However, the food came fast, we really enjoyed it

Actually we wanted to have decent Chinese dinner. The restaurant was just at the first impression a really bad joke. It feels like a Chinese buffet at a rail station with people passing by and a lot of noise around you. The service was horrible, we ordered two soups as a starter, the first was served, the second arrived ten minutes later. The waiter explained the menu with the charme of a bored bad taste diner service person. We left this horrible place after the soups.

We ate here on four occasions during our stay at Marina Bay Sands.It is well located in the lobby level/ground floor of MBS. It is located mid-way between the three towers. It is spaciously laid out with elegant Asian dÃ©cor and the largest faux rice pots you've every seen in your life!All the food that we ate over our visits was tasty and well presented, generous size portions and we enjoyed good service.Shout out to one of the male servers named Eue who looked after us exceptionally well one of the evening meals.The restaurant offers a broad selection of foods, the menu was extensive and the operating hours are also beyond the average lunch and dinner times so we were able to get food almost anytime of the day.A good restaurant and we would definitely visit again if staying at MBS

The restaurant has good presentation: location, seating arrangement, table cloth, napkins, and that's about it.It was early afternoon and appeared to be nice place for lunch. Unfortunately we were told by waitress with a grim face "dim sum" only, no exceptions. How about soup? "Shark fin only". That took care of the soup. The dim sum selection was very short. We ordered three dishes and two were good (shrimp with bird nest and steamed prawns) but it took long time to get them and the portions were small. The third, spare ribs, was awful: 70% bone, 20% fat and 10% meat tough like sole of my sneakers. Is evening now and still can't get it out from between my teeth. Spare ribs supposed to come with plum sauce and when I asked about that I got a smirk / semi smile (the very first one) informing me that the plum sauce was there.Perhaps the waitress was pissed off because I didn't order recommended "Chinese tea" but cold water without ice instead (it was over 90 degrees outside with matching humidity). The glasses with water were small and not free but substantially less than the tea.The bill was steep and we left hungry

Wife and I went for dinner on our last night in Singapore. We were pointedly ignored when we tried to place our order. We had to ask twice before the order was taken. Soup arrived very quickly. Excellent presentation average flavour. Next dishes arrived very soon after. Poor presentation. Food just dropped off. The pricing is top end which is not reflected in the taste and definitely not in the service
