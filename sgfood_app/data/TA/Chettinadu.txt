They serve home food exactly, following traditions by serving in banana leaf. Make one feels at home and their Bru coffee is a must try.

This is a restaurant were locals go.
Nothing fancy, just honest, fresh and tasteful food for great price.
The staff is friendly and the owner is proud to have tourists in his restaurant :-).
Great place !

Chandler street is where Indian Singaporeans go. This place is open to the street, clean enough, good biryani, also Roti , Uttapam etc. My partner had mutton, which was "pretty good", all in all, very good and excellent value

We ran into this a bit by accident - it's one block off what appears to be the main drag in Little India. The visual is open cafe style but it wasn't buffet so we decided to try it out. Good call on that!We ordered a biryani and took the manager's advice on pepper chicken. They started with a banana leaf for the plate - first time for me on that - and then started serving food from bowls. I'm a hot temperature for food freak and was hoping the food was still hot. Amazingly, everything that was served was piping hot (not overly spicy hot). There was rice, two vegetable dishes, a raita, and the main dish - along with some other supporting characters. The first bit of the bean dish was perfect. Great flavor, enough heat to make you sweat a bit but not the kind that makes you want to die. Same on the second veggie dish. My main pepper chicken was awesome. Again, right amount of heat in the food but not the kind that has you lunging for the nearest water source. Perfect balance. The raita, at first glance with a lot of onions made me wonder if it would be too much. But it was not. Honestly, everything that was food in this serving was flavorful, spicy to where you appreciate the heat but not a 10 on the scale - just amazingly good. Many of the people in the restaurant were eating with their fingers - but the manager was on his game and brought forks without asking for us. :) Not that we would have been opposed to fingers - it was just easier! The good use of fingers was that the chicken had bones - no big deal - but made a bit of an effort to pull it apart. The good news was the chicken quality was very good.Total bill for two was $18 SGD with two cokes and more food than we could eat. I would put this on my list of places to visit for excellent food taste at amazing value. Nothing like finding a place like this and watching the smiles on the employee's faces when you tell them how good it is

A local friend took us here for dinner last night-I was amazed at the variety we got for $10 Singapore each. Unlimited rice, various condiments and a gravy of our choice, then we shared 4 small plates of various dry curries-chicken was tasty but over cooked to my taste, mutton was delicious and I have to admit not tasting the trip or the liver one (my husband said it was dry). Waiters were attentive topping up rice and more condiments and bringing out breads for us to try. All in all lots of fun and I'm told way more authentic than the touristic places we passed to get to i

Cheap and nice. I love going here coz its affordable. I mean its a normal shop with generally good service. But the taste is more authentic than any of the high cost overated restaurants in Race course road. get your south indian food fix here. Special recommendation got to be 'kodel' (goat intestines)

This is like eating in any Chettiar cafe offering food in the districts of Tamil Nadu. For a moment you can forget that you are in Singapore. The best part is you get to experience simple and authentic tamilian food at prices cheaper than the ones charged in Chennai. The place is always buzzing with people so you need to draw the attention of the busy waiters who are hovering from table to table. If you are on a budget, but very hungry and looking for good quality food..... Don't look anywhere else

The food is great. The selection is fantastic, and the high volume of people means the food is constantly being cooked and is fresh.Broad selection of meat and seafood.The staff are generous and friendly, without being salesy (like Anjappa). The roving trays of rice, veggie and sambar etc. is a great system - Singapore needs more places like this. The only thing I would change is to add more (than the current 3) vegetable options. Other than that - Love it

I love this place and go there every once in a while. I always have the same thing, meals with chicken 65 or their fish fry. Both excellent. And the serve staff is great and will keep insisting you eat more. Ha! The place is designed for people in a rush. Come in, sit down, get a banana leaf spread in front of you, meals served. In and out

The portions were generous and filling. Good place for a brunch before a long day. one of the numerous eateries in Little India.

Tuck in a small lane behind the main road. This restaurant serves 1 of the very good indian food in Little India. You can choose to eat with hands or cutlery. Reasonable pricing and really good food with free flow of rice, curry and condiments.

We were going to Gandhi for South Indian food and it was closed for the day, decided to stick to this restaurant just like usual . It is the choice place if Gandhi is closed . Must say that the waiters are helpful and friendly , the food was okay , that's the reason to write about thus restaurant . The fish curry was delightful as the chicken curry was not ready yet. The masala chicken is good comparable to gandhis . I will recommend that give this place a try , u might like it too as we d

If you've never had a curry served on a banana leaf, then this is one of the best places to go for it. Authentic Indian curry and you can choose whatever you want from the buffet style display. Not expensive either, two curries for around 15 Singapore dollars. The chicken is on the bone, but tasty, and it came with 2 vegetable curries, rice and poppadoms. They are not licensed for alcohol.

We sat down a bit uncomfortable with upset stomachs and asked for boiled rice and black tea. The waiter then went out of his way to take care of us. He brought some delicious broth to mix with the rice, and some buttermilk 'sure to cure your stomachs' (we didn't dare to try but greatly appreciated the gesture). We got the rice with naan bread, black tea & a pitcher of water - it was delicious, and all together only SGD 10,-.Price and service were of old fashioned quality. A wonderful experience far above expectations

Going where the crowd was, my Indian friend brought me here to taste the more home style cuisine. I liked seeing the workers lined up to select their dishes from the display, that meant food here was good. Of course my friend said he kept coming here. Perfect if you're vegetarian, though the carnivores can select a nice crab, fish meatball or mutton biryani to add to their meal. Try the nice lassi also!Unfortunately no desserts available, go elsewhere if needing this fix

I often visited this place when I was in tekka (little India). It's a well known place and the food is really good. The price is reasonable. My only criticism is that the place gets quite crowded very easily so it's better to call and enquire about the space availability. Recommend this place to all.
