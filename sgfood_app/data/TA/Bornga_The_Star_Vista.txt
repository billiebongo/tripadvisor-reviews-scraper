The food at Bornga never fails to disappoint! The marinated pork was very delicious and tender and the thinly sliced beef was equally good! Love the spread of vegetables to wrap the meat in as well (:
5
The waiters are kind and efficient. The staff that barbeque the meat for us were very friendly and it made our experience in this restaurant memorable.
5
The food is amazing! The food takes me back to my Korea trip I had last month! Recommend coming here for the BBQ
5
The food was great, has the korean feel in the restaurant itself. The dishes are all authentic foods, would love to come again!
4
Seafood pancake was good. Ginseng chicken was not as tender as those i had tried. The aircon not cold . Service is good.
5
"Best korean bbq ever" very athentic korean dishes.. And awesome customer service well definitely come backüôåüëç

The food was not as usual, but i am quite disappointed about the service. We went into the restaurant and was brought to a table which it‚Äôs bbq stove was partially broken. It was constantly giving full blast of flames and as we would like to have our meal as our own pace rather than to cook everyone at one go, we asked for it to turned down. That is then we knew that it‚Äôs broken. We didn‚Äôt complain or make any angry remark but I just thought it would be nice to inform us in advance before giving us that table. It was not even half full with guests when we first arrive the restaurant.

Had a wonderful dinner at Bornga in Star Vista with my family on Sunday, 11 Feb. Other than the food being of high quality, I have to applaud the serving staff who were prompt, efficient and friendly. We were especially impressed by the server Ivy who managed to communicate and engage well with my daughter. We will definitely be back again as our family, especially my daughter enjoyed her dinner there.

We went to this place 2 times at Star Vista. At first it tasted amazing for us, free flow vegetable and all the side dishes. Cool! But at the 2nd time we went there, we found that the taste was a bit too sweet and boring to us (maybe too sweet). Because of the sweetness, all tasted the same. The staff are friendly, the price is pretty ex.
5
Combination of good food and great service, all smiles with korean greeting and as you sit they welcome you by serving barley tea... appreciate that they do bbq for us... good place to keep on our first choice of korean resto... so far best in town
2
Reservation not known... unpleasant attitude from manager on Duty on 13 oct. Restaurant was extremely short handed.
5
Nice korean restaurant at starvista. Love the seafood soup and side dishes. Soup is rich in taste and price is reasonable considering free flow of side dishes and green tea.
4
Friendly staff always willing to help! Although understaffed at times can tell that they always putting in their best efforts.
5
Good food! Great service! The side dishes were really nice... a lot of veggies... it was worth the price... surely will come back again and again...
4
If u want to avoid the dinner crowd on weekdays, go to Bornga at Star Vista. It is relatively quiet, and the food there is good.
4
Took a while to get seated, to get our food and to get the bill. The food is ok but the wait made the experience unmemorable
4
Review by Dr Sim. Korean BBQ food is quite good. Service is acceptable. Quite good ventilation so you do not smell of BBQ. Enjoyed meal. However a bit pricey. Regards Dr Sim
3
There is a $1 charge to the wet tissue provided, if we are a party of 6 that would be an extra $6 to the bill which is too expensive.
2
Hi, the woo Sam gyup is the star dish but the meat had too much fat. Staff are busy and it seemed that management deliberately understaffed this branch. We could takeaway food that we ordered but could not finish. Hope there is improvement as I am there every week
4
Been there first time, food is good and quite expensive . However there has set dinner with different combination of pork or beef BBQ. Food quality is good, service is superb and attentive . The only challenge is the smoke exhaust system is not too effective and also the aircon is not cold enough to eat BBQ
3
We need to wait for longggg before the ice green tea is served. maybe due to crowd and under staff...
3
Thumb Up : Variety of fresh vegetables for eat with BBQ meat. Marinated meat quite good. The waiter also help to baberque the meat.
Thumb Down: Limited dishes selection.
3
Food was alright, most average at most. Service wasn't excellent either. Quite overpriced I would say.
4
food was superb, high quality and huge serving. the auntie who served us was good at cooking the meat, but a little too talkative. she was also hinting us for staying too long, which really spoil the whole visit
2
The staff members were very hurried in their movements making the experience of dining there unpleasant. Felt hassled to finish food fast.
One portion of beef was not fresh. Vegetables were more charred rather than grilled.
4
Set meal for two was just right, price and food portion plus shoju.
Extra veg & kimchi on request. Friend & efficient staff.
Happy with the experience.
4
Food choices were a little limited, but they taste really good. Quiet and nice atmosphere. Recommended!

We made a booking for 8 pax. When we arrived we realized that we were made to squeeze into a table for 6. The advice given was that there isn't a table meant for 8, that should have been highlighted when I make the reservation. Aircon seems to be non existence, very humid and hot and stuffy. To make matters worst, aircon ducts above us was dripping water and when we highlight to the staff, they took a mop stick and started cleaning the duct and causing more water to drop into us and the table. One male staff seems to be very apologetic but can't help much, we are thankful for his assistance to shift us to another table after 30mins. In addition, the place is severely under staff, we have to get our own water and utensils. This is the last time I will go to this outlet.

Went to Bornga at Star Vista several times as my dad likes the place and the service of this particular staff (can't recall his name but he's the only elderly staff amongst the younger service staff there who helps customers BBQ their food). We usually order beef bulgogi, kurobuta pork, beef prime ribs, kimchi seafood toufu soup and chap chay. The restaurant is very generous in their servings of fresh green lettuces for you to eat with the BBQ meat. You can ask for more if you want. The appetizers are also good, though I find the kimchi slightly too spicy for me. They also serve a very interesting sour cold soup which I find refreshing and their salad dressing is yummy too. Overall I like Bornga and this is probably my favourite Korean restaurant in Singapore. Ask for uncle to help you cook. He is very friendly and cooks the meat to perfection. His service is top notch!! The only "flaw" of this place is that you smell like BBQ meat after your meal.
4
I had lunch with a friend here because I couldn't resist the lunch deals! I'm already a fan of Bornga, but the lunch deals made me love it even more. The Japchae was AMAZING and definitely worth every penny - I'd have it even if I had to pay full price for it! The service at this outlet though, isn't as great as the others (that's why I'm giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5) - the waitress looked really unhappy to be serving us, but then again, it may just be a lunch crowd thing.
4
Food delicious, good service but noticed they had changed their menu to lesser choice, no chicken meat for BBQ.
5
Bornga is really the. The thin beef is so good and the pork belly with soya sauce is a real winner :) I love the kimchee soup too. Great stuff here :)
5
Welcome with a table of side dishes and the presentation of the main dishes were interesting:) big eaters should be gladden by the portions or shared among the small eaters. End with a fruity soju for a relaxed mood!
4
Prompt customer service and good value. If time permits must try BBQ! Else bibimbap and seafood pancake are great choices too!
3
Had an informal lunch meeting and I asked for a quiet place - they accommodated my request, and they subsequently did not let new customers sit near me as well - appreciate that!!
4
Well, meat is the key. Meat is good, but the waiter cooked slightly too Long so the meat turn a bit tough. Most of the dishes are decent, great for dining with family.
3
Had some expectations for Bornga before I came but sadly the food tasted pretty average. Given the price I'm paying, it's not really worth another visit. The steamed egg was burnt as well...sadly.
4
Not nice greeting at all. Grouchy men staff. But my lady Aunty who took our orders & cooked for us is the Best Staff. She's so funny and we felt very happy and certainly enjoyed our dinner. But at payment again the grouchy skinny bespectacled chap. Food is very good and of course your clothes stink badly after. The exhaust is useless actually as compared to Seoul restaurants. The whole restaurant stank, especially near the kitchen. The older staff are very friendly.
4
As new to Korean food I was convinced by a colleague to try the Bibimbap dish which made me turn into to a fan as from now. The dish is cooked and served in a clay pot with rice at the bottom, vegetables and meat on top and the yoke of an egg in the middle. It is served (very) hot and you actually need to mix the ingredients in the pot, you will notice it is still cooking while you mix everything up. It was a very positive debut for me into Korean food and I will very much try the dish in other Korean places as from now.The restaurant is good for large or small groups and has the more classic Korean dishes like meat marinades on the grill which looked very tasty. Prices are good according to Singapore standards
3
We asked for side dishes (as commonly given at Bornga at Vivocity) but our waiter at The Star Vista branch informed us that they do not give side dishes unless customers order a main dish (apart from BBQ dishes). He did offer us some kimchi though. We find this a strange practice as Korean restaurants anywhere in the world do offer side dishes. This is why people like going to Korean restaurants in the first place I guess.
4
Love the ambience and the service. Lots of vegetables for your order and lastly, they really do up the meat well for you. Unless you love to cook your own meat, this is one of the best options I have been.
4
Good food. We could do with more smiley waiters but response was quite quick though. Overall, I would still recommend.
5
The korean BBQ is nice. Both tje signature sliced pork and beef steak are nice. They provide good table service to help to BBQ the meet. We have a really good time there.
4
We ordered pork, beef and prawn. The beef and prawn is great. Pork is a bit tough though. Serving of veggie is generous. Taste of kimchi can be improved.
3
Had the budaejjigae (army stew) and japchae, which was quite a lot for two pax. Food standard wasn't fantastic and not worth the price paid for (have had better Korean authentic food). Haven't tried the bbq before but I wouldn't recommend the budaejjigae!
5
Good value for money. Comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, good service and no lingering smell on clothes after being in restaurant for more than 1 hour.
4
Date with a girl friend at Star Vista...since she work at Holland Village, there are one stop MRT Circle Line. Wait her till 9pm. We go in 9:10pm, revel counter informed us, last order 9:30pm, as we decided order Pork BBQ with Kimchi Pork Rib Hotpot and two 350ml Korean Beer. Nice place. Will go again. Service and GST 10%+7%. BBQ serve by them.

Came here for a birthday celebration with the family, overall quite a nice feel to it, here's the breakdown:Ambience: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Customer Service: 4.5/5Quality of Food: 4/5Value for Money: 4/5Our Orders: Gyeran Jim (Hotspot Egg): 4/5Woo Samyup (BBQ Beef): 5/5Samyupsal in Soy Sauce (BBQ Pork): 4/5Samyetang (Ginseng Chicken): 3.5/5Mansinchang Samgyeopsal: 4/5Teo San Tteokgalbi: 3/5Haemul Pa Jeon: 4/5The Good: Nice ambience, customer service is quite friendly and detailed, food is not bad, one of the better Korean restaurants, the Woo Samyup is simply marvellous! Must try it! Food maybe a bit pricey for some, but they give a very generous portion, so it works out well. The Bad: I expected more for all the marketing and price, still given that the place was quite quiet with a zesty life to it, I find it quite alright. Bottom Line: Do come here with a group and celebrate the Woo Samyup dish, I can see that a lot of effort was put in to make this dish excellent! Hope that dishes can have that extra X factor, the marketing is really very good, I look forward to something special being added to the dishes the next time I visit!

I saw this restaurant sign on my way to work. As this one is my favourite bbq chains in Korea, I went to have lunch right away on that day. The best part of this restaurant is the special sauce and vegetables. It is served just like it is in Korea. I love the big plate of vegetables. The server stands right next to you and cooks the meat for you so it can be cooked well. It wasn't cheap for lunch. It was almost 50SGD as I order bbq set that comes out with kimchi soup. Next time, I will just order the bbq meat. Kimchi soup was so so. Not worthy. I believe the bbq was around 30 (17% of service & GST will be charged on top of that
3
Had dinner here with my family.We ordered two cuts of beef and one of pork for the BBQ. They served an assortment of fresh vegetables and side dishes together with the meat.We were surprised that the staff actually cook the meat for you at your table; basically we didn't have to do anything. However we felt that they grilled the meat for too long, as a result the beef became a little too tough.Overall the food tasted OK, but we felt that the price was expensive
3
Food was great (except the "signature" egg dish), unfortunately marred by impolite service. Egg was charred and bitter, but when told, service staff said it was meant to be that way, that even if they replaced, it would be the same.
5
Called to delay my reservation n was well arranged. Good service. Nice food - weekday set lunch. Worth!
3
Went to the star theatre to watch a concert, pass by the korean restaurant friend want to try.
Food presentation was okay, but food does not have the mm taste as their staff wore t shirt saying original korean taste.
3
Overall is ok. But some how the entire restaurant is quite smelly because of the smoke in the air conditioner environment
4
Good place for mini gathering with friends. Nice food and good service. Price reasonable with the portion given.
3
We had our usual ladies weekly lunch and decided to try a new Korean place. The restaurant was clean and casual. The set lunches were good value and taste was decent but nothing amazing. The service was friendly. Maybe next time we will try the chef's specialty meats.
4
I have never eaten at a proper Korean bbq before, so i don't know the 'usual price' out there, but for the quantity we ordered, it was slightly too expensive. ($30-40 for 3 slices of meat)For the bbq, there is a employee that will help you cook the meat and cut it up. The lady that served us was super nice and remembered to ask how cooked we wanted the meat. Unfortunately, one of our beef set was slightly overcooked. (we wanted half cooked/medium) Still, it was an interesting experience, having someone cook at our table for us! The meal does come with quite a few side dishes and a huge spread of veggies to use to wrap the meat with. Don't think I will return to this restaurant as it is too expensive. The meat was yummy though
5
The BBQ meat comes with a HUGE plate of assorted vegetables that go really well with the meat! The thinly sliced beef (which is their signature) was really delicious. The korean side dishes like kimchi radish were also very savoury and lovely. Seafood tofu soup was really yummy and the naengmyun (cold noodles) were refreshing and good! Overall, really loved the food (
3
like the title suggests best galbitang in singapore. I've tasted a couple of Korean places and nothing beats the galbitang at bornga. but then again, the food is pricey. their set lunches are a good deal and definitely worth visiting just to get the soups at a steal. don't expect much from service. been to this outlet twice and the manager always seems as though we owe him money. on the first occasion to bornga, there was a super attentive server (sorry didn't get his name). but on the second visit he was not around, and service was way worse than before. I will go back during lunch just for galbitang and steamed egg. but only during lunch.
3
Of all the dishes that were ordered, the fried seafood rice cake received thumbs up. The dessert drink was a refreshing way to end off the meal especially after eating spicy stuff. The meat portion goes by grams and is costly. The service staff recommended a grilled meat dish using their own marinades. Wasn't anything to shout about. Even the side dishes weren't fantastic. We were even served with a chipped off bowl. However, the service staff was attentive to our needs
1
Terrible service, insensitive staff, unnecessarily loud kitchen/washers - overall foodcourt vibe. Presented with the bill in the middle of the meal, 45mins before closing time. Average food (overpriced for the quality), meat not fresh / frozen. Drinks served days from expiry date.
3
The usual standard Korean food, served in this Food Chain. Quality of food was solid and tasteful. Lunch options for SGD12.90. Service is OK, but not better.
3
Nothing particularly outstanding at all... Average food in a nicer setting? Service staff were a little slow too...
3
Dine at Bornga for the second time. Overall the food was ok but a little bit pricey. If you are dining. There is a minimum requirement to order 2 BBQ dishes. Lots of Vegetables and Ghim Chee provided. Love the woo samgyup since most people order this.Good atmosphere and ok service. Avoid weekends. Recalled that our family have been waiting more than an hour to get a table. Try big mama Korean. They are definitely better. We are crafting for Korean. We came hew last night because it was the nearest to our resident. Nothing else. Will consider if we want to come here again.... Restaurant should work out some kind of discount, privileges. Hard to have repeat customer without good loyalty program and service
3
Overall experience was ok, nothing to get crazy about.Salad, sides and meat was from good quality but the staff should get better trained how to bbq it so quality will not suffer while cooking. Also not all of the staff are attentive unfortunately. Anyway we were in good company of our friends and made the best out of it
1
Had dinner at this Star Vista outlet for the 1st time and probably will be my last time there. Food was below par, service sucks and the place was just too smoky. Just not recommended. Side dishes that they have was pathetic, 3 dishes of raw salad (not kidding), 1 dish of kimchi, 1 cold soup, 1 dish of bean sprouts, 1 dish of anchovies and that's about it. Probably the least number of side dishes I had in a Korean restaurant and one with the most no. of salads as side dishes. The male staff whom I think is Korean had a black face throughout while grilling the meats for us. Worst part was the meat was overcooked and most of them were charred. Had to spend time to scrap off the burnt parts and as expected the meat was too dry. The same male staff also double up as our cashier. Totally not a single word was spoken to us not even a "thank you". Seriously Bornga needs to retrain their staff and at least put someone who knows how to grill meats and not burn them
2
Service was okay but we realised that we were not served some of the side dishes, and how can a Korean restaurant not have kimchi side dish!? We only had 3 side dishes: radish, lettuce salad and green onions. Not sure if it's normal but we saw other tables with more side dishes. The meat dishes were so-so only. The only saving point was that the meat and veg are fresh. Disappointing
3
Like all others korean barbecue restaurant, Bornga has similar ambience when you enter the restaurant. You can smell all meats burnt in charcoal grills. If only eating there wasn‚Äôt so knackering. Gosh but there‚Äôs a lot of admin with Korean food. Everything has to be dredged or dipped and rolled and dipped again. Fiddle here. Turn there. Flip thisThe Dawaeji gohchuujang bbq (spicy pork fire-grilled) was hard and dry. We also had the Woo samgyup (thinly sliced beef brisket dressed with born-ga‚Äôs special sauce). Marbled with connective tissue and fat, it‚Äôs damn difficult to cook brisket so that it‚Äôs tender yet moist and flavoursome. I swear blind by the superior Yangnyum dwaeji galbi (chewy pork ribs marinated with special house sauce to create an enhanced taste). Once you order other dishes ‚Äî especially barbecue ‚Äî you risk being inundated with so many plates you won‚Äôt be able to pay the haemul pajeon (pancake made from scallions n a variety of seafood) the attention it deservesThe busy restaurant took its toll on the staff, who weren‚Äôt as efficient as some other such restaurant we‚Äôve been. Bornga wasn‚Äôt on top form, but it certainly still draws a crowd. This is the true truth as I say it as it is‚Ä¶(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

The house specialty beef and pork belly,, were well marinated and presented, but destroyed by the service staff during the griling process. Either charred or overcooked, and with all the juices gone to waste! The rest of of the food (seafood pancake, naengmyun, bibimbab) was mediocre. Definitely not worth the hype or a repeat visit
4
Of course, one comes out this grill restaurant smelling like BBQ. And the place is popular so one must come early for the lunch service or be prepared to wait for a table. However, the woo samgyup (28SGD for 200g) is a winner. It is served with a variety of lettuce, spring onions, freshly sliced garlic and two bbq sauces. One can order steamed rice and a seafood stew that goes excellently with the woo samgyup or plainly with rice. The meals include appetizers of pickled vegetables like kimchi, and is capped with a serving of cold omija (five-flavor berry) drink that cleanses the palate.My family enjoyed each of the five times we've eaten in the Vivo City branch in the last two years, and we will eat there again the next time we are in Singapore.The Filipino servers are particularly kind and warm
