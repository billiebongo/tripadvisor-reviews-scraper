Food's great, lots of variety, be careful to avoid lunchtime rush hour. Finding a table can be problematic.
Great atmosphere, fun experience.
Number 75 bus from 1 Raffles gets you there.

Good spread of selections. However the food court closes rather early.

My favorite Singapore mee pok and fish ball soup in Sim Lim food court is my traditional homeage in Singapore for more than 10 years. Everytime, I visit Singapore I must go to this Mee Pok stall; (2nd stall on you left) as you entry the food court is one of the best in Singapore. All Singapore visitors must try. I hope this introduction will not affect my private sercet food hole. Anyway, I am getting old (68) and wish someone can take over my favourite
