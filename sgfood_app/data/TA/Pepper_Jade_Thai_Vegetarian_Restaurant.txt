Some dishes were a little salty but generally quite good.
I thought this place was a vegetarian place (friend was vegetarian, not me) but they have meat/seafood options ...so it caters for all tastes.
I think the cuisine is Thai / Thai-Chinese.

I'm not sure if it's authentic Thai, seems somewhat fusion of Thai and Chinese. But it was really good, beyond my expectation. No wonder it was full house when we had dinner there. The seating is really pack though.

6 delicious dishes with drinks for 4 persons come up to S$126.76 is definitely worthwhile with excellent service. Gave up great recommendation and milk iced tea with coconut milk is really special - not in the menu with outstanding taste! Try it.

It's seriously understaffed. Food in 45mins. Simple water takes 30mins to come despite asking the waiter 6times, his reply is very busy no chance to serve. Food agreed is good but quite costly. Need to hire more staff and make the food faster

We were hosting a farewell dinner for a large group and decided on Pepper Jade since some of our group are vegetarians. I'm not a vegetarian but I was pleasantly surprised with the authentic Thai tasting dishes including coconut thai "fish" paste (locally we call it otah otah), tom yum soup, thai green curry and desserts. Despite the dishes being vegetarian, I found it filling and tasty.The staff were attentive and accommodating especially since there are different vegetarian requirements from our group.... some can't handle milk or milk.. some can't consumer garlic, chilli etc.I regularly visit vegetarian restaurants in Singapore and glad to see that prices are quite affordable especially for a large group.Make sure you order the brown rice to go with your dishes, its quite different from the brown rice served in other veg restaurants, maybe its a special import for Pepper Jad

Pepper Jade serves Thai cuisine in vegetarian style.And vegetarian cuisine can be VERY TASTY.I would like to recommend Green Curry, Broccoli Abalone, Deep Fried Abalone Mushroom, Stir Fired Kai Lan and Tom Kha Kai (i.e. whole coconut milky soup).For dessert, Mango Sticky Rice is fresh and yummy.Staff are attentive and friendly. Non-vegetarian will definitely appreciate these meatless dishes too

Pepper Jade Thai Vegetarian Cuisine, located first floor in the Sunshine Plaza building Bencoolen St. The restaurant is small with simple ambience. It offers the best full Thai cuisine in vegetarian style, which is seldom found in Singapore. Must Tries, Tom Yam in Claypot, Tang Hoon Prawn in Claypot, Green Curry, and Pad Thai .The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. The food is beyond expectations. On the whole a must try for all vegetarians

Visited pepper jade thai vegan restaurant. Best thing is that they do not even use onion garlic. Starters and salad are great. Try green mango salad... main course has lot of varieties including noodles and rice. Though desserts looked attractive, we were full. Service is friendly. They may want to avoid mock meat names... not really required. If you like thai food and are pure vegan or vegetarian... then this is the restaurant to visit.... minus the meat names on the menu. Seriously, its a turn off. Why would i want to eat chicken/ pork/ beef ( mock) in a vegetarian restaurant ? Otherwise, great place

Food is average but really expensive. Tom yam soup cost $14 for one person's share and not accompanied with rice. White rice cost $2 separately. Small portion and average taste. 2 small bowls of appetizers were charged for $5 before our prior knowledge. The desserts served did not match the photos (short of ingredients shown on photo), and when queried, it was laughed off and brushed aside with the excuse - this is Thai style. The pandan chendol was at most a cup of diluted coconut water with a few shreds of ingredients. Again, was told it's Thai style. We visited with a group of friends that we have not met for a while, hence a lot to catch up on while eating. Staff are generally friendly and helpful. However, one particular waitress was too chatty, and kept interrupting us when:1) we were trying to discuss what we wanted to order (to force her opinions on us of what to and how much to order); 2) we were eating and catching up with each other (with her own stories and questions)There were also small roaches and were told to leave them alone. Not even an apology! Will not return!

Their fish cake and mango rice were nice. That's all. The tom yam soup didn't taste as good as the one we had in Thailand even they claimed that their chef was from Thailand. To be honest, we won't patron the shop if we are not vegetarian and we find no reason to go back again.

Nice restaurant which is centrally located in Sunshine Plaza.
Lots of choices .... The chilli is good for most of the dishes.
Recommendation: Mee Goreng, pineapple rice, tom yam soup, green curry....
Order their lemon grass drink either hot or cold.... very nice.

Tried their pineapple fired rice, green curry and their thai fish cake.
All dishes did not disappoint me, especially the fired rice.
Will return for more good food!

For a foodie country, it is a breath of fresh air to go vegetarian once in a while. The Thai vegetarian food was scrumptious! The mock duck. fish were excellent. Food was well price and portions were good. Definitely go again! My family enjoyed the food very much!They have a sister restaurant on the same floor TENG Japanese vegetarian food. Looking forward to try it out

I am sure it's tough to be a pure vegetarian Thai place and one of its kind - and thus this place deserves kudos for that The food overall was average - we tried 4 items and 2 made the mark (tom kha and Pandan chicken) while the others were average at best Service wise they strive hard and ambience is nice - and thus deserve a second visit - hopefully the other items we taste will improve our opinion

Clean and Cozy place. The staffs are very friendly and the foods are delicious. Portion of food is reasonable. The food display is colourful and looks very appetizing.But had hard time looking for the place as there's no signboard display outside the restaurant. Overall experience is good. Will visit again

Glad to find this restaurant @ Sunshine Plaza alongside two other Thai restaurants. But this is vegetarian and still has a great variety on the menu. We had Pad thai, Olive Rice and a Tofu appetizer- all were full of flavor, very good serving size and easy on the pocket. Even though its a small restaurant , but decor is quite nice and service very professional. We were asked a couple of times how we found the food. My 3 yr old also loved the tofu and mango with sticky rice(main course for him). Will definitely go bac

It is not easy to find a vegetarian Thai restaurant in Singapore. We were glad to find Pepper Jade. Most of the dishes are very delicious, especially the Tom Yam soup (if you can take spicy food), the Claypot tang hoon and the olive fried rice. We also like the son-in-law eggs. They charge $0.50 for plain water. Most of the staff were friendly except for the lady supervisor

Situated at Sunshine Plaza facing a crossed road junction, which is directly opposite Fortune Centre. Nearest train station; BUGIS. 5mins walk from train station. Varieties of choices. Price moderate. Patrons can hv a selection of the level of spiciness in the curry. Nice ambience. They hv two separate units. One is situated away fr d kitchen; much quieter. D other unit is d main one with all d hustling fr d kitchen. No round table available. Situated at ground floor making wheelchair accessible
