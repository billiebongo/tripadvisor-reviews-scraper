This was my third visit the NP. The food has be less impressive every time. Bland and non differienciated.

Staff kindness, variety of food and drinks....If you wanna relax, have fun, meet friends, after work or during holiday.I spent fantastic time here and people is great.Awesome moments. I definitely recommend her
5
Awesome night at Neon Pigeon enjoying the great food and fantastic cocktails! Corbin looked after us really well and we'll definitely be back again :
5
Went with a friend on a Saturday night for drinks and dinner. We were not sure what was good and Andrew took the initiative to recommend their popular dishes. Food turned out to be great! Loved their hummus and crab pao! Service was prompt and attentive even though the place was packed. Definitely will be back again.
4
I stumbled across this restaurant one hot night. The air con is good and the staff are relaxed and confident. They know their stuff. Moody lighting and warehouse chic make this unlike other Singapore experiences. The food is fresh and creative and the cocktails excellent.
5
Been to Neon Pigeon for a few times. Absolutely loved their Soft Shell Crab Bao, definitely a must try everytime I am there. I can finish 4 by myself. Other than the Bao, the other food worth taking note of are the bone marrow as well as the grilled asparagus. They have interesting Japanese inspired cocktails as well. Other than the food and drinks, the reason why I am always back is the service they provide. They don't treat me as just their customer, but as their Friend and will really take care of our needs. Highly recommended.

We went on a Saturday night. The ambience was lively and i liked the music they played. The service was attentive and the food can be described as japanse tapas. The food is good for sharing. I can not remember the exact names of the dishes but we liked the curry wurst, the Brussel sprouts, the salad and the baby racks. The bone marrow we ate was oke I guess it's something you need to appreciate. Definitely a restaurant I would recommend and visit again.
4
Only stopped for a cocktail in the singapore heat, had a cocktail very refreshing, great bar menu with interesting drinks, worth a vist if in Chinatown
5
Sensational Venue, Amazing Flavours, Great Ambiance....Super Friendly Staff. Bar Staff Deliver The Most Delicious Cocktail
3
Nice ambience and great service. Some dishes were great but some were average. Cocktail presentation was nice but taste could be improved on
4
I wont call it Japanese food, asian fusion probably the right thing to call it. . everything we ate taste fantastic, the cocktails as well. Staff were very friendly, but the place were too small. I would come back again with a smaller group :
5
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, Asian fusion tapas if that makes sense. Great dished and great cocktails, very lively but also intimate atmosphere. Can also come for just a drink at the bar. Reasonable prices
5
You've got to visit this place solely for a bartender by the name of Kai and the appetizers (hummus chips
5
*****Sensational food and service, can’t wait to return! Most fabulous recommendation. Every dish was incredible. *****
5
Best dinner in a long time. Great service . Best dinner in a long time. Great service . Best dinner in a long time. Great service
5
I have been there with boring feeling. Kudos to bartender here who can male me feel better via the made-to-order cocktail.Pricey but worth to pay
4
Almost every item is delicious. The cocktails are great too. Just that the seats on the high chairs are uncomfortable
5
We walked in without a booking and scored a seat at the bar with no waiting.... from there it was pure magic, we ordered cocktails and food from a delicious menu and weren’t disappointed. The bar staff were super friendly and chatted to us as we watched them do their magic mixing amazing cocktails. The food came out super quick and was inhaled enthusiastically whilst the bar staff poured us shots of Sake to wash it all down. We’ll be back again soon

This was my 3rd time to Neon Pigeon and I specifically wanted to take an out-of-town guest here for a fun and funky atmosphere. Maybe it's been a while since I've been out, but this just wasn't a fun place anymore. The other guests were considerably older. Service was average - the waiters/waitresses seemed to overcomplicate every request and order. Food was good but just not decent portion sizes
5
Had a great experience dining in Neon Pigeon. Food were all on point, 3 of us shared around 11 dishes. Favourite of the night is the Bone Marrow and Asparagus. Service was quite efficient as well.
5
It suits me perfectly being able to order small plates of practically everything. Everything is just too damn delicious to only have one or two plates.
5
Food was excellent, amazing drinks and friendly customer service. If you have the budget, try everything on the menu.
5
This place is just fantastic. The food never disappoints, the service is always good and the ambiance is great any night of the week. Highly recommend
4
Ambiance was what I expected. Service was generally good throughout, with menus, taking orders, refilling drinks on point. Food had hits and misses, with the meat dishes disappointing. The duck confit and the pork was overly salty. To be fair, the seafood was wonderful and would definitely come back for that. Passed on drinks that night.
5
Enjoyed 7 amazing dishes at Neon Pigeon and 4 delicious cocktails. They also have a solid selection of sake. Hummus and baby back ribs were definitely two standout dishes. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Great atmosphere. Loved every aspect of it!!
5
One of my all-time favorite spots in Singapore. Fantastic food, wide array of drinks, and always a great crowd/ambiance. The manager Andrew is top caliber and his staff is some of the best that I've encountered on this little island. Five stars without a doubt
5
Delicious food and great service! Only the music is a bit too loud.. You should definitely pass by to try the hummus and duck confit 
4
Neon Pigeon serves great cocktails and good food, though a little pricey, but it was worth it. Ambience is great for friends gathering, maybe not suitable for a romantic date as it can get a little bit noisy once the crowd is in
5
Wow. Neon Pigeon is a high energy Japanese Fusion restaurant in the outskirts of Chinatown in Singapore. The Roasted bone marrow is a stand out winner. The soft shell crab Bao was fantastic too. Sushi was awesome. Cocktails are the mainstream here and a limited but good wine list.
4
It’s my 5th time here and the food never disappoints. The soft shell crab man tou is my favourite! The sauce and soft shell crab together with then man tou is simply awesome! However, the pork belly and pork rib is abit if a disappointment. Seasoning on the Pork ribs taste abit strange and we did not really like it. If you are someone who prefers less fatty pork belly, you may like this dish. Overall satisfied! If the price of each dish could be abit less pricey, it’ll be bette
4
The background music was far too loud. It was impossible to keep a conversation. I asked for the music to be slightly reduced but nothing was done, only changed us for a different time.
5
When 4 people of different nationalities catch up on dinner meeting for first time and end up becoming good friends, lot more credit goes to the Food and Service provided by the restaurant like Neon Pigeon. Thanks for good memories...Highly recommend this place for Fusion!
5
Was here recently and was very happy! Good service with friendly people in a nice atmosphere, buzzing! Drinks are delicious and different, but I think the real sweet spot is the food. A great variety of dishes with fantastic flavor! The humus was the best I have ever had, and I lived in the Middle East! Well done and I recommend to everyone!
4
Entering this restaurant is like coming into Malibu Club in GTA Vice City. Tendy and neonic. Anyway, we enjoyed the food a lot. I personally love the soft shell crab and my friend love the duck confit. Cheese rice was also susprisingly good! Overall it was a nice dining experience but some suggestions would be to install two or three more small lamps as it was dark all around. Also the website is a little bit confusin
5
Try their hummus, it has a hint of curry flavour and one of the dishes that I always order first. Their Brussels sprouts and home cured bacon is equally amazing as well. Absolutely love the food and drinks pairing here. Great chill out place as well, would definitely be back again just for their hummus and Brussels sprout
1
Avoid this place unless you enjoy getting ripped off!Potatoes are $10. Tastes exactly like a baked potato, with a little twist on the cream. Here's the catch: they serve you less than one baked potato on that plate. For $10.Their curry katsu wurst is an even bigger con. The sausage is sliced, and the pieces are measly. Added together, the pieces don't come up to even a quarter of a regular bratwurst. The meats are okay, but not spectacular. Again, portions are tiny, and the asking price is beyond belief.Given that you would be along Keong Saik Road, there are tons of better options to be had for much greater value.There is not much ambience. The seating is crowded, the music is too loud, you can barely have a conversation with your dinner partner
4
I visited after reading the trip advisor reviews and was not disappointed.The restaurant has a great ambience and the staff are efficient and friendly. I had several vegetarian small dishes , all of which were crisp and fresh and had delicious dressings.Service was prompt and not intrusiv
4
The good is very good. I am not a food connoisseur but I would give the food a 8/10. The portion is good for 4 people. Taste is wonderful. Atmosphere is really good. Staff is attentive and fast service. The only thing I have to fault is the strict 2 hours dinner. Like hey, do you really need to chase your client out? And the price.....very very pricey food and cocktails. Prepare to spend at least $100 per person if you visit. If you telling me you plan to spend below $100 then prepare to go without cocktails and order only a few dishes. Best to go in large groups cos you can try as many dishes as possible. Bad for small groups, limitation on the food you can order
5
We met friends for dinner at Neon Pigeon where we had dined before. We sat on one of the high tables in the window which is a good vantage point. The food was excellent and the service was good. Five of us shared a number of the small plates. Highlights were the octopus legs in black vinegar and the soft shell crab bao. I'm sure we will return on a future trip to Singapore
3
Overpriced average food, the octopus was a let down and same goes for the swordfish and eggplant. The tuna tataki , soft shell crab Bao and broccoli with asparagus dishes were very good though. Staff were very friendly. I just expected more from the food, especially at the pric
4
The ambience of the local is trendy and catchy, and the food mixes in a surprising and tasty way different flavors in a Japanese-based cuisine.
4
The place is cool and cosy. Food tasted good, small in portions. About 7 dishes should be good for 2people. Drinks were pricey.
4
Highly recommend the home marrow, soft shell crab pao and pork - all great dishes although small portions.
2
As the title suggests, epic prices for portions perhaps better suited for birds -pun intended. Food was average, lacked a wow factor especially for the price tag that came along
5
Neon Pigeon always pleases with terrific food, attentive service and great funky atmosphere. Have been there several times and will come back many more!
5
I have to confess that i did not try the very good looking food, but the drinks were outstanding and friendly served by the sympathic bartenders!
5
A friend and I headed here after a recommendation around 10pm on a Saturday night. We had already eaten so were looking for a cool bar to grab a few drinks and we were not disappointed. Getting the last two stools at the bar was perfect as we were able to interact with the brilliant bartender Kai - funny, informative and just overall a great energy he entertained us as he whipped up our interesting and delicious cocktails plus gave some great options for places to kick onto afterwards (the bar was closing around 1am)Definitely recommend it for a either a small group or even a larger one as there were couches you could sit at circling a small table. Oh and the welcome sake shot was a nice little added extra ;) ENJOY!
5
We let the staff select 7 courses to share. All course were excellent in presentation and of excellent quality and taste. Ingredients were of good quality and freshness.Of the seven dishes the standouts would have to be the baby scallops and of course the dessert of Japanese curd.Staff – most helpful and attentive Atmosphere – reasonably quiet although at the early sitting the restaurant was not full
4
I was visiting from Hong Kong and catching up with some friends.The food was creative and tasty. I recommend the edamame hummus, pork belly and bacon/egg/cheese rice.We picked a random bottle of sake from the menu and it was lovely and smooth.This place is best for a date, meeting new friends or perhaps meeting someone there. The music is loud, so not conducive to catching up or quiet conversation
5
Neon Pigeon is a gem. I have been to zillion restaurants but this one left a mark. Everything about it is amazing. The food choices maybe limited at first glance so we ordered almost everything. Everything was lip smacking delicious. The vegetables have never tasted this good. The best think of course is the manager who kept us going with free Sake's. We even ate the desserts. Mind blowing. Three cheers for Gerald and his team
4
Yummy tapas style food and interesting cocktails. Love the rustic yet modern decor. A little pricey but well compensated with flavourful taste.
4
Lovely food, the cucumber starter was great, Just as the soft Shell crap. Music was a bit fuzzy and vague. Overall good!
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at this quaint Japanese fusion restaurant. Dishes were generous in portion, tasteful and well presented. Other than the tables by the windows, the setting is tight and cozy but you can enjoy a peak into the orders from the next table to gather some new ideas. We ordered quite a few tapa-like dishes from the onset; but future visits we will definitely take our time to pace our order. My favourite was the ribs; succulent and flavorful. Well done to the waitress for recommending!
5
I've been to Neon Pigeon many times (exceptional food, great ambiance, good service), but never really experienced the cocktails, until last night. Here's my review: there are Mixologists and then there are Mixologists... Kai would be the latter! I ordered a signature cocktail; not a cocktail that is similar to something else, etc.. Kai (pronounced "K-eye") delivered to our table the Taro-San. And I asked him to stay while I tried it and lemme tell you, it started us on a journey that will not be soon forgotten: the cocktail was a symphony of flavours that captured the imagination, it is everything that a cocktail should be and more! It is the type of cocktail that wins awards. The symphony of flavours unfolded as it travelled through the palette; sweet and savoury, smooth and frothy. When I said, "wait, what is this?! What inspired this drink, what's the background? Tell us everything!" Kai introduced himself, and gave use the background and inspiration for the drink, the ingredients, the fusion of ingredients inspired by his German upbringing and his Asian culture, etc. Bottom Line, the cocktails were so amazing that I wanted to ask if they served a Tall or Grande-sized versions (yes, that good!). And if you are a "Bellini" kind of person (you like what you like and want what you want, same-ole, same-ole), you will not be disappointed. Order the Momo, it is a deconstructed and elevated version of bubbles and sweetness but with a twist and turns that will not disappoint. One more thing, we noticed that even though the bar was humming, and the restaurant was full (on a Friday night), Kai made the time to deliver every cocktail, made eye contact and spoke to the people at the table, and like us, many were simply blown away by his cocktails. When you go to Neon Pigeon (it is a must), go directly to the bar and ask for Kai! And get ready for an unforgettable evening: cocktails, cuisine, ambiance and service. You will never wish to leave
4
Good qualifty of food, but they recommend order 6-7 small dishes for two which eventually trun out quite a lot. Maybe good place for group of 4 or more like team building, otherwise too expensive even if it is Singapore. Waiter keep asking about ordering more beer that was quite annoying as well.
4
Had an overall great night out at Neon Pigeon: delicious fusion food and tasty, interesting cocktails - in a funky venue. We ordered 6 small plates (the staff recommend 7-8, but 6 was enough for us): the Tokyo hummus, soft shell crab bao, yuzu cauliflower, octopus leg, clams, and unagi rice. And two cocktails: the teared Negroni and the Karashi Sour. The food was overall all excellent. Our favorites were the Unagi Rice and the Hummus. The rice was really tasty (it had a risotto-like texture) and the hummus was a great fusion dish (I usually find fusion to be a euphemism for mediocre). But I would recommend trying any of the above dishes and would feel comfortable trying other dishes at Neon Pigeon. With one big exception: The Miso Clams. The small plate of Miso Clams costs $20 and comes with 4 clams. $5/clam seems kind of expensive... They were also unremarkable. To make any sense, I think either the price needs to come down significantly or there needs to be more clams. Or at least tell the customer you're getting only 4 clams at that price. We were pretty shocked when the plate arrived. And dismayed as we scraped bits of burnt clam meat out of the shell to make the best of the dish. The cocktails were great. The bartenders seemed to have a good sense of how to play with the recipes for standard cocktails to make them a little more special. We planned on heading to The Library, nearby, otherwise we would have stayed for another. Overall, the bill was a bit high. Part of the reason was the weirdly expensive clam dish. I'm sure part of the reason was location. Finally. Part of the reason seems to be that the restaurant compels customers to do charity (contribute to clean water and anti-poverty funds). Charity is important, to be sure. But if the owners/managers feel so strongly about it, maybe the contributions ought to come out of their profits (and leave it optional for customers) rather than force it on the latter
3
Nice place - good atmosphere. We went there for drinks and snacks with business associates- food was very good - and the staff were helpful and friendly. Only thing that did put a downer on the evening was finding that the double gin and tonic we'd been ordering was $36 - I know Singapore is expensive - and I could have checked - but this just seemed excessive.
4
The food has consistently been excellent each time I eat here and the staff are extremely helpful without pestering you overly much. Their fantastic customer service extended to accommodating our difficult request for no garlic to be used in any of the dishes. The food still tasted fantastic!It would be great if larger sake bottles were available on the menu
5
I went here with a friend from our Singapore office. The place is a little small but the interior is great. I immediately felt not cool enough upon entering. Brick walls with street art showing pigeons in headphones. I thought I was in London for a second. The drinks were fantastic. We had a some cocktail with prosecco to start with which was too sweet for me. I switched to my default Hendricks martini. Now those were cocktails! They were so smooth and refreshing. Now, the food is even a step above the cocktails. We split:- soft shell crab dumplings- Japanese crab cakes - short ribs - unagi fried rice I recommend all of those. The soft shell crab and the ribs were my favorite but they were all close contenders. The staff were great too. They were engaging and funny and very attentive. I would totally recommend this place and hope to come back here again in the future the next time I am in Singapore.
5
Organized business dinner at this joint several times. Consistent good service, fusion japanese food & drinks. Cooktails drinks price are ok (similar to cocktail bar SGD 20-SGD 25) more worthwhile if you get a bottle of wine or sake.Must try - roasted bone marrow- tuna tartaki- soft shell crab bao-smoked baby ribs- japanese crab cak
5
This place does everything differently, and very well!! the drinks are potent, and different. the food is something else. Go eat here, you cannot go wrong.
4
Always enjoy the dining experience at Neon Pigeon. The combination of a tasty & innovative menu, great vibe (think New York) and the location in chic Chinatown is a big draw. Highly recommend.
5
A small yet well set out restaurant and bar...both are equal in excellence-Awesome food and cocktails.. Fun lively vibrant atmosphere takes you out of Singas for a while!
5
there are three of us and we really enjoy the environment there. food here nice too. its very suitable for friends gathering.
3
Ambiance was nice and its a good chill-out place. Food was so so as compared to other tapas/small plate restaurant.
5
Met some friends here for food on a Friday night. Our table wasn't ready but we were shown to the bar and given a complimentary sake while we looked at the drinks menu. Food was creative and really good. The baby back ribs were outstanding. Cocktails were great and the bar staff really seemed to know their stuff. Would definitely go back.
4
Although one might say the food isn't the best of Singapore I still enjoyed it very much. The different dishes are mostly something one hasn't eaten before and I loved that fact. The service was as well amazing and we all had a lot of fun trying out half of the dishes.
5
I came here with some work colleagues/friends on a Friday evening. It was really busy, and a bit loud, but a very vibrant scene. I enjoyed the decor and the choice of music, and would definitely come back for a night out. Dinner options were also good! We had a few food allergies in our group, but these were catered to easily. Standouts: tuna tataki, rump steak, Brussel sprouts, and crab cakes.
4
Our friends (Singapore residents) took us to the Neon Pigeon just so we could try the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). We learned the menu had recently been revamped, and the Korean Fried Chicken had been 86ed. To protest this unspeakable tragedy, our hosts opted to go on a hunger strike and we did not eat at the Neon Pigeon. However, we decided to drown our sorrows in some the restaurant's artisanal cocktails. The staff was contrite, attentive, and had a great sense of humor
5
A few local friends took me to this place. The food is absolutely delicious! It's expensive, as is everything in Singapore, but you get what you pay for. The only down side for me was the music was so loud we could barely hear each other.
5
Fantastic experience: food was amazing, cocktails were stunning and the atmosphere was electric! We had visited from Australia and was definitely worth it.
5
Finally had a chance to try this after hearing so much about it. Food didn't disappoint and the atmosphere was cool. It's loud tho so don't plan to have any deep serious convos!
4
Great food and ambience! Refreshing cocktails best way to kick off dinner! Tight menu but all good selection! Efficient service! I will be back again! The place has a good buzz!
4
The sharing plates recommended were all extremely tasty but we were suggested to order a bit too much food and could not finish a significant portion of it. Drinks were excellent.
5
Nice design, very good food, very good drinks. I like it there. A bit pricy. I love the Japanese houmous, but should have more bread to spread it.
5
Fantastic ambience, very friendly staff, food is interestingly different but the highlight for me was the bartender (Kai) who came to our table and asked about our preferences so he could suggest a drink accordingly, they turned out to be great.Awesome experience, will definitely go there again
5
Neon Pigeon is one of our favorite restaurants to have a nice dinner or take visitors to experience a great meal. The service is second to none and the menu, both dishes and cocktails are full of flavor - we love the softshell crab bao, hummus, cauliflower, etc!. We will be back again.
2
The essence of a restaurant is its food. The essence of this restaurant is poor. It tries too hard with its recipes and the results are that the food and flavors are at best confused. The execution in terms of cooking is mediocre.The service is efficient and mechanical but lacks any warmth even the semblance of it. The other thing I dislike about this place was being told I had 2 hours to eat and then I need to scoot off.
3
Four of us ordered up a storm in this Asian fusion, izakaya style restaurant. I remembered the standout dishes (eg edamame hummus - smooth as silk so we gobbled all that stuff up enthusiastically, kurobota pork chop - tender and bursting with flavour) as much as those that we didn't care too much for (eg miso clams - overpowered by a large gob of paste, miso eggplant - mint and lemon took over). Other dishes were tasty enough (eg green beans and cucumber). The wine selection is very limited and pricey (as far as I know). Perhaps, bring your own?Overall, the place entertains with beautiful plating that whets the appetite (which doesn't work too well at times as it sets expectations sky high), an urban, funky vibe and efficient service. Our bill for 4 came to $428, which seems in line with others who reviewed this establishment. I thought it was pricey.Neon Pigeon also makes it a point to inform you that it strives to be a responsible company (see pic) - stating upfront in the menu that the service charge goes towards paying their staff a liveable wage AND also to Action Against Hunger. The latter is an unusual, laudable move so they should share information about this best practice with other establishments. They also ask that you donate $1 each (opt out basis) towards a sustainable water filtration system which provides diners with unlimited filtered water.
4
The food quality is very good but pricey. if its for 2 people, just order 4 to 5 small dishes will do but the waiter will tell you its not enough and usually 2 people need 6 to 7 dishes. Just order 4 to 5 small dishes first then decide if you want more.
5
This is a great place to chat, enjoy the most amazing Japanese shared plates and some groovy cocktails...
5
Neon Pigeon continues to live up to expectation since my last visit 4 months ago. Hosted a group of 6 for dinner and all dishes were done to perfection. We went with the recommendation of the service crew and it was indeed a wise choice.
5
Where to begin? Well for starters the vibe and style of the place is modern and funky. Add to that excellent cocktails (Pika-too my personal fav) and you are set up for something special! Tapas style, Izakay modern urban japanese food is served by friendly staff, who will give excellent info on the menu. We dined on 7-8 dishes, my personal highlights included the hummus, beef and ribs. Would highly recommend this place if you're in Singapore and as Arnie says... 'I'll be back'
4
It's literally like being in a club... only that you are seated. Surprisingly tasty food. Would recommend anyone to get the duck confit and Tokyo hummus. Super friendly waiters and a fantastic door greeter (not really sure how to term him since he was stationed at the entry).. he took the service to another level when we enquired if we could purchase a cake since it was my friend's birthday. Since they didn't really have much deserts, he brought it onto himself to arrange something and enquired about it when we leaving. Used a super hot bartender to distract us by giving us sakae shots while he did hasty backend work to prepare it once he realised the table manager forgot about it. One note of improvement is.. can you please replace the table manager (dude in ah beng blond hair that thinks he's one step above the rest )? Please educate him to be more customer orientated. Flinging our bill on the table when we have requested it is not a way to end off the whole experience when you have acknowledged our requests with snotty head nods. It was much better when the other waiters talked to us. Tyvm

Thoroughly disappointed by the food at Neon Pigeon, despite all the positive reviews received here. Would only recommend this place for drinks after work and NOT the food.Firstly the service: ordered several dishes of "Japanese tapas" to share amongst 4 people. The first arrived about 1hr into the sitting, the next few came in one at a time, which was extremely frustrating as at one stage we were left sharing a bowl of the mixed beans - silly as this should be used as an accompaniment to other dishes. Shouldn't be complicated to have most main dishes arrive at similar times (not ~20mins apart).Food standard: the combinations of flavours were too strange and a little too "try hard" or "experimental" for my liking. A perfectly good duck leg confit was mixed with an overpowering seaweed sauce which made the delicious duck taste of fish. Really unpleasant. Beef was overlooked, ended up being very tough & chewy. Edamame humus was acceptable though nothing exceptional in flavour. Bowl of mixed beans were adequate and did as they said on the tin (i.e nothing beyond a bowl of mixed beans).Value for money: poor. Small portions and poorly executed dishes alongside slow service was not worth the $250+ spent. Would not be returning or recommending this place for dinner. Kitchen too small to cope with number of tables and orders whilst overcomplicating dishes & flavours.
5
Wow! This place has been on our list via word of mouth. Mouth watering delights awaited. Their hummus with curry chips, the crispy chicken skin, clever starters. The soft shell crab bao- wow! The pork ribs, tasty! It's crowded, noisy, but the service was like clockwork, the dishes perfectly paced. We loved everything except the scallops, a little rubbery and underwhelming compared to the rest; and to wash it all down, they had our favourite rose on the wine list, cheers!
5
We had high expectations when booking the table (2 days in advance), and asked for a table at the bar with overlook of the kitchen (since we like see the chefs in action). They tried to accommodate this but since there are no such tables, we were placed closed to the bar. It was however not a problem to move to a table closer to the open kitchen. It was also a better table since the first one was situated in a way that you feel like you are at a great party but sitting in the part of the room where nothing fun happens. So, when booking, make sure you get a table where it happens. The food was excellent. We were recommended to share seven courses, and since we love food we actually ordered equivalent to 8 small plates. We could however survived on 6 plates only, and we are two men that eats a lot.Our favorites were the tuna tataki and the soft shell crab bao. The full serving ticked all the boxes when comes to the past years food trends, i.e cauliflower, yuzu, ribs, black garlic. So don't expect a frontier restaurant that drives the development, but a restaurant that knows what is hot and understands how to make the best out of it. Had a cocktail each. Innovative but not over the top crazy. Very enjoyable. For the food we had beers, and I would prefer to have a greater selection to choose from. The Neon pigeon looks and feels like a place that should be good in crafted beer, but no. But it is still a five out of five place: meet expectations regarding food, cocktails, vibe and price. People who complain about small size portion have basically not grasped the concept of half portion restaurant and understood that this is something that is reflected on the bill. We payed $236 for two ppl having one cocktail and a bear each, we ordered 6 small plates and one normal (which was too much for us). To this 10 % serving fee is added to the bill, whereafter 7 % tax is added. The price was as expected for this kind of place and for Singapore.
4
The soft shell crab bao was the stand out dish. We also had the pork chops, the rump, the seared tuna and the eggplant - all plated well. Service was brusque, efficient. The place was buzzing on a Wednesday evening. Prices were on the high side considering the portion sizes.
4
We enjoyed out night out at Neon Pigeon in Keong Saik road. Japanese food and bar in a groovy, urban setting. We were given a table for four in the window for the two of us which is always a bonus. We loved the soft shell crab bao and the black vinegar octopus legs, both were beautiful. We also had the miso clams, unagi rice and the korobuta pork, none of which were outstanding, all okay but not as good as the crab or the octopus. We had a bottle of the rose which was lovely. We will go back
4
Overall extremely happy with this one. Easily would have given 5 stars if staff had been a bit more friendly or service-oriented, however they weren't that bad and the food and atmosphere made up for it.MUST try the tokyo hummus; liver pate; soft shell crab bao; beef rump in vinegar, & meringue with crumble dessert - all were truly unbelievable. Very impressed. One review suggested the pork ribs but there were way over-seasoned, even with lemon slice to balance. Bone marrow and both veggie dishes we tried also over-rated, but still good. Don't go expecting a long wine list, but they had 3 reds/whites each plus prosecco and rose, so you'll find something. Either way it's an izakaya place so beer and cocktails are main drink attractions. Note that it's a loud and fun place so not for the quiet / romantic types... The table next to us even asked the staff to turn the music down, but we didn't think it was that loud to warrant that! Overall a really amazing experience. Would definitely recommend and take friends there. Absolutely give this one a try
5
We tried about 8 items from the menu and everything was excellent! Best we're the pork dishes and seafood
4
Food was very good and imaginative but wine list was limited and expensive. This place is good for the younger set, noisy and has a good vibe.
4
Very interesting fusion kitchen, super tasty and surprising dishes on the menu. Funky experience and recommended if you are looking for something different and good.

Very good Japanese-fusion tapas. Take 5 to 8 plates for 2. We took 5 and it was enough for 2.
Fun atmosphere on Saturday night with waiters serving free Sake. More for groups, a bit noisy for couples who wants calm but fun!

Innovative cocktails ... great taste .. tried the Negroni with smoked rosemary. Absolutely fantastic . For dinner it was beans, Eggplant, Beetroot, Soft shell crab n chicken . All dishes are served tapas style. Order at least 5 between 2. Don't forget to order the rice at the end . Comp desert at the end was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend!!

While on our way to Sri Lanka we stopped over in Singapore to catch up with old friends. Being great foodies they took us to Neon Pigeon on another friend's recommendation.The atmosphere was fantastic. Young and vibrant.The service was efficient and friendly.The fusion dishes were amazing and the wine superb.No cheap, but the it is Singapore

Ordered quite a fair bit of bites.Overall the food is okay. Doesn't have the wow factor that makes you want to return again. Ingredient quality is normal so for the price similar to FOC, I would say it so so. Service is okay, not fantastic.The environment is noisy as the music was loud and place is small. The table for 2 pax is so small that you can only place 3 to 4 small plates so much that your drinks are pushed to the edge of the table. The patrons had to shout across the table to be heard. Cocktail are decent.Average spending is S$150/2 pax

I got off work early and decided to check out the place thinking it was an izakaya. As we were early about 6.30pm we weren't very hungry as yet. We wanted to just chat and have drinks first. But the whole time we felt pressured by the manager and staff to order food. It was a Tuesday, so not like they have a line outside the restaurant. Place was half empty. And oh they charge for water. Food was not that great either. Plenty of other options elsewhere to spend your hard earned money

My husband and I try and visit a new place for dinner each week. Neon Pigeon would be up there as one of our favourites so far. We gave it an 8.5/10. Delicious food, excellent service and loved that the environment had been carefully considered with glass water refills (not plastic) and cardboard/brown paper bag doggie bag. Atmosphere was fun, although a little on the loud side for a Wednesday night conversation. Would definitely go back.

lovely food—my favorites were the bone marrow and kurobata pork. but everything we ordered—other than charred carrots with truffle—was fab. the restaurant is very noisy (we went on a friday night) and tables small as other reviewers have pointed out. not cheap but good value for money, other than whisky that two in our party ordered at an exorbitant price per glass. there was an interesting selection of cocktails with sake, one of which i tried and liked. i will certainly go back and try more of neon pigeon's food in what i believe (behind the times) has become a buzzing neighborhood for trendy restaurants
4
Food was not bad, crowded izakaya. Service staff was curt though, and the seating was a 2 hour seating so can't hang out for long
3
Expected more from this place. Only soft shell crab Bao, bone marrow and smoked baby back ribs are above average.
5
Amazing ambience and food. Value for money . Well worth thr visit.

Good atmosphere and nice food. Service was ok, but tables are small. Would be good to have a bigger/better wine list.
3
This is a brilliant, vibrant and cool place to visit with really good staff. Portion and price is a little high but guess that is the price you pay for the trade off!
5
On a Monday night, this place was packed! The atmosphere was energetic and cheerful- seemed to me it was a party rather than just a restaurant.The service was very friendly and food was delicious- we ate a bit too much so had to take a walk to the MRT afterward
5
Love love love this place.. I didnt have dinner plan that night and pick this among several options near where I stayed. I was pleasantly surprise with the dishes; dined solo I ordered three 'small' size dishes as advised (which I learned later I could've done with two small plates). I had Tuna Tataki (good, but not wow), miso roasted eggplant (loved it), and unagi rice (floored by it), and Betty the special gin based cocktail (looove). The service was quick and efficient, I noticed the waiters can be quite chatty for those in groups. The place is quite casual and it gives the feel of a big warm family kitchen...so in other words it could get quite noisy and one might got occasion bumped by the (rather intoxicated) person sitting behind. Anyways, I am very pleased with the food and cocktail.. so I will get back and try other dishes on the menu

We had dinner at Neon Pigeon one night. The place was described as an Izakaya by our friends and just having been to Japan we were curious. While it is cute, it is also very loud and hard to have a conversation. Food was ok to great, service attentive and fun. But....I think it was just very expensive for what it is and I will rather go to other places in the area that are less pricey
3
We had the squid which was rubbery. The scallops was also overcooked and dry. The pumpkins were crunchy, I prefer them soft and sweet. The gin tonic of the season was unfortunately too bitter. The ambience was great on a Friday night. So for that I would retur
3
We only try four dishes , maybe not enough to rate . Most probably I'll go back again and try more . Scallops and eggplant very disappointed Bone marrow good Rice very goodService nice from the waitress Very bad from the manager ( a bit arrogant to our experience ) maybe he think because he works in an industrial , cool and happening place he can talk rude to people.Anyway . I recommend the place and I'll go back to give a try it one more tim
5
Dinner at Neon Pigeon was really good! Food was unique, service was excellent. Can be a little pricey though.
4
Tuck in one of the shophouses in Keong Saik, Neon Pigeon stands out by its neon pink pigeon displays at their door.
Mostly served bar snacks, I ordered the baby back ribs and pork chop as mains. Ribs are awesome!
4
Great variety and for sharing. A little annoyed that they didn't have two of the whiskeys on menu, but we were very well taken care of. Music was pretty good too! Will visit again to try everything else.
3
Service staff was treated poorly by the restaurant manager which was quite shocking. No wonder why the staff was rather grumpy
5
I just had dinner there last night with few of my girlfriends. It was a surprise dinner party. Group of more than 8 people will have do pre selected dinner which was great because the food came quickly. The food was really delicious! My Favourite was a lot in the appetiser: the edamame hummus, yellow tail tar tar and the cauliflower. The ribs were good too.The best part was that the bartender came around with big bottle of sake and giving us free sake shots. Great service and perfect for Group dinner with friends!

I've been to Neon Pigeon a few times. It's always a good choice for catching up with friends and enjoying modern Asian food to share. The menu has quite a few new items since my last visit, sad to see the fried chicken go buth soft shell crab bao were fabulous, tataki tuna sublime and eggplant with lotus roots really unusual and pleasing. I still want to go back and order the pork shoulder to share (must do it in advance). For now I've included Neon Pigeon on Singapore Foodie dot com in my top 5 modern Asian restaurants for dinner with friends. Service on this last visit was exceptional. One of our group had an onion intolerance and our waiter was considerate and thoughtful in advising what we could have. One downside is that it does get very loud in here as the evening wears on.
5
Had some amazing food here, lots of variety and flavors. Service was spot on and the drinks were some of the most creative cocktails ive had. Well done and a fun and interesting venu. Thought the price was reasonable for that Top END style and we really enjoyed our night , thanks
4
My friend told me that Neon Pigeon is presently one of the most popular restaurants in Singapore, and after dining there for my birthday, I understand why. All the food we ordered were yummy! They all looked delicious from the start, presentation was superb, nothing fancy, allowing the food to be the star of the table. My favorite is the rice with the chicharon (pork crackles) on top as well as the soft buns, squid and eggplant.
4
Quite a trendy bar/restaurant in a cool part of the city. Great cocktails. Food orders work on small plates (around 7-8 for two people) - the stand out dished for me were the scallops and the lamb. Definitely worth stopping by for dinner. Would recommend booking if you'll be there post 7pm.
5
Celebrated a birthday here and the experience was wonderful! There were three of us dining and we ordered about 7-8 small plates so we could try a variety of dishes. Every single one we had was delicious! Highly recommend the soft shell crab bao, crab cake, edamame hummus, miso eggplant and tuna tataki. Service was exceptional - friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable. Really appreciated our server advising us on appropriate portions for our table so that we wouldn't end up wasting food. Also be warned - if you're celebrating a special occasion, they will round off your evening by offering you several guzzles of Japanese sake from a giant bottle - so best be able to have the guts for it! A really fun and memorable evening. We will be back
5
Delicious food with superb service (friendly, attentive and not pushy). Love the atmosphere which is just hip enough without being painfully hipster. Edamame hummus for the win!
4
I came here with a large group when in Singapore for the GP.
The staff were attentive and accommodating (of a group that was supposed to be 6 and 12 arrived), the food great, price reasonable and everyone had a great night.
5
Was a fantastic atmosphere and even better food. Couldn't say enough about this place. Servers were fast and had a great fun attitude. The venue itself was just perfect. Definitely worth the time
5
A Japanese restaurant without any Japanese owners or staff.....wasn't expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised. The food was fantastic, will have to go again as I could not physically eat everything I wanted to try on the menu. Started with yellowfin tartar, then the roasted marrow, Brussels sprouts with miso glaze and bacon. All good. The highlight of the evening were the sake based cocktails. The girl at the bar really knew her stuff and made some great recommendations
3
Interesting menu... with some quirky fusion dishes. Some work ... some don't. (Try Soft shell crab bao, prawns/shitake, the ribs, and the bacon rice....always a crowd pleaser!) From about 9pm on a Friday or Saturday it gets pretty loud ... but it's that sort of place. Ã‡an be fun with a group of friends.
4
Nice, cool and fancy venue...Busy place with loud and cool music.Service is fast and switched on.Drinks menu limited as the bar is rather small...considering its Japanese, lots of Japanese spirits...you gotta like that.Food was ok...but also not much more than that. Fun presentation of most dishes but taste wise rather average...soft shell crab very disappointing but ribs are top.Not really priced at the low end but a place you can try when u want it a bit different
5
First time here. It was a really cool joint that has a great bar vibe. Started with just the neon pigeon outline rather than a worded signage. (One of my friends funnily almost couldnt find the place)Interesting wall murals screaming out their cool design intent.Great fresh food on every plate served.Liked the 10+ dishes I tried.Food was fast out to the tables. Well staffed with wait staff that pass by and read any signal for assistance really quick.They had great music that gave energy to the place though could have come down a notch or two. Crazy Sake moments when one of the staff went around pouring sake down anyone who wanted a swig.Enjoyable night
5
We had a great dinner at Neon Pigeon for a friends birthday. The atmosphere was great and the waiting staff were very friendly and efficient. The food was also very nice and was a great fusion of Asian and European . Would definitely recommend it as a destination for people that want a great, relaxed vibe and try something abbot different on the food
2
Went here with friends to have a drink and a laugh. The laugh went too far when the bar staff were downing open bottles of Sake rice wine with a couple of expat women who were so drunk they could not stand up. Complaints were made but nothing happened. This dive bar too a dive too far
5
great atmosphere for a casual and hip catch-up with friends. The food is pure yumminess, the staffs friendly and the price friendly. Your absolute MUST-haves are the edamame humous, the cucumber, the soft-shell crab bao, the ribs and the smoked bacon rice. Take the small plates so you can try out more dishes! :)
5
The food is amazing. The only negative point I can think of it is extremely cold. Secondly way to many waiters.... it's almost like stressful when they walk around you all the time...
5
Love this place! After 20 days of street Malasyan Food this place was like paradise for us!
Nice wine and good food! A bit Expensive but i still recommend this place!
4
The best part for me was the fact that they had a lot of vegetarian options!! Even though it was fusion Japanese food, all the dishes tasted very good and my favourite was the roasted eggplant!!! Totally loved it! Staff and the ambience is great!!

The food at Neon Pigeon was impressive, but the portion sizes were small and the menu was more expensive than anticipated. A small plate will cost you around $20 each. Between two of us ladies, we ordered 4 small plates and it was just enough to make us full. The service was attentive and the restaurant wasn't very busy (we went on a Monday evening). The biggest problem I had with Neon Pigeon (which has nothing to do with the food), was the credit card splitting policy. As there were just 2 of us who split everything, we wanted to split the bill half/half as you would be allowed to do at basically any other restaurant (especially one that is charging so much). However, Neon Pigeon has a minimum S$100 PER CARD for splitting the bill. This is absolutely outrageous and will definitely discourage me from coming back (especially with a group of friends, as paying would become complicated). I hope the management seriously considers changing this policy as it is absolutely absurd and sets the restaurant apart negatively from its peers.

Getting there:Alight at Chinatown station Exit A and head towards Keong Siak road. Takes 10mins to get there. Alternatively alight at Outram station. Ambience:Chillax, great for all sorts of gathering. Good taste for music playing in the background. Though I must say it attracts the expatriates more than locals. Food & Drinks:We ordered 6 small plates to share between 2 pax. Everything was delicious except for the shogun salad. Would strongly recommend the tuna, crab cake and soft shell crab bun. Portions are tiny. Drinks are refreshing, good amount of alcohol in their cocktails. Service:Haughty servers who speaks in accents. My friend and I quite enjoy observing the distinct difference in treatment between other tables with expatriates and our table made up of two Singaporean ladies. Locals thinking of going there may want to fake an accent too to receive better services. :-) Price:On average each small portion cost $18 before GST & service charge. Cocktails average also $18. Our total bill came up to $200++.
5
Shared 6 small plates with 2 other friends and the Dashi Poached Squid and Salmon Tartare stood out. Loved the sake infused cocktail, Bees ness, with the end of the cocktail kicking in with quite with a surprise. Atmosphere was good but we got to speak a little louder. Music was great too! Will be back to try the other dishes!

Very good indeed. There were a group of six of us and we had dinner here on saturday evening. Im not a big fan of the "two sitting" policy and we were advised when we sat that the table would be needed at 9.30 - in this case, it was fine as two hours was more than enough time as the food comes out reasonably quickly - but not too quickly. I would have liked to have been advised of this earlier just in case. The style is modern Japanese tasting style shared plates and every dish was mouthwatering. The dishes were on the small side and I would have liked a little more on each plate, but by the time we had eaten it all , it was probably enough - i think we had maybe 6-8 different dishes ? The highlight was the soft shell crab in a bun - unbelievable!! You must try it. The decor is very cool and the atmosphere is great. This is, as per anywhere in Singapore, expensive by world standards especially when you throw the alcohol in. Still stunned by Singapore alcohol prices! Well worth it though - would definitely go back

We were a party of four and came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Nice relaxed ambiance with 90s music in the background. They have an open-ish kitchen where we could view how each dish is painstakingly prepared. Since the plates are small there is a minimum order so We ordered about 7 different items of food and four different cocktails. The standout dishes were edamame hummus dip and the prawn stuffed mushroom. Great fusion flavors! and would return for these. The rest of the plates (soft shell crab and scallop crostini) were still good...except for the korubota pork chop which was served too rare for our liking and thus we had to return to the kitchen. Cocktails were a bit of a surprise. I could not recall the names, though one sounded like Picachu, are mostly sake-infused and are a mix of spicy, sweet and sour all at the same time, playing with your taste buds. First sip is a bit disorienting but after a few more you'll get it.
5
This place is not big. We were a party of 10. So we waited in the small bar area and they accommodated us quickly.The food is Asian fusion. It was delicious. All of it. The dog shell crab in particular was the best crab I have ever had. I loved it. For just this reason alone I would go back here. But there were plenty more. This is like a down to earth version of nobu or hakassan. Loved i

What a great find in a very unique street of China town. We had 5 dishes, all excellent but the stand outs were Tuna tartare & Hommus which they had forgotten but quickly arrived when we asked.As for service; not even our water glasses got dry, very attentive.Hope next time we go there the wine list has improved though
4
I like how innovative of each dish. The hummus has a very special frangant . Even thought the price is on a high side I still recommend this place!
5
The edamame hummus was amazing. The momo drink was delicious! Great atmosphere, good music, good vibes.
5
We were hosted while waiting and the excellent staff were apologetic, while free pouring sake, which made for a very content group.
Food excellent, atmosphere better. Best dining experience this year in sing
5
We stayed just down the road from Neon Pidgeon and stumbled across it on our way home.
What a great place. One of the best Baos I have ever had and the ribs were just amazing.
Highly recommend.
5
Went for a meal with a client. It has an easy atmosphere. The food and service was great. Recommend the hummus, the beef rib, bone marrow and Teared Negroni (pre dinner). Not much wine to choose from though.
5
The boyfriend discovered this restaurant and was delighted when I stepped in and saw the menu. I love the concept and the idea that you can come here famished or barely hungry at all, and be able to choose just the right portion to fill you up. We indulged on a number of dishes (7-8) and loved every plate that came along. I found the ribs however a bit too salty for my taste. Everything else was top notch including the cocktails. I consider myself young, hip and happening, however the music was way too loud and way too eclectic for me. The inconsistencies the the genres of the songs playing really threw me, however didn't entirely spoil my experience. Not sure if that was the vibe they were going for.Don't let the ranking of this restaurant put you off. The food was absolutely delicious and I'm looking forward to drag my friends along for some delicious tastes and bevs
5
Was remembered again once I came with a few buddies for a some bites and drinks. As usual great cocktails even the girl bartender was not around. Got treated by the new chap, Kai for some great ones. It seems the food menu has changed and looks good. Tried the Tuna and it was absolutely mind blowing. Love coming back to this place. Well done guys and keep it up
3
Mixed review on this. Trendy bar/ resturant with great cocktails. Of the three of use they forgot 2 courses and then added a ton of someone else's drinks to the bill. Maybe just went on an off day.
5
We recently spent a week in Singapore with some very good friends who were once neighbours of Justin, one of the amazing young chefs creating the wonderful dishes served here. This young man from a small Victorian (Australia) country town plays a big part in the creation of this food.We consider ourselves privileged to have been served some of the best food we have ever eaten but to also have been given in depth explanations of the processes involved in their creation. It would be difficult & time consuming so might not happen with every diner but I'm sure if requested, the great staff would do their best as they definitely did for us.The ladies both enjoyed the cocktails which they say were out of this world.Finding this restaurant is a little tricky at first as there are no signs, menu boards etc outside. The only sign is a neon sign in the shape of a pigeon which took a bit of finding at first.Booking ahead would be a good idea as they are always very busy, even without any advertising.Definitely a highlight of our trip and on the agenda when we next visit Singapore
4
In Chinatown, in a very warm atmosphere a japonese restaurant with an open kitchen were you can share and taste several plates (3 to 4 each). Test also the various cocktails which are both creative and good. Food is good as well and we out of 10 plates we tried we enjoyed 9 of them. There is only one desert but luckily it is a good on
5
Incredible food!!!!
Absolutely loved the dishes, great fusion mix and cool atmosphere.
Fantastic saki and all round great place to have dinner with friends (or date!)
5
Great atmosphere, service magical food. Listed in my favorite. The music was retro yet it fit todays vibe. Soft shell crab and bacon rice to die.
4
Love the fusion food and the vibe! Amazing menu and attentive staff.. A big expensive but worth the splurge. Would visit again!
3
Nice atmosphere in this trendy little place at the end of Keong Saik Road.We shared three small dishes, the miso paste aubergine, soft shell crab Bao and Korean fried chicken. All were very nice and beautifully presented. We also shared the scallops (very good) and the baby shrimp with sweet corn - not much flavour and a little soupy.The restaurant is filled with ex pats and ladies dressed to the nines for a girls' night out.The service is a little obtrusive, probably because we went on a Saturday night and had a two hour window to dine in - we felt a little rushed and were out with 20 minutes to spare. I think the lighting could be a little better, it was pretty dark and hard to read the menu.Total cost $S150 before drinks
5
What a gem of a restaurant in China town. We let one of the great Chefs choose several (gourmet) courses. There was not one disappointing dish. In fact we have never tasted anything like the food at the Neon Pigeon. Chef Justin explained in detail the ingredients and the process involved in delivering each delicious dish. It's not only about the food, atmosphere and great service.. try their cocktail's.. Wow. Definitely going back on our next visit
5
Recommended by a close friend, we were fresh off a flight and came into town to this funky spot in china town. Amazing food. The best cocktails in Singapore made by one of the best cocktail bartenders in the world, came 3rd in recent competitions.Plenty of good tapas type food, authentic fusion food. Fun and atmospheric and a great experience. And great service!!!!
5
Had a fantastic night at Neon Pigeon. Wonderful food and phenomenal cocktails from Sym - she's rated in the top ten cocktail creators on the planet! We tried lots of smaller dishes and never failed to be delighted. Complex yet balanced flavours abounded. Work your way through the menu.And that goes for the cocktails as well!
2
After hearing rave reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family. First off, this place IS NOT kids friendly. So do not bother bringing in young kids to dine here. There isn't much on the menu that they would like. Wait staff were not especially friendly, working more robotically than anything. Some items were unavailable and wasn't told to us when menus were given out. Prices are not inviting. Portions are small. Food is somewhat good but not special. I've heard that the cocktails here are good but I did not try them. I instead opted for a bottle of prosecco which was the only good thing of my meal. Tipping is not part of the Singaporean culture and while I do appreciate that service isn't charged, highlighting it to diners and mentioning about "tips being appreciated", is kind of low. It somehow makes you feel "obliged" to tip. Come here only if you really have no other place to go and wouldn't mind spending money.
4
The food were artistically created with a burst of flavours. There was an event that night so it was quite noisy inside, slightly difficult to hold a conversation over a group dinner. My only gripe was that we were expected to clear the table by 9.15pm, but one of our orders (a rice dish) took 40 minutes to arrive (at 8.40pm). But it was slightly understandable as it was a Friday night, and there were many orders from other tables. Overall still a good experience for us!
2
I'm going to say this again, especially to restaurateurs of hip, pretentious places who take themselves too seriously, two things: food and service. Food. Asian Fusion. I liked the tuna tartare best. The other dishes were ok. The plating I enjoyed. They use watercress in two dishes I ordered. Reminded me of Jamie Oliver's restaurant, which served every dish with sage. Service. Started out friendly enough until we requested a table change because the chairs were too low. The clueless waiter came back to me with the hostess' words verbatim: "the host said no. You refused the original table offered, so no." Was this punishment for declining the original table? Were we in boarding school? I asked to speak with the hostess but she did not come by. Instead she sent another waiter to explain why we could not change tables. That ruined my experience. When I go to a restaurant, I ask for a good meal and good service. That is all. When either one is not given, what is the point? Really.
5
I really like the food, the staff and the atmosphere, the music as well was fun.
Thank you for making our of the last nights in Singapore especial
Hunter thank you very much, Gracias and Merci beacoup
5
Really great menu always prepared to perfection! Highly recommend taking a group for a wow factor meal.
5
Awesome location, awesome staff/service, awesome atmosphere/music, and incredible menu. The tapas-style sharing plates make it easy to explore the many choices. The crab bao is a must! Complementary 5 second sake shots after the meal is a perfect way to end the night!
5
had 10 courses here and every dish was phenonomal!
Highly recommend this cool place in a fabulous area.
Go to Potato Head after for a drink on the roof, its just down the road.
5
3rd visit & never disappoints - gets better every time! Keep it up guys, love it!!!! The service, food (omg!!) drinks & each and every team member are spit on!
4
Small restaurant which is difficult to find. I love the cool and mysterious ambience. But tables might be too close to each other for privacy and comfort. Interesting food menu and tasty. I will definitely visit again!
5
We arrived at Neon Pigeon on time for booking, but as the table wasn't ready yet we had a cocktail by the bar... Didn't mind that as there's a lot to take in with the vibe and people watching.Service and food were good and swift. Personal standout dishes were the hummus and bacon rice. Staff were super fun and attention - especially the few going from table to table pouring sake down people's throats. Definitely a party starter spot.Would revisit and recommend
5
We had 6 dishes between the two of us and each one was extremely good. The Waiter was fantastic and explained what each dish was as they arrived which was great and the continuously topped up our glasses. There was great background music playing too which gave it a cool vibe. Overall we were really impressed and we will definitely be back
1
Awful terrible salty food. Every dish was salty and was not at all up to the standard expected. Very disappointed.
4
My 1st visit to Neon Pigeon and I was very impressed with the food, service and overall ambience of the restaurant. Granted, it was a Saturday night and the place was packed to the brim. Try the cocktails - they are delicious and refreshing. Food was also equally splendid! Will be back to try out more dishes
4
Stumbled across this place by chance and it was great little find serving different style Japanese food which was fresh and flavoursome. You have to try the chilly soft shell crab which was delicious. Sake flows freely at some point in the night
5
Enjoyed a night out with my husband . The food was lovely and so was the service. Great ambience, highly recommended!
4
Excellent service & foods were on point. However some dishes could be made even better with less saltines. Overall a pleasant dining experience. Definitely look forward to my second visit to Neon Pigeon!
5
Good service is not to be taken for granted in Singapore, and our experience at dinner at Neon Pigeon last night was a VERY pleasant departure from the norm. The host was friendly, chatting with us and making us feel welcome. Our server had great suggestions and always had an eye on whether we had finished our dishes or drinks to bring / offer the next one. We loved the korean fried chicken, the scallops, and the mushroom rice. Drinks were interesting and unique (although they still have my favorite rose wine by the glass - AIX!), and while nothing was a 'bargain', everything was very fairly priced. The don't include service, and perhaps that explains the extra motivation of the staff, but we felt very very well treated and tipped accordingly. Highly recommend
3
First impressions - great. Loved the decor and the overall vibe. Also liked the concept of sharing plates. Drinks options were also very wide - good selection of Japanese whiskeys, sakes and cocktails. When I first sat down, I was told there was a 2hour dining restriction but although they didn't really impose it (we just happened to want to leave within 2 hours), why bother when the restaurant wasn't full...?Food wise - some hits and misses. We had the mushroom rice which I would totally come back for. Tuna tartar was forgettable. Scallops were a bit undercooked. And we waited half an hour for our Korean Fried Chicken that was too deeply coated in flour and sauce lacked a punch. To top it off, the restaurant wasn't super packed (about 3/4 full) so not sure why we had to wait so long for a small portion of fried chicken...Servers were nice but I can't get over the half an hour wait for fried chicken. The first server we spoke to about the wait didn't seem to have remembered our request to check and we had to ask for it the second time (with the same person). Only after the third time we asked (another server) then we got our chicken... We also waited fairly long for the bill. Overall I think it was nice that the restaurant goes on a "tip as you wish policy" but for the price and quality, it was on the expensive side. I had wanted to tip (thought the servers were okay) but my friend was seriously cheesed off with the long waits at various points and we left without tipping...

I made an online reservation. They told me that they would follow up the day of the reservation, but they did not. Because of this, I missed making a reservation at a better restaurant
5
Food is deceptively simple but simply delicious, and the chefs are OCD about making sure every dish that lands on your table is perfect. Turns into a restaurant-wide party later in the evening when servers pour out free sake shots for everyone. Great cocktail and sake list. Service is prompt, polite and friendly, but it's casual. Don't go if you're looking for white tablecloths or a waiter to kowtow to you or a quiet romantic dinner
5
The food was excellent!! The bone marrow and beetroot dishes were incredible. What really made the night amazing was the service. The staff were wonderful and they made our night so enjoyable and the bill worth every penny. They were highly attentive and friendly. Shout out to Hunter and Louis!! You guys are the bomb dot com
5
Apart from spectacularly mixed drinks, that all seem to have a quirky Japanese/Asian influence, the food served here is one of the best along Keong Saik. I had a pork belly/crackling risotto dish that was out of this world. And pretty much every other dish that the staff recommended was top notch too.I'd recommend you come here for light snacks and drinks, and most of the dishes are tapas-sized and styled. So you might be hungry if you're a big eater. if not, just pack more dollar bills and chow down on more dishes
5
Excellent service and recommendations, very well looked after by the venue manager. Both the drinks and food were very innovative and have interesting flavour profiles. In particular I was very impressed with the bone marrow toast! People have said that the Singapore F&B scene has stepped up a lot recently and this is a perfect example of it
5
Great vibe and atmosphere, excellent service by staff and food was delicious. Cool design and fit out, we would recommend to our friends.

Great atmosphere and perfect setting for a group of friends. The place has a lot of character and stands out in Singapore. Top quality service to finish it all off!

The hummus is to die for! Brussel sprouts as well! Bacon rice order quickly cause they run out! Make sure you get a cocktail! Great vibes but beware the sake waiter

Came down here to celebrate birthday with my girlfriend. Great food and cocktails. Service is excellent as well.
5
Service can sometimes be lacking in Singapore. Not here. Excellent all round. Food was very good, edamame infused hummus, great tuna tartare, shiitake mushroom dish, wow

not terrible, but really hoped it would be better. was not impressed by the food - especially for the price.

Visiting Singapore from Australia and Canada with a local friend and stopped by here on the recommendation of a Canadian friend. Was not disappointed. Three of had a couple of cocktails and 10 small plates. Definitely ordered a dish or two too many. Food was incredible, though, with appealing twists on more traditional Japanese izakaya. Of the 10 dishes, not a single one that we didn't think was a fantastic sampling.Service was attentive, fast, and friendly. Only (minor) annoyance was we were feeling a bit harassed to order drinks, being asked if we wanted another drink when we were only half way through the previous. I learned later from my local friend that this is not unusual for Singapore, so this was likely more a cultural difference.Only feedback was the online booking system (Chope) is confusing. Received an email after booking saying that the reservation was not yet confirmed but booked. Never received a confirmation but had a booking when we arrived so it ended well

Went here for my birhtday celebration,It is a pleasant place situated at town.The service was good and meals reasonably price!From to moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome. The service and food cannot be faulted. I highly recommend this for any special occasion, you won't be disappointed!Highly recommend for dish and cocktail Tokyo Hummus & Softshell Crab Bao. Cocktails- Painapurru & Pika-

A restaurant good for hanging out with a group of friends over small plates and cocktail. Lots of noise and buzz. Recommended to take 7-8 plates for 2 persons. We ordered 6 plates and was a bit too much for us. Generally the food was salty. We both went home drinking lots of water. Service can be improved in paying more attention to the cutlery needed especially when guests are sharing. Out of the 6 dishes, we liked Smoked Baby Back Ribs and Soft Shell Crab Bao.

[TLDR: A door minder who was more busy being obsequious to tourists and foreigners.]As we entered the restaurant slightly after 10pm, a party of four had just vacated. Unfortunately, the malay door minder told us "we're full". The restaurant was clearly not full, so I pointed to the empty table and asked if those were available. The answer? "We can't let you have those till the kitchen closes." I responded that we were there for drinks, to which he said we'd have to stand, and walked off. After a check with the bar staff later, we found out that the kitchen would close in less than 30 mins.We stuck around for one drink, enough to realise the table remained empty, and the door minder not once offered us to transfer seats, or check on us. Instead, he humoured himself by chatting with the kitchen staff who were clearly busy (as the kitchen was still 'open'), and with some customers who were also hitting on the Chinese waitress.What are pity, that a respectable establishment could not achieve a decent level of customer service.If you're here for good food and drink, and service is important to you, do yourself a favour and go elsewhere. If you're loaded, clearly not local, have a good accent, you may just find this place a blast. Especially when the local minder treats you like king.Best,one star for the decent bartende

Cocktail weird, food is nice, some dishes too salty in taste, especially Korean chicken. Tall table gives good overall view of the restaurant but table is just too small. Got to be very careful not to spill your drink or food on your date
5
The whole meat menu was incredible, specially the ribs and the duck was to die for! Also be ready for some serious drinking with this special cocktail menu!
5
Great food, wicked drinks, awesome service. Don't miss out on this amazing new spot in town. Get Symphony to make you a special drink...the spicy mango bourbon sour!
5
It has been a few months and my tongue was so pleased again. And kudos to Symphonies amazing cocktails. Another great night.
Please Tsykune sliders and chicken liver must come back!:)

Good service, ok food, enjoyed the atmosphere. Overall, a good experience. What else do you guys want me to say, i don't get the 'min 100 character' thing...

Reviewed great reviews for this. Yes is a cool little place and the service is good. But expected the food to be better.
Best dish was the ribs.
Wouldn't go back but was happy to try
Service is fantastic.

The worst place I have been to in Singapore if you have a specific dietary requirement. As vegetarians, we were served food with fish sauce, chicken floss, and I can only imagine what else. When I complained to the waiter, he went to the kitchen to double check, coming back with the following response 'I have confirmed with the kitchen that your food is vegetarian, the sauce is made with bonito flakes and aji no moto' - i.e tuna and MSG! I couldn't believe the sheer cluelessness of the staff. When we asked to then speak to the manager, as we were not going to get anywhere with a waiter like this, we were sent a waiter with a bottle of sake. Are you for real?! Unattentive, uncaring, and uneducated service. On the plus side, the cocktails were decent
3
Liked: - good Japanese fusion food, if you like that. Especially the beetroot cured salmon (gravlax?), roasted bone marrow with roast garlic and furikake to die for, delicious soft shell crab in soft taco, and pan roasted sea bass in wakame.- Service very attentive, but not always thoughtful.- ambience and decor is uber cool except music is too loud.Disliked:- very loud music so hard to hear (even after asking to turn it down) and for this reason alone i would not return.- big sake and whisky drinks menu, small wine list: 2 white and 2 red, although US Chardy was good; many original fusion cocktails if that's what you like but no classics.Recommend great bars along the street before dining

We were welcoming back a friend and thought this place would be a fab place to host him, as we had a fab experience on our first visit. The service is still wonderful as the staff are very attentive, and its always easy to get someone's attention, always ready with a smile and to check with orders, and so polite and your water glasses are never left empty. I suppose because there's no service charge, and you tip only if you find their service worthy.The let down was the chicken liver pate (served in a small mason jar) has been taken off the menu. Its replacement, the chicken liver mousse didn't do it justice. There should be a petition to bring back the chicken liver pate!!!The other let down was the resto was not serving the roasted baby back ribs that evening (Maybe a ruse to make sure we come back and try it?)THE MUST TRY: Crispy soft shell crab bao (makes you want to order 2 more portions!). Braised beef cheeks: So tender, the meat just melts in your mouthSparkling sake: Always so wonderful, I can drink bottles of it!!AVERAGE:Korean fried chicken, pan roasted grouper, candied octopusThe music is also very loud, so talking among bigger groups may be hard....But we did get a dose of free sake, as one of the staff went around with a bottle and pour it down our willing throats...

We went there as some friends had gone there already and so many people are recommending it. In the end we went home frustrated and disappointed. Some of the staff is clearly not well trained on many levels and more than half of the dishes turned out to be not what we expected. We thought it would be something like FOC or the like, but it's not the case. In our opinion it's overhyped and not worth its money. Some dishes were too spicy, others tasteless, really not what we had expected. Don't get me wrong, the interior is nice and some of the dishes were quite OK, but I would not go there again. And to add to this: the toilet was a complete disaster, a big shame on the restaurant for having a dirty and disgusting toilet like that. And given that we were the second or third couple entering the place, it's clear that the toilets had not been cleaned since lunch. An incredible shame for a place that is creating such high expectations with the vibe and marketing they're trying to do
5
An amazing drinks and dinner with friends. Service was outstanding with great knowledge of products especially their cocktails. Every single dishes were so amazing. Funky and hip vibe from the deco to the music. A great place to hangout.
5
Neon Pigeon is not quiet and secluded, it's fun, noisy and the food is absolutely amazing! Really creative spins on European and Asian classics which were all delicious.
5
Neon Pigeon has a wide choice of food which tastes great, a zesty ambience and very well located in Chinatown next to bars that you can visit after. I strongly recommend it.
5
Best service and food in Singapore. Would highly recommend all dishes. Service was fantastic, location great and ambiance excellent.
5
Have eaten in the restaurant a number of times now, and it never disappoints, I love the ambience, I love the pace and I love the food. Mike and his team have done an excellent job, and we will continue to use the place often.
5
All items on this menu are really interesting and the food more than lives up to its description. The simple things are very good, such as the Brussel sprouts. Good cocktails but limited wine list. Highly recommended.
4
It's not my first time here but I've always been really impressed with the service, all the staff are excellent. Menu is truly varied and all the dishes I've tried are delicious. Cocktails are fabulous also, plus they update their food and drink menus regularly to keep things fresh. Thoroughly recommended for a night out with friends or even for a fun date. Music can get a bit loud as the night goes on which makes talking across the table difficult
5
With so much choice in Singapore, Neon Pigeon came highly recommended as a venue to experience while we attended Food & Hotel Asia'16 in Singapore. Symphony behind the bar treated us to some fine Japanese single malts before indulging us with awesome cocktails. Young Aussie chef Justin and the kitchen team dished out great well balanced modern Japanese sharing dishes bursting with flavour, colour, balance and texture. Well done to Andrew and the entire team. Our team from Australia will be back

I visited Neon Pigeon for dinner with my boyfriend one evening in May. Upon entering the restaurant, there is no denying it exudes a Shoreditch, London cool vibe. The interior is street art mixed with industrial flair. None of the white linen table cloth, rigid and clinical interior of a fine dining restaurant. Neon Pigeon offers eating and drinking on one place. And it is surprisingly very good at both. The bartenders are very creative and knowledgeable. One of them asked me what I normally like in a drink and I said I feel like drinking something sweet, fresh and with berries. He came back with the most delicious cocktail I have ever tasted in a Buddha shaped white ceramic glass! The drink is so fresh and tasted of freshly picked and mashed Raspberries. The food was a delight too! I would describe the cuisine as world food as it has both Asian and Western influences. A big hit was the Brussel sprouts with mirin glazed bacon and the chicken liver mousse served with a super thin and crunchy toast and Yuzu marmalade. We also ordered the Japanese bouillabaisse which is a hearty soup of cockles and halibut in ramen broth. The restaurant staff here are also very engaging and friendly. They are always up for a chat and a joke and we were very well looked after. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely come back here again especially for a special celebration or even just to celebrate the weekend

What a funky place! The menu is designed to be shared with lots of small plates - we tried the bone marrow, ribs and duck bao. Fit to bust it was delicious. The cocktails were also spectacular - the chili one refreshing and zinging at the same time. Yu
5
This place is epic! Chilled atmosphere, reasonable pricing. The food is a unique twist on traditional Japanese cuisine. For example they had this edamame hummus which was epic. Definitely the best Japanese food i've ever had. I'm definitely coming back when i'm in SG next!
4
Had dinner with my girls few weeks back after some people mentioned how good is the place. They serve Japanese fushion food in a small plates (tapas). Gotta say, love the ambience, interior, drinks but food overall is "nothing special". We tried about 8-9 dishes because all sounds interesting, but turns out not as stand as out as it names. Great place to hang out though slightly price
4
Food is great, has a modern twist on Japanese food, very tasty. Highly recommend the ribs and Edamame Hummus yummy, we took our kids along for an early dinner and although not child friendly they where very helpful and very friendly, great service and lovely staff, on top of great food. Location is fantastics.Will come back without the kids next time :

I went in as a single, not sure they would seat me, as I had no reservation and a single is not usually accepted at an izakaya. However, the staff could not have been more gracious. I was seated right away and after a few minutes of browsing the menu, my server came over to make suggestions. His suggestions were appropriate and not at all overly aggressive, no upselling. He listened to what I wanted from the meal, then steered me to what turned out to be some awesome choices.I started with beetroot cured salmon. The salmon was flawless, with the perfect amount of dressing and crunchy bits to balance the smooth fish. Second course was roasted cauliflower with shredded spring onions on a thick yuzu sauce. This was far and away my favorite dish of the evening - I had one of those, "if no one was looking I would lick this plate" moments. Next up, miso butter basted baby shrimp. The shrimp were tiny but not super-baby sized, which I appreciated. They were perfectly cooked, sizzling, and plentiful. Last course was bacon rice with runny egg. By the time I got to this course I was pretty full, so I wasn't in the perfect frame of mind (or stomach) to enjoy this as much, but it had good flavor, though perhaps it was a little thick or heavy. All of the food was elevated without being fussy or overly wrought. There were so many interesting choices on the menu, I really do wish I had been able to dine with two or three companions, so we could have tried everything. I think we would not have been disappointed. I did have one drink, a sake cocktail (forgot the name) which was pricy ($25 SGD) as all cocktails are in Singapore, but the difference here was that this drink definitely had an alcohol kick! Even though I only had the one drink, and I nursed it through my whole meal, I left feeling as if I had had two or three drinks.As others have mentioned, the music level is kind of high, but it is definitely in line with the vibe of the place, and it didn't bother me at all. If you make a reservation, you may want to ask for a regular or high table, not one of the low tables with overstuffed chairs, which are located right near the entrance. I saw staff attempt to seat a few parties at those tables, and they all ended up asking to be moved - looks like a great place for a drink and quick bite if you are bar-hopping, but if your intent is to have a full meal and linger, those seats did not look particularly comfortable.Whether you call it izakaya, tapas, or meze, this is definitely sharing food, and the more people in your party, the more you will be able to enjoy. But as a solo diner, I'm glad I decided to go to Neon Pigeon, and I hope that it will still be there when I make my next trip to Singapore
5
Service was top-notch - the staff was friendly and well-trained. Food was excellent! I highly recommend the octopus, cauliflower, bone-marrow, chicken liver mousse, bacon rice and ribs. Love the alcohol selection! We didn't have to wait long for food to arrive and music was good too. I'd definitely come back again and again
5
Love Neon Pigeon, been here many times and most items on the menu are great. Everything is for sharing. My favorites are the cauliflower, tuna tartare, and even though it almost seems out of place and a bit of a guilty pleasure, the Korean fried chicken is amazing! I just find the wines slightly pricey at $19 a glass (since I don't drink cocktail but if you do they should be pretty good). The setting of the restaurant is very hip and trendy, the only downside is it's a bit on the loud side so makes it a bit hard to talk. But other than that it's a great restaurant for a casual but nice dinner with friends.
5
There are tap's and tapa's, but at Neo Pigeon this is done in a very exquisite way. Great choices which go way beyond the traditional ones. The staff is well trained and give good guidance and what is the best to order in both sense of specialty and number of dishes. The protions are also very reasonable, so you definitely do not go hungry.You should also try there host of specialty beers.Be careful: You can't make reservations. But people coming here are not staying for hours, so the flow rate is good. Obviously Thursday's Friday's and Saturday's are quite full
5
I'd been hearing rave reviews about this place for a while and finally made it down to check it out for myself. The place is the Best. Best food. Best Bar. Best Service. It's hard to find a cool haunt that can hold it down on all front, especially in Singapore, and we were not disappointed. Bonus points:1) The Killer Playlist: on the night we went the sake was flowing and they were blasting Snoop and Biggy like it was 1999. #TBT in all the right ways. 2) The Restaurant Owners: Cute, Cute and Cute. The 3 founders were in the house on the night we went and Hello Handsome(s)! Every table seemed like a party and it was largely due to how pleasant and accommodating they were as hosts. Gorgeous and gregarious! To all the single ladies: keep your eyes peeled for the sexy/sporty half Asian named Mike, and the make-you-swoon Indian Jude Law, Rohit

After 5 years in this city I have finally found a restaurant that has everything I love: amazing food, great ambiance, cool music, good service, reasonable prices for the quality and original cocktails.Truly a gem.It is very well located too, in the increasingly popular Keong Saik Road. Walking distance from Duxton hill, China Town and even the Central Business District.I recommend it to all my friends, colleagues and visitors. And even my boss has become a regular. GO
4
This restaurant was on my 'To-Do' list for some time now and it did not disappoint me. Convenient located at the Keong Saik road between the renovated shop houses. We made a booking through Chope and when we arrived there 30 min earlier there were already tables available. The service was very good. The staff gave us some time to read the menu and than gave us some good advise. Beware not to rock your chair...we saw 2 ppl crash on the ground because their chairs broke. You might say that their food is that good......Food The platters are for sharing and we liked all the dishes. My top-down list:Smoked ribs - Must have ...good smokey taste, soft meat falls of the boneOctopus - Must have ...soft light chewy and tenderCauliflower - It has a light sourness because of the Yuzu and it goes well with the grill tasteBacon rice - It got house smoked chewy bacon ...niceEdamamee Hummus - plenty of spices ....and garlic...also nicePan seared seabrass - tasty DecorationThe restaurant has the right lighting and plays 90-00 music. The music is a loud but you can still have a conversation.Good for couples, friends and business lunches/dinner
5
Neon Pigeon was our best restaurant experience in Singapore. We loved the Japanese hummus, brussels sprouts, eggplant with lotus crisps, chicken liver pate, Korean chicken. Great cocktails too, and highly attentive and friendly service. Will definitely come back next time we are in town!

Good food, good vibe, this new kid on the block was buzzing on a Friday evening. The way to identify this place was by the literal neon pigeon light box at the entrance. The cocktails were tasty and the few plates we got to order to share were tasty. The experience stopped there for us because service was an absolute let down... 1) we were not told about the 2-hours time allowance to dine when being seated by the manager 2) they insisted that this information was made known to us via the confirmation notice they sent - NIL 3) when we first ordered, the obnoxious waiter didn't highlight that to us when we mentioned we would order more later - he only rudely said that there might be a long wait if we didn't choose to order all our dishes at that time4) he came by our table in 5-mins intervals to ask if we wanted to order more. The straw that broke the camel's back was when he came back to our table again just 2 mins after he had come by to ask if we wanted to order more, and when we said we are still going and my friend had just ordered another whisky - he quickly said "alright I'll bring you your bill"!!! When I asked what his issue was because we obviously still had food on the table - full plate of ribs too, he told us very rudely that we only have two hours to dine. Now we obviously still had heaps to finish, and by friend a whole glass of whiskey to go through. Does management think it's fair for us to up and move to the bar with no seats to finish the rest of our food??? To the waiter, thanks for ruining our Friday night with your HORRIBLE service. Not going back unless service improves or staff are at least taught to have more tact and practise some flexibility.
4
Visited on a Friday night with my partner. Service was very good and the atmosphere was buzzing. The food was slightly hit and miss - we really enjoyed the duck bao, tuna tartare, hummus and KFC but not so much the pumpkin and zucchini rice. The rice in particular had a strong bitter lemon flavour and also a strong truffle flavour though the waiter insisted there was no truffle in it. Cocktails were excellent.Total price for 7 sharing plates and 4 cocktails was $173. Not cheap but would have been much cheaper without the cocktails

My husband and I just happen to stumble upon this place when our usual favorite bar was closed when we decided to have a cocktail night. To our delight, we ended up really happy with many things about Neon Pigeon. #1, service is top notch. Everybody’s friendly, especially the bar tender ;) on our third cocktail, we had a shot of sake with him saying his congratulations for us making it to the 3rd round! Same is true with the bar manager. He is very lively and is always keeping short conversations lively. #2 Drinks are well mixed. Not stingy at all with the percent of alcohol. I’m sensitive to this since I am not very happy getting an alcoholic drink whereas the so-called alcohol percent is basically non-existent! Price ranges from 16-22 Sgd. Not the cheapest, but then again, in SG nothing is cheap anyway ☺ What I love about it is that at least, we get quality drinks! #3 Ambiance is very much likeable – very cozy. Music, in my opinion is a bit too loud (but then again, it’s just my personal preference). Reviewing the menu that seems to be very promising, my husband and I agreed that we’ll be back from time to time and enjoy not only the drinks but more so, we are looking forward to try their “birdfeed” section. Following visits will definitely be with our friends ;) Highly recommended

Went to the Neon Pigeon on a business trip with a bunch of colleagues. Loved everything about the place. The food was terrific. We shared many small plates so we could sample lots of different dishes for appetizers and for the meal. Each dish was excellent. The edamame humus and Hamachi appetizers were a big hit. The beef cheeks entry was incredible. Throw in a good selection of beers and cocktails and you have a full night. The service was good and the staff was great. A great find in the middle of Singapore
5
we stumbled upon the Neon Pigeon on a Monday evening. the ambiance looked inviting and the waiter was really kind so we decided to try it. Neon Pigeon did not disappoint.the menu was interesting, suggested japanese fusion. the presentation of the dishes were pretty and 5 out of the 6 tapas size items completely blew our minds! very tasty, vibrant food! the service was a little slow, however the waiters and waitresses were super attentive. when they asked about the experience so far, we only had 2 dishes served, thus we mentioned that service could be faster.they immediately addressed the notice and started bringing out the food + we received 2 rounds of complimentary sake for the delay. most outstanding service i've experienced in Singapore so far! very pleased and will be back
3
Fun vibe, good cocktails and attentive friendly service. The food though was hit and miss and aside for the sliders, nothing struck us as amazing. Definitely glad we went to check it out but competition is fierce in this area and Neon Pigeon needs to improve the food.
4
I just fell in love with this place ! They have the best cocktails I ever tasted ! I was there on a Friday night, it was a little bit packed but the music and the cuban rum were all I needed to have a good time. Loved the ambiance and the nice staff ! ps: the only way to find this place is to look for a .... neon pigeon :
5
We had our dinner here a while back cause we heard good things about it. The food was great because it was for sharing so we get to eat 7-8 plates between 4 of us. The drinks were good and the services are great. The only problem is that there's no reservations so you really gotta go early to secure a spot.Out of all the dishes I remember the buns with duck or braised pork was really good. You should order that one :) The Korean Fried Chicken wasn't particularly impressive even thought it was recommended
5
Dined here last month while on a trip through Singapore, at the recommendation of a local friend. Its a 'Japanesey' concept with really funky interior, good music, great cocktails and amazing food. The way the tables are set out next to the open kitchen with the bar on the opposite side is good as you feel like you're in the middle of the action. Went two nights in a row because I wanted to try the whole menu! Stand outs were the wasabi margaritas, the bone marrow dish which was so tasty and totally original, there was a tuna avocado jelly entree that really stood out also. You have to go and check it out, book though - as it seems like it gets pretty busy, & rightly so
4
Cool place for the younger audience, with very friendly waiters, who spend talking time with guests. Food good, but felt expensive for what it was, and drinks (wine) was also expensive.
4
Nice lively izakaya bar atmosphere with friendly knowledgeable staff and delicious small plates. Good selection of sakes.
3
Nice enough place and food but not outstanding. Similar tastes to a lot of dishes. Overwhelmingly noisy. Better places around.
5
super flavorful food, great vibe and cocktails, friendly and attentive service, for a change in Singapore!
4
Though perhaps a little overpriced. Really enjoyed the meals we had - the pork belly was amazing. The decor was great to look at and worked well with the atmosphere. The drinks - the drinks. They were bloody fantastic. I had some green cocktail thing that tasted like heaven. Maybe that's why I spent so much. Would go again (maybe after pay day). Also note: the chilli cocktail is pretty spicy
4
Dinner for 3 on a Monday night. Compact but varied menu with a short list of daily specials. Restaurant recommends 7-8 tasting plates for 2. 9 was enough for 3 unless you are really hungry.Highlights: Cold cucumber with sesame past dressing, confit salmon, char-gilled brussel sprouts with bacon. Very decent selection of japanese craft beers. All served with flourish by attentive and energetic crew.And the surprise: probably the best rack of ribs I have ever tasted. Smoked all day before grilling for a crisp, caramelised finish. Gorgeous meaty flavour with none of the gristle of everyday ribs. The essence of finger-licking food. So good we went back for more. WowNo bookings so get there early and expect to hang out in the cosy bar corner or streetside bar
5
This Japanese inspired restaurant is now open for a few months and is one (if not THE) the best table in town by a long shot. Food is outstanding, music is trendy, staff is great. No reservation policy means you will have to wait for a table but luckily there are a few bar guys who will happily entertain you while you wait.Favorites on the menu are the 48hr marinated pork shoulder (advance order required), tuna tartare, chicken sliders, cucumber, spare ribs and the spicy meatloaf. Drink wise the white sauvignon blanc is excellent, but clearly they prefer you to drink sake, beer or a cocktail as wine menu is tiny... Whisky sour is great! If you have no idea what you want to drink let the bartenders surprise you with a show performanc

Neon Pigeon has set a standard for all restaurants in Singapore to aspire to.We first tried the restaurant as a group of 4 for dinner. Walking in the atmosphere of the place makes you feel like you have left Singapore and ended up somewhere like Hong Kong or Surry Hills in Sydney.The service is excellent, warm smiles, friendly chat and a genuine customer care.The food that we ordered was all to share. Small tasty meals to begin with followed by similar mains. There is plenty of choices on the menu with a lot of variety depending on your preferences. The meals aren't big but due to the menu being reasonably priced you always have the option of ordering more and trying a number of things.The wine list is excellent as are the cocktails. There is an extensive SAKE list as well.Our experience at Neon Pigeon was all class. We highly recommend this restaurant
5
I love this place. Their award winning bartenders make drinks off menu based on your flavor preferences. "I'd like something with a little citrus and a little chocolate" and BAM here come one of my new favorite drinks! It's pure entertainment watching them make the cocktails and the drinks are really delicious. They are masterpieces in a glass. Their menu is fantastic. We went with friends and had the server bring out whatever he recommended. The pumpkin rice was amazing, chilled cucumber exceeded our expectations and we loved the baby back ribs. Everything was great. Staff is fun and friendly - something you don't find a lot in SG.
5
Myself and my wife had dinner here last night with a friend who recommended it. The first thing I noticed was the level service, which was brilliant. From the warmest welcome to the barman making special cocktails for us. The food was excellent, we had about 10 different small dishes which we shared, more than enough for three people. This is a brilliant place with a fantastic vibe equally at home in London or Tokyo. This is a great unique place to eat and drink in Singapore
5
This is not a 5 star dining experience - it's a new funky restaurant that recently opened on Keong Saik. You feel like you are in the meatpacking district or Soho, great vibe, great service, can't wait to go back with the missus.
5
Great little find. The food is extraordinary on taste, flavours and combinations. The ambience is upbeat and welcoming with phenomenal staff. Highly recommended before it gets crazy to get dinner reservations.
5
Super trendy very popular Japanese/Chinese tapas size share plates. Expensive but worth it. We shared 4 dishes between 2 of us. And am not sure how we could have managed the 7/8 they recommend for 2. Each dish delicious and worthy of a photo.
5
Party of 7 for dinner turned out to be an enjoyable event Despite the no reservations policy, we managed to get seats in a reasonable time, entertaining ourselves to edamame, green peppers and sliders whilst waiting. This is a casual resto, and sharing dishes is what one does Octopus salad, baby back ribs, kurobuta pork, duck breast, mashed eggplant, grilled brussel sprouts with pancheta, and mushrooms stallions. All excellent, washed down with copious daiginjo shu.Dessert however is missable, Service was attentive and warm.
4
Good food enjoyed in a great ambiance. You feel the great vibe as you order the room and the staff are very energetic and with a great smile. Nice cocktail bar where you can wait for your friends or just start the night. Was there in a big group and managed to taste most of the menu and was pleased with all of it. The only small minus is the wine list. There is not much to choose from, but I guess it has to do with the focus on Sake
4
Currently the hottest ticket in Keong Saik Road, the service here is truly impressive. Everyone on the floor knows what they're doing and nothing is too much trouble. It's hip without trying too hard, and as the volume goes up through the evening it has a lot of what the Irish would call "craik".The small plate concept is an expensive way to dine out if you're a table looking to eat heartily, but suits the focus here on the cocktails and beers. The dishes here all tend to be big on flavour but a tiny bit salty, because that works better with drinks.They don't take bookings for tables of less than 8, and the place starts getting packed around 7.30pm, so you might want to consider going early or late
4
Came here for dinner as a party of four, they ask for everyone to be present before they seat you so two of us hung out at the bar first. We tried two cocktails which were unmemorable with no kick. The food was loads better, just the right amount of seasoning, Japanese influences with creative twists. Even the baby back ribs were tender, juicy and not overly salty. Nothing was too salty, a lot of izakaya-type places pack on the salt. Come early, the place was full later on. Great background music, Notorious B.I.G. and the like. Hip wall art. Service was well-mannered and always with a smile. The place is not cheap (about ~SGD100 pax for the 4 of us), we each had two drinks and were sufficiently full. No service charge, so you can add on the tip. Good place for couples or small groups (4 was about right)

Neon Pigeon is a funky bar/restaurant serving japanese fusion cuisine - food is available in bar size or full portion but still not a large portion if shared between a group of 5 people. Was there to celebrate a friend's birthday-open kitchen concept and the cons is that you leaving the place reeking of the food smell but the quality of the food is all worth it. Reservations only allowed for a party of more than 8-first come first serve basis. Unless all parties arrive otherwise you won't be given a proper table.  We tried the following:1. Cold grilled squid salad - Hit2. Marinated Hamachi - my personal favorite - served with ume somen noodles-a must try 3. Smoked Pork Buns-Hit4. Miso Black Cod-nay; Miss5. Crispy Brussels Sprouts-Hit6. Charred Carrots and Parsnips-nay-miss7. Pan Roasted Grouper-Hit8. Smoked Baby Back Ribs-Miss9. Miso Roasted Pumpkin-Hit10. Dessert-assortment of chocolate, lemon and pistachio nuts-Hit!!!Food wasn't cheap and we ended paying about $80 each without alcohol-we had 2 glasses of coke light. Overall verdict - definitely worth a first try but will not visit the 2nd time. There are many other restaurants worth exploring. Definitely a place to be seen and to see

The only time to get into this place is early -i t is now ultra trendy with all Singapore's hippest and hottest lining up for a table. The down side to all this - and I can see why from their logistics point of view - is that you can't get a table until you are all there. I had to wait on my own, sipping a rather gorgeous cocktail it has to be said, while husband did some chores. Once we sat down we chose 6 small dishes between the two of us which was perfect, expensive, but perfect. We had the octopus, aubergine, tuna tartare special, ribs - really wonderful, grouper and duck (the least good of all the dishes, a bit overdone for my taste, and bland compared to all the other mouth-tingling flavours we had on offer). The service is second-to-none, the girls all gorgeous - funny that - but you do feel under pressure to move on fast as the sausage machine gets going. The food arrives within minutes of ordering and I felt slightly guilty just sipping my drink after we had finished when I saw the crowds lining up (having been an unsuccessful - or rather too impatient - queuer a few weeks back). Still a fun place to go, maybe go elsewhere like the Cufflink Club for some cocktails after - not before - or you wont get in

I love this spot- no place like it in Singapore. It has a clean industrial yet homey feel, with wall art that looks like hells angels on acid. Seats about 70 people. I like the communal sliding tables with high stool seating.Excellent miso pumpkin rice with garlic & egg yolk: paella meets Japanese risotto. If you like bone marrow then you must try it here. Miso cod soup, mushrooms & grilled Shishito are my favorites. Duck is good too.Cocktails are amazing and good value for money vs. other bars in the area. Highly recommend the kyoho fizz drink. This is one of my fav regular hangouts- casual & chill. Friendly staff. Good place for dinner then drinks in the neighborhood. They don't take reservations
