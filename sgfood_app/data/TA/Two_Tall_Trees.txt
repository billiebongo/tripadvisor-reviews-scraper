The food there is awesome, just that it is a bit of a pricey.
Definitely going back there again for the food.
Service is great, they are polite and patient.
Looking forward to go again!

Lattes are excellent! Tomatoes could have been roasted but it was a pleasant experience for my parents who don't usually patronise at caf√®s.

Went for brunch! Tried their Breakfast Plate and The Fried Chicken with Waffles and Ice cream! The scrambled eggs were on point :D the fried chicken tasted surprisingly good with the ice cream! The waffles was the best!

Has a decent range of teas and coffees including one flavoured with coconut oil. Breakfast sets are quite tasty and so are the burgers but be prepared to pay about SGD $20+ for a main and drink.

Heard about it and decided to give it a try yesterday. No regrets! We enjoyed the food. I chose the Build Your Breakfast set - Brioche bread, scrambled eggs, Angus beef sausage and pork Bratwurst. It was delicious! Came with tomatoes so juicy and refreshing. Best tomatoes I had ever eaten! Cookie N Cream Milkshake was also heavenly :)Recommended

Food portions were good for the price. Ordered a mushroom olio which was flavourful. Spicy sticky wings with curry sauce was good. But too much sauce made the wings soggy after a while. Wagyu patty burger was so-so, cooked well but the patty had no flavour or seasoning. Staff helpful. Will revisit.

Saturday afternoon, we were the only ones in the restaurant which is quite a pleasant place. Waitress was very friendly and professional. The waffles were very nice, pasta bollognaise was mediocre (not bad but nothing special), great breakfast. However the service was was horrendously slow, dishes came out one at a time and the 4th dish only after the rest of us finished...and this is when we were the only table.I'd come back for waffles and only when not in a hurry

our family of four had a delightful dinner here on a weekday. The decor was casual but very comfortable. The service despite being a cafe very friendly and knowledgeable. The menu has an American flare with solid classics like Spaghetti bolognaise (very well prepared like in an italian restuarant, wayu burger or build yoru own. The burger was juicy and done to perfection with tasty home fries and well seasoned side salad. I also enjoyed the craft beers available here. The restrooms were modern and spotlessly clean ( a really rarity these days). To top it all off free wifi ! I also observed that they had an extensive breakfast menu with waffles, fired chicken and bacon which I hope to try next time. Simply said, a chic comfortable cafe with good standard food and some nice american diner touches. Its suitable for couples, families and all meals. They even said a cheery goodbye as we lef

Food was not fantastic, had their big breakfast with topups of hashbrown, sausage which was slightly cold inside still, additional ONE piece of sourdough toast (+$1.50) which came in a tiny piece of baguette lookalike that was hard like stone. Found a dead cockroach on the floor next to our table as well, cleanliness needs to be worked on. Will probably not return here again

This little cafe tucked away in Serangoon Gardens has a tasty cafe menu. But the star of the menu has to be the truffle fries and BBQ wings. I would recommend the spicy option if you like a little heat on your wings. Saucy and crunchy! Lip-smacking good. Also, this is a place that knows coffee. So if you live in the area and are looking for a local coffee bean supplier this is the place to go!
