We came here and were not sure about the food, but were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, aroma, flavor and presentation. We tried Hunker Bengedi and Kuzu Tandir.
5
The place it was easy to find and comfortable ,we been one time and food very good .they are have good service .
2
The place was nice and clean, the plating was not bad but the taste of the food was not as great, normal. We have tasted better for the same price point.
4
Greatly enjoyed the food and the ambiance. The 1-for-1 voucher from The Entertainer makes it a very affordable fine dining experience providing good value and satisfaction.
4
Good place to chill with friends as not so crowded. Food was not bad, atmosphere was good, worth a try
4
The Chilean sea bass, pan fried to perfection on a bed of local spinach and sprinkle with salmon roe on top was something special.
3
Nice ambience and the set lunch is really value for money. The food on the a la carte menu is limited with popular item like pork cheeks not available. Servers did not inform us of any credit card promotion when we were ordering. However, the chef allows us to take away the free main course. A nice gesture indeed. Food is slightly above average for a small establishment
1
Lamb was minuscule, medium rare beef too hard, chicken too salty, fish too mushy. Desserts were also an absolute let down. Worse than cafe desserts and costing double the price. Thank God for the entertainer app but even with that the food was just not worth the price. Not recommended
3
The salad on set menu was great. Soup was not hot, it's lukewarm. Main course vegetarian pasta was good but thought presentation could be better. Boneless leg was good but rice is not warm and taseteless. Ordered two starters was good- kurobuta and scallops. Service was great and accomodatin

For those who purchase voucher, SELA will charge u based on their menu. We did point the voucher and order for their striploin $28 , we order 2 set and order 1 additional set chicken leg confit $22 from their menu(their offer is 1 for 1 main course based on their equal or less value) . End up they charge us based on their lasted menu $40 each for Angus striploin for 2 set and $22 for chicken confit( 1 for 1 under offer) . They push the responsible to "their marketing side" and mention is ar changing their menu Every 3 month. This will be the only time to visit them and I definitely will no recommend any1 to dine in

Was ok. Nothing special. Wish the wine list by the glass was longer. Food wasn't that great to order a whole bottle.
5
Food is good and service is excellent (not so common to see this in Singapore. Manager is very friendly.
4
Ambience was great. Food was simply but flavours were rather sophisticated. It is however a little overpriced given the portions and not particularly impressive food to match. Overall, a safe option for a date.
4
Good food, great ambience, amazing service, quiet enough to have a conversation with my date and amazing deals available
2
Sela was fantastic a year ago. I visited it twice a year ago and was really happy with the menu and food. A year later, it's deteriorated. Their lunch menu (although very affordable at $15.90) did nothing to showcase the cuisine they were known for.
5
Service was good n food is of good standard. Has a nice range of wine n beer. Ambience is pretty nice.
2
Only 2 tables including mine at that time. Service was way too fast. Should have allowed more time in between to consume in other to have a more pleasant experience. Had to told them to slow down the food so i had time to finish off the soup. Staff were hiding at the back and didnt bother to come clear the plates when we are done. Had to call them instead. 2 tables and service was already mess up. I cannot imagine a full hse. Probably thats why it wasnt crowded on a holiday.... never going back for sure
3
Passed by this restaurant when it was crowded and became curious. Finally went there for dinner on a weekend, and it wasn't crowded anymore. The angel hair pasta aglio olio was al dente and delicious, while my main course of lamb rack was ok, not outstanding. The Caesar salad and desserts (we had mixed berries panna cotta and gula Melaka creme) were overpriced at $15 each. Service was prompt but the food came too fast and all together. The place is quite noisy due to the cement floors and minimalist decor. My friends had the baked miso Chilean sea bass and were not wowed over by it. We had a free bottle of red wine from a Citibank card promotion, so that kept the costs down. Overall it was an average experience.
4
Great little find. Food was fantastic, definitely try the sea bass. Service was good but unfortunately the whole experience felt a little rushed. The restaurant is supposed to stay open until 23:00 but as we were the last people in that evening we were politely hustled out around 22:15.
4
Visited for lunch. When we first entered the restaurant, it has a fishy smell which was a bit surprising but just for a short while. Excellent deals at this restaurant. We went for the New year lunch deal at 23++ which is almost unimaginable. Had the soup which was average in a sense it's almost like knorr soup except for some fresh corns in the soup. The main is excellent. Tender and juicy tenderloin. Simple vanilla ice with some fresh and semi fried fruits for dessert. Staffs were also very attentive Overall, no complains for the value we are getting.
3
The oyster mushroom (starter) tasted good but the their beef (main course) was a bit disappointed. Will recommend their tasting menu instead.
4
cozy little restaurant near raffles. we had a 7 course tasting dinner menu. food was good. choice of wine could be better.overall service was great, staff were attentive. will definitely come back to this restaurant.
3
Had a very nice meal. Owner did the sell on the chefs choice. There was one other table of about 8 diners, so it was a quiet night. Quality of the food was good but nothing mind blowing.
4
Very friendly and helpful wait staff (plus maitre d' / owner). Able to advise (checked with kitchen) and then provided delicious, fresh, salt free meal!
5
third times that i go to sela for lunch. Always the same, entree main dessert for 17sgd. Food is pretty good for that price. Try the chicken corn soup.
3
Had a 3-course lunch set in the restaurant. The portions served for each of the course were pathetic and not enough to fill the stomach. Was particularly shocked to see the size of the cake served at the end of the meal. That was really the smallest piece of cake I had ever seen being served in a plate setting. Taste wise, the mushroom soup starter was the best out of the 3 dishes. Staff was attentive and warm though :
5
My wife and I had dinner at Sela recently and had a fantastic experience! I had the 7-course tasting menu and my wife had Chilean sea bass along with a salad. The sea bass was moist and cooked perfectly. The 7-course menu was terrific particularly the pork cheeks and the potato leek soup. At $50 including wine it was more than a reasonable deal, Service was first-class. Restaurant competition is tough in Singapore but this is still a standout
4
Had dinner with friends, once entered, we were greeted by their friendly staff and were promptly seated. The person serving us were able to provide adequate explanation regarding the menu. We ordered a steak and three other fish dish. All were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Flavours were spot on . Delicious food which I will be back for more .
4
I was there for dinner on 11 Sep 15. They have a 5-course and 7-course tasting menu at $40 and $50 respectively which includes a glass of house wine and the servings are not small. For 2 ladies, we can actually share 1 set with an additional main. We had the grilled portobello, miso chilean seabass and grain-fed striploin and they were all very good. The vanilla custard tau huay is interesting although I was a bit hesitant to order at the beginning. Service was really good too. Since we ordered only 2 sets, only 2 pax in our group had the wine but the waiter (guess he must be the owner) offered to give us another complimentary glass of wine. But since I don' take alcohol, he offered me tea or coffee instead. At the end of the meal, the restaurant even prepared a slice of cake for us as it was our wedding anniversary. What a surprise! I would definitely recommend this place for its value for money yummy food and good service

Recommended by friends who went there for dinner, I reserved a lunch for 4 hoping to see if the recommendation was correct. Without any special expectation, we came for a quick lunch. To my surprise, the restaurant was empty. We had the whole place almost to ourselves. The set lunch sounded interesting and economical enough for us and so we tried. Friends commented with the ambience so quiet and price so cheap, we should not expect too much. Surprise after surprise, the Tom Yum mussel pasta and the "chicken rice" were so good. They have unique tastes that could tickle our taste buds. All commented they were uniquely new in taste for a pasta or chicken for rice. The set came with salad or soup, and a dessert. All were surprisingly good. And they even served an extra dessert for our birthday girl too. The set lunch is worth it. I now must try their dinner one of these days
5
The food is good and nicely plated. The staff there are extremely friendly and pay attention to detail of the customers' needs. Highly recommended.

I like this restaurant which serves gd dishes. they are affordable and gd for all. I like the ambience of the restaurant a lot.

Visited the restaurant on 30 July 2015 after reading many nice review on this restaurant. Food serve was not timely. While having our soup halfway through, the main course arrived. Hence, main course were placed on the next table while we were still having the soup and Country Bread Basket.Tried Miso Chilean Seabass (signature dish) was salty. Confit of Chicken Leg "Chicken Rice Style" was not impressive. Desserts were Sake Poached Pear (quite nice) and Dehydrated Pineapple Pavlova (again not impressive). House wine were nice.Overall experience were not impressive at all. It could be quite noisy if restaurant is crowded. Too many hard walls. Will hesitate to recommend anyone there
4
We went on Thursday night promo which offer unlimited wine with tapas for $40+ per person. This is small restaurant but very cozy. The quality of food was very good from starter to mains - the meat dishes was wonderful melt in your mouth! They are so generous with portion that we had to skip dessert. They are also generous to top up your wine at every course they serve. Would definitely return again
5
affordable, The food is lovely, the wine is definitely nice, Especially I love that pork dish which I tasted them in my first visit in May 2015. I went there again last night and was amazed by the grilled prawns, The TAPAS -- $40 for 2 hour of a free flow of red/white wine and 7-8 rounds of food is definitely worth the money.I had now became Sela free promoter and had introduced them to 10 groups of my friends and business acquaintances. I will definitely go again and again and again .....

We decided to try this new-ish restaurant for a friend's birthday 2 weeks ago after it came highly recommended by a few different friends. 3 of us ladies shared a steak (i was trying to find the name of the dish on their website but realised they have already change to a summer menu !) The steak was very tasty and succulent. The gentleman who served us was so passionate, warm and friendly that we initially thought he must be the owner. But we found out later that he was an employee. The owner himself, Leonard, is very friendly and warm as well. He sat down with us and had a long engaging conversation. For dessert, we had chocolate parfait and prosecco fruit terrine. These were really good ! The birthday girl even received a complimentary customised cake. I have not had such an enjoyable experience at a local restaurant for a long time and I will definitely be back to dine again too

My colleagues and I were at City Hall area and were looking for a place to dinner.I recommended this restaurant, as I last came here a few months back and have good impressions of the food. We walked over to Seah Street, and the restaurant had a private event, with a corporate function. The manager said the outside table was available and we were ok with it, as we can also watch the world go by. The restaurant has new items on their menu and we ordered. Here are the highlights of our meal:Starters- Seabass Cerviche: $16.50: Raw sliced seabass tossed in honey grain mustard, much like Chinese ‘Yu Sheng’ and served with crab mousse on crouton, shallots, blackberries, and avocado cream. I loved the texture of the seabass ad it was tasty. The avocado cream and crab mousse were also good. Try eating them altogether. Recommended!- Seared Scallops: $17.50. This was served atop thinly-sliced dragonfruit slices (like carpaccio) and drizzled with Thai fish sauce dressing, then topped with haricot verts and walnuts. I like the presentation and the dragonfruit complemented the scallops well. Try it.- Duck Fat Baby Potatoes: $12. Halved baby potatoes cooked in duck fat with sliced sausages. The potatoes were nicely grilled and tasty. Easy to pick at with the fork while we waited for our main courses to arrive. Mains- Veal Tenderloin: $38. The tenderloin is wrapped in parma ham, grilled and we were served 2 thick slices, of medium doneness. The meat is pink, tender and yummy. Its served with Romaine leaves, Shimeiji mushrooms, halved potatoes and veal jus. Everything is good. If you love beef, you must try this!- Berkshire Pork Cheek: $22. The pork is nicely braised. This was served with baby carrots, raspberries, baked peaches, mashed potatoes with pork jus. Great presentation. After everything is finished on the plate, I even used my fork to scoop every last morsel of the sauce. Good!- Chilean Seabass: $34. Nicely marinated and grilled. Its served with miso soy, edaname, strawberries in Vietnamese rice paper and topped with salmon roe. What I love about this dish is the rice rolls which was a nice surprise. Loved the taste of the whole dish. Must order!Desserts- Chocolate Parfait: $10. Served in a hour glass shaped glassware, the dessert is tasty and yummy. I had to keep at eating, cos my colleagues were also going at it. Too slow, and it will be all gone!- Prosecco Fruit Terrine: $14. Interesting dessert, where fruits were set in a prosecco infused jelly, with chocolate shavings, raspberry sorbet and whipped cream. The jelly has a hint of prosecco, and the raspberry sorbet was tangy and nice. I must say amongst all the items we had, the main courses were the stand-outs for my meal.To go with the food, we ordered some sake, which paired very well with the food. The sake were served in tall wine glasses which I swirled to sniff the aroma of the sake. This definitely elevated my dining experience. Overall, the food quality is good, especially for the main courses. Price-wise, its good value, ‘cos you will definitely pay more at other restaurants for the quality of their food. A good outing, and we had a great time. Recommended

We had a company team lunch at Restaurant Sela, and it was generally a positive experience.I really like how the restaurant was decked out - modern, uncluttered, classy - and that big table in the middle of the dining room as a point from where service can be conducted is both a beautiful piece of furniture and a great idea! The atmosphere was good. Not many diners (probably turned off by the menu prices, because not set lunch menu per many restaurants in Sg).Food wise, very good. We shared some entrees - duck fat potatoes (very nice, decandent), marinated anchovy fillets (lovely!). For mains, I had herb crusted lamb rack, which was brilliantly cooked with very well matched condiments on the plate. As part of their current deal for lunches, one gets complimentary coffee/tea with a scoop of ice-cream. My triple-choc ice cream was very yummy, and coffee was well made.The only problem we had with this place: service was slow. There was only 1 other couple apart from our table of 10. Our mains took too long to come, and after that, the serving of coffee & ice creams was tardy. We could perhaps forgive them, because we are a big group, and they correctly wanted to serve all diners together. It also seems they only have a small espresso machine, so takes time to make 7 coffees. The food was worth the wait though... :) A word about the staff - they could be more responsive. My colleagues like interacting, joking with service staff every time we have team lunches, and most restaurant staff would respond. The staff at Sela were probably too composed... LOL!Overall, a very pleasant dining experience.Highly recommended for business lunch (but not a big group).I think a lovely romantic dinner here would be good too

Came here today with a small group to celebrate a friend's birthday. We all opted for the prosecco brunch which consists of 3 courses and free-flow prosecco. I had the scallops for starter, the pork belly for main course, and the vanilla gelato for dessert. All the food was very decent and service was friendly and efficient. Value was excellent at just $48++ each. Well worth a visit
5
Proseccobrunch at 48 is a steal!!! Free flow of prosecco plus 3 course meal!! Shockingly good deal. We start the meal with the very crispy bread. The start asparagus is very yummy. I ordered the steak with sunny side up and the steak is really good. I asked for a change in dessert and their ice cream is shockingly good.. Sour sweet all in one!

My husband and I had a lovely dinner at Restaurant Sela on a Friday night. I was in the mood to try a new place, but am always reluctant in Singapore since it's difficult to find a spot where the price, ambiance, food, drinks, service all positively align. Sela certainly hit all these points with high marks. We particularly liked our starters - foie gras, and asparagus with poached eggs. The only thing I'd suggest to management is to make the lighting more of a soft yellow than the white lighting (but seems to be favored in Asia). We'll definitely return
4
We occasionally go out on a Sat evening for dinner to explore and try new eating places. Found out about SELA on the internet and decided to try it out. Did a reservation via email at 3pm and by 4pm Sat afternoon, we received a confirmation for our group of 5 for a 7pm seating. The place is easy to find, just next to Raffles Hotel on Seah Street.We tried gilled Tiger Prawns, Squids, Mussels and Asparagus for starts. Also ordered bread that comes with butter and olive oil dip. For mains, we tried the lamp chops, sea bass. For desserts we tried ice cream, gula melaka creme brulee, lemon cheese tart.The owner (Mr Chan) was very friendly and came round to talk to us and other guest. He was warm and friendly. When he realised that the place where we were seated was not as cold, he immediately when to turn on the air curtain blowers to improve the circulation of the cold air from the AC. Mr Chan also took time to explain to us the source of the mussels were ate (from Scotland) and the type of seabass (which actually tasted and feels like cod).Thru out the evening, the conversations with Mr Chan over our meal time made us feel like we are friends.Our 3 kids loved the food and ambience and their interaction with Mr Chan as well. We'll be back again and introduce our friends to this good find and nice makan.

Went there with 2 other friends and it was our first time there. Only 5 months old, the menu changes monthly and although not super long, it had enough choices to satisfy discerning palates. Paired with the excellent food, a list of wines from all over, with sake and craft brews from Japan is available.We were there during a quieter time and service was very attentive with the owner Leonard coming over to talk to us about his restaurant and menu recommendations.We had a great time there and will be back for more
5
The first time i was there, must say i was wow by the food. Their seabass is extremely good and their steak is good yet doesnt burn yr pocket. Best meal i had there is the prosecco brunch as is totally worth the money. S$48 for free flow of prosecco + a set course which consist of starter, main and dessert. Will go there agai

This is a restaurant located at Purvis Street, and have been receiving rave reviews in the media. The restaurant offers modern European cuisine and has a tight 2 page menu, with 5 – 6 items for their starter, meats, seafood, mains and desserts section. This is good, compared to many restaurants who do multiple pages for their menu and leaving diners to ask the restaurant staff what are their specialities. This means the restaurant is confident of their offerings and keeping the menu items tight for each selection I paid a visit with my lunch partner for lunch this week to try their food. Here are the meal highlights:Ciabatta Roll: $3. This was baked in-house and it was very soft and fragrant. A order is a set of 3 rolls comes with butter cubes and olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip. Just eating it alone or with the butter was heavenly. I had two pieces before the meal started. Soup: Green Peas, Asparagus, Prawns and Edamame: $14. The soup is nice and smooth. I loved the edamame beans in the soup. The prawns and asparagus were grilled and placed on the side of the soup. Loved this. Starter: - Grilled Asparagus, Poached Egg, Parma Ham, Mixed Berries Compote: $19.50. The restaurant included some elements of Xmas in their menu and the mixed berries is that addition. The egg was runny when we cut into it. Mixed the yolk into the dish and it added a nice flavour and texture to the dish. The compote made the dish more purple.- Duck Rillete, Seared Candied Foie Gras, Balsamic Cream topped with Rocket Leaves: $19.50. I loved foie gras and the duck rillete was a good pairing to make this this ‘all things duck’. The rillettes were nice and creamy. Foie gras was decent sized. Must-order!Meats: Herb Crusted Lamb Rack, Grilled Tomatoes on Vine and Baby Carrots with Cranberry Compote and Chocolate Glaza: $32 The lamb was roasted to medium rare. The herbs crust imparted a nice flavour to the lamb. Delicious and the vegetables were also good. Order it if you love lamb and no regrets!Seafood: Baked Miso Chilean Seabass. Edamame, Sweet Peas topped with Salmon Roe: $28. Nice big portion of fish that has been baked so the skin is nice and crispy on the edges. The sauce reminds me of oriental sauce, though the restaurant manager assures me that there’s miso in it. Its topped with a nice helping of salmon roe that makes this dish absolutely delicious. I think most ladies will like this dish, cos it’s light and easy on the tummy. Must-try!Sharing: - Salmon Skewers with Grape Relish: $13. Instead of serving on a plate, the restaurant serves this on a Himalayan Salt block. The salt imparts a nice salty flavour to the salmon that is placed on top, removing the need to sprinkle salt on the dish as a finishing, like most restaurants. Interesting indeed. Try it!- Beef Tongue with Red Cabbage Salsa: $18. It may sound off-ish, but I loved it. The tongue is sliced thinly and nicely grilled. It has a nice smokey flavour and eaten with the purple cabbage and mango salsa, it was yummy!Dessert: - Gula Melaka Crème Caramel: $12. Gula Melaka is used in this dish making it a unique dessert with a local ‘twist’. It came together really well and I loved it. Recommended! - Wasabi Ice Cream: $10.50: An interesting a rare ice-cream option. The ice cream was mildly spicy and the restaurant plated this with oreo crumbs and some cut strawberries and blue berries, topped with a piece of chocolate. I usually like eating my ice cream plain. But the oreo crumbs went very well with the ice cream. Must-order!I chanced upon their offering of Japanese Craft Beers in their drinks menu, and ordered the following:- Swanlake Porter, from Niigata: $22. Niigata is famous for their rice production, and this beer is made from rice. This was poured in a wine goblet, and the manager swirled the bottle before pouring it in the glass. You swirl the goblet to get a whiff of the aroma before sipping the beer, much like appreciating the first taste of wine. It had a nice fresh flavour and a good taste. Loved it!- Swanlake Koshihikari Rice Lager, from Niigata: $22. This was also unique. This is a dark beer, almost like a stout and it has a nice coffee flavour. If you love coffee and beer like I do, it’s the best of both worlds!There are other interesting items on the menu that I would like to try, such as Hokkkaido Scallops with Blueberry Cerviche, Slow Braised Kurobuta Pork Cheek, Grilled Octopus with potatoes, spinach, oranges and strawberries and Dessert: Rice Beer Sabayon with Mixed berries and Vanilla Ice cream, and Caramel Balsamico Ice cream. The menu changes every month, with some favourites retained in the new menu. I look forward to coming to this restaurant again. Recommended

The cosy ambience of SELA blew me away when I was there. It was located along the small road in the heart of Seah Street. They served Modern European dishes and I am particularly awed by the way they serve them. The dishes were on sea-salt plates and the best part of it all, the sea salt enhances the taste of the scallop and salmon dishes. It was delicious! I also had the Grilled NZ Black Angus Ribeye Steak, medium well. It was well grilled and suitable for the health nut as you would be pleased to know that it is not oily. Chef Shahlom also came out to greet us while we were dining there. It was a rather pleasurable experience
4
I went to Restaurant SELA , not once but twice. Yeah, me and my bf like the place very much & we simply love the environment & food there. My bf & I are meat lovers , Herb Crusted Lamb is our favourite dish :)One unique thing about SELA is , they are one of the few restaurants in Singapore which serves Japanese craft beers.If you ask me, Swanlake porter is my choice. My bf loves Swanlake Koshihikari Rice Lager.And don't forget their signature dessert -- Gula Melaka Creme Caramel!!!In short, Yummy food, reasonable price, excellent service. Will definitely come back again! :))

restaurant SELA - an almost 5 month old restaurant at the heart of the city, serving up a range of afforable contemporary modern cuisines whilst pairing them with wine and award winning japanese beers. The tapas and beers were outstanding which works well with the after offce hours crowd. Mains and desserts were alittle meh. Read my full review @ http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/11/restaurant-sela-where-west-meets-east.htm

This is my second visit to Sela restaurant. I have tried different dishes on two separate occasions. Each time, I was awed by the delicious and savoury dishes.I love the appetizer - carpaccio scallop; soup - potato leek with asparagus and prawns; main courses - sea bass, lamb, mussels, crab lasagna;dessert - sorbet and wasabi ice-cream.The ambience is cosy and relaxing. I would definitely go there again
