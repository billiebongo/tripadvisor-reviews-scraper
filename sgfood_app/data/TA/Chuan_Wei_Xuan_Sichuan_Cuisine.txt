There are many Sichuan restaurants in Singapore. This restaurant seems so unassuming, so small, so simple and plain. But just sit down and order and you're being transported. I recommend their Mapo Tofu, which is silky tofu cubes in a fragrant sauce. Order as well their signature dish, the Shui Zhu Yu, which is cooked fish that is really fragrant of chili and pepper corn. Since English is not the forte of the serving staff, you can easily think you're in Sichuan. The food already seems never to have left Sichuan
