Been here at least 3 time. Granted, it is a bit tough to get too and require the use of private transport, but the family oriented and welcoming nature of the owners make it worthwhile. Try the Tandoori Platter and Cheese Naan

We are at Sher on our way to the Singapore night safari. A very warm welcome, excellent reasonably priced food and a calming atmosphere. A much better choice than the frenetic food court at the venue. Thoroughly recommended!

We visited the place after Singapore Zoo and also on the review.What stands out, we got a warm welcome and felt very much like we have been visiting them quite often. The seating and Decor was nice. Minimalistic design well suited for Family with Kids. They keep engaging you in Nice conversation. The Food Taste good and its Moderately priced.I would love visit them again. The guys offered us Kadi though we dis not order and it was super yummy.Good Job GuysBest Regards and Best Of Luck.Suni

I decided to try this out after reading all the great reviews. I love food and especially north indian so I went in there with hopes. firstly the food is good, but I wont term it great. No not at all. Well we ordered vegetarian and it was nice taste but then you tend to get that in all good indian restaurants. It did not blow me away. The service is good, but then there is hardly many guests, that too on a sunday eve, so that tells you.The downers for me :1) Ambiance : There really is nothing. ITs a std sit in. I had the wrong expectation.2) Drinks - Heard so much about their cocktails. Ordered a few, and unfortunately the attendant said, only the owners know how to fix drinks. Well if they are not around then there goes your eve.3) Food portion - The prices look good because portions are relatively small. Other place might charge 20% extra but then qty is more,overall place is way out . Taking a dedicated taxi to reach there for the avg exp not worth it.This is probably a place where people with their own cars just want to go to a decent place to have overall nice food. Yeah do it.will I go there again, not anytime soon. nothing much against the place, but there is no compelling reason

It is a nice cozy place for dinner. Purely north indian cuisine, restaurant itself is not very comfortable as it is quite cramped. Taste was good and order was received in quick time. Staffs were friendly and have their own parking space. God to this restaurant and enjoy authentic north indian food.

First proper northern Indian food since I arrived in December 2016. Fish curry and dhal did not disappoint. As it was delivered, the naan texture is expected to go off key. Am going to eat at the physical restaurant tomorrow. I have found my next favorite restaurant!

This place has a great selection of dishes and everything is delicious. My favorite is the chef's special fish dish, but they also make a fabulous channa masala and dahl malkni. Also, they offer different rice dishes and various nan flavors. Be sure to treat yourself to a mango lassi. The owners are also very friendly and and make everyone feel welcome. Happy eating

I am yet to visit the restaurant but thrice we have ordered food for delivery. The taste of food is good, particularly the mushroom starter. Overall a good option if you reside in Sembawang area.It is reasonably price. We often go for movie and order food after the movie is over. By the time we reach home, the food also reaches. It is fresh and hot

The food is genuinely good, the place is quite and you can have a nice conversation.
The owner are available to explain you the food, to suggest and take order. I had a nice evening in that place.

Tasty food served in a lovely ambience reminiscent of eating a hearty meal at a favourite relative's home

Beware - if you are pure vegetarian. We were told by the cook that he adds egg while preparing Naan.

The location of this restaurant was very close to our hotel - Holiday inn Atrium and it is also next to the river at Robertson Quay. Enjoyed the food!

Some of the very best Indian food I've ever had in SG, period. The owner and staff was extremely friendly and they had a good beer selection including some nice microbrews. This place is gonna be one of my regular spots from now on.

I really enjoyed this place. Friendly staff, nice decor and the food was super delicious. Fish curry, sag paneer, butter chicken, dal and of course naan. All served by 3 of the friendliest people who helped us decide on what to order. Try the lime juice -- sooooo good

I am not a big fan of North Indian cuisine ( I am Indian though). But this one impressed me. The food was pretty good, and most importantly, there were a good selection of beers. Suggest to try the Tandoori Platter. The service was also goo

Friendliness of the owners was immediate. Don't know how often they are here as their business cards lists three outlets. Unpretentious place with subtle ethnic feel from colourful lampshades a couple of pictures and an orange wall. Lime juice was excellent.Fish starter was great. Food came up fast. Chicken - good choice of biriani, tandoori, mughlai and moor. Nice bread - not sure if they have an oven or if it's fried, but it was fast and good. We forgot to order a vegetable and weren't reminded by the waiters (who spoke less English - but calling over the owners solved all problems). Two desserts were gulab jamun and kulfi. Food was filling and fast and at about $20 a head a bargain in what is supposed to be one of the world's most expensive cities. You can sit outside at the front, or inside (it's open at both ends). Will be go back? Yes

Sher is probably the only restaurant in the north Singapore that serves authentic and delicious north Indian food. Located in a peaceful area on Sembawang Road with a few minutes drive / bus ride from Khatib MRT station.The food was delicious although it could have been slightly more spicy to suit the Indian tongue. We did not find it cheap but an excellent value for money.The owners and the other staff did the best to make us comfortable.We will return here more frequently. Highly recommended
