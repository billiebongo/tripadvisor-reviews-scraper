Called in one morning for a cold drink and fully enjoyed an iced Mocha and iced Chocolate and at 6$ each exceptional value. Would fully recommend.

Great sandwiches. Good coffee and a relaxed place. The price was reasonable considering we were in the heart of Singapore but its very convenient to be able to walk in a seat yourself and grab some quick food

I popped in to Swiss Bake for a lunch bite. Good service, the sandwiches were excellent and all reasonably priced. Recommended.
