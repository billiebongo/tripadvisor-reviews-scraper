Other Than the kaya Toast I'm a fan of their Big bao! Huge but very full ! Satisfying but do Becareful of the Hot juice from the Bao it will get ur hands oily.. do drop by here for some cheap and good breakfast!

Had lunch here and ordered the Mee Siam and a cup of honey lemon. The Mee Siam tasted good. This outlet is also pretty quiet given that there's less traffic here...

This outlet looks different from the rest- it has a modern interior. The usual local favourites are available. Mee Soto, Laksa, Mee Rebus etc. it is at a hidden corner and it not very crowded at the moment.

This local franchise restaurant offers another wonderful, tasty kaya bread and bun set with delicious milk tea. Its superb kaya bun is my favorite, better than the crispy bread that is more popular. The place also offers other local food like laksa, mee siam, and other local dishes. Decoration is further making your experience fulfilled with impression for local Singapore experience. Trust me.
