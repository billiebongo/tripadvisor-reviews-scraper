Excellent Food, Great Company, Convenient Place. What more do I need. Coffee Rib was excellent and other dishes were just as good. Pricing was friendly.

Yummy yummy, my 6 years old finished 1 crab, my 3 years old finished half plate of "yue guang he", while i likes the soup and fish head, and he likes everything. Come, and try it yourself.
5
Awesome food! Get the duck egg fried crab - your life will never be the same. Black pepper crab was also excellent. Great place. Highly recommended
5
Very delicious & good portion size. Good "wok-hei" If you like pig liver, have to order the claypot pig liver, super yummy!! Friendly & helpful service team.

Good quality zi char. Favorite is claypot pork liver. Come early if you did not reserve a table else need to wait for a table
The stuffed toufu is very good too

Visits Keng Eng Kee number of time, food is nice , price is reasonable .
Is always good to call for reservations
Few open car park around that area, good place for Dinner
They do have a aircon room with just few table

First time back here in almost five years. Loved it. The service is excellent and fast, the food is just outstanding. This is NOT a luxury restaurant, but it is where you'll find great local cuisine served the way the locals like it. You're outdoors, but covered, the beer is appropriately priced, and the plastic chairs are comfortable

I have had chilli crab in Singapore before - a must-do for any foodie, This great place was recommended by a local and was well used by locals. outdoor (under cover) with plastic plates. efficient and not especially friendly service, but we were speaking English and not all of the wait staff did. Tasty crab and jasmine tea was excellent. Crab is expensive, but there were many other cheaper dishes on offer. There was even a wash basin to clean up in when the chilli got too far up my arms

Dinner with 3 friends, ordered their so called signature Crab Mee Hoon, and other signature dishes. Having just ate at De Classic Golden Spoon, at Seng Poh Lane previous night, with the best in the world Crab Mee Hoon, we ordered the same here, along with some signature stirfried Vege, signature fish slices with bitter gourd and claypot Pork Belly Salted Fish. Guess after a fantastic dinner at the previous night's dinner place, our expectations were a bit high. The meal was mediocre at best. Price for 4 with 4 dishes (incl Crab) was S$115, incredibly low value. The Crab was large and fresh, but a total waste of its quality over the tasteless style of cooking, the stirfried Vege wasn't even mediocre, followed by at best average bitter gourd fish slices in black bean. The only decent dish was the Claypot Pork Belly Salted Fish, which is incredibly easy to get right, I mean, everywhere offers a good such a dish.I wouldn't return, and definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend

Delicious zhichar at reasonable prices. Don't let the picture of empty tables fool you - I dined early to avoid the crowd. If you notice closely, the empty tables are all actually reserved, as can be seen by the orders scribbled down on a price of paper that is attached to the plastic standee on each table!So yes, you can call in advance to reserve a table, but be prepared to also place your order then to secure your reservation. ☺ We had: Coffee Pork Ribs 咖啡排骨 - 小 ($12); great honey & coffee flavour, no bones to drive me crazy. Insanely fragrant too. Prawn Roll 虾枣 - 小 ($8); though fried, oil doesn't ooze from its side, which I really like. Comes with dipping sauce in a little plastic dish. Lotus Vegetables 菜脯小炒王 - 小 ($12); crunchy bits left crunchy, juicy bits were juicy. Good choice!Double Boiled Soup 时日村汤 - 大 ($12)Slightly creamy, comfortingly decadent. Check with them what soups are available as it changes often. Bai Ling Gu & Chinese Mushrooms with Spinach 白灵菇冬菇菠菜 - 小 ($15); this was alright, didn't find it very special but also I'm not the biggest fan of spinach, so... Individual bowls of rice are 60¢ each. Wet towels are chargeable by default at 20¢ each; if you don't want that, just return them when you call for the bill. Air-conditioned seats available☀ Al fresco seats available Accepts reservations - call the

Black pepper crab here is generally better than chili crab. I consider it a cheaper alternative to Jumbo, but if you're a foreigner, you might have difficulty finding your way here as it is only accessible via bus if you're counting on public transportation.
4
One of my favorable staple food go to restaurant. They have the best moonlight hor fun in town which came with lots of "worhay". The clayport liver was rich in flavor which helped me finished 2 bowls of rice. The menu was extensive which comprise almost every favorite Singapore zi char dish. Located in a coffee shop and has a small air-con area. The restaurant is run by the entire family member. Looks like that help to maintain the high food and service quality for last many years
5
Group of 9 of us enjoyed a great deal tonight. The dishes served were piping hot, delicious, cook perfectly. The old style shark fin, fried salted egg yolk squid rings, brinjal, etc... worth trying. Happy family time enhanced with good food. Thank you all the staff at Keng Eng Kee. Well done.
3
Any web search for a zi char (local restaurant normally serving chinese dishes) and Keng Eng will pop up. Today wasn't my first time here. Had the midnight hor fun (which is black sauced hor fun noodles with a raw egg on top - can be substitute with a fired egg if you are particular), sotong you tiao (dough fritter stuffed with squid paste) , coffee pork ribs and salted egg squid. All very average. You not going to love it but you are not going to hate it either. As previous reviews , the prices are reasonable.
4
We tried their popular dishes, salted egg crab, 3-egg spinach, ming zhu rolls & fried moon light hor fun. Indeed the taste was nice for all dishes especially the salted egg crab. We all liked their sauce. In total we consumed less than $100, so considered quitereasonable. We would come back again
4
Chilly crab is not that fantastic compare to Melben. But the steam crab with salted egg yolk sauce is a must. Laden with cholesterol, this dish is too yummy to resist. They serve steam bun instead of normal fried bun to go with the crab sauces.Price for the crab at S$68/kg (seasonal price)is comparable to those popular restaurant that serves the same dishes
4
we wanted to eat Chilli Crab and the reception at the hotel recommended here, just 2 blocks walking distance from the hotel.the food is really good, and relatively affordable compared to places like Jumbo RestaurantChilli Crab was SGD65 for 1kg and the cereal squid is awesome
4
Been a fan of KEK since I was there few years ago. I love their salted egg crabs (fried) goes perfectly with Mantou; claypot drunken prawns (really fresh and the soup is awesome); MingZhu roll (their signature dish which is fried beancurd stuffed with prawns, ham & mushrooms) and prawn roll (Hei Zor). Always call in advance to make reservations especially if you wish to dine in aircon comfort as they've very limited space indoors
4
I like the way the aunty service staff took care of our table. She suggested many good taste dishes with not so different from 'no sign board' but the price are at it half. Most of the dishes are better than expected. I like to come back again

Buzzing and chaotic, super popular seafood place close-by Alexandra Food Village. It's pretty hard to get the waiters attention but when you manage to order and don't mind to wait a little for your food the results are pretty good. Crab-wise I geehrter would've wished for the chili crab to be more spicy as this one was mainly sweet and strong on the tomato. The pepper crab however was interesting and different to the ones I had before. If I'm not wrong I spotted a few curry leaves and tasted some planchan in here. My favorite dishes though were the tofu with minced meat and definitely the salted egg prawns, outstanding shrimpies!!
4
This stall has evolved from a corner of a coffee shop to a huge establishment.
The food is typical tze char style and offer pretty good selection different seafood. Their claypot liver is amazingly good after all these years.
Competitive pricing.
2
Cny set menu food not as good as normal. Feels like they were rushing out their orders to meet the festive crowd, quality of food was compromised. Had better meals with them during the non festive period.
5
Placed was packed on Sunday. Food was yummy. Love the Abalone Loh Hei, salty egg yolk crab and the sweet sour pork. Reasonable price. Will visit again
5
Have been to this restaurant many times and it is still one of my favorite restaurants for crabs and tze char. Prices are reasonable, food served are tasty, staffs are bisybyet courteous, environment noisy yet accomodating. Definitely is a place worth tontry ifnyou have not yet tried. Remember to call and reserve for the crabs if you may be disappointed to hear "crabs sold out, no more crabs!" . Just like my most recent trip there.
4
This is like the normal neighbourhood type of eating houses that you find all across Singapore. They seem to specialist in seafood but I find the other non-fish dishes were very good too.We had black pepper crab, chilli crab, coffee pork ribs, fried Kai lan and a tofu dish. The coffee port ribs were outstanding, tender and juicey and the sauce was to die for. The veggie was cooked to perfection and the tofu was good too. The black pepper crab was good too, it left a hot peppery taste in the mouth. The chilli crab was so-so and we had steamed buns to soak up the gravy. I had the salted egg crab during my first visit and I think it was much better than the chilli crab. We were charged $65 for each of the crab dish which was supposed to weigh one kilo each. I doubt very much the weight was correct!There was no ambience to speak off, it was an open coffee shop type of place which tended to get very noisey and humid.Make a booking before you arrive
4
If there is one dish that you wish to try here, I recommend the Salted Eggs Crabs. Rich in flavour and with copious amounts of salted eggs, these crabs were very well done.I also tried the following, which were good as well:1. Coffee Pork Ribs2. Fried Mee Sua3. Dry yee mian (noodles)Chilli crabs were so-s
4
Come earlier or make reservations before you come! Everything was delicious but crab wasn't that fresh.. only for tonight haha the other days I come the crab were fresh.. their salted egg sauce is thick and awesome! Marmite porkrib was tender too love it much! We order the CNY set mail I think total we paid for 507$ for 9 pax lol.. love the fish maw soup too ..
5
Simply love this Zi Char place! Had visited this place with my husband's family for umpteen times. Our favourite dishes are Claypot liver, Cuttlefish with Sambal Kang Kong, Coffee Pork ribs, Ming Zhu Juan and Marmite chicken. Simply awesome!!!! Their serving speed is quite fast too. A note to first timer: Usually they are fully occupied, especially during weekend dinner and festive season. Do make your reservation early!!!

Every time I visit Singapore, I drop by this restaurant to succumb to my craving for Salted egg crab. Their version is a little sweet, fyi.There are two options for salted egg crab - fried and steamed. The difference (for me) is that the steamed one has more sauce and it's meat doesn't stick to the shell. The fried one has less sauce but has crispy (very thin) breading that tastes great as well.We usually order Salted Crab paired with buns. I did order rice when I first ate at Keng Eng Kee, but after tasting their buns and dipping them to the salted egg sauce... I forgot about the rice.Tried their cereal prawn as well but didn't enjoy it much. Highly recommended for salted egg crabs and don't forget to order an extra bowl of sauce for 4sgd! Very affordable for 60 sgd per order. Enjoy
5
Two thumbs up for this place. This is my first time to this place even though I live quite close. The place was already crowded when I reached, but fortunately my friend had already made a reservation. Would advise that you make a reservation too if you are going there with a group. Ordered the Sotong with salted egg, coffee pork ribs, fish slices with bitter gourd, xiao bak cai and their signature dishes ngoh hiang, tau pok and moonlight hor fun. The dishes are generally good and service is very quick. The bill come up to only slightly over $100 for 6 of us including 2 rounds of non-alcoholic drinks. Definitely value for money! My friend who is a regular there said that for some unknown reasons, they charged more for drinks if you are seated in the aircon area. So she reserved a table for us in the non aircon area. Only problem with this place is the parking, which gets packed rather quickly as there is also another popular Zi char place nearby.

Invited an oversea friends to try their crab. Their chilli crab were nice and fresh. We fell in love with their man tou. It is nice and soft. Overall their prices were reasonable.
5
Have a craving for seafood and we again went to Kay Eng Kee for dinner. The place was crowded for a Monday night and there was a reason for it to be so. The quality of their food remains consistently very good and we were never disappointed in all our outings at the restaurant. Ambience is a little lacking as it operates out of a food centre but the food and friendly service certainly made up for it. There were even quite a number of foreign tourists that have managed to uncover this place even though it is out of the tourist belt. It is certainly a place to eat if you love seafood and at very reasonable prices. One of my favourite sea food restaurant
5
One of our friends living here in Singapore recommended this resto for lunch. Wow! Great price, authentic taste and a favourite among the locals. The staff are friendly and the service is fast! We had the Cereal Prawns, Chili Crabs, Coffee Pork Ribs among the other dishes. All the ingredients are fresh and cooked right. We will definitely be back to eat again
5
Perennial local favourite, one of the best zichar stores in Singapore, with great price and well executed food. Perfectly pocket friendly price esp if you skip the seafood. The must order for me is : Mingzhu roll, coffee ribs, Moonlight Horfun. Despite other great reviews I would skip the cuttlefish kangkong. Homemade Tofu is excellent except a tad expensive at $12. Yam ring is executed well. Having a aircon space with the same price is a huge plus for tourists. I highly recommend this place for a taste of the authentic Singaporean cooking at local prices
5
We came here at 6 pm on a busy Sunday, without reservations, but they found a table for us. It's a huge eatery with many outdoor, non air con tables, and a small air con area with just a few tables. We sat outdoors, and our food arrived within 10-15 minutes after ordering. The older waiter who served us was extremely polite. We had prawn paste chicken, claypot Pork with salted fish (a tad too salty), signature mixed vegetables with dried radish, and cuttlefish kang kong. All were delicious and the quantity was generous despite being the "small" portions. With drinks, the cost was only $56 for 3 persons. It took no more than 45 minutes for our entire meal, so if you're looking for a quick early dinner this place would be ideal.
3
Returned to this place after many years. Food is not bad. Sad thing is there's no fried "man tou" aka bun to dip in the chilli crab sauce. Service was very very slow and service staff were blur. Sat at the aircon section and there was only 1 lady to serve 5 tables. She took a long while before coming over to take our order. When we wanted to order drinks, she informed she'll come back later.. which was 15mins later!! Our dishes were mixed up with the next table though we ordered much earlier. Twice they served us dishes we didn't order. We were there for birthday celebration and they totally missed out on our fried mee sua(rice noodle). Crabs were slightly overpriced. The chilli crab is over rated but their salted egg crab was quite good. Will strongly recommend their coffee pork ribs which is the best I've eaten so far.
3
We stayed close by in the Park Hotel and the tripadvisor recommended this with the highest rating in the neighbourhood. Although we had travel warning amber signal 'hoisted' in Hong Kong, we were brave enough to try outdoor fresco dining at Keng Eng Kee. The air was fresh in the night and we enjoyed a lot. The food was a bit average especially the chilly crab which was almost the national dish in Singapore. Perhaps the cheap price limited the size of the crab available as well as the place where the crab came from. We should order something else from the menu.
5
We decided to test out its non-seafood fare. They did not disappoint. The poached spinach in triple yolk had a fresh interpretation. Instead of superior stock, the yolks were done a large stir fried. However, the spinach continued to release its juices, leading to a clever transformation of the dish. The deer and tofu dishes were also excellent.
5
Ok so this place has virtually no tourists. English is not well spoken, but the crab is absolutely amazing. It's a little sweet rather than spicy so for those who can't handle the spice of most Singaporean dishes this is perfect. Other dishes highly recommended is the vegetable with dried squid, drunken prawns, tofu with mince pork and the fish head soup.
3
It was a letdown. Good flavour (on the salty side for Singaporeans) but crabs had soft meat. Not ideal when you are seeking for a good crab dish. Marmite chicken was alright. The fried vegetable nai bai was ok but din tai dung does it better.
5
We ate there last night with our Singaporean friends. It is mainly locals, very few tourists, actually none last evening. The food was great, cooked at the moment you order it, nothing pre-cooked. Simple but good local food.
5
This place need a prior reservation, else it's always crowded , especially during weekend . The seafood is very good, love both the chilli and peppe crab and price reasonable too.
4
Best of the Singapore Chilli Crab is here. Order the coffee pork as well. The cereal prawns are also great and fresh!
Best to come early else it will be hard to find seating. Parking is not a problem.
4
Serves very good chilli crabs, yam basket, drunken prawns and roasted chicken. Very pleasant and efficient service. I also like the fact that there is an aircon seating area - if you make a table reservation in advance!

KEK is a pretty local place and it's generally reasonable prices means it has lots of fans. If you want to experience what it's like to dine at a no frills Chinese restaurant located in one of the older public housing areas in Singapore, this is one place to try.The English menu with pictures is helpful for those new to Singapore style Chinese food. We would say that the food is competently prepared but not the best in class. On this visit, we ordered the chilli crab, deep fried yam ring with seafood (a classic old school dish) and kailan stir fried with garlic. The KEK version of chilli crab tasted like it uses a generous amount of shrimp paste for the sauce. We prefer the local versions of this dish without this particular ingredient. Our other two dishes tasted fine. A word on the service. Yes this can sometimes be gruff and grumpy but if you ask me, this is what it's often like to eat at a successful old school Chinese restaurant where the food is meant to speak for itself. It's part of the authentic experience.
5
Pak William Wongso was in Singapore, busy cooking at the Indonesian Embassy. I did not met Pak William, but he did bring my son and daughter in law, to KEK or Keng Eng Kee seafood restaurant. With his recommendation, my niece Reina, manage to get a reservation for lunch at KEK to celebrate the birth of our grand daughter. The food are really excellent. Pak William recommendation never fail.We have not had the chance to try the chilly Crab. it is a specialty of KEK. So we must come again soon
4
Had sunday lunch with family and loved the place.They have an aircon section as well as a normal non aircon section...sat in the non-aircon one since aircon section required a pre-reservation.While the place looks simple but, it has very good food.The chilli and black pepper crab and prawn roll are a must try....apart from that also liked the black pepper beef...there are lots of options in fish as well.Will definitely come back again her
5
A really messy affair with the chilli crab but worth all the hassle! Just the right amount of fire and perfumed with a heady mix of galangal, turmeric, fermented soy and aromatic spices. Also lovely was the tau pok stuffed with mushrooms, salted yolk and ham
5
This neighborhood restaurant seems cleaner and has better atmosphere than the average ones. More importantly, the seafood here tastes better than most other seafood restaurants. Not only its seafood, its non seafood dishes are also very good. In terms of quality and taste, in my opinion it beats some of the big-name restaurants like No Signboard, which says a lot. The prices of the food here are very reasonable
5
The crabs we had (chilli and salted) were fantastic although, of course,be prepared to get messy. They were big as well. I've had a lot of chilli crab in Singapore and this is one of he best.Typical of family restaurants I was assured this was good value and certainly cooked very well with very fast service
3
I personally like the salted egg calamari .. Tried it twice..
This round, we ordered the "kau ki" vegetable wolf berry soup.. Is really good.. I will highly recommend it..
The place is packed and suggest to make reservation.
4
This restaurant has a large open aired section and a small air-conditioned room that has about 8 large tables in it. This air-conditioned room is very popular and you would have to make reservations way in advanced. I pre-booked 2 weeks earlier and already could not get my preferred timeslot. Parking in this area is a nightmare too.I reserved two tables for 20 diners. Ordered largely their signature dishes : coffee pork ribs, marmite chicken, salted egg prawns, toufu, ming zhu platter, liver, spinach three eggs and sir fried mee sua. Worked out to be around S$380+, which is quite alright.All the dishes were tasty however, most of my guests liked the mee sua best. My australian guests liked the coffee ribs, prawns and marmite chicken. Children largely liked the marmite chicken.However, truth be told that the marmite chicken and coffee ribs were somewhat too sweet. My wife thought there was too much msg used too.As such, I would consider this place a place to go to once in a while but not an everyday go-to restaurant for families that do not cook and eats out everyday.The 'worst' part of this restaurant is the service personnel. The lady who took our order was always glaring at us whenever we ask for her attention. We felt like we were troubling her alot whenever we needed some service from her.Parking, unfriendly service and inconsistent food tastes are the key down points to this restaurant
4
Cereal fried rice came with chicken and strawberries! Surprising good. Claypot tofu had a delightful taste of ginger. Coffee spare ribs were really tasty, but had lots of fat and not much meat. The salted egg squid's batter was good, but the squid was too hard. Nice service staff who did their best with the busy crowd
4
The place at Pandan Garden although is small but it is ver Cosy. There are many dishes that are cook in different way that is nice and delicious and worth trying. Some of the dishes I like are Mermite chicken, dry fried hor fen, fried fish skin with salted egg and soft shelf crab.Average price: S$15-25/person for three dishes with rice and drink.They allow phone booking to
4
This restaurant has a lot of local diners and was filled with people when we went there. The food was delicious and tasty. We had stir-fried noodles, 4 season platter, roast chicken, beef and sweet and sour crab. The crab was fantastic, it was big and meaty
4
While Singapore life may not be getting any cheaper, its appetite for great value food has never been bigger. Nobody wants roti prata every night – regardless of how cheap it may be – hence a zi char eatery is a good cheap eat. No list of zi char outlets in Singapore could be complete without Keng Eng Kee Seafood Restaurant.Coffee Pork Ribs is the best thing in this place. Yes. You read that right. The signature dish in a seafood restaurant is pork ribs. This phenomenal dish is simply out of this world.The viscious coffee sauce gives the almost impossibly meaty ribs great depth of flavour and serious kick.If you are looking for good food at wallet-friendly prices, KEK is a useful place to plot-up. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
4
Visited the pandan gardens branch. Ordered 6 dishes and 2 drinks at a total cost of $64. Very affordable. Food was decently good. Didn't really get to try the seafood like the crabs and prawns. But overall, it was a good place for dinner. Service was very decent as well. :
5
I called at 530pm to order takeaway salted egg fried crab, salted egg steam crab and chilli crab. Food were ready when I arrived at 6pm. Waitress was very friendly and patient when I asked abt the cost of the crab, she told me it's $68/kg so my 3 crabs totalled $194. She also told me that it's not all Sri Lanka crabs, it's a mixture of crabs but of good quality. We enjoyed the crab alot, the salted egg sauce and chilli gravy were superb. While it's pricy, we were glad that the crabs taste good.
5
Have been a regular at K.E.K. for a while now. My family loves the steamed fishhead and prawn rolls, whereas I love the moon hor fun (flat rice noodles with raw egg) The hor fun and fried rice are infused with the wok hei (the scent of the wok?) and are seriously delicious. The great service they render is the cherry on top. No matter how much a customer is spending in the restaurant - be it a mere $4 - you get their efficient and polite service. That is what I truly like about them - they are great with their craft and yet they are humble
3
The branch that I visit is at 200 Pandan Garden, #01-12, Singapore 609336.This is the place that you can taste Zi Char cook to give you another different tastebuds experience.It may be expensive (about average $12/person) but the taste is worth trying.But if you are someone who do not like to have a strong taste, do remember to tell them in advance to have your food to be less salty as their food are quite heavy in taste
5
Everyone comes here for the chili crab.. which is not bad..
The boss is friendly and came out to chat before closing time..
4
This restaurant has many good dishes with reasonable price. Need to book in advance if you want Air-condition room

Wanted to dine at Immanuel's French kitchen but it happened to be the closed. So we decided on zi char and woah were we amazed at how good the food was. Ordered the golden pork ribs which were delightful! No bone! Not that im lazy but not having to pry meat off the bone was definitely a plus. The beancurd with meat was yummy as well , a signature dish i believe. Their best the seafood horfun with egg gravy. To be honest, i thought all hor fun had egg gravy and wouldnt it be weird without??? Haha but oh wells. It was yummy! The gravy wasnt too starchy, texture of horfun was good and it had the zi char smell (if you know what i mean, esp if u have zi char often enough..lol!) And the seafood was fresh! The uncle (probably the owner) was really nice to us and brought us green chilli to accompany our horfun! Uber friendly! Going to bring my parents back there
5
Must Try for this menu. It is very yummy. Everytime I go there never miss to order this. With fresh crab and big size. And another is SAMBAL KANGKUNG.มาร้านนี้ เมนูประจำที่ผมสั่งคือ ปูในซอสครีมไข่ (Salted egg crab) เนื้อปูสด จึงมีรสชาตหวาน ทำสดๆ ใหม่ๆ ไม่เหมือนบางร้าน พอลูกค้าเยอะ ทำไว้ก่อน พอแกะแล้วเนื้อเหลือนิดเดียว แต่ที่นี่ปูตัวใหญ่จึงทำให้เมื่อแกะแล้ว จะได้ทานเนื้อปูเต็มๆ คำ แล้วก็อีกเมนู ผัดผักบุ้ง ก็อร่อย ทานกับข้าวสวยร้อนๆ และปิดท้ายด้วยขนมหวานมาตัดคาวได้เป็นอย่างดี ร้านเปิดเฉพาะมื้อเที่ยง และเย็
4
This is my 3rd visit and I find the food is good as compared to your usual HDB zi char. Has some unique dishes like the mingzhu roll which I think is a must try. Service staff were friendly and serving of food was prompt. It is also good value for money, a dinner below S$50 can be had for 3 adults + 1 child with 4 dishes (no seafood) plus drinks.Place gets crowded after 6pm on weekends
3
Was impressed during my first visit 3 months ago but on return visit tonight, food was kinda disappointing. Salted egg crab was very rich & yummy! Chilli crab, steamed fish weren't as tasty while vege's gravy was too thick and oily. Suspect inconsistencies were due to numerous chef

My colleague and I came to Alexandra Village recently and we had lunch at this eatery. It’s a Zi Char stall located at the bottom of a HDB block. It’s a stone’s throw away from the food centre.This was the only stall at the coffee shop. It’s open-air. They have another area in the opposite block that’s air-conditioned. But the seating there is limited and the staff will transport food over to the other area on trays with transparent food covers.  Here are the highlights from our meal:- Sliced pig's liver: This was served in a hot claypot. Sauce was really hearty. Must eat it quickly so that the liver doesn't over-cook! It's good! - Coffee pork ribs. The second best item for lunch today. The coffee aroma hits you the moment the plate lands in the table. Love the caramelised outer layer of the ribs, which were boneless! - Kang Kong with Cuttlefish: This doesn't look like much, but it was the highlight of my meal. It had pork lard, yes many pieces of it in the dish. The sauce wasn't overly sweet and its mildly spicy. There was a layer of sambal atop the ingredients alongside brusged peanuts and a generous sesame seeds.- 'Moonlight Rice Noodles': The moon represents my heart. This is the '月光河粉' or. The flat white rice noodles were stir-fried with dark soy sauce and a raw egg yolk was placed right in the middle, before serving. After the obligatory photo of the dish, the egg yolk was mixed in. There's seafood - prawns and squid, cut Chinese sausage, bean sprouts, vegetable and more pork lard in it.- ‘Mingzhu Roll’: This was 'tau pok' or dry bean curd, fillled with sauteed button mushrooms, Chinese parsley, a ham slice, a prawn and a whole salted egg yolk. It's deep-fried and cut in half. Served with a mayonnaise sauce. The salted egg yolk is flattened and in the process, it became less salty. The meal costs $60. We left with happy bellies and good memories. It’s also good to come for lunch, as it’s not as busy as dinner time

Introduced by a coll.The claypot liver is SUPER YUMMY!Recommended order: 1) Claypot liver2) Ikan Bilis veg3) Prawn Paste chicken4) Coffee Pork RibsCrab is normal.But still I love this placeThey have an aircon area too which is more expensive.If there is no haze, coffeeshop will do
5
You have to order the salted egg yolk crab steamed - this will provide you with lots of salted egg yolk gravy which is just YUMMY GOODNESS. There's also the really awesome claypot liver which is always done perfectly! The other stellar dishes for you to consider would be the 3 egg spinach, coffee ribs and drunken prawns. The place provides a great seafood restaurant ambiance between the choice of a aircon room, or the outdoor seating. This is a MUST TRY PLACE! Look them up online and pay them a visit!
4
Because of the haze, our family tried to reserve a table in the small air-conditioned dining room at Keng Eng Kee Seafood but it was already full. Fortunately, the haze was not serious on the day of our dinner and our outdoor dining was fine.The restaurant is located in a HDB housing estate. Don't expect a pleasant decor or a nice dining ambience. There are none anyway. Food is served on a large round table that is covered with a plastic sheet that is thrown out along with the food waste.Food was large portioned and good for this type of restaurants. Because of our orders of crabs, prawns and venison, the dinner wasn't cheap. All things considered, we had a good and hearty dinner
5
If I have to tell you how good they are, you haven't been having good food.
Try their signature Claypot Stewed Sea-Cucumber and Duck, HK-style Song Fish-head and Yam Ring.
Confirmed die-die must try.
5
As a Malaysian, I find that we come to a point where we can't accept that Singapore food is better than Malaysia (I pretty much enjoy the competition though), but, there are exception, and KEK is one of them. I really enjoyed my dinner at KEK. I ordered a claypot sitr fried pork belly, a stir fried vege and a yue guang he fen (moonlight kuey tiow?). The food is full of "wok hei" and good for value. Will come again
4
This is a typical Singapore-style "zhi char"/ seafood restaurant, with all the usual dishes one would expect from establishments like this. Food is hearty and family style, so don't expect skinny salads here. Their specialty is crab, and we had it done in 2 ways- with black pepper and salted egg yolk sauce. The latter was nice, rich and creamy, the former was a tad too salty for me. Coffee pork ribs had a really strong coffee flavor, so depending on your taste, you will either like it or hate it. We also had some deep fried stuffed rolls which were best eaten hot. All in all, a fun place for a meal with family and friends

With a craving for a decadent mud crab dinner, we ventured out for this kopitiam style restaurant earlier this week, over the familiar names in East Coast Park.They also have an an airconed annex but you have to book several days in advance to secure a table there.They were 9 of us, and as was expected, we over ordered, trusting the waitress's recommendations, not checking the menu.We enjoyed every dish: yam ring veg, coffee pork, ginger/ spring venison on hot plate, steam fish, lotus root soup; spinach in 3 way egg... Still when the crab steamed salted egg yolk came as the dinner finale, we could still relish it with a second helping of steamed buns. Sure, it's the company that made the experience, enhanced by a magnum bottle of cab sav (nominal $2 corkage). And we we're not unhappy with the bill which was under $400.I give it a it 4 out of 5 rating for the food, and minus half a point for the subpar service. We were shown to a huge table, more suited for 12-15 people. We asked to downsize as it was a challenge for people seating opposite one another to have a conversation and to reach for food on the other side of the table in the absence of a lazy Susie. But the waitress vehemently insisted otherwise. So as not to create a scene, we relented and were 'spread out'.Also, the crew was rather reluctant to clear the dishes when they started to pile up.Kopitiam style or not, we would expect an appropriate level of service when you dine out

Keng Eng Keck Seafood Restaurant remains faithful to its humble beginningsas a hawker stall, still operating in a kopitiam (coffeeshop) setting though theynow an air-conditioned annexed.We brought an overseas friend for dinner and generally found the servicefairly prompt and the food generally good.We had their Mixed Platter of sotong cruellers, mingzhu rolls and prawn rolls.Their mingzhu rolls are unusual. The other items in the platter are so-so.We also had a simple dish of Hong Kong kailan, half a roast chicken and theirsignature salted egg crab.The crab dish was well done. The salted egg sauce was thick & creamy. Crabsthese days are expensive, so be forewarned. The seasonal price is now SGD 65per kilo !I give the food, a rating of 6.5 out of 10.Their website is : www.kek.com.s

The must-have dish each time I'm here is definitely the yue guang he fen (moonlight hor fun). It has a very good wok hei which I crave for pretty often. The dishes are very cheap and are priced nett! Easily the cheapest seafood dining option on my list. One of my recent visits with the fiance included dishes like the moonlight hor fun, a salted egg crab, cereal sotong, brinjal with minced meat and anchovies and a packet of hor fun to go and it cost us only $89! Reservations are recommended especially if you would like to dine in the air-conditioned room which has limited seating. If not, you can take the risk of walking in and having to wait for a table at the open-air coffeeshop. This place is definitely one of my favourite super cheap tze char food spots

Last Thursday, I was here with my colleagues for the 3rd times. Their foods are really delicious and with reasonable price. My favorite are the mamai chicken, claypot pig liver, cereal Prawn, salted egg crab and etc.We try to hop to other restaurants everything we have a event. But eventually, we will always miss the food here, that's why we are back again. Must called to book early, if you need to dine with aircon

Walked past this restaurant a number of times but never tried their food. This is our first time and the experience was really good. The staff were really attentive and gave very good suggestion. The food is great and price is reasonable. I will be coming back again. If you want to use the air-conditioned room you will have to make advance booking and the price is the same.

I went here with my Singaporean friends and they did all the ordering. And I think all were flavorful and cooked well.The Ming Zou rolls I think is their best seller, quite delicious. We had the chili crabs, pepper crabs and salted egg crabs and the best one was the salted egg crabs. I also recommend the fried battered squid, the roast chicken and the leafy vegetables with eggs. Both the marmite pork and chicken were good -- don't worry, if you are not a marmite fan, the marmite flavor was not very strong. Everyone raved about the liver dish but I am not a liver fan so I cannot comment myself.The service was good and quick. Am just not sure if the ordering will be easy if I was not with chinese speaking folks. I hope their menus have photos!I have been here twice for dinner but both at very odd times -- at 5pm and another at 930pm -- so the parking was quite easy. If you come early, I suggest booking a table inside the air conditioned room so its not too hot. If you are doing a late dinner, then its ok to sit outside

A good friend brought us to this place for dinner, I must say after having the salted egg crab at Mellben I was not expecting much. Boy, was I wrong! Don't get me wrong, Mellben is awesome. Their salted egg crabs are both up there, but taste somewhat differently. Can't pin down how, they just do. We were a group of 5 and we ordered 4 salted egg crabs, finished them off! We also ordered the following, which exceeded expectations as well. Claypot Prawns in Herbal Soup -great starter, the soup tasted refreshing, the prawns were fresh and juicy. We also ordered vegetable with preserved egg -fresh crunchy veggies with a generous helping of my favorite preserved egg! Also ordered other stuff as well -yes we were very hungry! Want to try the Nonya Fish Head next time, the deep fried squid with egg yolk, etc.Call ahead for the crab as they might run out. They have a good beer selection as well.Staff were very friendly, they treated us like we were regulars. The place is a bit out of the way, so after dinner they called taxis for us, with one of the staff sending us off. Great food, great customer service... who doesn't want to go back

Very good clay pot bee hoon crab, tofu and sambal kang kong. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner despite having to wait for a while for a table as well as our food as it was very packed

Arranged for our family dinner but was rather disappointed. The fried salted egg crab wasn't as nice as expected, it sticks to the shell and the sauce is too salty. Perhaps it's a public holiday that day, therefore food went below average.

My parents and I went over there for a weeiend dinner.We need to queue up before we get assigned to our designated seats by one of their unfriendly female staff with ponytail.We ordered the vegetables, salted egg crab and prawn rolls.The prawn roll is still quite good as usual but the vegetables are not as good for elderly.It seems like the vegetables are just chopped and kinda hard to chew.Another big disappointment is the salted egg crab when they deep fried the crab until the meat sticks to the shell . It's kinda hard and tiring just to eat the crab

If you looking for aircon environment, pls call in in advance to make reservation. Otherwise, you probably will be seated outdoor or indoor depending on fans. In the night should still be bearable.Food wise pretty good if you ignore presentation. The salted egg crab is pretty good, but price is pretty like normal restaurant price.The yam ring is also nice if you like yam. The coffee pork rib is also pretty good

I went with high expectations after reading rave reviews but was a tad disappointed. The Moonlight Hor Fun was too salty for my taste. Sambal Fried Rice was above average but not outsanding. Fried Rice was average. On the plus side, their portions are quite generous but price is on the high side given the humble surroundings and the average quality of food

i had wanted to try keng eng kee (KEK) the last time the few of us were doing a hawker & zi char tour but had never gotten to it.was watching a teochew classical tunes (operatic) concert at singapore concert hall at 7.30pm by ngee ann cultural centre, singapore teochew federation & nan hua opera (南华儒剧社), so decided to have early dinner at KEK on 9.6.2014.we were there at 5pm on a monday. the indoor aircon seating was fully booked, & 1/2 of the outdoor seating at the coffeeshop was also reserved with the names on the tables.famous dishes at KEK includes claypot liver, moonlight nor fun, mingzhu rolls (明珠卷) & salted egg crab etc.#1 i do like liver but am not particularly fond of claypot liver which is like a liver overkill. we ordered it anyhow & it turned out to be really good! the liver was not overcooked, had great wine flavours & very sweet & just the right texture. an excellent dish! chopstick chopstick#2 we were deciding between black beans bitter gourd with sliced snakehead (生鱼) or a song fish head(松鱼头). the server recommended the fish head nonya style.chopstick it was very good, the sauce was the same as the very nice fish head at fortune seafood but dryer & less curry. i would think that angkoli (red snapper) which fortune used would go better than 松鱼 for this dish.#3 cuttle fish kang kong was competent & tasty, the sweet sauce though was kind of overpowering.#4 the 明珠卷 mingzhu roll (6 pieces) was good too. however we did not really need this dish. the other 4 dishes were already too big for 3pax, so we tapao (take out) remaining 3 pieces.#5 the moonlight dry nor fun was a good dish. it was a strange concoction combining char kuay teow with hor fun(河粉), and came with chinese sausage & also prawns & squid with thick hor fun. it was not really my favourite. i would prefer the usual hor fun or san lor hor fun (生捞河粉) to this.there was no service or get. the bill came up to S$60 for 5 dishes for 3pax. the food would easily have served 4pax. i would rate KEK on par with kok sen & much better than two chefs. i would expect the song fish head(松鱼头) at 香港街珍记 (Hong Kong Street Chun Kee) to be better but then the menu range at the latter is small.this definitely a eating place that i will come back again!

Likes : The non-fuss ambience (casual dining, yellow plastic chair), The food (we ordered chili crab with mantou, salted yolk crab, oatmeal butter prawn, pokcoy garlic, beancurd with beef), The price (we ordered way too much so it's SGD 155 - cheap), and again the food (it was so good it had to be mentioned twice).Dislikes : The waiters spoke broken English so make sure bring a Chinese-speaking friends.Tip for you (you're welcome) : Taxi drivers may not familiar with the location - just tell them to drop you off at the building across Alexandra Hospital.PS : The food was exceptional - really really exceptional

Its hard to resist ordering more and more dishes at Keng Eng Kee. The food was simply delicious and priced reasonably. We had the kang kong cuttlefish, stir fried bee hoon with crab, salted egg yolk crab, claypot pork liver, claypot prawns in herbal soup, fried mee sua and in the end, couldn't resist but to order another chili crab with steamed man tou. The best dish has to be the salted egg yolk crabs which was cooked with the right amount of curry leaves and gravy. Most places that serves this dish has a tendency of putting in too much curry leaves which kills the taste of the crab. At Keng Eng Kee, the chef had the good sense to balance it so that the the natural sweetness of the crab meat comes through. The chili crab is pretty decent as well and coupled with the light, fluffy steamed man tou, one bun will not seem enough. The herbal soup from the claypot prawns was subtle and tasty. Not overwhelming in chinese herbs taste. All in all, a great meal at a good price for 5 persons

Friends went here for dinner and it was 'mind blowing'...1) 'Song Fish' this is a fresh water fish and it was excellent...soft, and the sauce was perfect.2) Clay pot Pigs Liver...again, the sauce....The rest were good also...Service was good...I cannot find fault with this place...reservations is a MUST for weekends...or wait for 30minutes or more for a table. They also have a section that has air-condition...just across from the main dinning hall. Personally, the chilli and pepper crabs were better than Long Beach, and cheaper too!!

was there with 4 friends. had prawn paste chick wings, salted yolk squid, salted yolk crab, chili crab, claypot liver, sambal kangkong, fried mee sua, fried hor fun. my fave was the squid - realy crispy with just-right saltiness. my friends liked the salted yolk crab. the liver was at the beginning, till it got overly cooked in the hot claypot. good food overall in a heartland kopitiam
