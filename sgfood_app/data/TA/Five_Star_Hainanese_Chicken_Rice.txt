Miss Jee was a lovely help in organising our meal. Great fun and friendly. Busy place with all the locals as well.
5
Arch rivals for a long time, I prefer the roasted chicken here, rice not as fragrant as Boon Tong but still delicious. Chilli and close fight between the two hard to decide
4
We ordered some for take away and the order was well managed. Saw that they do serve other dishes apart from chicken rice and will definitely like to come back to try them out. The roasted chicken is good and the rice fluffy and aromatic.
5
Great service and food at unbelievably low prices. Always reliable and tasty. If full pop next door Sin Hoi Sai Eating house.

Food was normal only, you can find better ones outside with cheaper price. Only good is theres an option of airconditional seatings or openspace.

I had take away dinner from them. The famous dish is the chicken, but other dishes are also good. I ate their tofu dish and it was really tasty.For chicken rice, chicken was tender and the sauce is very tasty.The price is quite reasonable and affordable. This is my favorite place to grab chicken rice
4
It seems that the chicken cooked here is to the authentic recipe and very popular. In the evenings the tables are full and the queue for the takeaway service is long. The menu offers plenty of options other than their famous chicken. We ate there on several occasions and it was pretty good
4
Visited this place for dinner after a hectic evening at Gardens by the bay. It's a street-side cafe with tables laid out on the pavement under awnings. Seems quite popular with the locals. This place is famous for Hainanese food. So the hainanes chicken rice was ordered. We also ordered an iced barley drink (?). Apparently that drink is popular with the Chinese! I wouldn't try this liquid ever, even though it is said to be good for the digestive system!Good place for a quick meal
4
The menu is not that different than most restaurants around. The difference is the quality of the ingredients (above average) and the lower prices, since most clients are locals. A huge chili crab for 70$ was almost 50% less than the most popular downtown restaurants. Has an indoor and outdoor area. Recommende
4
One of the best Hainanese chicken that I've tried, the chicken is soft and tender to the bite, the meat is tasty even without the sauce, and then the sauce simply enhances the taste even more. The service is very fast, the staff also make good recommendations on the menu
4
Service fast order taken from ipad very efficient .Food for my 1 packet Chicken Rice in 10 min. Food serve with Rice Steaming Hot .They packet the rice separated from the Chicken..Chicken was soft smooth and very Fresh.
4
Review by Dr Sim. The food is good. Service is acceptable. Generally value for money. Tourists can visit. Go to Beauty World MRT. Regards Dr Sim
4
Great taste, great service and really fast service. Sunday night at 9pm and still busy. Roast chicken rice as good as any around.
5
Back again. This is my go to restaurant whenever I first land in Singapore just for the Chicken Rice. Always great food and efficient service. Gets busy from 7pm Get there early order the chicken and a cold beer and then watch the luxury cars start pulling up honking their horns as staff run out to hand over the take away orders. Lively scene and great for people/luxury car watching
3
Mixed rating because we usually dine in and go away satiated. Chilli with ginger is excellent, rice is hot and chicken is tender and succulent. Last week my spouse had a craving but was unable to leave work so I bought takeaway for him. The order of steamed chicken breast rice turned out to be a huge disappointment. Was given 4 slices of boneless thigh meat and rice that was not sufficiently cooked.
3
It was an outlet which I used to take pretty often for a period of time and love. Years later when I revisit, the service was still very warm but somehow we felt the quality of chicken has dropped a bit. Chicken rice is not a special dish that is difficult to find in Singapore. It is not that it tasted bad, but somehow we felt it was nothing special...Will definitely revisit, perhaps this time round with more headcount and a well balanced opinion
4
I'm no chicken rice expert. I couldn't blind taste test the Maxwell hawker chicken rice and pick out the subtleties in flavour above this little gem, but to be honest, do I need to? It's fantastic.They offer classic chicken stock boiled rice, or a healthier brown rice option, as well as terrific boiled and roasted chicken. I prefer half and half, with my chicken left on the bone, but they'll happily give you a plate of breast meat if that's your preference.They've a wide selection of green vegetables to partner up with your lunch, and if you want to stray further afield the menu is quite varied. I've tried their deep fried tofu, and if you're hungry it's a nice side dish, but I've not tried anything else - why bother?! The chicken rice is the star of the show, and a great choice if you're on the East Coast
4
Husband and I tried many "famous" chicken rice stalls around Singapore. We can have it almost every day. What brought us back to Fivestar every time is the way they prepare their chicken. It has this Jelly like substance in between the skin and meat that requires some skills and the right type of chicken. Definitely cannot be frozen (for the tourist). If you are craving for hainanese type of chicken rice (slow cooked), they have 3 outlets and drive through service. Download their app. For those who are avoiding 'chicken skin' for whatever reasons, you still can enjoy the thick smooth chunk of meat. In east coast, they open till 2am! And, they hv other variety of dishes that taste just as delicious. Love the deep fried baby squid at $13. You won't regret it. Order it!
4
The rice was a little starchier and oily compare to other chicken rice we had. I prefer my rice to be a little al dente. But their roasted chicken and steamed chicken was wonderful. The meat was juicy and flavourful. No very fatty. The chicken was on a bed of sliced cucumbers and a good splash of light soya sauce and sesame oil. The chilli paste was one of the spiciest I have tried and it hits all the right spots. Has a good amount of garlicky taste to it. The menu has a variety of dishes worth trying. It gets a crowded during the weekends so be sure to visit them on the off peak periods

21-05-2017 11:05AM ....... I really the food and fast service.... But today! I'm very much disappointed for the service given by staff! .... outside I ordered roasted chicken and take away of drinks by one Chinese lady.... But suddenly even the food they did on packets or for take out. Which I told her "only drinks for take out" ..... And I smiled to her and say it's ok! I'm inside the restaurant.. and about to start to eat my food coz I'm very hungry.... suddenly one more lady was confronted me that I cannot eat the food that "I ordered to your FIVE STAR restaurant" I ask her Why? I bought it here? She said I ordered take away....I told her it wasn't my fault it's the lady who taken my order... She told me that she will changed the food cause it's different pricing! I'm very hungry and I need to wait again......Take note just one table and two ladies are inside having there meal.... two staff on my side having their staff meal....really Disappointed!
3
Fast service and a quick and cheap meal at an outdoor hawker centre type setting...cost us under $25 for meals for two and non alcoholic drinks
4
That was amazing authentic cuisine.
The atmosphere was amazing and the food was great also.
If you are after genuine regional food give this a try. It's where the locals go!
5
Visited Five Star twice on a recent trip to Singapore and had two excellent meals. This is not a fancy restaurant, it is small with seats outside and some inside where there is aircon. The service is fast and friendly. It is also child friendly, our seven month old granddaughter was made a great fuss of and enjoyed her rice. The menu is extensive and I can recommend the yang zhou fried rice, the imperial ribs and the sweet and sour pork. There are of course many other dishes. I am looking forward to returning in September
4
Dont be confused...The restaurant name is 5 star restaurant...although I believe chicken rice is their signature dish but they do serve other singapore dishes like chili crabs etcTheir chicken rice is good but probably not 5 star...But definitely better value and taste than the one from the famous 5 star hotel in orchard road...The price is very reasonable and you can choose to have other dishes too not just chicken rice.
4
Every time i'm in Singapore, i will always have my chicken rice fix here.Chicken is soft and juicy, Service is good, fast and efficient. Menus are listed in English. The service staff speaks good english as well.Worth a trip, and once you've tried it, you'll be back for more !
4
Frequent this eatery. Famous for their "kampong chicken" which translates to free range chicken ( not farmed broilers).Smaller but a lot more tender and because it isn't fried nor deep-fried, texture matters.The essential condiments - chili, garlic chili, ginger, black sauce - are good.Local favorite side dishes are listed in menu with accompanying photos so there's no guessing.Off peak hours even allowed us to bring in cut fruits from next door. The easy going attitude is truly commendable. Service staff are well trained. Several times my foreign friends gladly tipped them forthe attentive service
5
We usually go to Tian Tian but when we were talking to staff at our nearby hotel they recommended we try here.We arrived in the early afternoon and the place was nearly empty. We chose to sit inside in the aircon (not an option at Tian Tian). The lady who served us spoke perfect english so do not fear the language barrier if you are a tourist.They do have a varied menu but we were here for one thing only.The food arrived quickly. The hianese chicken is excellent. It is as good as Tian Tian but we now don't have to trek into the city. Like others have said it is tasty and moist. It comes with the obligatory bowl of soup as well as the green vegetables. However the rice is purchased seperately. We love that you get a tray of condiments so that you can add as much or as little of each as you like. Great for someone like me as I love chilli.The service was excellent and friendly but the restaurant was empty. There is also a doorbell style button on the table to summon wait staff if you need them.My only criticism would be that when we arrived, a plate of soaked peanuts (a local snack) was placed on the table. The waitress explained what they were - so we tried them. When we went to pay the bill we had been charged for them. Also we used the moist towelettes that were placed on the table and got charged extra for these too.Look it's only a couple of dollars, but it's more about the feeling you have been 'tricked'. It's like being given a gift and once you open it being asked to pay for it.If you like Hianese chicken, or your new to it, avoid the trek into the city and the 45 minute (or more) queues at Maxwell and come here

Very nice. One of the top 3 chicken rice stall that my family will revisit again and again. When kids are hungry, they will ask for 5 star chicken rice!!!Personally, I really like the call-order-pickup service where u simply call their hotline and make your order with your car plate number. They will bring to your car when u arrived by the main road. Awesomely convenient and staffs are generally friendly. One week ago just saw that they've launched an mobile apps... will try it in my next order.
4
Was treated by local friends. Signature chicken is very tender n softer than I expected. I was amazed by other special dishes. Such as fried dough with fish meats, sambo vege, salty egg with fried shrimps and three types eggs with vege. It's mainly Chinese dishes and transformed into Singaporean style. Better check on photos I took. I recommend this local restaurant to travelers.
3
If you plan to visit Singapore, paying a visit to Katong area is a smart idea. Dozens of small restaurants and shops in a typical area near to the airport and not far away from the city center.If this is the place where you find yourself for lunch or dinner this small restaurant is a good option. Good food, right portions to wash away your hunger, the look is not fancy or hip but be assured you'll have a good meal at an affordable price. Of course be careful if you are not used to hot and spicy because here hot and spicy is the normal thing. Careful!!! One water bottle 0,5 lt, one prawn with hot sauce ( de rigeur...:-) white riec and broth 20 SGD
5
classic Singapore chinese fare . The hainanese chicken rice is what they are famous for, but i liked the other stuff in quite a varied menu. simple eatery type restauarant. great food good value
4
For chicken rice lovers, this should not be a miss. Cosy environment, service is quick and prices are affordable. Paid around $25 for half a chicken (roasted & white mixed), one drink and 4 plate of rice.
4
Dun miss this local food once u r in Singapore ~ good service at affordable price. They even help me pack well since I'm planning to pack it back home. These 3 menus are highly recommended to all new visitors :) super yummy!
5
It was my first time Chicken Rice and was very delicious! The staff was so nice and friendly that they talked to me and taught me their recommended way to have it. I definitely go there next time, too.
5
The best in town, loved their chicken rice for long time already and whenever we go Singapore Must always come here to eat their hainanese chicken rice and tofu
4
A must try food if you are arround katong. Quick and polite service they gave. The waiter will explain about the menu. Good one
4
good for a casual dinner out with family or spouse. near east coast park and many restaurants buzzing nearby which makes for a pleasant walk. braised peanuts -so good! chicken rice-very good, i preferred white meat v dark meat. baby kailan not impressive-too oily/watered down
5
We love the experience of eating very good chicken rice sitting by the street side a rare experience in Singapore. The service is fast and good so is the food. This place is famous for Chicken Rice and you must try it.We also order the greens and shrimp omelette to go with our chicken rice. Highly recommemded for chicken rice and the ambulance.
4
appreciate the service rendered by the staff, who went an extra mile to get toddlers bowl n spoon for my 17 mths old without us asking for any. Food was served relatively fast and was tasty. Worth the price and Chicken Rice is a Must to Try. Spicy chili to go along with the fragrant rice
5
This place has been around for ages and I never tire of it. The chicken is moist and tender, the rice is tasty and there is hardly any need for anything after a meal here because it's so satisfying. A must if you like chicken rice
4
delicious, at reasonable cost.
The juicy chicken.... melted on the tongue.
The ingredient is just fine and fit to the most every tongue.
The combination with other dishes.. are fine
4
Five Star has been consistent..some people crib about their chilli.I have had better but it does have a kick to it and i like it!!
We ordered the chicken rice.kailan with garlic and a sweet and sour pork..was super yummy!!a definite go back to place!
4
For tourists wanting to try the local speciality dish, this is a great restaurant. Been twice and the chicken rice was so tasty both times. Its fast (and friendly) service and great value for money. Way better experience than paying in any tourist-trap restaurant.
3
Definitely not five star as per their name. Deserve a 3 star for heir chicken rice. Service was good as I took an early dinner as it was not too crowded.
4
it is a great place to be with friends and neighbors. it is a gd place to check out. food is yummy. i went there with my friends and relatives.
3
Average, overpriced. Standard dropped considerably over the years, while prices keep increasing. There are better chicken rice stores in Katong area.

I originally planned to have Hainanese Chicken Rice at Tian Tian on Joo Chiat Rd. but they are closed now. So... I did a brief research over the web, and this restaurant has a good reviews on TripAdvisor, Google+ and Yelp! so I tried here. I do appreciate those positive reviewers. Thank you guys!This restaurant is not specialized for Hainanese Chicken Rice only, but numbers of items available. However, I am targeting Hainanese Chicken Rice so I asked two orders; one steam white chicken and one brown roasted, in dark meat. Yes, I could choose the parts of chicken. When I arrived this restaurant, I requested air-conditioned indoor seating. They have roadside seating but I did want to sit in a cool place to stop my sweats. ...well, after the chili sauce, I restarted sweating anyway.The chickens are very nicely done, moist and tender, very tasty. Soup is very gentle and the portion was a bit too much... well it's better than nothing. Then the chicken rice has gentle flavor too. Because their sauces and spices, such as ground ginger, creamy chili pepper sauce and sweet-dark soy sauce are very strong, so I have to be careful applying those sauces otherwise the gentle chicken flavors are easily gone. But in any cases, it's quite yummy and I am addicted.Because it was so good, I revisited this restaurant about 3-4 hours later. The service-persons remembered me and took care of me like a king. I had exactly the same, 2 orders of chicken with lime juice, but the chicken were so good, I asked extra rice. That's such good.I'm glad I found a good chicken rice restaurant here, so that I don'y have to make over 300 yards of waiting line at Maxwell food court. That's wasting my trip time
4
Mid range pricing chicken rice that taste good. The basic $5.70 meal for a person is quite filling for an average person. Texture of the chicken is just nice and not too hard. Rice is fragrant, not too oily and not too hard. Dark soya sauce is fragrant and adds flavor to the rice
4
It sells more than Hainanese chicken rice. There is quite a large selection of dishes at reasonable prices. We had several dishes for 6 diners sitting around a round table under the stars or lack the roof given the haze. Dishes include traditional Hainanese pork chop but best was spinach cooked with eggs and century eggs that was served in a mini wok. Then there are traditional desserts such as cendol and ice Kachang served in large glasses that can be shared. Well worth a visit with friends for an evening meal. Limited roadside parking and no MRT nearby but lots of buses
4
This restaurant has been around for a while, but is less crowded than its main competitor on the same stretch of road. The chicken served here is supposedly kampung chicken, which is generally smaller in size but less "fatty". The chicken is nicely done, and other dishes that are good includes bean sprouts with salted fish and pork ribs.We noticed that prices have been creeping up but still fairly reasonable when compared to other restaurants (ie. not hawker stalls). Nevertheless, this is one of the better Hainanese chicken rice restaurant around, and give the other restaurants a run for their money. A point to note - parking on the street is limited, and you may have spend some time looking for a lot.
5
I went some chicken rice restaurant in Singapore visit with my friends. this is the one of those. the foods were very good taste. I wish I'll be there again.
4
If u are in Singapore,something you can't afford to missed out,
Roasted chicken rice it's crispy skin and juicy meat with fresh coconut water makes ur meal jst awesome
Love to go there again and again
4
There are several options in Singapore to try chicken rice. This restaurant is one good choice. If you prefer to eat al fresco this is the place for you. Staff are efficient. They serve other dishes that are good too....liked their sotong and veggies.
4
place is always a safe bet for when you don't know where else to go or what else to eat; food is tasty and not too pricey.
5
Very Singapore way to enjoy one of Singapore national dish Chicken Rice. You sit outside by that i mean on the pavement and its fun and different then eating in an air condition food court or a restaurant. Highly recommended for a family dinner and also to take your foreign guest to experience the Singapore way. On a hot stuffy night it could be a challenging to eat out and eat but no fun without ay sweat!
4
They are several chicken rice restaurant along East Coast Road, 5 star is one of the best chicken rice restaurants you could. It's conveniently located at the main street, not to mention close to Katong 112. Traveler could easily head over through public transportation or Katong 112 shuttle bus. Only 5 mins walk away from the mall. They have other stir fried dishes too. I will give those a try next time as well
2
For years I used to go here to eat my favourite local dish 'chicken rice'. I came back at the end of 2014 and was shocked by the drop in quality. Most of the chicken has bone (even if you order the breast), the rice is dry and less tasty and the prices have gone up. I was extremely disappointed and was forced to look for an alternative, which, luckily, I found just a couple of doors down the street.
4
I have always been a fan of Chicken and Rice and they serve up a really awesome plat of Chicken Rice, their chilli sauce is one of a kind as well! Make sure you order and try the other side dishes as well, a nice lime juice really does compliment the dishes
4
Came to Singapore for Hainan chicken and was planning to goto the other more famous boon Tong Kee but it had a longer line up, so we went to this five star instead per recommendation of a taxi driver. five Star is less renovated but charges more fairly unlike the Boon Tong Kee which charges you everything from plain water to wet paper towels and small portion (yes I also went to Boon Tong Kee). Key comment: Tasty, and I would come again.
5
We love eating at the East Coast Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice. The Chicken Rice is so good and they have other dishes like the Thai Tofu, Baby Kailan in Oyster Sauce, Bean Sprout (Taugeh) with Salted Fish and many more. These are our favourites. My husband has this heavenly look everything he takes a bite.Take buses 10, 10e, 12, 14, 14e, 32, 40 or a taxi. At the moment the MRT does not go there. Located opposite The Holy Family Church in Katong. Address 191 East Coast Road Singapore 428897 (Katong)Tel: 6344 5911Mon.-Sun. 09:00-03:00www.fivestarchickenrice.comThey also do takeaways. You can call in advance for pick ups.MUST TRY!!!
4
one of the best chicken rice in Singapore: fragrant hainam rice & delicious roasted chicken. Always come here whenever I'm around east area. Good value. Most of the waitress speak little English but they understand you clearly.
5
This was our first meal in Singapore (lunch) and I was hanging out for some chicken rice. Your kampong chicken rice was so tender and delicious and hit the spot. Staff are very pleasant and helpful when ordering
5
It was just a few paces from my hotel. Loved their chicken rice. Both roasted and boiled. I'm not a fan of crabs, but their chilly crab tasted very good too! Loved it. :)
5
My young son ate half a chicken and rice for dinner. This traditional Hainan Chicken and rice has been most Singaporean and mine favourite.I always go to this restaurant at least twice, everytime I visit Singapore.Any visitors visiting Singapore must try this restaurant Hainan chicken and rice.For me, I will always continue my eating there
4
I personally prefer Five Star Chicken Rice to its rival Boon Tong Kee. (Sorry, BTK fans!) As I only take breast meat, I feel that the breast meat at Five Star Chicken Rice is not tough and chewy nor soggy and overly seasoned like other places. The rice is heavenly and not too soft. What I really like is the chili sauce. It is spicy yet flavorful. I really enjoy tucking into a plate of chicken rice here. For me, this is comfort food
4
We love going to its branch at Cheong Chin Nam. Always order whole white chicken or sometimes roasted chicken along with some side dishes like prawn roll , vegetables. I love their chilli , spicy and invitingâ€¦. we never get sick of eating their chicken rice , in fact we always look forward to retur
4
The last time i ate here was years ago. Brought my wife and we had half roast chicken, 3 rice and hotplate beancurd. Everything was fine just that the a bit saltish today. Rmbr to ask them to put less sesame oil and sauce for it to be less salty.
4
OK, the chicken rice may not be among the best in Singapore (although it is not bad, and it's kampong chicken), but this place is great for takeaway service. You just call, and 15-20 minutes later, you just come and collect. They even prepare the change for you (or take payment by credit card). The ngo hiang is excellent
3
I had always thought that five star at East Coast was one of the better chicken rice restaurants in town. Serving portions for the chicken and rice were excellent and the chili sauce packs a punch. However it does seem that in recent months, the rice and chicken have been shrinking to an extent that I feel it's no longer worth the money that I pay! What's more crazy is that it is in fact cheaper for me to go next door to Sin Hoi Sai to eat than to eat at five star
3
Decided to try this again as we were in the neighborhood. The last time we had it was in 2011 and the chicken then was juicy, tasty and plump. Perhaps it is a sign of the changing economy, but the chicken today was bland and skinny. On the plus side, the rice was still delicious but that is at most a side dish
