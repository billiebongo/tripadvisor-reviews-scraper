Have been patronising this stall for many years. Food is above average and their chicken wings are large compared to other similar stalls. Worth the queue!

The chicken wings and chili are the winners. Crisp and freshly fried chicken wing which was well flavored. The chili was spicy and pungent. Just the right kick!
Can't say much about the rest. Bee hoon was bland and fried egg was overcooked.

All i have to say is .... when it says ... best chicken wings .... it truly lives up to expectation. Ensure you accompany with a plate of noodles. Enjoy.

One must be patience to enjoy one of the best chicken wings in Singapore. There is always a queue. It is at a old coffee shop. May look a bit "dingy" and being in the queue on a hot Singapore day is not fun. BUT, the wings are divine. They have bee-hoon and other condiments but it is the wings. They are always freshly fried given the turnover. Be prepared to order as much as you can eat as you do not want to queue again for more. There are customers who order by the tray. Enjoy

It's a no frills stall in a coffee shop, with tables and chairs under a canopy for customers...and there are many; some in office attire, others in shorts & Tshirts.The two of us ordered the fried beehoon and fried noodles respectively as our base, Steamed Cabbage, Taiwanese sausage and Ngor Hiang (pork & prawn roll) and of course the fried chicken wings! At only $1.20 each, the fragrant crispy-on-the- outside and juicy & tender-on-the- inside chicken wings were worth the wait and braving the hot & humid atmosphere!! Just order your Coke or Iced Tea/coffee to cool you down

The offerings is just ordinary snacks of bee hoon, noodles and everything else deep fried. The "famous" wings are very saltish to taste. Perhaps it is next to the parking lot where one could see the meter maids coming, that makes it it popular with taxi drivers and delivery guys. Not cheap also
