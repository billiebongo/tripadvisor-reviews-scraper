It is nice. We bought one whole piece of fromage but with that small pieces, it costed us $35, which is very expensive!!!

Itâ€™s a little pricy maybe but no other place in Singapore sells cheesecakes where you can taste all the goodness of dairy products with every mouthful. Their fromage langues de chat are also excellent!

The double fromage is definitely a must try! I've had the original and the strawberry flavored one (limited edition) but I feel the original is much nicer and from the feedback from friends who tried the matcha double cheese, original wins hands down. You have the option of buying the cake frozen or chilled so there's always the possibility to buy and store it in the freezer for a few weeks. Their cheese cookies are also quite nice for those who like a slightly stronger cheese flavour
