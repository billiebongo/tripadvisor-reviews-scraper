I had the vegetarian thunder tea rice and enjoyed it. The flavor was unique and quite good. The others in my party didn't really enjoy it so it may be an acquired taste.

value for money food which at first may seem tasteless, but the flavour gets into you slowly but surely . definitely a must try for visitors

The combination of textures is just amazing. It's delicious either as a vegetarian meal, or if you take all the protein add-ons. No wonder people queue up from 11:30 am and can stretch pretty far - always the longest line at Lau Pa Sat!

- When it comes to FnB, I am very particular about their services. Do NOT expect any good service here!o Rice rich in flavor. o Brown rice.o One of the best Lei Cha (Thunder Tea) you can taste in Singapore. o Soup is tasty BUT it could have been more bitter. x Soup not bitter enough. x 2/5 star service. x Quite pricy because it is in CBD area. - This is a Hakka traditional dish where their rice is topped with various kind of vegetables, toufu, peanuts etc.You will usually eat them with the soup poured into the bowl of rice. i. Normal dish costs 5.50SGD. Add on will go to 8.50SGD.

I have a weakness for Thunder tea rice. I have had many variants of the same. Some in the original form and some with some add ons. I just love the green tea soup that comes along. And yes, the after feeling of the meal is good. Full yet light and the health benefits attached with this dish are just a bonus. I usually ask for more anchovies with my serving.

I frequented the location at Telok Ayer Market often for lunch for one delicious reason - the Thunder Tea Rice (all vegetarian) was a big bowl of aromatic deliciousness. Priced at less than S$6 (around $5 CDN), this dish filled me up at lunch and sometimes I even had enough to save it for a pre-dinner appetizer. Located in the beautifully restored Telok Ayer Market, which was airy, spacious and pleasant, the place can't be complemented for it's service but that mattered not as it was the bowl I came for anyway

I believe thunder tea rice is not for everyone likeness.This hakka dish is green in colour and a bit disgusting for The newbie.AS for me, I love it ! Honestly speaking, At first, The taste is a bit weird. After that, i crave for more.I read from The article, that this dishes is very complicated To be prepared. For 5.8$ per bowl , i feel this dish is A bit expensive. Anyway,since it's a bit difficult to prepare and find this, i Only can pay and enjoy...
