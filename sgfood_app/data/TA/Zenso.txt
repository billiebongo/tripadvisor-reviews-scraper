The food at this place is tasty and very reasonably priced. The staff is bright, warm and efficient. The vegetarian options are great. I loved my meals here, this week

Had a meal here on spur of the moment (family of 8), Larb and Pad Thai were excellent. Chicken with Basil was a lot spicier than expected, but delicious. Good service & prices.
5
Delicious larb gai, green curry, fried rice and basil chicken
My absolute favourite in a row of Thai restaurants zenso stands out
The owner always makes you feel at home

Terribly small place so you have a fair chance of sitting outside in the tropical heat. Service is prompt. The food has just the right amount of spice, not overly spicy hot like some Thai restaurants. Great place for affordable Thai food if you're in the area. But it's not a place I'll make a special effort to go to if i'm not passing by

Always looking for authentic tasting Thai food at affordable prices without buying a plane ticket. This place hits the spot. The restaurant is small with some additional outside seating. It has a small staff, but the server was very responsive when asked. The chicken coconut soup was very tasty. We also had the pad thai and Zenso Mussamum Chicken curry. Both dishes were good. I'd recommend if you are not fussy about the atmosphere

Came back here again recently for a 2nd visit. This time we opted for the lunch set (at just $7) and supplemented with an additional Pad Thai. Total cost was around $22 or so for 2 people (which was pretty good value). But I found the set lunch was a little too spicy for me (some kind of minced chicken dish with way too much chilli). Good value for money though so I expect I'l return some time in the future

I love the people and the food. I literally go there everyday and it's like my second home. The kitchen staff are like family and they give the homely feels! It's super affordable and crazy delicious. I'd die to get Zenso to my city in India

Came here for lunch today and opted for one of the set lunches including a drink for just $7. We supplemented with a Pad Thai and the total bill was still only $21 for the 2 of us. Friendly service and decent food. Well worth another visit

Just had lunch at Sunshine Plaza in Bencoolen Street. Random choice. We ordered seafood tom yam soup, basil chicken and kailan vegetable in oyster sauce and white rice to go with it. Tasty and satisfying. Limited seats in the air con area. And a bit warm. You can hear another table conversation. There are also tables along the corridor too alfresco. No service charge nor Gst so very basic service but food served is prompt once ordered. Will go back again. They have take away as well. P.S. Dishes are predominantly Thai than Jap

I got addicted to spicy food cause of them! Very nice green curry chicken, pad thai, chicken basil, glass noodles! Yum! Affordable! Delicious! Place to go to during lunch!

Am not much of asian food lover,but this one has got it. One of the few places in SG, where thai food tastes like in Thailand. They also serve Japan food.
At the end, worth to tip them!

Had a lovely family dinner over authentic Thai food at very reasonable prices!! The restaurant is located in a quiet part of town, close to NAFA. The food was good and authentic. Great place for a quiet dinner for two as well üëçüèª

Good thai food, best i have found so far in SIN. You can choose between small / medium portions. Actually three restaurants next to each other so you are able to find a spot. Street construction ongoing so you better eat inside. Take away possible.

Finding delicious thai food in Singapore has proved to be quite the challenge. Zenso has one of my favorite green curries so far, and their soups have never disappointed us. Very reasonably priced for a quality meal!
5
It has been a favourite place of mine in Singapore. Infact a dinner at Zenso is most satisfying for me. Though the place is small but the taste of food is awesome.They have lots of vegetarian options and service is very good. Singapore trip is incomplete without dining at Zenso. Love the Pad Thai noodles here

My wife and I stopped to have lunch at this place on out to Orchard Rd. Good selection of $7 meals for lunch...we tried chicken and cashew nuts, chilli chicken and the bento box. Meals were good value for the flavours and size, service was good (though we had to wait about 15 mins, but they informed us at the outset about the wait time). Wouldn't go out of my way to hunt this place down but worth a visit if you're close by and looking for a good value lunch

Me and my bf love Thai food but we often face problems getting vegetarian Thai food, worse is when we get plain soup with random leaves n occasional meat pieces in our food. This place is awesome, it does justice to the vegetarian versions of their dishes n the taste is not at all compromised (I can tell as I use to be non-vegetarian and tried the NV versions before). The feel of the place is quiet chilled out too. Drinks are good n the prices are a steal (as its located near a Uni and has a huge student customer base). I would highly recommend this place

Really nice shop on Bencoolen near Middle road with quite a following of young office workers at lunchtime. I was lucky enough to snag a small table indoors on this hot steamy Friday. Alfresco is an option. I was able to walk here from the Intercontinental hotel in 10 mins tops. The menu is a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Japanese. The lunch special was a crazy 6.90 Sing (about 4.90 usd today) and most of the young office workers seemed to be doing just that. I had too much of an appetite for only that today, so I ordered off the ala carte menu where there were plenty of veg options for yours truly. I selected kai lan with garlic sauce, black olive fried rice and tofu with bean sprouts which was just enough. I didn't find any of the options crazy spicy (like Thai Express!) and the olive rice might even be described as plain tasting albeit delicious. Next time I'll add some chili and soy sauce me thinks.In any event the entire bill came to 24 Sing including my lime juice. A very nice bargain all in all. I'd say a non-ravenous couple could eat here for well under what I paid for my massive lunch samplings. I asked the owner how long she had been in business there and she indicated 5 years. I'll be back. --Enjo

Restaurant with asian, Japanese food. Tastes excellent. I love the spicy salads. Fresh, tasty food. If you like spicy take the mango salad. You can also ask for less spicy. They have also offersIn the form of rice sets or combination sets including a softdrink. Popular with young people. Very good value for your miney

Being vegetarian is not a crime but coming to this place they make u feel like it is ! They are rude and snap at u like ure a dumb .. I was so offended with this behaviour that didn't feel like eating here.
5

Having just arrived in Singapore that evening and looking for somewhere to eat near our hotel in Bencoolen Street we stopped in at Zenso.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and made a fuss of our tired children, which they loved. Service was quick and the food was very good and excellent value. We had some Bento boxes with katsu chicken and some spring rolls.Well worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a quick, casual bite to eat

My family and i went to the Bencoolen outlet for dinner and were seated outside. As there was some seating inside the restaurant with fans, we decided to change (we have not even ordered yet). I went to inform one of the staffs (a very tanned chubby guy) if its possible to move inside as it was quite humid outside. He rudely told me that there was no seating inside, despite there were. He was just too lazy to put them together for us (there are 4 of us). He snapped at me and said that this is SIngapore, so bear with the heat. Come on, i know Singapore is a tropical country but we can find lots of other places with air conditioning. Even the trains and buses in Singapore are with air conditioning. It is really unprofessional to give such a remarks to customer, as if we are trash and stupid!!!. I hope the management here could train their staffs for a better manners and attitude. I don't think this place can go any further hiring such staff, no matter how tasty the food!

Zenso is a comfortable and cozy cafe with a good variety of Thai food. The food is served with sufficient efficiency and while the staff tends to be rude sometimes, the affordability and taste of the food more or less compensates for this discrepancy in service quality.If you are around the area and looking for some tasty and warm thai food, I would surely recommend this place :

Food is average. They serve their own specialities, thai and japanese cuisine. Waiting time for food is short. Food comes in warm but the taste is average. Personally, i find that their pandan wrapped chicken is overcooked and the meat is too tough. On general, it is somewhere you can go to have a decent meal witg friends. Pricing is reasonable and they do not charge service charges

Just had dinner there . The staff makes you feel as if you have committed a crime by asking for a menu or by asking for an additional item after the order has been placed. Will never visit again and advise vegetarians to avoid as well as the staff is quite rude if you want to tell them no meat no eggs

Ate here twice and was very happy both times! Some of the dishes can leave you crying with the spiciness though! The is a great variety of dishes and the ones we tried were absolutely delicious as were the juices. The staff were really friendly and the place is clean. Prices are great and range from S$4.90 to about S$7.90 (the ones we ate). The servings make the cost really worth it
