Terrible the restaurant had closed down and yet they allowed us to make the reservation online .. a wasted trip down
4
Great quality of seafood in a bag, loved especially the mom's pasta which would have been a favourite if the quantity of pasta was increased. Curry flavoured seafood was especially good as well.
1
Bought the Fave vouchers for Crab in the Bag on Dec 30 and made reservation for Fri 5 Jan. When we reached there, it was closed cos the landlord has repossessed the unit
4
Nice food over a superb view!
Love how everyone eats in with their hands and no phones on the table!
4
The food there is excellent the service there is good . It was our first time there and the waitress there explain to us the menu very clearly and very patiently. Will visit again next time
3
Food was ok but it would be better if they include condiments like potato and corn like in dancing craps
3
Portion was small but the ambience was good! The Flavours are good and have a lot of variety as well!
4
Love the lobsters. Mussels were good too but clams can be improved. In our bag, there were at least 6 or more clams that werent open. Shd have gone for the prawns that looked more popular. Decent pricing with some merchant's discount.
4
Really fresh seafood and great service by the crew! The waitress who attended to us is very friendly and attended to us in a fun way
1
It was very bad experience as I brought 2 oversea friends to the restaurant last sat it was closed for business. I booked it online more than 1 week ago n have confirmation on reservation on 13/1. But we could not get hold the line to double confirm n left voicemail no one answer.
4
Seafood is fresh, love the sauces! Had the fries, sweet potato fries, and squid bites as sides which were great! A tad pricey though, but overall great experience!
5
Enjoyed good quality food and experienced great service, atmosphere was great for enjoying a meal and catch up session with friends.
5
love it, its a great experience with good view of Singapore night lights and the seafood are very fresh.
5
Crab in da bag has managed to perfect their sauces and the various different sauces blends perfectly well with their seafood (ask the staff to recommend which sauce would go best with which seafood) !:)
4
The seafood is fresh and taste good. A very quiet place for gathering. Enjoy the view from the restaurant as well as the bay. Price is a bit expensive.
5
Very unique experience...the way the food is served... thoroughly enjoy it...great seafood nice ambience at a reasonable price..
3
Food was okay only. but i have to compliment the crabs as they were meaty and fresh. Crayfish wasnt available and was replaced with some terrible small "lobster" lookalike. Drinks were pretty expensive and the GST + service charge hit up to $80. Overall spend $500+ for 8 pax and wasnt full. shocked to that price. probably trying this the first and last time. good experience though
3
My wife and I decided to try Crab in a Bag for dinner. The restaurant is nicely decorated with a nautical theme, and the menu pretty good. The concept is they cook your choice of seafood and sauce combination in a bag and serve it direct on the table for shared eating. Pretty cool and fun - and to be fair the food was pretty good. Kids seem to really like it.Our experience was spoiled by the service provided. Maybe it was an off night, but the staff were not smiling and did not seem happy in their work. That attitude communicates itself to customers and we certainly did not feel any love, or particularly welcome there.However, don't let my experience put you off - try for yourself and hopefully you will be there on a good day!
5
I went to Crab in Da Bag with family and friends. This restaurant is located close to Stadium and with a view of the river. It was a nice atmosphere and we had a lot of fun as the food is served in a bag or throw on the table, when you order the Titanic. If you are in a large group, I recommend to order several prawns or mussels with different sauces. Really exquisite!
4
I was very glad that my mum enjoyed the food, especially, the prawns in the curry 'sauce'.I had never seen her enjoying her food so much!! The only setback was the crabs weren't chopped up into more manageable pieces.Understand that it could be due to the overwhelming number of customers that night,but still .... Anyway, WE'll be back! :
4
Food was good, pity the pasta came in really small portions despite the price. Food was more expensive compared to other brands.
4
Food so so but love the ambience and the view. Would be great if they offer more variety of packages n nice desserts!
3
There to celebrate a fren's b'day. Some of the seafood is not that fresh. Overall ok ad staff are friendly.
4
Food and sauce was yummy and place was cosy and nice. Great sunset viewed from inside the restaurant.
5
Staffs were friendly. Good recommendation to us on the combination of the foods and sauces from the staff. Ambience was fantastic too cosy environment. Highly recommended to all. Thumbs up n keep up the good work!
4
Great food in a great location! Service was quick and very good. Ambience was perfect. Good view outside the restaurant.
4
Superbly flavoured prawns and crab ... not crowded so no worries for any queue .. there's also spaghetti for the kids
3
The place is nicely decorated and family friendly. However, service is poor. Waiters, more than one, choose to acknowledge our waving hands from far but did not come to our table until the third time. I have informed that we do not take spicy food but the waiter insist to recommend the north malaysian curry sauce for our squid. After much persuasion from him that it will not be spicy because chilli padi will not be added, we took it up. However, when the dish arrived, it was indeed too spicy for my friend. It is not mild at all. Ended up, my friend could not take the dish after 1st mouthful. What a waste! We should have sticked to what we wanted to order initially and not listen to the waiter's recommendation. He was very persistent
5
We have 3 adults and 3 children. It was wonderful, as the staff explained to us the process of ordering food. Even though, they were very busy with many requests from other customers, they still helped us with introducing the dishes, gave us extra cutlery due to the baby grabbing and throwing things, as well as helping to take photographs
4
1. The scenery, to start with, was good. i can see the evening sun setting in the west.2. I ordered from the ala carte section and the crabs & prawn seems like freshly caught!3. The lemonade size is kids size, sad to say. they need to give a bigger-sized cup for that.4. The cauliflower tasted oily in mouth. i have to dip it in the mayo sauce before putting it into my mouth.5. Overall experience is great, not excellent. that explains the 4 stars
4
Weekend dinner slow service but staff was courteous. Food was fresh and able to customise different flavours for different bags of seafood. Salted egg sauce was the best!
5
Fast / efficient service staff , always provide good recommendations. Exxcept yubbies always out of stocks too early !
5
The staff are very friendly. They overheard that it was my birthdae and made it a point to serve the dessert with candles along with birthdae song and appearance if crabie (their mascot). Really made my day!!!
5
Staff is friendly. Food is nice. Dun b afriad of dirting your hands xause there is place for u to wash.
4
The setting of the restuarant is at a nice place, especially at night, where we face the kallang river. The staff gives us good recommendation on the accompanying sauces. However, the food can be less salty, and it will be better.
5
Food is good, staff there recommendation is awesome, ambiance is great. Will definitely go back to enjoy the sumptuous meal
5
The foods were amazing. If the crowd gets busy, stretch your patience to the staff as their hands are full. So may not be able to attend to your needs immediately. The view is great while you eat. Takes your stress away & relaxes your senses. The place is pretty deep in for some people who are not familiar with the vicinity, so you might end up going around finding for the place. It's better to ask instead. Even some cab drivers are not too familiar with the place as there is no drop off point right in front of the restaurant. So be prepared to walk quite a fair bit distance to get there. Overall, foods were great
5
This gathering was meant to be ab adavance birthday celebration for friends. Crab in da bag surprise het with a crab mascot with the cake we prepared. She was so happy. This was my return visit to the store. They never failed to satisfy us with the food and service
5
Visited Crab in da Bag at Sports Hub recently for Mothers' Day dinner. We ordered the Titanic Pot recommended for 4 pax, food was served in a timely manner, the staff there were friendly and patiently did a introduction of the menu for us since its our first visit. The seafood were fresh and we all love it
5
I went there last Sat with a group of friends. We all love the affordability and fresh seafood served here, especially the prawns and mussels. And it's not over-crowded like most restaurants will be on weekends. The service crew are attentive to us as well. Highly recommend this place and my friends and I already had plans to go back again soon
5
The seafood were so fresh and the ambience was great too. The owner was very friendly and prepared a surprise when i told her it was my birthday.
3
The prawns in curry flavour were delicious, however, the crab was not as fresh as the prawns and it was turned cold too quickly before we can enjoy the salted egg flavoured crab properly.
5
a little difficult to find and out of the way, but if you are looking for somewhere chill and not too crowded with a nice view and decent food, this is the place to go.
5
Was served by a Malay waiter and I must compliment him to have provided an excellent experiment for me and my friends from China. He was prompt to alert us that during order of food that the crab avail that day isn't impressive in size, very good initiative made
4
The environment is conducive for gatherings and the music they played are the oldies which I like to. The food is good and the way the serve the food, the way we eat it is different from the usual way we have our meals. The scenic waterfront view tops up the dinning experience even more
5
Enjoyed my first crab in da bag experience totally with 2 bags of crayfish! 1 in the must try salty splash mix while the other in the signature caboodle mix. Personally love the salted egg mix, which went really well with the herbs and spices, that I dipped the remaining sauce with my sweet potato fries
3
We were at crab in da bag last weekend , even though their menu is limited it looked interesting.My kids were amazed by the way they served their seafood, it was literally poured on the table and we were supposed to pick and eat .It was just different.They have perfect view of Singapore CBD and skyline , but walking to the restaurant is a bit of challenge , it's quite deep in , and we found it after going through a few turns.
3
The staff did not made effort for the birthday event, even though it was not so crowded; and we wrote in our booking about it too as well as the seating location. When placing the initial order the staff had an expression which looked as if she was not so interested in servicing us. It was a huge difference compared to the Big Splash branch. The staff was great and we really had a special time over there - twice
4
Location is really obscure, unless you know the area well, it's really hard to find. Took us close to 30mins to finally get there. Having said that, seafood was really fresh and tasty. Condiments that came with the seafood bag were also yummy. But price was a bit on the high side and think the restaurant was under staffed.
3
Went to the one in sports hub. Had a hard time finding the place! It's a stand alone shop outside the mall and from the mall, there was hardly any sign indicating where it was. We had 4 bags of crayfish. Crayfish was fresh, sauce was nice. A bit on the pricey side
4
Prawns are veey big and fresh. Crayfish is small and not as good as the prawns. Salted egg sauce was our favourite, best salted egg prawns I have tasted so far.
4
Nice and succulent mussels, crabs. :) TOo bad portions are abit small. Am keen to try to boston lobster next time
4
It was our first time trying crab in da bag. I must say it was a pleasant experience. Although on the pricey side, the food was great. One of the server named Tinesh even offered to help cut the lobster upon request.
3
Had a unpleasant experience with the payment. The food was not bad though. Without the voucher it will be expensive.
3
The ambience is good but I personally feel that food is over-priced even with the one for one, imagine if there is not one-for-one, definitely not a go-go then! Me and my hubby had tummy ache after dinner too!
5
good and easy reservations applications u can Enjoy your seafood fuss free , finger licking good and relax setting . Promotion are value for money
4
1 for 1 deal was worth it! The salty splash sauce was so good! Would love it if there are other ingredients in the bag other than just crayfish.
4
It was our second visit to the outlet at Stadium Walk within 2 weeks and we thoroughly enjoyed the delicious prawns and squid. Both dishes were cooked perfectly. The view outside the restaurant is also very nice. Great place to visit in the evening.
5
Good ambience for a meal out with friends or lovers at night. Has a view of the surrounding vast water area. Food was abit pricy, but well worth paying for the view.
1
Our friends brought us to this resturant, to our horror, EVERY dish was packed in large disposable plastic bag for one time use. OMG! Could the Ministry of Environment please look into this ill practice? Plastic bags are harmful for both the environment and human! When hot food is packed in plastic bag, chemical like polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and polystyrene would emit onto our food, killing us slowly. That is why no other restaurant is operating in this manner. Food taste is fine, and they could definitely make it without the plastic bags. Pricing is high for casual dining. $40++ per head for light meal
3
So So la
That was my experience at crab in the bag. Food was okay but expensive with so many restrictions as to choice.
3
There was some hiccup in the kitchen but a lady (likely the boss) offered complimentary bites to keep our appetites going. Good service attitude and despite the delay, we enjoyed the prawns (1-for-1 Chope Exclusive) which were big and juicy.
4
Even though there seems to be shortage of manpower, the customer service level is great. Recommendations to the different sauces with the different food is perfect. :)
5
love the food fresh and all the flavour really nice.friendly staff thumbs up for the good service and will come again!
4
We had salted egg prawns and fragrant curry crayfish. All well marinated with aromatic spices like curry leaves, and chilli padi. Very different take from the usual chilli and black pepper versions. Wish we had tried the other flavors too, Also had the sweet potato fries and the wings. All yummalicious. Service was exceptionally good. Prices were fai
5
Food is good, price is good! Ambience is fantastic! Prep to wait about 30mins for the food though! I feel that Sri Lakan Crab is a must order, its worthy! Not too pricey and is enough for 2 pax. Prawns are fresh! If its your first time there, let the staff recommend the seasoning
4
Good food and accommodating management who allowed use of the Chope voucher with 1 for 1 deal even though the offers could not be used together. (Chope should have specifically warn upfront and in BOLD that vouchers could not be used with the 1 for 1 promo with which the reservation was made under.) Chingay Parade fireworks was a great bonus
4
Interesting ways of presenting the food. The pasta in the bag tastes very good - medium spicy is enough since it's chili padi.It was an experience to eat from the table (albeit with plastic sheet). Price is quite steep. About $150 for 2 pax.Quite empty on a Sat afternoon
3
The overall ambience of the place was very charming with a nautical theme. I was greeted at the door after several minutes of waiting, by a very friendly lady. The waitstaff are very friendly. However, my issue with the place was that I wasn't told that it would be a 45 min wait for the food. So we just waited and waited. On top of that there were issues with the kitchen . Once they realised how long we (and other tables) had waited, they were very apologetic and gave us some carrot and cucumber sticks and dip to munch on while we waited for our food. The restaurant manager did come up to our table and apologise profusely for the wait and gave us options. In the end, we did wait for the food because, it did sound incredibly delicious. The food itself was alright. I loved the idea behind the food, but the execution wasn't great. But I did still eat everything up quite happily. This restaurant has a lot of potential and they really did try their best to make up for the wait. Additionally, I would actually go back and try again because I am hopeful that it was just a bad night which happens to the best of us.
3
While the prawns serving was acceptable and tasted great, the pasta was small as if it were for kids. The mussels serving was too small to justify its hefty price tag. Pitas were served warm but $3 for 3-halves? We ordered a $4 hot lemongrass (thinking that it was homebrew) but it was just a teabag in a styrofoam of hot water
5
It's a great experience eating with your hands freely. Food was served in plastic bags instead of plates. Seafood was fresh and tasty !
5
The food was good, customer service was even better! I'm definitely going back for more! The only thing was the location of the restaurant. For first timers it might be hard to locate. More signage will be :)
5
Food good Servers good Everything was perfect But bit expensive to eat costs 300 sg dollars to eat for 4family
4
Great taste and great fun. It's messy as they serve it in a bag as the name suggests but spread a plastic cloth on the table and give you bibs. Nice choice of seafood not just crab and different sauces and spice levels to choose.
5
Enjoyed the boiled seafood pot. My guests who were from hk, japan and london were very impressed with the good quality of food. They totally enjoyed it.
2
Service is good. Fries and prawns are good. However, the sauce used is not strong enough and neither is the spiciness although we ordered medium. Crab does not have the sweet taste.
4
Thank you, the food is still good and the services are good too. Found that the crab is a bit smaller, the prawns are very fresh and sweet. Yummy overall. Will be better if the price can be lower.
5
very excellent! They provide very good serivces for our dinner. We enjoy our dinner there.
We will recommend our friends.
3
The ambient was nice and secluded from the city. Place was quiet with no crowd during the weekday. However, there was a lizard feacal on the corner of our table. The server saw and did not offer us another seating when the restaurant was so empty. Again, he laid the table sheet on TOP of it, showing no intention to clean it or offer the change of seating. Food was so so. Would prefer to go Dancing crab instead.
5
Completely enjoyed the experience at Crab In Da Bag. Staff were very friendly, and assisted with the birthday surprise for a friend. They even brought out a crab mascot to celebrate! Food quality was excellent, and the restaurant boasts a great view of city skyline. Great to visit during sunset hours. Not crowded at all on a weekday night, so it's perfect for a quiet dinner. Food is slightly pricey, but for the service and ambience it was all worth it.
5
The food was great with flavorful seasonings.
The seafood was very fresh.
The staff was responsive and attentive with great recommendations.
4
The service staff were very helpful and patient when recommending sauce pairings and food choices. The standard portion of prawn (in house special sauce) was quite good.
4
Great dining experience, good food, excellent service in a nicely decorated environment. If the music can be softened then all is perfect.
5
This was my second visit. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the dishes and helped us choose our menu. All the staff were patient, attentive and friendly. Food was excellent. Its not cheap but good value for the ambience, taste and excellent service.
5
Very enjoyable service with my family ! Seafood were superb fresh ! However too expensive . Will definitely recommend friend to try once :)
2
Food took forever to arrive. Could understand if there was a slight delay if it was very crowded but there was still no excuse why a linguine would take 1 hour and 20 minute to arrive. Staff kept assuring us that it was "coming". Also, it was busy but yet the staff can use their phones behind the bar while we tried to get their attention for service. We were at the big splash outlet the night before and service and food were excellent. We will try to avoid this outlet if possible in the future.
4
My first crab in da bag, and it was a messy affair! I like the Salted Egg Prawns best, and the Curry Clams! Location wise, it was not easy to find, but the signs place outside Kallang Wave mall helps ;) The ambience of the restaurant feels very inviting, I guess it was largely due to the friendly service staff :)
5
My family had a wonderful dinner at your place. For once, my family had a great time 'messing up' with our hands while we enjoyed the food. This is something generally not permissible during normal dinner time. My children proudly took pictures of the great mess at the end of the diinner
4
Something new and unique experience where you have to eat with your hands, in fact, crab can only be enjoyed when you eat them in your hands.We ordered spicy curried cab and it was done really well. Right mixture of spices and oil (yes it's bit oily when you order this one) and taste wise it was perfect. Service was good and prompt so it does make the over all experience better. 1) better food2) good service3) good ambience 4) moderately priced
4
It was weird indeed as I couldn't think for a moment how we could manage to eat without any plates or forks or knives. But it was an unusual experience!The seafood was fresh and the sauces were interesting - except for my great aunt who was taken aback by eating off the table. All in all we had a nice time. The staff were helpful and attentive. We'll definitely be back again
5
Best place to dine so far. Good view, extremely friendly staff, delicious food, worth the money and experience.
4
It's a nice and quiet place for double date. Seafood is fresh and nicely done though not fabulous. A bit pricey compared to other restaurant with the same concept of serving seafood from a bag/bucket pouring into the table.
3
The outlet at Kallang is not easily accessible and is a challenge for the elderly to walk from the nearest car park.
4
Would definitely go back there again. Staff was warm and friendly. Nothing bad to pick on.Pls keep the good work up guys
3
There should be more varieties of drinks ( cold and hot) on the menu .
Chairs should be cushioned and standardized .
5
Price is on higher side but definitely worth it with the nice decoration and responsive staff. Food was great ! I ordered crab in the original butter and garlic sauce. Can totally taste the sweetness of crab!
4
Loved the music. Gave the place a retro-ish vibe. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. Helped to explain the menu to the elderly folk and came to check up on us during our meal.
3
The set meal comes with most of the seafood like crab, yabbies, crayfish, clams, squid, potatoes, corn and hot-dog.
4
Service - good ! Waiter are very attentive and service is good and fast. Explains to us about certain seafood is better with certain sauce etc to make sure we enjoy the food.We ordered a crab, tiger prawn and clams and is just nice for 4 people. Love all the 3 sauces we tried and after eating already thought of going back
2
This is the 4th Louisiana seafood concept restaurant I have been. Unfortunately it had disappointed me beyond my expectations. To be fair, I did come with certain expectations since I have some comparison in mind. It got to be better than Dancing crab, the Boiler, or the Cajun King... If not at least match up. The reason why it was not the best but rather the worst of the few I have named is simply because the seafood bag combo do not come with the sauce, be it house mix or butter garlic. Instead it comes with side dips. The bag of seafood came in plain like it was just parboiled. Although the waiter was trying to explain the original boiler concept is such, I cannot understand the rationale of why it comes as plain with side dips if you order combo bag but it comes with sauce if you order ala carte seafood. As a consumer it does not make sense. Even the waiter can't explain properly. We ordered the crab seafood bag which cost $99. The clams and prawns are fresh but not the Sri Lanka crab. The fresh was all mushy and not firm. The size of the crab was considerably smaller than expected too. It was also funny when we saw huge uncut onion and potatoes in the bag. How are we supposed to eat them? Weird! Compare to dancing crab the varieties are limited as they do not serve the popular Louisiana fried chicken and waffles. Their drink menu is expensive too. Imagine the seafood is already so expensive and they capitalized further by charging 4.50 for a Coke and 5 for lemonade. Skip the mums chicken wings, it's all bones. The mums pasta is not too bad but the portion of noodles is extremely little and I wonder if it is even meant for 1 person portion. I would have given 1 star if not because the waiters and waitresses were all trying hard to be nice. Sorry but I won't be back for sure. I will visit the other 3 options for my seafood in da bag fixed, and am sure it is more satisfying with the sauce mixed together in full flavor than to have the dip separately. The boss of CIDB should really take into consideration this feedback if they really want to be an edge above the competition.
