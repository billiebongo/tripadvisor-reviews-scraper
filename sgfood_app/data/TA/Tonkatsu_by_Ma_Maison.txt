The restaurant serves very tender and juicy pork cutlet (tonkatsu), all meals come wth free flow of miso soup, premium Japanese rice and cabbage salad. Value for money.

The Momorio Pork is advertised as the Pink Pork from Japan. It has a unique texture and is wonderful. The deep fried Oysters (also from Japan) were plump and flavoursome. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
4
They have really interesting Tonkatsu here, including ones made from Iberico pork. The cold tofu and potato salad sides were really yummy as well.
5
Have been here multiple times. Hadn't failed me before. Food (esp. the pork) is constantly good. Love the unlimited refill of cabbage and miso soup. Absolutely worth the price.
5
Excellent as always! Kurobota was Fantastic! Service was very good. Mel’s were out pretty quickly. A favorite of mine in Singapore.

Deep fried and crispy pork meat, prawns and fish accompanied with salads, pickled reddish and a variety of sauces. A delicious treat!

My girlfriend and I are regulars here at Ma Maison and we order the same dishes every time we dine.I ordered robu katsu and prawn while my gf ordered the katsu curry and always requests curry sauce on the side.But this time, they forgot to put the sauce aside. We called the attention of our server and showed him the sauce and he responded right away to take out the sauce. When the manager took notice on this, he approached us and asked us if they can just take out the sauce, change the plate and use the same katsu. My gf disagreed and told him we are willing to wait for a new one.About another 7-10 minutes of wait, the new order of katsu with the sauce aside arrived on the table. But this time another problem occurred. It was too obvious they just re-fried the meat as we can see the plate is too oily, and some pork cutlets are undercooked. We can say it’s undercooked as we can see reddish color on the cutlets. We called again their attention and asked if they can recook the meat. But the manager refuses and insisted their pork or all their meat were well done. Again, we are regulars here and can say it’s not well done. He’s kinda rude, and my gf lost appetite. He’s even telling his staff to void the order and take it out on our bill, wherein everyone in the restaurant can hear his voice. This is not how to deal complaints

It was a long queue during dinner time on weekend, fortunately we visited at around 6pm and managed to get a table for 6 (seated outside) without any queue.Their menu is pretty extensive and has a variety of selections, making one spoilt for choices. Personally think that the Tonkatsu is not bad and the restaurant provides free flow of rice, miso soup and salad. Their service is really great too, with service staff checking on our table for about 3 times during the meal. Will be back again next time

I’ve been here several times years ago and decided to come back with my mom and brother. This is their favorite restaurant and staying in the mandarin, it’s very conveniently located!First time I ate here I ordered the kurobota katsu while my mom ordered the special Iberico. I wanted the iberico but as they have limited servings I ended up getting the kurobota which I loved! The taste is very succulent and rich yet not overpowering or oily. We also wanted to order their monthly special of truffle katsu but was out of stock by the time it was dinner time. Ate here again for early dinner at 5pm as I had a flight to catch and was able to order the truffle katsu. Was divine and a must try! I must say have been treated well every time I eat here. Staff work hard! See you guys again

We went to Tonkatsu Ma Maison in Mandarin Gallery Orchard.We ordered their signature Kurobuta Pork, Spanish Black Pig and Mentaiko Mille Fuelle Katsu, everything was on point but there is one thing that makes me want to reveiw this place ASAP. Her name is Peggy, she was the one that took care of our table, from the start she took our order patiently and in fact gave us suggestions and gave us explanations that lead us to ordering the right thing. She Served us from the heart for sure, and if one day i owned a restaurant i want all my crew learn from her. Thanks Peggy.

This little restaurant in the Mandarin Gallery delivered exactly what we felt like. The Memoir and Prawns sets were very good, and the service was attentive.
5
Awesome dishes and the beefs are well cooked with reasonable prices. Environment was pleasant and unique with a bit of romance:) Service was well. Nice place for couples.
5
The pork was really good and tender. tasty and one of the best tonkatsu you can get in singapore. comparable to japan.
4
First time trying out the food at this place and loved the quality of the food! The staff were attentive as well. Reasonably priced food items for the experience that comes along with it.
5
Plenty to like about this charming little eatery / restaurant. Three of us attended for dinner and found it an easy and relaxing dining experience. The service was attentive and provided guidance on which sauces to use etc. The black pork was very cool and enjoyed by all, but for me the highlights were the side dishes including the tuna and potato salad were awesome. The Katsu Don - a laborer staple was delicious and well balanced with egg and onion. Several beers on tap and a really yummy black bali tea made for a memorable experience and a place I would return to again with out hesitation
4
So i am not a huge fan of fried food, i like katsu but never tried the pork ones as I don't eat pork that much. But i tried this one as my cousin recommended me. It was good. It was crispy but doesn't feel heavy, the meat was tender. I ordered the rosu with additional radish, and the package was really fulfilling. It cost around $20++ where u got the rice, tonkatsu, salad, soup and some jelly as deserts and some pickle. And for that taste i think it is okay. We had another radish dish for appetizer it was also good, and we ordered the spicy mentai or whatever that comes with seaweed and u can eat with radish; it is also good. The free complementary tea is very fragrant and nice. You may try this rest. It is in orchard, mandari

I went to tonkatsu Ma Maison with my family of 4 kids and 3 adults today. When I was ordering from the waitress, I asked about their free refillable rice and cabbage policy and was told it will have to depend on how much I order. So I proceed to order 4 sets of pork cutlet and 3 side dishes. When I requested for 2 bowl of their so call refillable rice after we have finished ours, I was being told that there is not enough rice for refill. To the management of tonkatsu Ma Maison: please review your free refillable policy if you are so unwilling to refill for customer. (Note: my kids age are 2, 4, 6 & 8) so if every single customer have to order each set please indicate. Thanks
4
Restaurant is in Mandarin Galleries and we were accommodated just before closing so we had to rush our orders. Tonkatsu and cabbage salad were perfectly prepared and the breaded oysters were so juicy and sumptuous. The staff were very courteous and patient inspite of us being the last customers. Service was great
5
Nice ambience, that takes you back to the old days. The Jazz music and the western japanese decor sets the mood up. The pork cutlet, almost perfectly done, served hot to you. with free refills for soup rice and lettuce, you will definitely eat till you are full
5
The pork was so well made, they were excellent and superior compared to other tonkatsu restaurants. A recommendation would be the Black Kurobota Pork. It was extremely juicy as well as tender. The exterior was fried to perfection as well.Add on to that, a free flow of miso, cabbage and rice were all available
4
The food is delicious, me & my friend ordered two from three main dish of tonkatsu menu , the taste is yummy & the staff is nice too
5
The tonkatsu here is very very juicy with nice sauce, well-cooked rice and refillable veggies. The service is great too.
3
First came to this joint 3 years ago and absolutely love the tonkatsu. This time round, i purposely came back to eat again but was very disappointed that the quality of the food as so unlike the ones i had 3 years ago.
3
Sadly, this is already the best Tonkatsu I could find in Singapore. I have tried almost all recommendations I could find online. The food is just alright, nothing really extra special though.
4
Came here for dinner with the family. Amazing tonkatsu, and bottomless cabbage salad. Can't say the same with the service. The waiter seems like to rush people to order food. Kinda reluctant to answer questions. Unfortunate for a restaurant that serve very good food.
5
We were tried new menu, Tonkatsu with Truffle . Taste was superb, serving was with the truffle salt only for dipping. Meat is tender and juicy on inside and crunchy outside. Perfectly fried. We shared this meal, so we didn't have the free flow rice and salad.
5
Just finished lunch a few hours ago at Tonkatsu by Ma Maison in Mandarin Gallery Orchard Road. The place is popular because the food is good. Frequented by Japanese families living in Singapore. Recommend the Jumbo Rosu Katsu Set which wasn't really that large but sufficient to satisfy tonkatsu cravings. Better than Katsukura at Takashimaya in Shinjuku
5
I went to singapore regularly (around 5 to 7 times a year) and I never skip this place. The pork katsu is so tender, juicy, thick and crispy. The miso soup is one of the best that I ever tried, the tea jelly at the end is so refreshing and I feel so completed after i finished my meal. Its a simple comfort meal that will exceed your expectation.
2
Find it really nothing special. Don't understand why there is always a queue for it. Perhaps I do not know how to enjoy the pork cutlet? Serving staffs were attentive. Serve the dessert upon you finishing your dishes.There was this "seem to be manager" who always rise his voice across the restaurant to attend to his customers, in a quick sudden manner. He did that beside me..and it gave me a shock. Don't find it nice and it's rather expensive. $25++ for a cutlet set
3
This is my regular place for Tonkatsu since 6 years ago and has been my one of my favourite place (used to come here almost every week) but agree with the others that quality has been dropping for the past 2-3 years and sadly there are no other better alternative. Try to ask for the more juicy part when you order.
4
The staff are friendly & courteous. There was a long queue and there's one staff who kept updating & assuring us that we will be given a seat asap. That's great service!!
Ordered cheesy tonkatsu, the pork was so tender, crispy and juicy.
5
Such awesome tonkatsu, juicy and crispy. Free flow of rice, miso soup and cabbage too. Ambience was good too, although be prepared to go early or queue up.
5
Different kind of Tonkatsu. Basically they stacked up thin layers of pork and deed fried them. The sliced cabbage that company the tonkatsu also very nice. The waiter even refill them for me. Definitely coming back here.
5
Incredible tonkatsu. Great miso soup with the set. And nice crispy salad. Excellent service too. The seats are comfortable . Make sure to come early as a queue forms fast. This is best tonkatsu in Singapore.
5
I love the tonkatsu , the cabbage and goma dressing! The tonkatsu sauce had the right blend of sour, sweet, salty and the nutty flavor of sesame seeds, I would definitely go back for more of this melt in your mouth crunchy pork loin anytime!
1
I came in group of 4 girlfriends around 3 pm. Most of the table were still occupied by people, so we have to wait in the provided queuing area. After we got a table, one of the staff came and gave us a bit of explanation about the menu and the special of the day. Because we only want to try this place that so-called-hip-of-the-town right now, we thought to order just 1 or 2 dishes and shared it together. We came for short holiday to Singapore so we want to save some spaces and eat other local dishes. Then another staff came to take our order. We decided to only order the premium black pork because it's come in set with rice, we were afraid if we order another set we would get too full. Then came the other guy which we thought the manager of the place that is SO RUDE! He came to our table and said "If you want to have a light bite just go to the Antoinette (which is the next door small cafe, because usually in a restaurant there is minimum order that is two dishes." This is the first time that I came to restaurant and get treatment like this. So I just reply " We want to try the tonkotsu" We ordered another a la carte the so-called Tonkotsu ma maison style with miso sauce and turned out it so blah! After all the tonkotsu just average, there is nothing special. And it is so freaking expensive $33.80 for a set meal that is not that big as well. If you happened to walked past by no need to try. Better go to other restaurant
3
Had a meal with my wife here on Friday at 6pm.The Staff and even the Managers were more intent on clearing tables and looking for a quick turnaround to handle the large crowd.Word of advice: please take care of your customers whom are seated and attend to them before you lpst more customers.1 word: Disgusted
4
Not the best katsu I have had in Singapore, but it was quite good. I found the batter not as fluffy/airy compared to what I have had. I am not an expert in tonkatsu though. Having it with ponzu sauce was a mistake. I should have stuck to miso sauce (like in Nagoya) or the katsu sauce (I like that they have spicy and sweet option). I love the sesame salad dressing and the multi rice options. Worth a try
5
I had visit westgate outlet, and the one at Mandarin Gallery. Both are great but Mandarin Gallery has better service. I usually have the Fatty version - Rosu, multi-grain rice, and plenty salad! If you prefer lean meat, choose Hire. Personal favourite is Wafu Negioroshi, the one with raddish mash and spring onion, naturally flavorful without the sauces they provide. I would much prefer Tonkatsu by Ma Maison than Tonkichi (Orchard Central) or Ginza Bairin (Ion). Reason for better value (refillable), tender pork, and the crispiness is just nice, not too hard
4
This restaurant is famous for their Tonkatsu. They have various to choose from the authentic type to fusion. The rice, shredded cabbage and miso soup is replenish-able. There are the usual white rice and brown rice , though i still like white rice, which is sweeter. They have the usual black pork meat and the usual one. There is also the fusion one where several layers of pork are sandwiched with cheese and fried to perfection. The tonkatsu were not oily but crisp. I still prefer their classic black pork.
5
I just totally love this place and I have not found better Tonkatsu -- even in Tokyo! The restaurant does get very busy -- particularly over the weekend -- so I would recommend arriving early.
4
Crisp and crunchy fried food. Never a taste of stale oil. I like the food although I find it a tad pricey.
5
Always go to this restaurant when i go to singapore.. Very good foods, good service and good location.. The price around 20-38sgd per portion..
4
Wanted to try tonkatsu so we ventured down here to try the pork. They had a promotion for Kagoshima rose pork but you have to scan the qr code or website to answer some basic questions. So we did n ordered 2 orders and beer to go with it and a side dish too. Pork was succulent and tasty but my wife found it abit fatty. Overall, it was tasty pork and service was good. Overall ambience was nice too.

Nearly everyone enjoys a tasty breaded pork cutlet which explains the frequent queues at this Ma Maison outlet. Some good things about this restaurant:1. It's comfort food for sure but well done in that the pork cutlet has a crispy outer layer, has a nice dry touch and doesn't smell of refried oil (This typically happens when restaurants don't change the oil in the deep fryer often enough - I can think of one tonkatsu restaurant in Ngee Ann city guilty of this). 2. You get to choose from a few cuts of meat - hire (fillet) or rosu (pork loin), the premium black pork or iberico pork when that's available.3. There is a good variety of set meals you can choose from which include a choice of white or brown rice, miso soup, pickles and refillable salad of shredded Japanese white cabbage (delicious!). 4. They also serve Japanese katsu curry (katsu served with rice and a mild (not spicy) n sweet tasting curry sauce) and katsu don (katsu on a bed of rice topped with on rice an egg and onion gravy).5. You get a choice of the standard condiments on the table - sweet and spicy sauces for the katsu, sesame salad dressing, ground sesame seeds that you can add to your sauce or salad. Some other things to note:There's a limited range of deep fried seafood - prawns and oysters.You don't get necessarily get the best grade of pork here but put in perspective, this is a casual dining restaurant, what they serve is tasty and a reasonable quality for the price (it's not cheap but hey, this is Singapore). Service can be uneven at times as over several visits, we can tell it's hard for them to hire full time servers. On our last visit, the team of three did a great job of attending to us (refilling our complimentary water and tea, getting us extra curry sauce and cabbage) though they were really stretched.So all things considered, we'd give this place the thumbs up and we'll keep coming back
4
We ordered 2 pork katsu.. one was the black pork katsu and another one is rosu katsu (less fat than the black pork)Actually i like the rosu katsu better, but they said the black pork was the favourite dish.Pork was crispy outside but still tender inside.You can add shoyu and salt to add some flavour to the meat.The dish was a bit pricey, about 33 sgd..The pork katsu served with brown rice, huge portion of cabbage salad, miso soup and small pudding.Portion was huge, if you usually eat in small portion, it can be eaten for 2 persons.I enjoyed my meal here
4
Awesome Tonkatsu. The way the prepared is a bit different compare to other restaurant. Service is quite good, except the waiter is a bit hurrying us to order. But he also explained in detail about the menu. During our meal, he came to our table and offer us more cabbage too. Btw that cabbage salad is simply awesome. Overall, I would definitely come back here
2
Food was quite good, especially the condiments provided on the table tops. However, service was really disappointing.Went with 2 other friends at about 8 plus in the night. Did not have to wait too long to get a table facing the chefs. #1) Staff kept asking whether we were ready to place our orders >3 times within 5 minutes after we got our menu. Although very proactive of them, but still quite unpleasant to be rushed to place an order. #2) Ordered a 160g Pork loin topped with raddish, but was served something different. Looked similar to what my friend ordered but smaller and without raddish. So I asked the waiter what's the difference. Was told that they are the same, just that one is 160g, and mine was 120g. Explained to him it was not what I ordered, and the manager approached and offered to serve the raddish and condiment on the side which was similar to what I ordered. Shortly after the manager walked to the kitchen, and checked with the chef if the separation of the raddish and condiments were the same (assured customer that it is the same when he does not know his items well)#3) Bill came, and item reflected was what I ordered, however, the price of the item was for 160g. (Note that the raddish-topped pork loin only comes in portions of 160g as shown in the menu). Asked the same waiter again and he explained that what I got was the 160g and not 120g. And went on explaining how the meat was presented to differentiate the difference in meat quantity. Totally trying to smoke his way through, and trying to twist his words. However, in order to reduce any poor distaste, I did not attempt to pursue the matter and just paid the bill.#4) While at the table taking out and counting our cash, waiter approached and asked if the payment was ready. I do not understand the rush in it. It was approximately 9.20pm but they seemed like they were rushing to close up everything.#5) When we exited, they nicely thanked us which was appreciative. But with one of the staff still munching on his food while on the floor, saying thank you. Very unpleasant dining experience for a Japanese restaurant
4
We frequent this outlet often for the cabbage and sesame sauce. It is second to none.Same goes for the soup. Not saying the tonkatsu is inferior. They are good and a variety to choose from. We like the layered version as it is tender and juicy.Service can be improved. Need additional helping hands to handle the a full house of diners. other than that, the service staff is friendly and helpful
3
Came here (to the new outlet in Capitol Piazza) for dinner last week and opted for the combined ramen and tonkatsu set, with some extra bamboo. Everything was decent enough, service was attentive, and the location quite nice. But I couldn't honestly say the quality of the food was such that it justifies another visit. Decent but I've had better
5
Black pork katsu in this restaurant is really amazing. Crispy, delicious and the portion is large. I promise i wanna back you eat you againn!!!
5
Went there for a late lunch at the outlet in Chijmes, the service was friendly and the food was superb. It was easily the best tonkatsu we've ever tried.
4
Decor n seating is sublime. An array of Japanese cuisine cooked to perfection. Not so quick service but the beer mugs on offer will while away the hunger. Preview of selected cuisine too kept on display.
3
Heard of this place for a while and decide to give it a try. Will say the kurobuta pork is ok but lack of flavour while I have taste better. It's a busy night which i can understand but service staff should let customer eat with ease and not rushing us in each aspect of their service
1
I heard good reviews about Ma Maison but only came to be disappointed. I think they were good but not anymore.They boast to be a specialty in Tonkatsu but seriously, I would rather go to sushi tei. I ordered the sirloin and tenderloin. The sirloin was so full of fats and even then, the pork is not juicy. It was very greasy. The tenderloin is not much different either. The pork is not juicy at all and worse, the cutting is a mess. I can't enjoy any dishes at all. No wonder there are no more queues here
2
Having first visited this restaurant three years ago when I was blown away with the food I returned on my latest visit to Singapore only to be very disappointed. The food was universally tasteless. The pork was nicely cooked but tasted of nothing in particular, the sweet and spicy sauces on the table didn't taste of much and didn't really taste much different. The shredded salad was the ultimate in bland and the staff forgot the order for a second drink halfway through the visit (and the restaurant was only half full so busy was not a reason).Would I go back. Certainly not as my first choice for Japanese food in Singapor
5
We were exploring Singapore, got hungry, and decided to follow some people who looked like they were heading off the sidewalk to a row of small restaurants for lunch. What a pleasant surprise. My pork Tonkatsu was really tasty along with the side dishes that came with it. Loved it
4
Dining alone while on business in Singapore, sat up at the bar in front of the kitchen and watched the theatre of the food prep before a splendid set menu of Kurobuta Pork Tonkatsu was presented to me. Fast and efficient service, couldn't fault the Tonkatsu hero. Good value @ S$33 for the set plus a frosty Sapporo to wash it down. Would go again
5
We had dinner at Tonkatsu last week and once again it was a delicious meal. We first found Tonkatsu back in May, earlier this year, when we were returning home from a cruise. We loved the meal so much that we returned on this visit and we weren't disappointed. We loved the Prawn entrÃ©e and the Pork main course. The Miso soup is great and I loved the shredded cabbage. The wonderful Japanese beer is a great accompaniment to the delicious food. We are looking forward to returning next year when we again visit Singapore
5
This place serves one of the best tonkatsu I've ever had. The meat was soft and fluffy while the breading on it is just nice. The free flow of miso soup, rice and cabbage is great as well, their miso soup is really nice. Service was fast and responsive as well, while the interior decor was not bad
5
Japanese food isn't only sushi and sashimi, and this restaurant proves it well! They only serve delicious regional food from Nagoya. I had the pan-fried pork steak with plum sauce and it was simply divine! Will definitely come back.
4
Succulent pork chops with crunchy texture outside. The cabbage certainly takes some of the greasy tastes associated with Japanese fried pork cutlet. Service was better than average Singaporean restaurants. Will likely to return if in the area.
5
Every time i travel to singapore, i have to eat this tonkutsu! My, it is by far the most delicious tonkutsu i have ever tasted. Cant ask for more... Well done. I wish there is tonkatsu by ma maison in indonesia (T.T)
5
it's all about compliments for this place. Love the food, the large fried prawn with tartare, particularly awesome !!! service crew great ... worth the money for the quality
4
If you ever missed the beautiful deep fried Japanese tonkatsu, then this is the place you must go to. I ordered the black pork without the fat, and it was still quite juicy and not too dry. The fried oyster is to die for if you are a fan of oyster and deep fried like me! Definitely my favourite Tonkatsu store in Singapore!
5
To say that this restaurant only does one dish is not true, but their specialty is the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet), which makes up most of the menu. It is delicious. The clincher for me is the delicious spicy mustard (I wish they would sell it by the bottle!).
5
This place really lives up to its reputation. They do Tonkatsu and they do it well (with free refills of salad, tea and brown rice). I tried the Kurobuta pork Tonkatsu and it was well worth the money! Succulent, moist, high quality and most importantly for me, it wasn't too greasy like other Tonkatsu meals. Easily one of the finest places to have Tonkatsu here in Singapore
5
I love Tonkatsu restaurants and I try them very often in different cities, and this one is one of the best if not the number one.There is particular care for the customer, for the ingredients and for the quality of food, you can really feel it. The quality of the meat is very high, even for the basic set. You can chose brown or normal rice, in unlimited refill as well as for the salad and tea. The sauces are very good. I manage to get here at least once every time I'm in Singapore
3
Tried this place for the second time, when I come to Singapore for business trips I normally stop nearby so it's within walking distance. The place is nice, good sevice and quite similar to a Tonkatsu-ya in Japan, food is not exactly cheap.I loved the miso, tsukemono, brown rice choice and all the sauces. Shame for the main thing, which is the tonkatsu, it wasn't all that great, quite dry despite me ordering the Kurobuta Hire which is meant to be the best pork that they have on offer.ALl in all I have had better, but it's a decent option if you are in the area and really want to eat Tonkatsu
5
The tonkatsu Ma Maison at Westgate is awesome. Great portions of tonkatsu, uber delicious, and solid sides. Unlimited salad makes for a good appetizer. Dressing is tasty. Soup that comes with meal is chock full of tasty ingredients. Sauces and powder are delectable. Oysters are brilliant. When the crowds come, don't expect stellar service. But hey it's Singapore so don't expect anything eh? A great experience. Seating is limited so try to go early or make a booking.
5
I have only positives to say about this restaurant. We visit it regularly and it is excellent every time. Superb Miso Hare Katsu with awesome Miso Soup and Rice. It's one of my favourite places to eat in town. Welldone and keep it up guys!
5
It's all about pork and i love it, the only thing bad about it is the long queue, we have to wait for almost an hour.
4
Don’t come here if deep fried food and pork are not your idea of great food. But oh, what a lot you will miss!When the restaurant’s name boasts of Tonkatsu, it seems almost rude to order anything else. The pork is from different varieties of pig, with different proportions of fat to meat. So ask when you order if you have preferences or aversions to fat.The Tokusen Kurobuta Rosu Katsu Set, has 160g of pork loin from the famed black pig. It was tender and juicy with a fair amount of fat along the edge. It is done to just very slightly pink in the middle, hence the tenderness. The slab of meat comes cut into thick slices, each ringed in a thick coat of deep golden, crisp breaded batter. It is tonkatsu on steroids, unlike the thin slivers in pale batter served in most other places.One has the choice of white or brown rice and the set includes a vegetable soup and a mountain of thinly-sliced crisp cabbage. The rice and cabbage are topped up to as much as you want. The meal also comes with a small cup of refreshing jelly for dessert.The tonkatsu in the Hungary Mangalica Rosu Katsu Set seemed to have a thicker edge of fat, although we were told otherwise. It is also slightly more tender to the bite. The menu also offers smaller servings or jumbo servings for different appetites.The service was excellent at its Mandarin Gallery outlet. There are five other branches elsewhere on the island. Bookings are probably not allowed as there are long queues on weekends
4
So I found myself wandering around the Chijmes complex on a Sunday lunch time, spoilt for choice with lots of amazing looking places to eat.Enticed by a menu that I only half understood I chose this place.The service was good and even though I was not 100% sure what I was ordering, I soon found my feet and had a delicious looking array of food and drink in front of me.Pork Katsu (?) with rice and pickles and other stuff that all tasted wonderful. I have to admit I did have to look around the room to see how the soup was supposed to be consumed (not with a spoon as we do in the west).A wonderful authentic meal in a nice location with good service. Perfec
5
I can't help to drag myself to this restaurant every time I go to Singapore. I think they sell the best tonkatsu in the world with a lot of choices of menu. My friend who lived in Singapore introduced me to this restaurant and I found out that you can refill the rice and salad as many as you like... I hope that they'll open in Jakarta
3
The shop is located on level 2 in Mandarin building next to Takashimaya. Accessible location.They provide various options of katsu such from pork lion, fillet to sea food such as oyster or crab meat. The problem is they offer nothing but katsu (fried) types of food. Not even side dishes to clean off my mouth... I wish they would have some light food like salad or some noodle with soup to balance out
5
My wife and I went to the one located in Chijmes but could not find it here on TA, therefore the review here. The place was really really good, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the waitress that served us. Everything just came together and we had a lovely dinner. Inexpensive and great value for money
5
We ordered the black pork tonkatsu, ebi katsu, oyster and fish katsu. The black pork special katsu is the best katsu we ever had. You should definitely try. The set menu (brown rice, miso soup, salad) tasted really good and complement the katsu well. Try their special miso sauce, which tasted better than their regular sauce. Definitely a place to come back
1
Went over for a lunch celebration for a colleague who was leaving. Required a table for 8, and was told that the only location possible for such arrangement in the restaurant was taken and so we can either sit 2x4 or they can only fit 7 chairs to the joined table. This was ridiculous, as the tables at the restaurant were all movable and tehy were just plain lazy to shift it around. And i will not forget to add the the service lead, by the name of Bryan (bald Pinoy guy), had a stinking holier-than-thou attitude that just made the experience of deciding to not dine there so much easier. This is such a shame, considering that we did actually stayed on and had pretty good Tonkatsu there. To the restaurant management, i understand that there is a manpower crunch in SG for F&B staff. But pls have some decency to at least accord your diners some minimal service and respect by hiring staff who are actually polite. People who are slower can be trained. People who have terrible attitude just shouldn't be allowed at the frontline, especially in F&B. We are paying customers, and we do not have to subject ourselves to such terrible treatment by your staff
4
1st time experience and one of my friends enjoyed the free refills thoroughly. There is brown or white rice for you to choose from, to go with the Tonkatsu you ordered. Quite a sincere eatery as the brown rice comes with other grain(s), miso soup was filled with ingredients, dips were of different variety, etc. I think the Tonkatsu was not exactly exceptional if you eat it on its own. Overall experience was great, in big part due to the condiments provided and free refills from cabbage, soup, rice to roasted barley drink. Would go again with family

So I'm not a big fan of fried foods to begin with but the refills of cabbage, tea and miso soup was a nice touch. While the tonkatsu was very average, the condiments really did bring out the flavour. They have directions on how to use: salt, sauce and ground up sesame seeds which really brought out the flavour of the pork. The service was prompt, I had no complaints. The seating is comfortable, cushioned wood with Japanese style and well spaced. Although there were kids nearby, the noise was not noticeable. For the price, I find this expensive compared to hawker market but if you are a fan of tonkatsu and in this area, this place will do

First time to Tonkatsu Ma Masion @ Westgate! The pork loin is superb - juicy n taste good! Service is good as well and best part is free replenish of cabbage which most Tonkatsu restaurant in Singapore does not provide this service anymore !Only pity is this restaurant @ Chijmes actually has a 10% discount for JCB card holder but Wesrgate branch doesn't ;

The food at Tonkatsu Maison was as usual good but service was lackluster and absolutely deplorable. 4 service crew but took forever to be seated, store manager the lady in a red tie was the worse of the bunch. Staff spoke in hawker style English and without complete sentences! "White rice or brown", "tea?". Are they even aware of what is appropriate service language? I doubt it. Manager or supervisor insisted I place my bag at the counter even though I said I will place it under the table. She then raise her voice to say it will block the way and I aaid "under the table". She was hostile and ill-mannered totally contrary to what a true Japanese hospitality is suppose to epitomize. She threw dirty glances and lack the personal response, and sometimes even without any response in the first place. If not for the food, I will probably never ever step into this place ever again. A total disgrace to Japanese culture, or perhaps she had stayed too long in Singapore and learned all the negative traits. Because of this negative character I will strongly recommend that all patrons either reduce or totally remove any contact with this individual or simply source for an alternate dining venue.Food seemed authentic enough but service was far from any Japan infused or even lightly tainted. Chopsticks are placed slanted horizontal which is meant for death rituals, and absolutely a no-no in Japan. ANY store in Japan offers better service then Tonkatsu by Ma Maison! Name of deplorable supervisor/Manager is Kazumi

Finally had the chance to visit this outlet as there was surprisingly no queue on a Sunday night. Had the Mille-feuille pork and it was quite delicious, but still not yet the standard that I had in Tonkichi in Orchard Central.However, the price for a similar dish is 20% cheaper in Tonkatsu Bistro and the cabbage, soup and rice was offered free flow. Not a deal breaker but for one that craves for Tonkatsu and stays in the western area like me, go for it.Service was very prompt and staffs were attentive too, probably due to the quiet evening crowd. Definitely will be back again soon

I'm a big tonkatsu fan, and was quite happy that this restaurant was located in the shopping centre annexed to my hotel.In a word: great. In the area, the three tonkatsu places are this one, Tonkichi (Ngee Ann City) and the tonkatsu shop in the basement of Takashimaya (also Ngee Ann City, I forgot the name of the restaurant). This one is the priciest, and I think probably the most enjoyable for me, namely due to:+ The location (convenient for me)+ The pork (fattier/juicier, I think)+ ServiceThey have a few options on the type of pig and type (normal, kurobuta, Hungarian and Mille-feuille). Due to a rather long stay in Singapore, I had the opportunity to try all four types. The Hungarian is probably the fattiest of the four, and most enjoyable for me - though I couldn't eat anything else for the rest of the day due to satiation. If I had to eat something more regularly, I'd probably just choose the kurobuta or normal, though.I also had the occassion to try their Hiroshima Oysters, which were quite nice and make a nice change from pork.They are also currently serving Nagoya style tonkatsu, which serves tonkatsu using a miso-based sauce instead of the normal sweet tonkatsu sauce. I've had this type of tonkatsu in Nagoya before, and their version of this was quite good! Though, I personally prefer just the normal tonkatsu sauce, so won't be ordering this very often. Good for memories' sake though.The mixed grain rice was fluffier than the normal white rice and preferable for me.Their tonjiru (pork miso soup) was also enjoyable, and unlimited. The service is good, especially for a solo traveller for me. There are counters where solo eaters can sit in relatively privacy, enough for a magazine or two. The staff are friendly and prompt, which is always appreciated. I think the service here is better than Tonkichi, where the staff have a tendency to shout quite loudly at each other, which sometimes ruins the dinner atmosphere

Title says it all - interesting menu, only for Tonkatsu fans of course, since all items are breaded and deep fried... however the service stands out for its severe limitations; idiotic little rules for everything (where to seat, the ordering of extra items, even requesting an extra spoon is adventurous), entirely inexperienced staff and somewhat uninvolved manager - the place is also freezing. Very disappointing overall
5
The cheese mille feuille pork fillet is absolutely delicious! The grilled saba is also a very good option.Rice, Miso and Salad are free flow, so come down when you are really hungry and it will be totally worth it.Service however is really really slow. They are frightfully understaffed so the ones moving around are overworked, stressed and distracted. Been the same with no change each time I've gone back

The menu is really all Tonkatsu so if you're wanting to eat healthy and reduce deep fried foods, give this a miss. Having said that, we had delicious appetizers - crab croquettes and fried oysters. The katsu curry and korubuta pork set were above average.They serve an interesting roast barley tea and a jelly dessert that is quite refreshing.There is frequently a line to get into the restaurant giving the impression that it is very popular. However it's largely because of the slow service though they are friendly

Don't think I'll be returning anymore. The food has become mediocre.I can taste that the oil used for frying is not as fresh as before, and even the fried oysters which I loved have become fried balls of flour.I can get the same standard at any neighborhood kopitiam.

I have been here last week, cos I heard this is the best place in Singapore to get Tonkatsu! I can just say is true.! It was very nice and I will be back vey soon. Just the service is slow, to get food we wait about 35 minutes , cos the place was crowded 
4
Great food.staff really helpfull.a little but pricey but it's really popular they were queuing to get in.maybe a bigger drink menu might help..but overall really enjoyed the food and that's what's matters.
5
Amazing food! It can get a little pricey though - it was $70 in total for a two-person meal. Be sure to order the tonkatsu with prawn if you are afraid you would get bored of the tokatsu taste.

I discovered this place on a random walk about. The restaurant is stacked away from the main section of the mall. I secret gem, the food was excellence and I recommend the mixed Tonkatsu (if you have never had this before). Staff are friendly and helpful. Will be back

Very nice katsu meal, if you can stand the wait in line. I think the secret is on the salad dressing..since it seems people cant get enough of it. The meat is very tasty and the coatingis not too filling, which makes it nice for late afternoon meal
4
Believe it or not, the best part of the meal is the veggie salad. The dressing is very good, the cabbage is very fresh. The katsu itself is not bad at all, perfect combination with the salad. So next time, skip the rice, and go with salad and chicken katsu. Nice and healthy meal
4
You have to try this. The meat is so tender and moist. The sauce is tasty. The veggie and its dressing is to die for. I normally did not eat veggies, but I make exception for this place. Lol. The waiting line can be long sometimes, especially during holiday season
4
This one is different from other restaurants' tonkatsu. The meat is just tender and well fried, the salad and the sesame dressing goes well with everything. Meanwhile the staffs were so helpful and gave us plenty of unlimited salad & rice. The organic rice there was so yummy and I can have 2-3 bowls by myself! Definitely coming back to satisfy my craving for the best tonkatsu

The tonkutsu is fried to perfection and tastes good on its own or dip it in the sweet tonkutsu sauce. Their katsudon with brown rice is highly recommended. The eggs and onion completes the dish nicely, making you want to finish the llast grain. Set comes with appertizer of radish ball, cabbage salad, miso soup, roasted rice tea, and jelly to finish off the meal. Not sure if they allow reservation. Can get crowded on a saturday night. Good to sit at the counter, as you can see how the delicious tonkatsu is prepared. But no pictures allowed near the kitchen

We had a late lunch at Tonkatsu by Ma Maison. We felt the tables and booths provided a reasonable amount of distance from other diners. We shared a pork tonkatsu with curry sauce. It tasted so good that we ordered a chicken katsu that was delicious with the mustard that was provided with it. We felt the chicken katsu tasted even better than the pork tonkatsu. We appreciated having lots of cabbage salad, and we felt the rice was delicious. We had green tea ice cream for dessert which took an excessively long time to arrive and was not special. But we would go back for the chicken katsu which we felt was a very good value considering the location in Mandarin Gallery

Living in Japan for 2,5 years made me a bit sceptical and snobbish about the quality of japanese food outside Japan. But i think ma maison did a great job serving delicious katsu fried with good quality pork. They categorize the meat/pork from different parts (i think hire katsu is the best) and different grade of pork. Apart from the long wait, the service was great. The staff would walk around offering more salads or rice, and they let us sit until they were about to close the restaurant. So, no rush, sit back and enjoy. I would definitely go back for my next stop in singapore
