Great variety at affordable prices, especially the lunch sets! It's a pity that the special flavoured wings weren't available for ordering, though the menu was placed on the table.
3
Quality Japanese food at affordable price. Try the various hotpot available with generous meat portions.
4
Food is nice and waiting time for food to be served is not too Long...no hassle with the Chole reservation
4
Our drink and salad came within minutes upon ordering on the mobile tablet but the bara chirashidon wasn't fresh. Got fishy taste
4
Had a pleasant dining experience with a friend at Watami. There was a nice variety of dishes to try.
4
My overseas guests - a couple with an 18-yr-old son who has studied in Singapore for the past 4 years, have enjoyed the set menu for 4. It was good value for money because the food was delicious. What can be improved is the service in terms of me having to go and look for the servers because we were seated way back inside the restaurant
4
We ordered two hot pot sets; the dashi soup was excellent. The beef was very nice and sufficient for that price. In addition, we also topped up another two portions of beef.We also ordered the skewer set and it was quite good and generous.The service was good
4
I was glad to make a reservation online through Chope in advance. The restaurant was full during lunch hour. Their lunch menu set has a variety of food items at an affordable price. In addition, we were allowed to choose our choice of hot/cold beverage that is included in the set meal. It tasted good and the food portion was enough to fill our stomach. Service level was alright. I will come to Watami again.

Ordered white Ramen and Fried Tofu with cheese and Mentai sauce. Ramen soup base was decent but somehow I don't quite like the noodles. I prefer Ajisen's noodles as it has more texture. A bit of a disappointment as standard seems to have fallen since about 5 years ago? Maybe it's just the ramen being not on par with Ajisen. Will try the tempura dishes next time.I went to the Buona Vista outlet and the hotpots seem to be very popular there
4
The food are delicious . however the time to wait to be served is slow. waitress and waiter keep forgetting to service us the drink (1 drink was miss out) and we have to ask twice and finally got the drink after my friend finished the food. The rest of us got our drinks before our food are served
4
Great place for lunch, without a need to queue. Quiet ambience where I was able to chat with my friend without being interrupted.
4
i was greeted with a warm smile, friendly, cheerful and knowledgeable staff of the restaurant who were willing to go to the extra mile without any expectations.
5
they already reserved a table for us and we were shown to the table very promptly. the service was great!
4
My Neighbourhood family restaurant. Good food- value for money and friendly service. Just that some seats are in the sun.
4
Good overall value for food. Nice ambience for big gatherings as well. However food quality is average.
3
Have housefly and quite dirty. Server was also a little blur and not very helpful or nice So not very good experience
4
Service was fast & able to make reservation via Chope. Lunch set was very worth. Highly recommended.

The menu is extensive and prices are affordable. My favourite is the signature Watami salad ($9.90), a delightful mix of tuna, grilled chicken chunks, cherry tomatoes, crisp wanton skin slivers, shrimps on a bed of fresh greens tossed with Jap sesame sauce. It was satisfying to toss all the ingredients together and the portion was sizeable. We also had the Snowing Sukiyaki, where a bubbling pot of beef sukiyaki was topped with a billowing mass of candy floss. As the candy floss melts into the broth, the culinary fun begins - a very satisfying hotpot
4
Loved the lunch sets that start at $9.90++ I had the salmon stone bowl set for $13.90++ the salmon was yummy and it came with ikura that tasted fresh! Together with a agedashi tofu and salad and miso soup! The food was good but as I was eating I heard a crispy crunch and thought it was a burnt rice grain . Only later did I notice that parts of the top of the stonebowl had chipped and it was black in colour, blending in with the colour of the bowl. I notified the staff and they were kind enough to remove my item from the bill!

I’ve always loved Watami because of their service and food. I usually dine at J8 and Ion’s branch but today I visited Star Vista’s as I was nearby. The wafu pizza (my favourite) tasted really different from the usual pizza where it’s crispy and less lards. I’m not sure why it tasted nothing like the pizza I usually have but more like a kebab wrap. The servers there were not very prompt and lack of professional touch. The shabu shabu tasted great though, because it is hotpot.. Overall I will not visit this branch
4
Good food, but service to be improved. Food for 2 pax came 30 mins apart. Servers too busy to attend to customers.
3
They were able to fulfill my Japanese cravings and I left the place feeling full, happy and very satisfied!
3
We went to this restaurant after church service. Generally, the food is so-so only but the restaurant seems to be under staffed.
2
Limited choices on the type of RAMEN. There is a need to review the menu to have more choices in the menu
5
Normally go to Ion but now they have changed the name and no more sukiyaki. Sukiyaki is very nice and watami salad is superb
2
There were plenty of service staff, however, they were clustered together and it was difficult to get their attention. Food was not as good as compared with other Watami branches.
3
We came across this restaurant at the Star Vista yesterday and we decided to try out the lunch set for two.We went there around 1pm as we wanted to avoid the heavy lunchtime crowd. We were served quickly and unfortunately all dishes were not served hot...the quality of the food could be better if the food came are not served at room temperature. However, we enjoyed the drinks anyway. The restaurant was very warm inside the air conditioned environment
2
Tried out Watami for the first time. Service was disappointing, Food was worse. Thou it was decently platable for some dishes, This is the beef rice that we had was served warm, so I suspect it sat there for a long time before it was served. Major disappointment. The kids meal is of a good portion but the karage was more flour than chicken. The Real Man hotpot was pretty good on the other hand Service was lack-lustre. I'm sure the staff were overwhelmed by the amount of work in a barely half-filled restaurant. I think they are better off just setting up a self help station and I didn't have to bother any service.For the price point, you are better of at the other japanese restaurant upstairs.

Had a family dinner with 2 kids and 4 adults. Firstly, I don't understand why they needed a machine to arrange / get a table seating. It's redundant and waste of electricity & paper for printing. It's not such a big restaurant that you need such a machine. Next, the staff were curt and I don't know why they are so overwhelmed. There's 4 of them, maybe a better system needed to be in place. The menu is sufficient but mainly focuses on hotpot. We ordered 3 hot pots, beef, seafood & Korean. Sets were from $18.90 - $21.90. Came with a drink, 3 slices of sashimi & rice. It's ok value. What I did not like was the individual "fire" gas stoves for the hot pot. They seemed to be individual little gas stoves which had had canisters overturned and filled gas into each stove. Then the canister was removed and the stoves were lit with a lighter fire. Felt so dangerous. I kept wondering - will it explode??Then we were seated next to this cabinet where they stored several of these stoves and open gas canisters. And then the staff kept trying to use lighters to light these gas stoves in this corner with open flames. Some of the stoves didn't seem to work and the staff was looking frustrated trying repeated to light the stoves using the lighter flame. It was quite distressing. I was quite afraid something might go wrong and the flame they used to light the gas stoves might cause the gas canisters all to explode on us as they are all so near! I couldn't concentrate too much on my meal. The hot pots were ok. Not over the top fantastic or anything. Portion size was adequate. Tendon was quite large in portion for $13.90. Had prawns, fried egg, chicken, veg etc over rice. The so-called No.1 in Japan fried chicken was just ok too. It's nice but not wow. For $8.90, it was ok. A filling meal for 6 people at $99 after taxes. Would have been more value for money if we ordered the set for 3 at $78 but my sister didn't want to. Would I be back? Taste & price is ok, service needs improvement but I'm too afraid of those gas stoves and gas canisters!

The staff are well trained and efficient. Witnessed the huge mess left by three mothers with their toddlers at a table, but without making a show of it, the staff turned the table around for the lunch crowd in minutes. I ordered the chirashi don. For its price of $19.90, there were three juicy scallops and an assortment of other seafood. The rice taste good too.
4
The food was served within 10mins after ordering. Value for money. Counter was not attended for awhile, guess it was lunch hour and a little short of staff. Other than that, all's well.
4
Set menu had options for selection. Choice of dishes was good.
There was an electronic device to place order with.
3
Service needs improvement. iPad ordering is available, but not working well. Food is served pretty fast, but tasted quite salty.
4
i was greeted with a warm friendly smile by the staff and the service was provided by cheerful employee.
5
amazing experience. Great service with servers who pay kind attention to customers' request. service was prompt and excellent.
5
Food was very good. They had a steamboat offer but unfortunately we had to order it for everyone to enjoy the offer. It was a pleasant experience
5
There were 6 of us, and we really enjoy the spacious place there. The price of the food is reasonable. Very good experience~
4
the staff at the restaurant was very helpful, the service was courteous, fast, efficient and right on spot.
4
My family I frequent Watami Star Vista as the food quality and prices are reasonable. Their lunch and student value meals are indeed true value for money. The excellent service staff like Mr Song and Ms Ruby keep us happy that we had become regulars. It helps that we stay nearby hence we could patronise it more often than other Japanese restaurants
4
Went specially for mentaiko cheese seasonal menu. Tried the fried camembert, tamagoyaki and udon from this seasonal menu, all were really good! But on the expensive side. Soup for mushroom hot pot was rich and good comfort food too. Service was OK but could have been warmer. Overall enjoyable experience
5
Went for Watami's steamboat buffet $15.90++ - extremely worth it! Rather good quality of beef and pork, and of course broth.
5
Had the hotpot this visit, meat is very fresh, soup is tasty.
Service is prompt and service staff helpful and police.
4
Ordered a $9.90 don set and it was well worth the price.
The Buona V outlet also offers hotpot yay
Service was friendly and informative, we were there from 11:30-2pm and they were good with it.
Lighting and decor is quite nice, not over-the-top.
4
Food was served pretty fast. We had 2 sets and an a la carte which were served fresh and delicious. The ordering system was easy to navigate. The only gripe is the payment system could not process our AMEX card - no idea why though.
4
The restaurant was packed with customers and the waitress who served us was friendly and approachable.
4
A decent place if you're looking for value for money japanese food. The place was particularly understaffed given that it was the eve of the chinese new year but this was to be expected. Staff were trying their best regardless.
4
went here with family. Ordered the seafood and beef hotpot (forgot the exact name). There were lots of vegetables and not much of the meat. Soup taste good though.
2
The service is bad, avoid this branch. There are other much better branches. I have better experience elsewhere.
5
They have revamped their menu and added new items. The food is great, service is prompt with friendly staff. A great hangout place.

Knew about this restaurant from the poster on the escalator. I ordered a $55++ set meal for two people. It comes with a salad, 1 appetizer, 2 side dishes, 1 rice or noodles and 2 drinks. I paid about $68 after taxes. I added $1 for the salad and it was a big bowl with a variety of vegetables including slices of pumpkin, raw shrimps and I think a scoop of tuna. It was fresh and tasty with the sesame dressing. We ordered salmon with avocado sushi for appetizer, teriyaki grilled salmon (with $4 waived) and the skewed vegetables as the 2 side dishes and salmon and roe don on hot stone (added $1). All were very delicious especially the teriyaki grilled salmon with ginger. Restaurant is just opposite Buona Vista MRT station. Convenient location
5
Thanks for serving free water. I don't believe in paying for water. Food was great because I could quench my thirst before eating. Like the sukiyaki that had cotton candy on top to melt into. Thought it'd be too sweet but it wasn't.
4
Nice food, but the restaurant is in need of a slight renovation. The service is a little bit slow but the food is nice and good
3
The staff are pretty attentive but seemed to be short on manpower during busy periods. Food is slightly above Average and value for price
4
I already ate at this Resto for two times, the taste of food is delicious, price reasonable. Ambience it's okay.
But they had one minus point, lack of man power.
2
Very disappointed with this outlet. Previous experience was better. Food was not good at all. Sad that my previous Watami experience was at least acceptable.
5
Always like the hot pot salmon rice, with blob of butter and seaweeds. Fragrantly cooked within the hot pot, rice hot throughout meal.
4
Food was good and reasonably priced. Service can be improved. Will be good if there are more varieties for set menu.
4
Like the option of choosing your own dishes to make up the whole set menu. Pizza was great. Service was ok too.
4
Simple and comforting Japanese food. Nothing overly extravagant. Casual dining at wallet-friendly prices.
4
Food was good and the portions not bad, but few staff to tend to orders or bill. Overall, a good dinner with the family :)
4
The place is spacious and quiet and it is suitable for friend gathering. The food serving speed is relatively slow and it maybe because peak hours. In overall, good place for friend gathering.
4
This time round, I ordered the small bowl of salmon with rice, without realising how tiny the portion was. So that was my fault.
Their lava cake was not bad. If I come again, I would order something else.
4
The menu has improved a lot since the last time i ate there a few years ago. the sashimi is expensive but the rest of the stuff is cheap and good value.
I would recomend!
4
Staffs are friendly. But iPad menu interface is very confusing.I ordered something I wasn't aware until it's served
5
A great venue for family outing and delicious food. The casual atmosphere was inviting and comfortable for chats and laughter
3
Food was good but very slow service. Was quite disappointed with the pizza. Wasn't as good as compare to the one i had previously.
2
Restaurant seemed unaware that they are part of Chope, and when told of reservation, simply shrugged me off to wait aside. Obviously, they were unaware of the ongoing promo of $10 rebate. Hence, we did not get the promo honored. Food served was slow, we waited almost 3o minutes for the first person's order to come, and another 15-30 mins for the remaining orders to arrive. Think that'd be the last lunch we have there on a working weekday

Was at Watami, Star Vista for lunch on the 6 Nov 16 to celebrate my daughter's 12th birthday.When we stepped into the rrestaurant, the server could not find out reservation and we waited for a while before we got a table.We ordered the set meal as well as an ala-carte rice. We had almost finished our food but the rice was not served.We spoke to the same server who brought us to our table, he just said he would check and but the food never came until we spoke to the Manager/ Supervisor who went into the kitchen personally to check on it.He was really apologetic and even helped us clear our table of used plates.Noticed that he was the only one working genuinely, the rest of the servers didn't seem very interested in what they were doing.We couldn't get any server's attention when we wanted to pay so I walked over to the cashier to make payment instead.The cashier (saw on his name tag that he was a temporary part timer).He seemed a little lost and not sure what he was supposed to do.I made a reservation under the Visa Giveaway and but the money was not offset from my total bill... I only realised that when I reached home :(Guess that was too late to highlight as I had already left.My family and I had always celebrated our birthdays at Watami as we love the food and cost ambience but this experience was quite disappointing
2
We were 8 persons who came for a team lunch...First they don't have tables for 8 so we were separated in tables, then services was damn long.1 table choice was no more avail. After ordering the food and they have been served 1h after our arrival. At our table 1 out of the 4 guests was served as well 1h after while 2 of them were having the same dish. Why ?Food quality was ok but definitely understaff and too long, I won't come back until the service is improve

Had dinner here on a Saturday. We arrived before 6pm, and the place was almost empty; the place began to get crowded after 6:30pm.We ordered Pumpkin & Sweet Potato Tempura, Chicken Cutlet with Scrambled Egg Sauce, Salmon & Roe Rice in Stone Pot, Pork Rice in Stone Pot, Kyushu Pork Broth Ramen (Black), and Chocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream.The Tempura were all really thin slices, which felt like it's not worth the S$8.90 that they charge. They served the Salmon & Roe Rice in Stone Pot first but, for some reason we didn't understand, the Pork Rice in Stone Pot took quite a while to arrive, long after all the other items have been served.The food tasted OK, passable for Japanese food though not fantastic. For the price that we paid, it was slightly expensive.What we didn't like, though, was the way the tables were arranged: most of the tables were quite close together. Our table was literally just next to the next table, with only the menus, which they put standing upright on a stand, serving as a partition between the two tables. If this were a fast food restaurant, it would have been OK, but in a mid-range restaurant and yet not having some "privacy" is kind of uncomfortable.We found the staff here responsive enough.Overall, this was an acceptable place for a meal if you are not having high expectations
