Not only creative but also very delicious. The location itself is cosy but not spectacular but you also come because of the great food and and not for the interior.

The ambience was very chill and pleasant. We visited Afterglow at 2:15pm and we were lucky that there weren't many customers around. We enjoyed the quiet time there with great raw food :)
4
Interesting menu, relatively friendly staff, a bit pricey & small portions but I’d said worth a visit ! Vegan friendly all the way
4
Portions on the smaller side but great quality.
We had nice white wine, açaí and quac.
Nice decor- very chill and literally cool inside
2
Much can be done to improve on taste, presentation and value for money of the dishes. The service was friendly but can't make up for overalldisappointment.
The owners need to spend more time to work on the menu.
4
Pleasantly surprised by the creativity and taste of the vegetarian food. Good stuff! Will visit again.

I shared the Kim chi avocado rolls with my friends which were very tasty! For my main, I ordered the zucchini linguini which I did not expect to be cold (did not read the menu that it was prepared raw) and portions were huge! I wasn't able to finish it but overall the 'meatballs' were very tasty and I got my daily intake of veggies from this dish
1
We had high expectations since the review are mostly good. hence I suspect some of the reviews are paid for because t was really disappointing. The food was cold, super small portions, and very pricey for its portion. I don't normally eat much to feel full but here I still feel hungry after appetiser & main course. I've tried a few vegetarian restaurants and I really think this is the worst one. The service is so bad too. Su food restaurant is much better than here. I won't recommend to anyone to try here
3
We had a nice evening at Afterglow, a cool vegetarian/vegan place in Keong Saik.The food was really good, fresh, nicely prepared, but unfortunately, the service was really bad. First of all we had to wait 25 min before we finally got the attention of a waiter to place our order. When we started getting our starters they said they where sold out of one of the items... and then before we had got all of the starters they started bringing us the mains... and while all this was going on they asked us to place the dessert order... Having said that, food was really good.
2
While I’m waiting for friend, I ordered a wine. Colour and the taste is a bit off. I’m not a wine expert but I’m a regular drinker for that kind of wine so I can taste the different. I’m not a sarcastic person, and don’t tend to make any complain here but give my opinion that this place may offer a good healthy dish but if you want to order wine, please think twice. Even the business owner also could consider to remove this from your menu if you cannot control the quality. *the charge of a glass of wine is slightly above standard with this qualit
5
This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants I found in Singapore. Food is fresh and tasty. Delicious. Ambience is hip. Dining healthy and not sacrificing taste.
5
Good atmosphere good environment n location, suitable for gathering. Food are awesome!! And also the desert was great! Will be back there again!
5
Nice ambience, good choice, prompt service and tasty food. Visited afterglow for a dinner and enjoyed the experience. A bit pricey but worth the price. Ordered the kimchi soup, nuggets, the burgers. The service was quick. Definitely worth trying.
3
Quite special with raw food making but all dishes pricing are at the high side. The juices are highly priced.
4
... vegetarian and vegan food, fresh from farm to table. You sit at quirky tables - ours had been the table to an old treadle sewing machine. Helpful staff to advise on menu choices for diners with food allergies, etc. It was a quiet (late-ish) lunchtime when we went in, and stayed that way for the duration of our meal, but that is not to say it doesn't get busy at different times of the day. Good food and good service but not overly price
4
The quality and price of the food is both high and very good. The food was a little unusual but very tasty. Ordered Roasted Cauliflower ($10), Guacamole Platter ($14), Raw Pizza ($22), Raw Crispy Lasagne ($22), Rice Bowl ($16) and some drinks. the food were all delicious and the experience was unique. The only problem was that the portions were too small. So immediately after dinner we went for supper at the zichar a few doors down
3
We were close by and wanted somewhere vegetarian to eat dinner.The menu is relatively small and the meals we chose zucchini linguini and didn't read the menu carefully enough because it does say prepared at 45 degrees C or less; that means raw.A few other dishes are referred to as "warm" but we don't know what that means.Probably a little over-priced for what it was; our meals cost SGD20 each + service charge, which was a bit rich !We wouldn't return
4
This little cafe on Keong Saik Road in Chinatown is perfect for those looking for gluten-free, raw or healthier food options. The raw chocolate and salted 'caramel' slice I had was amazing - clever use of avocadoes for a totally creamy texture! I plan to return soon for a complete meal.
4
Maybe one of my Favourite place in the Neighbourhood largely due to its delicious and healthy menu, using tasteful ingredients, and Creative cuisine. Service is very lovely and I appreciate the small terrace to enjoy the street vibe, or the a/c part when it's too hot!
5
We ordered the following: Drinks: -Fresh coconut water with chia seeds: the coconut was really lovely and sweet -Seasonal fruit juice: nicely balanced EntrÃ©e:-Roasted Cauliflower: the dip was great and good flavour balancing the turmeric -KimChi Rolls: nice and crunchy, the avocado was a very nice texture to add to the crisp Mains:-Quinoa burger with vegan bun (warm dish): the quinoa hash brown patty was really very nice. It almost tasted like kefta. It came with sweet potato fries and an awesome cabbage salad. -Zucchini linguine with 'meat'balls (cold dish): oh my god those 'meat'balls were epic. So awesome. The 'pasta' did not even feel like zucchini. So lovely. Dessert:-Raw chocolate salted caramel fudge: I have to admit I'm a dessert foodies and wow was I impressed. The base being made with date and nuts made for a great crunch under the fudge chocolate caramel. One of the best desserts I've ever had. Total bill: $109. Thank you Afterglow for making this experience so great and for showing people that being vegan and healthy is super tasty and achievable. Definitely coming back!
4
Surprisingly good vegan food. Loved the zucchini noodles, kimchi sushi, and desserts! especially the acai bowl.
4
Food is certainly different. Had the lasagna and quinoa hash, it's nice, but not enough flavours to carry through the whole dish to give that satisfied feeling after eating.
4
Great service! Prompt and helpful, though it was rather empty for a Saturday night. Food was, on the most part, very nice and creative and filling. It's always wonderful to find a place that understands that vegetarians are foodies too!
3
This restaurant is nicely decorated, menu is great with vegetatian/vegan options. The food is nice but I would say the portions are quite small, especially compared to the prices which are quite high in my opinion.
4
Food tastes decent. However the prices are high. Service crew is friendly. The cake we had was tasty.
5
The Afterglow is here to show people that healthy food can (and IS) absolutely delicious and Creative!
4
Quaint place. Good for catching up and chatting. Decent vegetarian options as well. Nice setting to dine in. :)
3
Came back to this vegetarian restaurant this week, this time for dinner, and mainly because we had a visitor who is a very strict vegetarian. I opted for one of the "burgers" which was very tasty, but was also quite tiny. So I ended up suffering the same issue as last time, that the portions are too small. Not particularly cheap given the sizes. Beer and wine are also available, but also not particularly cheap
4
Salads were quite nice. Rest food nice but not mind blowing, fairly basic but good raw recipes. Added points for warm food options on menu. They were changing the menu so some items were not available when we visted. They have decebt wine and other alcohol options too, so not all tamed out.If you can avoid that, one of very few raw vegan restaurant alternate in Singapore. To healthy eating!
4
I went for lunch with a friend (who is a meat eater) and we set outside. We got the green juice which was very good and large size, for staters the kimchi raw sushi made with almonds was delicious and filling and for main the "pizza" - which was also excellent with a dehidrated basis, an avocado-cashew basis and yummy sauce and vegetables. We were getting full but we still had the desert plater with very good salted caramel fudge and pink frozen roses made with coconut oil, cashew and fruit. Highly recommended
5
Me and my wife always struggle to find good and healthy food, and this is our new favourite!! Worth coming, and great food and service
4
Very good atmosphere cafe. Friendly service staff. Food was delicious but portion slightly little.
This is vegan cafe so for those ain't vegan might find the food little bland.
4
The food is great! We particularly liked the desserts! It is a nice, little restaurant in the heart of the colonial part of the city! One little drawback though, the prices are a bit on the high side.
4
The set lunches are worth it. Although the lighting is a little dim, it was a good cozy place to have a quiet weekday afternoon.
3
I had the brown rice burger and we shared Saigon rolls. It was a bit tasteless and quite a small portion considering the price. Their beetroot, apple and ginger juice was great.
3
This was my second visit to Afterglow. The first time round the food was good, and service was average. Our server served food in chipped plates. After paying good money for the food, who would like to eat out of chipped off plates!! How can they be so careless? The servers are so disengaged; no warm smiles or greetings, or any interest in how our meal was going on. But since I enjoyed the food, I came back with another group of friends. The star dish was the fettucine with walnut balls and the pom salad. After that it was all downhill.. the quinoa burger was complete let down. It came with limp fries, and no flavoring. We tell the server this amd she says this is how it is. Does it not matter if customers are unhappy?The rissotto was watery!! The baked cauliflower was simply bland!!!! What happened??Not going back..
5
I know not everyone's crazy about raw food but it so important to stay healthy and afterglow makes it really easy with all the detectable options in their menu. I could hardly decide what to get so definitely coming back to try the other dishes. I don't really see the point in getting a salad here cuz everything is basically a salad in disguise but they do have a nice lunch option of salad and soup. I had the raw vegan spaghetti with cashew "meatballs" so good.
1
We are vegetarians for a few years, such a horrible food I've never eaten(( the Salad was just leaves for salads, and undercooked potatoes, and everything!! the product is inedible, it is not tasty, the prices are expensive. Just not worth it to go there, horrible food and expensive price even for Singapor
2
I went once for lunch and had a lunch set, it was about a soup and a quinoa salad.I honestly was not very impressed by the variety in the menu, the taste of the salad was quite plain and it was more about greens than quinoa.The price was a bit too high for the meal and the quantity.I had the feeling that they could have done it better as I tried raw food somewhere else.It definitely didn't impress me.The service was good
4
I booked a seat via Chope but arrived late on last Saturday so that I could sit outdoors. But in the end the outdoor seats seemed to be more charming with the direct view of the delicate shophouse facade opposite the street. The sushi roll was innovative with crashed almond as "sushi rice". The popular Drag-Pom bowl was a picturesque, refreshing salad bowl consisting of dragon fruit, pomegranate, avocado, macadamia nuts and lettuce. I also ordered a bottle of live cultured water originated from Japan which was a nice try for me. Overall, service was excellent as the waiter (or owner?) was super attentive and served with passion. The only down side was the slightly high price for vegan food.
2
Portion too small, too expensive for the food. Not suitable for big eater like me.
Contain onion and garlic in most of the dishes
4
Great atmos, great servers, great smiles! Food was delicious, but I guess most healthy food won't be like finger licking good 😂 But deconstructed sushi bowl was whoosh! Really power!
4
Went with a Friend and it was a very good experience. The selection was intriguing as I am not used to raw or semi raw food. But it was very tasty.
4
The food is fresh and well prepared. Healthy choice. Service is prompt and the staff is helpful. It has been a pleasant visit. Great for dinner with vegetarian friends.
5
Well presented organic, vegan fare appetising even for omnivores. Service was attentive, and we'd recommend the nori rolls and the caramel chocolate dessert.
5
Souch an elegant gem to visit with really nice variety of healthy food. The menu is joy to look at and the staff is wonderful. A really cozy place to stick around as well. Def recommended for any health, plant based people or if you just like cool interior.
2
We ordered the deconstructed sushi bowl, mashed asparagus salad both of which were a disappointment. The sushi bowl was essentially black rice with specks of edamame, cucumber and seaweed. The mashed avocado salad was essentially a potato salad covered in avocado. The ambience and service was excellent but the food lacked taste and ingredients
5
Literally the best thing I have done in a long time. I almost cried. I am a very busy traveller and sometimes I don't get the food or nutrients I need. My body goes through all kinds of withdrawals. I found AfterGlow by mistake and my body got enough nourishment for a month. Okay I know that's not a thing but that's how I felt. Everything is super fresh and clean and most of all , extremely delicious !!!! There is also a really good variety of dishes and the portions sizes are amazing ! They have really nice gifts for sale as well. The staff was amazing !They could stand to fix up the bathroom or build another one and put some air freshener. Spot is cute , creative , cozy and clean.

With the 1 for 1 promo on entertainer app, I ordered the Deconstructed sushi bowl, Quinoa and spinach "hashbrown" burger for the mains. The portion was pretty small so we had 2 other desserts as well- Acai bowl and the raw chocolate salted caramel fudge cake. The cake was a tad sweet for my liking but I adore the smooth, creamy and melt-in-the mouth texture of the chocolate mousse. The acai bowl comes with 2 scoops of acai sorbet served with a medley of nuts, granolas, dried fruits and dehydrated coconut crackers on a bed of banana slices. The acai sorbet was icy and refreshing but the coconut 'crackers' were sticky and much effort was needed to slice them apart with your jaws and hence we gave up >< Had seen some online pictures were there were fudge brownie cubes present but ours had none :( As for the main courses, I preferred the deconstructed sushi rice bowl with its substantial portion and the tangy wasabi dressing! The burger came with lettuce as the "bun", along with a crumbly patty made from quinoa and served alongside sweet potato wedges and side salad. Decent and not too bad but the portion was definitely insufficient for a filling meal. Quality of food is certainly not compromised here but if only the serving portion could be more generous...
4
My friend and I ordered 1 appetiser and 2 mains and we loved our dinner!For our starter, we had the nut cheese with crackers--the first time both of us were trying nut cheese and though this may not be for everyone we both enjoyed it. Not too sure what crackers they were but there were two kinds, one sweet and one savoury. For mains, he got the raw lasagne whilst I had the zucchini with walnut-date meatballs. Both dishes were very flavourful and satisfying. I especially loved the substantial walnut-date "meatballs". Neither of us is vegan but the food was a great intro to serious yet non-intimidating vegan food.Service was attentive and unobtrusive, our glasses were frequently filled with water by the friendly waitress.Prices are slightly on the high side for a cafe but given the quality of ingredients and niche they have, it is definitely not unreasonabl
5
food is unique and taste great. friends enjoyed it very much. comes in a variety of hot and cold dishes. so it's alright if u are not used to raw food.
4
The vermicelli spring roll appetiser is refreshingly yummy till I only focus on eating and forgot the name of the dish..😀
4
Vegan food at Afterglow is unique, with interesting presentation and very agreeable taste. Service is very friendly too. A very good place to hang out with family and friends.
5
I enjoyed a fabulous lunch at Afterglow set in the stunning historical location of Keong Saik Road. The menu is very creative and the chefs are so talented to bring the best of vegan food to the table. The set lunch is great value for a healthy lunch bursting with multiple flavors via a selection of soup and salads. You cannot skip dessert either and thankfully they serve great coffee with Common Man beans
3
My friend and I came here with high hopes after perusing the online menu.We came away feeling that the food was average at best.Enjoyed the deconstructed sushi bowl with the wholesome brown rice, however the wasabi was choking at times for us.The acai bowl was great as well, but expense at $15 per pop.
4
Beautiful area near china town in singapore! If you are raw or -not must visit this tasty rawsome cuisine,amazing sushi rolls with almonds instead of rice and more yummy, great choices for vegans as well, cozy place, nice staff and great service, they have some healthy products to purchase as wellYou can choose the special of the day,good variety.The only missing choice was almond or coconut milk for the coffe as they have barista would ve been nice to have one with the raw cheesecake but they only had soy milk or regular skimmed milk.Prices are a bit high but worth it
3
Came here for lunch today and opted for one of the "burgers". This was very tasty but was unfortunately quite a small serving so I ended up having to go somewhere else for another meal to address that. Service was friendly and efficient. My lunch partner did better with his choice: the zucchini linguini was a much bigger allocation
4
Located in great place near china town, nice vibe street. We had a wonderful evening starting with this cafe. Their guacamole starter and salad was amazing - magnificent raw crackers! The pizza was less good in our taste. Prices are very high and the dishes are small, but the vibe and taste compensate. The service was welcoming. Tip : you can start on finish you meal with a great Dorian at a only Fresh Durian shop just at the end of the road (China Town direction). You find there a large range of durians you can try and taste.
5
I went there twice a day during my week long trip to Singapore. Loved the food and they also do takeaway and delivery through a convenient app called foodpanda. Used it a lot to have their food delivered to my hostel. The rae salted caramel cake was one of the best I've ever tried!
4
As a self-professed meat lover, I was a bit concerned about going to a vegan restaurant for dinner. But I decided to be a bit daring and try it out and see how it goes (worse case scenario, have a meaty supper).In the end, I was pleasantly surprised. The pumpkin soup was rich and delicious and I had the hashbrown burger - which was a lettuce bun - but it was so good! I finished my burger really quickly! It came with a side of sweet potato fries and it made me pretty full quite fast.All in all, a good dinner. Besides a decadent dessert at another location, I didn't have to eat anything else
5
Probably the best and bubbly service staff I met this year. The 2 service staff on Friday (5Aug) evening shift were attentive efficient and all smiley on a hectic friday night. Kudos to them!
4
Food was fresh & their pizza was very tasty.I would definitely go back for more in the near future. Thanks
5
I was a bit apprehensive about the food, but it turned out to be tastier and more flavorful than I expected. Will definitely recommend to visit
4
had a lovely healthy lunch here, reminded me of Melbourne cafes. Expensive but not ridiculous. enjoyed the decor and vibe, as well as my vegan burger
4
A little pricey, loads of nuts and zucchinis, absolutely love the pizza Bases, crackers, cheese dip, desserts are OK. Went for nasi lemak later, could have stayed all day!
3
Afterglow is a quiet place amidst the busy Keong Saik area. The atmosphere was cozy. However, I can't say much about the food. I'm mostly vegetarian but I did not think the food was that great. The serving size was also too small especially for guys. Maybe we chose the wrong dishes but I don't see myself coming back again anytime soon
4
The food was well presented and inventive. I took a meat eater and he loved it! It is fairly pricey but it's a cool place to hang out and you would pay the same in other cities. Disappointed that a few things on the menu had sold out especially as the menu is so limited. Definitely worth a visit though!
3
Came here with two friends for dinner. We tried their burgers, one on the usual menu and the other on the special menu. Both were crumbly and quite bland, a far cry from the vegan fare I had in Sydney in cafes with a similar concept. Prices were on the high side given the portions and taste. The beetroot ginger late was a looker and rather smooth and delicious. My favourite thing that night was the acai bowl at $15. It tastes very acai-y, even more so than the ones I had overseas. If you had to come here this would be one of the items worth trying.
4
I’ve been here twice and have always left full and satisfied. This time around, I started with the pink hummus, followed by the Cuban wildrice burger and the acai bowl for dessert. All this plus a glass of their house red wine totaled SGD70.50—not cheap for vegan dining, but I'm willing to pay extra for high-quality ingredients and eating healthy over bargain basement local meals in Singapore. Good places are hard to find. If you’re looking for a healthy vegan alternative with a lovely cozy ambiance, check this place out amidst the shophouse architecture of quaint Keong Saik Rd
3
Maybe it's because I've been a vegan for quite some time and I've eaten a lot of good vegan food for an affordable price, but I really think the food here is too expensive for what it's worth. The deconstructed sushi bowl is a disappointment - I can make something like that at home too: it's just brown/red rice, with half an avocado and some pickles and seaweed and a side of wasabi sauce. The raw crackers with cashew nut cheese is pretty good but a small quantity for that price. The acai bowl (seasonal menu) is delicious but I could get better at Project Acai (and much more too), plus it's not even a 'bowl' it's just two scoops of acai sorbet. We also got the raw caramel chocolate fudge, which is raved about by everyone. I think it's yummy and well done but my friend couldn't eat a second spoon because it's too sweet. We both agree, however, that that tiny slice of cake isn't worth $12.50++, and for raw cakes Living Cafe does it better and at half the price. In conclusion, I'm probably not going to come back here again. It's a good experience though, if you're new to vegan/vegetarianism this is an interesting concept
3
Interesting pricey vegan meals we had for lunch on Saturday. A small place with friendly service. Food was just average. Small portions. From all we had yesterday, the best was the crispy lasagna. Saigon roll was quite good too.
3
celebrated my birthday here. upset that the vietnamese wraps went soggy really quickly. (it costs about $22 for 2 wraps)
would't try that again..
on another note, the juices were fresh & loved the sweet potato fries!
5
For every food item we ordered, the waiter would patiently explain how it was made without us even asking.
4
Enjoy the food, service and atmosphere so much.but the price a bit high, easy to find the restaurant.
4
If you are into raw food then this is the place to go. They make nice dessert and fresh food. The juice was quite nice too. The restaurant is quite cozy
4
My young man has fallen in love with the awesome vegan raw food at Afterglow and he brought me there. Co-incidentally, Keong Saik Carnival is on May 28, the area is simply vibrant. It reminds me of the Rocks Market in Sydney and Portobello Road Market in London. I love places with aesthetic appeal and the ambience today at this hip eatery was simply awesome for alfresco dinning. Quinoa Bowl @ S$16+ that I ordered was crisp and fresh and with its unique exciting tasty natural flavours. Simply love it. The Raw Lasagne @ S$22+ that my young man had was wholesome and delicious
4
I loved the creative vegetarian menu, the large selection of interesting beers, attentive but not pushy service.If you must have animal protein, skip this!As I wasn't too hungry- I stuck with tried and true items of sweet potato and separate dish of avocado- the chilli sauce was very good.I'll be bac
5
My husband and I are always looking for a nice, fun, restaurant for a night out. We found that in AfterGlow! Terrific (vegan/veg) food in a quaint setting. The menu changes regularly, and everything we ordered tasted great. Service was nice, too. And the prices weren't "that" bad for Singapore (one lg beer, one ale, an appetizer, soup, two mains and a dessert for 130 SGD) All in all, we would not hesitate to recommend this to others
5
Went there on a Friday night. The menu is not huge but has a good variety of options. We had several dishes and the taste was excellent. The portion of some dishes are small, others large it just depends. I would suggest reservations as the venue is not large. Staff was very helpful
5
Found this place by doing a search on vegan restaurants. What a find! I had a lovely cold pressed juice which was followed by Cuban Wildrice Burger and sweet potato fries. To top the meal off I had an organic salted caramel chocolate slice that was to die for. Service was very quick, and I was so glad to come across such a healthy place
5
I really liked their 'deconstructed dishes'. A creative and tasty menu in a cosy setting. It was a nice experience.
3
Had kimchi sushi, burger and mushroom soup. The burger was the tastiest dish - the soup and the sushi were ok, nothing exceptional. Overall a good option for vegetarian and vegans.
5
A must try for anyone, vegetarian or not, who enjoy good fresh, healthy, clean food. The dishes were a "gourmet" delight, the service was friendly and the prices extremely reasonable.
5
Just tried the juice and the guacamole, but it was absolutely perfect. The vibe in the cafe is super chill and the service very attentive ;)
3
My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for dinner and the food was okay. I had a reconstructed sushi bowl, with wasabi mayo which was very interesting but a little too much the further you got down the bowl. We were both really looking forward to some of the raw choices, but most were unavailable and were unable to try them. The raw desserts however we quite tasty and a nice addition the meal. The waiter also let us keep the glass bottles from our juices, which we liked. Unfortunately for the price, I would say this restaurant really isn't worth it. It definitely doesn't challenge the amazing raw treats that you get in the likes of Thailand and Bali and is triple the price
5
Afterglow is an intimate setting to enjoy some inventive, but delicious and healthy food. We enjoyed the set lunch with a full bowl of soup and a generous sized salad full of fresh and interesting flavors. We also loved the avocado cheesecake for dessert! A bonus of Afterglow is they serve Common Man coffee and they know how to make a good cup! We left the restaurant glowing! The staff were very friendly and helpful explaining the menu
4
We had the potato garlic sprout soup, zucchini lasagna, mushroom feta cheese burger and saigon rolls. They were all delicious! We thought we would still be hungry but the portions were great! Great service too, our server kept topping up our water and apologized for the momentary power failure.All in all, great experience! I should return for desserts next time
5
We came for lunch as our hotel was on the same road. If you are into healthy and delicious food this is the place! Delicious pressed juices, raw Vietnamese rolls for appetisers and zucchini pasta were divine! But the real winner was the raw chocolate salted caramel fudge cake omg!!!! The staff were so friendly and attentive. Wish we had seen this earlier!!
4
This is a vegan/vegetarian restaurant that serves its food raw or cooked below 47 degrees Celsius. I read about the benefits of this and decided to give the place a try. The raw lasagne, made up of layers of zucchini, fermented nuts and other goodies was nice and light. Although it was $20 and listed as a main, I felt like I had just eaten an appetizer. I then went for the chocolate fudge dessert ($12.50). I was hoping for something less sweet, more dark chocolatish, but it was still on the sweeter side. Not cloying, but enough to make you feel you've had enough sugar for the day (I think they use honey). Drinks here are very very expensive. Decided not to try. Not a bad place but not cheap either.
5
It was our first time at this place. We booked for a large group of 6 adults and 3 children below 12. The ambience was nice and decor was pretty cool. The staff are very warm and helpful in recommending dishes. Even the chef and sous chef were very pleasant and took the time to chat to my kids and show how the healthy food was prepared. The chips and various vegan cheese, guacamole and macadamia hummus appetisers were gone in a jiffy, my kids really loved the appetisers.The mushroom truffle soup was really tasty and delicious. Appreciated them trying add honey sun flower seeds to the salad to entice my 7-year-old son as it was his first vegan, raw food experience. The food was very good, large portions for the soups and salads. The burgers were a little small in portion but very yummy. Appreciated the staff accommodating our special request to bring a vegan, raw food cake for the birthday girl in our party. Will definitely come again to try the desserts served at this place another time
4
I'm a fan of the raw movement and the fresh juices that they serve. Not cheap though! Courteous staff and place is dog-friendly (outdoor seating).
5
friendly staff, inspiring raw food snd atmosphere.. each time i go with friends or family we end up chatting away, vibrating at a higher frequency ;-)
3
Five of us had soup and salad, two of us had dessert, all vegan, and a total of three beers. No meat, dairy or bread in sight. The bill came to $300. Talk about the Emperor's new clothes.... I left needing a burger.
3
Food was great but portion a little small, making it a tad too expensive. Sadly most items were sold out for dinner that day, citing that they did not expect a lunch crowd. But I thought they could have time to replenish for dinner. Also, i made a RSVP (via CHOPE) a week prior saying it was for a birthday celebration but it was not noted.
5
I must confess I was surprised to find such a great raw food restaurant in Singapore, surprised to find any raw food restaurant in Singapore, in fact! My sister and I went for lunch when we were both pretty hungry. She had the raw lasagne and I had the raw taco bowl. In her dish, courgette slices substituted for pasta and in mine, lettuce leaves took the place of taco shells. This is a vegan restaurant, so there was no meat or dairy, but neither dish suffered from this, in fact they were much the fresher and better for it. We had planned to sample the raw banana cheesecake for desert, but when it came to it, we were both too full
3
Went there just a few hours ago, decided to go there because of all the great reviews I found online. Service was great, the place was nice too (the area around the restaurant is also fantastic). However, despite the great reviews, my main course was just ok. I ordered the raw taco bowl, which came out to be bigger than I expected, i don't think it's something that I'd order again. Fortunately, I also ordered the raw guacamole dip with crackers, which tasted really good!!! In short, I think I have to visit again to try out more of their food, I don't think my salad does them justice :-
5
I'm not vegan, but a good friend is, and you'd be surprised how hard it is to find restaurants I think will be equally yummy for both of us. While there are some good veg options in the city, ambiance is often lacking. Afterglow has great food and atmosphere. Service is really good too. I've been here a few times and always enjoy myself
5
We had a really outstanding experience here. The dishes we would recommend highly are  Guacamole Dip, Clear Tom Yum Soup, Raw Lasagne ( my raw zucchini linguine was just OK) and the Blueberry Cheesecake. The raw chocolate caramel was good, perhaps very good but not great. The French wine a 2009 Clarendelle Dillon was excellent. Alcohol is expensive in Singapore, so eating out can be costly especially is you like wine. The total bill, including service charge( no need to add an additional tip) was $170 (US) so more than we like to spend. The wine was $80. However we feel it was worth it and would definitely return. The same wine would be no more than $25 in France

New friends at the Palm Avenue Float Center (also recommended!) suggested that I go here for a meal, and I was not disappointed. It was late, so I only ordered small dishes -- raw crackers and dip, and a soup. Brilliant. The crackers and dip plate were the equal of the best I've had in Los Angeles, and the mushroom soup (warm but not hot, to preserve the enzymes) is likely the best I've ever had, anywhere. It was one of those dishes that was so good, I wanted it to never end. ;) Service was kind and *very* attentive; an unusual and very welcome experience for me in Singapore. Yes, it's pricey; and, it's worth it. Recommended.

Thank you for creating this lovely little place. The options for Raw and Vegan in Singapore are so limited and I don't know if many have truly grabbed this concept really well, in my opinion. Yet, I can confidently say, Afterglow certainly have! Nut cheese with sundried tomato and olive, was incredible. The mushroom soup, with truffle oil is to die for. The deconstructed Sushi, I could have licked the bowl ( I think I kinda did) and the salted caramel dessert.... emmmm-hmmmmm. YUMMINESS. The staff are fab. The red juice did the trick (super good for the insides) and I left feeling incredibly warm and fuzzy! Top job guys! Love your work. I will sleep like a baby tonight
