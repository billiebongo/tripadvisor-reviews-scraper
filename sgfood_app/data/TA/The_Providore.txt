Hoping for a great burger but it‚Äôs really not worth the $28.50++, no bacon and soggy fries. Very disappointing.
3
Club sandwich was nice. However, we‚Äôre 30 minutes waiting for them to settle the bill and still waiting. A pitiful excuse for customer service... Not the quick bite you‚Äôre hoping for when doing an afternoons shopping.
3
The coffee served is very average and the poached eggs were extremely sad. I was not impressed at all.
1
Flies is too small for that kinda price and the taste is just nothing fantastic. The rest of food taste is so so. Not worth the money spent.
4
Sausage n bacon tastes marvellous, accompanied with a cup of hot latte.
They sell a lot of different kinds of cheeses, bread and wine. Also ice cream! Service is so so. Quite pricey though... for you who love western bfast may try this place.

After weeks of drinking terrible coffee while travelling, this was a treat. While on a shopping expedition with a teenager, The Providore provided a break and a great coffee hit. It cost $5.50SD for a small coffee but it was excellent. Seems to be chain.
3
The food at the providore was nice; I had the crab linguine which was $26 which I felt was slightly overpriced ($31 when service charge is added) for a dish that was nice but not fantastic. The original hot chocolate ($8) I had was average- but it was interesting that cafe has different types of hot chocolate (E.g. white chocolate, chocolate with chili) so maybe it was just that the type of hot chocolate I ordered wasn't as good as the other versions.  The service wasn't fantastic as most of the servers were pretty curt and unfriendly, but the waiter at the cashier was nice and offered to help split the bill for my friend and I. The cafe also has free wifi so that was helpful
1
I don‚Äôt get it ... you are doing all the dishes and breakfast fresh, supposingly. When I ask for avocado on toast but without the cheese coming with it ... why will I get a response of ‚Äûwe can‚Äôt change it for you!‚Äú? Incredibly customer unfriendly... but asking SGD 18.50 for it. Disappointed! And even the lowest review is still too much for you guys.
3
Food was good well presented but took +40min to get an eggs Benedict and a salad from the menu. We also ordered a baguette with ham and cheese for our kid, out of the menu, this took 50min... I think there is a margin of improvements
2
We did not dine here (thankfully). We simply wanted some bread to go. The woman (looked Filipino) behind the cashiers counter looked stern and unsmiling. Maybe she had a bad day but that's no reason to take out the piss poor attitude on paying customers. She barely acknowledged the order (2 loaves costing $15); did not smile; did not say thank you after receiving the money. Hey, the bread is not free but smiles are.Then, another colleague asked if we wanted the loaves sliced. We did, but when she heard this, she went off grudgingly to slice them. Why bother to ask in the first place?Not impressed by the piss poor attitude. Will not return. Ever.
4
We only had a drink here so can't comment on the food.If you can get a seat on the terrace that sits above Orchard Rd,then it's a great place to watch the world go by.
4
Extremely friendly and welcoming staff (Thanks Azalea) This would have to be the best coffee in Singapore... Strong ..full flavour...great hot oi cold... Recommended after a hard days shopping ....
3
Came here for a coffee after lunch in the vicinity last week. Service was efficient and the coffee was good but not exceptional. Decent atmosphere. Pricing a little high but to be expected given the rent in this location.
5
I visit approximately twice a month and the food is always good and the service friendly most of the time .
Love their avo sandwiches üëç Great coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.A seriously good place for breakfast , especially The Ricotta pancakes- huge portions .Enough for two .
4
I went with a friend for a brunch. My friend ordered the fresh fruit salad, which come very good in color arrangement, and she said it tastes refreshing and good. I ordered the English breakfast and the waiter and chef had been kind to offer substitute for the pork sausage with additional mushroom, or additional tomato, spinach. I choose to have additional mushroom and spinach. There is also various kind of earl grey tea - jasmine earl grey, musk earl grey, french earl grey, classic earl grey - we decided to stick with the classic one :) The place is nice for taking instagramable photo and for having a good chat with a friend
4
We decided to give this place a try based on TripAdvisor recommendations and were generally fairly happy. Good sandwiches, good coffee, efficient staff, nice ambiance for what it was. We did find it a little difficult to find; it's on the fourth floor of the tower behind the Mandarin Orchard Hotel
5
This was the best coffee in Singapore. So happy to have stumbled across this cafe. The only place I found almond milk. I had an almond croissant with my coffee and it was probably the best one I‚Äôve had outside of France. The service was good and attentive. Food looked amazing but we‚Äôd already had lunch
3
Had a Sunday brunch here. Unsure why they offered us the bar like area with high stools looking out the window when lots of tables for two were available. And when we asked, they just allowed us to choose any table we wanted.My friend had pancakes and I had a pasta dish. It all tasted ok but the service staff seemed to want to hurry things along and came very quickly to take our order and when we were barely finished they wanted to take it all away.
4
Undoubtedly the best chai latte one can have in town, and maybe Singapore.Desserts here are usually very good, albeit priced higher than most casual cafes. Plate of a brunch dish I had one time was too sparse - I remember thinking it definitely needed more things on the plate, eg side salad or other side of some sort.Don't remember if they do a charcuterie/cheese platter, but given the deli store, they should definitely offer one at an attractive price
1
Seated 15 mins, managed to called two servers, they asked me to wait, wait another 10 mins, no one even bother to come back or approached me if i have order. i saw 4 of them just walk here and there, act busy? Managed to grab the attention of the server i called earlier, he gave me a face that he is pissed off! What kind of service standard is this? I m here now 9 Sept, 3:04 PM, perhaps the management should check whats going on.
4
After way too many bad coffees in Singapore this place was a standout. Good food, very corporate, fast service, a few language challenges but overall a very good experience and would happily return.
4
I am a coffee snob from australia and love my well roasted poured and creamered long black. This cafe is the place when you need your fix when in Singapore
And the take away cheese plater fir afternoon tea in the hotel was really good
1
Was at the Providore Caf√© at Tangs and was looking to buy chocolate bars. Found that they were past the use-by dates by more than a month!!!
4
What I like about this place is the location and atmosphere. The mall it's in is generally quiet and I like that. The place has a nice overall vibe with outdoor seating overlooking Orchard Road.I love it best when I visit on a weekday afternoon when it's quietest and not crowded
4
We were at The Providore Downtown for a weekend brunch. The ambiance is cozy and warm, and their store has interesting stuff.We got the Spanish Baked Eggs, Smashed Avocado Toast, Pistachio-Raspberry Mousse, Mocha, & an Iced Latte. The food was well made and tasted fresh. The mousse was absolutely melt-in-the-mouth delectable. The coffee though was quite terrible. The milk in the latte was curdled - it was instantly replaced but the next one didn't make an impression either.The food and service, definite thumbs up (though as with most brunch places, overpriced for the portions). The coffee needs a ton of work
4
Went for the high tea set at 12noon on Sunday, quite a satisfactory experience though I expected better quality for the sweet items. The toasted white bread sandwiches with various ham, cheese and cucumber fillings were tasty but the tarts with cheese, cream and cut fruit fillings were not subtle in their tastes despite the high price of $27.50 per tea set. The pastry shells were hard, the fillings too sweet and the scones nowhere near a Devonshire cream tea standard, the slice of dark fruit cake passable.You could choose your coffee, a generous Regular size and our Cappuccinos were good, no complaints.Service was friendly and obliging and water was served immediately we arrived.Must say the side seats with more comfortable backing weren't ideal for chatting as tables are quite close to each other and we heard every snatched of our neighbors ' conversation so had to move to a smaller centre table, hardly adequate for the three-tier silver set, serving plates and coffee cups.Expected more luxury and finesse for the price tab
1
We went to providore this morning with my wife and kids. We order different type of food, ranging from coffees, eggs Benedict, scones, croissant and the so called breakfast board.First of all the service was extremely slow, it took around 15 min to get the coffee and half an hour to get the food.As we weren't in a rush we decided to stay...bad decision!I'm writing this review from hospital as the doctor has just confirmed my wife is food poisoned...most likely the eggs or something else. It is confirmed that it was breakfast as she was absolutely fine and she didn't eat anything else After that.My recommendation is to avoid this place...I'm sure nobody wants to go though this experience..
4
Very good coffee. I am a repeated patron of it. I have an enjoyable every time I patron the cafe. They have the best coffee in Singapore and definitely better than overpricing, overly sweet, watered down caffeine of a certain green franchise that students love to gather in. This is more price worthy. Awesome ambiances, friendly professional staff able to get orders right and allow for minor customizations. Different outlets seems to have slight adjustment to the menu. Overall an indeed hipster with sounding qualities
1
Decided to try out Providore in Mandarin gallery for all the hype surrounding it. Started off poorly, me and my daughter had to wait for about 10 minutes while various members of staff just walked past us and didn't even acknowledge our presence in a restaurant that was not packed. Finally after being seated (after i asked the staff), we ordered what on the menu sounded delicious ..Ricotta Pancakes ($17.50). When the pancakes arrived i was in shock as they did not look like pancakes, as my 3 year old asked "is it bread". What does a 3 year old know? So i started eating it and low and behold, it looked like bread and was the driest pancakes i had ever had, i complained and apparently this is the quality of the ricotta pancakes. All i can say is the chef needs to get a new recipe (Bill Grangers recipe is amazing).All in all, i felt this restaurant is over hyped, i would suggest to just stick to the amazing cafe upstairs where the quality of food is well worth the wait
2
Decent food let down by appalling service. A minor seating issue mishandled lead to a difficult conversation with the "manager" who exhibited no EQ (or frankly, IQ). If I owned the place I'd start by sacking him.A good post script is that the atmosphere & service at wild honey (upstairs) were far bette
4
Our stop was actually at the Providore in Tans department store. Second floor spot is very nice for lunch or a snack while shopping. Good service and good food.
4
I visited here a few times recently, it was the best coffee I drank in Singapore (I ordered flat whites!). The staff were friendly and helpful. I would definitely return.
1
I went with a friend of mine to grab some breakfast , and we saw this place which looked really cool and pleasant.We took a sit, I ordered some poached eggs on toast with avocado on the side , the waitress came with the dishes. First of all the 2 poached eggs were way overcooked, they were actually boiled inside,and secondly, the slices of avocado were not ripped at all, they were hard . I asked the waitress if I can get another avocado ripped this time, she came back with another portion of avocado , I tried .... same^^. The manager came and told me i'm sorry but the avocados are not good today and no one is ripped ...She asked me if she can get me something instead, like salmon or mushrooms...I said ok some salmon will be fine.Anyway she came back few minutes later with the salmon , I ate my dish because I was so hungry but it was not good at all, I mean for the price you paid , the quality of the food is way too overpriced.I was really disappointed by the food and the service, they gave us the bill, I looked at it and I saw they charged me 9.75 $ for the salmon.. ( the avocado was 5.5 $ ) So I paid 22.5$ instead of 18$ for something that I didn't really wanted and which was not tasty at all. I went to the counter and paid, no apologize not even a goodbye.NEVER AGAIN !
2
Good ambience; but food & service not in line with high prices. Under staffed and long wait time to order on the crowded weekend morning we visited. Both the mains we ordered sounded nice on paper; but were just passable in composition and flavor. At these prices, one expects more. Singapore restaurants need to be careful. Just good decor and process cannot make up for deficits in a real mastery of the subject. Overall - not a great experience; doubt if we will return
4
We had the lobster mac and cheese and the club sandwich. Both were good. Coffee is good too and so was the raspberry something mousse. Bought a baguette, the olive bread, some cheese and chorizo. All were great. Servers were attentive despite many negative comments on it and we were there at lunch. Prices were reasonable to us, it's the price of eating out in Singapore and in a cafe on Orchard Road.
5
Located in the Mandarin Gallery in the heart of Orchard Road, the Providore is a neat little getaway in the midst of all the noise and hustle of the street below. We found it by accident one day and have been returning ever since! The restaurant has a choice of inside or outside seating which is nice depending on your mood. Try the grass-fed beef burger..delish! The wine is the standard "1 for 1" deal so you could drop by for drinks after shopping or a casual bite in the evening
2
Service is horrible, no one seem to be happy to work here. Food is actually not too bad, just forever to serve simple dish (it is not even busy yet). The only good thing is that the location is easy when you need to grab something fast in the centre
3
Good service but food is soso. Ordered salmon rosti, rosti was hard and overcooked. Came again second time and ordered fries and again its overcooked. Chefs obviously dun care about the food they serve to guests! I call it them cook not really chefsLuckily coffee was gd if not i would not recommend this plc
2
The place is quite busy. We have not found the great food that we like. Things just average. Mushroom soup of the day bit tasteless from mushroom taste. Crispy calamari salad is so so, the calamari is far from crispy. Vege sandwich is too sour.Pan seared ocean trout is served with strange rice.But the espresso n mocha sandwich biscuit are good.
4
I gave 4 stars simply because of the perfect location and that it opens early for brunch.They sell some pretty good quality cheese and processed meat. Food looks and tastes good but pretty pricey. It still worth to visit though! Sit outside to feel the Breeze of Orchard road and watch people without being watched back! (Since it's on the upper level)
3
Double shot latte quite good. Scones not recommended. Atmosphere comfortable suitable for small group.
4
My first visit and impressed by the food. Service is ok and it's a small quiet place inside a hotel shopping complex.
3
This is not a bad place, but whatever I've had there, it looks really good, but the taste is so-so. I like the service and location, internet is good,however, I am not sure I would go back...
3
Ok sandwich and smoothie - bread was of good quality but overall taste was rather bland.
Has a terrasse overlooking orchard road, which is nice.
2
Nice location, food good but extremely poor service. I ordered toast which took 20 minutes to arrive despite their being nearly no one else in the place. Also no skinny milk for coffee.
4
Been looking for great coffee in Singapore for some time . I would rate the coffee as good as what you get in Melbourne or Sydney. Yeah the service was average you get that when a place is full.
4
Very nice food with a great selection for breakfast lovely place with Nice deco.
even a small terrasse on the side the perfect place for a lunch meeting bur service need some improvement
Nice Pick the Museli!

Mandarin Gallery branch - Very disappointed with the service standard and the service staff's inability to remember the orders correctly. I've been to this outlet twice over the last 3 weeks and both times the orders have been wrong and no action to ensure my dining experience was not compromised with all the screw ups.First visit on Jan 27 for lunch, the order was as follows - beef sandwich, medium on sourdough bread was bungled. And duck rilette with 2 coffees. Apologies was given for the steak sandwich and being the eve of Lunar New Year, we let this pass. Second visit on Feb 3 for lunch, the order was crab linguini and grass fed beef burger, medium cooked, and 2 skinny lattes. The orders was not punched in and had waited for more than 30 minutes. The beef burger order was bungled again. The service young lady ordered mac and cheese twice instead of beef burger. Was offered something while waiting for the correct order to come, by then I was getting more unhappy by the minute.Please train and ensure that your staffs are attentive and remember our orders as this is one of the vital points to ensure recurrence of patronage and good reviews to your branding. And the Caucasian manager was only interested in ensuring the Caucasian customers' welfare and orders were in place. She never came to talk to us to find out why we were unhappy nor did a service rescue.I give this outlet 2 stars, the food was good and well plated BUT the service failed miserably.
3
Came here for afternoon drinks during chinese new year so it wasn't too crowded. We sat outside on the high stools and it was a great spot above orchard road and to people watchThe prosecco and draft beer we had were okServive is robotic, nothing specia
5
They sell very good Sandwich Ice cream from Pat & Sticks of Australia. I love its sandwich Espresso lace and sandwich Mochacino lace ice cream. Im not keen at all about milk taste. And these don't have any milk taste for me love it a lot.
2
I had breakfast at the one in Mandarin Gallery, around 9.30. Food was so so, I order scramble egg and bread. Coffee was ok. Everything is ruined by the poor service. Waiters couldn't smile at all and was not attentive to customer.
5
Check the Providore at Raffles Place, in the mid of business area with glasses architecture, good place to start your day with good coffee. A must visit if you enjoy coffee with a view!
5
We were in town for a few days and needed a good coffee, was not let down ! Very good barista , food selection and quality was excellent. Great atmosphere and surroundings. I will be making it my regular when i am back in Singapore.
4
I am an experienced coffee drinker and I find the quality of the coffee at The Providore is very good. I highly recommend The Providore to all fellow coffee addicts.
4
Visited for brunch on a Saturday. The food was good, the coffee was fragrant and the server was delightful. Will definitely return to such comfortable and cheery ambience.
2
I went with my fiance in this restaurant at around 3pm on Sunday. The place was not too busy. We ordered crab linguine pasta and pappardelle pasta both priced at 25-28$. The fresh juice is 8.50$ while a glass of chablis costs 18$. After 20mins waiting,pasta finally arrived and tasted good but the servings were quite stingy. I asked for another glass of wine but after 15mins of waiting, we just decided to ask for the bill. When the bill came we noticed the breakdown of prices were not the same on the menu. The waitress explained that the prices on menu does not include gst. Haya! If you're willing to pay 90$ for 2pasta dishes and 2drinks go ahead..Amazing
3
Went to the one at Tangs Plaza. The crab linguini was most tasty and the scones were good, though served with butter instead of clotted cream. Service is rather disappointing, considering the prices they charge. We needed to request for basic things like utensils when the food is served. What was nice, though, is that we could sit and talk for hours without being pressured to vacate our table.
2
Couple breakfast. Solid coffee and sweet orange juice. Coffee shop looks great. Staff are friendly and attentive. However the dish I had was barren. E.g. Just eggs and toast on a plate. Nothing more. Not a single piece of garnishing. Not what I would expect given the price point. Seems well suited for business meetings over coffee.
4
I recently ate breakfast at this restaurant and was impressed. The service was attentive and food was delicious. I had the eggs Benedict and my partner had the breakfast board. The menu and style were very reminiscent of the type of cafe's we're used to back home in Australia. Will be back again
5
We had a quick coffee break ib the afternoon after walking around Orchard Rd. This place serves very good coffee. Though our latte was not that hot. We had some bread and tart tk go with it. This place had a queue which means, tbey serve good food. It was indeed very good. The Key Lime tarte was great! For aure we would go back here in the future
4
Popped in for a quick lunch. Had the steak sandwich, which was very good. Like most restaurants in Singapore, it's not cheap, but a very good lunch and by Singaporean standards, reasonable value.
3
Visited the outlet at Raffles Place during lunch time to celebrate friend's birthday. The food tasted average. Fries were average too. Find it a bit overpriced. Not really worth it.
4
This cafe with deli vibe, serves great coffees and desserts. Bright & Casual: this is my favorite place for a caffeine fix or an informal catchup, in between appointments/shopping along Orchard road.
4
Had breakfast here on a rainy Singapore Sunday morning. Very good selection of western style breakfast with a good coffee.
Service was friendly, food was great. Good location in busy Orchard road district.
4
The food was awesome. My Chicken Quinoa salad was visually stunning. The taste was heavenly for Salad lovers and green eaters. The mac and lobster for my son was a 2 thumbs up for my son. Normally he just like's Jamie's Italian in Orchard which serves great food. But he also likes this now. My son likes the place too because of the view of the Orchard road. We were seated outside which was a great choice as we've been inside the mall for too long.the ice cream Sandwich was alright. Simple. The cakes looks sinful but my son choose the Ice cream instead. I could have chosen the cake. The service was good although they should prepare a staff outside to assist those in that area. Still it was good. They are very helpful with whats in the menu. They know their food and they were polite and all smiles. One thing that they should add maybe is a kids meal just like in Jamie's Italian where kids can enjoy the dining experience with their parents and family. Should consider maybe putting an all day breakfast daily not just on a weekend which I want to try next with their coffee as it looks great from the other table. I will also try their mojito next as this is a favorite. So far I like Dimbulah's mojito @ Chijmes. Overall, the food and service experience was great. I do recommend this place to all my family and friends. My son gives this a 2 thumbs up. We will surely come back
4
We stumbled across this restaurant after we caught the train from Changi Airport to Raffles Place. It's a nice modern place, very busy and quite noisy inside. We had the Eggs Benedict and they were pricey for the serving size. Coffee was good. Service was excellent.
4
To start the cappuccino was excellent. The menu is more diverse than it would appear from just walking by. My first impression was that it was only an artisanal bakery. I'm glad I stopped to view the menu. I had the baked Spanish eggs, and it was very good. The service was good and quick. Give it a try
4
Somehow the espresso blend with the icecream was just simply delicious. Ten of us went to The Providore on Raffles Place on a Saturday late afternoon, but the place was full. With ten of us ordering sandwiches, drinks, coffee, cakes throughout the few hours we were there, the staff was always smiling, gracious and helpful.I also had the Salmon Sandwich. Great salad side too. Lovely little cafe.
4
We had breakfast at this pleasant spot on the first floor of Tangs Department Store. We'd been here on a previous holiday and enjoyed the fact it was a quiet setting, unlike many cafes in Singapore. The prices were high, but the quality was there. The coffee was made as we'd requested - I prefer a double shot and that was not a problem. The only problem was that I wanted a muffin - I remembered that they were very nice. The problem was that they don't arrive until an hour or so after the caf√© opens! It seemed rather strange to my mind, a caf√© open for business but minus an item. The menu is very small and there is not a lot of variety available. However, I was happy with my cup of coffee, and my husband enjoyed his savoury dish.On a previous visit, we'd visited a Providore Caf√© further along Orchard Road - with an escalator rising from street level. It was horribly busy: the caf√© in Tangs is far superior as it's always been relatively quiet when we've visited
2
We went for lunch and set down at their nice Raffles Place outlet. We almost walked out when we saw the prices on their menu but eventually decided to stay. And also decided to go for the burger at 28++ as it just must be something special at that price. Well, it was special but really not at all to my liking. It wasn't cooked medium rare as ordered but the beef was very tasty and that eventually wasn't the issue. The issue was that it was the oiliest burger I had in my life. Even the buns were oily. And the fries seemed to have soaked up a lot of oil as well. I coukdn't finish the burger, barely ate anything of the bun. Ok, it could be a matter of taste. But I really don't think so. Apart from that the service was good, people were friendly. Which is great but eventually I mainly paid for the food. Which I will probably do at some other place next time.
4
Loving the coffee and the ambience. As of dessert, it's not bad, but on the one that I've tried (rum something, sorry I forgot) it's probably not their best.
But I'll be back for sure to taste their gorgeous looking breakfast menu.
3
The Providor sits between some large financial institutions with the only grass for several hundred meters. Ideally located in the financial district and close to the MRT.You are paying to people watch and the food drinks are expensive when you look at the hundreds of other options within a few minutes walk. It is very popular though so they are doing it right.Foods good fresh and tasty. Staff are friendly and professional. Good selection of teas and coffees for sale
4
I did not eat so I can only give feedback on the coffee and setting. Providore is a well designed modern space with attentive staff. The coffee was good but not amazing, the ambience was good but I did find it a little noisy with poor acoustics. I would return but I am not sure I would go out of my way to get there unless I was passin
3
Wild Honey was full and Jones the Grocer was closed on a Sunday morning, so we went to The Providore at 9:30 am. We saw that the eggs Benedict were served with a round brioche bread, but brioche was not offered with anything else--all other dishes were accompanied by sourdough bread. My wife asked if toasted brioche bread could be substituted for sourdough, and the chef said it was not possible. If we had it to do over again, we simply would asked for eggs Benedict without the Hollandaise sauce which would have been exactly what my wife wanted. The coffee was served with cute ultra small cubes of white or brown sugar which was very convenient. We felt the tables were more close together than we would have liked, and the cost of the food was about the same as the bill for more elaborate dishes at Wild Honey. So the quality of food and service divided by cost came out at an average experience for us. That said, we noticed that usually people are queued to eat lunch there, so others really like it
3
Hunting for really great coffee on Orchard Road led me to this place, so I decided to stay and try the breakfast. The ambience is warm and inviting with a modern, cafe vibe. There are also outdoor tables if you want to brave the Singapore heat. The fresh-squeezed orange juice tasted great, and at SG$10, it better be! The well-presented Spanish baked eggs for SG$21.77 was piping hot and a little on the greasy side; too much melted cheese and not a whole lot of egg for my taste. The only great thing was the coffee. All this for a whopping total of SG$37.66 (incl. GST). I'd drink the coffee again, but skip the breakfast menu
5
Walked past here on a saturday morning, love that its one of the very few places in Orchard where u can sit outside and enjoy a great cup of coffee! We had breakfast...eggs benedict/florentine and my husband the bfast in a pan with tomato type sauce. It was delicious. Not huge portions...but taste was delicious and compared to the likes of Wild Honey...another one of our fav bfast spots! Cannot comment on anything else but the above and if u want a great spot on orchard this is it!
2
It looked like a fancy place to get some takeaway, but for $8.50 I got a small piece of baguette with chicken, avocado and a bland chipotle mayo. There was a ham and cheese sandwich for the same price that was bigger, though. Apparently sandwiches are generally surprisingly expensive in Singapore but this one really seemed pointless when you can get full food court meals for less
3
Space is quite nice. Coffee is pretty good. Ambience could be better with a speaker blaring in front corner, it was quite obtrusive to eating and really spoilt the experience. The bodum salt and pepper grinder needs explaining to guests as i noticed several tables of guests asking for instructions how it worked. Breakfast had to ask for butter for toast, scrambled eggs perfect, bacon was actually pancetta style. No Gluten free option for toast..
2
Great location, and a fair few drinks to choose from for a cafe style restaurant. My issue is with the price vs the quality and quantity of food you get. As a vegetarian, it is only too common in Singapore to be fobbed off by salad options, which in this place, sadly are your only real options. Settling for a salad at nearly $30++, I do expect the size to be enough to feed a person! Instead, I got 22 leaves of baby spinach, with 8 small cubes of butternut squash, with tonnes of oil as a dressing. If you're listening Providore, you need to fix your portion sizes and options for people who have special dietary requirements!
4
We were with our friend who lives in Singapore and she suggested the Provider as a easy place to grab a bite to eat. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table, ending up sitting at a counter facing out on the terrace. I ordered calamari salad, others a ham and cheese sandwich and a BLT. A side of french fries were ordered but sent back when we tasted them they were so greasy that you couldn't eat them. I suggested to the server that possibly the fryer wasn't hot enough. Need less to say they were taken of the bill. The servings were plenty for lunch and enjoyable
2
Went there to have lunch. Service is not so good and worst part after long wait ,which i didnt mind because i understand the Paella takes time to cook, but to serve raw food, just disappointing. Wont be coming back.
4
Busy cafe with the benefit of outdoor seating to watch over busy Orchard Road. Nice Food freshly cooked to order & presented attractively.
3
Fantastic coffee, perfect for a shopping break at Orchard Road. Great to bring mom here to chit chat and enjoy!
2
I had been to The Providore at Raffles Place a couple of times, twice on a Sunday which was good given most shops close around the area. Prices for the food was on the high side but would be justifiable if not for the super SMALL portions and so so taste. The paella tasted dry with little ingredients, so does the mac and cheese which was bland with hard pasta. The key lime tart had crust that was moist and soggy. The saving grace was perhaps the mochacinno which looked and tasted strong. Service needed to be improved upon as some of the staffs seemed unsure when asked about the food in the menu
5
Wow, the reviews weren't wrong! We were hanging out for a good coffee as our hotel did not seem to understand the meaning of a good coffee! We weren't disappointed, magnificent! We consider ourselves to be coffee snobs, and yes, go ahead and order your coffee at the Providore! What a funky cafe come casual eating house! The staff are wonderful and such a gorgeous place to sit, next time I look forward to actually dining here! The kids ordered a cake and a muffin and they were deliscious. The coffee: sublime!
4
Great location on Orchard Road, breakfast was lovely. Went back a few times and had the poached eggs and muesli - enjoyed both. Best coffee I have found in Singapore (on both visits to Singapore). Total breakfast cost was about $50 - little pricey - but enjoyed our breakfast and look forward to going back.

Came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Ordered Eggs Benedict & a latte. As the title suggest, I was really disappointed with the eggs Benedict. Firstly, the 'muffin' below the eggs was like a burger bun? It really tasted & looked like a burger bun, which I haven't seen in any eggs Benedict before. And they put so much hollandaise sauce on it that it is unbearable. The sauce itself is too salty and creamy so I had to remove most of it. So basically, the dish is just 2 poached eggs on a burger bun, some raw spinach, ham and some bad hollandaise sauce. Coffee was ok. Wifi connection was bad.

Dropped into Providore, Mandarin Gallery for an evening coffee with friends. Apart from being centrally located right on Orchard, the place appeared a cool hangout for an evening meet. We tried Affogato, Mixed juice of Apple, Blackberry & Mint together with some pastries, which tasted really delicious. The evening flew by as conversation was easy against the backdrop of bustling Orchard Rd evening rush hour on a Fri evening. Our overall experience was positive & there's no reason why we won't do it again while meeting some friends

I had a very terrible experience there when I had breakfast with my Friend. I ordered the pancake and it came raw as I can even taste bids of flour!! I paid around $20 for those pancakes. I did inform one of the service people and she just said "oh sorry." And can you believe it she just apologise and expect to finish my dish when I found that it wasn't cook properly!!??? I didn't finish it as few bites to it I can feel my stomach isn't feeling well!A very bad service and the worst kind of food I've eaten !! Be careful when you're there

I had brunch here with 3 other guests. We were greeted in a cordial manner and quickly shown to a table. Water was served whilst we mulled over the menus. There was a wide array of choices and something to interest everyone in our group. The food was moderately priced for Singapore and we all enjoyed our meals and drinks
4
Very tasty burger which was cooked perfectly (medium - rare). Nicely presented with lovely salad and sauce. Chips were ok but I always think it's just lazy to leave the skin on. Service was fine.
5
They do have best coffee and dessert in the town ,.....my all time favourite ice latte w salted caramel ice cream and banana macadamia cake.... and amazing service, mr.guna alway one step ahead and very friendly,......
3
coffee is good and great place to just sit down and relax, but sometimes crowded as they have a small place.
5
Best milkshake in my opinion, made with valrhona chocolate gelato. Hot chocolate was ok and latte was good. The scrambled eggs with sourdough toast was nice and according to my sister, the accompanying butter was really tasty. Ricotta pancakes with caramelised banana, walnuts and house brand sugar syrup was suitable for 2 girls to share as the 2 pieces of pancakes were so thick! The ambience was comfortable and service good
3
Located at the heart of Orchard road, the restaurant can be easily accessed from the external escalator which is located on the second floor. The breakfast menu is quite limited. We ordered an English breakfast (S$20) and a banana pancake. The breakfast set has egg. sausage, bacon, toast and grilled tomato. Except for the egg, the rest of of the items are not impressive. The coffee ($5 for cappuccino) is not as aromatic compared to those served at Tiong Bahru Bakery. The pancakes was served quite bare (refer to photo) they could have put a little more effort to 'beautify' it. But the pancakes taste good, it's slightly hard on the outside but very soft and moist inside.
5
We went there for dinner with a group of 8 friends, looking to try their signature Lobster Mac & Cheese (which was yummy). But we ended the meal by ordering 12 different desserts. Each one was delicious. There was something to suit everyone's liking. The coffee was excellent as well. We enjoyed Providore so much that we went to try their other branch in the Grandstand -- excellent too
4
My friends and I went to The Providore for brunch and we were not disappointed. I ordered breakfast blt and my friend ordered egg benedicts. We both love our food and piccolo latte is good too. A good place to chill out in the afternoon. I'll definitely coming back again :
3
The main course, roasted chicken is dry and hard. The beef patty of the burger has a weird taste. This is disappointing as I had brunch here some months back and I would have given it a 4 then but couple with this experience I would only give it a 3
4
Can't fault the food. Great taste. Love the sour dough bread n gruyere sauce. But disappointed in the small cup of coffee. Guess everywhere you pay more for a small cup. Didnt like the coffee as it turned quickly sour. You would think that the coffee would be hot in a small cup. I had to ask them to make a new one and there wasn't much of a difference. However the staff was nice about it. It wouldnt be fair to give the cafe an average rating as food is indeed good. So 4 points from me. That, should be fair.
4
We always come to the providers on weekends! Coffee is really good! Service sometimes slow, but it's worth the wait.My husband usually has a grilled chicken sandwich and it is really tasty. Good portion of chicken and not dry at all.The coffee is excellent
4
After having to que at a neighbouring breakfast venue, we were in search of an alternative. My thumbs up to a great meal to start the day. Service was quick and staff was helpful. And seating was private and well spaced. Great job!
4
Looking for a good coffee then head to The Providore. Was the best coffee we had in Singapore. Plus they sell snacks and chocolate to take back to your room.
4
A great place for a snack or a hearty meal, breakfast and brunch in particular seem to be the best choices. Service was fast, teas are brewed to perfection and the meal was tasty and plentiful. Strongly recommended.
4
Yes, the title sums it up actually LOL.
I would definitely come back here for more cups of good coffee. Oh, one thing though -- it's a lil more expensive.
3
I love the ambient of this place, look nice and cozy, small place but nice. But when I have to talk about the food, hmm... I ordered lobster mac and cheese, and It tasted nothing, the pasta was a little bit undercooked , and I'm sorry, but the food doesn't impress me at all for sure, or maybe I should order something else ?
4
Had the Bomba Paella and together with a glass of ice latte. The paella was served piping hot, and the moment I took the first bite, you would know it is well-prepared with fresh ingredients fresh herb. It is really wonderfully made. Will visit again soon
5
Most definitely the best coffee on orchard road (see photo) and a delicious club sandwich. Also love their pineapple, blackberry and mint juice, what's unique about it is that it comes with a pineapple crisp. Nice touch and it's divine!Their banana pancakes are super generous in size, rather fluffy and tasty.Definitely worth a try if you've never been.

I was attracted to its hip, modern decor that's why I decided to dine here; I really didn't know what to expect. They have a mini market in one corner that sells breads, cheeses, coffee, etc. When I checked out the menu, I saw that their dishes were called as they were: it was very Top Chef-y. I know that whenever a restaurant's menu is written in a way that is very simple and straightforward, I am in for either a palatable surprise or a disappointing shock. Thankfully, it was the former. The dish I ordered, pork involtini with pancetta, pecorino and sage stuffing with pear and raisin chutney tasted as good as it sounds. I was a bit worried that the chutney might be too sweet, but it was very well-balanced, and added that punctuating bite to the pork loin.I would also like to make special mention of their drinks. They have a very good selection of fresh juices and mocktails and draft beers. (I stopped drinking alcohol so I didn't bother checking the wine list.)I also didn't order dessert because I was in Orchard Road, and nothing beats the one-dollar ice cream that you can buy anywhere along this street
4
The staff are attentive & the coffee good however we visited three times & each time waited up to 40 minutes for our meals which always were served separately up to 10 minutes apart. The poached eggs on toast came with 2 poached eggs, two slices of toast & a small butter. No garnish. It did not look appealing. However our other meals were nicely presented
4
Walking up and down Orchard Road, people watching and shopping can be hard work. So if you want somewhere to rest your feet and have a light lunch, this is the place to go. I recommend the Croque Madamme washed down with a vanilla milkshake. Good value and service
5
My daughter and I had an amazing breakfast here. She had a full breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage with grilled mushrooms and outstanding sour dough bread. She rates the breakfast an 8 and the bread a 9. I had the Croque Madame and I give that a 10. It was the tastiest grilled cheese and ham on the incredible sourdough dough at the Providore that I've had in a very long time that I actually got excited over. The portions were very generously sized. We also give a full10 for the delicious coffee served here. I would definitely recommend this cafe for a breakfast in the city before hitting the stores on Orchard Rd for a bit of shopping
4
Went to the Grandstand branch of the Providore, where it has both an indoor bakery within Pasar Bella as well as an outdoor cafe area. We ordered a bottle of Sangria at $37, which was good value, and enjoyed the non-pretentious and easy ambience contributed in no small part by the friendly staff. Lots of windows and sunshine within an air conditioned seating area. Overall a great place to while away the lazy afternoon
2
Service: None. Chased my order 3 times and fetch my own water. Attitude; Horrible. One of the waitress even explained it is not her fault to keep us waitingWaiting time: Long. We almost cancelled our entire order after 35 mins of waiting Price: Reasonable for Mandain Gallery
3
When I asked for some butter for my bread the waitress dumped it on my table with no knife! When I finally got her attention she brought o e over. The staff seem more interested in chatting with their friends than attending to customers. Good ok nothing special
3
I have been a few times for both brunch and dinner. The dishes are fancy and very tasteful, The service is ok, the location is great. The only thing is that for the price you pay, you really do not get much food. We walked past with a few friends yesterday as we were going to brunch, and someone said, "Why not Providore?", but everyone in the group's answer was the same: too high prices for not enough food. In the same building you have other brunch places where prices are also high but you get really big portions. It's a pity, if they increased their portion sizes we'd be there more often. It's a great place for a drink on the terrace though
3
I've been to Providore a number of times the food has always been good and the coffee is excellent. However my experience is that service, whilst friendly is hit and miss. My last two visits I walked out because my food never came and the waitress was unable to tell me how much longer it would take. This was on a week day..imagine weekends! Needless to say I haven't been back. However my wife went with a friend last month and waited an hour for their food. Tables that came in after were served first. There is obviously a problem with the kitchen
5
We ran into The Providore one evening while strolling along Orchard Road and saw it on the terrace one story above the street. Deciding to give it a try we went and sat down and thank goodness we did!The food is relatively inexpensive, delicious, and presented in a manner that belies it's cafe type appearance. I had the prosciutto wrapped asparagus with a poached egg and parmesan cheese on top and it was truly excellent.One of the coolest parts about the place is that you can sit outside on the terrace and look over the edge at people one story below passing by on Orchard Road while you listen to the birds (birds are active around sunset time and they are loud, just a warning haha).Things were good enough I went back the next day to try the Charcuterie Board and was stunned by the quality, presentation, and sheer size of the board.Be sure to try the affogato for dessert if you go, it's top notch!Service was helpful and friendly, if not that fast. That's sort of a theme around the world though; a lot of us in the US are used to servers being there instantly and checking in constantly (just because they aren't doesn't mean they aren't hospitable, customs are just different haha)
5
We dined with our daughter early one Sunday morning. Everything about our experience was top notch, from the single estate coffee, the smoothie full of fresh fruit and the home made cordials for the soda water. The food was also awesome, imaginative dishes well executed with great tastes. Staff were pleasant and helpful. It will take some beating as the best breakfast in Singapore
4
Not sure if we liked this place just because it was like being back in Aus or was it.........The great Italian plate of beautiful mozzarella, Parma ham and rocket (which came with "no other rubbish on it" as my daughter observedThe nice glass of crisp Chardonnay The good strong tea in a potOr the two thick milkshakes
4
Providore is a great place for breakfast. When I am in Singapore, I always take breakfast there. The coffee is Aussie style, and they serve Sourdough and Avocado. Just my style to get the day kicked off. The decor is contemporary Aussie, the service is attentive, and the music edgy! Get down and enjoy a little piece of Melbourne in Singapore
1
I was excited to try their ricotta pancakes but after waiting for almost an hour, it was served raw... The uncooked pancake batter was still oozing from the inside
Bad food and bad service spoiled our day.
I will not go back!
4
We stopped only to have a quick brunch during shopping. We had a poached egg and an ice cream and both were well presented and deliciuos. Service was good and the view on Orchard Road is a definitive plus. Raccomended!
3
Its a great place to eat - warm ambience, fresh food and a fine service. HOWEVER, if you are a vegetarian, there's only one dish to order which is a let down (no, the dish was awesome tasting, but what would I return to try next time?). If you can excuse that, then do visit. I did not try the famous coffee (went for dinner), but the fresh fruit and camomile tea were very good. The online menu on their website seems more elaborate than what was shown to us at the restaurant - wonder whether there are diff menus? Anyway, its a stylistic cafe that shuts down by about 11:00 PM or so
4
We come here to have our breakfast during our last day of visit in Singapore, food was ok, service was ok as well, couple of the servers are from the previous restaurant we visit few days ago which they work in Wild Honey or Jones Grocers, they have a simple range of breakfast nothing complicated. Price is well the cheapest amongst the three restaurant for breakfast. The portion is small comparing to the previous two restaurant. And a funny set up of two lots which is one is a take away corner and a dinning area
3
I didn't get the hype of the place. I tried to dine in once and they failed to impress me. The food was average (even bad with the pricetag) and I didn't even want to try the pastry because it didn't lift my appetite. Service was bad. I mean, yeah Singapore service is bad but providore is even worse. I asked the waiter about a filtered coffee, whether the coffee will be served in Lungo/Espresso amount of water and he rudely said, "It's not espresso or long black , ma'am. It's another kind of coffee" with a boring tone as if I don't understand coffee. Well... I asked him one more time about the amount of water for the coffee and he repeated his answer. I didn't even want to argue. A waiter supposed to provide information, not talking down to the customer when a customer ask a question.Bad impression on that one. And it was unofrgivable because the food was not good
4
Food and coffee was excellent, if a little expensive. It's nice to sit out on the balcony and watch people go by as you eat.Service however was dreadful, staff were quite inattentive and it took a good 15 minutes to get someone to get our bill, and an additional 10 minutes to pay
3
I have visited The Providore on numerous occasions for business and personal engagements over the last year.The food is excellent and well presented. Their deli selection is really quite delectable and their savoury menu is also quite good.Their outdoor seating unfortunately faces Orchard Road directly and therefore can get quite dusty and noisy. Unfortunately, their service quality ranges from good to absolutely horrendous depending on the staff rotation. I have experienced both ends of the spectrum on the numerous visits I have made. At best the service is prompt and friendly. At worse the service is non existent or rude.Rather unfortunate for such a delightful cafe
1
went there last Saturday, as Wild and Honey 1 Floor above had 1 hour waiting time we should have waited. The setting is nice but thats as far as it goes, there been approx 12-14 waiter/waitresses but apart of 1 or 2 the rest was running around like Headless chickens we and the 2 tables next to us waited 40 mins for our Food.. 1 portion scrambled eggs and 1 Poached egg when the food final arrived , the poached egg was not even fully cooked, and scrambled eggs been cold. The bill was close to 100 sgd really not worth it.Never agai
4
Located away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road (main area) this is a convenient location for brunch. The coffee is great (of course) and the spanish eggs are a must. The service was okay as we had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled. You can buy produce from the deli to take home and the cakes looked delicious. Next visit will be for afternoon tea
4
Providore is a lovely caf√© on the second level of the Mandarin Gallery overlooking Orchard Road and has a large terrace area if you want to sit outdoors. Beautifully cool inside though. It serves a range of Western caf√© style meals and variety of focaccias as well as a good selection of desserts. I went in for afternoon tea around 4pm. Had a hot chocolate which was very good and a chocolate blueberry cake which was delicious and moist. It had a thick buttercream frosting which on its own didn't taste like much but went perfectly with the cake and was better after 5 minutes at room temperature than straight out of the fridge. The service was very friendly and efficient although perhaps a touch slow. They also sell a rang of teas and coffees and have a deli
4
the Pancakes are a very. The only thing to improve is that they only have one soze of Americano Coffee
4
This is another nice quiet place in busy orchard road Singapore .....great coffee, delicious light meals and nibbles. A good place to take a break from shopping and go through your shopping purchases LOL
4
Went there for lunch and had the steak sandwich - very nice. Fairly good service, pleasant atmosphere. Food was tasty.
2
Despite the excellent location, nice decoration and great outdoor terrace allowing a fantastic people watching spot along Orchard Road. There is very little else to praise The Providore on.After an extended wait in the queue to be seated at a table despite many tables being vacant for the duration of our wait, we were seated and ignored for a good 15 minutes before a staff member told us of the limited menu available at that time. (5 pm on a Saturday ) Drinks were served to our table over a further 15 minute period instead of all together and then this was repeated with our food orders. By the time the last guest was served, the first had already finished and was thinking desert which we decided we could not afford the time. We found that we had difficulty getting the attention of the staff who did not seem to be terribly busy at any point in our visit. Suggest this place for the patient and only for an unhurried coffee
4
Chanced upon this place due to a bad blister due to new sneakers and had a really nice time there. I was at the Mandarin gallery branch and was recommended to try their soda drink which is a mixture of great blend. Truly tasty and the tiramisu was nice too. Nice place to chill out after a day of shopping. Defintely returning

Explored Mandarin Gallery for a bite to eat after ending the working week. Settled on The Providore as the menu sounded very enticing, even if the descriptions were guilty of a common fault in Singapore: the attempt to be very 'gourmet-y'. Staff was helpful in accommodating a vegetarian choice for the girl, not very apt at explaining menu in terms of popular choices. "If you like pepper, you'll like the pepper tuna steak", when asking about how popular the tuna steak was. Right.We sat outside, the view of Orchard road was pleasant and you're able to do some people watching. What we offered: asparagus with poached egg, shaved parmesan, black truffle vinaigrette; pepper tuna steak with capers, endive, onion and fennel; chai latte; premium soda.How was it? $18 for 4 asparagi, 1 poached egg and 2 rolls of roasted prosciutto (served on the side as requested).. you have got to be joking. The pricetag would be silly enough if the dish was fantastically executed, but it wasn't. Simple execution, which would have been fine priced at $10 or $11. The prosciutto was not tasty and flavorful but rather greasy and I'm not sure why it was additionally salted.Tuna steak was good quality and well grilled. The pepper was overbearing and dwarfed the more subtle flavors of endive, fennel. The capers didn't work with the dish but the onion did. It was enjoyable. Drinks served were of high quality, especially the home-ground chai spice mixture was very welcome.Not really that interested in coming again

It was my first visit to The Providore at Mandarin gallery today ¬†and was very excited to try out as I've heard lots of good comments about this cafe. My sister and I were late while my other three friends were already seated there to have their brunch. They asked for a table for 5 but unfortunately they were given a table of four. So naturally, my three friends didn't want to wait any longer, so they said OK. So when my sister and I arrived, we asked for an extra chair but I was shocked with the response that given by the Manager, Melvin . Not only he did not try his best to get us ONE chair, ¬†he said: your friends were OK with a table of four in the first place" ¬†For your information, ¬†he was very very unwelcoming at all! No smile, no eye contact, no service language, like as if ¬†it's my problem that I didn't get a chair. Later on, a very nice staff of yours manage to get us a chair. We were very angry but we sat down regardless how angry we were. Later on, a staff believed to be called Shah served us our food. The moment he arrived at our table, he literally shouted at me and said: Can you please sit ¬†over that side because you are blocking the way!" I was in total shock and look at him and said," you don't expect me to sit over the other side, middle of the pathway blocking the ¬†entrance of the mall." And fyi, the table next to us was not vacant at that point of time, i wasnt blocking anyone at all, plus he could have used another way to come to our table. He was superbly rude and he dump the drinks and our food so hard on the table. ¬†It is totally unacceptable!!!!! ¬†I myself is a service provider, I know sometimes it's not easy to deal with difficult customers. But my sister and I weren't being unreasonable, ¬†we jz want to dine in a very comfortable cafe feeling welcomed by your staff. ¬†It's 1st of January and our day was totally ruined by this experience! ¬†It was so unpleasant and memorable in a very bad way!¬†The manager clearly know that we were unhappy but no service recovery action has been done. It is an irresponsible act and no sense of ownership attitude

Finally, a great casual cafe for good wholesome breakfasts and a decent Flat White coffee.I loathe going to cookie cutter Starbucks et al outlets for coffee. The a Providore scored well on a few key points:Great coffee (Aussies take note!)Great Breakfast - eggs, bacon, pancakes. All Yummo.Good service - not intrusive or pushyIndoor/Outdoor seatingPat and Sticks Ice Cream Cakes!! Ggrrraaawwwgglll! Yummo.It's next door to Bathing Ape - the hippest name in Japanese streetwear

We popped in for a quick coffee on Sunday morning as we refused to drink coffee at our hotel. I would have loved to have had breakfast there but it was included in our hotel rate so we just ate our hotel. The place was full of Westerners but we were seated promptly. We opted for the bar as just having coffee and didn't want to take the last table. I had a skinny piccolo latte which was great tasting, they use Toby's Estate Coffee. Service was not an issue. Great coffee, satisfied, mission accomplished, would come back for breakfast
2
I had walked past this outlet on many occasions.Two things were apparent, the modern concept and a young, nervous serving staff standing very attentively like a hawk facing the diners, he was fidgeting.Several weeks ago, I decided to dine-in here for my first time.I was greeted promptly and I revealed that it was my first visit.For a weekend evening, it was remarkably quiet as only 2 other tables were occupied.THE SERVICETo my surprise, the manager sent over the most junior waiting staff, the one I have seen fidgeting on many occasions. As he laid the menu on the table, he simultaneously asked for my drinks order.I stifled my laughter and asked him to allow me a moment to decide.As I looked at the menu he gave me, there were only a limited number of items !!As I looked up for service, there appeared to be no staff within sight.A few minutes later, i beckoned a passing staff from afar.He came over with a great smile. This staff should win a gold medal. When I asked for a drinks menu and told him this was my first visit, he quickily returned with the said menu plus a "Special" menu which listed more dishes.THE FOODI ordered The Tasting Platter of Starters.This consisted of 5 different starters.Two of these were excellent :The baby tomato and delicate goats cheese on a crispy bread was "explosively delicious"The fig wrapped in ham (a substituted starter) was succulently sweet and refreshing.For my main course, I ordered the tuna pasta.The seared tuna was LIMP, and the pasta was overcooked.A wasted dish.As I was still hungry, I decided to order a full starter of just Tomato and goats cheese which I had so enjoyed earlier on.EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT !!The order came with 4 pieces. All 4 tomatoes were smaller than the one I had earlier. Each sat on a small amount of goats cheese which sat on a over-baked HARD CRUSTED slice of baguette (not the warm crispy bread earlier). Worse of all, all 4 pieces were DRENCHED in olive oil. You pick a piece up and oil would drip !!All I could taste was the hard baguette and dripping olive oil !!As a personal rule, I rarely send food back (unless I am a regular at the outlet). There is a high chance your food will appear with "added secretions" on it. If there is a real need to, I would reject the food and leave the outlet. A final note about the glass of red wine I ordered.There were 2 choices, I cannot recall which one I had (as it was many weeks ago).It was acidic, far from mellow, and at $15 per glass, a real bad choice.Overall Bill amount for one person was just over $80It will be a long while before I spend another 80 dollars here ..
