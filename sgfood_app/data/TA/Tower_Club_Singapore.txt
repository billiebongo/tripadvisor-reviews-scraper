Used my AMEX dining voucher on a random night at Tower Club Straits Bar. Relatively quiet night at 8pm on a weekday. Although it prides itself to be an exclusive club, really nothing to shout about in terms of the view (for some reason, the decor makes it difficult to get a good.view of the skyline) as the bar seems to be too bright and the low chairs by the window certainly don't help.Food was subpar, especially the appetizer that came in lukewarm temperature and mains were simply forgettable. Biggest problem is the pack of attentive service. Area may be too big for a few waiters to serve and our section is often ignored. Will have to walk all the way to reception corner to get the waiter to help out or take order. Not what I will consider as great customer service. Suggest Zaffarano or One Altitude if you are looking for similar places with much better services and food

Visited the Chinese restaurant, the view was spectacular and I love the interior. The restaurant is pretty quiet and private, kids are not allowed except on Saturdays. The food was great, their Peking duck is easily one of the best I have tried so far in Singapore. Crispy skin wrapped in thin pancakes, portion was fine. I did notice that there weren't many experienced service staff, the one serving us looked pretty green, but that's not much of a huge problem for me, he still managed to get things done, probably just a little slow. Overall experience is good.

We had our small group Christmas party in this club last December. One of the best Christmas dinner events I’ve had in a long time. Despite our difficulty in accessing the boardroom from the parking area, our overall experience itself was well appreciated by everyone in the group. Everything went well from the dining venue to the food quality and service level. First surprise was the view from the dining place. Venue is awesome with its grand view of the marina bay and surrounding areas. Feels like you’re on top of everything.The dining hall set the mood with its intimate ambience. The party had a really private nature with its closed door arrangement. We all enjoyed the dinner table top setup. I have good review for everything in our dinner menu. It consisted of many courses, starting with slices of raw hokkaido scallops with kaluga caviar and horseradish cream, and followed by pan-fried chicken supreme with pancetta. The bread-crusted foie gras was a delight with its caramelized apple, while the pan-seared red snapper fillet was outstanding as the main course. Dessert was memorable too, with warm chocolate mousse.Fantastic first dining and party experience at the Tower Club. I don’t mind going back here over and over.Except that I am not a member. You need to find one to get in

Ba Xian can never go wrong with the food.. Ba xian is excellent for their Peking Duck.. a definite must try... and the Little Red Book of Dessert is stunning collection... never had a bad dish...

I had high hopes for this place given all I'd heard about it - the exclusivity, the view, the food - but all came crashing down once the food was served. First off, the lobby that greets you on the 62nd floor of the Republic Plaza is pretty spectacular and opulent but that's about as much as you'll be awed. The view from the Chinese restaurant Ba Xian on the 63rd floor was nothing to crow about, with the best vantage points already blocked by Ocean Financial Centre. It took rather long for the food to be served at Ba Xian and bizarrely a number of the dishes were already lukewarm by the time they were served. The Kurobuta Pork Fillet cooked in a coffee sauce that was much raved about turned out rather pedestrian; definitely had way better versions elsewhere. The wok fried crocodile meat was the only dish that really came out piping hot but was truly unspectacular in taste. The BBQ Pork Bun that frankly you shouldn't go wrong with in a restaurant that serves dim sum was so underwhelming in its lack of filling and skin that was way too thick. The Red Bean Pancake that we had for dessert should ordinarily have been a crowd pleaser was too sweet. Frankly none of the dishes impressed and service was spotty at best. The only thing that was above par was the price, a price not worth paying for frankly. Just as well that this is an exclusive members-only club as it is not worth a repeat visit

Great cantonese style restaurant with competent dim sum. This members only club sits at the top of one of Singapore's tallest buildings. It has a number of different style restaurants. We ate at the Cantonese one. The furnishings and color palette can be best described as faux Edwardian. But you hardly notice because of the floor to ceiling windows. At the edge of the Marina Bay, the views are stunning. You can see everything from Sentosa Island to almost the airport, and of course, the entire Marina Bay.The food could be from any of Hong Kong's terrific restaurants. The dim sum was authentic and the noodles and vegetables fresh and crisp. The service was attentive. We were offered a stool where we could put our purses and bags -- and a club cloth was draped over the bags. When our tea got cold, a new pot appeared magically before our old pot was even removed.Made me wish I could be a member

Really amazing view of Singapore, the drink selection is really nice. I didn't try the restaurant yet but it looks really nice

I visited this club as I am a member of one of their reciprocal ClubsIt's close to Raffles Place Station I had rung the Club to enquire whether the Club had any Polo Shirts for sale in my sizeThe Receptionist couldn't have been more helpful When I arrived at the Club she greeted me by name although we had never metShe didn't miss a thing I went to the 64th floorof the Club to met Gerard who found me exactly what I wantedI enjoyed a cup of tea on the 62nd floor whist taking in the ViewI will return
5
Its on the 62nd floor and the entire Marina and city can be seen. Have been here for many client events. Great canapes and wine! Even after so many visits, the place still wows each time
5
One of the best venue i ever visit in Singapore. Here is membership venue consist bar, western and chinese dining.View is partially blocked but still good. food is far better than view. You can expect highest service as well
5
Wonderful views on top of a tall tower in the center of Singapore. Excellent food and service. Recommend the experience.
5
Tried all the three restaurants here and all were great. Fine dining at Atlantic, lovely set lunches in a classy setting. Great Chinese food at Ba Xian and international buffet at Straits Bar.
5
Very nice restaurant. Amazing food, good service. Just to warn you that you can get in with membership only.

Towner club is only allow for members and their guest. Reservation and attire is strictly applicable. The food ordered is round the table. Each person have a servicing of per order. The Kurobuta pork was very tender and the taste of the sauce made from herb. The dim sum was nice and its serve hot from the oven but the waiting time is way too long. Even their dessert have to be serve in 7-8mins. They have a nice view of MBS, City Hall and facing the sea. They provide mouth wash for their guest which I have not seem any restaurant do that
5
For a superb singapore Chinese meal comparable - and even better than minjiang - order the following. 1. Baked kurobuta pork ribs with sliced cabbage - and COFFEE yes COFFEE sauce. Just amazing. 2. Wasabi prawns - nice but conventional 3. Dry chicken with chilies - a super kungpao4. Honey glazed honshimeiji mushrooms - ooooh - these are goooood. 5. E-fu noodles with duck - ha ha ha ha. These are awesome. 6. Peking duck. Loved it. Our hosts are members. Service was great. We have some lovely whiskey with the food.
3
While this is a members club you are able to visit if you are a guest or have reciprocal club membership or certain credit cards also allow you to visit. There is both a western dining room plus a Chinese restaurant which I prefer. The dim sum lunch and Peking duck are good. The western food is ok but nothing special. Nice views as you are on the 62nd floor.

We visited Ba Xian and had a couple of dishes that turned out to be good in terms of portion and quality. Staff were well trained and place was pretty exquisite. Overall an interesting dining experience but would recommend the 1/2 price dim sum on Weekends instead although personally we haven't tried that
4
The Tower is a members club. But I guess because the members have other places to go to, the dining areas are also open to some others....higher tiered Amex n UOB visa infinite card member, for instance. Those types. Anyway if u have access, the club has very nice views, and you can have Saturday lunch dim sum at Ba Xian, the Chinese restaurant, at little more than $20 per pax. Tea is complimentary. No wonder the rich get richer. They actually pay less for things. So strange, no

~I booked 2015Oct3 for this amazing low priced buffet of $78++ per person at the Atlantic room with Andy their restaurant manager and the food wasn't the main course, it was the wines you'd be so embarrassed to waste (see photos)~every year The Tower Club host their version of a wine awards with an exclusive sponsor, wines that are awarded get to be served and sold throughout their F&B outlets~after the judging, a whole range of sparkling, red, white & rose wine bottles are left unfinished and will have to be discarded the next day. It's for this reason that this offer is made just once a year~Andy was on had to meet us and bring us to our table, in fact he showed us the preferred wines from the day's judging and my wife tasted all of them - Great!~not many people knew about this annual offer, but strangely of the half filled restaurant all the patrons of every table were majority ladies (groups of them)... apparently wine buffets area favorite among women at the Tower Club~the highlight of the food wasn't even on the menu as we'd a great lobster risotto at the Atlantic room before but they were out of lobster and the chef offered an ala carte seafood risotto instead. this was brought table side mixed and stirred with a dollop of butter before serving - YUMzDefinitely will be back this October for the fine wines :

Tower club as 2 restaurants and a bar. Ba Xian the Chinese restaurant has great food Straits Bar has a great ambience and view !!They have a pianist in the Straits bar , and he plays very well ...... UNFORTUNATELY , the Piano in the smallish bar is too loud. It does not allow you to have conversation . I would like to have the piano there , surely , but i would love it if they can reduce the volume of the sound . Don't order a Margherita @ the Straits bar Its a private club so i believe that not everyone can visit the restaurants , but if you get a chance, then please do visit The Straits Bar also has a reasonably good food menu .
4
Old school an awesome experience and an excellent venue with great views of Singapore. If you are lucky enough have a drink and enjoy the view.
4
Nice view. Limited Brunch Selection. Kids eat free. Very Tasty Roast Pork. Dress Code applies at Straits Bar cafe.
5
We arrived after meetings and the order was phoned through by our host, the duck was to die for, the wines impeccable, service great and the rest of the meal brilliant. What a view, can't believe it
3
The view on the 62 floor of the Republic Plaza Tower is outstanding. The food is ok and the hospitality is good. But something is missing. The dynamics, vitality and energy of Singapore are not around here.
3
Had a few client events here recently, in various venues. Location is very central (even more than it used to be when it was waterfront), but really need some update. Staff all very friendly still though...
2
Atlantic restaurant very expensive for poor quality food,we went as they had an Alaskan crab promotion, portion size was terribly over priced and only had one portion left, we where the only table there at the time.meat selections weren't cooked as requested all came out medium well , service was slow. Charging over 100 usd a head for lunch with poor food but with a great view really inst a great formula for repeat business, and as its a business lunch i find it very embarrassing that we chose this venue. I would recommend the straits Bar for drinks abut again the food is lacking

I write as a frequent guest at the Tower Club for breakfast and lunch. The views over Singapore are excellent and there is an initial superficial air of sophistication, but the experience is too eroded on closer consideration to warrant a higher rating relative to expectations.In general, the waitstaff need significantly more training to reach even the basic levels of savoir faire that the Club appears to present in its marketing. They are frequently not to be found during servings, or are inattentive and nonchalant - to the extent that I wonder how many of them were recruited directly from McDonalds. I appreciate the difficulty of attracting and retaining quality service staff in Singapore, but proper recruiting, training and management could smooth-over most of the issues.The Club is elegantly furnished and there are private dining rooms, but there are no semi-private places to sit and read a newspaper, or have a conversation. Tables in the open lobby appear to be the only places available. Odd, for a club.The Club's policy on visitors and use by associate club members is totally inconsistent. Sometimes, they just require a card to be shown, other times they want an introductory letter, and sometimes they appear to limit visits to certain timeframes only. Very frustrating to attempt to discern the whim of the person taking the booking.Other than the aforementioned points, the Club generally offers a good experience, especially as a venue to host visitors. With stronger management and a higher quality of training for staff, it would be a lot better
5
I've been here a couple of times as a guest. The view is amazing and it has a great atmosphere for lunch or upstairs for quiet drinks. It wasn't crowded or noisy so you could have conversations without worrying about who else is listening in.I am in the process of joining up myself.

~Roger Yeoh their Ba Xian Manager of the Chinese Restaurant asked us to go for Saturday Half Priced Dim Sum and we brought our 2 younger kids for the first time~hourly parking at Republic Plaza for a non season pass holder is tougher with their really tight corners when coming back down :( & if you parked at the smaller mezzanine lots, it's kinda scary to walk up or down those slopes as their experienced drivers can literally speed turn that corner and won't see us at all (unless you take the fireman's lift :(~a short walk from carpark thru some shops and up the escalator to level 2, let security at the gates know you're going up to Level 62 and you'll either be given some cards to drop in the gate or be waved thru~on Saturday's the Tower Club may allow kids with collared tees but no sandals, adults are still expected to dress business casual, reservations are mandatory~our order didn't take long and we polished off each set as they arrived just in time~first the deep fried shrimp roll and deep fried spring roll with chicken were both served with mayo, easy to eat and pre-sliced in 2, tasty~second steamed cheong fun came in one long strip with char siew at one end and prawns on the other, tasty~the pork & century egg congee was easy to eat~all the steamed dime sum arrive together last, xiao long bao, nice and soupy hot. har kow s sheen a yellow on the outside yummy, char siew bao normal and the panfried pork bun very fragrant~everything served as expected, nothing fantastic... service is GOOD at Ba Xian (it is the Tower Club) it's the atmosphere & view that takes your breathe away somewhat :
5
Went here with our family for a treat,which it was.it is a very elegant restaurant the service is good but doses not live up to the deccor it's just not the 5 star you would like to have.the food (dim sum)was very good and made on premises
5
This is a great Club. Really tasty food in the Western restaurant and the view from the top floor bar is outstanding, definitely worth checking out.
5
What a beautiful venue! I was thrilled with the views from the Atlantic Dining Room, the food and the service. Try a Straits 64, it was a phenomenally good cocktail!
As a non-Club member be aware that it is +++
5
We welcomed 2014 at the western restaurant. We truly enjoyed that night dancing along the band. We were so impressed with the food and we came back again for a dinner.
I also like the outstanding view and the staff are amazingly efficient.
5
A great view; wonderfully proficient and friendly staff and exceptional food. I would happily admit to being a regular for Saturday dim sum - it never fails to disappoint. Stand outs:1) The staff and the view.2) The food is outstanding. (Make sure your order the Peking duck and red bean pancake - actually just order the whole dim sum menu since it is delicious and value for money!).3) Saturdays allow children and also you can wear denim. Men take note to wear a shirt with a collar

Great views, great food great service. The experience was well worth the visit, was really tempted to go with the duck but resisted as it looked a bit over cooked on the next table, so april1xsu you were right. Had the grilled pork, just my cup of tea... As always you just have to accept Singapore is expensive!!! Get on with it..
4
Went yesterday with a friend. Tried French duck Supreme. The food plating was excellent but the duck was too chewy and i got tired of chewing it to pieces. My friend, who tried grilled pork chop commented it was tender but the pork taste was a wee overwhelming. Altanic rotates menus frequently. I would say this menu is not impressive. But as usual, the view & serene ambience soothes our spirits. Will visit again for sure!

The tower club offers spectacular view of Singapore. Its interior decor exudes grandeur. Its food is of high quality which speaks well of its chef(s). May be this has been such a hyped club that we have raised our expectation too high that apart from the above three points, we really cannot find something to compliment its staff other than the helpful and friendly Chinese restaurant manager (he was in suit so we think he is the restaurant manager). From the moment we arrived at the lower level of the club, there was no smile written on the faces of the two staff (one male and one female) standing there. However, the gentleman did show us to the lift. Next, on the upper level, the same coldness continued to linger on amongst the waitresses till a proactive, friendly and helpful gentleman in suit whom we believe was the restaurant manager offered to show us the way to the washroom. Well, overall it was not-too-bad an experience. Unless we want to rub shoulders with who's who in the club or to attend business lunches or dinners, we think we won't visit The Tower Club again. (We are not official members of the Tower Club but owing to some special privileges we have, we can patronize its F&B facilities.
4
The tower club traditionally has the who's who of corporate Singapore wining and dining with their guests. The club was put together by the who's who as a place to call their own. They then opened it up to the public so that others can share the cost of the place :-)Overall a great place for business meals with great views of the city. Their Chinese restaurant as well as the western meals are of high quality. Set menus for lunch make it easy to order and to focus on the meeting at hand.Hope you found the review helpful

Very posh members club on the 62nd floor of Republic Plaza. Love the exclusivity, service and decor.We decided to have breakfast at The Tower Club. First time here and surprisingly, the price of breakfast here is much more affordable here as compared to hotel prices. Simple buffet selection at $12 gets you a healthy selection comprising, but not limited to, fresh fruits, yoghurt, Danish pastries, ham, cheese, cereal, bread and croissant besides fruit juices.We also enjoyed starting the beautiful day with a wonderful aerial view of Singapore
4
This is a wonderful restaurant at the top of one of the towers in the central business district. As you would expect from a place like this, the service is exceptional, the wine is wonderful and the food is great. In addition, the views are to die for.
4
Wonderful location for private dining. Professionally managed. Pleasant food on the 'good' rather than 'outstanding' scale of things. Attentive staff. Go for a special occasion. Recommended.
5
The Tower Club's facilities rank among the best in the world. All three of its restaurants are well appointed and offer breathtaking views and excellent service.
5
The view is great from this location... The room we had dinner in was beautiful... Perfect for a small private function. It was a set menu and every course was tasty and well presented. The matching wines were the highlight of the evening!
5
The club continues to impress with its Chinese food. If you ask the will adapt any part of the many to you own requirements. Their wasabi prawns and sweet and sour are the best in town.
5
these are the only for the most exclusive diners who appreciate fine cognac & wines like martell cordon bleu and Hennesy XO.
4
The Tower Club was a great addition to the CBD scene when it opened in the late 90's. It still stands out, even now that there are plenty of good eateries around. The food is consistently and very good, service is excellent, the atmosphere is elegant and calm, and the view is superb. Private rooms are the best in the CBD
4
We had a lovely lunch during the Administrative/Professional Week. The menus is great...crispy shrimp with salted egg and pork char siew, braised shark's fin soup, pan fried venison steak, stewed mee-swa, and chilled rice puree which is few over hundred dollars.From this restaurant, the view is amazingly beautiful. You could see the entire business district and even MBS by far. All in all, we had a good lunch here
4
During lunch it is great to dine on the upper levels where it is more of a causal experience, and the food is served more of a western & eatern buffet manner. The view is stunning, service always consistantly good and the food quality above average. Overall a rating scaor of 8 for this establishment
5
It was my first time going to the Chinese restaurant Ba Xian with my stepsister and her family last Saturday night. She ordered a set menu, all the food tasted delicious, the fish was very tender, the mushroom was very good, the fried mi hun was very good too. The dessert avocado with green tea ice cream looked very mouth-watering (though I did not have it, due to personal reasons). My stepsister said that their Western food is also very good, and we will go to try it next time.  The table we were sitting at was overlooking the Marina Bay sands. The only thing I would complain is that it was rather noisy at around 8 to 8:30 p.m. as they were rehearsing for the upcoming National Day Parade
5
Tower club is located on the 62nd floor and the view is great. We had some difficulties in getting our reservation for the German white asparagus dinner, but the problem was turned to an opportunity. It was a text book example of restaurant and club making a difficult situation to unforgettably good service. So we ended having the dinner in a private dining room on an evening when the dinner was not supposed to be served at all. And what a dinner! White asparagus is our favorite and now we got a fusion of German asparagus with French touch. The asparagus was perfect being a bit crunchy and crispy and the tastes of other ingredients were mixed with excellent taste. The same applied for every dish of the set menu and the biggest surprise was the selection of white wines. The white wine from Alsace complemented the food perfectly. And the service - also on top of everything. The waiter was always there when we needed him. And one more thing: I hate restaurants were people seemed to be more interested in their smart phones than the food and atmosphere. In Tower club you are not allowed to use your phone. That shows some class and if you cannot survive without your phone for 2 hours then it is better you find some other place. For us it was tranquility that we seldom experience
