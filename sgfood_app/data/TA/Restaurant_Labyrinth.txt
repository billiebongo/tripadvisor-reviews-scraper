I like how the menu is deisgned with our local food in mind. Most of the food executed were excellent. Wines were a little dissapointing though.
5
It was a very pleasant dinner experience we had! We were looking forward to the next dish being served and each dish just keeps getting better.
Recommend this place for anniversary, or a romantic dinner.
5
This is our second visit and our 125th starred fine dining restaurant. The innovation of the food, presentation and quantity has improved(you now get an umbrella with the crab!) and it is truly deserving of it's star
5
The food was tasty and presented beautifully! My friend and I loved the five course lunch menu and had a lovely time.

Very interesting menu with a take on a standard range where the chef spins it in a whole new dir direction.
Some may not enjoy this style and we didn‚Äôt like every dish but it was a great experience!

A modern and stylish restaurant inside of Esplanade Mall where you don't expect this type of restaurant. We made a reservation weeks ago and the table was ready on time.The welcome was very friendly and nice.The dinner was a set menu and we ordered the pairing wine menu. Here the difficulties started. The food was great, but the wine was served in small and tacky glasses (like tasting glasses) - without any explanation and not together with the food, but after we finished the pairing course already.After the 3rd course, they understood that we were not happy and they changed the waiter. After that change the service was perfect. The wines were served on time with the food in nice glasses and with nice explanation.The food was fantastic, very nice presented and with very surprising tastes as well.Our waiter made this evening special and he recommended a fantastic digestive with champagne berries - a real fantastic experience.Thank you for a good night. Just because of the difficult start 4 points

Read much about the hype about this place and decided to try it out to satisfy my own curiosity.Dining here has further confirmed my distaste for Michelin stars. I can‚Äôt quite under how this place deserves a Michelin Star.The service was horrid and the food just passable.

Last week, my guest and i walked into the restaurant in anticipation to a unique dining experience. After all, this is a Michelin rated establishment. Among the five-courses that were served for lunch, a few creations stood out while the rest was a good effort in showcasing local Asian favourites in a clever way. We commend the chef and his team for a well executed menu. However, our experience was marred by one of the service staff (tallest among the 3). After settling at the table, the napkin was literally 'dropped', not placed on my lap. When the first course was served, the staff mumbled through the items in the tiffin container, and there was a pause. My guest then asked about the shared dish at the centre and the staff curtly replied: ‚ÄúLet me finish first‚Äù. My guest and I were taken aback.  We thought maybe, he was having a bad day, but when we observed the way he served the other tables near us, he was warm and friendly, especially towards a table of corporate looking diners. That made us wonder - why the double standards? Towards the third course, a presumably more senior staff attended to us. He explained the uniqueness of each element on the plate very well which helped us appreciate the food better.  Throughout the five courses which lasted about 2 hours, my half full glass of water was only filled up once. The lemongrass drink we had was unfortunately tasteless. We left the restaurant feeling dissatisfied
5
The great service started even before the dinner when they called to check if we were going for a theatre program (we were). We enjoyed the roast pork and risotto and the chili crab dish was excellent as usual. Desserts were a little too sweet for our taste (maybe it‚Äôs just us). But the sweetness was balanced by the tea offered by the wait staff who was considerate enough to notice that we still had time before our theatre program.
3
Just found the whole place too dark with no natural light coming in. Service was good and efficient ,but the place seemed souls. The food is very good but quirky and definitely a one off. Not sure I will go back.May be better at night time with a bet more ambience. Sorry to say not a fan !
5
The dishes were a unique blend (and play) of local cuisine with out-of-box ideas. The squid and saffron bak chor mee was delightful, and the tiger prawn risotto was amazing. Would love to be back again
5
I loved the tasting menu but it is definitely one of the more heavier ones despite it only having 10 dishes. Worthy of its Michelin star and the experience was incredible. I recommend it to anyone who is visiting
5
Great concept of newly interpreting traditional dishes of Singapore. Super attentive staff that made sure we had a great night. Definitely our best meal in Singapore!
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Definitely worth the visit. Service was great and each course was well explained.
Restaurant was a little difficult to find in the shopping centre with limited signage but a delightful evening - would recommend.
1
During our stay in Singapore we chose the Labyrinth as we wanted a cool, easygoing but high class food gourmet experience.Unfortunatly this is not what we got.The Aperitiv we ordered came after the third course. I mentioned that I would like to have a short break to drink the cocktail before we go ahead with the dinner. The comment that the waiter hopes that he doesnt has to pay our drinks or food if we wait to long was a desaster.The glasses of the wine pairing really dont have the same size as in Europe, this is an important information if you think about wineparing in European Michelin Star restaurants
5
The food you see is not what you get. The food come with a twist and it is indeed gastronomic adventure for you. I love how the plating is done for each and every dish, and how Labyrinth new Singapore local cuisine into a whole new level. Service staffs were friendly and helpful, the kitchen staffs prepare the food and I love how the food mix together to create a new taste. They definitely deserve the Michelin star
4
Looking for a high end dining experience whilst in Singapore then I would recommend the one Michelin star Labyrinth.I had read in reviews it was difficult to find and that was certainly true. It is located on level 2 of Esplanade mall. There are many restaurants there and unfortunately the mall does not identify the restaurant in its guide so it was just a matter of wandering around and asking people until we found it. A note to the restaurant is that you could put in your website more clear instructions of your location.As the Esplanade mall is on the waterfront I thought there may be views but this is not the case as the restaurant is buried deep in the mall.However it was worth the hunt - the waiters were friendly and attentive. They do a set course degustation menu and I have some seafood allergies and the chef was very understanding in adjusting the menu for me. There were about 8 small courses of a variety of modern Singaporean fare.The venue is intimate but they had arranged the tables so you were not to close to other diners.You can chose to upgrade the menu but we chose the original and were happy. We opted to choose our own wine to accompany the meal
3
I feel it is bringing Singapore local cuisine in a whole new level. To me the local cuisine will always be what it is. It's not like the food was elevated in terms of taste. But just deconstructed and make it in a new way. It is good to give it a try
4
We opted for the pre-theatre dinner, and it is excellent value. The food reminded me of many S.E Asian classics: nasi lemak, rojak, chilli crab, teh tarik, mango with sticky rice. Yet each dish was a creative twist on the original. The highlight for me was the soft-shell crab with chilli crab ice-cream. Presentation was excellent, and the sensory illusion of being on the beach eating eating crabs was amazing.What disappointed us was the service. We weren't made to feel special, unlike our experience in another Michelin starred-restaurant in Singapore. We felt rushed (as our plates were cleared from one course, the next course arrive within 30 seconds). There was minimal explanation of dishes and very little attention given by the waiters. We weren't even offered coffee with our deserts.Finally, our table was a bit too close to another couple's table. And the way it was arranged to pack in more tables meant that my view was of the wall directly behind my wife (while she had a view of the entire restaurant). It took away from the atmosphere of the restaurant. Hopefully, by not choosing the pre-theatre menu you will be treated to a more leisurely experience. And I am quite sure you will enjoy the food. Being familiar with the original dishes that have inspired the menu will probably help you appreciate the chef's creativity even more
4
This place has somewhat mixed reviews, so I decided to check it out. Chilli crab ice cream to match the soft shelled crab was clever. Hard boiled egg dessert was actually panacotta with mango puree as the yolk. I appreciated the creativity of the cuisine and the excellent customer service.
4
Interesting and unique take on local food and drinks. Good for special occasions. But tables are too close together and not enough privacy.
4
The food is quite good but as compared to other fine dining such as Xi-Yan we prefer the latter--more refined in terms of taste and presentation. If we look at pricing, Labyrinth is high, for a like-for-like menu. ($118).
4
Tantalising your tastebuds all the way.
You end up questioning ‚Äú is this real caviar or is it just something created to taste like caviar? It is caviar!!!
It was fun, it was Yummy üòã

Ate once at the old location near chinatown. Moved to the esplanade and even got a michelin star. Local fusion foodThe decor is slightly underwhelming, with tables randomly littered Food is inspired by stuff from heston blumenthal, like his meat fruit, but with a local twist. So we got a wanton, but made to taste like chicken rice. And so onIt's ok, and overall whether it's the food, ambience or service, didn't quite wo

This was our first visit to a Michelin star restaurant in singapore, our expectations were high as we have enjoyed Michelin star dining in many countries. Unfortunately labyrinth didn't quite meet our expectations. There was nothing wrong with the food, drinks or service but there was also no wow factor.The restaurant is inside a shopping centre which feels very strange. Also the open kitchen isn't very impressive as you just look at a microwave and boxes. Enjoyable evening but in our opinion not quite at michelin star standard
5
Restaurant Labyrinth has successfully took interpretation of Singaporean cuisine to the next level. From start to finish, every dish is made with a purpose to bring you back to Singaporean food memories typical of everyone living in this city. The tasting menu consists of a great amount of food and will definitely leave you satisfied
4
I presume the ideas of Labyrinth is to offer Singapore cuisine with presentation in French style. As a true blue Singaporean, I find the taste of food is not really appealing to me. However, it may be good for foreign visitors for food-tasting and for young couple for the ambience of this restaurant.. I also find that 1 set-menu is only available for dinner looks too restrictive, and would like to see 1 or 2 more set-menus are offered in future
5
I had my eye on trying Restaurant Labyrinth for a while, but only decided to go after seeing the owner/chef profiled on the Food Heroes series (which is currently on Krisworld on Singapore Airlines). He was so passionate about showcasing a new twist on Singapore food, we had to try it. We visited on a Saturday night. All the guests appeared to be local. We tried the tasting menu. On an overall basis, the food was superb with very inventive twists to Singapore favorites. I loved the texture and the taste of Bak Chor Mee which was actually squid noodles with scallop, and also liked the Har Cheong porridge and the kaya butter toast. The beef satay however was a bit of a let down after all the other dishes as it didn't seem to have a lot of taste. Portion sizes were fine and I was very full at the end of the meal. The beverage menu was short. Service was pretty average however given the type of restaurant and prices, as was the ambiance. Overall, the restaurant was worthwhile trying for a special occasion for a unique twist on Singapore food.
3
Celebrated my wife's birthday at Labyrinth in Nov 2017. Food wise, it was an eye opener as the chef had interesting interpretations on many of Singapore's local delight. What the restaurant needs to work on will be the service. For one, when the menu was given, the staff did not give us time to digest what's written and came over to try to explain on the various upgrades for the menu. Also, with each dish presented, the staff spoke relatively fast in explaining the dish. I wondered if non locals will be able to fully understand the beauty of each dish, given the speed of the explanation. Some hit and misses, but overall ok
4
Had a lovely lunch there with a friend and we both had an enjoyable time. We even checked out the dinner menu and would definitely be back for more. The five course degustation lunch set menu was filled with great flavours and surprising talking points fused with local food icons that were reinterpreted and reimagined. The restaurant is a different animal from the usual fine dining establishments which could be seen as either charming or jarring - you could hear the Chef√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s instructions in the kitchen and service was less than friendly and attentive - our water was not refilled. But the food is a winner
5
Staff are great, they take every effort to cater to your needs and food allergy. They also spend time to explain each dish for you. Music and ambience was great too. Eating pace was comfortable.
5
Each dish had a story of its own. Presentation was on-point and taste was amazing. Great service too
4
Went to labyrinth with my daughter for dinner. Joseph really took care of us and explained all the dishes clearly. I am not very familiar with Singaporean cuisine and this was a great way to experience the different local dishes in a gastronomic fashion. My daughter had the wine pairing and she enjoyed it. I highly recommend this restaurant!
5
If you are looking for a dining experience to really remember then the one Michelin Star, Labyrinth Restaurant is for you. We enjoyed the ten (10) course, very inventive, degustation menu with matching wines. This was not a 'cheap meal out' alternative but what an experience. The sensational flavours Chef Han has 'developed / created' and presents beautifully onto your plate are to die for and create much discussion if you are lucky enough to be sharing this experience (and I mean a 'real experience') with someone. Each course is described by the excellent staff, who are attentive, but not overly so, which is good for a dining experience.We were lucky enough to get to talk to Chef / Owner Han (apparently an Investment Banker ?? in a previous life), who is a very dedicated and focused Chef and ever so willing to talk about his passion for food, presentation, attention to detail and how and why he set out to create the 'truly innovative' fair he offers at Labyrinth. If you're in Singapore, love food and wine and like to challenge your taste buds with something very different, then Labyrinth will certainly meet your every expectation
5
I love the food here for its creativity and presentation. Unfortunately both times that I came, I was barely satiated and had to look for ‚Äúproper‚Äù food after the meal to fill me up. Always an interesting experience dining here, just wished the portions were bigger.
2
Creative in presentation and the idea of re-creating flavours of well-loved Singapore dishes. Execution was hit-and-miss as some dishes tasted good while others were trying too hard. Personally replacing angus beef with wagyu for the 'satay' seems a real waste of good meat. While presentation is appreciated, I would rather my money be spent on good food itself.Portions are small, cute and great for Instagram but I left without being satisfied in taste, experience or food portion. Ambiance is sorely lacking. Poor lighting and vibe. Can't recommend for fine dining. Service staff standard is generally poor except for one staff who introduced all the dishes. Attention to detail sometimes lacked - such as missing cutlery.Overall, it is of poor value and dining experience. Please try some other Michelin restaurant if you are star-chasing. At SGD200 with a glass of wine for the chef tasting menu, there are many better restaurants to splurge at
4
Celebrated my birthday there and my husband and I really enjoyed the food as it was a level up version of local dishes with premium ingredients. It was an interesting experience for us as we slowly savory what is in front of us and we felt stuffed after the meal
4
I had their lunch menu, which was one of the more interesting meals I've had this year. From bak chor mee that tastes like one but made without its usual ingredients, to an egg dessert with sesame sauce resembling kopitiam-style soft-boiled eggs (but is really mango sticky rice and sesame), the meal was kept exciting from start to finish
5
Absolutely loved my dinner at Labyrinth - I'm a fan of fine dining and molecular gastronomy and would still class this as one of the best meals I've had. The service was excellent, food was very clever and delicious. Certainly deserves it's Michelin star - I would even say more than one
5
Fantastic experience and very unique concept to local Singaporean food. I rang the restaurant 2 days earlier to check on the menu and mentioned we were celebrating my partner's birthday and the restaurant served us a cake with a candle at the end of the meal! That was really unexpected and a very pleasant evening. Thank you Josep
4
We celebrated our 12-year old nephew's birthday here. Creative food and a treat to our eyes and palates. Service is good and the birthday boy was given a birthday cake FOC. His mocktail was also on the house.
5
Impress by the unexpected dishes and the creative creation of Asian cuisine. I loves the yummy soft shell crab, "bak chor mee" and the roasted pork belly with siew yoke umami rice.
4
This was my third dinner at the restaurant, delicious new menu, good service and i think the chef is a genius, so creative in his interpretation of local favourite dishes. The bak chor mee, the nasi lemak , chicken rice... every dish was elevated to a deliciously higher level. Our Australian friends loved the retro touches
3
Went for lunch after knowing about the Michelin Star. Affordable, but very limited choices. Not a fan of most of the lunch items simply looking at the menu. For those that I usually go for, tastes ok, not fantastic. Dinner menu seems much more intriguing, need to visit again
5
We went to Restaurant Labyrinth before a concert. Restaurant Labyrinth is located in an understated corner inside the Esplanade in Singapore. Chef LG Han used his creative juices to re-create many of the Singaporean dishes and delicacies... The results were phoenomenal!!From chicken rice dumpling to book chor mee to his chilli crab... Each dish was very well thought out and delicious. I would, however, suggest diners to go try the "original" versions before heading to Restaurant Labyrinth. That way, you will truly appreciate what LG Han's creativity and his originality.
5
A good take of Singapore's famous and iconic dishes. The chef played with texture, sight and temperature. A witty and successful attempt. Recommend tourists and locals to visit this restaurant. I like the signature chili crab and pen cai risotto. So good I wished there was more.
5
Wanted to come here for the longest time, even before they earned their Michelin star, but for some reason I kept putting it off. It was a very pleasurable experience to have lunch at Labyrinth. Service was great and the food presentation on point. I was bummed that they discontinued the ‚ÄúXiao long bao‚Äù dessert. This restaurant is like a savory version of Non Entree Dessert. Already planning another visit next month
4
The restaurant i in a mall in Esplanade area, directly connected to the theater. The room is nice, but there is no view on the city or something that can give an added value to the place.The food is good, but nothing that can really leave a track in your memory. When I go in similar restaurant I always look for something that can give me some emotion, not only to fill my stomach, and this is what I did not find here.All dishes were good, but without that special accent.They have two menu: classic (88 SGD + taxes) and chef tasting menu (148 + taxes). The best dish has been the crab signature and then a good risotto with prawn. Less interesting the beef noodles (also if definitely a good dish).The service was really professional and I have also to say that the cocktails were very good. Maybe I would suggest to add some nice dry cocktail since all the chooses were limited to sweet types.In any case I suggest to give a try to this restaurant,Enjo
4
We had the wine pairing menu. Wine was good, food was more interesting in concept than in taste. Not that it wasn't good, it was excellent. But the taste was just slightly lacking in terms of flavour. And texture.We had the hawker-inspired cocktails too, that was memorable. I personally felt that the Milo dinosaur was a little strong, kaya toast was a little sweet, but gula melaka popcorn was just right. Highly recommend all 3 because all are worth a try.Service was great! My compliments to the crew
4
The experience at labyrinth is as the name suggests like in a maze. Some dishes give you hope that you are nearing the end of the maze but some dishes make you realise it is a dead end only.We went for the full tasting menu incl an additional order of the much vaunted old chang kee curry puff.The hits ;The starters were really good and promising. The rojak was really intense, the nasi lemak dressed as a chwee kueh also woke up our senses.The bak chor mee with its delectable mix of vinegar and chilli and its squid noodles give it a more al dente bite. Enjoyable and we cant wait for me.The misses;Then it started to go downhill. The roast pork was average. The pork was crispy no doubt but the spuces were not complex enough vs the normal roast pork you can find at hawkers centres. The char siew was a definite miss. The meat was too lean and chewy and the spices was too intense like an overzealous chef pouring a whole bottle of char siew sauce onto the pork by mistake. But we felt there isnt mich creativity in these 2 dishes, other than changing the rice to filipino or jap rice...it is still siew yoke and char siew, which we hv a dime a plenty in singapore food courts and hawker ctrs.The ock curry puff was underwhelming. True all the flavours of curry puff was there, the potato, the egg, the curry leaves, the flakiness of the pastry etc but ock curry puff fully loaded sells for $1.50 vs a 1/5 size version at labyrinth that was probably charged at $20. Miniturising a curry puff but upsizing the price doesnt cut it as creativity.The beef hor fun was ok. First the cheap beef was substituted by a4 wagyu beef. Secondly, the hor fun is not hor fun but made if the same squid noodles of bak chor mee. A really good molecular fusion restaurant would never use the same ingredient twice. It smacks of ltd creativity.The kaya toast desert was good though. It may not look like butter kaya toast but mixing in all the alien ingredients, you get that familiar taste of our traditional butter kaya toast.It may not be fair to compare Labyrinth to more established places like Tickets or Disfrutar in barcelona, El Cellar in girona or even the Fat Duck in Bray but Labyrinth being in the Michellin big league shows it still has some more room to work on to make it a more overwhelming restaurant, worthy to be called Singapore's best fusion restaurant
5
location and venue lowers your expectations then the food and service exceeds most of what you've experienced elsewhere. Should be on your list of restaurants to visit in Singapore. Singapore food presented, uniquely, in a fine dining concept. Loved it.
3
Good service and atmosphere is good. Set lunch food portion might not enough for heavy eater though.
5
Definitely worth a visit, which shapes and texture misleading you, the only way to enjoy the food is put it into the mouth, forget about the visuals, and enjoy the essence of the food.
2
Did well in the food department. Took our local food to another level. But the atmosphere did not meet up to that of a one Michelin star restaurant. As a result that brought down the whole dining experience. Pity on that.
5
Really impressed with this one Michelin star restaurant. The food was great and so different from the food I ever taste.
5
We had a lovely experience with the chef tasting and wine paring menu. We enjoyed the taste of singapore hawker food in chef's Han dishes, hidden in a corner at esplanade. Interior is cosy with traces of local touch. Would recommend bringing my foreign friends who are visiting to try the dishes in a setting like this.
5
Restaurant Labyrinth got a one-Michelin star in Singapore. As most people do not know what these stars mean, they would naturally associate it to taste and taste alone.Ambience:Comfortable and intimate setting.Tables are well-spaced out for privacy between customers. The size of the table is sufficient for the restaurant's style of service a couple of dishes at a time. Dining cutlery has a nice weight and feel to it, making the dining experience feel more posh. Drink glasses are clean and spotless.The lights are not positioned to the table (purpose-built) hence you have some tables that are more lighted on one end but poorly lit on the other. Moving forward, it would be great if they can get lighting consultant instead of regular general interior designers.Food:Having been to two 3-Michelin, three 2-Michelin and a few 1-Michelin starred restaurants, I would rate the taste as excellent. In fact, the culinary style of food is similar to The Fat Duck by Heston Blumenthal (Bray, England), where it is more of a culinary wonderland than anything else. These types of restaurants let you discover taste experiences that are out of this world. They play not only with flavours, but also texture and temperature.Honestly, I would rate the food at Restaurant Labyrinth better in terms of taste. It is amazing how they made the "chilli crab" taste exactly the way it should taste but appearing like the a crab on sand, with cold ice-cream. Your mind will be blown away as your brain juggles the totally new experience to a very familiar taste. Imagine that experience, multiply that with the number of dishes as each course will give you a new perspective. It is such a delight.Service:This is where they lacked a lot. One thing 3-Michelin starred restaurants have in common, the service team makes you feel as though you are the VIP of the day. It is amazing how they manage to do it every single time. Despite having other tables, the staff to diner ratio is amazing.The staff at Restaurant Labyrinth is friendly and warm, but it is not too easy to get their attention as they are busy with other diners. They had to be more reactive (instead of proactive) because they are tied down with other tasks that are ongoing at the same time.Overall: From my dining experience at Restaurant Labyrinth, I would have given them 2-Michelin stars as they were not just "the best in their category", but they were "excellent and worth a detour". I hope they work on the staffing, the service level and lighting to improve the experience. The food is simply amazing and it is really worth your money and detour (if that applies to you)
5
Use to eat at the restaurant regularly before they received their Michelin Star. Was a bit apprehensive when I made the booking recently as the restaurant was heavily booked most days and I fear that that their standards might be compromised with the high popularity. My fear was unfounded as the food and service standards was certainly up to expectations . My guest was impressed as well and I certainly look forward to eating there in the near future. Keep up the good work and they truly deserved their star
5
Cosy interior with prompt staff. Courses are interesting takes on local dishes, and priced just about appropriately. The squid noodles and the smaller items like the rojak puffs and the chicken rice dumplings are the main highlights; there's certainly a lot more stuff around for them to play around with, and it would be interesting to see even more variety and experimentation in the future. For now though, certainly any lover of Southeast Asian cuisine and fine dining ought to give this a try.
5
So innovative and great food. Deserved at least one more star. We had bad experience the night before in one restaurant also with Michelin star and was sceptic. But Labyrinth is just great place, combined local food with modern touch. Tea in form of sandwich was awesome, and so was the chili crab. All courses were fantastic. The chef came to our table, nice guy, very friendly. Top restaurant in Sing for sure
5
Good food, ambiance and service at a reasonable price. Cannot ask for more. The only course that had me scratching my head was the dessert: chng tng.. Ask for a replacement.
4
Booked 6pm and was informed that 6pm booking was only allowed to order Lunch Menu... after speaking to the staff, we managed to place our order under Dinner's menu. :) thanks for the excellent service.
4
This is a little upscale restaurant and I went here for business lunch and I must say that the presentation of food was excellent and very creative!! :) The taste of food was also very good. I ate Roasted pork belly for the mains. Tehtarik (meringue) was amazing too
4
My second visit, as with the first, was an enjoyable experience although not all dishes were of the highest standards. This time we went for the dinner degustation. A joint Labyrinth & Le Du (of BKK) collaboration. The 2 amuse bouche were delicious as well as the royale oyster.The flower crab was equally good.But the best dish that evening was the lobster with young coconut. I could have had a second helping.The locally farmed grouper did not have sufficient natural flavors, perhaps as it's farmed along the Straits of Johore. Wild fish always taste better. The crispy scales were not crispy. But the goji broth was excellent! The black chicken with century egg was too pungent. I did not like this dish !The aged tenderloin was good, but would have been better with less salt. For dessert the yam skin shell was far too hard, but I have a bias against tap roots. The surprise dessert was good.Smoked coconut ice cream , mango pudding , coconut lactose shards & lily bulbs. The layering of flavors were both surprising & delicious.And finally the petit four.... immmm...Not good. Too dry. Granted that my review is highly critical, but my bar is always raised much higher for fine dining experiences. Particularly those with Michelin stars. The more stars; the more critical ! But a word of encouragement; I am delighted that a home grown Singapore chef has come out with such innovative creations that have successfully captured the local flavors of Singapore with such sophistication. A well deserved 1 star. But that means you can do better. Alan LeongSingapore

Had dinner at labyrint while visiting Singapore.Great location for the restaurant to be.Food was sensational, good to see classic dishes with a modern twist.For my experience the quality of the service was very poor, with no much attention, As the wine and cocktail list with very limited choices
5
One might only be able to describe Labyrinth's aesthetic creations more as artwork than cuisine.Chef Han deconstructs familiar flavors of local favourites, infuses them into unusual food forms and serves them eclectically to reconcile the tastes with the visual experience.From the mee pok made from squid meat, served in a traditional tuck shop bowl, to the famous chili crab ice cream with tempura style soft shell crab, you would be amazed what Chef could accomplish to bring you on a journey away from home yet back in an instance.The delicate portions are meant to be intellectually dissected and visually reconciled with the tastes, hence to be slowly savoured bit by bit as you discuss the experience with your company.If you want a journey through the best of local cuisine avant garden style rather than a food fest, this is the place for you

1. serviceThree weeks ago, wife booked through Chope, an online reservation facility. Said she is gluten, wheat and dairy intolerant because restaurant's website encourages diners to advise it on such matters. Chef called her. Said that Bak Chor Mee did not feature noodle but squid. Lulled by this assurance, she did not continue with dietary due diligence. On date of reservation, spoke on phone to restaurant employee. Repeated above restriction. He appeared ignorant. Arrived. Was shown table. asked whether dietary restriction was clear. Waiter/captain said, "no record". All however, were polite. First course featured gluten including Chwee kuay and chye tau kuay (which were hard). Generally, base/pastry featured same attribute although filling was tasty enough. Subsequently, wife had to endure abdominal cramps. 2. food Appreciated creativity put into texture, taste and fillings. Especially squid in lieu of wholly hor fun for a base (wagyu beef). Also liked local taste of brown sugar in ice cream and caviar with kaya on bread.Nonetheless, I felt that emphasis was on presentation and not what underlies my overall dining experience. Usually, i emerge from a meal without allergy reaction from my wifeWhile I am grateful for chef's call to my wife prior to dinner, i would have been more appreciative if he had acted in entirety on her dietary restrictions. Was this, "A bridge too far for him and team?" I wonder.Daniel We
5
We've been for both lunch and dinner. The food is outstanding! The flavours are amazing and makes me want to learn even more about Singapore's dishes, plus the presentation is gorgeous and photograph-worthy.Looking around the dining room, everyone was delighted when the food arrived at their table.Importantly, the service is excellent. They were helpful with explaining how dishes could be made for the food intolerances (dairy, gluten) when I asked, as well as explaining everything as it was presented, along with helpful suggestions about how to eat it!Lovely and quiet with super comfortable chairs, if noise levels matter to you.Highly, highly recommended
5
We found this restaurant by chance online when looking for a restaurant serving local food to have dinner in - it didn't disappoint. We had the set menu with wine flight which was excellent value. Food is amazing with some great twists - the chilli crab starter is delicious and very clever, as was the rest of the meal and there is great attention to detail with presentation and flavours used. Staff were great too, explained the dishes and wines and were attentive without being overbearing
5
I normally don't write reviews but the experience I've had here is definitely one of the best. Already came across many good feedbacks coming from people who have been there and Labyrinth didn't disappoint.The food was excellent and the service top class. With the restaurant earning their first Michelin star only recently, you have to expect the crowd. But rest assured that the staff there will always give their best to make your experience a pleasant one. The chilli crab dish was mind blowing.A big thank you to all the staff at Labyrinth (especially Jo, Helmi and Randy) for the wonderful experience =

I had the Chef's Tasting menu at a recent visit to Restaurant Labyrinth which I thought was sheer genius. The signature chili crab ice cream dish and kaya and caviar dessert were my favourites! All in all a very memorable dining experience!!
3
Some dishes were good, like the moonlight horfun and roast pork rice. Milo dinosaur and gula melaka cocktails were good too. Rest of the menu was not as good as anticipated.
5
I went for the lunch set menu and it was great and is a good introduction to what the restaurant can offer. Good fusion of local delights into modern bite-size menu. Great job.
3
Please note the crab (does not look like a full crab as in the picture) and there is no umbrella! Portion sizes disappointingly small.
5
I have been twice to Labyrinth restaurant. The staffs are professional, friendly and well knowledgeable. The food is wonderful! Well deserved to receive a Michelin Star!

Love the thoughts n heart put into the creation of every individual dishes... yummy with an Asian twist, interesting & wonderful service. would highly recommend them. Thumbs up!!

I held a dinner for my conference attendees here. My guests from various part of Asia Pacific were super impressed by the visual presentation and the taste of the food they had at Restaurant Labyrinth.It's a great way to showcase Singaporean food with a stylish and unexpected twist. Th service was impeccable too. Definitely the place to be if you want to impress some overseas guests

Restaurant Labyrinth is known for mod-sin fusion and with my spouse being a local food fan, we are so looking forward to the celebration dinner. However, some dishes were a hit and miss. Eg, mango sticky rice, Pen cai risotto and the waygu beef hor fun.Restaurant was crowded. To add on to the crowd, there is an event on going, resulting the whole place to be noisy and with many guests walking around. Pretty disappointed as the restaurant was just awarded with their first Michelin Star and we were really exciting in tasting the food. but it's really not a great dinning experience

Visited Labyrinth Restaurant on 19 Jul 2017. I had the Chef's Tasting Menu for dinner. The whole menu was a mind blowing experience. a very innovative skill to chef LG Han. The whole dining journey is base on a story line. (From Brunch - Snacks - Lunch - Snack - Dinner- Supper - Breakfast). The service team is attentive and friendly. well deserved 1 micheline star
5
Look like we have to share our favourite restaurant with hordes of other diners now that Labyrinth has earned their first Michelin star. Lucky we had booked our table before the announcement of their Michelin star award as it was packed with diners even during lunch. However, we were glad that their usual excellent food and service remains intact . Looks like moving forward we had to make advanced booking many weeks should we want to snag a table in the future. The set lunch was certainly value for money and hope they will not raise their prices soon with their popularity now going through the roof. My guests were certainly enjoying their dishes which were both a treat for the palate and the eyes as well. All them were certainly thinking of coming back to try the chef's tasting menu for dinner which was what all the diners were raving about. Although we are happy for the restaurant for being recognised by Michelin as a dining destination it means that now the secret is out and we will have to share the restaurant with may others.

Few meals were creative, some other was just basic. But the welcome was not very friendly, we could not seat at the table until everybody arrives while the restaurant was far to be full.
5
Wife's birthday, Cosy and nice! Good service and good food! Totally enjoyed the experience.
Had a chat with Han after that! Nice bloke!
5
This restaurant is difficult to find but worth the hunt. The food is brilliant. We had the set menu and each dish was not only delicious and perfectly composed, but it was presented as art. The staff were professional, lovely and attentive. Highly recommend.
5
The new menu is fantastic. Must try. The new menu is not purely focusing on molecular gastronomy but on flavors and local produce. Good evolution from the previous classic menu
5
Chef Li Guang and his team has truly done us Singaporeans proud. Witty and highly creative with impeccable attention to details! What you see may not be what you are actually eating! Almost every dish is packed with surprises. They are packed with authentic flavours with wow element! In short, this experiential dining is spot on and divine! Theres Gaggan in Bangkok, we have our very own Chef Li Guang in Singapore! Service can still be improved. Had a couple of frantic hand waving moments and a couple times I had to repeat myself. Atmosphere is very good. The seat I got was good. But I reckon it could do with a little bit more space or privacy.I will definitely continue to rave about this experience! Well done

Located at the far end of a corridor, under the durian canopy emerges discreetly the Labyrinth. The atmosphere is comfortable but sombre as the name of the restaurant would suggest. We had the lunch/pre-theatre 6 course menu, where the first 2 dishes were reconstructed Singaporean street food, delicately presented yet with explosive flavors that aroused the senses. These 2 were definitely winners. The main course also did not fail to impress, where the prawn risotto was made to perfection. I would bestow accolades to 4 out of the 6 dishes. At $48 +($10) the set was a bargain considering the complexity of the execution, & where I look forward to my next meal in a month or so. Alan LeongSingapore
5
Came here for the lunch tasting menu and whilst the restaurant was empty at the time the atmosphere was still inviting and not awkward as an empty space can be.The food they are serving is not just fine dining but you get the sense that the chefs here are actually working hard to experiment with ideas and flavours. Everything is as surprising as it is deliciou
5
My husband and I had dinner here and did the classic degustation tasting menu. We read all the amazing reviews and were not disappointed - the food was absolutely AMAZING! Everything was presented beautifully and we loved how the chef took you through the different districts of Singapore with his dishes. You can see how much soul and personal experience he has put into this menu and it is so unique and special. We only had about 36 hours in Singapore so it was a great way to experience all the favorite Singapore dishes. The presentation on the mango dish was especially cool. The restaurant was also super accommodating because my husband doesn't eat meat so they altered some of the dishes for him. We loved it and definitely recommend! The price is steep so save it for a fancy, special occasion
5
What an oxymoron....a fabulously creative fusion restaurant in a shopping mall! I made the lunch reservation for our first day in Singapore. When we got there, we almost decided to leave because the food looked so weird. But are we glad we stayed! We had the five course tasting menu, and diverged on the main course (my husband had the pork belly and I had the tiger shrimp risotto). I can't even begin to describe each course, but the coconut jelly noodles were memorable, the braised duck with consomm√É¬© was probably one of the top five dishes I have ever had, and the shrimp risotto was divine. We enjoyed every course, and the service was stellar. I am so glad we decided to stay for lunch
4
We choose the "4 meal" course...our meal was delicious from the snacks to the dessert.We we're pleasantly surprised by the size of the plate....Perfect size...I always regret the dessert ...with this cuisine...isn't really a dessert....The service was quick, and attentive --the atmosphere is a little bit "austere".....black on black!The decor was passive , not really inviting.---I highly recommend this restaurant .....just for the food
4
Well thought out food presentation and good essence of flavour. Not all to my liking but a good experience nonetheless
5
Am surprised that this place does not appear to be well - known. Food's delicious and very creatively - presented . Staff were nice and friendly, this combination of the service there plus the fine fare will have me returning to this joint !
5
that was my first time been there during Valentine's Day.. overall is above my expectation.. the food is delicious.. the service is awesome.. it is really value for money.. strongly recommended for couple..
4
Food is above average and an innovative menu that is worth mentioning. I would suggest a frequent change of cutleries, a fine detail to improve on but will make the overall experience better. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to others.
5
What an awesome experience! We enjoyed the chef's 11 course tasting menu. Each course was a culinary art piece, both visually and in taste. The fixed menu was emailed in advance to us in case of necessary changes. I went with wine pairing. The meal was a multiple Michelin star experience at a somewhat undiscovered place.

We were recommended by a friend to try this restaurant because of it's unique interpretation of local Singapore street food . I wasn't disappointed by the taste - that was excellent except the seaweed risotto that accompanied my roast pork had lard mixed into the risotto and made it cloyingly sickly after several bites . The roast pork However was done to perfection . The snacks we had ( 1 curry puff , 1 foie Gras lollipop and 3 tiny nasi Lemak Chwee Kway ) were all very tasty but the portions were extremely small and we would have had to double our orders to actually enjoy it but at those prices ; I don't think so. My partner's main of cod and evaporated milk noodle in ginger broth was very nice but again very small and way over priced at $30 . I would recommend the place just to experience the food interpretation but I would not return .

We reserved the pre-theatre dinner slot before our concert at Esplanade. The style is the food is modern twist of Singapore local cuisine. Overall the quality is good with bursting flavour. However, the menu is not family with kids friendly at all. There is no a la cate for young children as the set menu is too big for them. When we requested to take leftover home, we were told that the restaurant does provide any container at all. In the end, we had to wrap the food in tin foil to avoid the waste. I have not been to a place of such odd and cold way to handle customers. Maybe that is why it is a bit quiet even on a concert night
5
We booked a table in a separate room for our small birthday party. We all ordered a dinner tasting menu with a nice bottle of red wine. Such a nice way to rediscover the local cuisine in a more contemporary way by using molecular techniques. Loved that they had a small booklet explaining each dish and history behind it. Hainanese curry infused rice, deep fried crab puff with chilli ice cream, egg-shell mango panna cotta...it was such an interesting journey of understanding a Singaporean meal. At the end of the dinner we were surprised with a small birthday cake from the chef! The waiter was courteous yet it felt that they might be a bit understaffed. A great way to explore a modern interpretation of the classics.
5
A unique restaurant. A friend and I dined here recently and the meal hasn't left my mind. It's a journey through old Singapore traditions with a wonderful modern twist. Our 14 courses came out at a fair pace, but each was a marvel to behold and savour. For those looking for a different way of looking at old classics, this is a restaurant for you.
5
Great effort by Chef Han to re-create many local delights with such an interesting twist. Every dish is mouth-watering and the best of all is their main course, roast pork risotto / tiger prawn risotto. 3 lunch visits to Labyrinth and I can't look forward to returning again
5
2 dishes in one dish. Sound weird but one must try to understand. Superb and the service was 5 star.
4
Very creative food. Atmosphere can be improved by replacing dated elevator music with contemporary Singapore/asian instrumental music
4
It was a very interesting experience for the both of us. What you see is not what it is (example: chicken rice with no chicken and rice) Delicious food! Love the OCK curry puff and their signature soft shell crab!
5
Excellent service and food. Very creative and clearly the chef is proud of his Singaporean roots. Ambiance could be better though.
3
The hall staffs were nice and kind. Food contains many ideas - but the taste was not so much special.
4
The restaurant was located at the space formerly occupied by Space by TungLok. The place was decorated in all blacks. Besides offering lunch set and dinner sets, the restaurant also offered pre-theatre dinner set ($48++) on thursday to saturday at 6pm.TINGKATradish cake, rojak, nasi lemakThe radish cake was in a cylinder cone with a stick in the centre. Tasted not bad although felt it was a tab plain and wished one could taste shredded radish and dried shrimp in it. The crispy square puff was packed with rojak sauce in it. Interesting pack of flavours. The coconut flavoured chwee kueh was topped with sambal, and reminded one of nasi lemak.HIROSHIMA OYSTERlaksaThe noodle was created with coconut milk and a fat juicy hiroshima oyster was used to replace cockles which was usually found in laksa. The floss was spicy with flavours of laksa.DUCKbraised duck dumplingThe dumplings were served in a bamboo basket with soup in a glass bowl. The dumplings were covered in a transparent skin made of sweet potato. Somehow felt that the filling was over flavoured and covered the duck's flavour.TIGER PRAWN ($10 SUPPLEMENT) pen cai risottoThe fa cai had a light and crispy texture. The risotto was well flavoured with oyster sauce, shiitake mushrooms , beancurd skin, and dried shrimps .XIAO LONG BAO chendolA greenish xiao long bao served in a bamboo basket with gula melaka syrup in a small jar. The green skin was made to represent the green jelly strips usually found in chendol. The xiao long bao was packed with jelly cubes and red bean. Interesting pack of flavours when ate it in one mouthful.CIGARreese‚Äôs peanut butter chocolateThe cigar was a chocolate bar with chocolate creme in it, dusted with cocoa powder, with the bottom part dusted with liquid nitrogen to make look like burn part. It was served in a glass ashtray with peanut crumbles as the burnt ashes. It was accompanied with a glass of earl grey tea with a ball of ice to look like a glass of Cognac. The rich chocolate stick was balanced by the light floral tea.PETIT FOURIt was Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter macaron. It was light and not too sweet.I washed down the meal with a glass of Lychee Martinis ($12++)Vodka, Lychee Liqueur, Lychee Extract which came with 2 pieces of canned lychee and tasted quite sweet

This restauarnt is not in a particularly pleasant location (2nd floor of a shopping mall) with no views, limited tables & not a great deal of ambience.However if you are looking for a very different 'dining experience' with some excellent & inventive dishes then it's a very interesting experience, indeed almost a 'journey' as all the dishes tell a tale!The young local chef creates a number of very unusual dishes based loosely around the concept of 'Singapore Street Food'. Some are absolutely delicious although others don't work quite so well & need a little more refining.We went for the full monty which from memory was 9 courses + the chef's chosen wine pairing. The only real disappointment was the wine pairings, which didn't always work & were also very meagre, indeed we had to ask for (& pay extra for) additional glasses of wine as we kept running short. Be warned not all the dishes come with a fresh glass of wine so quite often we found we had simply run out & had nothing to drink when a new dish arrived! Next time we would simply order a bottle of our own choosing & not bother with the wine pairing.It's also very expensive for what you get. Whilst we didn't go away hungry, we still had room for more at the end of the full 9 courses & could certainly have done with more generous wine servings & with tax & service charge & a bottle of water added expect to pay over SG$500 for 2

i really enjoyed a tasting menu at labyrinth. i'm not sure i understand what molecular cuisine is and whether this was it. dishes were simulations of iconic singapore dishes e.g., chill crab, kaya toast, chicken rice, rojak, curry puff. i've often wondered about cuisine where ingredients are turned into something they are not‚Äîalmost as if to startle unsuspecting diners. but at labyrinth it worked. i thought the restaurant was unpretentious and not gimmicky. joseph, our lovely server, was attentive and informative (without being pompous). i am gluten intolerant and they did an excellent job of providing tasty alternatives when called for (we had told them in advance). my gluten free menu started feebly with a cube of melon topped by parma ham while the others had faux radish cakes, curry puffs, and nasi lemak rolls (all in small, bite-sized portions). but things looked up from there. the second course was delicious with scallops and other dainties on a bed of noodles that were made purely from strips of squid. at another point, my gluten-free substitution had noodles made from evaporated milk. all very interesting and nicely done. i'd love to go back. the ambience was not memorable but pleasant enough. the restaurant is in the esplanade building which is by the water but we seemed to be in a fairly enclosed, dark (admittedly it was at night) space so i'm not sure whether in fact some tables look out on the water
5
We don't visit Asia to have high-end French or Italian food, and sometimes you want something beyond the hawker stands (wonderful as they are). We were lucky to find Labyrinth (located in the Esplanade mall on Marina Bay), which takes classic Singaporean dishes and interprets them in a modern, "cheffy" way. If you're a foodie and want to try something you can't get anywhere else, come here.Service was kind, if not a little rushed (maybe because it was New Year's Eve), but the food was very creative and unique. A great way to end our visit to Singapore
4
Very nice staff, good service and nice ambience, food was great too but in this price range both presentation and value could be a bit better. All in all known Singaporean dishes are reinvented, so I think this is more something for the seasoned Singaporean foodie rather than the tourist looking for a sampler of local dishes, I would recommend but would also welcome some improvements in the presentation of the mains
4
very good service the entire night, the waiters are all very attentive and professional. ideal for dates.
5
Brought several business visitors for lunch. Service was good and efficient. Food was good as expected. Innovative and creative.
5
Labyrinth lived up to its name by taking me to a winding path of delectable of taste and creative imagination. Inspired by various local favourites of Chef Han, i would recommend trying it as least once in your lifetime.
5
Living in Singapore, I love going to the food court. But here you can have same flavours in surprising new ways. You won't recognize your favorite Chicken Rice or Nasi L√É¬©man by eye, but for sure you Will love the taste.A really good experience for all Singapore' s food lovers
2
We were 2 couples going to Labyrinth.We did not have enough time for the degustation menu (148++ a pax) which was recommended by the staff, we went for a la carte.We started with snacks which were extremely small and average.Main were OK, nothing amazing, but it ended up being quite expensive especially for the quantity served.
5
This place came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. I was gorging on hawker food in Penang and by the time I got to Singapore I needed a break, but I was adamant that I must stick to Singaporean. The chef understands food and what the locals want from the street and home food they grew up with, and then he puts in his twist into the food and a pts it's up. The chef came around and spoke to diners. It was a Sunday night and was not that busy. He was gracious in taking on menu suggestions - it's a bad habit of mine and most high-end (esp so called celebrity chefs) do not like being told their menu needs tweaking. 
5
I chose labyrinth mainly for location as it is really close to many of the large hotels. Turned out to be a great choice...every dish was a take on a local classic...but each with an amazing twist. The soft shell crab dish was to die for as was the 'cigar and brandy' dessert. Some nice wines by the glass to
5
Another awesome dinner with friends. This is my nth time dining at this restaurant and it never ceases to amaze me. Great craft and ingenuity from the chef to innovate and always deliver something different and special. Fresh ingredients, fine wines and delectable food, what else can u ask for? Yumms
5
True to name, I had a bit of problem finding the Labyrinth restaurant in a building complex full of restaurants and cultural venues but it's worth persisting. (Just for the record: it's upstairs.)The food is just magical. If Heston Blumenthal were born in Singapore, he would probably be doing something similar. I just say this to give some ideas what to expect because the Labirynth of course has it's very own style and creativity.The degustation type set menu took all of my senses on a journey I'll never forget. In this case, I felt like being a pilgrim, travelling through Singapore for a day, criss-crossing ethnic and social class boundaries in a culinary wonderland.Choosing the matching wines is recommended. The white wines especially were a match made in heaven. The red was enjoyable but I would've chosen something else. I suppose this often comes down to personal taste.Service is impeccable with pleasant friendliness. They also appreciate feedback and during a quiter moment, even the head chef may visit you.I always appreciate businesses, and particularly restaurants, where every member of the staff is passionate about what they are doing and totally dedicated to their job. Usually, it's the weakest link which sets your overall opininon and in this case, there was no such thing.I can hardly wait to visit Singapore again, if for nothing else, to visit Labyrinth.I included a few photos but they don't really do full justice and of course, you can't taste, small and touch it. ...and stop licking your screen!! ;-

The good- The chef clearly has a strong vision for what the restaurant should be, drawing on local Singaporean dishes for inspiration then applying modern techniques to re-interpret them.- His technical ability is excellent, and during the tasting menu you get to experience a wide range of his repertoire, from using squid as hor fun noodles to ice cream replicating the hot-sweet sauce of chilli mud crab.- The food looks good. Instagram-good. Most of the people in the restaurant seemed to be there for the photos.The not so good- Halfway through the meal I realised that the whole experience felt overwrought, and most often delivered you close, but disconcertingly not quite close enough to the original dish. It didn't really seem worth the effort. It's almost as if the chef is too constrained by his vision to step away from trying to replicate flavours, the meal would have been much better if he'd allowed himself to play with his techniques to produce new tastes and flavour combinations, because there is clearly no shortage of talent in kitchen.- The service is earnest but lacks polish. Wine matches are placed in front you already poured in the glass, no introduction or explanation.- Wine list is modular, most of the wines from similar stables, and there didn't seem to be anyone in charge of it on the night I was there.- The dishes came out quickly, I got through the tasting menu in under an hour and it was only 3/4 of the way through they thought to check if they were moving too fast. As it was I was happy to finish, but if it moved as quickly for other tables looking for a romantic night out then it would be way too fast.OverallThe flavours are good, don't get me wrong. The techniques are interesting, and the dishes no doubt photograph well. But I kept feeling like I would have preferred to have the original hawker dish rather than the silver service interpretation, aside from technique there's not much else that's been added that really lifts the dishes. Would love to see the chef try to shift away from such a constricted format and taste the results then

Labryinth kindly arranged the pre-theatre menu for us even though they only opened at 6:30pm on Wednesday and wouldn't normally offer it. The food was so inventive and delicious. A much-more affordable version of Tippling Club's molecular gastronomy with a cool Asian twist.
5
No complaint.
I visit with the restaurant together with my parents, my wife, my eldest son, my sister and her eldest daughter. All of us were very exciting with the culinary presentation, the story narrated by the Manager, and the restaurant atmosphere.
5
Mind-blowing. Our experience was absolutely MIND-BLOWING. We had the 13-course discovery menu, and every course was a celebration of the senses. Local Singaporean flavours reimagined and remixed into something modern, innovative and totally out of this world ... For example, biting into the "Lardo" ball released an explosion of quintessential chicken rice flavours, without the chicken, or the rice. Astounding. We were completely and utterly impressed by Chef Han's creativity and knack for creating complex flavours in non-traditional mediums. If you're familiar with Singaporean flavours, this restaurant is a must-try to experience them in a whole different way. It was also nice because Chef Han was in the dining room, stopping to chat with diners. A very friendly guy, and so passionate about his craft. This was truly an unforgettable experience. We will definitely return on our next trip ... I'm already looking forward to it. The pictures are of:1. Tingkat - inspired by radish cake, rojak and nasi lemak 2. Hokkaido scallop - inspired by bak chor mee (minced meat noodles)3. Lardo - inspired by chicken rice balls 4. Smoked bone marrow - inspired by beef rendang5. Hamachi - inspired by sheng yu and Cantonese pork porridge6. Spices - inspired by curry puffs7. Foie gras - inspired by Peking duck8. Soft shell crab - inspired by chili crab9. Seasonal oyster - inspired by orh luak (oyster omelette) 10. Cod - inspired by XO fish noodle sou

Went back again and with foreign friends who were amused with the food. Restaurant mains the quality of food and my favourite dish was the lollipop foie gras Peking duck, and the dish with jap Wagyu! Place seems more crowded than before which I guess adds to the ambience. Dinner was a bit Long at 1.5-2 hours but I Guess that's normal for a 8-9 course meal? Not sure...Nonetheless, the highlight were the bespoke drinks we got on the house (maybe cuz we spent too much on wine!) which were really nice. Staff was more chatty than before.Would go back again. Not every month but perhaps once a quarter. Glad they are launching ala carte menu in November 2016.
1
After all the rave reviews online, my friends and I decided to try out this place. We were greatly disappointed because the quality of food was poor and the seafood was not fresh. We were taken aback by the strong smell of foie gras (nothing that we have tasted before, in a bad way). We would have rather spent the money on $3 bak chor mee, $2 Old Chang Kee curry puff, $3 chicken rice, etc. Honestly, the local flavours were mashed up in cheap ingredients. It was a good idea that was poorly executed. We left deeply unsatisfied and it didn't help that the service staff were neither concerned about our leftover food, neither were they concerned about our complaints (i'm sure they heard us). For the amount that we paid, we really would have expected better quality of food, and a much better quality of service
5
This is my 5th visit to Labyrinth and they improve with every single visit. Service is noticeably tweaked to make the experience better. The courses are coherent and tells a great Singapore food story. Dishes that we fancy include fish porridge, curry puff, bak chor mee, pekin duck and moonlight horfun. Dishes that needs work in our opinion is fish head bee hoon and beef rendang (too spicy). As usual, desserts are always a crowd favourite and this visit did not disappointment. Given the many dishes, excellent techniques and ingredients used, 158++ for the experience menu is a real steal. All of us were stuffed when we stepped out the restaurant. A must visit for all hawker centre foodies
5
Had lunch at Labyrinth with a business associate. Labyrinth is located at the quiet area of the Esplanade and we enjoyed free parking during weekday lunch period. My associate was very impressed by the innovative interpretation of the local dishes such as the Hiroshima Oyster "laksa" and the Xia Long Bao "chendol". I had the pork belly "siew yoke umami rice" as the main course and the pork belly which literally melt in your mouth heightened by the crispy pork skin. My associate had the tiger prawn "pen cai risotto" and was impressed. The set lunch is reasonably priced for what we get. I took a peek at their new dinner menu and certainly looks very interesting for me to find an excuse to come and try them. Labyrinth is the kind of restaurant you should try if you are looking for something innovative yet tasty and wows your imagination
5
An expensive indulgence. But if you are a foodie and you love our local cuisine, you're going to love this degustation experience. We went for the 13 course and we weren't disappointed. We added their wine pairing and it was perfectly paired. I loved the rojak. You bite into this morsel of a pastry and you are hit with rojak flavours immediately. Brilliant. Similar twists on chicken rice, peking duck etc. The teh tarik on toast was a real surprise. All in all it was an excellent experience. We were celebrating a birthday and they provided us with a complimentary cake that was so very delicious. Staff were very friendly and accomodating and the ambience suited the menu
5
The concept of neo-Singaporean cuisine was unique. Every dish on our "Discover" menu was delicious. And the presentation was exquisite. To top it off, the staff who serve us was knowledgeable about the dish and their suggestion on how we should enjoy/eat the food really helps with the whole experience. I'm throughly impressed!
4
Went there with a few Singaporean friends. This is their first time to try it too. They have just moved to this esplanade mall where it is a quite place. The service is good and the idea is to try their courses from breakfast till supper. The chef did try hard to make each course very special but I may find it trying too hard for a few dishes, the starters are good where the only course I don't quite enjoy is the main course with chilly sorbet and deep fried crab.In general, it's a quiet place for you to talk to your friends and the courses are unusual, it is around sgd98 to sgd158 per person
4
Staff was friendly and helpful. Was there for a lunch (set lunch) and place was quiet. Food presentation great and flavorful.
4
very interesting experience, good atmosphere. Service is great. Cost is a bit on the high side given the portion and the ingredients
4
Pleasant surprise in edgy interpretation of local flavors. Service was prompt due to nature of pre theater
5
Tried the new lunch menu with my French colleagues and they were blown away. Every dish had a flavour different from what we saw, and the dishes were extremely well thought out with the Flavours blending so well! Love it. Will be going again.
5
This restaurant is a cut above, even in a city like Singapore where there are so many good places to eat. The chef interprets local cuisine in extremely creative ways (eg chicken rice with no chicken and no rice!). There is a core tasting menu to which you can add a small set or a larger set of dishes for a supplement. The wine pairing is a very good deal and given the huge variation in taste from one course to the next, well worth it so that you get a nice match. Service is polished-- my only issue was that the courses followed one another too fast. There was no time to linger.Finding the restaurant (at least for a visitor to the city) is not so easy - you need to go through the mall on the first floor all the way to the stairs at the back or go around to the esplanade water-side; then go up to the second floor and wind around to the back of one of the passageways. Took me a while to find it and the sign posts are not very helpful
5
We have been to a few performances at the Esplanade, and with performances starting 7:30/8:00pm you dash from work, grab a quick bite for the show - generally never feeling very satisfied before seeing a show. In the past it's often been the food market outside the esplanade, or the bay facing ‚Äúhigh street‚Äù equivalent.This week, we were astonished to try a surprise disgustation pre-theatre menu. Getting there at 6pm, we had 6 courses - each dish was a taste feast, full of suprises, perfect size portions (in context we are not big eaters) & with interpretations on distinctively Singaporean cuisine.You didn't feel rushed, and with the huge bonus of taking a 10 second walk (literally 10 seconds) around the corner to the show entrance, it made a real difference to an evening to have great food, really scrummy food, the sort that sits in your memory and text your friends about. It reminds me of those occasions where you go from the airline lounge and then meander to your seat, without the hussle/bussle/rushing about with the crowds!!Food was wonderful - the kind of places in London where you would have to make bookings in advance!, but I must mention the service was also outstanding. I half expected my ‚Äúchai tea latte‚Äù to be confiscated; however Joseph kindly let me enjoy the final few sips. This is not BYO, and I was totally aware it was a no no, but to have unexpected flexibility, with a smile/wink, bit of thoughtfulness and kindness goes a long way in my book. If word of mouth is the best recommendation, then Labryinth is both excellent food and excellent service that should be shared with friends and family. We don't usually go to the Esplanade for dining unless we are there for an event, however I will most definitely take guests just for the restaurant experience & cuisine.ps: This sensational pre-theatre menu COST was similar to a London west-end/covent garden average meal before a show, however your expectations are completely exceeded by the inventiveness and flavours
5
There are standard menus to choose from - depending on the numbers of courses that you like, be prepared to wow your taste buds. Dishes are all creatively presented and flavours intertwined. A pre-show menu is also available but do make reservations early to avoid disappointment. Worthy dining experience

Serving carefully curated and painstakingly prepared dishes inspired by local dishes, this interesting restaurant redefines the whole dining experience. Waiters are attentive and make it a point to explain the composition of each dish and how it can be enjoyed. Their pre-concert set meals are reasonably priced and well put together, giving one a sampler of what they offer. Unforgettable

I was looking for something different, Singapore has a lot of fine dining experiences that feature French cuisine... I wanted something, well, Singaporean. That's how I stumbled across this restaurant.The setting is lovely, though some of the lighting a little bright (I suspect this is so you can truly appreciate the presentation). The staff friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the dishes.We entered a journey through a 24 hour period in Singapore, each dish representative of a meal eaten by the locals, with a twist. This was a food journey, an exceptional journey with similar tricks you would expect in a Heston meal.The wine pairing worked, I would have liked an explanation of the pairing, but was happy with the quality.A must do if you're looking for fine dining based on Asian cuisine

I just went to labyrinth this evening alone at about 830pm and even though they informed me it was already past the last order, they would make a special request to accommodate me since I was alone (they were probably sympathetic). That said, best meal I've had in a long time! It was a bit pricey and not a place I would come once a week, but the food was really remarkable. The chefs play around with texture and presentation, and I really enjoyed each new dish I tried because seeing it and tasting it were two entire things!I personally will bring some friends down for another meal, and look forward to them changing the menu :) P/s - had a beer at the bar after that which was pretty sweet too.

This Singaporean's fine dining menu is full of surprises. I would go back to Singapore any day, just for another spoonful of that scrumptious chili crab ice cream duo.
5
Tonight we had dinner at Labyrinth and quite amazed on the different shape of food fully inspired by local food. Service was good and ambient was nice also. First time to taste this kind of cuisines. Very unique.
5
It was an eye opener for us. The food was creative, service excellent, and overall a great dining experience. We appreciated the effort put into all aspects of the meal.

This is Singaporean food like you've never thought before. We had the dinner Discovery menu with the supplement - well worth the add on. Highlights, imo, were the squid bak chor mee, signature chili crab, or luak and the 'runny egg' dessert. Downsides - some lobster pieces were a tad rubbery, and the chef was perhaps a little too heavy on the oil (staying true to hawker food I suppose?). Overall, a very fun experience, attentive and pleasant service, though ambience wise it could've been brighter and the tableware a little less dated
3
Expectations were quite high after reading the reviews. The food was beautiful being in hospitality we enjoyed every bit of it.The Maitre'd was a bit arrogant not a smile on his face! cleared my plate before i finished and hurrying us up on a friday night. The restaurant was not that busy. All the other staff were lovel

This review is a little late, but Labyrinth was an awesome start to the foodie year. Chef Han is one of a kind. He takes classic Singaporean favourites like Bak Chor Mee, Chilli Crab and Kaya Toast and turns them around of their heads! You'll never imagine the inventiveness he comes up and this is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore.Before your meal even starts, you‚Äôre served up quirky, cute ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù in a tiffin, inspired by local breakfast dishes of kaya toast presented as mini macarons and chwee kueh infused with coconut flavours. Next up ‚Äì bak chor mee. Chef Han turns the dish around on its head, but not in a bad way. For the purists in the house, well, it might be sacrilegious not to have any bak (pork) in the bak chor mee, but wait till you try this version. The ‚Äúegg‚Äù noodles are strips of squid while the pork has been replaced with dried anchovies. And no fish cake ‚Äì it‚Äôs perfectly cooked scallop instead. The other dish I really loved was the Chili Crab. Again ‚Äì no sauce for the crab to swim in nor those deep-fried pillows of heaven known as mantou bu this dish shines. All thanks to the chili ice-cream, the taste of which is exactly like the sauce you usually slurp up with mantou. Except here, the mantou has been decimated to breadcrumbs but yet again, mix it all up and it works. Desserts were a highlight too. Along came two plump dumplings with a tiny jar of vinegar, and being a xiao long bao addict, I was getting ready to get my ginger on..but nope. It was a Chendol XLB instead, that you‚Äôre supposed to drizzle the vinegar (which was actually gula melaka) and pop the whole thing in your mouth, at which point, all the red bean and coconut spheres will burst delightfully in your mouth. I've been to many Singaporean fusion restaurants but most just fall flat. Labyrinth? Absolutely wonderful
5
And lunch was incredible! Dinner was 3 options, 8, 11 or 15 degustation sized items. We went with 11 and that was plenty! The food was fantastic, even the things I don't really like foie gras, was fantastic. But the signature dish, the soft shell crab with chilli crab ice cream, is amazingly interesting. The presentation is incredible, and all of the food is very carefully thought out.
5
The dinner was an eye opener with many interesting dishes which wowed on several factors. Chef Han re-interpreted local cuisines, presenting a series of gastronomy right before our eyes. Some exceptional ones include the mango sticky rice, totally resembling soft boiled egg; the lardo which looked like an innocent tofu but actually tasted like chicken rice; the very deceiving bak chor mee which comprised of make-to-look-alike ingredients! Very ingenious concept, there's no words to explain except to try for it yourself
4
Interesting degustation restaurant where the emphasis is on presenting local dishes with a twist - usually something that tastes like it but isn't, or looks like it but tastes different. The highlight of our 14 course meal was the cod - delicious, and the mango sticky rice dessert served from a whole raw egg cracked at your table (very clever and won't spoil the secret). Not cheap but certainly a culinary experience
2
Had the set lunch, portions were small, no bread. Feel that restaurant seem overrated for many excellent reviews - potential Michelin star restaurant and one of the restaurants that all foodies in Singapore must try. For a set lunch that cost $50++ the ingriedients ain't worth the cost - the set lunch at wild rocket certainly more superior and cheaper than this place for local based type of food.Service was not fantastic for a fine dining restaurant. When I requested for the meal to finish within 45 min, the waiter said it is difficult without trying to check and get back to me.The waiter knew that we were in a rush and yet delayed the serving of the petite four which I suspect they were anticipating me to leave without trying it. The main dish weren't well executed roast pork was too hard and not crispy and tasty enough, prawn was overcooked. But have to give credit for the creativity and innovations for putting using local flavours in the form of fine dining esp the cigar tasted like magnum icecream but it looks pretty cool. The idea and innovations for the dishes are great but more work need to be done on the power of executing the dishes and also the service. Will be a long way to work towards getting near a one star Michelin. I suppose the prices should be more affordable too
5
Highly recommend. Very creative and attentive. Modern Singaporean food. Very fun and innovative. Looking forward to more creations
5
Every local classics made with fusion touch! Tastes of the food-court meet gastronomic cuisine! Amazing
5
Brilliant, well presented food with style inheriting from the basics of Singaporean dishes with excellent twists
5
Absolutely amazing..the creation and taste was something I have never seen before. Highly recommended
4
Had lunch with a client here. It was a set menu. Had interesting interpretations of some local favourites which were quite good. Service was excellent but portions were a little small for the price.
3
This was my splurge meal in Singapore but ended up falling a bit flat. I was intrigued by the idea of modern Singaporean food. To the chef's credit, the flavor of every dish was spot on, even though they looked nothing like what they're called. However, small elements here and there made the dishes less enjoyable. For example, the chili crab dish pairs a fried soft shell crab with black pepper and chili ice creams. The juxtaposition of cold and hot is usually exciting but in this case it highlighted the greasiness of the fried crab. Also the black pepper ice cream had a strange aftertaste that was slightly nauseating. Similarly, a perfectly cooked scallop was coated with a fried coating that added nothing to the dish. It would have been much better if the scallop was merely caramelized in the pan. I was blown away by the presentation of the "egg" dish (won't spoil the surprise). it's definitely a different experience from the usual food scene in Singapore, but for a visitor with limited time, I'd probably stick with more traditional food options.
3
the servings were small for the set lunch, left hungry. starter was interesting and nice. XO fish noodles didn't quite have XO i think, needs to be less sour. the desert was a mismatch between tea and chocolate - i didn't quite get the combination although I understood the concept of its presentation. service was cold, wait staff were probably trying to put on the 'cool fine-dining personality', but great service at top restaurants is about attentiveness infused with warmth and humility. very excited to have a place that is experimenting with the mod Sin fusion fine dining concept, please continue to innovate and improve
4
It was our first time to Labyrinth and we really enjoyed our experience there. Service was overall good! Although it's slightly costly, I would say it's definitely worth the novelty. Every dish had so much thought and craft put into it, and that was really impressive. Definitely should try once
5
Located in the Esplanade mall, near the concert hall, this eatery bills itself as Singaporean fusion. Fusion is oft a term that gets bandied around for people just doing weird stuff that isn't often very good. However, virtually everything was lovely, and beautifully understated in terms of flavours. The $48++ set lunch menu was degustation-esque in its serving sizes over 7 courses, but perfect in terms of total food amount. Both of the main courses (which you have to choose from) were lovely, but I'd probably stick with the pork belly, which melted in your mouth with a crispy skin finish. Great value, and a good option to take someone who's visiting Singapore. Only detraction was not getting to try the Chilli Crab ice cream which wasn't part of the set menu
3
Interesting. Word lovely and presented well but flavor not 'balanced'.Over powered by certain elements. Service is good and staff present the dishes well. But not quite the fine dining or as interesting as it would appear. Need a bit of fine tuning on the concept and proposition
5
Amazing interpretation of Singapore's most well-known food, brought to life by passionate staff in a luxe dining environment.
4
When attending any performance at the Esplanade treat yourself to a meal at Labyrinth. The food is fun, tasty and always a surprise. The names are familiar the preparation is always unexpected! I would have liked slightly larger portions in the first two courses.
5
What an experience. Fantastic interpretation of street food in Singapore. Innovative, creative and imaginative. A fun night with excellent service. Wonderful flavours. Can't speak too highly of Labyrinth restaurant.
5
My journey to the Restaurant Labyrinth began through Instagram, just like any other food journey. I first saw the photo of Chef Han‚Äôs twist on my much loved Singapore Chili Crab and made a booking at the restaurant shortly after.Restaurant Labyrinth can be found at the Esplanade Mall as soon as you exit the lift on the 2nd floor. It was located in the quiet area of the mall which added to the air of calmness and mystery of each food that was presented.There are two different dining experiences on offer for dinner which are ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Experience‚Äù. In the latter, customers will be served 9 courses of gastro-art made in the Kitchen Lab of Chef Han. We opted for the Discovery menu with 6 courses which gave us the additional Hainanese Curry Rice. Before I delve into the food, I have to commend each staff member, who introduced the different types of food presented to us. They were very professional and friendly at the same time.6 COURSES DISCOVERY MENU AMUSE BOUCHEWe started with the Street Snacks of Radish Cake, Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter, Rojak and very smooth Nasi Lemak that was served in the Rantang or metal food carrier.I really like the smooth Nasi Lemak that was served like Chwee Kueh with sambal and anchovies as toppings. The savoury radish cake had a crispy edge and was very fragrant, it looked just like a toasty marshmallow. The next Amuse Bouche that we had was the most beautiful keropok / prawn crackers that was injected with squid ink. This keropok was topped with mayo chili and beautiful orange fish roe and edible flower petal. BAK CHOR MEEBak Chor Mee is a popular local dishes and I usually love the distinct flavour of the chili and sourness that comes from vinegar. The Neo-Sin‚Äôs version was noodle created from the squid skin served together with anchovies in the shape of minced meat and Hokkaido Scallop that looks like a fish cake. It was a miniature version of Bak Chor Mee that you could find in the local street market. You need to mix everything together to get the best flavour. This cute looking Bak Chor Mee was served on a small bowl with rooster on it, a popular bowl that brought out nostalgic feelings of eating street food during my childhood period.HAINANESE CURRY RICEThe miniature forest with bird ness and quail egg looked very magical when the staff served it in front of me. The green moss looked very delicate and who could guess that it was made from coriander. The white clay that covered the potato was imported from Spain, the ‚Äòblack rock‚Äô minced chicken was very delicious and everything was put on the bed of quinoa curry. Again, it‚Äôs very important to mix in all the elements to gain the true flavour. This was simply my favourite dish of the night, in terms of look as well as the strong spicy flavour that it gave. SINGAPORE CHILI CRABThis was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it. The chili ice cream was delicious, even when eaten by itself! It was moreover really delicious when mixed together with the soft shell crab. Presentation of each dish really mattered and it showed from the choice of plates that the restaurant used. This dish was presented on a light blue plate that resembled the sea, covered with mantou sand, some caviar, seaweed and foamy crab bisque.SATAY BEEFHubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the ‚Äò80g‚Äô next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big. The Wagyu Ribeye was cooked medium rare, served with gnocchi (onion), satay espuma and rice cakes. The rice cakes in this case was peanut mocha which was skilfully wrapped in banana leaves. For me, the beef was perfectly cooked and with the exact amount of layered fat to make it so enjoyable.XO FISHThe fish of the day was red garoupa with a hidden lobster claw served in the Teochew broth. This dish really reminded me of seafood gumbo although not as thick and heavy. The broth was quite light, filled with seafood flavour and mushroom. I found it best when I mixed the broth with the cooked tomato that was provided so it gave the tangy fresh flavour onto the mix.NEW ITEM: MINI APPLE TOFFEEChef Han came out from his kitchen and said hi to us. Not only that, he also brought out a surprising new item that will only be released in early April. It deceivingly looked like a mini apple toffee.PINAPPLE SORBETOur palate cleanser was a refreshing house-made pinapple sorbet and I joked to the staff that one spoon wasn‚Äôt enough to clean our palate (hahaha). CHENDOL Xiao Long Bao (XLB)I want more of the Chendol XLB, it was a good start to dessert and the staff was so nice that she helped me take a pour shot by pouring the gula melaka slowly on top of the XLB. For a small item, it was quite rich since it has all the elements of chendol such as red bean, shaved ice and jellies.REESE‚ÄôS CHOCOLATEThe staff playfully asked whether we smoke or drink before he carried out two ashtray filled with a cigar on each. On the other hand, he gave us a glass of Cognac. It was a peanut butter covered with dark chocolate and the Cognac was the refreshing Earl Grey tea.Now the question on people‚Äôs mind will usually be ‚Äòis it worth the money that I paid for‚Äô. For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish.I had a very enjoyable night at Restaurant Labyrinth and so excited that they will add some new menu items soon. I went to the kitchen to thank Chef Han for his delicious food and to tell him that he needs to do a pop up dining in Perth‚Ä¶ or I should just visit Singapore again

Great experience here and you can expect a performance with every dish that comes your way. The chef's creativity in playing with textures and ingredients definitely gives an interesting interpretation of local food. I enjoyed myself tremendously as what you see is definitely not what you get! A must go!! FYI the Chili Crab Ice cream tastes like Macs Chili Sauce hah
5
The chilli crab ice cream makes all ice cream paiseh and all chilli crab humble, according to my husband. You dont need to suffer the stuffy hawker centre nor noisy seafood restaurant to get a flavour of Singapore. Opened by a Singaporean chef, the dishes boasts nostalgia in every dish.Every creation is so unique, even if a minority didn't taste up to standard I wouldn't complain. My husband and I simply dropped in without expecting it to be a fine dining but stayed on as we were attracted by the discovery menu. A fair price we paid, I thought the uniqueness was comparable with my experience at joel robuchon sentosa. Im definitely recommending this to all my friends
5
Whilst on holiday in Singapore a friend recommended we visit Labyrinth so we duly did. It wasn't the easiest place to find but it was well worth the effort. After discussion with our waiter we decided on the 6 course tasting menu without accompanying wines. From our first course to last this was a quite magnificent dining experience. The variety of ingredients and the plethora of flavours were a joy. Each course was delivered and described and enjoyed.We finished with a dish that was saved in an ashtray! A chocolate tube had been filled with Reece's peanut butter and dipped in liquid hydrogen so it resembled a cigar. Magnificent creativity!We will return on our next visit to Singapore and would expect the chef to have been awarded a Michelin star by then.An essential experience for any foody
4
I went for lunch, the restaurant was very empty, so not a vibrant dining atmosphere, but the food more than made up for it. The starters looked amazing and were extremely innovative. If there is anything to improve I'd say that a few ingredients slightly overpowered the majority of other well combined parts of the dish. Main tasted great and desert was again very innovative and good. I had the set-lunch menu. Maybe one or two more option for lunch were beneficial, but I liked the dishes I had. Value for money was good
4
We booked a pair of Experience menu after hearing by word of mouth from friends.wasnt dissappointed by the dinner experience.1-it was a full 9 course dinner with 02 amuse bouse before starter and a sherbet before mains.2-they do lunch (quick 3-4courses) Pre Theatre menu on days when fhere are events and 02 selections Discovery and Experience menu for dinner.3-we had the experience menu + wine pairing($168/$228 + wine pairing)It was I'd say a Fun experience!especially forLocals who would understand the "meaning" and significance of the various "play" of dishes...going from "breakfast" to "supper".The maitre D who attended to us was Joseph and he was excellent!! Not only in service but enthusiasm!! Thank you n pls keep it up.!&TQ for the cake!! Please try it out and I won't spoil the fun here...02
5
I thought my experience at Labyrinth was going to be marred by their very regimented requirement that both my guest and myself had to order from the same menu. There are only 2 to choose from for dinner. When the staff called in the afternoon to confirm my reservation for the evening, the requirement was not mentioned. When the staff took our order that evening, I had wanted the 6 course Discovery menu and my guest wanted the 10 course Experience menu. In the end, so as not to spoil a birthday celebration, we decided on the Experience menu with some annoyance on the inflexibility.But with each dish that was served, all was forgiven and it turned out to be a fantastic gastronomical experience. We were totally blown away! The staff was also very patient with our questions on how each dish (when served) was prepared that captures the essence of Singapore's favourite hawker food.Bravissimo
5
Fantastic food!!
So creative & intelligent!
This was our 2nd visit. Will definitely go back!
Set lunch was good value.
4
Delicious flavours, inventive cooking and attentive service. Ambience a little lacking owing to setting within a mall. Overall a fun experience of some Singaporean classics reinvented for fine dining.
2
Not really upto the expectations. Dishes does not meet the standard or taste. It's expensive but money wasn't really the matter. Just couldn't enjoy the evening. Thanks
5
Really good, tasty food which just played tricks on our perception of our local food. It was really unique and wonderful. Service was tip top as well. Compliments to the chef and servers at Labyrinth.
5
Wonderful dining experience. Love my soft boiled eggs and beef hor fun and bak chor mee and chendol xlb!!!! Thank you for making it a memorable birthday for my husband.
5
We took the 9-course Experience menu - Absolutely delightful creations using flavours from famous local dishes that have been enhanced with the freshest choicest ingredients - the Labyrinth soft shell crab had caviar on it! My favourites were bak chor mee, Popiah and the Chendol XLB which looks like a green dumpling and was just delectable. Century egg porridge is a dessert, beautifully crafted to look like real porridge. It's a shock when it's sweet! Kaya toast has no kaya or toast! It's a meringue with a caramel teh tarik filling. Stylish decor but noisy when it's full. Service was excellent. Our waiter patiently explained every dish in detail which just added to our enjoyment. All in all, an experience not to be missed
4
Although located near the Theatre, this restaurant's shopping mall location is not ideal - an uninspiring "shop" frontage in a retail/commercial setting. Having said that, once inside, the stylish decor and warm welcome by the enthusiastic staff make up for it. We decided on the 6 course set, starting with Street Snacks. Each course was very well explained, beautifully presented and very tasty. The Chicken Rice (love the runny quail's egg), Soft Shell Crab (chilli ice-cream amazing) and Chocolate Cigar (complete with chocolate "ash") were stand-outs!Don't be put off by the location - this is something different and worth supporting!We had a fun night! Thank
5
The presentation of each course is unique, and after proper explanation was provided for every single course, we have nothing but respect and awe for the chef. It is impressive how someone can come up with this idea of food preparation! Simply amazing!Taste, presentation, portion were well-thought.Impeccable service with good sense of humor.A "wow" experience for sure
4
We had the 5 course with no wine pairing. Presentation and technique were imaginative and offered plenty of surprises. Taste was good, but have tried better for the same price.The standout dish was the Chilli crab. I also enjoyed the Bak Chor Mee and Satay steak. The least strong was the Hainanese curry dish (the curry taste overpowers the other flavours).Service was friendly and ambience was good. I feel that locals or those who have tried Singaporean food, generally those with a reference point, will appreciate the chef's dishes the most. I for one enjoyed myself comparing what I was eating to what I knew. Good times.Those unfamiliar with local food will still enjoy it as there is quality to the cooking.Value is debatable. I would go once for the novelty, but perhaps not again in the foreseeable future
4
I have been resisting going to the Labyrinth for a while as my foodie friends are quite divided in their opinions which range from stunning to its just ‚Äònot real‚Äô (and the fact that I cannot afford to squander calories on the ‚Äònot real‚Äô). Having been there I can understand the divided opinions. To my fellow Singaporeans - to enjoy Labyrinth you must go with a sense of innocence, wonder and mischief. You need to taste each dish as if you never had it before instead of subjecting it to an ingredient-by-ingredient comparison. You need to allow all your senses to be engaged. But above all you need a sense of mischief ‚Äì like when you nicked that fruit (stolen fruit always tasted better?). To fellow diners who are not familiar with Singapore food ‚Äì to enjoy the Labyrinth you need to do some homework. It is like walking into an unfamiliar museum or a galley ‚Äì you will only enjoy the surface beauty and not the artistry without some understanding of what you are going to eat (its Singaporean food with one hefty twist).We had the discover menu and it consisted of a amuse-bouche, four main courses and 2 desserts. The one bite sized amuse-bouche (or freebies) consisted of 4 items. It was very amusing start (a bit like falling down the rabbit hole) being a play on the radish cake, kaya toast (no toast !!), rojak (there is a surprise) and nasi lamak (would make my grandmother cry ‚Äì and I will not tell you in anger or delight). Not stunning but for me ‚Äòfun‚Äô. The next course was like meeting Absolem. The dish was called ‚Äòbak chor mee‚Äô - though given that the scallop was masquerading as the fish ball (but much, much nicer) I would have thought it should have been ‚Äòyu wan mee pok‚Äô. Now the key to ‚Äòbak chor mee‚Äô is the noodles and the sauce (balance between vinegar and chili). The Labyrinth turned this around by dumbing down the sauce, substituting the noodles for squid in saffron with the ‚Äòfish ball‚Äô being the piece de resistance (or should I be naughty and say cr√®me de resistance or in Absolem‚Äôs words ‚Äúyou are almost Al mee pok‚Äù). I can see why half of my friends would scream in laugher and the other half in shock. I was amused. The next course I wrote down was ‚Äòhainanese chicken rice‚Äô. I am desperately trying to recall this dish but cannot so it could neither have been that bad or that good. Perhaps we can call this dish the Chester Cat. The ‚Äòchili crab‚Äô though was visually stunning. But for me the ‚ÄòSatay Beef‚Äô was the one dish worth coming back for. There are no sticks, lumps of rice or slices of cucumber but rather a well-hung wagyu in Indonesia style marinade, on a stream of a rather refined satay sauce with a cheeky ketupat. I can see the idea behind chedol XLB but it absolutely did not work for me. It was neither amusing nor visually interesting nor a wow taste. The reese‚Äôs chocolate tastes better but I have to conclude you would not come here for the desserts.In summary, Chef Han is obviously attempting to create a holistic experience engaging the eyes as well as the taste. I think for some dishes, aroma would also help. But what would help most is shifting the restaurant‚Äôs location. Some lovely period shop house would add far more to that fantasy theme that Chef Han is obviously trying to create than the harsh almost kopitiam setting that it currently is in.Last but not least ‚Äì the service was very good
4
Visited recently.
This is an elegant restaurant that serves sophiaticated Singaporean and Asian food at Marina Bay.
One of many good restaurants in the arrea. Try it.
5
Really unique and delicious. Love this place!! Would definitely go back again and recommend to my friends.
5
The food at Labyrinth tasted fantastic and looked even better. Sure it's not cheap, but it was worth it.
3
Visited yesterday with high hopes. Went for five course tasting menu with wine pairing. Interior not worth writing home about. Safe bet wines accompanied uninspiring dishes served in rapid succession by waiters difficult to understand solely due to my lack of english and other local dialects.Gimmicky presentation and dehydrated ingredients topped with a dab of liquid nitro could have earnt them a star 15 years ago. Flavors, wait staff and interior a big let down.Only positive surprise was the signature dish of softshell crab with crab icecream and what not. Thumbs up for that!Stating the bleeding obvious was really annoying. If you are served a chocolate cigar in an ashtray with a iceteacognac on the side do you really need to be told that this cigar is actually not a fine havana hecho a mano but a cigar resembling cookie and this pale liquid is tea instead of rare cognac? This imitates the seabed with suchandsuch crumbles representing the sandy beach and this seafan looking thing here in the middle is actually softshell crab. Really?Price value and worth. Lets not even get started here. Nearly 400 dollars gets you much further in this culinary mecca if spent elsewhere
5
Who would've thought you could turn everyday Singapore eats into fine dining. That is exactly what Labyrinth has effectively succeeded in doing. Dishes were surprising very well re-created using ingredients of fine dining quality to resemble the everyday street eats. Stand out dishes were the pork belly, beef steak, their signature singapore crab with chilli ice cream, congee and soft boiled egg. We had the matching wine with our 9 course meal, which was surprisingly excellent and well paired with the courses
5
From start to finish, manager on shift, service crews and the head chef were on point in their hospitality. To think they repeat the same thing to every customer dining in there, its amazing how they do it with such passion and heart into it. Five star service, impeccable details to the specially created dishes. We left more than satisfied and still raving about it.
4
Restaurant Labyrinth's degustation journey through some of Singapore's iconic hawker dishes was truly magical and the service was perfectly balanced between attentive yett not too formal. I'd recommend it to anyone. Only negative was the serving size of the matching wines, which was a little on the small size and therefore a tease
5
Fantastic restaurant - clever twists on local delicacies! Ideal for those with a penchant for SEA cuisine, flavours and spices. Service was also outstanding, especially with regard to explaining the dishes and their respective inspirations.Price-wise, Labyrinth is not for the faint-hearted! That being said however, the quality of food and service is definitely worth the lighter wallet
5
The restaurant offers an exciting dining experience with a unique take on a variety of Singaporean dishes. Traditional dishes are deconstructed and reconstruced with great pain and mixes textures and flavours in highly creative ways. very curteous and well-informed staff. Overall a great experience, Congratulations Chef Han
5
This is just one of those places where no matter who I take with me, it's always a hit. The inventive dishes are a great way to introduce out of town friends to the SIngaporean palate for those who daren't venture into our heartlands or hawker centres. Recently took another friend who was completely won over by the creativity of this establishment and of course will be back for more. The price makes it such a steal and such great value! Of course, not every single dish was a crazy hit, but there were more than enough hits overall. Room for improvement still, but that keeps me excited and wanting to go back for even more
5
Love the attention to detail in both food and service. Great night! So many impressive dishes and such lovely waiters.
4
Having dinner at Labyrinth was a very curious experience. Traditional Singaporean cuisine has been deconstructed to create quirky dishes with interesting presentations. This might not be to everyone's taste but it is definitely worth going to find out. I grew up in Singapore and love all the old favourites so this made me see favourite dishes in a new light. I found the setting itself, a bit dark and gloomy in spots though. Our waiter was great and certainly enhanced the dining experience with his introductions to each of the dishes
3
Food is too complicated. Each dish could be split into 3 and the offer could be extended to a 15 course tasting menu. These days I prefer simpler dishes which are about the produce. It is important that the waiting staff can convincingly deliver a commentary of the food. I found the staff were polite but they would hang around the table too much and ask about what we thought after each meal. It would have been better of they asked us what we thought after the meal just once. I think the food was more about show rather than the taste. It was well presented but nothing made the food taste exceedingly good. I also found that the blend of ingredients could overpower each other. For example the satay ribeye had nuts which was overpowering the taste of the medium rare beef which was actually good by itself.I am not a big fan of seafood and unfortunately for me the starters were heavy on seafood. As there are only a maximum of 6 dishes maybe a selection of Starters would have been good. I was disappointed by my experience but I suppose it was an econimcalish fine dining experience.
2
Just had dinner here. I appreciate the concept but it tried too hard to be inventive. Taste is lacking. Portions are lacking. Paid 250 SGD for a dinner for two I think it's worth no more than 100 SGD instead. Truly disappointing. Lighting was bad as well. Some parts are too bright, I think it's to compensate the lack of lighting in other areas of the restaurant. Thus some lights are actually bothersome. The decor is off as well for the price range. You can see the carpet and upholstery are damaged. I appreciate the effort into "recreating" Singaporean food but execution really failed
4
OK, chef LG Han is not Heston Blumenthal, but he is also extremely inventive, passionate and loves having fun with food. His molecular re-interpretation of Singapore dishes reminds us of Heston's surprising re-creation of old English dishes. From the reviews, it's clear that different customers have different preferred dishes - my favourite was the flavourful Bak Choor Mee, followed by the Nasi Lemak 'Chwee Kway', Hainanese Curry Rice, and Reese's Chocolate. The Chilli crab was too 'complicated' for me, but others in our party loved it. Certain dishes (eg. XO Fish, Satay Beef, Chendol Xiao Long Bao) lack 'something'. Some (alas, not all) of the service staff are great story tellers - an essential part of the experience here - again similar to the Bray, England establishment. We went on a week night, and there were only three occupied tables. Granted, the location at the Esplanade mall is lousy (many good restaurants couldn't make it here), but that does not do justice to this very promising chef

Yes I'm aware of Wild Rocket and 2AM, but this is absolutely the most far out mod-sin cuisine you'll get today. Lots of liquid nitrogen bits, dehydrated sauces etc. all very fancy and perfect for a date! The standouts were the Squid Ink Paella crackers and the Wagyu Beef "Hor Fun" which was def worth the top up as this was some of the butteriest meat I've had outside Japan (though please don't expect any actual noodles). Some improvement needed in ambience, specifically lighting and music... I also feel the new space may be too large and makes it feel empty even though there were a few groups. But the service was attentive and we even jokingly commented there might be too many staff
5
highly recommended if you would want to try something different from the usual cuisines. what you see is not what you get but definitely something I enjoyed. service was impeccable! paid attention to what our individual food preferences and kept us engaged. servers know the menu and could explain each dishes well (down to the sequence of having them). food was thumbs up and I would definitely be back to try the "experience" menu

We went to Labyrinth for an early dinner prior to theatre. The restaurant proposes a special pre-theatre menu with a selection of its dishes, and ensures you can finish on time for the show. The concept behind the food is to re-create and enhance authentic local dish flavors while providing a different visual and sensory experience. I enjoyed the Orh Luak (rendition of Oyster Egg) and particularly loved the dessert, the Reese's Chocolate, which comes in the form of a chocolate and peanut butter cigar accompanied by its own cognac-looking earl grey tea. On the other hand the Hainanese Curry Rice was not bad but less original and surprising. As for the service it was very courteous and attentive, and explanations of the dishes were well handled. I would recommend this restaurant to whoever is attending a night show at the Esplanade, as a nice prelude and interesting gastronomic experience.
5
Local fare in fine dining style which was accompanied by good service. The meal was enjoyable and explanations were given for each dish but the servers could speak a little more clearly and slowly. Each dish was a special take of a popular local Singapore dish but the highlight was the chili crab sauce ice cream which was unusual but surprisingly very pleasant. The take on laksa was also unexpected and interesting. Desserts were slightly disappointing. The skin of the chendol Xiao Loong Pau could have verb thinner and more delicate. Overall, worth a visit but it is better for one to understand and to have tasted some of the local dishes in order to better appreciate the interpretation of each dish at Labyrinth.

Labyrinth is a special restaurant. It is designed for foodies, not just food lovers. By this I mean people who are willing try and enjoy the experience of tasting combinations of foods that are completely new to them - whether they actually like the taste of it all or not! At first glance, this restaurant seems a bit out of place - in a shopping mall. A peculiarity for such an upscale place is that the restrooms are in the mall down the corridor. I know that's not unusual in Singapore, but still feels odd when you're paying S$300 per head.Moving on from that, the food is very special. While the theme seems to periodically change, it seems oriented around interpretations of typical local Singaporean cuisine. We have the 8 course meal, skipping the wine pairings (which featured Mouton Cadet - yikes!) and instead selected our own wines. Wine list is very limited but we found quality bottles. Between the 8 courses, extensive amuse bouche and a couple of pallete cleansers, you get 11-12 different food experiences during the meal. All of it was very different to anything I've ever eaten. Almost all of it was stunningly good with a couple of absolute duds (worst of these was the attempt of a cereal bar that tasted too much like fish paste). That doesn't bother me too much as I like a chef who is courageous and experimental. Staff was well informed and attentive and pleasant. Decor is modern and attractive. Overall a very positive experience

We came here for the set lunch. The food is pretty normal with some local infusions. The dory tasted bland and mayo ice cream tasted funny. It is definitely not worth the trip and expensive parking at esplanade.
5
One of the best meals I ever had, not to mention the numerous times I was amazed by the presentation
5
Had the 9 course meal, service was excellent and every meal was like an adventure or a story. All in all an amazing meal
5
Love the concept, really loved the food. Service was fantastic too, they took great care of us. Definitely coming back!!
5
This restaurant is fantastic and the service was brilliant. I went with my mum to treat her for her birthday and the experience was absolutely worth the money. I enjoyed the attentions from the staff, never too stressful, just right. Every dish has been explained carefully and the taste.. was simply sublime. We both loved it. Had very good wine pairing and a nice Old Fashioned to end the dinner. They also made a special cake for my mum, which was very lovely! 
5
Came here for the lunch special which was good value, 38++ for a 3 course lunch plus amuse bouche. I usually prefer entrees and desserts but the mains here were delicious, particuarly enjoyed the barramundi with dehydrated crispy kangkong and charred sambal skin. Would highly recommend coming here if you've had your fill of cheap and tasty hawker food and are looking for a modern and creative spin on the same flavours

My husband and I enjoyed our dinner at Restaurant Labyrinth. We had the Experience Menu with wine pairing. All the quintessential Singapore foods are presented, but with a modern, "molecular" twist (don't know of another word to describe it).The Experience menu takes one from breakfast to lunch to dinner to supper and back to breakfast again. We enjoyed our meal because of the unique interpretations and presentations. At every course, we wondered -- what was the next surprise going to be?All of the courses were very delicious. My personal favourites were:- Labyrinth Chili Crab: the cold ice cream (chili crab sauce) against the hot tempura soft shell crab was sublime- SG Supper (presented like Century Egg Congee): it really looked like congee and it had a congee feel in my mouth. The tastes of this dessert went well together -- soya bean milk, tang yuan (for the congee texture), salted egg yolk, grass jelly. Delicious and a visual/taste treat!- SG Breakfast (presented like kaya toast and teh tarik): This also looked exactly like kaya toast and teh tarik, but what an amazing surprise! When you crack open the egg, it looks like a runny soft boiled egg, but its actually chilled panacotta with mango sauce (egg), balsamic drizzle (dark soya sauce) and almond powder (white pepper). This is accompanied by a teh tarik creme brulee. Again, a visual/taste delight. We only had 2 minor gripes -- (1) each glass of wine in the wine pairing was too little. If there was just a little bit more in each glass, it would have been perfect. (2) The restaurant was quite empty when we were there on a mid-week night. But for some reason, they seated another couple right next to us, when there were many other 2-person tables all around the restaurant. This was a little uncomfortable (I'm sure for the other couple too), as we could hear each others' conversations. The restaurant could have seated the couple just 1 more table away, and it would have been fine.But these are really minor gripes, and I would definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone who would like to try a truly unique restaurant.The service was excellent -- very friendly and helpful staff who made us feel welcome and comfortable. And they presented me with a birthday dessert and glass of moscato!A very good experience and we would go back again to try a different menu the next time

I had previously had a excellent dinner experience at this restaurant when they were in their Neil Road premises. Decided to try their new menus at their new Esplanade location which other diners were raving about and I was not disappointed. I brought a business associate to try their lunch offerings which was either a $38/$48 set lunch or their $88 tasting menu. Both of us pick the tasting menu and it was an excellent choice. The new menu is certainly a step up in terms of both taste and visual experience. You must try it to appreciate the efforts made by the chefs in crafting the new dishes and we enjoy the excellent service provided by the service staff. Will certainly come back again to try their new dinner menus which look very promising. The new restaurant lay out is certainly more conducive for corporate entertaining although I personally miss their old counter seatings
5
In labyrinth food is not about art and science. But more than that. The future of cuisine. The unbelievable cuisine. Nothing but a total experience. Visited few months back where my partner introduce to me about the restaurant. Having a few disgust action set menus. Ambience was good. Sit along the food and bar top which allowed the diners to look how the dishes prepared. We had few suggestion for the servers. Service was top nortch, maybe the restaurant was not too busy. We were serve course by course with detailed explain action of each course cooking method as well as the ingredient. Is a MUST try at least once in your life time

Having lived in Singapore for 13+ years, I was not at all prepared for the reinvention of Singapore cuisine that takes place at Labyrinth. The team does a world class job of taking Singaporean classic like chicken rice, laksa and kaya, and turn then into a gastronomic cultural experience.The amouse bouche were well executed, but given what followed I simply can‚Äôt recall their meanings.The deconstructed laksa with delicate coconut noodles, a perfectly sous vide quail egg and night-topping chill ice cream was a real treat. The kicker was instead of cockles, they placed an Hokkaido oyster to bring the saltiness of the sea. What we didn‚Äôt expect was the creaminess of the oyster, and how it would create a sauce for the dish reminiscent of seafood-laden 123 Katong Laksa. I took the pork belly from the short menu, and it was perfect also. The pork was juice, the skin crispy. Here the surprise was the risotto on the base was reduced with Tonkatsu broth, so it too had an earthy pork flavor. I‚Äôm trying this at home!On the table was also the steak option, which was also delectable. The fish with crispy sambal skin was slightly overpowering for the fish, but the flavor was true-to-life Singapore.Now to the real surprise, desert, of course most of the table chose the chocolate, which looked like a cigar, with one end covered in ash, choc soil to indicate burnt tobacco, and was filled with homemade nutella-like mousse. Very decadent and excellent.One of our party had a nut allergy, so the chef whipped up the most surprising dish of the evening. Placed on the table, in a small bowl, was an egg in shell, with pepper jar and a soy sauce bottle indicating the $2 coffee shop breakfast of Singaporean champions. Our guest of honour did well to hold back her shrieks of culinary disdain ‚Äúwhat‚Ä¶an egg for desert?‚Äù while our waiter went around and explained the abovementioned choc cigar. He was totally in on the show, and his theatre was superb.After what seemed an eternity, he returned to her and explained that this was indeed a desert‚Ä¶it was a most tasty mango vanilla panna cotta‚Ä¶all she had to do was pour it out of the egg‚Ä¶showmanship, theatre, and surprise. It was like masterchef meets magician.The service was great, attentive, personal, and irreverent.I would whole heartedly recommend Labryinth to Singaporeans looking to explore reinvention of your old favourites, to tourists looking for a wander down Singapore culinary streets, and to any foodie who just enjoys great food prepared with thought, class, and lotsa love.Having tasted the food, I now understand (as one of my fellow-diners had to explain) that the menu is indeed its own labyrinth, you never know what‚Äôs around the corner. I loved the surprise and the adventure

Started with a Rotschild bubble NV - very acceptable - had the chef's Experience degustation menu, which was delightful but slightly challenging - found the "meusli bar" a big disappointment - staff are great though venue lacks ambience
5
This was my first time trying this sort of cuisine in my 70 years of "experience" and I am impressed. I will be bringing my friends and colleagues to try it again ion.
5
Interesting meal, love that they put in so much effort to design their dishes. Looking forward to go back again!
5
The food was amazing, service was as excellent, diners will be surprised with the presentation and taste of the different courses served. Not going to spoil it for you, go give it a try! Definitely will be back again soon!
5
We visited Labyrinth purely based on TripAdvisor reviews. And we are glad we did.We ordered for a 5-course discovery experience with wine pairing ($148 per person + 10% service charge + 7% GST - not so cheap). The food was visually appealing and tasted great right from the starters to the dessert. The wine pairing added to the overall dining experience which lasted close to 2 hours!What I particularly liked about the food was the restraint in the flavours and the story behind the modern recreation of local Singaporean flavours. We could not decide what our favourite dish was, as everything was excellent. The service was pretty good too and had a personal touch - something you will expect from a top class restaurant with limited clientele. One of the best dinners we have had
5
If you love Singaporean Food and know it well, prepared to be wowed by a different interpretation. The food is so delicious and is a playful twist. All the food was delicious! We went with the Experience Menu ($168 ++) and felt it gave us a really good overview of the food on offer. There is so much prep and fine details that goes into this food you can appreciate the care and effort the staff put in. Everyone there were lovely and helpful. Service was great. Definitely not an experience to be missed
5
You will not be disappointed as Restaurant Labyrinth lives up to all its rave reviews, presenting dish after dish of amazing gastronomic creations that are plays with traditional Singaporean cuisine. Each dish is a twist of Singaporean cuisine, using various ingredients and techniques that gives the dish a unique presentation completely unlike what it tastes like. From nasi lemak chee kueh to dry laksa, chilli crab ice cream to its innovative deserts, prepared to be amazed by the talented Restaurant Labyrinth!
5
Been there numerous times, only get the chance to write my review on this restaurant. When it was at Neil road, it was a small (ca 25 seats) fine dining open kitchen restaurant. It dishes have a haute cuisine twist to Singaporean flavours. Many reviews have already mentioned their signature dishes such as the chilli crab etc. Would like to comment on their desserts. Desserts are prepared meticulously, and a surprisingly finish to the end of the entire meal (esp the Breakfast set).Another thing to mention is also, they are currently also serving lunch sets which are extremely good value!This place deserves to be up there with the top restaurants in Singapore. Always secretly hope that it will remain under the radar so that I can always get reservation
5
introduced to this place by a friend. fantastic local dishes done inmolecular gastro style.service: top notch. very attentive service staff who explained the dishes to us.food: excellent plating and flavor. unique twist to famous singaporean dishes like chilli crab, chicken rice etc. its not over fanciful too, done just right.i visited this place three times,and every time there r new surprises. an excellent place to bring foreign visitors to experience something they will not get elsewhere. price point: very afforable for the number of dishes. ca low hundreds per pax without wine

My wife and I were lucky enough to be given a sneak preview of Chef Han‚Äôs latest menu, and we were absolutely blown away! Being regulars at their old setup on Neil Road, the newest Labyrinth located on level 2 of Esplanade is definitely a step up. Spacious, classy and equipped with a full bar and private rooms, this new venue looks the real deal, with top-class service to match.But what is really impressive is the food! The team at Labyrinth never ceases to amaze, and their creativity stretches our perception of local cuisine to the limit, while at the same time teasing our senses and overwhelming our taste buds with bold and sophisticated flavours. The ingredients in their newest menu (to be rolled out soon) are of the highest quality and they have added some premium seafood and top notch wagyu to their offering. Now let me briefly describe their awesome new menu without giving too much away :) The aim of the new menu, which I have been told, is to provide you with a brand new experience of local cuisine, starting with well-known breakfast dishes, before moving on to lunch favourites, followed by dinner must-haves, supper and then back to breakfast...this is 24-hr eating rolled into one service!First dish was a sampler of some local breakfast delights, but what you see is definitely not what you get. There is carrot cake which looks like bbq-ed marshmallow, a kaya-toast macaroon, a crispy puff filled with rich rojak-y goodness, and my favourite, a nasi lemak chee kuey. Second dish was sambal seafood, which actually looks more like bak chor mee, grilled scallops that look identical to fish cake, topped off with delightful home-made sambal chilli and special ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù made entirely out of squid.The third dish consisted of premium otoro but made to taste like char siew/siew yok fan, one of those melt in your mouth dishes that leave u speechless and begging for more. The next two dishes are their signature mainstays- hainanese curry chicken rice and the impressive chilli crab ice-cream. Their portions have been adjusted so as to leave you with more room to try out the new dishes, but the quality has not diminished one bit. Sixth on the list is a cereal prawn snack made to resemble an Uncle Toby bar, sweet yet savoury with a strong shrimp or hei bi taste. For mains, there is a choice of A4 grade wagyu beef hor fun or lobster hokkien mee. The beef is cooked to perfection and the gravy really tastes like hor fun sauce but is less rich and complements the wagyu and radish horfun perfectly. The hokkien mee is really the best (Boston) lobster noodles I have ever eaten and the noodles is made from pure egg yolk but tastes like glass noodles. What follows is a bak ku teh + pu er tea pearl drink (served in a shot glass) that is packed full of herbal flavours and nicely complemented with silky pu er tea pearls.For dessert, there is a new soya bean addition which mimics our morning/or supper porridge (yes we are now back to breakfast), quite filling but comforting at the same time. Their mango panna cotta served in an egg and topped off with a sweetened vinegar sauce is light, creamy and flavourful, while their Teh Tarik cr√®me brulee is the perfect icing on the cake. By now, you might have guessed that my wife and I were stuffed to the brim, extremely satisfied and scratching our heads to decide which dish we liked best. It was very hard to compare as they all tasted so different and each had its own unique characteristic and element of surprise.Labyrinth also serves wine pairing with this new Experience Menu and you only have to top up $60 (before taxes) for 7 different kinds of wine (champagne, white and red). I personally think the wines here are highly underrated, and their table wines (based on what I have tasted so far) are of premium quality. We also had a taste of their new tom yum cocktail that is a must-try for tom yum fans.In short Chef Han‚Äôs new menu has exceeded all my expectations as an ardent Labyrinth fan, and I think his dishes appeal more and more to Singaporeans, challenging us to look at our local dishes in new and refreshing ways. Kudos to mod-sin cuisine
5
Beautiful food. We took advantage of an excellent lunch special and were treated so well by the staff. The restaurant is moving from china town to the bay area which will be great as the space is very small. A must try
5
Wow. I read about this chef, about how many cooks do Singapore staple dishes but not many play with them. Here you'll find whimsy and skill, fun and complexity, taste and design. You will gaze, you will wonder, you will smell, touch and taste. No matter what culinary tricks are employed, you will savour the dish. Set menus mean a fun night of comparing notes with fellow diners. Something really special and a true treat for the senses. The tuna tartare that is actually water melon to start, then the peanut butter ice cream chocolate cigar to finish with elderflower water in a brandy balloon. So much fun, so much in between, go find out for yourselves
5
If one wants local food with a twist, then I would certainly recommend this place. It is like Wild Rocket but pushes the box more in terms of re-interpretations of local food (as opposed to food with local flavor). It is so creative that one should always go and try once for the experience. This place only has set menu so whether you like the local dishes, chances are you are going to have the food. But the interpretations are so different, the relation to the local food may not be liner. Going to a local hawker centre is nice because its like a buffet - you can choose what you want and things are so varied. So is the experience at Labyrinth except that because portions are small, one becomes very full but not belly-popping full. The dishes are so creative - there was one that looked like sashimi but it was actually a medley of melons with basil cream as wasabi. My favorite dish was the laksa which had a wonderful chilled oyster, laksa powder and coconut noodles. Everyone talks about the chili crab which is soft shell crab with a "chili ice cream" which suited me fine because I haven't really liked the chili gravy normally so I can choose the amount I wanted. They seem to use nitrogen or refrigerate the sauce so that seems to be the "style".

Labyrinth is located on the first floor of a row of shophouses along Neil Road. It has an open kitchen concept and most of the seats are "bar seats" around the open kitchen, though there are a couple of tables away from the open kitchen.The food served is modern Singaporean cuisine and there are essentially two menus, the Signature menu (6 courses for $108++) and the Heritage menu (8 courses for $148++). About half of the dishes are common dishes across the two menus, but the other half are different. My girlfriend and I decided to both go for the Heritage menu, with the chef allowing us to change several of the dishes to dishes from the Signature menu (so we could try more of what was on offer).We really enjoyed our dinner, which was delicious . It's quite an experience especially for Singaporeans as the dishes took innovative spins on local classics like Laksa, Satay. For example, one of the deserts called "Local Breakfast" looked like traditional Singapore soft boiled eggs (which was in fact mango puree with panna cotta) with black sauce (which turned out to be sweet balsamic sauce).Service was also very attentive and it was a pleasure to watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. Overall a really good dinner, though a tad pricey. The standout dishes for me were the Labyrinth Chilli Crab (which is actually soft shell crab with chilli crab ice cream), the Siew Yoke Fan and the Pineapple Fried Rice
5
We tried Labyrinth after looking at the rave reviews on Tripadvisor and am absolutely delighted to have done so.Despite the small venue, the service, food (we had the Heritage menu) and dining atmosphere was top notch, and this place is truly one of the best restaurants to dine in in Singapore. And we especially enjoyed the satay steak and laksa and not forgetting the Singapore "soft boiled eggs" breakfast that was served for dessert!Will be back again, and very excited to know they will be moving to a bigger venue at Esplanade. Will be watching this space for more yummy food
5
The staff were very welcoming and all of the food tasted amazing! The fish and chip and squid starters were both very clever and tasty as were the barramundi and wagyu beef burger mains. The apple crumble desert and the amuse bouche topped things off nicely and, in my opinion, this is pushing towards Michelin star food for a fraction of the cost, we'd definitely go back
3
The meal didn't work for me. The satay burger tasted weird and the sambal fish with kang kong tasted ordinary if you had gone to the order the dish at hawker centre I dare say it will taste better. watermelon dish was refreshing and apple crumble was delicious
5
I had the pleasure to visit Labyrinth last week during a visit in Singapore. An amazing welcome by the staff. The food is both a joy for the eye and for the palate. Great creations bringing old well known regional dishes from around the world together with modern ways of deconstructing and presenting the dishes in fabulous unexpected ways. Eating at Labyrinth is an experience, less other places in the world can top. I'm looking forward to the next time in Labyrinths new location

This restaurant is located at a row of shophouses along Neil Road.They serve Modern Singapore cuisine, and they have just added lunch service in addition to dinner, so you need not wait till dusk to enjoy a meal here. The restaurant is open concept, with the kitchen taking the pride of place behind the counter, where customers can sit and watch the chefs at work. There are several regular tables where you can sit down and dine with your dining companion face to face. The restaurant has a covered air well that allows natural light into the restaurant.I popped by with a friend for lunch, and we opted to sit at the counter seats. Here are the highlights:Amuse Bouche: Watermelon Ball with Mint. Served on a Chinese soup spoon, I popped the ball into my mouth and bit it. The outside shell is a thin gelatin shell and it popped to release the watermelon juice within. The mint leaf added a nice touch.Starter- Fish & Chips Soup: This is an interesting interpretation of Fish and Chips. This had a pea soup Espuma, with flakes of deep fried John Dory Fish and topped with crispy leftover crumbs. Mix everything up and pop into your mouth. Its unique and nice. - Lemon Squid Cutlet: Crispy squid cutlet served with honey-lemon dressing and fresh mesclun salad. The squid is chopped up and marinated with sauce, formed into a patty, coated with bread crumbs and deep dried. The honey lemon dressing is nice and goes well with the cutlet.Mains- Satay Beef Burger: A modern interpretation of the Satay. This had a Satay-spiced Wagyu beef patty with rice ketupat (traditional Malay rice cake) ‚Äòbuns‚Äô, home-pickled cucumber slice and two fried onion rings with fine peanut sauce. The beef patty is tasty and had the right satay spice infusion. The whole dish comes together well and I truly enjoyed it. Must-try!- Sambal Barramundi and Kangkong: This is a highlight of my meal. Fresh Barramundi fillet simply grilled and lathered with sambal chilli, much similar to BBQ Seafood style that you find at hawker centres. It‚Äôs topped with crispy kang kong, which had been dehydrated through a special process and sambal powder sprinkled over it. Dessert- Apple Crumble: Served in a martini glass with a white chocolate crumble, topped with yoghurt ice cream, apple jelly and an apple crisp. The crumble was unique, cos its dark brown. I learnt that they deliberately burnt the crumble to create this. Great taste and this is definitely a good llaollao alternative. Nice presentation! Its good!The 4 course meal was $45++, which included the 2 starters. If you choose only 1 starter, i.e. 3 course meal. you only pay $35++.This is a good restaurant to try out Singaporean dishes re-interpreted into a modern way and cooked with different techniques.As the restaurant has both counter seating and normal table seating, do make reservations so you are not disappointed.Recommended

Eating at Labyrinth was the perfect way to end a few straight days of eating in Singapore. The dishes were inventive and playful takes on the hawker and local fare which I had just learned about and I enjoyed the explanations of each dish. The atmosphere is inviting (I love bar style open kitchen seating so this works for me) and I look forward to visiting Chef Han's new location on my next visit.
3
I went for a friend's birthday dinner; prefix menu only, was about $220 per person including drinks. Gastronomic dining is always a risk and in this instance I didn't think it was worth the money.
4
Overall it was a good experience. Service was great and they have interesting food concepts.There were some food that I liked while some were just "meh". Personally my favourite was the chilli crab.What I did not like were1) Seatings arrangements. It was very close to the open kitchen which killed the ambiance a little because it was hot.2) Not really into the idea of the open kitchen. (saw this young chef with glasses wiped the radish on his hand towel before putting it on the plate.)Overall I give it 4/5 for,1) Good service 2) Innovative menu
4
Had a great experience coming here with a few friends. Service is excellent, chef is very creative, spinning variations of local Singaporean dishes. The food is witty and unexpected. But I suspect, you have to either have lived in Singapore a while to experience the nostalgia related to the food, e.g. laksa, breakfast, kaya with egg. Surprises abound.However, suggest that they get a bigger place, because this is not the venue you'll bring your clients as the place is cramped, and it doesn't do the food justice. Although I think that this place appeals to certain sort of people. You will be full after the meal. However, the portions are positioned in such a way, that the food doesn't feel substantial. Some guests may want to see their fish. Instead of it being disguised in certain way.I absolutely loved the genius of the watermelon disguised as tuna sashimi. Shall not reveal too many surprises. But the genius is not just the raw materials, but the taste combination, which works well for me. I hope he stays profitable, because this whole meal looks time consuming to execute

Had a Japanese friend visiting Singapore and is very familiar with the Singapore local cuisine as he previously resided in Singapore for a number of years. I take the opportunity to introduce him to a modern take on familiar Singapore dishes and brought him to Labyrinth. We had the Heritage menu and he was very impressed with the innovative twists on the dishes served by the chef and commented that not only was the taste surprisingly wonderful , the presentation was very artistic and a feast for the eyes as well and told me it was fun to watch the expressions of the other fellow diners when the dishes were presented to them.This seems to be a familiar refrain from guests which initially was sceptic that any further wows can be achieved from their already familiar favourite Singapore dishes such as the Chilli Crab or Siew Yoke Fan before they dined at the Labyrinth. Certainly hope that this modern take on Singapore cuisine will lift the standing of Singaporean dishes on the international culinary scene
5
The food is out of this world. What you see is never what you really get - just better! It's so innovative and delicious I'm certain you would come out feeling the same way. I especially enjoyed the squid ink paella and the signature chilli crab ice-cream. From what I hear, they are looking to have seasonal menus while maintaining their own signature menu throughout. In case you'd like to go back for more, and see what else this talented chef has to offer. Chef LG is really friendly too, and definitely knows his stuff. Top-class and affordable for the type of food you're getting. 5 stars for sure :
5
I brought down a couple of business colleagues down given it was their first time in Singapore and we were wearing suits so going to a hawker centre (I really wanted to though!) wasn't an option.My colleagues were nothing short of awe even though the restaurants set up was quite simple and bare to be honest. They were impressed with most of the dishes which had a an accompanied story behind the creations of the dish. Our server was attentive and engaged us with some pretty entertaining stories. Overall highly recommended for a very very different eating experience
2
Sorry hate to have to write this. We were really looking forward to Labyrinth. When a restaurant charges a lot for a meal, it is inevitable to face some level of scrutiny about what you present. We were greeted by the smell of oil which stunk up our clothes. chili crab was average. if you want the real chili sauce, other seafood restaurants do a way better job. pineapple rice was again sounded impressive but failed to deliver with seasonings that seemed extra. satay ribeye again was ok. a good steak should just be served plain and let the meat shine. perhaps the chengdol was the only saving grace
4
This is a #throwback review from last year, where I had the pleasure of dining over the bar counter, watching the culinary team prepare each dish meticulously before it ends up on our plates.I had such a ball of a time throughout the five courses in the degustation set. Every course had a cheeky touch yet without being frivolous, and I really appreciate Chef Han and his zealous team taking the effort to explain the inspiration behind each dish.Each dish was creatively presented here. Take for example, the first course - Tomato "steak" tartar - a vegetarian version made up of sweet, piquant tomatoes and topped with a mango "yolk". This shatters all preconceived notions of how a tartar should taste like, and is perfect for those who do not fancy raw meat. My favourite dish here - the Singapore Chilli Crab - is a deconstructed version composed of a deep-fried soft shell crab, chilli crab ice cream (tasted just like the real thing in a chilled, compact, and less messy form), and other fun elements like crumbled mantou "sand".The chendol xiao long bao was both a treat for the eyes and taste buds. Presented the way you would for xiao long baos, the thin emerald parcels filled with coconut orbs arrived in a dim sum basket, accompanied with a small porcelain jug cheekily inscribed with the word "vinegar" - surprise! it's actually gula melaka.As I write this, I'm reminded of how my next visit has been long overdue. Time to return for yet another exciting adventure

We had never tried a full blown Molecular Gastronomy menu before and we were not disappointed. I think this is a truly inspired menu taking everyday foods we all love and presenting them in such a beautiful way, and then the taste - WOW. Outstanding dish for me was the chicken rice, but there was not a thing served we didn't love. We will be back...............

Decided to pop in here with a foreign guest as he was going to have full blown local in the next few days. So I thought I'd humour him with some fusion They have 2 set dinner menus and we chose the shorter one. Starter of deconstructed pineapple rice was good but had no pineapple rice feeling about itThen there was a clever chee chiong fun interpretation where squid was used instead of flour. But I'm not sure most foreigners know what chee chiong fun isMain of beef seemed off, not sure if they used a good cut of beef. The satay sauce provided the local touch Dessert of chocolate stick made to look like a cigar plus an earl grey tea drink on a whiskey glass was cute, but not sure where the fusion isOverall good, but not brilliant. Also not sure if some foreigners understand the play on some of the local foo

Been there a couple of times and chef lg never disappoints! Love the food, presentation, ambience- restaurant labyrinth has brought mod-sin cuisine to a brand new level!

WOW! What an absolutely amazing surprise. This place is a real find for serious foodies as well as travellers who are keen to try Singaporean flavours with a unique, fun twist.Chef LG is an absolute gun. He pushes boundaries with food that I've not seen in a very long time. His and the team's eye for detail when it comes to the presentation of each dish, is to be commended. I am surprised to read of others' poor experiences! It hardly seems believable following my encounter. The chef came out and spoke with us which really personalised the experience. Just from this conversation alone, his passion for producing great dishes was evident. More importantly, the taste of each dish and the combination of flavours took me on a real journey. His take on chilli crab was amazing! We were even given a special treat of sampling some of his new creations without any charge! What a real treat??!!The price is at the higher end but for what it is, it is incredibly reasonable. Restaurants are charging almost double these prices in Australia. You don't want to miss out on this experience. I had never heard of Labyrinth and happened to stumble across it upon doing a Google search. If you have done the same, trust me and go. You don't want to end up being one of those people who says 'I should have gone'. Chef LG is a talent to be watched closely

I have been to the restaurants on numerous occasions and always leave feeling awed, extremely satisfied and looking forward to my next visit!What Chef Han and his team prepares on the plate is painstakingly designed, prepared and executed. This is a modern exciting and bold concept of fine dining, not your typical traditional banquet fare and not at exorbitant prices. It is uniquely Singaporean if I may say so and adds a modern twist to local fare.My favorites are the chilli crab ice cream and curry rice; not forgetting the amazing foie gras log cake I had during Xmas time that still blows my mind every time I think of it.Being Singaporean makes me additionally proud that a contemporary of mine is making such a great impact on the local dining scene and reinventing the way we look at SG food.Try Labyrinth if u have not and make sure u visit their Savour booth as well

This restaurant was quite a treat. It is expensive by Singapore standards (you can great food nearly anywhere) but glad we went and also upgraded to the wine pairings.Each course was elegently doing, using some very creative cooking and molecular gastronomy techniques. The plates were works of art. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food, but he also saw we wanted to have fun, so went out of his way to interact with us and give us pointers on food, wine and even local nightlife.HIGHLY recommended - we will go back on our next tri

We had the 5 course degustation of which 2 dishes were outstanding, 1 very good and 2 ok. Service was very good the let down is the view as mainly bar seating that looks into the open kitchen and quite untidy (eg. Household dustbin and a large N2 bottle were our view for the night). The music could improve to try to help give the place a better vibe as a bit flat. That said they are trying and sure they will look to improve going forward (essential to survive in Singapore). Worth a visit.
5
We had a ten course degustation. But if you think you are going to gorge on food laden plates think agin. That said each dish was a gastronomic adventure. These dishes are like nothing you have tried before. There are only two tables - we sat at the bar and loved the intimacy with the staff and their techniques. If you are into dining experiences, you must go once. We loved it

We were really looking forward to Labyrinth, having read several reviews of the place, we thought someone had come up with a clever modern idea with local food. How disappointed we were...When a restaurant charges a lot for a meal, it is inevitable to face some level of scrutiny about what you present.Upon stepping foot in the restaurant, we are welcomed by a very strong waft of a stale, oily smell. At first, the smell wasn't so nagging but as the evening wore on, the smell really stuck to our entire body, clothes and even worse - destroyed the general ambience of the evening.Not much to say about service, our waiter was friendly but I expected more care and concern for the cost of the meal.As for the food, Singapore is my second home so I know what local Singaporean food should taste of and I know what good food and clever cooking should taste of.We had a mixture of the signature and the degustation menus across the table so we could all try a bit of everything.The pineapple fried rice although sounded and looked impressive didn't actually taste like pineapple fried rice. The coriander sponge, apart from aesthetics added no flavour or purpose to the dish. Sense challenging as it might be, didn't actually fulfil my taste buds!Following this, the chilli crab and squid ink paella was clever and fresh but still lacked the punch in flavour that makes you want to go back for more.Finally, one dish that had the right flavour - the siew yoke fan. The pork was crispy and rice full of flavour. So far 1 out of 4.Apart from the cooking of the wagyu beef (you can't get this wrong really), the satay beef was a forgettable dish.The final savoury dish - Hainanese chicken curry although well presented again fell short in flavour.Now onto desserts...At this point, we weren't expecting much considering the mains had fell very short of expectations and the smell of the restaurant was really taking over but surprisingly, we were presented with a chendol xiao long bao which was delightful, light and refreshing, not too sweet and the chef could FINALLy consider this dish worthy of being clever with a twist.The other two desserts - reese's chocolate and Singapore breakfast were both above average, a little gimmicky, a little fun and were the reason why it was given 2 and not 1 out of 5 ratings.When visiting restaurants, most people's automatic reaction is to consider whether the food, ambience, service, etc is genuinely good value for your money's worth. And was Labyrinth worth my money? Absolutely not

Lorraine and I arrived into Singapore after 22 hours -- tired and weary. However we headed uptown and we are so glad we picked Labyrinth to dine in. We opted for the signature menu. After an aperitif we had a mouth tingling elderflower "snow" appetiser. Then the culinary delights started to hit us one after another. Difficult to single out any one dish as they were all top drawer. However I would mention the chilli crab sorbet (yes really), the beef with satay base and the chocolate cigar with accompanying Earl Grey tea served cold with elderflower "ice cube" looking like a cognac. The staff were very chatty but not too much ... Just a perfect evening. Do not miss this opportunity if you get the chance.

We went to this restaurant in Jan 2015 for our wedding anniversary. It was really wonderful. The service was excellent, attentive and the waiter took time to really explain each dish - this was needed due to the complexity of the dishes. The food is highly creative with many de-constructed dishes - i especially liked the pineapple rice and the chocolate cigar desert. I would strongly recommend as a dining experience - as the restaurant is small, probably better for smaller rather than larger groups - one of the best places we have been in Singapore
5
We dined here on a Friday night, sat at the bar and watched the chefs at work. From the moment we walked in we felt welcome and at ease. The food was amazing, style is like Fat Duck, a pleasant challenge for all the senses. Classic Singaporean dishes given an overhaul but still honouring their roots.So far it's our best meal in Singapore, and it will take some topping

We found Restaurant Labyrinth purely by chance and decided to eat there. Both the style of decor and the athmosphere as we entered assured us we were in for a treat, and we were not disappointed. The restaurant had been closed for a week and we went on their first night open so the menu was not the usual a la carte, but a 6 course set menu. We decided to have it although it meant spending more on dinner than we had intended. $108 per head.A spontaneous choice of where to eat turned into one of the best meals we have ever eaten ANYWHERE!!!!!The food is immaculately presented with flair and panache, tho the portions at first appeared to be minuscule, the explosion of tastes and flavours soon dismissed any concerns. As the dishes were served, both the matre d and his colleagues explained what was on the dish and how to eat it! Trust them. They know their stuff and it all added to and enhanced the experience. I should mention that I am not a fan of seafood, and chef Han quickly altered the order of the set menu to accommodate me which I greatly appreciated. When we finished our meal we were more than "sated" Every dish was just enough in quantity, and in fact to have any more would have spoilt what was to follow. As I said presentation and theatre was everything here, but it was still pure fun to be presented with a glass ashtray with a cigar in it complete with cigar ash as pudding which turned out to be a chocolate shell containing a mousse, while the "ash" was ground up roasted peanut ash. This was served with a glass of "brandy" which was actually a glass of cold Earl Grey tea with an ice cube infused with elderflower. Absolutely devine. Photos are attached

Was back at Labyrinth to try out their Festive Menu. Really enjoyed all the dishes served, especially the turkey version of their hainanese curry rice. Excellent execution as usual, and the christmas tunes in the air brought back good memories of the early 2000s.My friends had the Degustation menu, which has been updated since my last visit. The wagyu beef was cooked to medium rare perfection and some of them even proclaimed its the best steak they've had in a long time

Reply thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Labyrinth tonight. The food is a very cool re-interpretation of Singaporean classics like Pineapple Rice, Chili Crab and Hainanese Curry Rice. Most of the dishes were really well executed, the only let-down was a chewy wagyu beef piece in their satay and a slightly overcooked shrimp in their Cheong Fun version. All in all, for the price point you will get a great food experience and some refreshingly creative dishes
4
Decided to try Restaurant Labyrinth for its unique take on local food. As I went with my partner, I had the chance to try dishes from both the Signature and Degustation menu. Each menu has its hits and misses. For example, I think the 'Cantonese Porridge Carbonara' wasn't fantastic and hopefully it will be off the menu when the restaurant revises the menu. The must-haves are:- Siew Yoke Fan- Labyrinth Chilli CrabAnother thing to rave is the bread and condiments served before the meal

A small street hosting an even smaller restaurant where you eat at the counter like in an old american drugstore, although with a smart decoration and excellent jazz. The cook is Chinese and something like a former bank executive with a passion for cooking. 2 menus to chose from, both very creative while respecting the DNA of Asian dishes. Not cheap but worth the money and the detour. Pour les francophones, Olivier, conseiller du restaurant a roul√© sa bosse √† New York, au Japon et ailleurs et vous expliquera les arcanes de cette cuisine fusion

Came here for my 40th birthday dinner, and had really high hopes. Rave reviews all round on TA. However I could only characterise the food as average.We went for the full degustation. Certainly effort went into some of the dishes, but because the kitchen is 'bar style' with us sitting looking at them, it became clear how many things came out of snaplock bags. I'm sure they had been made fresh recently, but it just didn't give a great impression. I'd forgive that if the food was flavoursome, but with a couple of exceptions it was quite plain indeed.The highlight was probably the dessert where they remove the contents of an egg and put your dessert inside (a creme brulee type affair). That was very well done

We had dinner at Labyrinth on our last night in Singapore. Menu was exciting and it was fun to watch the staff preparing the meals. The restaurant is small and it was a bit difficult to find there. I loved the atmosphere and the service was excellent. Totally recommend
5
This was the place we were hoping to find while we were in Singapore. Singapore has a bunch of top fancy restaurants, but most of them seems to be the tradiotional fine dining with french inspired cooking. Labyrinth provides something else, by taking inspiration from local dishes and mixing them up and presenting them in a very creative way.The place is small with dim lighting and you sit at a bar looking straight at the chefs cooking. They have two set menus, one slightly expensiver than the other. Seven very different interesting dishes, all presented in a very unique and creative manner. The food didn't just look good, but also tasted wonderful. There was maybe one or two we didn't find that interesting - mainly the starters - but it just got better and better as we moved to main courses and the desserts.Skip the ridiculous expensive Michelin-restaurants in Singapore and go to this place instead if you are up for an unique dining experience
5
This is the best restaurant I have ever been to - and that includes a whole range of michelin star places around the world. Every dish is a work of sheer genius - beautiful, delicious, and oh so clever. Also superb value considering the incredible quality of the experience. service also fantastic
4
We had a great meal here, some wonderful surprises in the menu. We had the signature menu and it was well worth the $98. Experimental but not too crazy. Had a really fun and interesting night. Favourite was the Siew Yoke Fan (roasted pork belly risotto ramen), and the Reese's chocolate cigar at the end was a very satisfying end to the evening. Service was super. Recommend
5
Fabulous food - clever, creative and very tasty. The pineapple fried rice and the chilli crab are especially good. Great to watch the chefs at work carefully preparing each dish. Nice pleasant atmosphere and excellent service. Highly recommended.

Great place to bring overseas guests who are not first timers to Singapore. Food is local twist. Interesting take back for those who have tried local delicacies like chili crab, satay etc.
5
This restaurant is extraordinary. Two degustation menus about 98 and 128 SIN$. This is the only inconvenient, but it is not extremely expensive when compared with other similar restaurants in the nearby. -Dishes are original, of high quality food and extraordinary well elaborated and presentated. -Staff are really kind. -You can eat on the bar and in tables. -Wine is expensive. -it is located in Chinatown. In a street where there is nothing special unless the restaurant itself. Very recommendable!!!
5
Was back here for dinner again, this time round with some colleagues. We had a mix of both the Signature and Degustation menu amongst the 3 of us.Food was excellent as usual, especially loved the satay steak as it was so flavourful and the satay sauce perfectly complemented the flavours of the tenderloin. The new wine selection made us spoilt for choices and we had one of the premium reds in the end.Will definitely be back again, and wish that they open for lunch so I can bring clients over for corporate lunches.
5
Take a seat up at the bar so you can watch the chefs at work making your delicious dinner.They create Singapore's national dishes in a creative, beautiful and delicious way. The staff explain the dishes well (although it is a little odd to see the dishes whisked up the other end of the restaurant by the chefs then brought back down by the wait staff) and the degustations are good value for money.If you want to try Singapore's equivalent of Heston Blumenthal, book a spot

Came here with a business client for lunch, having read the encouraging reviews below. The set lunch is good value at SGD35 and we had a decent bottle of Sancerre for SGD75, however the service was a bit amateur and the food was over complicated and pretentious

Labyrinth opened just 4 months ago in Tanjong Pagar area, within a small Singaporean house, and is running smoothly. We managed to get a table last night finally; so you better book a table in a advance.First impression of the space: it is modern, cosy on the dark side, and one could be in Tokyo or NY, or indeed Singapore. There are only few tables and we preferred a seating at the counter which allowed us to watch the friendly young chef closely and discuss with him. You can feel his passion , his delicate serving way and great wish to see satisfied gourmets serving fusion combining ‚Äúwestern‚Äù & ‚Äúsingaporean‚Äù style in a playful and creative display, fooling the usual combinations with excellent taste. Service is very attentive.The signature menu 98$ (5 course pax) and degustation menu 138$ (8 course) are changing regularly in order to satisfy the pleasure of returning customers and is a must as everyone would want to discover more after the first pleasure.Pls note that I do not remember it all as i had myself only the short menu and had bites from the degustation menu... as we had a mix of both.The amuse bouche was a simple sweet surprising start crushed (but i would not start with anything sweet if directly followed by another sweet taste if i may suggest), followed by the focaccia bread with a garlic mousse, olive powder, balsamic jam (sweet); indeed unique & pretty good & fun, introducing the creative cooking experience.The mango tomato bruschtta is presented as a vegetarian tartare with a look fooling the ingredients, for a fresh and delicious experience. just loved it.*#1 this dish looked very like a beef tartare with the egg yoke even, and the taste was quite exquisite. The mango sphere sat on a vegetable green, amazing only to wonder how it was done, and added a fresh fruity taste to the tartare. it was a liquid & close to the silky egg yolk texture, accompanied by a tomato marshmallow*The coffee pork ribs was smooth and creamy as an italian expresso with it's playful pork biscuit (sweet and salty altogether).The chilli crab ice cream combined with deep-fried soft-shell crab was the first chilli crab that i ever liked in my life (i tried a few time before in other chilli crab restaurants in Singapore and ... hated it !!). The small crab was tasty, soft and accompanied with finest molecular cuisine. Un d√©lice !*#2 the chilli crab looked incredible, a piece of art, so pretty. & excellent flavors, superb dish the deep-fried soft-shell crab combined very well indeed with the chilli crab ice cream. they were arranged with the crab mousse, tofu, ikura, seaweed on mantou (È¶íÂ§¥) sand to give a picture of sea and tropical island).*There was a choice of mains ‚Äì black cod miso, roasted pork belly and satay beef tenderloin. The molecular black cod miso was up to the expectations in presentation and taste and large enough, a must have. The satay beef tenderloin with foie gras, perfectly cooked and delicious too.The Chendol (soup) dumpling with it's coconut milk ice shavings inside, was as fresh as green and refreshing.The ‚Äúdeconstructed‚Äù apple crumble dessert , surprisingly different & yet tasted like sophisticated crumble; *the stewed apple balls, apple crisp, baked white chocolates & yogurt ice cream all very tasty & combined well. An excellent dessert.*and some petit fours (which did not add anything to the yet so delicious menu above if i may say).*Tripadvisor is my lead for choosing hotels and restaurants but, as other readers might experiment, we have to be able to read through it and not be blind by marketing teams fooling the crowd funded information source that it is. Chefquak's recommendation (see other review below is a fully trustful source of information as i discovered last night. I allowed myself to use his comments and rework it to my taste. Thanks for sharing Chefquak!

I was at Labyrinth last week with a group of friends for dinner. Though its not my first time dining there, it was my maiden experience with the newly launched Degustation Menu. I especially enjoyed the black cod miso, satay beef tenderloin and pineapple fried "rice" due to the execllent combination of taste and textures. The fried rice is actually rice krispies and the dish does not look anything like the real deal, but in my opinion tastes so much better! The artisan pizza took the cake home and the dish looked and tasted like a summer garden on a pizza pan. Spinach leaves as the pizza crust - this takes thin crust pizza to a whole new level.One feedback I have is for the coffee pork ribs, which I thought could do with less salt. Loved the pork biscuit though (who makes such things??)The service was great, chefs were interesting to watch (we sat at the bar) and the ambience perfect for a relaxing and cosy get together with friends.Definitely gonna be back soon

a couple friends bought dinner @ labyrinth by han li guang at neil road on 30.4.2014. i knew of the restaurant the day before, started googling, and found the beautiful food photos in bibikgourmand.there was a reference made on willin low of wild rockets fame. i did like wild rockets & the laksa pesto pasta maybe 15 years back. personally i did not see any similarity just looking at bibikgourmand photos or having seen & tasted the food afterwards. :-) one was fusion in combining ‚Äúwestern‚Äù & ‚Äúsingaporean‚Äù ingredients and most importantly, making the result taste good & not for fusion sake (in that both were similar).in labyrinth‚Äôs case, it was going back to the ingredients, reassemble them into something that looked quite different (but very artisan & beautiful) and yet delivering the (excellent!) taste though perhaps not the overall experience eg the chilli crab ice cream combined with deep-fried soft-shell crab tasted like very good chilli crab but it‚Äôs not the same as eating a meaty crab, nor was it expected to be. the science of taste? molecular cuisine in its finest form? i am NOT qualified to say‚Ä¶amuse bouche? the lime sorbet was nice, simple, refreshing, nothing special.we were served focaccia bread with a garlic mousse, olive powder, balsamic jam. quite unique & pretty good & fun. could‚Äôt say this would match good freshly baked bread in a good restaurant, but they were good anyway & matched the food theme. balsamic jam was good, garlic mousse too, olive powder too refined for my taste buds..tasted nothing. #1 this dish looked very like a beef tartare with the egg yoke even, and the taste was quite exquisite. :-) the mango sphere sat on a roasted tomato, which was very tasty & great with the greens. the mango sphere was, to me, amazing only to wonder how it was done but did not add much taste nor texture. it was a thin liquid & did not have the silky egg yolk texture.#2 the chilli crab looked incredible, a piece of art, so pretty. & excellent flavours, superb dish the deep-fried soft-shell crab combined very well indeed with the chilli crab ice cream. they were arranged with the crab mousse, ikura, seaweed on mantou (È¶íÂ§¥) sand to give a picture of sea (and tropical island?). not sure if the mantou sand added anything, my palate not sophisticated enough to capture all the taste & texture, need more practice..haha. there was a choice of mains ‚Äì curry chicken or siew yoke fan.#3 the curry chicken was better than what i expected, though my wife did not like the dish so much. deep-fried chicken balls did not sound that great for main course, but these were quite tasty & you could taste the curry. the quinoa (‚Äúkin wah‚Äù) risotto was tasty too. i am beginning to like quinoa. my son‚Äôs friend made a good quinoa salad & my wife too so she was less impressed. as a ‚Äúdeconstructed‚Äù or ‚Äúreconstructed‚Äù or ‚Äúpigeon-holing not important‚Äù dish that was plated quite nicely, looked different & yet tasted like curry chicken, the dish was a great success. so it was good & exceeded my expectation but c/w with a good main (fish or meat) in good restaurant, it may or may not measure up after the initial excitement. also, like going back to the excellent chilli crab, it was indeed a ‚Äúwow‚Äù experience, very pleasantly surprised, but not the same as eating a meaty crab. so it‚Äôs a different kind of satisfaction & expectation.#4 the siew yoke fan was again superbly executed. the crackling belly pork was excellent, though our friends said the ones they had at basilico recently were even better. the risotto was very tasty, though i could not really tell if it was a ramen (tonkotsu?) stock.there were 2 desserts in the set ‚Äì chendol xiaolongbao & a deconstructed apple crumble.#5 the chendol xiaolongbao, with red beans, coconut milk ice shavings inside, had genuine chendol taste, was light & quite refreshing. it was pretty ok, i enjoyed it though it was not a favourite for me.#6 the apple crumble was very good. the stewed apple balls, apple crisp, baked white chocolates & yogurt ice cream all very tasty & combined well. an excellent dessert. the 5-course menu was S$78pax, a reasonable price for the quality of food & overall a very enjoyable fun experience. the food was very artisan (perhaps that would become an industry standard in due course), very creative (to me it felt totally new & had no peers in Singapore as yet). the other ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù place where the food presentation is very artisan is jaan (where i had the best degustation dinner on 20.1.2014 with the same couple friends), recently just got on to pelligrino world‚Äôs best 100, at 100th place. andre, iggy‚Äôs, les amis all very costly & i have yet to convince myself it is worth spending the money. it‚Äôs all about experience, very subjective, and also depends on expectations and perspectives, and perhaps very importantly on the the company too. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/05/02/incredible-artisan-fusion-molecular-cuisine-labyrinth-on-30apr2014

As I write his restaurants rating is 194 out of 7002 restaurants in Singapore. It deserves to be #1. This is the best food I have had in Singapore. there are many restaurants that charGe super high prices and I find the food to be just average. Labyrinth's food and the creativity, staff friendliness and service is simply outstanding
