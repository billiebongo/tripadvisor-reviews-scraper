There was a variety of Thai food to choose from and the dish I had was very tasty. They can also adjust the amount of spice/ chilly based on individual's taste bud needs.

Food did not taste good. There isn't really a lot of healthy selections since most things are fried.

decent variety on the menu, sumptiously satisfying

this is the best of the Golden Mile places to eat. Food is genuinely Thai and not a softened down version to cater to the non-Thai crowd. Prices are good and even with a bottle or two of Singha beer is unlikely to break the bank.
