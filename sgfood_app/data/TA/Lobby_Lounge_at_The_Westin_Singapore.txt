There was last Sunday, we had celebrated pre-x'mas gathering exchange gift with my big family's we hold at lobby lounge. We really enjoyed seafood high tea come with champagne package and perfect idea. The pianist was playing x'mas music was romantic and classic atmosphere. The brilliant part is the service never let you felt dissapointed at all even through the lounge seems looks very busy time. I would said choose right places with right attitude service made you felt pride ,enjoyable all the time. First time have reviewed because felt worth

Overall, this Seafood & Champagne Afternoon High Tea is value for money at SGD85++ for two persons inclusive of two glasses of champagne. However, I didn't quite like the "book before 11am" daily reservation condition imposed which makes it quite inconvenient.The poached prawn & creamed cheese and the lobster thermidor were the only 2 items that I enjoyed. The sashimi were not as fresh and the sauce was lacking.I was actually expecting a totally Western menu but it was half Asian and half Western. The dessert was just average, nothing spectacular.The view was also not pictureque as described but instead we saw a lot of construction. Service staff were also not prompt and did not have the Westin standard of the past

Nice decoration, nice staff, nice high tea. We have been there couple times and started to love there. We will go there again and again

Made a visit to this spot for some after-dinner drinks on a Saturday night and we were very happy with the choice. The lounge was quiet with a steady stream of guests throughout our stay. The night view we had, while not as spectacular and colorful like the one at Marina Bay, it was still a very nice view to have while you indulge in your drinks or food.Reservation can be made via either phone call or email, and it was smooth and simple process. Service at the lounge was also good, as you would expect from a Starwood hotel. We enjoyed the mojito and some fruit juices. The ambience was intimate, cozy and warm with the lights dimmed and soft piano music playing in the background. Great experience, and I would recommend this spot for some after work food or drinks

The ambience and settings were pleasant - spacious and excellent window views. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly with your request for extra water and nuts. Presentation and servings of the High tea were just right - leaving you ample time to mingle with your friends before they serve the next course. Though the servings seem small but you actually feel quite full after a good 2.5 hours of leisure high tea experience. As we had indeed via our reservations that it is for a birthday celebration, the staff came with a slice of birthday cake lighted at the end of our dessert.Credit goes to Tanya Zhu for providing us the wonderful experience. Will definitely return for another wonderful experience

I was there with my girlfriends to celebrate one of my girlfriend's birthday on this Wednesday (Ladies Nites). We were fascinated with the decor and we have seats at a quiet, cozy corner to ourselves (bcos we are noisy and we do not want to disturb others) Staff there, Candy n Yi Bin, were very friendly and attentive to our needs whenever we needed them. I will definitely go back there again if my friends n i needs a place to chill out

Must try their Seafood afternoon tea or champagne but make reservation in advance. The seafood is so fresh, especially the oysters. And would like to thanks the staff for serving us on such short notice, it make our trip to Singapore complete.

the variety of desserts was just so mouth watering, the salmon was fresh n it was pan fried on the spot for my colleague and i to indulge in, i ate so many salmons, the chocolates were also freshly made

Over our days we stayed at the Westin, we utilised the lounge a lot while waiting for friends and relaxing with a drink where I got 20% off as a SPG membe

Having drinks here at night fee so romantic because of the view - nothing beats having a whisky in air con comfort 32 floors above street level in a cosy intimate setting complete with good service and clean toilets!

Order a single malt and soak in the high ceiling and steering sights of the city plonked in very comfortable sofas. You can spend hours here.
5
The staff in the lobby lounge were fabulous and I was able to get a delicious and healthy smoothie for breakfast each morning. Love it!

The view is nice, but the service standard is below average, especially Tanya Zhu. She is rude and impatient. Drinks and foods are overpriced.
5
Sit near the windows for a good view of the port and the sea. Food was good and service was alright too.
5
Great appetizers and drinks - tried their Singapore Sling. We liked it better than the one we had at the Raffles.

Good lounge area with amazing view again, comfortable chairs etc. Great place for families and e.g. an informal business meeting. Quite warm though and seriously the single most expensive cup of cofee I've ever had. 12 dollars!

The lobby lounge has beautiful views of the city. It was cosy, and a hidden gem. A quiet and private respite from the crowds at the nearby restaurants and bars.

We called the Westin to make a reservation for their Sunday High Tea only a half hour before we arrived. After checking on availability, the front desk called us back within 5 minutes to confirm the reservation. We had never visited the hotel and did not know what to expect. When we arrived at the ground floor entrance, we saw what looked to be the lobby and a very simple looking cafe area that was completely empty. At that point we almost turned around and left. Thankfully we confirmed with the front desk and learned the lobby lounge was actually on level 32. Arriving on level 32, we were greeted by a huge and spacious lobby with grand views of the Tanjong Pagar freight terminals, Sentosa, the waters and islands beyond and new and existing office towers as well as a mountain of Verve Clicquot champagne bottles in a large display. Things just got a lot better! Although the space is large and grand, the seating is quite limited and arranged in such as way as to allow for a fair amount of privacy. We were seated next to a window with curtains that stretched all the way to the ceiling. We loved it. First came a glass of Verve Clicquot for each person, then the food which was elegantly divided into 3 servings, the first two with a seafood theme including Lobster Thermidor, fresh oysters and an Alaskan King Crab Tempura (our favorate) followed by cakes and chocolates. Our main critique was that a few of he savoury dishes could have used more seasoning which we fixed by ordering salt. Also what surprised us a little was that the set menu does not include tea, so we had to order this separately; moreover, each tea pot is meant for 1 person and served with only 1 cup. Our request for a second tea cup was graciously denied. If the Westin could add tea to the set for a small increment in price, that would seal the deal. Finally, all the staff we encountered were attentive and courteous
