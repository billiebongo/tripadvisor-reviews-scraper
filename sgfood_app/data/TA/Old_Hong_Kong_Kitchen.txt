Went there for CNY reunion dinner and opted to upgrade the menu. Despite the place being super crowded, and having to wait rather long as the previous sitting was running late, we enjoyed the food especially the roast duck.

Delicious and value for money set lunch, consisting of dim sum, soup, rice, various dishes. Able to choose from a good selection menu for each of the items. Minimum 2 persons.

Had a great evening. Services was good. Food was not bad. We loved the Peking Duck, white stewed Beehoon and the duck meat steam with bean curd skin. Interior decor was beautiful.

My family often comes here for dim sum, we find the food and service here pretty decent.So we decided to give it a try for this year’s reunion dinner with my extended family on Chinese New Year’s Eve. The dinner packages were quite over-priced for the kind of dishes served. Not that our food tasted very bad, but definitely did not warrant the high price we paid.The service was also rather poor that evening as there were long waits in between each dish and the restaurant looked very short on staff. Not just this, they also ran out of clean bowls and plates when we asked for a change! I had to walk around to look for clean ones myself and to bring them back to our table

Old Hong Kong Kitchen owners, have you eaten at your restaurant in Novena Square 2? Did you eat the dim sum? Did it live up to your expectations? When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, voted top 5 dim sum restaurants in Singapore, were you just messing with our heads? How did the rest of the food turn out so deeply unlovable? Does this make it sound as if everything at Old Hong Kong Kitchen is inedible? I didn’t say that, did I?The siew mai – forget it. The fried stuff were oil-soaked yet not very crispy. I don’t know how this place survives. I don’t care about the decor, I want my food. The prices were too expensive for what it was.This restaurant has probably the worst dim sum I have ever eaten in Singapore. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

~we were here for pilates and dropped in for an early snack~while it wasn't exactly opened yet a gentlemanly older man greeted me like his long lost acquaintance as you would and old villager returning home~the ambience welcoming, the cantonese-ness is unmistakable~my wife wasn't hungry so we only ordered a few dim sum dishes and they were as authentic as any you get in Hong Kon

Not great dim sum but service and comfy spacious dining makes up for what's lacking. Would be four stars if the dim sum is better but carrot cake is too soft andflavour is lacking. Glutinous rice is solo friendly since they serve it in small wraps instead of the usual large wraps that are for sharing. Shrimp cheong fun is pretty nice but the cheong fun isn't smooth and thin compared to the usual top dim sum restaurants. Century egg congee is pretty smooth but the ingredients are a little too sparse. Pork ribs are a tad on the salty side. Crystal dumplings are strangely with a carrot slice base which leaks the juice so you don't get to savour that for most unless you're skilled enough to flip it over before it leaks out. Nice place for a decent dining experience which is pretty rare and to have good service from the ladies there, I wouldn't mind visiting again

Went to Hong Kong Kitchen for lunch to celebrate Mother's Day. I had been to this restaurant on many occasions and must admit food and service remains good. Clean, nice ambience and fast. I ended ordering their set lunch as recommended by the restaurant manager since there were 4 of us. On hindsight, it was a good recommendation. There was dim-sum in cage, roast meat (siew yok/roast duck) soup, prawns, vegetables, tofu, steamed rice and chrysanthemum tea. I like the roast meat best, it's their specialty and recommended to any anyone to try it. Overall, a lovely lunch and inexpensive too

Went with my friend for lunch before our first scalp treatment experience (: we ordered their set lunch, which came with baked cheese rice, egg tarts, drinks, and we add on a steamed egg yolk custard bun. Both of us choose to have their milk tea (丝袜奶茶) per recommended (; we love the milk tea, egg tarts and the baked cheese rice. The steamed egg yolk custard bun was just okay, not really recommended. The milk tea could be tasted without sugar that would give you bitter taste and after added with some sugar, it tasted smooth and nice (: the baked cheese rice was superb, in which it's not too cheesy and with a bit of sweet and sour taste when you ate it with the tomatoes. The egg tarts was just nice! Soft and smooth but it's quite small though... would go there again because the customer service was excellent and even asked us to just rest and talk till whenever we like. probably it's not peak hour I Guess (

I rather like their pork buns in puff pastry, so I ventured there again today. I should have known better. The last time I was there the service was terrible, and my food was cold. This time the temperature was better, the pork buns were great and I was early so the service was only half indifferent rather than completely indifferent.Then I ordered my favourite desert - sesame rice balls in ginger. What a mistake. They were disgusting. Yes truly disgusting. Instead of a delicious soft outershell giving way to the burst of sesame it was a dry, but sticky half cooked starchy exterior. So bad I couldn't even eat one. After taking a while to get someone's attention, I sent it back. They weren't really interested in replacing it, so I just paid up and left. Except they charged me for the snack & towel I didn't order and didn't use, so that had to be taken off the bill - usually I wouldn't mind paying but this time I was really annoyed.Next time I'll just do the bun takeaway and not stay
5
Extremely good, compared to the other branches (that are really bad in food quality). Dim sum and noodles for lunch were great.
3
Service is not so good and food standard has dropped. Quite a disappointment considering it's pricey compared to the other food outlets around.
4
We enjoyed the food here and found it very reasonably priced for Singapore. The only issue was our eyes were too big for our stomachs as it's easy to get carried away by all the different dumpling choices!
3
This restaurant offers what I think is authentic chinese food. I know Singaporians are not into wine, but if you like a nice glass of wine with your meal don't bother coming here!
3
Pretty average food and low variety for dim sum. However, staff is friendly and service ia good. No rice item on dim sum menu. Location is behind sakae...a little hard to find.

As my in-laws were staying at the Oasia hotel in Novena, we popped across to Square 2 where we decided to try this restaurant with a great poster of his signature dish, the Peking duck.I must say we were not disappointed on any front. The Peking duck was superb - scrumptiously crispy and near fat-free skin - served with small, thin square egg pancakes. (Probably the best I've ever had â€“ and far better than the famous Peking Duck restaurant in Beijing!) We chose to have the duck meat cooked in noodles (ee mien). As it was a whole duck there was lots of meat and so the noodle dish was huge! We had to bring most of it home.The other dishes we had were: Hong Kong kailan (vegetable), salted egg crab (dry variety, very tasty); and crispy chicken served with sea salt. The wolf (goji) berry tea complemented the dishes very well. Service was friendly, helpful and efficient. Portions were ample.Price for our very enjoyable dinner? S$184. Really good value. No reservation recommending this!

Old Hong Kong is a Chinese restaurant located in Novena Square. The restaurant is a little 'squeezey' as there are too many tables and chairs packed inside.We had the dim sum and the Peking duck, which was very delicious. The food was carefully prepared and the presentation was very nice.Would definitely come back again for their dim sum
4
This is a wonderful mid-priced restaurant at the second level of a busy shopping centre adjoining Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is always packed at lunch time and often at dinner time. The dim sum, roast meats and set meals are excellent and recall those available in Hong Kong. The roast pork is a delight
1
Great food with terrible terrible service. We literally had to self serve every step of the way. I have nothing against service staff from China but they seemed to be against locals as they were prioritizing China guests to us and keep us on hold, ignoring us and pretending they didn't understand our request. The food is great but not great enough for such bad service and treatment

Had a celebration lunch at Old Hong Kong today and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dim sum. Apart from the cheong fun, everything was pipping hot and a lot less salty than it had tasted previously. Definitely value for money and some varieties of dim sum aren't found elsewhere! Way to go for an old favourite
5
Had a wonderful Sunday brunch at the place. Good value with free flow Verve Clicquot. Good assortment of sea food, foie gras and roasts. Nice and professional staff. Only negative, you have to pay for internet as a eating customer. But the view is breathtaking
4
Staff were helpful and curteous. Food was hot and delicious. The restaurant was lively and bustling. A good atmosphere for the lone traveller. Will be back.

Totally enjoyed the dim sum at this outlet in novena. They used to have one at east coast road but it wasn't as tasty.
The dim sum and zhi char taste good.
Will definitely return again, reasonable price too

The experience of dining at the Old Hong Kong Kitchen is akin to “dining in a garden”. The main dining hall of the revamped Chinese restaurant is surrounded by a modern Chinese garden and a glass pavilion. Its interiors elegant, with the extensive use of warm timber matched with maroon-brown chairs. The red feature walls framed with different Hong Kong artists photos. I like it so much. Food is always very good. We have her shark bone cartilage soup, veggi with crab meat… and must try is her dessert chilled Mango puree with sago served with ice cream

Old Hong Kong Kitchen is a must-visit place for those who love dim sum. Its mouth-watering selection of dim sum is one of the best you can find in town. High quality yet affordable, those are the main reasons people love about Old Hong Kong Kitchen.Old Hong Kong Kitchen is also where diners can find an awesome selection of Cantonese fare in an traditional interior. This is one of the best places in town to taste the goodness of the world’s most premium ingredients in Cantonese style like bird’s nest, shark fin, abalone and crab

Was there for the chinese new year "lohei" with customers. The roasted duck, bbq pork and roasted pork was very good. The deep fried prawn in wasabi mayo was delicious as well. Reasonably price for business lunches. Only negative was the staff strength, had to remind them a few times whenever we asked for things
4
This place was chosen because it was close to where we were staying and we were pretty tired after a busy morning of touring. Although we had no great expectations as to what we would eating we were pleasantly surprised by the varsity of menu items available and quality of what we ordered. Would return.
4
I wouldn't specifically seek out this restaurant but if you are staying nearby it's worth a visit. We had 2 lemon iced tea and 4 dishes to share. Pretty tasty, serving size a bit small for price. We were charged for 2 "snacks" - dishes of something that was put in front of us that we did not eat. Staff average but food good.
3
A good place to lunch when it's not crowded. The food is delicious, and there's a set lunch menu you can choose from, which is quite reasonable. One thing though, portion is quite small, though I don't feel hungry after my meal. Worth a visit nevertheless

This time, I would like to share my experience dining at Old Hong Kong Kitchen last March. I decided to go there and tried their food as the establishment looked quite convincing to me. I was there during lunch time and it was not really crowded when I reached there.As they named their restaurant as Old Hong Kong so I prepared myself not to expect too much for their service but I didn't mind as I went there for the food not for the service. I was seated immediately and they gave out the menu as well. I ordered wonton noodle soup which was certainly one of my favorite dishes as well as two different kinds of dimsum.They served out my wonton noodle first and the dimsum within few minutes apart. Both of them were delicious and I was quite impressed with the food quality they were preparing. However, their overall prices were in the higher side considering their location as well as the condition of the restaurant itself.Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to every one who is looking for quality meals during their visit in Novena's area in the future

I ordered a chicken dish in black bean sauce. The chicken came in bitesize pieces but almost every piece had gristle or bone in it. Maybe this is authentic Hong Kong food, but it's not what I expected or enjoy!
5
A short wait but well worth it.
Server was Mai who was delightful and said her sister is the owner. Food she chose for us was delicious and filling promised we would be back so I best make sure we do
4
Nice restaurant. The selection was adequate especially the DimSum. Though the staff couldn't understand us too well, they were patient and made every effort. The serving size was quite small or we were very hungry.
5
I forgot the chinese names but the Crispy Skin Pork along with the Char Siew Pork are worth coming back for. The Egg Custard Bun is also very delicious but be careful when eating it since the filling is really hot.

Came here for a business lunch planned for 14. We pre-ordered the chinese new year set menu. 4 extra people turned up and unfortunately the restaurant could not accomodate, which was a pityIt was a parade of rather bland food, and the service was rather slow. There was shark's fin, fish, glutinous rice, prawns and abalone. More misses than hitsThe surprise was when we had the yu sheng and the waitress gave a loud shout before we tossed. Hilariou
5
I was told that this restaurant serving very good set dinner. When I was there, the captain recommended me to try their MIX AND MATCH set. It sounds interesting. I chose whatever I wanted from the menu. Came out a good choice that suited my taste. I will visit again

Well heres the good news first.The bill was correct.Now for the bad: Be afraid,be very afraid,this place will make you lose confidence in Cantonese food and fair value for money1.Most of the staff seem not to be able to explain their own menu in English,so communication errors will occur.Not good, in what is an English- speaking country.2.No glasses of wine,only obscure and over priced bottles.Poor choice of non draught beers3.Most of the dishes,bar the duck appeared to actually be Cantonese!Strange indeed4.Elevator muzak.Enough said.5.Poor value and opaque pricing.We had crab which was priced per 100g.What they dont tell you is what the bill will be until you have eaten it!Enough said again.So when i did get the bill it was considerably more than expected,even taking into account all of the above.AVOID THIS PLAC

Tucked away at the back of the shopping centre along a narrow walkway. It is on level 2 in Square 2. The place was not busy when we were there, we were the only customer which was good. We took our time and chat over tea & our Timsum. We had their steam char Siew flour rolls, was a disappointment as the skin was thick. The steam chicken feet was average, had tried better ones in other Timsum restaurant. Steam shrimp & pork dumpling was not bad, very meaty, did not use too much pork fats. Their fried sticky rice dumpling was savory & it's one of their best item. Overall service was attentive. Price was average. Will not mind to patronize this place again if I'm in Novena are

Me and my girlfriend bought a cash voucher from groupon and went to this Hong Kong restaurant. We didn't have much expectation when we saw there're only a few customers in the restaurant. We order 5-6 types of dim sum including egg tart, buns, 烧卖, 虾饺, etc. Other than 虾饺 the dim sum there is quite delicious.  We spent around $60 there. A bit expensive, but if you are looking for delicious HK Dim sum in Singapore, you can come here and give it a try
1
The food is quite tasty. The prices are steep and the portions small. But the service is very very bad. The waitresses go around with a black faces. Today, tea which is usually served at the beginning was served after the tim sum arrived. Waitress was unhappy she had to explain about certain dishes and the best part they got out bill wrong 3 times - we were overcharged ! There are better tim sim restaurants around for sure
