1st time trying the coconut shreds dish and it was excellent as an appetizer (starter). In general, food quality was ok and there is not much crowd (at night) as well. Do visit if you are around the area.

It was below expectations. The ambiance was low key, casual style located inside the Novena Square Mall. It was more like a fast food/casual type Thai restaurant in a seated environment. The staff was friendly and welcoming, clean atmosphere. Looks authentic Thai, but the taste was nowhere near. The Green Papaya Salad was lacking any type of flavor. While the papaya was crunchy and fresh, but it is lacking depth. The Hot Pot Vermicelli Noodles with Crabs was just not what I expected. Very dry noodles, and not much flavor to it. The crabs was medium size and just didn't have the flavor I was expecting. Not worth the money that I paid for. Will not be coming back.

Had a very nice meal in this restaurant while on my travels in Singapore. It was full of locals, which is normally a great endorsement! I had a great yellow curry and really enjoyed the mango and sticky rice for pudding. Oh and make sure you get a cup of lemongrass hot tea
3
It was a little less than we expected - but then is was fast food style Thai in a seated environment. The service was fast, tables seemed to turn over within a few minutes and food came out quickly. The meal was average quality - more like the take-away chain pre-prepared style rather then cooked from fresh. If you are in a hurry and want Thai tasitng food - this will work, if you want a sit-down authentic Tahi meal it might not be quite what you are looking for

The ambience is simple and nice, the food is good and authentic. There is soo much to offer on the menu. The tom yum soup, green curry, red duck curry, signature steam fish, papaya salad & mango sticky rice was what we tried and it was delicious. Restaurant staff were friendly. Great experience ! Definitely will return for more.

Quiet literally the most appalling attempt at Thai food i have ever experienced!Low quality ingredients. Donâ€™t expect any duck in your duck curry. Clearly no one working here has ever been to Thailand!This place is clearly not intending to be around for very long judging by the obviously temporary fit out. Avoid
5
We found this place by chance, it was full. Food was amazing, my roast pork was so tender and tasty. My husband ordered the spicy, red chicken curry that was also divine. Food was served quickly and our mango and sticky rice was the perfect end to a lovely meal. My only complaint was the a/c, it was freezing in there
4
We reached the place at 8.30pm and it was bustling with full house crowd. Lucky to find two seats for ourselves. Despite the crowd, the service crew served all the food within 10 minutes. The taste of the food itself is not excellent for me, but I would say it is good. Food is a little pricy (tom yam soup is about $16.00). But serving portion is big. Overall, can try at least once.
5
It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant was full when we arrived. The person in charge was very helpful. He took down our contact and gave an estimated waiting time. But within a few minutes. He called and offered us a table. We had tonyam, red curry, vegetables, fried rice and the much recommended mango salad. We had a very satisfying meal and the price was just right. The waiter told us that there are some special dishes which were not on the menu. We will come back for more

My first visit to this restaurant though other family members have tried their food at the old premises in Funan Centre.The prawn crackers served before the meal comes with a great green chili dip. Pity they don't sell this dip. The lady (manager/owner?) who took our order graciously acceded to our request for the creamy tom-yam soup instead of the clear soup option in the menu. The signature lemongrass salad is not to be missed; eaten wrapped in the fresh lettuce leaf. Delicious!All dishes were served quickly and temperature hot. We loved the steam fish with spicy and sour soup. The fish was fresh and tender with generous soup sauce. Morning glory vegetable has a good crunch, not overcooked to a dull green.The meal ended with the Mango sticky rice. The glutinous rice was very good and warm. Only disappointment was the absence of roasted pine nuts on the rice. Attentive service throughout, hot drinks were served in the pretty traditional thai colouredporcelain mugs. Definitely coming back for another meal.

large menue selection, great food and taste experience, friendly and efficient service, good place to have 1h dinner, would not go for a longer evening...
5
Awesome Thai food~~ tried green curry, Tom yum seafood (clear) and Kai lan with oyster sauce. All are very nice. Looking forward to try other dishes next time.
5
Great food, delicious, good services and comfortable. I came here always for lunch whenever I'm in Singapore city. Highly recommended the steam fish sea bass.
3
Had a group lunch at this restaurant which serve Thai cuisine. This isn't an authentic Thai restaurant but serve simple Thai food. Food taste is very ordinary and nothing spectacular but service is pretty efficient.
4
Heard good things from Thai friend about A-roy so happy to finally try it. Had mango salad, stuffed chicken wings (one each) green curry pork and stir fried chicken; and a drink each. Came up to S$30 per person, which I feel a tad expensive, S$ 25 would have been just right.The food is reasonably good, but not fantastic. I won't bother with the green curry pork which is oily, and pork is chicken like. Chicken wings is fine, salad is fine for the taste although the looks are very unrefined, and stir fried chicken was ordinary.The ambience is more like a cafe that restaurant. Service is earnest but not restaurant standard.Overall an ok place for Thai food, but not destination dining
1
We saw a cockroach crawlng up a wall next to our table. Staff told me that it was due to fumigation which was carried out at night, No excuse for any restaurant. I will not be surpriised if more pests would be found if the NEA inspected the place, since the pest was visible even during the day.  I would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it to anyone. There are much better restaurants at Velocity with better quality food, and hygiene
4
I have difficulty finding authentic Thai restaurants in Singapore, aside from chains such as Thai ExpressThe dishes we tried including fish cakes & Tom Yam soup were mostly good, except the baked prawn with glass noodles The lemon grass salad is outstanding , & is a mustPrices are reasonable, & portions generousThe place is plain, but you don't go to such restaurants for the ambienceRecommended

My lunch mate and I dropped by at Aroi Thai with the aim of having a simple meal and a conversation. We were served quickly but did not manage to have a relaxed meal and our conversation. The square tables for two were stacked close together like in a food court and we had to be careful to avoid knocking elbows with diners seated at the two tables on our left and right. The place was stuffy and noisy like a neighbourhood coffee shop.We ordered green curry, hormok (steamed seafood custard), tod mun goong (shrimp cakes), stuffed baby crab shells and two plates of rice. We did not expect Aroi Thai Restaurant to serve fine Thai cuisine but we did expect the food quality to be better than Thai fast food that can be purchased from a food court just steps away from the restaurant on the same floor. All our dishes were served almost immediately after we had placed our orders indicating that the food was cooked in bulk instead of freshly prepared upon order. The tod mun goong had no taste of prawns/shrimps and were not completely drained of the oil that they had been deep fried in. The green curry was watery and had a layer of oil floating on top. It could do with more coconut milk and basil leaves. The stuffed crab cakes were tasty, filled with minced pork and bits of chopped carrot, but a tad greasy. The biggest disappointment was the 'hormok' which is supposed to be a steamed seafood custard. The version served at Aroi Thai was not in custard form but a mushy, ultra oily red curry with calamari and strips of coconut flesh (see photo).Service was deplorable. Dishes were briskly put in front of us. We had to ask for serving spoons. The only saving grace was being served tap water with ice upon request. Empty glasses were ignored and we had to ask twice before these were refilled even though the restaurant was not short of staff. A waitress cleared my plate even though my lunch mate had yet to finish her food and the we still had half a bowl of green curry on the table. A simple Thai lunch for two persons, without any drinks or dessert, in a neighbourhood mall outside the business district, set us back SGD64.00 (USD46.00) which is expensive even by Singapore's standards. Our visit was a disappointing experience. I am not inclined to visit this restaurant only as there are other places in the Novena/Newton/Thomson area serving good Thai food at more down to earth prices
4
A total of 10 had dinner and I must say its a wonderful dinning experience. Food is excellent from the starters to main dishes . The tung yam kung (clear) was just right the level of spicy. You can actually request the level of spiciness according to your liking. The seafood otah served in coconut is to die for. Price is also reasonable.
4
Been eating at this Thai place for ages since they were at East Coast road, then Funnan now Novena, Standards are very well maintained. Always have the same old dishes, which are Tom Yam Soup and Deep Fried Fish in sweet and sour sauce and its never disappoint
4
Nice place for Thai food at reasonable price. Don't forget the Pla Krapong Neung Ma Now and Ho Mok Maphrao Aon!!
Favourite
5
Couldn't find any other better Thai food. The Tom Yum Goong, Wing bean & lemon grass salad & steam fish are so delicious...
5
I live around this area so frequent this restaurant a lot. Everything on the menu is delicious! Some of the staff may not speak English, but ordering is easy as there are lots of pictures in the menu. Highly recommend the clear tom yum seafood sou
4
This is a very busy food place and you need to book early to avoid disappointment. Their prices are reasonable, menu is large, and the cooking good. Their Olive rice was fragrant with good texture. The Seafood Otak in a coconut was very tasty, flavourful, rich and creamy, cooked with coconut milk, hot and spicey. The Green chicken curry was very authentic and delicious! The Prawns with tung hoon dish was disappointing- the prawns were not fresh. The Papaya salad was refreshing and tasty. We ordered a local Thai green vegetable omelette which was finished quickly as it was tasty and had a nice texture. We will certainly return to try their other dishes which other tables had ordered and looked very good.
5
been going to A Roy Thai for over 20 years. its now in a new space at Novena. Food is still exceptional that even Thais can't beat. It also caters to Vegetarians so make sure you let them know and they will prepare most dishes especially for you. Don't skip on the salads and soup. The red and green curry is a must!! Plus a sip of their Thai Iced tea will make you feel you are right in Bangkok. As a tip call ahead and make reservations as they are so packed these days :)
1
Small portion of food at very high price, taste of food is below average. Super salty chicken, extremely oily vegetable, tasteless curry prawn etc. Other than took our orders and delivered the food to the table, no service was rendered. To make things worse, we felt incredibly thirsty after the meal. Can easily find better Thai food in hawker centres.
5
Went on the CNY Friday afternoon with colleagues - the place was packed... testament to how great their food & service is !! Wide variety of veggie dishes, signature lemongrass salad - one of a kind & sweet tender coconuts !! Among the BEST Thai food in SG..
4
A family gathering dinner chosen at A-Roy Thai Restaurant located on Level 3 at Velocity. Conveniently located with direct accessible from Novena MRT station.Clean aircon cosy restaurant with about 30+ sitting capacity. Friendly efficient service staff who are bi-lingual. Warm food served quickly despite restaurant about 90% filled. Crispy prawn crackers ($1 per basket) dipped in green chilli was really great. Fish maw soup, fried kankong, thai fish cake, fried chicken and bean sprouts were all tastefully good too. A meal for 6 persons cost about $140.Reasonably priced. Enjoyed. Will visit again
4
All the dishes we ordered tasted either good or average, did not find the food that fantastic as some reviews had implied. Most of us only took one try of the lemongrass salad. I have tasted better steamed tapioca and mango sticky rice at other Thai restaurants. We ordered 7 dishes and 3 desserts for 6 people, cost about $30 for each person. Service was prompt and friendly, although maybe a bit too eager as we were approached a few times to take our order when we were not ready to do so as it was the first time at this restaurant for all except one of us
5
THE best Thai food in SG... and by miles !! Their Lemongrass Salad is mouth-watering.. Basil Tofu is delicious.. They can customise ANY dish and make it Vegetarian - which is a BIG WOW for us. The usual Pad Thai, Coconut Milk Soup & Sticky Rice w/Mango is also delectable. A regular now for us !
5
Our favourite Thai restaurant that serves excellent authentic Thai food. Our particular favourite is the Kai Lan with Beef - unbelievably fresh crunchy and delectable. Also the Pad Thai and desserts.
5
Very authentic dishes, even down to the much too sweet iced tea; and all the dishes are uncompromisingly "Thai level" spicy.
5
Went with a Friend - who could speak Thai.. and the food as well as the service was "out of the world"... Basil Tofu, Dry Red Curry Tofu with White Rice.... Delicious & left us wanting more !!
5
just went to have some Thai food! they are moving to viva city after june 2016! do try lemongrass salad (sweet)
4
the thai ice tea is very nice, my personal favourite in singapore. i love the lemongrass salad. the other dishes are not bad either.
we come here regularly as it is close to work.
5
With the closure of Funan Mall, A-roy has moved to Velocity. Still the same great Thai dishes that are authentic and not overly dressed up. The Tom Yum is just nice without being overpowered by chilli paste. Try the herb chicken wings deep fried with basil and lemongrass.
4
One of our favorite lunch places in the area as I work around there. Our colleagues and I sreedhan mildly addicted to the food in A-Roy Thai and will visit at least 1 every fortnight. It is always Phad Thai and Phad si yew for us.. but it is also a good place for team meetings too.. where you can order dishes and rice to share. Their specialty dish Lemongrass salad is a must-try.. awesome basil chicken, tomyam etc.. had a couple of average dishes but it's so insignificant I don't remember them. Ahh possibly steam fish which they will always recommend but it's too fishy for my liking. Personal preference though cuz my friends loved it. In a nutshell, the food is better than average but it depends on what you order I guess. To be fair every restaurant have their specials and not-so. Look around and see what others have on their table or ask for the staffs recommendation. The people I see there are always regular. Sometimes the restaurant is booked as it is popular for team lunches. Staffs are friendly and service is quick. A little on the pricey side but it is always okay for a little indulgence. **moving to Novena in June as Funan is closing. Be sure check before going

I don't understand why this would be considered a good place for Thai food. It's outrageously overpriced for its tiny, tiny portions. I expected to be blown away by the quality or the taste of the food, at least. But it was severely underwhelming. It's S$11 for a small plate of beansprouts that was too salty, and the salted fish was old and tough. The $15 minced pork salad was watery, $15 lemongrass salad was dry and olive rice barely had olives and for a whopping S$8, small. Who charges $5 for a small mug of lemongrass drink? While the service was swift and homey, the temperature of the place was frigid. I understand how these things can be subjective but honestly, it wasn't good. I won't return

I've been fortunate enough to travel to Bangkok and Phuket in recent years and therefore enjoy some of the very best Thai food money can buy. It's a great shame that Thai food in Singapore pales in comparison. But A-Roy is pretty good. When you go to a restaurant in an IT mall, you know that you're not gonna get a lot of ambience. I reviewed Jim Thompson in TripAdvisor and that's a reasonable place if you want to take someone from out of town or even if you're on a date - for the dÃ©cor and ambience.But if you just want good food then A-Roy will serve you well. Apparently this restaurant was opened by four sisters about 30 years ago. Don't expect the most professional of service either. But I think it's a fairly good sign when you see so many Thai nationals in the restaurant - be they embassy staff or Buddhist monks.I thought their Pad Thai is great though it could do with being a tad less sweet in my view. I also love their wingbean salad. That's a dish that's hard to find in Singapore now in Thai restaurants though it's seasonal. Actually pretty much everything is excellent though oddly I was a bit disappointed by their Tom Yam Koong. I suppose everyone does it slightly differently but their version is not my favourite

This is one of our favourite Thai restaurants amongst my friends for several years. Today, we had the green mango salad, otah, fish cake, tom yam soup with seafood, basil chicken and mango sticky rice. The otah was unlike any I've eaten, served in a coconut and had a generous serving of seafood. It was lemak and goes perfectly with rice. The basil chicken was fragrant and always a favourite of mine. The mango sticky rice was terrific - mango was amazingly sweet. In general, we enjoyed all we ordered. The dishes are spicy so do ask them to moderate it if necessary. The bill came up to about $130 for 4 persons which isn't cheap, nor exorbitant. Complimentary wifi available. Free parking at Funan when dining there on weekday nights. They're moving to Velocity in May and their last day at Funan is Jun 30 this year

We had lunch there and we Love the food, the pad thai the tom yam !!
we took out another dish because it was good :D
4
Good service, lovely food.
I recommend their fried lemongrass / cashew nut dish , also their otah coconuts. Tom yum soup
Is super spicy & yummy
4
The restaurant offers variety of Thai Food. Taste of the food is ok but a bit pricy. If you really craving for Thai food, you can try once.
4
Went with a group of 4 friends. We had tom yam soup, papaya salad, fish, pandan leaves wrapped in chicken. It was very simple meal but it gives the homely feeling. highly recommended!
4
Great place for a meal, authentic Thai food, great quality, perfectly cooked and fast friendly service, reasonable prices, would highly recommend
5
It's super delicious! Mouthwatering green curry and yummy tomyum soup...
We r vegetarians n they have good options for us as well. And the main thing... Their veg down have any seafood smell also...
Wil go back again!!!
5
We ordered 3 dishes and rice between the 2 of us. A Thai mango salad, Thai Beef with Basil and Chicken and Lemongrass.The food was delicious and wonderfully spicy. We could not fault the service with the staff very attentive even though we were the last customers of the day and we did not feel hurried. As a matter of fact, they went to the effort of making a custom mango and coconut milk drink for my partner. Nothing was too much effort
3
Save your money...Was in Funan Shopping Centre hoping for something a step up from the food court. Overall:3/5...had the Tom Yum Soup, Mango Salad and some fish cakes.Asked for less spicy for all and it was way too spicy to eat. The overall presentation is slightly below average. The mango salad lacked flavors and the Tom Yum soup was seriously skimping on the prawns ($12 for 4 prawns in the soup). The fish cake had decent flavor, but was rubbery like a small frisbee. You could save your money and get same if not better at Thai Express or even a nearby food court..
3
In addition to the usual Thai dishes, they also have uncommon dishes (highly-recommended lemongrass salad, curry otah served in a coconut shell).The cooking is not the most refined, and some dishes lack flavour, but overall it's pretty respectable given the ambitious menu with nearly 100 items. Friendly, homey yet efficient service. Tired 70's décor. Prices are a bit high for what is essentially a family-style café , but still reasonable
4
The staff are always very friendly and helpful, and the menu selections are sufficiently varied to cater to most tastes.The Lemongrass salad is an amazing combination of flavours.The food portions are appropriately sized.I have regularly eaten here for over 10 years and would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to experience the flavours of Thailand
4
I came here for a work and working lunch. It was a delicious feast for the senses. The lemon grass tea was a great warmer after a frigid office and the lemongrass salad was spectacular. A real find
5
Authentic thai cuisine made in a very delicate and served in a very homely environment. The delicate touch in the dishes is a must eat to understand this cuisine. Loved it.
4
I am in love with their food. Yummy yummy food. The service is fast and good. It's a family restaurant. It's not really a sophisticated place but since I liked the food, I was happy.
3
Ordered a green curry with chicken dish for lunch and was disappointed to see that the portion didn't quite fit the price I was paying. For almost $16, the portion I was getting was similar to what I would've gotten elsewhere for half the price. Needless to say, it wasn't a very good start to the lunch (thank goodness I was hungry, right?).The food itself is alright, and tastes quite home-cooked. They interestingly added some sort of squash to the curry, which is the first time I've seen it
4
Run my Thai sisters who are always present at the restaurant, A-Roy has been a favourite for my family since 2005.The food is very authentic Thai and there are sufficient options for vegetarians like me. Service is quick and the place is run with a family-run atmosphere. Even my non-vegetarian friends love the place.Be careful when you order the food : make sure you tell the server how hot you would like the food to be. Forget to tell them and you could burn your tongue with the famous Thai chilli padi.A-Roy Thai uses lemongrass to great effect. I love the vegetarian Clear Tom Yam Soup. My favourites : Lemongrass Salad, Glass Noodle Salad, Deep Fried Beancurd with Sweet & Chilli Sauce, Kailan with Mushrooms, Olive Rice & Green Curry.The place is a tad noisy and could do with some fabric on the walls. Situated in Funan The IT Mall, it is very conveniently located.I frequent the place at least once a month
4
The A-Roy menu has all of the staples that you would expect in any thai restaurant, and they are, on the whole, well prepared and simply presented. Pad kra pow (minced meat with basil and chilli), whether chicken (as we had) or pork (as tasted in the past), is always deliciously smoky, peppery and a touch spicy. It could be spicier, and that would improve it, but this dish arguably appeals to a wider cross-section by not being lethally hot.Kailan with mushrooms and sea asparagus were also tasty, with oyster sauce bringing out the flavours in the vegetables, and offering a different taste sensation from the pad kra pow.The green curry chicken was also a decent rendition of this absolute staple, but again could be a touch more spicy. A-Roy isn't romantic, but it is authentic, which has a price. If you want cheaper thai food, there are other options, but they won't get close to A-Roy's authenticity, and that makes it worth that little bit extra in my book
2
From their manually printed menu, a photo showed grilled pork with chilli sauce served separately. We ordered 2 portions ($15.90 X 2). The actual dish was served with chilli sauce poured over the grilled pork. 2 of our family members can't take spicy. I asked the staff why the chilli was not separated and she said it has always been served this way, chilli poured over pork. I ordered another portion, this time chilli and pork to be separated. Now we had so much pork on our table, it became a chore to finish it. When the bill came, I was surprised to see that latest order of pork was a larger portion ($22.90) than normal and I had to pay more. So in all the grilled pork cost $54.70!After communicating with the restaurant people over this issue, my takeaway was that they were more right than customers and there was lack of flexibility. There was no apology if there had been any miscommunication. Quite disappointing
4
If you want authentic Thai food relatively cheaply in Singapore this is an excellent place to come. The must have is the lemongrass salad - it was so good I had to ask them for the receive. The Thai curries and steamed fish are also spot on. Service is straightforward and not fussy. The restaurant is in a shopping centre and is nothing fancy, but if you want good quality real Thai food then worth a visit

We dined at A-Roy Thai restaurant for dinner last week. The restaurant was about half packed and we were served promptly. The service was pretty alright. However, most of the dishes were way too pricey and I would warn you to be very selective of what you order. Here are some very pricey orders we had:3 tiny fishcakes for $13.80 (incl. 10% service charge + GST). Chicken wing for $5.80 a piece! (incl. 10% service charge + GST). We ordered 3 chicken wings for a total of $17.30 (Wow, this is really expensive).Also, a charge of $1.20 for the 'welcome' appetizer cracker was conveniently slipped into the overall bill. This is a turn off and it says a lot about the operators. I think restaurant operators should learn to 'leave the last dollar on the table'... (you don't have to earn every dollar!)Bottomline: Seriously Too Pricey For Average Tasting Thai Food. Avoid no matter how hungry you are! :
1
12 of us went to dine at A-Roy Thai Funan and we can't believe that we paid for $43.60 for a plate of Kangkong. We ordered large portion but they don't have it in the menu and they creatively combined 4 plates of medium size into 2 plates (2 medium into 1 plate). In my mind, the waitress should have advised that there is no large, maybe you can have 2 or 3 medium size and served them individually instead of combining them
4
I would say that this is actually a pretty good Thai restuarant in the middle of it center funan center. The basil minced pork is good and the tom yum pretty authentic. The fried egg with prawns very flavorful. What's to complain?
3
Half decent food, but definitely not worth the money. Portions are fairly small and the service was not particularly good. In a short sentence - go elsewhere!
2
From outside it looks nice, but inside the ambien was bad! Worse Thai food I ever tasted!
Can't recommend this place to anyone!

My family has been going to Aroy for a four years now. It is a nice family owned little restaurant in the heart of Singapore..funan digital mall. Always had fresh food here. The mango and sticky rice is perfect. The dishes we love are musaaman curry, the tom kha gai with shrimp...a bit spicy but delish. The lemongrass salad is a winner each time with its lettuce wrapping and delicate flavour. The service is great with the whole family feel, the ambience leaves a lot to be desired. The tube lights and plastic tables are a turn off. Considering thd pricing the ambience is a let down. But the food is always fresh and we have always come back happy in the tummy.
1
let's start with starters. 4 Pandan Leaf chickens which are smaller than your fist. Price S$13.90.4 flat fishcakes. Price S$15.60. Also smaller than your fist.a mango salad dish S$12.902 juices (not fresh jiuce) S$9.80The vermicelli with prawns (really small serving) - S$16.90I don't want to talk about the crackers and GST and Service Charge.Total bill S$83.65 for the 2 of us. Bottom line - I won't be back. EVER
3
This was our second Thai dining experience in two days, the other being at a Tampines HDB neighbourhood.Aroy Thai still does some dishes well, especially the fried fish in the sweet and sour sauce. The pad thai was good, but was a little too sweet for my taste. The green curry and minced pork with basil were delicious.Though I still prefer the original eatery in Siglap, this is a good alternative closer to town. Prices seem to be higher than what I remembered a year ago, but that can be true of most restaurants nowadays. Taste is still authentic Thai, and we will be back
5
I don't think I'm overstating the case, but now that I've said it, that worm of doubt buried deep in my midbrain is beginning to squirm, making me second guess myself. Now that I've said it, I wonder if I'm not going to have to eat my words when some lonely food nerd invites me to venture into some hitherto unknown to me neighborhood, pointing me to a hole in the wall where I witness the second coming in a simple bowl of awesomeness and I then have to feel like a total fraud every time I read this review on Yelp. While I can't really control what that midbrain worm does, I can certainly man up and have an opinion, so yes, I'll stick with A-Roy Thai simply being the best Thai restaurant in Singapore.There's safety in numbers and you realize why when you sit down and order the lemongrass salad that so many other Yelpers have been raving about. Only those kooky Thais could have figured out that when you slice lemongrass thinly, pass it through oil in a hot wok, you get a texture somewhere between crunchy and chewy and an aroma somewhere between Nirvana and Paradise. If this textural and aromatic yarn wasn't already painfully bending your senses, then the truly evil genius of adding fried dried baby shrimp to the mix surely would be the coup de grace. A small spoonful wrapped in a fresh leaf of lettuce is just evil...but in such a good good, over the top, and unexpected epiphany sort of way.I don't know, some say that there is no deader word in writing about Thai cuisine than Tom Yam or maybe it's Tom Kha. Passé. Déclassé...whatever. Have either one at A-Roy Thai and you won't remember what any of these meaningless words, these clusters of letters even mean or should mean anymore. Tom Kha is a quest for that diaphanous thread-fine balance between acid and richness, it's like trying to walk on a wisp of smoke. I'm not trying to be Zen or anything here, but haven't we all at some time or other been served something offered up putatively as Tom Kha that tasted like sour coconut cream or greasy lemon broth? Let's just say that after A-Roy Thai's Tom Kha, I'm not going to be Charlie Brown to anyone's Lucy anymore and have that football of a supposedly perfect Tom Kha cruelly ripped away from me. I'll just stick with what I know to be the very best that I've had so far, A-Roy Thai's Tom Kha.Comfort food for me comes in all kinds of strange packages. That's part of being Singaporean, I guess, taking comfort in food that you know to be good without being restrained by your heritage, background or ethnicity. Good is just good, if you're Singaporean, there is no voting along ethnic lines. Few things pick me up like laarb over rice. For me, it's like mom soothing hurt feelings after a bad day at school. You know that mom's always going to be there for you, just like you instinctively know that this simple dish of aromatic stir fried mince meat will be good and maybe even make you a better person for having had it. If you haven't yet been initiated into the mysteries of laarb, I urge you to make A-Roy Thai's your very first trip down the rabbit hole, and like Alice, your world will never be the same again.I don't know....is this enough food porn for now? It should be because unless you're reading this on your way to A-Roy Thai, you're wasting precious minutes out of your rapidly waning life reading about me enjoying the wonders of A-Roy Thai when you should be elbowing your way through their menu yourself...Get out and get some, already
4
We had lunch at A-Roy Thai for 4 persons. We ordered five dishes to be shared and all in small servings. The taste was authentic and the dishes were served hot, particularly the green curry, fish maw soup and stir-fried kailan.The restaurant was well patronized for a weekday lunch. Considering that Funan Digitalife Mall is an IT mall and not the typical fashion and retail shopping malls that draw shoppers, the lunch crowd was quite impressive.Cost of lunch was not cheap for the dishes we ordered. Fortunately, they were good and we enjoyed our lunch
5
It is located in Funan Centre on the 4th floor and for those of you who do not know what Funan is let me tell you. This is one of the electronic shopping hubs in Singapore in particular PC related items. So heading to this place for truly authentic thai food would be quiet strange. But once you get past the floors of electronic devices and arrive onto the 4th floor you will come upon Aroy Thai nestled in one corner.It is not a fancy place by any stretch of your imagination but that does not detract from the fact that outside of Thailand, this is by far one of the best thai food restaurants in Singapore.We had the lemon grass salad. 2 of them and both in a large size. A delectable, sweet, spicy and crunchy concoction that is wrapped in a lettuce leaf. The lime and chili steamed fish is out of this world which goes very well with some white rice chased down with a cold crisp Singha. The service needs some work though and as some other contributors have said it can get pricey because they do not tell what the food costs. If you fancy something spicy and just very tasty head to Funan Centre and make your way to the 4th floor to find Aroy Thai.You will not regret it

This Resturant is in a shopping mall and quite unpretentious looking but the food was most amazing n the service was prompt n we definitely got value for our money n we went back a few times as we shopped n then took a break for lunch at A Roy Thai
