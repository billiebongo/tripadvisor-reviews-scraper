Local friends have been so kind to take us here, while visiting Singapore with the family. The food is traditional Chinese and just excellent. Combined with the excellent service - it has been a great experience.

The portions are small, but the food is really amazing. We particularly loved the crispy tofu and the cod. The desserts (chilled coconut puree and chilled mango puree) were surprisingly good.

Nice ambience, perhaps dimmer lights might make it Cosier. Difficult to locate restaurant as we parked inside UE square. As first timer, we were not sure abt Lam Ann Association hence Didnt park there.Service was de best!!!!! All staff helpful & friendly. Yin v v helpful n a young 19 year old waitress fr Kedah, very friendly & helpful.Very impressed with food quality too. Chef. Well done! The fried fish skin w salted egg is out of this world!

I came because the restaurant was headed by former group executive chef of the Paradise Group. Unfortunately he had left when I visited. Food standard was very poor. The dim sum doesn't taste fresh. Service was slacked and they made a couple of wrong orders. This restaurant need a major shake up

I found this place on TA and after talking to the hotel concierge. It was a 10 minute taxi ride for the 3 of us. It was however, hard to find on the street, so keep your eyes peeled.We were to be having a late lunch.First impression - good, especially as I like it when I see the chef sitting with friends or the owner having lunch. If it is good enough for the chef to eat there, it is good enough for me.The food was good. We did not order much - some items off the dim sum menu, others a la carte. We particularly liked the abalone/scallops yum cha basket and we also enjoyed the sautéed white cabbage with garlic and the crispy roast chicken with garlic

Food was excellent. Staff very attentive and helpful. Prices reasonable for an up market setting. Quality overall is very good.Location of restaurant a bit confusing as the address is located at UE square but the actual restaurant entrance is at Mohd sultan road.Restaurant is very clean and well kept. There are quite a few chef choices such as the suckling pig with fish paste, good choices of double boiled soup.Desert was excellent... Had mango purée & pamelo shredsReservations better to reserve on weekend.Highly recommendedHappy eatin

Got to know this restaurant from groupon deal. The restaurant is located in UE square and it's facing the side road (turn in from main river valley road) and on the same stretch of restaurant as Ippudo Ramen.Would have given the restaurant 5 stars except that I don't feel that the staff are very "warm" towards groupon redemption (been there a couple of times)... I mean they are polite and all but don't have the nice homely feel... If you know what I mean...(of course, the situation is likely different if you spend big bucks in the restaurant and is a regular).Having said that, the restaurant is helmed by Chef Fung, formerly from Meritus Mandarin and Paradise group. The dim sum served were delicate and they are generous with ingredients. The ingredients used are also fresh which is important in dim sum. The items are a twist from the usual - such as glutinous rice (loh Mai gai) fried with egg (instead of just wrapped with lotus leaf), pan fried Siew Mai, seafood dumpling with curry sauce etc... Go ahead and explore the various dim sum on the menu and you won't be disappointed. An all time favourite with our family is XO carrot cake, nicely fried and tasty and Liu Sha Bao. They also serve pork ribs with century egg congee as well as fish congee. For noodles, we like the crabmeat noodles (can't recall if they call it vermicelli) or mushroom Eefu noodles. They have lovely desserts as well for those who have a sweet tooth.If you are tired if the usual Crystal Jade and Imperial treasure, it's worth a visit to this place.The restaurant is not very big (less than 100 pax) and has outdoor seating on weekends. With the groupon promotion, it's advisable to make a reservation before heading down, especially on weekends. Without the groupon redemption, the items can be slightly more ex than the usual dim sum restaurant (depending what you order)
