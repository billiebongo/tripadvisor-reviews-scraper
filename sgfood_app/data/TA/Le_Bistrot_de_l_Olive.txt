We had breakfast included daily through our stay at V Hotel Bencoolan. Everything was fresh, service always friendly and welcoming. Nothing spectacular but a nice way to start your day all the same

I used to have breakfast daily at this place. The buffet breakfast is really very nice. If you stay in V hotel then this is place where you will get complementary breakfast.

This is the Breakfast place for the V-hotel so my review it's only about that.Service rude, in 10 days I haven't seen a smiley face. Food not bad but always the same without any variety, only the way to cook it changed (two ways nothing fancy)

Had breakfasts here and Cappucino/ Baklava for tea. Staff were not friendly or generally helpful - they seemed to be just interested in making their sales numbers. Slow to clear and clean tables and replenish food . Range of food is very limited and quality not good

Went on Mon for lunch under eatigo app reservation. The hotel was undergoing renovation, thus we were the only 2 dinners. They did not compromise on their service nor food. It's French plus Middle Eastern fusion and we thoroughly enjoy their rich unusual favor. The goat cheese in the Mesclun salad was strong and appealing. Scallops were fresh and flavorful. The cream sauce in the spaghetti was mild giving a nice filling in our tummy. The grill lamb was cooked well without pungent meat smell. Food portion and presentation were good and chic. We would gladly recommend this restaurant to anyone

I visited this restaurant during Ramadan for iftar and i had a great experience. The staff is very friendly and will make sure you feel very comfortable. The food was pretty good and environment great as well.I purchased 2 vouchers from Groupon and managed to get 25% discount. The management should look to lower a bit the prices. Some dishes are quite expensive but apart from that everything else is great
