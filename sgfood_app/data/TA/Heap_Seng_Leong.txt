Dropped by after passport collection yesterday morning .. Butter kopi tasted smooth and the toasted bread was soft with delicious kaya ..
Old and tradiotional coffee shop!
Hardly can find it in Singapore ðŸ˜€

The typical vintage Chinese coffee shop you would find, with all the trappings. Expect the usual breakfast crowd tucking into toast, eggs, nasi lemak and the like.
There's also something called "kopi guyu" - coffee with some butter in it - that's worth trying.

Ordered chicken chops at $7. Portion was big and very flavourful. Coffee house Western food at kopi tiam price.

This coffeeship rustic and authentic with decorations that are unchanged over decades. Hot drinks were very well brewed, be it tea or coffee.Bread was grilled thoroughly but impecabbly over their charcoal stove by the elderly boss. Hunched and reticent, he declined to face the camera and pose. He ain't young, so make sure u try this place while he's still around

Me and my gf had a very delicious breakfast there. We paid and were happy with our food. I posted 3 pics with captions saying how cool the food is. I wanted to rate this place with five stars until i decided to go to the bathroom. I can't describe how dirty this toilet was. It was the most disgusting scene that you can imagine for a toilet. Unbelievably dirty. The stool was so dirty and black that i almost threw up. The flush doesn't work so you are gonna see bad bad things in the stool. The white walls are almost black from dirt. Next to the stool there is a even dertier bucket with water in it which I guess they will wash their bottoms with it. There is no place to wash your hands. The owner is a very old man and the waiter is a bit younger but he has almost no teeth. They prepare everything with their hands. Your toast, egg, butter on your toast, they touch everything. So I ask myself, do they wash their hands? If yes, Where?This place is a very unhygienic place and a hazard to customers' health. I wonder why the hell no inspectors in Singapore have inspected this place. Singapore seems to be very careful with hygiene!!

Was there after a quick morning session of fishing with a fishing kaki. (recommended by him)Tried their butter coffee... my first ever try of this type of coffee. A very interesting drink.. a little heavy for a morning drink but it is quite nice.Heap Send Leong is a very old coffeeshop, so don't expect much. The customers there seem to be regulars. Mostly, senior citizens.Try it! (at least once

The history and story that must be layered thick into the cooking utensils and coal stove at this place must be incredible. Butter coffee served by a dude in his PJ's that could care less about appearances of himself or his restaurant but I dare you to find a better cup of coffee. Anywhere

Our friends introduced this coffee shop. We tried the kaya toast, coffee butter and teh tarik. The taste of coffee butter is very delicious. Since we were still hungry, we also tried the nasi lemak and curry puff. They are very good. Its a traditional coffee shop where we can relax, enjoy good food and have a good chat with our friend

This place is a true time capsule and I recommend it to anyone that is interested in immersing themselves totally in the old school vibes of an authentic Singaporean neighborhood cafe. As a tourist I was totally out of place here and got a few funny looks from the locals as I took pictures with my DSLR, but the copi and kaya toast were well worth overcoming my self-consciousness for. I suppose this place is not for everyone as it is a bit run down, but for anyone looking for authenticity and opportunity to watch the locals do their thing it is ideal. The grandpa poaring the copi in his PJs is the most epic part

The coffee shop is a place that stands still in time. It offers kopi gu you which is actually coffee with condensed milk, topped with a slice of butter. The butter melts very fast and gives the drink a rich and creamy taste. It does not taste buttery. A typical meal here would a hot drink with 2 Kaya (Pandan flavoured jam) and butter toasts, 2 half boiled eggs. If you don't take coffee, you could also add butter in other hot drinks such as holick. There is also a Malay food stall in the shop, selling old school curry puffs
