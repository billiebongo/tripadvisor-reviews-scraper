A good brunch place with sandwiches, pasta, soups and English breakfast on the menu. Friendly staff and good service.

Beat Croissants if you like them european style. Breakfast overall is good. Some nice baguettes too. But really, the croissants are why you go there.

Was staying at the nearby Fraser Suites and came in for a quick take out. Got the Reuben sandwich which was very tasty. Bread was gorgeous.

It's a lovely French cafe. My children love the bread (which runs out very fast). The juices are great and I'd highly recommend it for weekend brunch.

Tucked at the back of valley point shopping centre this small cafe makes delicious meals for lunch and dinner. Worth grabbing lunch or dinner if staying nearby or at fraser suites.

The food is fresh and tasty. Surprised by the wide selection on the menu ranging from unagi-don to pancakes to bolognaise! Also have excellent bread basket and great coffee.

You can find freshly baked croissants and breads in this little cafe tucked in the corner of Valley Point. We liked their ham, brie and apple sandwich and pasta. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere.

The Fork & Knife menu item is my top pick and will certainly be something memorable for your tastebuds. It is a tantalizing combination of guacamole, spiciness from a splash of pico de gallo salsa, tangy sweetness from the delectable pulled pork, freshness from asparagus, corn and a well seasoned salad topped with their scrumptious croissants

Beware of returning food back to kitchen. Had aglio olio which was saturated in too much oil cooked like soggy wet noodles. Food was returned back to the kitchen, came back recooked by chef the aglio olio. Worse off , still drenched in too much oil with extra gummy sticky texture and the badness, more salty. The stupid chef instead of doing up new aglio olio, he had the old one recooked by adding more salt. Guess what happened next day? Woke up with virus phlegmy sore throat. There is a grain of truth, never returned back food back to kitchen, Chances are the chefs will spit on the recooked / new order of food, not happy customer returned food back to kitchen

My local friends took me to Croute for breakfast. They mainly serve french style food and their croissant was great. Unfortunately their chocolate croissant was not ready so we had to settle for the plain kind. I had eggs benedict which is a bit not traditionally but still very good. Their cappuccino was good also. All in all great breakfast place that I would not mind going back agai

I always enjoy going to Croute. Very laid back environment. Their menu is good and healthy. They have variety of choices on their menu, some Japanese dishes, middle eastern and more. Must try!

We didn't try this little cafe until our last day (with great regret). They bake beautiful bread here and have a wonderful array of fresh salads. A quite extensive menu.

Solid food, solid flat white, very quiet and chilled. Quick service. Yup could see this becoming a regular spot for me.

One of the best cafes to unwind and treat yourself with quality imported food and beverage. My fav. is the mocha, ham and brie sandwich and chocolate cake.

Cute cafe/bakery in a small shopping complex, they have a great breakfast and lunch menu, so great that we returned many times! What made it so great was the more 'western' options that they had on their menu, sometimes its so hard to find a decent salad for lunch and these guys succeeded. The coffee was also really good too, again sometimes hard to find in Singapore. I highly recommend the salads and the granola on the breakfast menu

If you are an expat looking for the european croissant and breads similar to those of Paris or Vienna, there is nothing like Croute. Service can be very friendly or unfriendly, depending on the cashier's mood of the day. And he is moody. But otherwise, breakfast (and cakes? is top and the place is cozy. No windows though..

Popped in for a spot on lunch.Nice atmosphere about the place with a mix of clientele. You approach the counter and read the menu which is mounted above the counter on the wall. Good variety of salads sandwiches and other hot food. I went for a Parma ham and mozzarella sandwich with truffle fries. Coffee and fresh orange. Very tasty and good size portion. I would visit again

This restaurant has very simple way of furnishing but food and coffee is good. Cappuccino is very good for me. My favorite main course is steak frites which is a steak serve with home made gravy and truffle fries (very good). The burger is good too. Fish and chips which comes with home made pink tartar sauce is not bad. I also tried the ham and cheese panini (good and tasty). Highly recommende

This is a nice place at the river valley road. It is not very easy to locate as it is in the building complex on the ground floor. So look carefully. it is worth the little extra effort for the eats that they have are really nice. We had 4 people on the table each with a different taste and appetite and each one had options and found it good.The coffee and juices are well made. A tad expensive if you want to have a three course meal but then tastes authentic and worth for formal catch up and personal too.The service is helpful and team is well equipped on suggesting you the food basis your preferences and requests. Over the weekend it is a little quite and fun to catchup on your favourite reading material over a bite and shake

Love this place! Cheap, cheerful, everyday food. Situated beneath our appt...Fraser Suites...this is a great little cafe. Fab fresh juices. Brilliant poached eggs..... Did laugh when we asked for them to be runny and they said, 'so, rare eggs?' They were perfect! Good coffee too. Visit regularly
