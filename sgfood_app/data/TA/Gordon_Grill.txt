We had lunch here and picked up the 3 course set lunch. We shared everything. It was very good and satisfying. The desserts were awesome. Good ambiance and good service too.
5
steaks are presented at your table so you have choice of cuts and size you would like. cooked to perfection medium rare in my case. curry snails was an interesting interpretation. lobster bisque very good

Situated inside the lovely Goodwood Park Hotel, Gordon Grill is a Michelin rated restaurant known for its steak.We tried the set 3 course lunch menu. The food was amazing but the lot portions were miniscule.Expensive, good ambience and great food. Just wish they would serve a bit more.
5
Great experience when you order a steak they wheel the trolley over with all the different meats eg; wagyu, ribeye etc & he asks you how many grams you would like then he cuts & weighs it to perfection!!Nearly to the exact weight. You pay per gram & with an array of sauces to your choice. Beautiful & fresh best we have had in Singapore.Dessert order Crepe Suzettes which is the same deal & cooked beside your table flaming! We ordered the trio of soups for Entree which we were told about & definitely a hit.Service wine list ambience all 5 star

My wife wanted to go here for her birthday dinner. Gordon Grill is a Michelin Red Star restaurant. We expected something good and were not disappointed. The fillet steak I had was absolutely superb and cooked to perfection (medium rare - not virtually cremated as too many Singaporean steakhouses seem to do it). My wife's lamb chops were also excellent.Mains are roughly $50 to $70 per head (meat only) plus about $9 per side dish (to be shared). The mash potato was the American style with too much butter for my liking, and not a particularly generous helping. We also had some portobello mushrooms which were just about perfect. The wine list was split between the very expensive and reasonably priced. In Singapore it's always going to be pricey, but $90 for a bottle of excellent Argentinian Malbec was very reasonable by Singaporean standards - I'd recommend this option to others.Tea and coffee prices were a bit steep ($9 for a cup of Twinings Mint tea is a bit much when the tea bag they're using is worth about 50 cents), but the deserts are not too outrageous (I was tempted to have the trifle $14 but my wife stopped me because she wants me to lose a bit of weight!). Again putting this in context this is a higher class restaurant in a fairly expensive city.To sum up. Gordons Grill is a good steakhouse and much better value than Morton's of Chicago (which is located the Mandarin Oriental). If you budget around $100 per head you can have a sensibly sized good meal for 3 people (depending on what you choose - some options are much more pricey). Tip: If you pay with a Citibank or UOB credit card they'll give you a 14% discount (which reduces the pain on the wallet a wee bit!).Service is excellent. Parking is easy (around $6.00 for two hours

My wife and I had the duo of tenderloin and Waygo cheek, and meaty New Zealand lamb chops, both memorable. Our appetizers - mushroom soup and Caesar salad were each in its was distinct and good. We had considered other nearby choices of good restaurants and were well satisfied with our selection

We've enjoyed the local fare, especially the street food here in Singapore, but now it was time for some really good Western food.We hit the jackpot with the Gordon Grill located right in our hotel, Goodwood Park. This restaurant is entirely consistent with the theme of the hotel which is a modern version of the colonial past of Singapore.The decore and ambience are quiet and understated, very welcoming and comfortable.The service was impeccable, and the food was creative, tasty, well prepared and presented. Our waitress was particularly engaging, and very adept at handling the selection and carving of the smoked salmon and my cut of steak.Of course this is Singapore, so expect to pay a premium price commensurate with the quality

To begin with - you will not appreciate this place if you do no like beef, and I mean like "I really-really-like-and-obsess-on-beef-ratings" kind of beef connoisseur. I went with my wife for my birthday celebration. Beautiful decor and very quite for nice relaxing couples dinner. Outstanding service by the staff - friendly, knowledgeable and they gave us proper advise on our choices.The meat choices, while expensive (what did you expect?), are some of the best I have seen in Singapore and there's lots of variety to choose from.My wife had a "meat medley" dish and I had a Wagyu steak - medium rare, for mains. The Wagyu was exceptional - each bite was juicy and you could feel the difference in taste when compared to the normal steaks you get, and so was her foie gras.It's definitely priced on the higher side, but given this is advertised as a high-end steak place, it's not surprising. It's definitely good for romantic dinners (who like beef, I need to emphasize this again!) and special occasions.Revisit Likelihood - Looking forward for the next excuse to visit
5
It is a delight to be offered the various meats prior to their cooking and select exactly what you want - to see the quality then receive it on your plate transformed into a delicious art form. The service is both friendly and polite as one enjoys fine dining.Little disappointed that the Highland theme has gone from the decor and dres

We went for the set lunch on a Saturday. Three of us went for the cheaper promotional set lunch($38++) by a credit card. However although it was three course with coffee/tea, there was no choice at all for the appetiser, main(chicken only) and dessert. One of us chose the normal set lunch($55++) which includes soup, appetiser, main, dessert and coffee/tea. All courses come with choices. For main, there are fish and beef to choose as well.What really stood out on that day was the excellent service. Staff were polite and made us feel comfortable
5
We had dinner here with my business partner, we really enjoyed the quality of the foods, wines and services. The best dish here that we had is the Wagyu beef. I think this is the signature dish of this restaurant.
4
Old fashioned courteous service and truly spectacular wagyu fillet steak. Only small criticism was the lack of choice and imagination for red wine by the glass. Great food however was ample compensation.
4
What Gordon lacks somewhat in ambiance and flavor is certainly compensated by the excellent service. From the choice of wine to the best cut of beef is available to you from the serving staff. The meat that we selected was cut in front of us. A style not available at many places anymore. Meat was decently prepared. Overall a good experience. The sides were not excellent and the tomato used for plating had wilted. Steak was very good. Truly exceptional service by the manager. Worth a tr
5
From the moment the waiter brings a small chair for your companions handbag you know you are in for a treat. A simple menu with an emphasis on American ingredients ie Idaho potatoes and corn fed beef. The cooking like the waiting staff is quietly understated but very very good. Expensive but worth it if you want a real treat.
4
We were there for a birthday celebration. The restaurant called on the day itself to confirm our reservations. It opens at 7pm. We were the only ones in the restaurant till almost 8pm when another 2 groups came in. We had 3 sets of the Duo beef, where it consist of wagyu beef, beef cheek, some vegetables and mashed potatoes. The medium wagyu was perfect but the beef cheek tastes more like opened from the can. Also ordered the Kurobuta pork. The cook did not make good use of the pork to cook it well. We also had 3 different types of soup. The lobster bisque was great! We also had the appetizers, foie gras and half dozen escargot. Both were great to
5
Not like a traditional Steak House, which is a good thing; the waiter brings you a tray of meat and you the select your cut and desired weight. You then proceed to play a game with the waiter to see if he can guess the right weight by sight (Its charming, but tedious after doing it with all our party). The meat is cioked perfect and the sides are outstanding... I would recommend you go for any of the Wagyu Steaks, and accompany it with creamed spinach and their famous whipped Yukon mash!! Don't expect a cheap night out, but be guaranteed to come away with good memories and 100% satisfaction! I'm going to go out on a limb and say the best restaurant service in Singapore!

Just had lunch at this venerable gastronomic institution. The set lunch is a steal for the food quality, attention from staff and peaceful ambience. At $50+ for a 3 course or $60+ for 4 course meal, it feels well worth the money. What's really great is the 3-mini portion starters (which you can choose from 5 items) and 2-mini portion dessert (out of choice of 3) is what I would say is a yummy sampler. It was asparagus season and the white variety was very nicely done. Sweet with freshness and light touch of Béarnaise sauce to accompany it. Subtle on the palate with sufficient texture to chew on. Very satisfying. Still a go to for a simple celebration meal.
5
From the get-go, the service was top-notch. All their staff were attentive, responsive and really good. It's pretty obvious that they pride themselves in the service department. The food was equally good as well. It was the first time i actually experience meat being cut/weight in front of our table before being cooked. The rib eye was so tender and value for money. I would probably be charged over 100SGD for this kind of quality at other steakhouses. I was surprised that they have Idaho Potatoes here as well. Overall, it's really a nice and cosy restaurant to bring your loved ones for an anniversary, celebration or just a get-together for chit chat. It's reasonably priced and definitely value for money for the kind of quality food and services

This restaurants serves the classics but I was overwhelmed with the Crêpe Suzette prepared by Maria. She simply did it with style, at ease and perfect, like a master chef should do it!!! Well done Maria, you prepared me my best ever Crêpe Suzette like I've never eaten before... (and trust me, I've eaten a lot all around the world).Thx to the whole team for this delicious dinner experience so far away from home
5
We have raved about this restaurant since eating here in 2010 and finally took the family for a meal this week. Our poor grandson could not stay awake and the staff were fantastic and even brought a pillow for him to lie on. The food is simply the best around and the service second to none. We still think this is one of the must visit restaurants around and not just in Singapore. Be back on our next visit to Singapore. A++++
5
Something different in Singapore. Old classical style.You could select your steak and it was grilled exactly to your wishes.The staff out of the box professional and friendly. Top marks
5
Had lunch for 17 people. Staff was very helpful and service was really good and attentive! Special thanks to Krishna, Maria, Gary, Clement and Max for an enjoyable lunch. Food was really good.
5
I was looking for a steak house and Gordon Grill was just 200 m away from my hotel. With my colleague we went there, we really enjoyed everything: large choice of beef, good wine list and a service at the top.
5
I have been here many times over the past years and honestly they do the most delicious steak in Singapore. It is beautifully cooked and presented and the meat is top quality. They also do delicious soups which I always have as my starter. It has a lovely atmosphere and excellent service.
4
Located in the Teutonic Grand Dame of the Goodwood Park Hotel,the grill room look a bit dated. Not a great menu selection,but later I realized that whatever they feature,they were all great. A five elements of cranberry,lychee,pineapple,mango and champagne ice cubes cocktail got our meal off to a great start. My pan seared foie gras was cooked perfectly. Ditto my friend's Hokkaido scallops. The lobster bisque was full on flavor and richness though a little more dash of flambé brandy would have been perfection. The Sunday roast beef was well seasoned,nicely pink and served with an almost perfect Yorkshire pudding and gravy. Service was attentive but I do find the staffs chatted slightly prolongly to many of the regular guests
5
Our regular stop over here is around truffle time and I can't help but over indulge. The beef checks with root veg and some truffle followed by a perfectly done crape, does life get any better. The service is just so attentive you could settle in for the night
5
I came here to have my birthday dinner and initially I was having doubts with this restaurant but the name just keeps ringing a bell. I came in as skeptic and now I am convert to this restaurant! This restaurant offers you the most honest food! You pay for what was cut for you and the most delicate servers will recommend which cut offer you the taste that will be delivered! The meat are all prepared on a wagon and you will see the selection of the day and it's cut and weigh in front of you! Price is extremely reasonable with a decent cut and a decent price $$ Best of all they serve Crepe Suzette !!And it's awesome
4
Set lunch has 2 menu. Tried menu A. For the price, it offers Value in its selection. Went for the king crab pasta and roast beef. Both are of decent quality. The roast beef comes with Yorkshire pudding which I usually crave. Was slightly disappointed with it though. The lobster bisque was quite good. It comes with choice of coffee or tea. You may even choose ice mocha.

I had my first wedding anniversary at the Gordon Grill and for the past few years have been treated to a birthday lunch here by a good friend. The Grill is not as old fashioned as it was and the tires tartan decor has been replaced by modern landscapes of the Scottish highlands. The menu is now big on small things. The set lunch features a choice of three miniature portions of starters, three of soups, one hearty main course and two of desserts plus tea or coffee for $48++ I chose a trio of starters featuring salmon trout, crab and scallop. Each was exquisite. I chose the mushroom, French onion and asparagus soups. The mushroom came with a generous slice of truffle and I wish it had been full size. The French onion was so-so and the asparagus a tad sweet. The main course was catch of the day, unidentifiable as overcooked and rubbery which was a pity as the prawns it came with were fresh and well cooked and the Provençal vegetables were good. My friend had a mini apple crumble and a caramel for dessert which she enjoyed. The Grill uses TWG tea which is a superior brew but such a pity there was the single cup and no one came to offer a refill. Service started solicitously and then tailed off. The bread basket came late. The apology came with the bread, but should have preceded the bread. No one asked if the meal was ok despite seeing my leftover fish and my friends quite raw bit of beef. I wish they could be bigger on some smaller things! Although, it was a pleasant lunch, for the price more perfect cooking is perhaps a reasonable expectation?
4
The service was great throughout the meal. I had steak and a cart was wheeled out with the joints of beef and we were shown the different cuts which was great. The food was excellent and the steak was cooked perfectly to my request. The side dishes were the only disappointment. The French fries were straight from the freezer judging by the taste and I would really have expected fresh cut and cooked
5
Great meal! Had the chefs 6 course meal. Came with pasta, salmon, foie gras, slow cooked egg w chorizo, lamb or steak, and for desert either apple tart or creme brulee.
5
We had 6 course meals here. The food was very good. Loving every dishes they serve especially the angel hair pasta with caviar. The service was attentive too! Will definitely revisit!
4
We eat her every couple of months or so - the food quality and service is not to be faulted. The décor is very beige, but If you can live with this then try it out. Expensive compared to most, a bargain compared to Mortons.
3
Went back to the Gordon Grill after many years away from Singapore.
The Steak was as I wanted but the accompany dishes lacking.
Very pricy but worth it.
The old Scottish style has been lost a bit.
5
Well what can I say, the restaurant was truly perfect. We were welcomed friendly staff. The steaks were cooked perfectly and whole experience was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant for business and couples. Would return.
5
Selected Gordon Grill after some deliberation as I had stayed at Goodwood Park Hotel and liked the old world charm of the place. The experience turned out to be better than expected. The best part of the experience was our server Krishna who complemented the decor, charm and the food quality with his superlative service.He brought various steaks to our table and helped us select a Aus Wagyu with a 8to 9 MBS. Since one of us on the table wanted to go light on the dinner, he offered to cut in half a 300 gms piece in two to share. We also ordered half a kilo of white asparagus and skipped the starters. He suggested a reasonably priced 2013 chilean Cabernet Sauvignon as well. We discovered that the wine was an excellent choice.Third person on the table ordered grilled tiger prawns and she was also raving.The slightly understated ambience went very well with the old world charm and helped get into a good conversation on the table. In the end Krishna offered to make crepe suzette for desert on hour table. The crepe experience was befitting as the finale of a very pleasant evening. The icing on the cake was a reasonable S$ 400 bill. Will visit again
5
My wife and I went there and had lunch set. $55 for 3 course or $65 for 4course plus coffee /tea. Quality of foods was great and staffs were very attentive. I loved chilled pasta for entree and it was full of caviar and black truffle. Steak and fish of the day were above average. Coffee was pretty much average hotel coffe though but overall very good value for reputation of the hotel
5
This is the second time I have had the pleasure of eating here. The tasting menu is superb - a selection of three appetizers (from 6), three soups from 5), a main course then, if you opt for it, a choice of two deserts (from 4). Every dis was great and the tasting menu allows you to sample so much more of the chef's excellence. Coupled with excellent service, this is a must for a fine dining lunch
5
Had a birthday dinner last week and lunch yesterday. Both visits were good. Highly recommended! Set lunch was really good value for money with so many choices! Special mention to Krishna, Maria and team for good service rendered! The only downside was the very expensive parking charges. $20 for about 3 hours and it is outside CBD! Would really help if the management can offer complimentary parking for diners
5
Situated at the Goodwood Park Hotel, this restaurant just ticked all the boxes for us. Fine dining with Gueridon service, the steaks cut at your table then cooked to perfection as you like them. A wine list of international dimensions. We chose snow crab salad and lobster bisque for entrees followed by fillet steaks (one medium the other rare) with a couple of sides accompanied by 2008 Beaune. It was excellent. Ambiance wise it is probably a quiet place overall, however, when we were there we arrived at the same time as 7 loud businessmen who bought their own wine, so probably regulars. The staff moved us so we could be a little quieter. We will be coming back agai
4
Good for business lunches, great ambiance, quiet, excellent service.
Food quality is also very, very good.
5
The old adage of you get what you pay for is so true. This is fine dinning and some of the best steaks I have eaten have been here. The service is just great friendly with good advice, it is a regular stop for us.
5
Gordon Grill is one of my favourite places to eat. Good food, good service and nice environment. Their set lunches are perfect and a die die must try.
5
This restaurant serves some of the best steak in Singapore. Staff are friendly and helpful. Pieces of beef are brought to the table so you can choose your own cut and it's fun when the waiters guess the weight of your steak before placing it on the scales, they're never far wrong! Try the unusual poached egg starter - very different and delicious. Instead of (or as well as!) dessert, why not order a Cafe Diablo and watch as your waiter prepares it at your table, including igniting a swirl of orange peel - great fun and delicious too
5
We had lunch yesterday at this restaurant. As we had made reservations, it was a breeze getting table at a quiet little corner. The staff, Mr Krishna was a great help from the moment he came to take our order. He made good recommendations and yet without being too pushy. The food was served well and on time. The Sunday roast is a special where a 4 course meal for $65 is a steal. The restaurant has the meat in the trolley system where the staff explains the various meat and cuts. My boys chose the wagyu beef which was delectable and it was cooked to perfection. I had the 4 course which was a feast. What made it enjoyable was the smiling faces and quick service. The restaurant is also family friendly and I noticed a few families there at the same time. The service by Krishna was outstanding. He was cool and knew when to leave us alone and when to come in. We had a great time
4
We enjoyed a delicious 3 course meal served by attentive and informative waiters in a simple but well maintained dining room.To start off, we were served with a choice of delicious breads with butter.We had 3 choices of both appetizers and soups. The sampler portions were ample, tasty and excellently cooked. Our main course of Angus beef tenderloin was perfect - tender and well decorated with mashed potatoes, vegetables and smothered with a delicious sauce.2 tasty desserts followed by coffee or tea completed the meal. Altogether a tasty and satisfying meal
5
This restaurant is open for lunch and dinner,and is well patronized by locals and in house guests wanting good quality steaks (Wagu beef comes to the table on a trolley you choose a cut ,it is weighed and the cost calculated).The menu gives lots of choices with beef from Australia & USA.Women will like the mini chair supplied to rest their handbags on,an upmarket restaurant but worth the little extra to enjoy the best steaks in Singapore
4
I love the set lunch.You will able to choose you appetizer, soup, main course and dessert. you can op for 3 courses...etcI love the way they serve the soup and appetizer, small and generous portion in 3 different flavours (you make the choice).If you are a small eater, op out the dessert. Remember to make your reservation in advance

I've been wanting to visit the Gordon Grill for the past couple of years, since a few friends whose taste in restaurants I trust recommended it. Established in 1963, the Gordon Grill has a reputation for consistently good western fare. I hear - from someone whose own roast lamb is excellent - that their roast lamb is exceptional. I finally went to the Gordon Grill for a celebratory meal with my family and it lived up to its reputation. I had quail with a chunk of foie gras on top that was finger-licking good. My husband and daughter had a ribeye and a wagyu steak, chosen from a trolley of meats. They too said that their steaks were of excellent quality and cooked to perfection.The service was good. The only thing that disappointed me was the decor. A review that I read of the restaurant referred to decor more befitting a Scottish castle than the tropics. Another mentioned tartan furnishings. That said, the first review was written in 2004. Today the restaurant looks like any coffee shop in any hotel anywhere in the world. I wish the major renovation that the restaurant underwent (as the waitress told me) a few years ago had revived the Scottish decor in keeping with the restaurant's original flavour. All in all though we were very happy to have visited the Gordon Grill and will be back
5
This restaurant provided our best ever dining experience! The restaurant was very classy, staff very attentive, everything was a lot more than we expected. Superb food and so well presented, which is just how we have seen it on the Masterchef programs. We noted that the restaurant had been awarded Top Restaurant for 2013 & 2014 and were not surprised! Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a great dining experience
3
Just had Sunday lunch here but a bit expensive. The restaurant was clean, the atmosphere was lovely and the staff very friendly
5
We were staying at the Goodward Park anyway, so being tired and ready for something to eat, we wandered into the Gordon Grill. Like going back 50+ years into the colonial days. Wonderful service and exquisite food.Expensive but worth it.
5
Excellent food and service, we only came here once even though we were staying at the hotel but it is certainly well worth a visit, not the cheapest place to eat but definitely quality.
4
Revisited the restaurants a couple of times since. Service has improved and the service staffs tried their very best. The lady is fabulous and very attentive. Food as usual is good. Keep up!
5
Absolutely love this place for their beef. They serve one of the best wagyu beef. You get to pick your beef from a wagon, and Krishna is in charge. Get him to do the cut, can't go wrong. For appetizer, I personally like the daily fresh oysters (gillardeau) and the escargots. If you like soup - the lobster bisque is magnificent, rich in flavor. If you like French onion soup, try the Gordon classic French onion soup. Our kids totally love the in house baked bread, especially the soft rolls. We had an enjoyable steak dinner

I cannot rave enough about this gastronomic experience in the exquisite setting of Gordon Grill in the heritage Goodwood Park Hotel in Singapore which may be only outranked by the Raffles Hotel. I come to the Far East to savour the local food but our friend who invited us there thought we might miss our Western food. I usually find Western food in the East to be somewhat pretentious but not this one. I had (he died of a catastrophic stroke recently) a dear friend who was a culinary chef and he always insisted on making dinner for occasions at our house because he thought what they charged at fancy restaurants were exorbitant and he could do the same creations for almost nothing. I can tell Guy now, if he can hear me, that the set menu lunch at Gordon Grill may be dear but it is not expensive. For SGD65 we had a choice of 3 appetisers, 3 soups, 1 main course, 2 desserts and an irresistible basket of garlic bread, individual sized baguettes and shrimp sticks with dip. The main was full sized and the others were supposed to be small samplers but the portions were quite generous. By the time the main course arrived, I regretted not being able to do justice to the perfectly grilled Angus beef tenderloin. I wished I had taken a photograph of the menu choices because I could recall exactly my choices, and I could not find them on Gordon Grill's website as they seem to change their menus often. A friend of mine says that fancy restaurants have fancy descriptions of an ordinary dish so they can charge fancy prices. He believes in getting good value. I wish I have all the fancy descriptions for him. There was exceptional value especially since our host paid the bill. I do not have good pictures of our menu choices but you can always find good pictures that others have posted of their meals at Gordon Grill on the Internet
5
during our recent stay at Goodwood Park Hotel, we dined twice at Gordon Grill. A Degustation Dinner for Valentines Day, and again with the a la carte menu. Food was absolutely divine on each occasion, and an excellent wine list that lets you easily match to your food. Service was friendly, helpful, unobtrusive.
4
Had a business lunch here and the service and food was excellent. Had the mushroom soup which was delicious. The catch of the day that I ordered was nicely done and seasoned well. The Banana crumble was also very well prepared and not too sweet but just right. Next time round, I would expect it to be even better as I would order the angel hair pasta appetiser, Steak for main and try another of their desserts
3
this was the place in the 80s and 90s for steak. it has gone thru some reno as part of the hotel reno program few years ago. the setting is a little too open for comfort. if you wanna have a business meal, do ask for the corners for privacy. ask for the meat selection and the manager will push the trolley out with the various cuts on displayed. Back to Basic indeed! you select what you like without any surprises.good on this!
2
Arrived at restaurant before 1pm. Restaurant is only 50% full and the menu takes ages to arrive. First they ignored me and then they said will come soon. When I asked if it is because they do not have enough menu, they finally admitted. Could have been more upfront with this. For a restaurant in a 5 star hotel, it is appalling to run out of menu for customers. Will think twice about visiting this restaurant again as service is also lacking although food is good
4
Interesting steak restaurant - cuts of meat are brought to the table for you to select, and decide how much steak you want. Very good service, if a little pricy.
4
Superb range of stakes presented as full joints on the bone to view prior to carving and serving. Expensive!
3
we did the tasting menu. I think the service was a bit OTT. They filled our glasses after every sip which was unecessary as the two of us where having a business lunch and I did not like the interruptions however discreet. They also speed you up, asked us to order dessert when we ordered the main. There were only three tables busy so not sure what the rush was to get us out of there. Food however, was goo

This was a birthday treat so we were looking for somewhere a bit special. The Birthday Girl prefers European Cuisine and loves steak. We are, ahem, quite mature so were looking for somewhere comfortable and relaxed. Being relatively new to Singapore I did some research and it seemed to be down to the Gordon Grill and Morton's. I was put off Morton's as a few recent reviews implied that there were too many tables and it could be noisy.On arrival at the Goodwood, we were shown into a cocktail bar adjoining the restaurant and started with glasses of fizz. This whole ground floor area was presumably open in the original hotel design but the space between columns has now been filled with plate glass to create a partitioned are for the cocktail bar. It is a pleasant experience being slightly cocooned whilst watching the bizz of the hotel go by.Having been shown to our table and given menus we then enjoyed the theatre of the selection, cutting and weighing of our steaks. It was also refreshing to be asked to describe how we wanted our steaks cooked, not just rare, medium... And when the steaks came back they had been cooked precisely to specification in all cases. I know that should not be remarkable in itself, but frankly it is, in my experience. The staff were helpful with advice when ordering, even talking us out of choosing too many side dishes.A final piece of theatre was the flaming of crepe suzette by the table.The meal was certainly expensive but every component was top quality and for the wines that I roughly knew the retail price of, the mark-up was not exceptional.At the end of the evening we all agreed this was one of the best meals we had had (and, again, we're none of us teenagers).We're all now impatiently waiting for the next birthday so we can go back again

You select your cut of beef and "doneness" and they deliver. And while waiting enjoy the soup trio or salad. Going over the top was adding steak tartare for an appetiser, like we did. Most of us opted for the sirloin, I opted for the fillet and the children? Hamburgers - delivered by the cafe.And when the Main came, it was faultlessly delicious, mouth-wateringly good.For dessert we shared the sampler plus the classic sherry trifle.We shared our memories of the restaurant - good food is good food, the scene of many a family birthday, and I remembered when management gave away chairs before a much earlier renovation! "Comfort food" - the comfort of reliable service and food across the decade
5
I admit to being a fan of the Gordon Grill. It's never let me down.It is a rather small, cozy place, a bit off of Scott's Road in one of the oldest hotels in the city. It is reserved, but not at all stuffy.Service is excellent and the staff are helpful and good with their recommendations.I always ask about the catch of the day and in my many years of coming to the restaurant, have yet to be disappointed. This time I had a pan fried Sea Bass that was superb; succulent, very fresh, and spot on.The restaurant is known for its beef. But if you want to avoid beef, the fresh fish is a very safe bet and be sure to ask the head water his recommendation. The head water is also very capable of recommending wines and the restaurant stocks a respectable selection.Gordon Grill is not cheap. In fact, it is expensive. But when you are satisfied, price is really not the issue.I have come here in the past, many times. I look forward to coming again
5
The Gordon Grill is a very nice place to visit and dine. The hotel itself is one of the historical hotels of Singapore, built just after Raffles Hotel. So, there is a great history here. Sadly the Gordon Grill and much of the hotel has been renovated to the point of "modern". Yet, be aware that I am supremely critical of taking the "old world" ambiance out of places.Now, the Grill...They offer a three course or four course fixed price menu and the food is elegant. We had the lobster bisque which was superb and the onion soup which was good but not superb.We also had the steak tartar appetizer and the escargot. I think the escargot was good but beware that it in a red sauce with what appeared to be a splash of pesto possibly. Not your traditional by any means nor was the tartar of beef. The tartar visually was more like a slice of pate rather than a true steak tartar. For our main courses we had the coque au vin....absolutely excellent! Also the tenderloin of beef which was very good. Lastly we were there to try their individual baked Alaska but they were out. This is hard to imagine as it isn't something generally made well in advance and should always be available. However that was my ONLY complaint.Instead we had a lemon meringue pie and the apple tart with homemade vanilla ice cream. The tarts and ice cream are tiny but very tasty. The ice cream must have been made on site. Actually the called it a sorbet but I beg to differ. It was creamy and luxurious.The service was exemplary. OH, by the way, you can order Alacarte so do not fear!!

The Gordon Grill, like the Goodwood Park Hotel where it is located, is a Singaporean institution. And with good reason.The restaurant is well lit and decorated with modern paintings of Scottish scenery. As you would expect, the table linen is exactly that - no paper napkins in sight. Overall it has a very pleasant ambience with a clearly western style. Service is provided by an ensemble cast seamlessly fulfilling their respective roles.As a grill-room, it specialises in steak. Faultless, top quality meat. You get to chose the cut at your table. There is also a good menu of alternative western cuisine mains, with a selection of traditional starters and sweets. It has been a while since I have been at a loss to make a choice from a menu due to the sheer number of appealing familiar dishes. No silly sauces, no deconstructed classics, nothing nouvelle.The food we had was superb. Simple quality fare. While I had a piece of Australian fillet (better than any I have had in Australia), my partner tried wagyu beef steak and cheeks (couldn't see what the wagyu fuss is but loved the dish nevertheless). I also enjoyed having a crepe suzette (made at the table of course) for the first time in decades - it was really good.There used to be lots of restaurants like this all around the world. Most of them have gone. This makes a meal at the Gordon Grill all the more enjoyable. It is pricey, but worth it. I would definitely eat here again

Most people would describe this restaurant as ''old fashioned'' and conservative. I like the classic approach to dining - from a no nonsense menu specializing in steaks, to linen covered tables, uniformed service staff and discreet halogen lights onto your table. Service staff is well trained and know what they are doing, with some of them having worked there for some 20 years. The beef is brought to your table and cut and weighted in front of you. Corkage charge at $50 is not cheap, but for some reasons high in most steak restaurants. Food was excellent and our wine was opened professionally. I have three points which I feel can be improved: Wine was opened on another table far away from mine, until I kept looking over and then he brought the wine to our table to open. I feel expensive bottles of wines must be opened and decanted in front of the guest. Second; the steak knife was not sharp, nor was it a classic steak knife, Third: no pepper mill, no salt on the table. ( No problem for us, we travel with our own pepper mill). For young people this restaurant may just be a bit too quiet, too subdued. I am however happy such restaurants still exist

I have been enjoying Gordon Grill's English style food for more than 30 years. It is one of the oldest western restaurants in Singapore, open in 1963 when Singapore's restaurant business was relatively primitive compares to current day. Their consistency and continuous improvement are commendable. The long serve and well trained staff adds a valuable sense of familiarity and nostalgic to the old school elegant setting. The festive set launch is real great value for money. S$58++ for 3-course and S$68++ for 4-course, a choice from five types of appetisers, soups, main courses and desserts each, plus coffee and tea. The food quality is superior. My favourites are their Angel hair pasta with caviar, lamb chop, premium beef steak and all of their desserts are irresistible, credit goes to their excellent pastry chef! And of course they have an impressive selection of wine too. My favourite dining place whenever I missed the good old days

Just had lunch today and chose the set menu. Have to say it was excellent and great value for your money. Thoroughly recommend it. Service also very good. You won't be disappointed.

We ate here on a recent stopover visit to Singapore. It is not a particularly cheap option, but we felt it was well worth the price.

Excellent little restaurant with a bit of history on the ground floor at 5 Star Goodwood Park hotel. Steaks are superb and service every thing you would expect.

Ordered the Chef's recommended "Prawn noodles soup" Had high expectation which fell flat. Was rather disappointed and did not finish it. My daughter had the Goodwood Park burger which was juicy and great.She totally enjoyed it.

With the plethora of places and cuisines available in town, a plain old grill-room might be an odd choice. But we were all shagged-out, and decided to just eat in the hotel instead of schlepping off to somewhere trendier. What a serendipitous choice it turned out to be; the girls had crab salad and Three Soups, each of which far outstripped its description in flavour and composition. I had baked snails which I can only describe as a revelation; unlike any escargot I've ever experienced anywhere before. I could cheerfully dine on a dozen or so of these and a hunk of bread!Subsequent steaks were perfect. Service by Krishna was exemplary, yet subtle. The evening was, as I say, a delightful surprise

Gordon Grill celebrates its 50th anniversary and had a promotional set lunch menu. My family has been there on and off, and we have good memories. This time it was a little underwhelming, although the promotional prices were great. Some things that fell short:1. Inconsistent service. Every time I went to the grill in the past, they offered me a chair for my bag. It's one of the things I liked about the place. This time, they didn't. I thought the policy had changed, and didnt make an issue of it. But I saw other tables with chair bags later. I wonder if it was because I was in a large family group with young children? Why should that make any difference?2. Inattentive staff: plates took ages to get cleared, which is something you don't expect in a restaurant of this calibre. My son's lunch plate only got cleared at the end of the meal, even after he had ordered and eaten his dessert. I had to move the plates to the side of the table.3. Underwhelming food: I wonder if this is due to the promotional menu. We always ordered ala carte in the past. It's good value, but I felt underwhelmed. The only redemption was the baked Alaska, which was quite decent. The signature trifle was a letdown. Perhaps this is the sort of place you best enjoy in adult company, and ordering ala carte

Was just there last night with family and a baby. Sorry to say I completely enjoyed the generous serving of Foie gras that was crispy on the outside and juicy soft inside.. completely sinful. Lobster bisque was excellent too. Key feature are the selection of steaks that are brought to your table. Charged by wt, you just say how much you want and the gentleman who serves cuts the raw slab out with incredible accuracy (give or take a few grams). I love service with a smile and just the appropriate of friendliness. I ordered an 250g Angus Rib eye tasted great but even as I enjoyed it I was slightly envious of the 300g tenderloin that was being chewed up just opposite me (cut thick and perfectly done - pinky red and moist on the inside without bloody juices oozing around).Also loved it that they were so tolerant of us sitting around 45 min after our deserts and coffee even though we knew they were getting ready to close up. Not a word to rush us along at all.What I like is the consistency. Been here at least 4 times now and each time getting what I expect

We have stayed at the Goodwood Park Hotel twice and one of the reasons is because of this restaurant. It's fabulous. It's not cheap but the food is always excellent and the staff are amazing, so attentive. When we returned this year the waiter Krishna remembered us from the previous year, how many restaurants have staff like that. Thank you Krishna and all the other staff for making our visit to Gordon Grill so special

A few years ago Gordons was a bit of an institution with a bit of history around it. Updated decor does not set it aside from many other restaurants, and there are better places for steak elsewhere in Singapore. Nothing really bad to say about the place, just not as enjoyable as it used to be
5
An excellent restaurant on the first floor of the 5 star Goodwood hotel. For lunch the set menu is interesting, with a 'tasting menu' choice of three choices from their soups and three more from their desserts, along with a main course. Excellent wine list as well

Liked quality of steaks served this day! Just great! Did not like the wine list (expensive and so-so selection). A little too slow service.

don't go to morton's for steak. here is so much better and more quantity and quality!!!!

Gordon Grill serves some of the best steaks in Singapore. There is a selection of beef that you can choose from the tray and you can indicate exactly how many grams you want. They slice and weigh it. Awesome! Especially when it's quite pricey. Lol~~But seriously, steaks here are good. Though they have sauces, the steaks are so good that you don't need any accompanying sauces. Service is top notch and they also have a bar area should you choose to have some drinks with your dining partner. Atmosphere is quiet and classy. A place for a special dinner. It's located at the Goodwood Park Hotel

The restaurant is on the ground floor of a beautiful colonial building that houses the iconic Goodwood Park Hotel. Crisp white table linens, attentive service and delicious platters served in a manner pleasing to the eyes too.The lunch sets allow you tasting portions of 2-3 choices of a 3-4 set lunch. This gets served promptly and you can easily finish within the hour.The cold angel hair pasta with caviar, mushroom cappucino, korubuta pork burger and the quail are recommended. End the meal with the delectable mango creme brulee

Living in Singapore, I am a regular diner at Gordon Grill. I usually have the set menu for lunch which offers a fantastic value! The set menu allows diners to have a taste of many of the restaurant's signature dishes. Diners get to choose 3 appetisers, 3 soups, 1 main course and 2 desserts. With the exception of the main course, the food is served in small tasting portions. It's delicious! The steaks are also good. There's a wide variety of cuts and cows. Various cuts of beef are presented on a trolley and the diners will chose how large a cut to have. I highly recommend a meal, especially lunch, at this restaurant

Excellent ambience and not crowded.Had lunch with a friend and the restaurant offers an environment for quiet chat.Staff is attentive and make good recommendation on your order; and would check if you are enjoying your lunch.Wine is served with your lunch order.We chose the business lunch menu at SGD38 for 3 courses.This included an appetizer, main course and dessert; skipping the soup item.My serving of steak was succulent and juicy. The bread basket had 3 different kinds of bread which are fresh and delicious.Desserts comes in small portions but they are exquisite.I would say that each dish is like a 'piece of art'; kudos on food presentation.A bit pricey for me for daily work lunch but good restaurant to revisit

When it comes to a bit above the crowd in food and excellent atmosphere for a serious business conversation, you can't beat the Gordon Grill. The business lunch menu is most reasonable at $38 for 3 courses and $48 for 4 courses. The special touch is that for most of the courses, one can choose small portions of 2-3 choices. For example, the appetizer, you may choose say the angel hair with crab meat and caviar or have it in smaller portion but pick 2 more among 4 or 5 appetizer selections. It comes in a long plate of 3 well laid out tasting portions. For people who want to nibble on morsels of interesting food while getting on with business, this is ideal. I skipped the soup (select among 3 choices) and went for the Tasmanian Baramundi for main and choice of 2 desserts to count as 3 courses altogether. All through lunch, the service was discreet yet attentive and we had an alcove to four of us. This added a sense of intimacy that was an asset to a client conversation

The Gordon Grill has been around for years and is still a good place to eat. Whilst you dont go to Singapore to eat Steak it is a place where you can get a good one.The Goodwood Park have given this restaurant a bit of a revamp

As a steak enthusiast, I appreciated this restaurant's sophisticated menu. It provided details on the steaks, such as grass fed vs corn fed, and the country of origin etc. Also, when we ordered steaks a waiter presented the raw meat on a cart, so that you can see the condition of the meat. Which is a great plus if you are as crazy about steaks as I am -- you could see the color, distribution of fat, and juiciness from looking at the raw meat yourself. The waiter then cut and weighed the meat in front of you before he takes the steak back to the kitchen for cooking. Unfortunately, I encountered snobbish and slightly rude service here. I asked for 300g of a certain cut of meat. The waiter cut the meat and put it on the scale, and it was 250g only. I then expressed discontent, saying that I had really wanted 300g. The waiter said, "Madam, most women order 200g only, so 250g is quite a big portion for you." I felt humiliated by this comment, and frankly surpised that a restaurant of this calibre -- which should have every incentive to sell more steak, not less, as the price is charged by unit of weight -- would give a female customer such treatment. But I was dining with business associates and did not want to make a scene, so I let it pass. Lastly I should mention that this restaurant has a British upper-class setting, is relatively quiet and forbids the use of mobile phones within the restaurant premises
