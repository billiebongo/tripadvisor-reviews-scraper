Warm friendly staff, delicious Pizzas, pasta, salads and more with the most stunning Bay front view, that's what Bazin gives you!
If and when in doubt about where to go, head to Bazin and you will never regret it!

We had a drink and snack before the light show at Marina Bay. It looked like a good selection of food on the menu, but we were more interested in liquids. After we finished we found our spot on the railing for the Light Show.
4
Came here for light snack, drink and dessert only after watching the musical fountain show. overall good experience.
4
Nice place with great view. Serves mostly European dishes and quick snacks. Service is very fast. Food is of good quality.
4
We had a great dining experience at Bazin recently. Ambiance was great. The view of the bay was mesmerising. Food was just super especially their thin crust pizzas.
We had a great time and would love to go back again.
5
Arrived here around 8.30pm on a Wednesday for dinner. Place was about half full. We were served promptly and food arrived quickly. Location was great and atmosphere was good. We just had 2 fresh juices and 2 basic mains and came to $87 but we enjoyed it all. Just felt this place did really well in all areas
4
Stopped here very late one evening for a bucket of cold beers, still really warm enough to sit outside in short sleeves at midnight. Relaxed atmosphere, no hassle from the staff even though we was last to leave. Beers are a lot cheaper elsewhere, but the view and ambience is worth the extra on this occasion
4
Lovely place overlooking the Bay, the lighting is nice and the venue feels very comfortable. The waitress was attentive and she took all our orders correctly.we were a group of eight ladies and we all ordered something different from the salmon to spaghetti and meet balls to olives and cheese, we were all pleased with our meals, but not overwhelmed. However we all felt the prices were reasonable. The service was good and all our foods came more or less together, which is very good for Singapore. My only gripe would be the bills were along time coming, and I had to ask twice before receiving it. Would recommend trying this venue ou

We always go there whenever we are at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. The staff is always wonderful and since we've been there so many times, they are really good in remembering your drinks and food. If you are there, please go and enjoy drinks sitting outside while watching the light show. Worth it
1
We were the only people in here at 12.30 pm on a Sunday afternoon. We only wanted a drink. Both Filipino waitresses were not interested in serving us at all. One was on her phone and the other was picking her nose!!. Eventually got a beer out of them for a ridiculous high price. Don't bothe
5
Phenomenal View .iT was Great place to spend some quality time with our Friends .
nice collection of drinks
good place ..
food is good ..
3
Came here for dinner and ordered a Hawaiian pizza. The taste is average and it's thin crusted. Cost $30 ++ for a 8 slice pizza. It's pricy....
4
- Great view at MBS
- Nice ambience, relaxing
- Beers in reasonable price
- Love their signature cocktails
3
~sometimes the air outside is hazy, but back in May it was a bright afternoon walk from the office to MBS with colleagues hungry for lunch~service starts with a we don't want walk in's attitude so a begging we gotta go and get seated where ever (I know I know, the place had zero guests when we arrived but the reservation system trumps whomever is already there always)~they did seat us so a consolation Beef Lasagne erm this tasted like a defrosted microwaved versionApple Crumble well I liked it enoughanytime service could have been better is when sometimes local folks should treat other local folks like customers, although this is prolly more of a bar hangout than a bistr
3
Ok ...ok. pizza ( meat lovers) was good ... nothing special... the prices ...6 sgd a small bottle of water ...same for Sprite and 33 sgd the pizza...ok again ..Marina bay... the worst ...waiters work as they are in the deep.hole of a mine in Papua.. do clients have to pay more for friendly ...smily staff ?? Both were no professional ( deliver wrong order to our table after 15 mn ).and no one smile !! Never again here sorry..
4
We had a convention in Marina Bay Sands and wanted to catch up with some of my colleagues. This place was a good choice as the MBS bars was always full and expensive. Bazin has a nice view of the bay and a fairly good selection of drinks and light food
2
Some of the worst service I've experienced in Singapore...and that's saying something! We sat for 30 minutes and were only asked if we wanted a drink as we summoned the staff. The waitress was unable to comprehend simple requests and, when the drinks order arrived, we had an extra beer and extra sprite which had not been ordered. The food itself was actually pretty good but the service means that I would not recommend this place to anyone
2
I know you are paying for the view and the location you expect the prices to be higher, but the food was not good. We ordered the nachos to start and to be honest it was like they had been warmed up in a microwave! Then we shared a pizza, it was very average. Pint of beer $16, again, because of the location, but of a tourist trap. The one positive was the staff, attentive and friendly, can't fault that, just a shame they are bringing out average food
5
View of the marina bag area was awesome, Very relaxing. The food was good as well but it's abit on the pricy side. Their pizzas are a must try and the Resturent is more crowded at night with it being packed daily. Do go early before the sun sets to get a table.
4
I went to a travel fair at MBS and then met my wife for lunch. Wanted to go up the towers but could not get a nice reserved table. Then saw the good deal that Bazin was offering for only $20. Some of the meals in the food court were already $19.90. The salad and pasta were very good and ice-cream was nice. The place has a nice ambiance as it overlooks the water and Singapore skyline
1
Food came out cold. It was obviously just microwaved freezer food.
Sent it back twice, staff were baffled. This is just a tourist trap.
5
Nice Restaurant to visit with friends & family. Drinks are nice (especially Singapore Sling) and food is good and fairly priced given the location. Staff is attentive especially the manager Kamal. Recommend it!
1
What can I say, bad service, bad hygiene levels, poor food and disengaged staff. What I don't understand in this prime location that you don't make anything more appealing out of it!
3
The location of Bazin is good to watch the crowds go by while enjoying a beer and a snack. As far as real food is concerned, I am not sure this would be a good option but for having a drink and some smaller bites it is fin
4
Stopped for an afternoon drink and snack after the gardens by the bay. The drinks were really good (singapore sling and a daiquiri), and the snacks were fresh and good. The location can't be beat. right on the promenade by Marina Sands. This place is cheaper than several others we visited on the bay, and the drinks better. Worth a stop if you are in the mood
4
A great place to sip a drink during the imperessive laser show.The laser show takes place twice every evening . I enjoyed my Singapore Sling watching the impressive laser display. Bazins also serves food. It is located outside the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall-Enjo
5
Situated right on Marina Bay, Bazin is a great place to stop for a meal and a drink. Their pizza's are really nice, and their drinks are nice and cold :-)Nothing is overpriced, a Singapore Sling (made properly I should say) is around $20...and some over places you could pay over $30!The staff are fantastic and very attentive and could not be more helpful. We will definitely be back
4
We stopped in for a couple of drinks after the light show in front of marina bay the service was very friendly and quick nice location and the Singapore slings where great a little bit expensive however that is normal for the area and alcohol in Singapore also remember the MRT is easy to use in Singapore
5
Bazin serves the best pizza and salmon. The thin crust pizza was so cheezy and yummy. Me and my friends had a good time. The staff were very attentive to our needs and from time to time come to our table and check how's everything. The restaurant's view is so amazing as you can see the full view of Singapore's skyscrapers. It was indeed a very good experience.
1
Arrived 9.30 looking for food as late union flight and nice location. All the items on menu I wanted were run out. Ended up with a pizza - they do not know what it should be like. Base fatty and more like a roti, little flavour and hardly any tomatoe. Service bad. They asked how food was, I told them and they walked off! Pizza was 32 Sing
4
Must try their Seafood pasta(pesto based), which is really tasty!
Had a pleasant dinner with a wonderful view.
A night to remember!
2
One of the places you pay for the view. I've had a pizza which tasted just like the frozen kind from dr Oetker, paid 30$ for that, beer 15$, ++ of course. Definitely not a place to visit again.
5
Nice place to chill. Excellent service by Mr kamal. The wagyu burger was strongly recommended by him, very tasty and juicy. On the tap Heineken and erdinger. The dessert is awesome. Thank you very much. Will recommend friend to go.
3
This place is great for a drink and some bar snacks. Happy hour from 5-8pm, it really clears out quickly after that. I thought their pizza was reasonable. They have Guinness on tap.
5
This place is right in front of the Marina Bay Light Show view. We booked a table before and went at the time of light show. Place is very busy and full of people, food is awesome. The Chicken Tikka/Tandoori Chicken Pizza is worth having.
3
If u want to just hang out, take your time & chil with some drink.
This could be the one of best choice.
Stay on the deck & see the night at Marina Bay.
So good!
3
Very disappointed in the lack of courtesy shown by the staff at this place and it wasn't even crowded. The staff's attitude was like they couldn't be bothered, as if they were doing us a favour.Food was fine. Good quantity, but again felt as if it had been prepared under pressure, not with any joy or pride in their work.At least they have options if you are vegetarian
3
This is one of those restaurants that are still open when most shops and restaurants inside the mall are closed. I had the Wagyu Burger and Tiger Beer. It was quite good but I don't really understand the menu concept of the place. It's got a very good view of the marina specially if you want to see the light show in the evening. I think this bistro is nice for having cocktails prior to diner or just a place to hang out if you want to enjoy the scenes around in the afternoon, maybe 4 pm when its getting cooler
3
Visited here last night and found the food delightful, it was very tasty and the food was reasonably priced for the location. The drinks I would say were overpriced the size of the cocktails for the price was disappointing. The location was nice and had a nice view, would recommend for the food, service was average, but the drinks were too expensive.
2
Sitting there right now. Ordered just a cola for starters, which is $6.50. Not upset about the price as it is a more luxurious place and on the boulevard. Waitress brings me a coaster from a guest who I just saw leaving. The coke arrives but has no bubbles. I return and tell there is no bubbles in it, waitress gives an answer that it is from the tap and shows the hose like in clubs to mix the drinks.. that's it, looks at me being upset. Finishing my drink and not my place to return to
3
We selected this restaurant due to its location near the Light Show. Whilst the food here was good we were disappointed with the slow service - place wasn't overly busy so expected slightly better service than we received.
3
Excellent location, near hotel Marina Bay sands. Nice to have a drink in the evening and enjoy the atmosphere. Nothing special in terms of food/drinks/service. Nothing wrong either.
5
simple but tasty food with a great location on Bay promenade where to enjoy the laser show displayed everyday at 8.00 pm

In my first exploration of an Asian country, my husband and I arrived at Singapore in a Saturday and I think there couldn't be a better day to do it. The first place we decided to explore was the area of Marina Bay Sands. And our first dinner in Singapore was at this very nice restaurant. We had no reservation and, as it was Saturday evening, you can imagine how sought-after the restaurants around this place were. Even so, we were friendly served and had a very good dinner, enjoying a nice view of the surroundings. As a ritual, we began with two Singapore Sling cocktails, of course! For main dish, we both ordered a salmon with curry and vegetables, very tasteful and spicy, but memorable. It was a very good start in Singapore! We enjoyed it and recommend
5
Bazin is a small restaurant at Marina Bay beside “The Promenade”. It is cozy and they keep the glass walls open towards “The Promenade” so that some of the tables even are outside. The view from the restaurant is fantastic. The Promenade with all the big palms and behind the water all the big skyscrapers illuminated in the evening. This is the perfect place to sit with a glass of beer or wine and some snacks and watch the music and laser show in the evening. Not too expensive and surely worth the mone
3
Located right on the waterfront in Singapore, Bazin restaurant offers icy cold beer and wine to have as you watch the yachts sail by! The food was good, with offerings such as nachos, dip plates etc. Drink prices were average by Singapore standards. Great way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon. Good for people watching too
4
We had a pleasant casual meal here. Great spot to see the laser show at 8pm - we ordered our meal prior and asked that it be served after the show so we could get up and watch from an even closer spot. Staff were helpful, meal nice and a great spot to show overseas guests the Marina Bay area at night
3
If you go, try to be there early for happy hour. We missed it by 15 minutes while watching the water light show. The shrimp appetizer was excellent, nachos ok and beer met the need of wet and cold. Nice views but pricy at $40/person for just a been and app
5
My wife and I dropped in on a whim last night to watch the light show. We started with pre-dinner drinks and watched the show before moving inside for a meal. We were one of three tables. We had just sat down when a large group arrived. The wait staff hopped to and quickly re-arranged seating before immediately taking our order to avoid the rush. Our food arrived in a timely fashion and was well presented. I had Black Angus steak cooked to perfection as were the roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. The mushroom sauce was slick and perfect. My wife's Hawaiian pizza was thin crust/crispy. A rear meal. One must be aware of Singapore wine prices and be prepared to take the hit. All in all a memorable night with attentive and personable staff. Oh, by the way, the view wasn't bad either
3
Went to this restaurant with my siblings in 2013. Ordered a couple of beers. Two great things about this place, it had plenty of seating and the view was good. Staff seemed uninterested in working, like as though they despised their job. Expensive but what do you expect from this island
1
We chose to eat at this place in hope of a half decent view of the esplanade, and the menu looked ok. Unfortunately there is nothing decent about this place at all.The staff are uninterested and rather rude, and left us waiting to be seated for a long time, instead choosing to have a conversation with each other and ignoring us completely. When they did finally get round to seating us, they put us next to a concrete wall at the back of the small resturant right by the kitchen. We asked to be moved as the resturant wasn't even that busy (and isn't this why they charge you such ridiculous prices for the food?)We ordered some garlic bread to start which was like a low standard pub quality, and for mains got the spring chicken and the truffle pizza. When we initially ordered, my husband changed his mind about one minute later as there was a few ingredients on it he didn't like, and we asked to change it. The staff member we dealt with refused to change it even though it was literally one minute later which was very unfair.When the food arrived it was of rubbish quality, the chicken was all bones with barely any meat on it and the pizza was was very average, yet they charge you a fortune as though it was a fancy eatery. We heard a complaint from another table about the food and I can't say I'm surprised as they just don't care and are solely trading off the location. It is so frustrating too that you have to pay a service charge despite the terrible service.In summary, don't waste your money here, there are cheaper places within the shopping centre that do better quality food than this, these people don't deserve your business
4
Had set up a gathering dinner for my team. The food and set up was good. Reasonable price. The smokey chicken pizza and Bazin's platter was great! This was second time and first time tasted this. The only area need improvement would be the restaurant atmosphere. Can't hear any soft music. Not so relax. Suggest to have some activities and work on promotion. One thing for sure, the overall service was good. Keep this up

I had dinner last week and walked outside Marina Bay sands. Most of the restaurants in the mall are way to expensive but decided to go here for the view over the harbour. The waiter on the street was friemdly and convinced me. I had a pizza, salad, coffe and some wine of a average quality and do not know how they did it but I had to pay over a 100 S dollar and feel this was way over the top.
5
Was here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary recently and it was great dining experience and amazing service.My wife had spring chicken and she said it was so tender and juicy and I had tenderloin steak, which was perfectly done and was my best meal since long.Spring chicken was recommended by the service staff. During our meal waitress came to our table and asking if we enjoying the meal. After we finished the meal, we ordered Bazin Fondant to share and we like it so much. After i asked for the bill, staff brought the bill and told us Bazin Fondant is on the house, this is your anniversary treat. We were so happy with the food and amazing service. I would strongly recommended this restaurant
5
I had dinner with my Family on 20th August,We were sharing seafood Linguine, Lima cheese pizza, garlic prawn, spring chicken. Thin crust pizza with generous portion of cheese honestly one of the best pizza in Singapore. Service was great and staffs were very friendly. I would definitely visit Bazin again
1
Went here for lunch recently and it was truly one of the worst places I've eaten at. We felt like some pasta, so tempted by the menu, we went in. Despite the restaurant being empty at 12:30pm on a weekend (that's telling you something), they stuck us near a concrete pillar then wouldn't move the partially open sliding doors which we folded up in front of our table (so I had to get up and move them myself). Ordered the creamy pork linguine which quite frankly, was awful. Three slices of mushroom and bacon in a greasy sauce. I was starving but even then couldn't get through it. The kids meal was not much better - no wonder my 3 year old refused to eat it. Plus a couple of fruit drinks that weren't even fully filled up to the top of the glass. But the biggest insult was the bill - 2 mains, 1 kids meal, 2 non-alcoholic drinks = $94! I don't mind paying high prices for something good, but not this. I wish I read these reviews first, because it doesn't sound like this is an isolated experience
1
There is a great view of the bay and its light show here, I'm guessing this is the only reason they are still in business. The food is disgusting, I had a creamy pork linguine which translated to oil and bacon, it was inedible. My husband had a pizza, he said it was on par with Pizza Hut. The service was the worst I've had in Singapore, rude, arrogant and dismissive. Reading other reviews it is obvious that others had a similar experience, hopefully they will go out of business soon and stop marring the Singapore food scene.
1
The food here is absolutely disgusting. I had their wagyu beef burger, which in all honesty, made me wish I'd gone to macdonalds instead. The beef was dry and hard, and when it reached me it was cold. It came with fries, which I suspect might have been truffle fries, but then again, I really couldn't tell. They weren't fries, they were crisps. There wasn't even a tiny sliver of potato left anywhere in those things. Don't eat here at all costs. Go have a Big Mac instead or something
4
Bazin is a small bar located next to Marina Bay and has an absolutely fabulous view of the city. Small selection of wine, service was good, food is decent but the location is the main attraction here. You can watch the nightly water/light show as well. For a nice, relaxing drink while soaking up the beautiful Singapore, this is the place

BAZIN Casual DiningMy friends and I hunted around Marina Bay Sands Shoppes for a bite after watching an afternoon show (Le Noir). After looking at menus from 5 different restaurants we decided to try out Bazin, the Euro-oriental bar and restaurant at L1-B4, Bay Level. You can choose to sit outside and do some people watching while you enjoy beer from the tap or bottle. If you prefer a more intimate space, you may prefer to go into the dining area.We were hungry so we chose to skip the cocktails and attack the menu. The dining area inside is air-conditioned (but not fully enclosed) and you can escape the Singapore heat while you savor the restaurant’s offerings.We started the meal with a plate of mixed sausages, the perfect complement to the various beers available. I got myself an Erdinger while my friends ordered Heinekens and a Stella Artois. We ordered the chef’s recommendation Tartufo Pizza, a thin crust 12inch pizza which was surprisingly very good with or without the tabasco sauce. The spring chicken (whole) was very tender and juicy, and came covered with a mildly spicy orange sauce. The bowl of tortilla chips with salsa and sour cream dip was so-so, but my friends loved the sour cream. Overall, the experience was very satisfying. The place was cozy, the food delicious with servings well proportioned and well timed. The beers were served with a good amount of head (except for the Stella which came in a chilled bottle). We felt the prices were fairly decent. Perhaps the only recommendation for the restaurant I can make is for them to get a pizza stand for the table as their wooden pizza serving plate takes more than 2/3 of the table space
2
..but the food is pretty poor, with a badly put together menu, and flavours overpowered by the too many spices and garlic. With so much other choice in Singapore, this is a definite miss.
4
At the waterfront with an open air terrace, this place serves decent food at great prices. From the terrace you have a great view of the daily water and light show in the evening.
4
Absolutely fantastic location on Marina Bay, and THE place to watch the light show.
The food is good, with a wide selection of different dishes. Can feel a bit 'alone' eating as many people stay just for drinks.

Getting There: Bayfront Mrt station and walk towards Eventplaza. Turn right corner and you won’t miss this restaurant. Landmark, opposite Louis Vuitton Flagship store at Crystal Pavilion.Ambience of Restaurant: it’s pretty basic, with table settings out on the terrace too. The tables, furniture’s, walls & floors are all having scratch marks and dirt. If you are looking for something perfect, drop your idea at this place. Lightings are plain and music is pain. Service Level: The waiter who took our orders had poor command of English language, neither could he understand simple English, nor he interpreted any orders correctly, for any change to the food recipe, he couldn’t decide but simply said cannot or choose to ignore it. We were very hungry, so decided to get our drinks later and when conveyed it to him, he kind of smirked letting us think, we are two jesters from hawker market expecting same from a classy restaurant. Actually hawker market service is a class, locals can agree for sure! Money for Food: Once we dismissed the Waiter, there was a TURNAROUND; the assistant manager of the restaurant came to our table. Cool guy, who handled our queries professionally. Suggested and changed our course of meal to what we wanted.Our Menu: Pizza (Chicken) & Chicken Grilled, Chicken Wings (Texas Sauce), too spicy so ask for making normal wings with Texas sauce on a cup to be used.Food Quality: The quality of the food is good. When i say quality, it means it is fresh; you don’t feeling biting a log that has made its way to the kitchen and ending up on your plate, especially if you have meat on the menu.Taste: The Pizza was done right on very thin crust, almost like paper, yet didn’t break but was super soft. Every slice was having a piece of chicken and nothing, no veggies, not even cheese that you can feel. Don’t know, if other choice of pizza would be something different. The Grilled chicken lived up to the mark, and was quite good, but be sure to ask for some add ones, like coleslaw or French fries, cause we didn’t and later came to know it comes with choices as side dishes. The Chicken wings was also quite good, especially when we dipped it in the Texan sauce, it was nice.Drinks: Singapore Sling is famous all over Singapore and the real owner is raffles hotel. So we tried it here and it was quite good. Had another cocktail with rock melons and combo which was not bad.Note: Most people think Wonderful show is great from this location, but it’s quite not exactly, you will be blocked by rows of palm trees and moving crowd and you cannot enjoy the show from this restaurant.Price: Expensive as per restaurant standards, but price don’t match up to the offering sizes, neither ambience nor poor service levels. If you don’t ask for the manager, you are getting less attention and on top this, they say you got to reserve tables. Mind-blowing!!Verdict: If you are keen on authentic pizza's head down to Italian wood fire pizza at bukitimah road. I feel the management should wake up and realize about the service levels. If service is great, other things are more or less overlooked, but sadly it doesn’t at this place. It’s a strict no second time for us. It’s just BASIC
2
Ordered Pizza. Came out in reasonable time and was not a bad feed. Staff not attentive at all, and could not take a drinks order. They got both wrong and had to be returned. I guessing thats why the drinks are so expensive. View of the Marina is magic, especially at night and the good location underneath tne Marina Bay Sands Resort. Howeveer I would try my luck at another restaurant
1
Granted it was a tough evening because of the free concert on the pier, but during the course of our evening we were seated at a table then reseated because the table was apparently taken by someone else (?), reseated again because the table we ended up at had water dripping down on my fellow diners. Once dinner arrived, one of our party was not served and only much later did we find out the food he ordered was not available. Food was ok, but the service was absolutely awful. The manager apologized to us, but we are not interested in going back. Many other options in Singapore, so I am staying away
2
I have been to thousands of restaurants all over the world and I believe I have enough taste to make these comments. My wife made the reservation to watch the lightshow while having dinner but I will honestly say that both was a real waste of time and the rwstaurant was waste of taste. In spite of low quality food the waiters were really unpolite. It took very long almost an hour to bring our food. My choice was four cheese pizza but I have never eaten such type of four cheese pizza. Dont waste your taste here...
2
We sat down and asked for an apertif...the wairess pushed me to a pint of beer....no a bottle is fine I said..ohhh no local beer in bottles...only imported at 14$....my wife asked for a still water -- out came 'FIJI WATER' at 8$ a small bottle.....we looked at the menu and left paying 17.70 for a bottle of water and a small glass of beer
4
We had dinner at Bazin a few weeks ago and the experience was Fabulous!Staff were very welcoming.The food was just superb especially their green curry pizza! Yes, it may sound 'alien' to most but the taste was just so good.Winelist is great and of good value.Since, we're seated at the alfresco area, we had a perfect view of the lights and fountain show which I believe is a plus, as they're the only restaurant along the stretch that has a clear view of the show.It was close to perfection! We had a great evening and would definitely recommend it to everyone who wants an amazing dining experience
2
Had it not been for business associates wanting a western meal in Singapore, I would likely never have visited. The views are spectacular, particularly at night with the light shows. However, the food and service is uninspiring and over priced. Much better options exist in a city known for its spectacular food options
