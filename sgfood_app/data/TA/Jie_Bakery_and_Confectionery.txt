Only a few of these shops are left in Singapore! The aroma of freshly baked loafs are simply to-die-for! The loafs here are average price but you can be sure that they're fresh from the oven! A spread of homemade kaya and butter come at an additional cost

The two loaves of bread cost about $5.80, but definitely we thought it was worth the price. These are one of the very few traditional bakeries you can find in Singapore which still retain the taste of traditional bread as compared to Japanese or European-style bakeries sprouting up in busy crowd. If you are also a fan of traditional bread, your trip will not be wasted. Furthermore, if you happened to visit the bakery in the noon, you might just be in time to taste another traditional food - Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint, a duck specialist shop right beside it
