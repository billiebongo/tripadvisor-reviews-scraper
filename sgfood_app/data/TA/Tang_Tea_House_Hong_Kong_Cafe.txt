Lo Mai Kai was shockingly small. And it cost 3.90, I'm out. Food are also generally overpriced, but other than the Lo Mai Kai everything taste okay.

Im always there with my family for dinner. Food served such as Tom Yum Soup,Kailan belachan,Seafood Hor Fun etc are awesome. The waiting time are ok..and the price are moderate. No wonder it's always packed with people almost every evening.

(-) the table arrangements are too cramp and squeezy
Those who bring kids, they provide baby high chair. But there is no special menu of kids.

Great dumpling always. Pan fried dumpling. I come here mostly for this all the time. There's steamed ones too which is alright. But please eat it while it's hot to taste the great flavours.I will order a drink of cooling what's that... green colour.. ahh.. cooling lemongrass. Really nice. Just let them know you want less sugar if you don't wish for it to be very sweet

Wow, first time been to this area " Jalan Kayu". Many Malay or Halal food store here. I would say Tang Tea House is one of the restaurant I will definately come back again. I tried the promotion curry fish head and was so delicious although not as many vegetables inside the pot. However, the fish head with many fish meat. Gravy was amazing and spicy enough for me

Huge menu, with many rice, noodles, soup and dishes options. Overall quality if good, the crispy beehoon is very crispy, kampung fried rice taste good with huge serving and new goreng is tasty too. But nasi lemak and chicken rice is average and quite pricey. Good lunch place with a lot choice and halal, although price at high side.

This is by far the best place to get Golden Sand Buns or Salted egg Yolk Buns. I love this place to the core. Although its a bit too far for me and my family we are willing to travel. Its open 24 hours so you can eat as and when you want and there are also public transport if youre heading there before 11pm. Service is good. Food is excellent. Especially the Opeh!! A bit expensive but totally wortg the money

This review is based on the visit I made most recently, which also happens to be the first time I've eaten here. I shared four dishes with my boyfriend. The sambal seafood hotplate, pineapple fried rice, tom yum soup and prawn paste roll. Unfortunately 3/4 of the dishes were very disappointing. The food came out fairly quickly, there were lots of other customers both inside and outside and the service was good. Staff were attentive and always looking out. Drinks were good and quite standard in flavor but the dishes we ordered were a let down. The tom yum soup tasted exactly like a pre made tom yum soup that wasn't diluted enough, it was very thick and too sweet with not much seafood or ingredients inside. It really needed more sour to balance out the sweetness.The pineapple fried rice was below average, a bit too wet, not enough pineapples and tasted just like normal fried rice but that was okay with us. The biggest let down was the seafood sambal on hotplate...it big slices of onion, spring onion and tomato were completely raw, a hot plate dish like this should have those ingredients sauteed at least. There were two prawns which looked crispy but were very soggy, a few pieces of soggy dory and instead of using normal fresh or frozen raw squid, they used cured squid. The cured squid was really not what we would expect for this kind of dish.Lastly the sambal sauce for the dish was also very obviously premade sambal that hasn't been diluted or had anything else additional added or mixed in! Just straight up super cloying, super sweet and nothing like a normal sambal. Add together the lack of quality in the ingredients, the sauces that were not adjusted and the raw vegetables throw in raw and not even cooked first, this dish was just sad.The saving grace was the fried prawn paste rolls which were absolutely delicious. The total for the fours dishes and two drinks was about $41 and I still can't believe how terrible the soup and seafood sambal was...I've eaten far more authentic sambal dishes and tom yom for the same price or cheaper around singapore so this was a let down. Given that this place has a HUGE menu and a lot of people were enjoying the chinese dishes, the dim sum items and more but I base this review on my experience and what I ate and unfortunately it wasn't worth my time or money

Has a wide range of dim sum and local halal food prepared in Chinese fashion.....customers should try the salted egg bun and lots of other dishes there....the staff is very attentive and prompt....can pay via variousmode like Nets, cash, credit card...a decent place to have a meal with the family and friends...
