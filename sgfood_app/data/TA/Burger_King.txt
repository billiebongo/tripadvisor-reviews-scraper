Decent burger and fries but a long queue and wait to be served, coffee was very good and the place clean and tidy.

Yes, it is a junk food. But, I never miss Burger King in Singapore. Why? I tried BK in several places and country, but I think the BK in Singapore is the best.

While going around Singapore, @Raffles actually, we found a Burger King, and for a change (we've been having rice for 4days already) we decided a burger for a change, and it was great! Especialliy their mew spicy burger and fries.

They just need more staff to clean the place.
It was messy. Empty trays in every table.
But, 2 staff in the counter was friendly and quick.

We happened to go shopping at Bugs village when we felt hungry and thus went to Burger king. There are no vegetarian options at all. The only thing we could have were ice creams and cold coffee which were yummy and worth the price. It's a small and congested outlet. The cleanliness part is absolutely missing!

Been there numerous times as my clinic is just around the corner. BUT ever since my last visit 3 weeks ago...THAT'S IT. The counter staffs are rude..never smiling..rushing through your orders...gets very easily agitated and impatient when customers enquire further. Kitchen staff prepares food just for the sake of clearing the crowd. Managers on duty don't seem to bother or assist especially during peak periods and especially so when a complain is brought to their attention, they will simply brush it off quickly and to the verge of protecting their staff even though is evidently their fault..whats happening?? I would advise tourists NOT to go there not if unless you wish to have your mood ruined by group of incompetent staff. There are more choices along that stretch of walkway...JINJJA CHICKEN is the new kid on the block and the queue is mad house! Decided to give it a try and no regrets

After shopping we decided to eat at Burger King, we were waiting for our other family members who were still buying items on Bugis Street, I was surprised when one member of the staff headed to our area and told us that we should order or else we cannot stay on the property. I was shocked because it was the first time that I stayed on a Burger King property who does that to their customers! and one more thing we were bringing some other food from the outside which are inside the plastic bags so we can take it back to our Hotel but one of their staff went back again and told us we cannot eat outside food inside Burger King.. Hello?! as if we are going to eat those there.. I was really disappointed with the service. We ate there even if it was thrice the amount of Burger King on my Country. Good Food because they have a different menu compared to what Burger King serve in the Philippines but customer service should really be improved

Burger King is fairly consistent in most Countries I've visited, but I tried two in Singapore and was really disappointed. The beef pattie was covered in some stodgy goo, supposed to be 'a local favourite' I was told, and there was an air of indifference in the staff. Found McDonalds to be far superior in both food and service
