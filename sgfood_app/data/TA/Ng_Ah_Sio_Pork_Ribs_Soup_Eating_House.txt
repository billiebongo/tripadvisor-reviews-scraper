This is our favourite Bakuteh restaurant. My family went there twice in the last two months because we liked the peppery pork ribs soup and the many side dishes such as yu tiao, intestines, braised pig trotters. Parking was easy along the main road.
4
Everyone should try Ng Ah Sio, I really really like it üëçüèª Pork was tender and soup was really delicious. I also had Luo Han Tea, which is not my favourite (because it was sweeter than I expected).
4
My number 2 pick for the best bakuteh in Singapore. 1st pick is the 365 Balestier Bakuteh. The porky soup is delicious. However the pork is not tender as 365 or even Songfa.

I ate this Ba kut Teh at Sentosa Island. I'm not a fan of Ba Kut Teh but I quite like this Ba Kut Teh specially after doing all the activities in Adventure cove Waterpark it's satisfied my hunger. My friends who likes Ba Kut Teh also said it's delicious. The waiter in the Sentosa Island restaurant is also nice. Overall is a nice restaurant

Personally I do loved Bakut Teh with peppery soup, and found this place match with my taste. During my hunt to search for Bakut Teh, this is the best so far.Meat was so tender and juicy. The soup was able to be refilled as much as you want. It's worthed to eat here and surely will be back for more
3
To be fair, the food was good. The soup is more towards the peppery side and for those who love it to be strong, this is a place for you. Side dishes are the same like other bak kut teh outlets available in Singapore. Overall we do enjoy the food there but if you are wanting to be there close to their closing time, i highly dun recommend to go. There was one male kitchen staff or perhaps cleaner who came to us and ask us whether we are done as he wants to clean our table and lament that they are closing. His tone was not nice and his face is giving us the "Please leave as soon as you can" as he was standing around our table. This is what kills off returning guest so i'm boycotting this particular branch at Rangoon. It's not easy to find also as it's quite far in. Good luck

Have been eating at this restaurant for a long time but have not been back for quite a while. Decided to go back on the weekend. The soup is still good as I have expected which with the You tiao. At the end, always good to go with Kung Fu tea! BRTon

The Bak Kut Teh is very fresh and no strong smell. The veges are very good as well. The only thing is the pepper smell too strong, my cousin kids don't like becoz it's too spicy for them. Unlike Malaysia Bak Kut Teh becuase the soup only content meat and garlic. Yes, no mushroom nor toukee.I have bring my China cousin to this shop and I can't wait to bring them to try Bukit Mertajam Taste :

Review by Dr Sim. Very good Pork Rib Soup. Very peppery. Ambience is basic. No air-conditioner. Very famous people (actors, politicians) have patronize the outlet. Their photos are on the wall. Good for tourists to eat there for lunch. A bit warm but you get a feel of the old Singapore. Try the steamed squid as well. Regard Dr Si

Bak-kut-teh is a pork rib dish cooked in broth popularly served in Malaysia and Singapore, & it has been very amongst the Hoklo and Teochew community. Of course, there is a slight different in term ingredients and therefore taste of Bak Kut Teh from Singapore to that of Malaysia. It was the staple diet of substance in the morning back in the colonial days of the bygone era of the British Empire when these Chinese workers came to Malaysia & Singapore as coolies. Bak Tuk Teh has been kept up with time & able to stay updated with the growing affluence of Malaysia & Singapore, & modern days' preference for leaner & better quality of Pork Ribs. This place only opens for lunch & it has become very famous regionally when the 1st Chief Executive Officer of HKG SAR came to S'pore for an official visit and asked for a special dinner arrangement for the entourage, Mr Tung's request was refused! They dont open for dinner for anyone
4
Best ba kut teh in town simply for the peppery soup based, thick meaty broth. A favorite weekend meal for the family.
3
One bowl of youtiao per person is a must. Pig trotters and tofu are fantastic! First serving of soup was blend, only the top-up was better. Too peppery for my liking.
3
I tried this few years ago, the pepper taste of the soup is heavier compared with founder pork soup, but more expensive and few meat (and this is not soft enough). You may try once.
4
Ordered a variety of dishes and they arrived swiftly.
Quality of food is quite good except that the pork ribs were slightly over cooked.
Soup base was the highlight, peppery and flavorsome. Staff refilled without prompting.
3
Nowadays bak kut teh has become more and more expensive due to the popularity among tourists. This restaurant is located in Rangoon road, it does not have any aircon, so it will be a bit hot. We have ordered and while everything is being served, they forgotten our pork ribs soup. The portion is small and topping up of soup is slow, soup is also spicy as compared to other restaurant
1
Family of 4 visited ng ah sio sentosa last night and we had an unpleasant experience. We ordered 3 sets instead of 4 cos we won't be able to finish 4 sets. We were only allowed 3 trays despite asking for additional tray due to the design of the table. It was difficult to balance our rice bowls on the tracks !!!I understand the policy of tray returned n deposit of $1 and I am willing to put $1 for the additional tray due to the design of the table but was denied Please spare some thoughts for your customers
4
When my friends ask me to join them to this restaurant, I'm not really insterested since bakut teh is not my type of meal. But after I try those pork ribs soup in this Resto, well.... I have to revise my culinary List. The soup is so good, very well seasoned, the ribs is not "smelly" like most pork cuisine and very tender.
5
My ex-Boss took me here more than 7 years ago. It's been my favorite bakut teh in singapore and always will. During this visit, the taxi driver sway us to try the Legendary Bakut Teh. He mocked us because we coming to Ng Ah Sio, saying bad things. After taste the Legend Bakut Teh and disappointed, we walk to Ng Ah Sio and once again felt satisfied. You MUST TR

This is a place for the best bakut teh pork ribs. If you like bakut teh which have strong taste like pepper with ingridient bakut teh soup, this is the place. If u come from outside singapore and bakut teh lover, it's a must place to come. I also loved small n big Intestines, quit good too.Place can only be reach with mrt go to farrer park station and walk 500m or by taxi. Price is quite expensive for bakut teh in Singapore but it's worth to try for once. Also this place has no Air Con so if u have lunch with hot weather and hot soup, u will be sweating. They provide a lot of fan but for me it's not a problem at all. But if don't like to eat and sweating. U should consider before u come. I will always come back to this place, everytime i go to singapore

My family and I went to the branch at Sentosa at the Festive Walk. We were greeted by three self-ordering machines which were luckily user-friendly and easy to order.Instructions were not clear though so I left the receipts hanging after payment. Sitting for a while only to realise I needed the receipt to collect orders. Stupid me! The tables were crafted specially for self-service restaurants and we ate with a tray each. Each tray returned will also refund a SGD1 each. Price is not too bad but the bah kut teh cannot compare to those in Malaysia. The bah kut teh soup was too peppery, taste like pork pepper soup, unlike herbal soup. However the braised trotter was good. The meat was soft, easily comes off at a prick of the chopsticks and the braise sauce was good enough. A set with pork ribs bak kut teh, braised trotter and a little bowl of preserved vegetable plus a rive was SGD18.80, the set is good for two persons or even three for a breakfast (with additional rice)Overall we are satisfied but lack that bak kut teh "kick"
3
The pork ribs here are ok. Except I prefer the herbal soup rather than the pepper version which is served here.
4
Spicy awesome pork ribs. U can add ur own 'small chilli' as well as garlic to start the engine going. Careful with the portion, it can make you hungry as well as have a tearful ending. Definitely will return for another round.
4
A lot of ppl said this place serves very good bak kut teh (local pork rib soup). Test and tried on 2 occasions. A good choice, but not surprisingly delighted. Thick broth, good fresh meat and liver... Clean and bright though.
4
Super tasty bak kut teh with refilled soup. Other compliment dishes are also very well executed especially the blanch vegetables, tofu. I do like Chinese fried dough when dip into the soup. Ambience is nice & clean. highly recommend!
3
Was here for dinner this evening. Though we ordered most dishes to try. Taste so so, soup not hot and diluted. Not flavorful, soup not hot. Not worth going again.
4
We chose to have lunch here, since it's very convenient to the aquarium, which we had just visited, and we wanted some true local food. This is comparable to a fast food restaurant in the US, but you choose what you want to eat at the entrance, pay for it in a machine, and pick it up with a tray, and when you return your tray, you get S$1 back. We had pork in a delicious broth. It was a quick, easy, and tasty lunch
5
I've tried many pork fib soup restaurants and according to my experience Ng Ah Sio is so far the best in taste, freshness of the food and the ambient to have such kind of food. Song Fa and the Founder need to visit this shop and find out the difference. It's not much but THERE IS A DIFFRRENCE.
4
So this location is close to the Newton Food Centre and is very clean. There are many locations for this chain and is among one of the most famous Bak-Kut-Tehs (pork rib soup) in Singapore.Their version is more teochew (chiu chow style, on the eastern side of Guangdong province) which is more peppery as compared to the Malay style or Hokkien style which is much more herbal and darker in the broth.The tern "teh" which is teochew for tea is kind of a misnomer nowadays (perhaps the origin of it did use tea leaf), the modern version is really a broth.We tried different dishes they were quite good but my opinion is there are many places in Singapore that can dish out the Bak-kut-teh just as good
3
A friend took us for a brunch to this restaurant, he said here was the best Ba-kut-teh (pork ribs soup). The resto was an old style Chinese resto, the service was fast. A bowl of ba-kut-teh and additional rice and vegetables could be ordered. The soup was good taste and the meat was soft. This resto has been operated for generations, A nice place to have meal with friends
2
We had the set meal, about SG$15. It comes with a bowl of pork ribs in soup, a bowl of steamed peanuts and fried tofu in soy sauce, some yu tiao and a bowl of rice. How good is it? Well, this is a substantial meal, given the price and the venue (I was at the Sentosa branch). However, the measure of a good bak kut teh (meat bone tea) is in the soup. The spices that make the soup is what makes the dish. Maybe it is my unsophisticated palate speaking here but the pappery taste overwhelmed the other spice that may have made up the soup. To me, this is a paper and pork rib soup with a dash of soy. Disappointing for some who like their bak kut teh with the traditional taste.And they also charge a deposit for the tray, which you will need to eat from as the tables were purposely made wonky so bowls cannot sit right on them. This is not a problem, unless you share your meal with someone, then you are one tray short. You get your dollar deposit back when you return the tray. I return trays at hawker stores as a matter of course and I am sure you do the same at McDonald's. In Singaporean food courts,your trays and dirty bowls are taken away by cleaners right after you finished eating. By charging a deposit for the tray, this store is saying they are not providing you with the kind of service you can expect in food courts. Super disappointing
5
Nice place for local Bak Kut Teh. Like the peppery broth and the well cooked meat. I always get their veggie bowl as well.
4
Service is fast and soup is very peppery as compared to other pork ribs soup. Portion is reasonable.
5
The soup containing alot of white pepper, this is the typically singapore bakutteh ( porkribs soup), they will serve with the tender pork ribs, normal 2 slave. And the also have other menus like soya sauce egg, tofu, and some vegetables.
4
We ate here for lunch.They have strong taste, original recipe for Bakut teh compared to other restaurants.We ordered quite a lot of varians and I like them all!!!A must place to go when you come to Singapore.Here are some of the pictures..
4
I ordered a plate of preserved vegetables, a plate of steamed sotong, a bowl of mee suay and a cup of drink. The food and soup base is pretty tasty. I like the taste of the chilli and blend well with the food. Visited during non-peak hour and the services is good too
4
Previously made by a old uncle who has since sold the business to the big jumbo seafood restaurant chain. .The bak kut teh is the peppery soup type and it's very peppery. So if you can't take pepper this is not the place for youThe spare ribs is only 2 pieces for a small bowl but the soup is refillable as many times as you wantYou can order other accompanying dishes like intestines, cha kueh, peanuts, vegetables etcTo get here take the north east line to farrer park mrt and look for exit I to city Square mall. Once out onto the main street turn right and start walking. It's about a 10-15mins walk
4
Always love the pork ribs soup here. Love the peppery soup, and that we can ask for soup refill. Dont order the long ribs, but the signature pork ribs as it is easier to eat for me. I ordered the fried yutiao as usual, but this time taste a bit too oily. Anyway, always love to come bac

I seldom write a thoroughly bad review as people are also running a business, but I pride myself on giving an honest review as much as possible. This place used to be wonderful to come with the family and overseas friends with good bak kut teh soup that is deep and rich in taste and you can feel the time taken to boil the flavourful soup, same goes for the juicy pork ribs. That time has passed, and the commercialization of this place has turned its ugly head away from quality.The soup tastes like hot water, with barely a hint of the deep flavour of a long boil, the pork ribs are overcooked and taste even drier than the meat used when preparing Cantonese soup (which most throw away as the essence of the meat was used to make the soup and not complement it). It is one of the most unpleasant bak kut teh I have ever eaten, a far cry from several years ago. It tastes even worse than some of the instant packs that I bought and made at home myself from the supermarket. The garlicky content are also sparse and makes the flavour even weaker. That is not all, even the side dishes are deplorable, the intestines and salted vegetables are not seasoned and prepared as well as before, the soya sauce cooked with the intestines are not done long enough for the flavour to be soaked in and you end up tasting the plain intestines and soya sauce in two distinct tastes, the salted vegetables also lack a lot in taste.Their service was never good, with grumpy service staff, but least the food was good at that time. Now, this is just an embarrassment to bring my overseas guests to, and a total waste of time and money to make your way here anymore. I hate to sound mean which I rarely do, but I think my readers deserve to use their precious travel time to more worthy establishments
1
Visited this location and have business lunch . This place used to be the must eat location many years ago. Now the soup is blend and the meaty taste is no more. Service used to be fast and good, now I can only give a So so for service and quality of food. They have change management of the outlet and not too impress

I've been reading many rave reviews about this place before so I have quite high expectation on this place, especially that I brought two of my traveling buddies here. We were on budgeted trip so we decided to share everything, including food. We ordered one bowl of Signature Spare and Pork Ribs Combo Soup with a bowl of Braised Pig's Intestines and Kung Fu Tea for share.The soup has a little bit dark color but not the kind like Malaysian Bak Kut Teh that's using more herbs. It is very peppery, which I actually don't mind because I do love pepper. But I found that the ribs were quite plain in taste. And for the soup, aside for being peppery, it didn't taste as great as I expected. I've tasted one which was better somewhere else in Singapore back then.Surprisingly, the braised pig's intestines tasted really nice. It was seasoned better than the pork ribs.The price for us is a bit too pricey. But the good thing is we can ask to refill the soup as much as we want without being extra charged. And we came there in a rainy morning, so, it was good to have it in such weather.The location was by the main road so very easy to spot; the interior was spacious and brightly lit.√Ç
4
My first time in this place, the soup was great and the veal ribs so tender and tasty. I will come back for sure, is a great discovery.
4
Awesome Bak Kuh Teh! Peppery and flavoursome. This would be the most fantastic soup to drink on a cold winter's day as it will definitely warm you up. Still good to have once in a while in Singapore.
3
Free pepper on the soup
Unlimited filling of the soup if you can finish all
Local taste bud
Not easy on the taste bud and pocket
4
There are 3 Bak Kut Teh establishment in Rangoon Road vicinity. This is my preferred because of the unusual peppery soup compared to the normal soup base at most BKT shops. Tender meat that has been cooked for hours comes out of the ribs without effort with less fat. Refillable soup to fill my occasional demand for BKT. But the side dishes lack the quality from earlier times I visited this place. Preserved vegetable that is hard, soft peanuts that look like they came straight out of tin cans. Also must say that the later in the day you visit the shop the more bland and less fiery the soup taste. Make it a point to come before the lunch crowd gathers. After this peppery meal head over two-doors away to Non Entree for some cooling dessert to complete your meal with coffee/tea, ice cream and cakes. Cheers
3
One of the most well know bak kut teh establishment in Singapore but not my best as I felt the taste has too much pepper. However the tenderness of the ribs is what I will go for.It has also a good selection of side dishes to accompany the meal
4
This shop serves wonderful pork ribs in peppery herbal soup still piping hot. Other small dishes are pork knuckle, intestine, tripe & tofu, liver, hard boiled eggs and vegetables. Eat together with chopped garlic, chilli & dark soy sauce and a pot of hot chinese tea served in small cups
4
First time to try Bak Kut Teh soup and glad to say this place served a good quality soup with spare ribs/ pork ribs - very tasty, tender meat and balanced spice. I tried blanced peanuts and green veggies as well as small pork intestines. The black sauce on the table is super sweet and tasty - it goes well with all the food they served. They also serve various loose tea that compliments the food - preparation of tea is quite traditional. All in all highly recommended to try if you're in Singapore and would like to try something different.
5
One of the most famous place for meat and bone soup in town. Just tried their shop inside food court of Sands.Delicious soup base and tender meat, must try when you are in Singapore. Either go to the main shop on Rangoon or stay inside Sands mall and you will find it in the food court, same taste.We tried the internal organs of pig as well, liver, intestines etc, yummy too
3
Food was good, we ordered a large variety of dishes such as spare ribs soup, kidney and liver soup, pigs trotters, vegetables, small intestines.Service was sufficient for an establishment like this, but had to ask for my soup to be refilled twice although the restaurant was not busy.When I approached the cashier to pay for the food, I was served by an extremely pissed off and foul looking man in his 50s with a black face and bad attitude. Asked him if my Jumbo membership gave any discounts but was rudely dismissed. Did not even bother to make eye contact or say thank you when he presented me the receipt.Four stars for the food, and minus one star for the foul looking cashier. Whoever manages this restaurant please consider sacking him. Unpleasant experience
5
The best bakuteh for me! Friendly and quick service. My favourite dish beside the braised pork ribs are pork trotters and braised pork skin. Best side dish of my son: youtiao. He did also get well along with the pepper in the broth. It's worth to mention, there is a great variety of tea at offer, which can be prepared in the traditional style
4
I love this bakkut teh very much..
The spicy but refreshing soup is the best for me.
the pork ribs are very tender and juicy..
1 portion is never enough for me..
4
So came here with the family at 7am. Would be surprised but it was quite busy. Nice ambience but the soup was pre-cooked and very peppery so kids didn't enjoy as much. Pork ribs is also kinda heavy for daily breakfast. Otherwise things were good.
4
A must visit...! Came there last saturday morning with a hungry belly...went back to the hotel with a happy belly :))
5
I have visited this store many times. I have brought many of my foreign friends and they always love it. A must-try for all visitors to Singapore.
5
The soup make the uniqueness of the bowl of 'Bak Kut Teh'. Go for the signature dish instead of normal as the taste of the pork meat make a great different to it. The price is steep but I feel it worthy for such delicacy.
3
Ng Ah Sio BKT was one of of my fav place to have my meal, but 2 weeks ago visited the shop and found the taste have changed and standard drop. Soup is dilute and too spicy, others foods are just average. The dinning environment is good.
5
I was a Bak Kut Teh novice until this place. Now... all I can do is dream of that incredible broth. Seriously outstanding food. The broth is rich and flavoursome while still being incredibly balanced with a good peppery note; the pork spare ribs were tender and delicious. The sides were equally as good; we got the braised peanuts and lettuce, alongside the fried Chinese doughnut. Many reviews of BKT list Ng Ah Sio as their favourite; this has now become my yardstick to measure others by

Continuing our quest for authentic local delicacies, my wife and I were taken to the iconic hole-in-the wall ' Ng Ah Sio ' for a breakfast of ' Bak Kut Teh' and Chiu Chow yummies. Armed with tablets of Aspirin and Crestor to counter the impending Cholesterol attack, we followed our local foodie guru guide.Arriving and seeing photos and posters of Asian leaders and heads of states enjoying the hot bowl of spicy meat soup put us in elite company! Once again, we let our local foodie friend do all the ordering and once again he over ordered! Ha! The food he ordered were exotic, delicious and no chance of getting into any health diet guide books!Just love those tender and chewy pig's intestines, pig's skins and pork hock! As for the star of the meat, the Bak Kut Teh. Initially, the spiciness generated by the use of herbs, spice and peppercorns needs a bit of getting used to, however, after a while, it kind of grows on you.All in all, a most interesting and filling breakfast. Time to skip lunch and do more walking!
5
People are always debating on which bah kut teh joint is the best in Singapore. For me, its definitely Ng Ah Sio. I have been coming here since I was little, long before the shop is sold to the Jumbo group. I was a little skeptic when there was a change in management, but thankfully, they were still as good
3
I had lately visited the famous Bak Kut Teh House Ng Ah Sio. I had noticed that the taste had slightly changed. It might be the I visited the shop so early around 08.00. The pepper was not so strong as last year and the pork from the spare ribs was a bit chewish. It could be the it was too early and the soup and meat was not correct
5
I think what distinguishes this Bak Kut Teh restaurant from others is their excellent soup. It is really peppery and full of flavour. Everyone has their favorite bakuteh joint but this is my favorite because of the soup.
2
Environment is reasonable, not luxurious, but clean. Food price is on high side. Taste of food, any already wonder why so many people, any Bak Kut Teh food store in coffee is equally good, if not, better. Wouldn't be bothered to drive here again
5
Pork ribs soup is perfect taste. Beautiful taste for vegetable lettuce. This is the best Buk Kut Teh in Singapore.
4
Singapore Style Pork Ribs Soup is Teochew Style where is more peppery but the soup is clear. This is unlike the Cantonese Style in Malaysia where the soup is not clear
3
The soup very peppery. The set meal was worth it. It came with a bowl of rice, soup, an egg, a bowl of vegetables and a dish of tau kua and tau pok.
4
Took my HK friend there. I think it is a little too spicy for her, because the HK people don't really take very spicy food, and this store is pretty spicy - but I like it! I used to go to Ah Hwa pork ribs but their standard has deteriorated. Ng Ah Sio maintains the quality of its pork ribs, the black soya sauce, the pepper and its service staff are impeccable. They top the hot soup continuously. If you don't mind sinful food "slightly fat pork ribs, lots of innards, high cholesterol" - this is it! Parking is very easy along Rangoon Road roadside, usually quite a few lots available, but watch the peak hours thoughAdmire the many celebrities' photos on the wall, including ministers/actors etc Only catch is, PAY BY CASH only Not Halal of cours
4
I've always loved coming here with my family to have BKT, the environment is relaxing and inviting.. Rather traditional looking.. Adding to the feels of dining in Ng Ah Sio. Can't emphasize enough on how peppery the soup is! I love it but at times I feel like it can be way too overpowering, I can't really taste the pork broth. But nonetheless it's still very shiok! Meat is a little tough.. Will be perfect if it's softer.. But I don't know, maybe being tougher is the way it's supposed to be. We'll always order the braised tau pok and sotong to go along with the BKT too. Good choice for late dinner too. Another tip, better to drive or take a taxi there.
4
it has been quite sometimes since i last visited this place.... the soup is still very very good , since i like peppery soup. the pork ribs and the pork kidney are very fresh....combined with fried dough and traditional chinese tea, it is so refreshing, a good hearty breakfast... However, this place is quite secluded, it is a bit hard to catch a taxi backfor children be ware of the hot tea kettl
4
I love peppery soup , Ng ah sio serves one of the best BKT Soup in sg. I found the meat a bit tough but otherwise it's all good. All the other dishes were great and the decor and set up was v oriental and lovely
5
Heads of state and tycoons have all been known to pay homage to this institution of Singapore " Eating House" aka " coffee shop" cuisine. The pork ribs were meatier and not too fatty as opposed to the pork bones version. Same soup- peppery and fortifying with spices. You could have rice or Mee sua to go with the ribs. I still prefer plain rice so I could put more of the soya sauce on top. Oh yes, the thick, unctuous dark soya sauce comes in 2 versions: sweet and plain (savoury). I like the sweet version more. Lo Han Guo drink soothed the fiery throat nicely. Will come again definitely.
5
One of the best Bak Kut Teh (Pork Ribs Soup) in Singapore. It has a very strong taste of white and black pepper. It is located 10-15 minutes by taxi from Orchard Road. The restaurant close on every Monday
3
Good food and nice place to have a gathering with friends and family or bring friends from out of town to taste this famous Bak Kut teh.
Do call for reservations as this shop is quite popular.
Highly recommended.
5
Get the signature pork ribs bakuteh. U wont regret. The lettuce side dish also fresh n crispy. Forget the kungfu tea.... just a normal tea if u dont like to drink one. Nothing special. But in overall... awesome place to eat
4
This is a must-try if you love the peppery taste!!! Bah Ku Teh here is known for its strong peppery soup though the pork ribs can be a little too tough for my personal likings.
5
This is the place that i cannot...not come when i visit Singapore :)
Their signature pork ribs have a very rich flavors and the service is fast too. Just be prepare to wait a while if you come on lunch time...
2
I ordered their signature pork ribs soup. The pork is mild but too much pepper inside the soup. I cannot feel the pork broth.
5
I'm a bak kut teh fan, and i've tried a lot of bak kut teh over the past 16 years. I always come back here. It was a lot more localised, before Jumbo Seafood brought over this place, nevertheless, the taste is not compromised. BIG TIPS: you must paired the bak kut teh with "xiao ye gan" chinese tea. After you drink the tea, it will leave a sweet taste in your mouth, then you eat again the spare ribs pork, and that's just flying to the cloud nine for me...downside, it's quite hot inside, especially with the construction of the MRT just beside the restaurant, it feels kinda dark..but it's tolerable for the taste of the best bak kut te
5
I have tried many Bak Kut Teh stalls around town, some are those who some says are the best but fall short of my standards. I can confidently say that this one is best one!I have preferred the peppery-garlicky type of broth for bak kut teh, and so I find that this one is the best I have tasted after trying out many other bak kut teh shops. The broth is not salty, and also not bland. It is just right. Very flavorful and well seasoned. I think it is a bit more peppery than usual (which I prefer) but i find it just right and not overpowering the taste of the meat but rather enhances it. They got options for the prime rib or soft bone, or both. Prices vary depending on which type of meat you are getting. I have tried the mixed rib and soft-bone, and both are very nice and tender, and very meaty for a rib! Soups are re-filled for free.You can have an option to sit indoors or outdoors (but we sat indoors). I am not so sure if it is airconditioned or not (I think it is) because we are sweating because of the hot and peppery soup we are sipping. ^_^Prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food that they serve. Staff are friendly.The only thing that is not so good is that the venue is far from MRT. I am not sure also if there are buses going there. But it surely is worth the travel if you are taking a cab. Bringing your own car is a bit of a challenge too to find a good parking space in the area

This place needs no further recommendations as it is perhaps one of the most famous pork ribs soup in Singapore other than the one further down the road and both have its loyal supporters. Went on a weekday lunch and the place is packed with many business lunch and tourists.The place is run like a restaurant instead of coffee shop as you get served by choosing on a sheet what you like . The servings are small and for the price we paid not worth in my view . We ordered some side dishes which is over priced and taste below average .If you like the pork ribs soup with lots of pepper this is for you and for me though that I like it with pepper, this is too strong for me.
3
Just had lunch today and were deeply disappointed. This is an old famous shop but lost its glory after sold off to a chain. Service was no good and the food also average. The Pork Rib soup came out only warm and thus a failure already. I tasted the soup and it came with a taste tainted with urine or the peculiar pork odour. I lost my appetite already. The pig liver and pig kidney combo is also bad. Some of the liver pieces looked like left over pieces - dry and overcooked. The pig trotter was also average - a lot of hawker stores will be much better. Then I realised why the shop is still not full during lunch hour rush 12.30-1.30pm time zone. I ordered Chinese tea but the tea bag never arrived. When I complained to them, no apology was offered nor any explanation. Sorry to say that this restaurant can be crossed out on my list.
5
I like it so much. The soup is rich with pepper flavour. The place is also close to other similar restaurant. Clean and fast service. Take yourtime and enjoy the ribs...yummy. Beware, this is no halal food.

My family was here for our comfort food of Bak Ku Teh and supporting dishes. Consistent, tasty. Popular restaurant for Politicians, overseas and local, and Common Folks.

This bakut teh might not suitable for everyone. The taste of pepper will explode in your mouth. I personally like it more than several other famous bakut teh in Singapore. But for sure, the price is not cheap.

Apparently the place to go for Teochew Spicy Pork-Rib Soup (Bah Kut Teh) and an assortment of other local culinary delights. We enjoyed a mini feast with local coffeeshop atmosphere. The Bah Kut Teh lived up to its reputation with a full but delicate pepper flavour. Good service

Another tasty bakut teh in Singapore, although it is quite far from city center and quite difficult to find taxi back to our hotel (we went there on Friday night).If I am asked to rank the bakut teh places, it is on 3rd rank after Founders next door and Song Fa in Clarke Quay. Will include it in our list

We went for breakfast on a Saturday. Got there at about 8.30am which was lucky as it started getting filled up fast after 9am.Ordered the pork & spare ribs soup, beancurd & braised lettuce. The broth with the ribs was flavourful, peppery (the Singapore way) but a litle too salty.The beancurd and lettuce was cooked well and dressed well with the right amount of sauces.Very nice breakfast which we all enjoyed. Reasonably priced.Didn't think it stood out over and above the ones along Balestier Road but I have not tried all

This might be subjective, but I feel this is the best pork rib soup I've tried in Singapore. I like the pepperish flavour, along side other stuff that you can choose to complement the soup. I recommend the blanched lettuce, braised peanuts, and the fried You Tiao. Last time I visited, I need to order additional rice to fulfill my appetite

Ng Ah Sio eateries across the island are generally as spiffy as bak kut teh eateries can get but as far as the taste goes, it's a shadow of its former original at Rangoon rd. The soup may be peppery but has none of the tasty robustness one would expect from bak kut teh. In my opinion, not quite worth a visit unless you have no other options.

Pork Rib Soup is the traditional Singaporean food - and here is one of the best places in the Malaysian sector to experience it. The surroundings are simple, bright, clean and spacious. The service friendly and patient, if you don't know the local lingo (point to the menu - which is also in English)Young families, couples, students and the odd tourist all come here - the food isn't too bad either! And reasonably priced.Not too far from the Paya Lebar MRT station (10min

 We were so excited that our youngest daughter who had eaten in your restaurant 5 times had always boasted & praised your bakuteh as her number One in all I have brought her to eat since she was a baby, finally got us seated in your outlet. We ordered almost 8 dishes & were slurping away happily as a family of 4. Unfortunately, the bowl that my older daughter had was disppointing, she had 2 large pieces of the pork rib very tough but both my wife & I couldnt believe as oir were tender & tasty. So we tried biting on hers & true enough, to our horror, they were tough & we couldnt even bit through. 2ndly, the soup we drank were more salty than usual. 3rdly, the yu tiow were not crispy despite we were the only table at 5.30pm, the first & only customer at that time. So we called for Du Qi Yuan to give him feedback. We were very upset & very disapponted with his rotten attitude of trying to find lame excuses to the feedbacks we gave him. If we knew he answered us this way, we would have just held our peace, shut our mouths & dont even bother to feedback so that you guys can improve on it & other customers dont have to suffer our misfortune. He gave this lame excuse that Ng Ah Sio cant guarantee 100% tender pork ribs because if the chef cut the pork in a wrong way, too bad customers have to bear the consequence. Well Mr Ng or senior management executives, would you personally accept such rationale if you were in our shoes. What's more, if you came with an open mind & excited attitude to celebrate eating a dinner with your family, would you be spoilt with such nonsensical reasons given by the so-called responsible chef? His respond & reply pissed me & my enitre happy family off & we wont return if such foul attitude is serving us. I have lost total respect on this outlet because Qi Yuan had done a disservice to us & blatantly marred this reputation you've built so relentlessly all these decades. Though we can be just one family but i reckon a genuine founder wont turn us down. Fortunately, we had this wonderful waitress namely Ms Chou Bee who brought great joy to our dining experience here. She was prompt, very courteous, resourceful, very helpful to all our needs, & a delight to be with.

A little bit hard to find at the first time but it's really worth to try. Pork ribs, Pork skin, and Pork tail is nice. Will be back again when visit SG.

My friend give me recommendation to try this bak kut teh. I try the spare and pork bak kut teh and also braised pig trotter, very yummy. I like also the clear soup.
4
This nice restaurant is located on Rangoon Road, a residential area. The restaurant is clean and the service is good. They specialize on Pork Rib Soup with lots of pepper. It is super popular with Taiwanese tourists. Recommended.
5
Ive been trying so many bakuteh restaurant in singapore city, but i think this is the winner, the soup is very tasty , perfect .... The service is very very fast , this is one of my favorite place to eat in singapore

should try

The location was by the main road so very easy to spot; the interior was spacious and brightly lit. The small touches of decor strewn around the restaurant were rather delightful in their simplicity.The Beau had the Signature Pork Ribs Soup while I had the Signature Spare Ribs Soup. The meat was tender and the soup was heavily peppered, giving it a strong taste very welcoming especially on a rainy evening as such.It was tasty but the flavor was lighter, unlike one of its competitors' in the vicinity. I was also hoping they would have the ribs + innards soup, but over here they do not serve it.We also had some rice, you tiao (fried dough rolls), xiao bai cai veg and braised egg along with the soup.Overall, the food and service here was better than average. The portions may look deceptively small, but they were very filling. Like many Bak Kut Teh restaurants, one may ask for refill of soup as well.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-ng-ah-sio-bak-kut-teh-rangoon.htm

This restaurant is far away from the city centre. After we have visited "Little India", we walk around 10 mins to go there.The attitude of the reception is bad, she seems do not care about customers, somewhat like just wait there or leave and please don't ask. Inside the restaurant is extremely hot, surprisingly it is hotter than sit under the sun.Waiters' attitude are very annoying too, we hardly to finish our ordering. We ordered two bowls of Bak Kuk Teh, two bowls of rice noodle, brine tofu and poached pig kidney with two iced barley.The taste of the food is only average as they all in a same tone - black pepper. In my opinion, the taste is too hot and spicy. Also, it is not valuable. A very very bowl of plain rice noodle cost SGD3.5!!!Besides, customer have to be noted that red pepper and wet tissue will cost you extra money. Also, the GST (7%tax) is not included at the price. Be Careful

Ng Ah Sio definitely serves the peppery variety. Without being over spiced, the balance between pepper and garlic made the broth a pleasure. Only downside was that this was served warm and not piping hot. The spare ribs was however excellent in what I can describe as fall off the bone quality.We also ordered some "spare parts" to go with their signature dish. The Pig's intestine and trotters were very decent with the trotters coming up on top. There was a nice mix of fat and lean and the chilli sauce that comes with it made it a perfect pair.Word of caution: If you order one of their selection of "Kung Fu" Tea, do not, I repeat, do not attempt to stuff the entire content of the loose tea leaves into the tiny pot. First of all, it will not fit and more importantly, the strength of the tea is enough to put hairs on your chest.Just put sufficient into the pot and the great thing is that there is a kettle of hot water that is next to your table for you to top up the tea pot.Overall, a decent dining experience. Is this one of the best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore? Well, for me, the jury is still out

Be early to avoid the lunch queue. Visited this place a couple of time for business and family lunch. the queue will start to form about 11.30 am onwards and earlier fpor weekends. Suggest to go earlier for brunch instead.Place is clean and under the management of Jumbo Restuarant Group. Food and service is generally good. The do serve mee sua as well. Have your spare ribs soup along with lightly boil lettuces, tau pok, tau kee, braised peanut, chay buay and last but not least the fried fitters. This is one of my favourite choice when comes to bak kut teh
2
It just gets worse every year. What once was the best Bah Ku Teh for me and my family and possibly even Singapore now serves a very mediocre and bland bah ku Teh. Just cause they add lots of cheap pepper to create an illusion that the soup is delicious doesn't make it so. It helps but most of us regulars has seen through the cheap trick. Guess the search is on for the next best bah ku Teh.

Ng Ah Sio bak kut teh was used to be my must have in singapore. My recent visit was may 2014. Somehow, it didn't taste as good as before. Pork ribs were tasteless and soup wasn't not as tasty as before. I'm kinda disappointing...
5
I love Bakut Teh (Pork Rib Soup) and I've always tried new places. When my aunt in law brought me to this place, it surprised me of how good the bakut teh soup was! Sure some people said it was too peppery, but personal preference said it was JUST PERFECT for me. If you like soup with peppery feel, this bakut teh might be your next favorite soup!!
3
I have not been in this place for many year. The place is bigger with retro chic feel. However I think the soup now lack of certain peppery punch. It was more mellow in taste. Other than that, everything seemed remain the same as before. The meat still tender, the dark soy sauce remain the same.

I have eaten numerous times at Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh (or Pork Ribs) Eating House. This has got to be a must try dish in our garden city island - Singapore.I've tried both the Rangoon main branch and the newer branch at Tanjong Katong area. The quality is consistent and the restaurants are equally packed during the peak eating hours. The soup has a unique aroma and blend of herbs and pepper mixture. The soup combination is made of up of fresh pork ribs, garlic and a blend of Ng Ah Sio herbs which attracts both locals and tourists alike to their store. I would usually order either the lime juice drink or hot chinese tea to cool the spiciness in the soup due to the strong peppery blast. The soup and ingredients are usually boiled over a long period of time as you would be able to notice the garlic and pepper residue at the bottom of the bowl.Recommendation:1. Signature Spare Ribs Soup2. Side dishes - You Tiao & Preserved VegetableThe Bad:3 portions of Spare Ribs used to be served... and now it has decreased to 2. Therefore, you may want to order other dishes to share with friends / family.For the full review and pictures, you may refer to my blog at: http://adriennehoxy.com/?p=68

Breakfasted at their outlet at Keng Lee Road.First, the good news - the signature pork ribs n soup are still tasty. Now the bad:1. wait staff not proactive, no cut chilli or refill of soup unless prodded;2. just after the meal, I presented tightness at the back of my neck, tightness of breath n general discomfort - classic symptoms of my reaction to MSG!! Verdict? Can't hold a candle to Ya Hwa @ Tg Pagar Complex!
2
The meat was though and tasteless.This is a real disappointment as the pork ribs are their Signature itemThere is an "overdose " of cinnamon in the braised tofu and taupok The "you tiao" was dry and not fresh by dinner timeReal disappointment. Will not patronise them agai
3
This was my 2nd visit of this restaurant. Several years ago when I stayed at Ruffles, the hotel concierge recommended Ng Ah Sio for the best Bak-kut-teh restaurant close by. Very busy in lunch time, servicepersons are not speaking English well, services are fast enough but rough. However, their black peppery, garlicky flavored pork soup worth the try when you are close to this place. Oh, btw. No air conditioning and a boiling water kettle may be next to you... sigh
4
No trip of ours is complete without dining at this place. My husband craves for all that they serve, the ribs in very good soup, their liver and kidney, the intestines, pig trotters etc. I think this the best ribs sop in Singapore. Service is okay, ambiance is so so, typical of a hawker place.
4
First time try this Bak Kut Teh restaurant.. My friend and his wife take me to come here. First enter the restaurant, i like the ambience very much. My friend told me this restaurant is very famous in Singapore, lots of famous poeple come here to eat. And i can see all of that from the photos on the wall. Ordered the bak kut teh, and i agree with my friend, it taste really delicious.. You can ask to refill your soup, but in my opinion the refill soup taste a little bit different from the first time. The first soup is more yummy
5
It is located in Rangoon road and this is my favorite Bak Kut Teh restaurant besides Founder Bak Kut Teh at Balestier road. The soup just have the right amount of garlic and pepper, the soup can be refilled with no charges. The meat also tender and it is best to be paired with traditional chinese tea. The only drawback is that the staffs only can speak mandarin. But the menu comes with english translation so it is fine
4
we've ordered the signature pork ribs soup but the pork is not tender as i expect. but the soup is delicious. i love the pepper and the garlic. and you can ask for refill with no additional charges!!! ;)

A good place to eat peppery bahkut teh, My friend must eat here every time he visits Singapore. The service is good too but the place can be warm so eating a hot soup with a warm atmosphere is uncomfortable.

We are from Malaysia and "bak kut teh" (pork rib soups) is common food. However,unlike Malaysian style where the soup is herbal-based, this is pepper based soup. I agree with the previous reviews that the soup is really good,even though I have tasted others as well. If you ordered Chinese tea, be prepared to make your own tea. There is hot kettle around and you made your own tea.Worth a try when you are in Singapore

The last time I visited Na Ah Sio has to be over 10 years ago, still in the old establishment I thought they were very good. But this time I can't even finish one piece of the pork rib as it was so tough. It feel more like a fast food place then the traditional family run business,, when tourist come to visit singapore , it is one of the must try dish, thus it became just another tourist attraction because of its history but i did not the dishes were prepared with the heart anymore

Ng Ah Sio was recommended in my friend's guide book so we went there for lunch to try it out. The ribs cooked in broth flavoured by pepper and garlic, were quite tender and the taste was intense but not overly peppery. The dish went well with plain rice and veg, accompanied by strong Chinese tea. We were given a tea pot, tea cups and a packet of tea leaves for us to fetch boiling water from kettle next to the table and brew the tea
4
Visited the Rangoon Road restaurant at 8:30 am on a Saturday morning. It was not crowded and we did not wait long to be seated. The pork rib soup was up to standard (and not watery, as in elsewhere). We also tried the pig intestines, pig trotters (served in cut-up pieces and not a whole leg), pig tail soup and tau kwa & tau pok. Definitely genuine food. Service is quick and friendly. The waiteress came round to refill the pork rib soup twice
5
I like bah kut teh very much, and Ng Ah Sio made an excellent one!We ordered two different kinds of ribs, a straight rib & a rib with more meat.The soup was great, with rich pepper & garlic taste. Most important - they offer refill of soup!The ribs tasted great too, very soft & juicy! And the straight rib was then better one, which you could tell from the price.They also sell the soup packs, just buy yourself pork ribs and you can make the delicious bah kut teh at home! Nice

After work today I felt a sudden crave for ‚ÄòBak Kut Teh‚Äò. It has been a while that I had it so a friend and I went to the best I remembered ‚Äì ‚ÄòNg Ah Sio Pork Ribs Soup Eating House‚Äô I went for their ‚ÄòSignature Pork Ribs‚Äò and ordered ‚ÄòBraised Peanuts‚Äò, ‚ÄòFried You Tiao‚Äò, ‚ÄòBlanched Lettuce‚Äò and the ‚ÄòPreserved Vegetables‚Äò.This is the peppery Teochew kind and the broth was very rich and thick and full of pork and of obviously pepper flavour. Best was when the waiter brought the refill which was extremely hot and made it taste even better. As for the ribs I absolutely loved them. They had big chunks of lean meat on them that were easily nibbled off the bones. Since it was so lean the bigger bits tended to be a bit dry but I didn‚Äôt mind it with the soup. From the sides I liked the ‚ÄòBlanched Lettuce‚Äò the best as it managed to surprised me. It still had its‚Äô light green color and was lying in a delicious soy sauce sprinkled with roasted garlic, simple but great. This shop also gave us nice freshly chopped red chilis with sweet dark sauce aside which fitted perfectly to the rice as hot and sweet punched each other in the face.For my full review with pictures please check out the article on my blog:http://getmygrubon.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/ng-ah-sio-rangoon-road-singapore

Took some ex-singaporeans to Ng Ah Sio BKT recently since they were craving BKT and I had not been to Ng Ah Sio in quite a while. Soup was not as flavorful as in the past, but the "superior" ribs were excellent. Trotter was okay, and the rest of the items were so-so. Guess being bought over by Jumbo has taken it toll
4
They open early in the morning and start serving their bak kut teh but if you're looking for a later evening meal the crowds have dissipated but likely also the prime cuts of pork spare ribs. Everything else remains of high quality and the kung fu tea is good
