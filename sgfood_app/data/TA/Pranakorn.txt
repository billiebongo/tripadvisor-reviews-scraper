Located off the beaten Singaporean track, this little place is a gem amongst dozens of other small places to eat in this area. We had Thai curry and all kinds of good stuff. We'll go back.

The staff and chef were very accommodating to our requests.
Very enjoyable and relaxed setting.
Authentic, spicy, and delicious dishes.
Mango sticky rice is a favorite.

Went for lunch with colleague and stumbled on this gem of a place. Very authentic Thai roadside stall feel, food was good. Well presented and efficient. Not a place other than with friends or in small groups. Will come back again.

I have seen the reviews and Pranakorn has been on my must do list for some time. Its now ticked off and I'm pleased to have visited and I will be back...Now, there are some inventors who are unknown to history. There are some inventors who really haven't invented anything, just adapting someones else's ideas. For instance, Dyson adapted an existing industrial dust filtration system (the cyclone) and made it into a vacuum cleaner. He neither invented the cyclone or the vacuum or, for that matter, the digital motor. What he did was to adapt existing designs and technology to a different application. Fair play to the guy.But the woman (for it had to be a woman as no man could have possibly thought of this) decided one day to take an unripe papaya and turn it into a green salad with chili, tomatoes, lime juice and peanuts. That was a simple stroke of genius. I guess she didn't get rich off her idea, nor will she ever be know. Let me say - she was a truly great inventor.The Green Papaya Salad at Pranakorn is simply out of this world and a great testament to that known lady from Thailand. Oh - I also had the Thai Spicy Pork with Basil, rice and a fried egg, with a side of Thai style fried Kangkong. Both were delicious. Kangkong is a water spinach, milder in flavor but the long stalks make it nice and crunchy. Its fried with garlic and Thai spices and its wonderful. I'm going to try this back home using spinach - but I already know its not going to be as good

Dined there one evening, had vermicelli chicken and veg and red curry noodles. Both dishes excellent with good fresh flavours. Which enticed us back the next night. Both had the red curry noodles one with pork one with chicken. How totally different. Could not eat it. Like red curry paste and oil and packed with endless whole kaffir lime leaves. Barely cooked meat. Different chef. They didn't want to know and would not offer to rectify it. Basically that's how it is today, like it or not. You order on a form and go pay at the counter before being served. The staff are not attentive at all. If you go when the good chef is on you will get great food. But if it's not great, don't expect any customer service. Average pricing.

I ate at this quaint cafe having noticed they served mango and sticky rice which I find hard to come by out of Thailand. The cafe is really nicely appointed with good tables and chairs and the staff were really fabulous. My Thai noodle soup was beautiful and the broth was something that I so wish I could reproduce; it was amazing. Then the highlight came with my mango and sticky rice dessert; exquisite. So good I think I need to sneak another in before I fly out

Food- We tried the basil pork rice and the thai vermicelli chicken with vegetables. Generous servings and tasty. The traditional thai ice milk tea is good as well. Not diluted as some other places. We tried one of the dessert as well - the grass jelly with brown sugar. A novelty - didnt really see this in other places. Mix well and the taste is good.Location - Changi village areaService - Good without being overbearingValue- Good as their generous helpings offset slightly higher prices as compared to other thai eateries at heartland areas. Overall, 2 mains, a drink and one dessert, less than $20Valu

Pranakorn is a sidewalk Thai restaurant facing Changi Village Road. It's a very short walk from where I was staying at the Village Hotel. I was wandering, looking for somewhere to eat, saw an empty table in the outside section and sat down. The 'inside' area was open also, but much more air-conditioned. I am not tropics adapted but found outside entirely comfortable.There were some a la carte photo-menus and set-meals menus waiting at the table. There was also a little pad and pencil, where you could fill-in your own orders. I chose the steamed deep sea bass in a lemon/lime broth, kai lan - an unknown vegetable dish to ward off scurvy, fragrant rice, and (of course) mango sticky rice to follow. As my meal progressed I came to suspect the steamed bass was their signature dish, there were very few tables where it was not served. I also ordered a beer and a 'thai' milky iced tea.The fish came in a metallic fish-shaped dish upon a spirit burner. It was accompanied by an inverted-bowl serve of rice and the vegetables in a separate oval ceramic plate.The fish was delightful. It was succulent and delicious, immersed in a lovely flavorsome broth. I found myself sipping the broth after I'd polished-off the fish, it was so lovely. The rice was entirely up to par. The kai lan was tasty but paled a little alongside that glorious fish, and somehow managed to ambush me with a large piece of fiery chili.The tea was a strong, sweet, milky iced concoction. It was very refreshing and tasty, and helped sooth my spasming oesophagus from its inadvertent chili overdose.The sticky rice mango did not disappoint with the mango perfectly ripe and delicious.It became apparent that my timing was a little lucky. Half an hour after I sat every table was filled and there were small groups waiting for vacancies to develop.I dined solo, being a business visitor, and ate too much. I also ordered their most expensive dish, which would have been more appropriate for several more people. All the same the final bill will not garner any CFO attention, and it was a lovely meal. Thinking of the other tables around me it's clearly popular for families and young couples

This place serves great Thai food and prices are reasonable. It caters for both adults as well as children. Their service is great, with helpful and knowledgeable staff ever ready to provide assistance. Location is good as it can be easily located with nice and clean ambience for couples, families and even in groups. Food served are piping hot and fresh too.
