I've been ordering cakes from this cafe for the longest time. Absolutely love the home-made fresh cream on the Classic Strawberry cake and the alcohol-soaked Brandied Cherry cake. Super-soft sponge, fresh fruits and milky fresh cream. Haven't visited the cafe though and I understand it has closed recently to focus on only the online delivery business. I would highly recommend anyone who likes cakes.

They are definitely cake experts! Had the blueberry cream cake that was custom made with a chosen design. The blueberries were fresh and the cream light and delightfully smooth. Wasn't too sweet and very delicious. I ordered online and the cake was delivered in perfect condition
