Just grade A amazing food, wonderful presentation & impeccable service round the board. Plus, an ever-changing menu's more than enough to keep me coming back for more. Thanks Jose!

Loved everything about this place. Right from the decor to the service and of course the food. Very clever way of presenting the menu in a pack of cards - as the menu changes often. The food was a fusion highlighting our local Singapore flavours. I have to say, how creative the team is, coming up with the amazing flavours. All the dishes were explained to us and they made us guess the key ingredients - which was very fun. :) I will highly recommend this place to everyone. If you have dietary restriction - that is not a problem as they will work around it for you

We arrived at the restaurant at 8:30 and we got our food at 10pm and the restaurant was quiet (only 2 other tables).We had to ask for menu multiple times and they only had 5 sets of menu which was hand written in paper cards with no description so we had to guess what the food will be like. Don't mind sharing menus but it was weird they only had 5 sets available.We wanted wine but they didn't have wine menu and we had to choose between red or white so we chose white. The waiter said no menu available so he brought 4 wines which were available. All of the wines were already open but the waiter expected we will just drink them. We refused to order already opened wine and he said they don't have any other wines and he will deduct $20 from each bottle if we take them.We asked to being whatever wine which is not opened and he managed to bring 2 at the end and we didn't know what we were drinking and how much (it was $68 per bottle on our bills).We ordered beef, chicken and risotto (they were around $28-35 - from main section) and it was size of entree and very very average food. Some of the food component was cold.After 1.5 hours of waiting it was a total disaster and we just wanted to pay and get out. We asked for a bill which also took long time.I suggested this restaurant based on TripAdvisor reviews and not sure what these people are on about. My friends were so angry after dining here we didn't care how much the bill was, we just wanted to pay and leave.Extremely slow terrible service, average but overpriced food, trying very hard to be funky (menu in cards, creative food presentation, etc) all I can say is - never again and pls do yourself a favor by not going to this restaurant

My daughter suggested this restaurant for my 54th bday celebration - couldn't have been nicer. Chef Addis and his team scored in every area - variety, creativity, presentation, and especially taste. (Great service too). Dibs will be our go to celebration venue.

Went for dinner with friends and was impressed at how cleverly all the dishes were created. A lot of thought and creativity is behind each dish, multiple flavours that are carefully constructed to complement each other. Great presentation too. Each dish came with an explanation that makes you admire the innovation behind it. Very highly recommended for true gourmands

To start with the menu is a deck of handwritten cards. Reason: it changes all the time and it easy to update. Divided into starters, mains and desserts, there isn't a long list of choices. And each course has a DIBS? Special where the chef surprises you with a dish. Since there were 4 of us, we were able to order a range of each course and taste many of the dishes. Won't give details of dishes so as not to spoil the surprise :)Verdict: very innovative and talented chefs. We were delightfully surprised by the great presentation and wonderful taste of every dish. Great use of local ingredients to create the fusion of tastes, dressings and sauces. And just try and guess what the hydrated crackers presented with some dishes are - you'll be stumped each time. Our compliments were extended to Chef Dillon at the end. A very talented young man.Service was excellent - friendly, caring engaging

When we were first asked for the menu we were stunned at its presentation. Pretty unusual and confusing but the chef soon explains it. There isn't a lot to choose from just 5 dishes per course. There aren't any pictures of the food. So it was rather exciting to see how it would turn out. I like the idea that they had a mystery dish so every time you go back, there is always something different. Just let the chef know your allergies if you intend to get the mystery dish. We opted for the set as it was a better deal. Portion for each course was just nice for 1 person. Each dish was plated with perfection and the food taste great. Indeed it was really a menu from the heart! Great place to go for special occasions or bring your date if you want to impress someone! They are able to host parties as well!

We went to this restaurant with not much expectations. Firstly, we were very well greeted by manager Jose, a very friendly spaniard who made us feel at home. He also demonstrated that he is a very well mannered waiter and sommelier. Regarding the food, it was really high quality skilled cooking which took us by surprise (see pictures). We have dined in the past in Michelin star restaurants and the level was not as high in many occasions. All the flavors really work together, the pairings were clever, imaginative and refined, the meat was cooked to perfection. And the best part, everything for $58 per person! 3 courses dinner for that price in Singapore is a steal.I highly recommend to try this hidden gem in Duxton Road.

Unassuming and understated, yet the food is way beyond awesome! Looks are deceiving indeed! I can't really describe the food accurately because I'm not sure if adjectives have been invented for them yet hahahahhaOne thing for sure, it makes you feel like having seconds, which you really might just do and not forgetting their Inedit Damm beer, it's damm good hahI like how the space and the ambient is casual for one to enjoy these modern cuisine with no pressure at all...and service is friendly, great locale and a beautiful upper floor (note to myself, company Christmas/year end dinner candidate)I'd strongly recommend this hole-in-the-wall gem to tourists and locals alike, not your average nor daily fare, thus

Cozy place to dine in... and food was great and amazing.i would defenitely suggest to everyone to dine here. bottomline its amazing experience.
5
Simply put, fine food in a casual setting. Prices are very reasonable at 3 courses for $58+
Menu is also changing every month.

Located on Duxton road- accessible from Tanjong Pagar and Outrum Park stations. I celebrated an unconventional thanksgiving/birthday dinner with a friend- and this was ABSOLUTELY the right choice. Not only was the food beautifully presented, but it was incredibly delicious! I had roasted veggies with a local sauce for my appetiser, duck for the main and a 'kinder surprise for adults'- a magical chocolate egg dessert- to end the meal. I am definitely coming back and bringing a bigger crowd; I want to try everything on the menu. Staff were also very friendly and personal. I'm hooked.

We sat outside and had a great time with really the best food I ate in Singapore so far. All other restaurants at Duxton Hill were packed, this one not yet...this is a hidden gem, not so expensive and really excellent food and service, go there and try it your self

Visited the refurbished restaurant last week for a friends gathering. The restaurant is located along Duxton road, which is packed with quite a few notable eateries. Like most previous reviews, I would consider DIBS a hidden gem. The ambiance is pleasant and deco interesting, with an industrial feel to it. There are also many mason jars of preserved vegetables on the wall. However, the deco on the walkway walls can be slightly improved, the creative painting look like unfinished paints dripping. The food is an innovative fusion, European food using Asian ingredients. The menu changes pretty regularly and this would be good to keep guests coming back to try new creations. In order to keep up with such regular changes, the dishes are listed and presented as decks of cards. Again, something not so common among local restaurants and attention to details is worth complementing. Our party of six was impressed with the food quality on the whole. Worthy of particular mention is the 'Bak Choy' starter (scorched vegetable leaves paired with saffron as salad), squid rings with Yuzu flavoured dips, deconstructed ratatouille, duck stuffed with mint and spices, nicely done beef, risotto served with Thai-infused flavours. The staples that come together with the mains are unique too, such as sweet potato puree. The desserts are creatively done, and include surprises for the palate. There is currently a promotion for 3-course set dinner at 58/++, which is pretty worth the money. Service was also good, with both the manager and chefs checking in on us regularly to make sure the food is served properly. The only slight complain is the slightly smaller food portions for the mains. Good dining experience on the whole.

We arrived at the agreed place in Duxton on a wet Friday night to find that we had no reservations there. Proceeded to tramp around looking for a place to dine. Either the places were all fully booked or they were eerily quiet - like DIBS. We hung around outside and then were approached by chef Edis who told us about the menu and then manager Jose, bearing spicy masak merah and healthy spinach crackers. Both were very warm personalities and we decided to dine there to give the place a chance. We were offered the 3 course set dinner for $58, and there were about 6 choices for each appetizer, main and dessert - which is a pretty impressive selection for a set meal. If you didn't feel like deciding, you could have the surprise set. We did not have high expectations because no one was there on a friday night. Also, the decor gives you the impression that its a casual eatery specializing in chicken wings and pizza, nothing complicated. We were immediately impressed by the look of the appetizers, especially the fried parmesan sticks served with cheese and egg yolk and (looking like a sunny side up egg) a robust, punchy tomato dip. The other appetizers were also well received - the capsicum salad was tasty, esp with the bits of coarse ground salt; the mussels were small (which we preferred) and tasty. And the fried calamari managed to distinguish itself with the accompanying yuzu mayo (very yuzu-ish!) and the tart and spicy pepper/lime(?) sauce. Wow! Of the mains, the sous vide pork belly with garlic puree was stand out - looked like butter and was melt-in-the mouth. The sea bass, was perfectly cooked - no complaints. The duck roulade with spinach - i did not enjoy it coz it tasted like ham as it had been smoked and tenderized. But the duck skin, which was served separated from the meat, was divine to eat especially with some red wine. Dessert was also a delight. The churros were crunchy and the meringue light. The crispy orange slice had a bitter taste which balance out the sweetness from the other elements. Beautifully plated - like an ode to autumn! I loved the presentation of the chocolate egg, encasing a trio of berries and popcorn - won't say more, please try. The mac and cheese - macaroon and dragon fruit cheesecake was quite light and tasted very floral. The service was very good, lean of staff but it doesn't matter, better to have one staff who knows everything than 10 who don't. Great job, Jose - thanks for continuously filling our glasses with water and wine. And also chef Edis for coming to tell us more about the food. The food presentation and quality is of a high standard, the dishes are well though out to give the diner a fun experience, and all the dishes had many components in them. Unfortunately, this restaurant is let down by its misleading decor (skater park meets rustic garden picnic?) which does not communicate to people the dining concept that they are delivering. Also, the ventilation indoors can be improved. All said, I would still come back with other friends and family and I hope this restaurant will succeed - great staff, and we can see the passion in the dishes. Good luck

I went there with my wife and a few other friends last week for a wine pairing event. Their staff are very friendly and energetic. And the food was really good. If you are there you should try the pork belly with apple, it was really fantastic. We would definitely come back for this dish. Another thing which you don't want to miss out is their chocolate surprise dessert. Imagine a coconut ice cream with chocolate topping and rum. You really can't go wrong with this choice. It is not so sweet, but it will leave a nice after-taste in your taste buds. Overall a great experience, highly recommended for a nice meal with your friends and family

Came here to meet few friends on Saturday evening. Service was prompt and friendly, love the menu cards in the box concept. My friend ordered the 3 course meal for $58 while I ordered only the mains. The fish dish was seabass with avocado sauce and curry flavor puree on the side. Fish was fresh, the flavor was a nice fusion of Asian and Western food. Overall experience is good and it's a place to appreciate food, but hope for more affordable deals. Tried some of food my friends ordered and they are all yummy

I've been going to DIBS ever since I stumbled upon the gem a year ago. The owners, a lovely bunch of locals who radiate warmth are the epitome of hospitality. Upon speaking to them, their credo wasn't just to improve their restaurant but their characters. Atmosphere utterly mirrored their personalities. Warm and welcoming, with a tinge of charm ;

Quite pricey. Restaurant was quite empty on a Saturday night. Restaurant ran out on Beef on a SATURDA

1st time at DIBS. Everything was excellent. We had the tuna tartare, snapper ceviche, beef rendang with fries, short ribs and skirt steak. All was excellent. We finished off the meal with apple pie with candied bacon. Left DIBS feeling very full and satisfied.

Food was interesting but couldn't satisfy my taste buds. Service was prompt when one of their service crew spoil the wine and they immediately replaced a new bottle for me. Overall experience was considered good.

This menu here is creative and delicious. It is an eclectic mix between tapas and western classics.
The restaurant could be a bit more "homely" but the prices are very reasonable.
Would recommend for a casual dinner.

The food was good and the table outside ( only two) perfect to share a good moment with friends.
Not too expensive for Singapore

I am not sure if Dibs categorised their food as fusion, but the menu sure looks fusion to me. And more importantly, they are really tasty & interesting!My favourite would be the Beef Rendang Poutine $14 (fries with rendang and cheese curds) and we totally enjoyed it. The fries is crispy, while the rendang sauce has a good balance of spiciness and sweet richness, and the meat is nice & tender. The Blistered Sprouts - grilled brussel sprouts with jalapeno & calamansi fish sauce is also very tasty though we find it to be on the oily side. The three and last dish we tried is the Bovril Short Ribs. The meat is very tender and flavourful with a tint of sweetness. Recommended for people that enjoyed Bovril. The servings are quite generous for the price, and we also find the wines - Chilean Sauvignon Blanc & Tempranillo to be fresh and are good pairing with the food. Last but not least, compliments to the Manager Jose who is very hospitable and a joy to chit chat with. The slight blemish of the experience is the rather plain design of the restaurant and hence the place may not be very suitable if you are planning to impress your date with the ambience. Jose shared that they will be renovating the restaurant soon.In summary, an unpretentious place with interesting and delicious menu with good wine & service. Will definitely be back to try the rest of dishes on the menu.

I have walked past this restaurant at Duxton many times on my way to meetings. But I never had the chance to dine here until recently when I had a gathering with friends. It had been a sweltering afternoon and we decided to sit inside to enjoy the air-conditioning. They have some seats al fresco and additional dining area on the second floor. On the ground floor, the kitchen takes centre stage, with an open concept kitchen, where you can see the chefs at work. The kitchen is compact but highly functional. They have Estrella beer on draft which we promptly ordered, and thereafter our food. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Baked eggplant: $14. Eggplant marinated with miso and topped with mentaiko (marinated roe of Pollock/ cod) and sesame seed. Its nice. - Tuna Tataki: $18. Lightly seared tuna steak, sliced and served with jalapeños, yuzu ponzu and Ito togarashi. Great presentation. Its tasty. - Seared Scallops : $21. Nice caramelisation on the scallops and served with chorizo bits, leeks and soy beans. Not bad. - Garlic Chicken: $16. Chicken breast cooked sous-vide and served with black garlic, apple relish and crispy chicken skin. The chicken looked like fish fillet and had a nice firm bite. Went well with the black garlic paste. The chicken skin was crispy and resembled ‘Tow Kee’ (dry beancurd sheets). Must try! - 48:60 Bovril Short Ribs: $21. The Bovril short ribs were marinated and slow cooked for 48 hours in 60 degree water sou vide. Its served with tempura daikon and pumpkins with green chilli relish. The beef was soft and tender and flavourful. Very enjoyable and we finished this in no time. - Blistered Sprouts: $12 Halved Brussels sprouts cooked with jalapeño, calamansi fish sauce & topped with rice crispies. The fish sauce added a nice tangy taste to the dish, which paired well with the charred bits of the Brussels sprouts. Nice! - Spiced Lamb Shoulder: $20. The lamb was medium and done perfectly. I also loved the cumin eggplant purée and sweet bread. The pickled eggplants gave a sharp stink on my tongue which was soothed by the yoghurt. This dish has a Moroccan feel to it. Must-try! - Milk & Honey: $13. Milk Ice Cream with milk crisp, camomile honey and honey comb. The ice cream has a distinct milk flavour. The garnishes add honey flavour to each mouthful, which can be a tad too sweet. - Apple Pie: $16. Cinnamon apple pie, buttermilk ice cream and candied maple bacon. This is one of my ‘To Die For’ desserts and a highlight of my meal. The apple pie has a ight fluffy crust and it was chockful of cubed apples within. The candied bacon with maple syrup is the ‘piece de resistance’. It was crispy and taste good with the maple syrup! Highly recommended! The restaurant has a special where you can order any 5 items on the menu for $88. This is good for sharing amongst 2 people. I am impressed with the food. Definitely on my ‘recommended’ list of restaurant to dine, when friends ask me for places to dine. Highly recommended

I was passing by Duxton road with my friend when the manager a Spanish guy suggested us to sit outside and take a drink.Finally we had a few tapas and was very good!We tried the garlic chicken in different textures and was excellent. Also the lamb shoulder was very tender, soft and melted.I was very impressed about the service, very attentive and pleasant.The food was excellent.I have to come back to try the dessert!!!It looks so yummy!!!

I had dinner with a whole bunch of friends here and it was perfect. The dishes are priced and sized nicely for sharing which allows you to try a bit of everything. Really unique dishes priced appropriately to ensure guests get the best value. Great vibe upstairs as well for a big group to hang out post dinner for drinks. Highly recommended and will be back

I found out about dibs thru online blogs and such. Through their website, their menu looked interesting enough, and reviews were favourable, for this bar bistro. Turns out, they've changed the style to more of a tapas bar, where dishes were smalller (cheaper in price too), so it encouraged you to order more variety. So we just went with the flow and order the short ribs, pork cheek, scallops, and rice balls! And a side of asparagus. Everything was decent except for the pork cheek in my opinion. It seemed wasted in the deep fried batter. It tasted fine, but lacked the sophistication of the others. The scallops, for me was different, but as i found out thru the chef, that was how it was suppose to be! medium rare, which was a little to sticky in the center. Seasoning however was excellent. Service was good, mainly because there was hardly anyone else, given that this was a monday night. A bit dead, but on the bright side, id take that over a fully loaded room, where you would have to shout to converse. Location was average. We were seated right next to the kitchen, separated by a walk way, and the glass of the kitchen wall. Sitting outside might have a better ambience. So all in all, this place is decent for hanging out with friends or colleagues. Food is decent, and service was good. So if u can ignore the interior, or sit outside, you might find this an ideal location.

This restaurant is absolutely worth a visit. The decor is great, the staff is young and unexperienced but trying their best. The chef is excellent, the food is absolutely the main reason to put this restaurant on your list. The three of us had duck with foie gras, surf&turf, lamb - all very different. But we all agreed that the dishes were all high quality.Our compliments!!
