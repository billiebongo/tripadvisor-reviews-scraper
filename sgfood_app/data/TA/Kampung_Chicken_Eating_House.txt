Delicious kampung chicken rice. Other stir fried dishes are pretty decent too. E.g. Sambas kangkong, kailan with prawns. Stir fried fish

Been wanting to try this restaurant out a number of times and finally get to do it today.No frills chicken rice stall that comes with some tze char dishes which were pretty good as I can taste the "wok hei" in them. The chicken was tender and juicy. Some of the chicken rice stall offered chicken that were relatively under cooked which was not what I like but the chicken from this place was well-cooked. Very competitive prices

Kampung Chicken Eating House. The kampong chicken was soft and juicy, , when dipped on the ginger chilli and dark soy sauce, it resulted in good combination of flavour all together, i quite enjoyed the lunch adventure. The free range chicken is absolutely tasty, tender and juicy even for the chicken breast. It is indeed very reasonably priced. Although the restaurant's location was out of the way, it didn't stopped regulars from making their way there. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. A very enjoyable lunch experience

Went a few times to this chicken rice shop before mookata shop opens. At first, there are a lot of meat in the beginning, now i think maybe because of inflation. The chicken has become smaller. Please note, this is a kampung chicken and not frozen chicken so the skin is yellow in colour. It taste better than frozen chicken in other places. Price wise is standard. This place is not crowded even when it is in weekends.

I have always wanted to eat here due to rave reviews. I was expecting some awesome chicken rice from yesteryears but was disappointed. The chicken while tender was quite bland to me. The rice was not fragrant and I did not enjoy the strong ginger taste in the chili. There is already ginger sauce on the side. The saving grace was the black chicken soup. While the food is not lousy, I wouldn't rave about it.

We saw a review for this small street side restaurant, an easy walk from many of the hotels along the upper stretch of the river, so we walked in and had a 1/2 chicken with rice and a couple lime juices. Nice chicken, moist and tasty. Good meal

We were looking for a quick dinner near NUH hospital, and happily went along with a family recommendation to try kampung chicken (a particular style of chicken rice, and not serving the roasted variety).We were not disappointed by the extremely high recommendation! The chicken is superb and they use the small kampung chickens (not the huge ones from elsewhere)- so while some may be frustrated prying the flesh from bones, it's worth it for the amazing flavour and texture. The rice was just delicious leading to severe overeating, and the chilli sauce was brilliant and packed a good punch.We also had some stir fried prawns and samba like veg, both good. The other standout apart from the chicken was the chicken noh hgien- super super fresh, flavoursome and yummy sauce. Polished this off even though it's not usually a favourite.The place is a simple eatery but with enthusiastic aircon, quick service and options to order smaller portions if you are only ordering for a couple. There is plenty of chicken rice in Singapore... But This place is well worth the trip- you won't be disappointed :)

I went there for lunch today with my mum. We ordered 2 chicken rice sets for $4.70 each and some other add ins. By far one of the best chicken rice (secret is in the Chilli) in Singapore. However, the soup has some vegetables which I m not used to having in soup. One thing that I'm unsure of is why the rice served in bowls and not on plates

Initially we want to have a night bite to one of the bakery shop in the area but unfortunately they closed at 10pm, so we walking around and decided to have dinner in this place...and to be honest with just a little expectation...but to our surprise the food is very good. Rice is fragnance and tasty, not too oily, the chicken is tender even they stir fried bean sprout is excellent. For 5 person we only need to pay SGD 30....definitely value for money.

Came here for late lunch and the place is not too crowded, just right. Nice location n it opens from 10:45am til 12 midnight. Very local feel. The rice is so-so n I would rate it towards the slightly blend and abit moist, comparing to other stalls/shops that sell the same thing. Fried bean sprouts with salted fish is a tad oily. Food was served quite quickly. The white cabbage soup/broth is abit blend too but it's ok as it suppose to wash down the strong taste. Other than that, the lime juice drink is ok. The chicken is tender and fresh. The Chilli is good either alone or with the blended ginger. I prefer the later. Reasonably priced

Had a craving for chicken rice and found this place nearby. Rice is tasteless, soup is bland, chicken is tough. The saving grace was the chilli. Honestly, this is one of the worse chicken rice I have eaten.

This is just a few meters away from my hostel (Plot Hostel) and I'm glad it offers a Solo meal (chicken) for solo travelers like me. At night, the place becomes packed with locals and tourists... a good indication of its popularity and great food!

We were brought here by a local. Would never find this place as a tourist. The chicken, the rice, the lime juice, the cold crab, the stirfry vegetables were all excellent.
5
They have many outlets. This outlet offers cold crabs and stir-fry dishes too such as sweet potato leaves. These chicken are believed to be reared differently - free range. more healthy. Rice is great and chicken quite tender.

good taste and good portion of food. They don't have that much variety, but all the dishes we ordered are quite good. Try out stir-fried bean sprout, too!

We ordered chicken rice and the rice was really nice, chicken soft and tender plus we were given free cabbage soup/broth. Price is ok though I wish the portion was a bit bigger. Also very crowded at night so best time to eat is lunch time or afternoon

I walked down the strip here trying to figure out which resto to choose. Picked this one as it seemed the most popular. Didn't pick up that Chicken was the speciality here, despite name - must have been jetlagged. The menu offered was a "choose a picture" type and I was a little lost and no assistance was offered.I chose a cuttlefish dish and it arrived very promptly. Served with excellent rice and cabbage broth. No chopsticks offered so requested them. Beer provided for cash payment by next door resto. The food was fine but nothing special, in my opinion, but that may have been down to my choice. Resto was extremely popular. Will prob try one of the other places on this strip next

Traditional no frills cafe style restaurant selling Singapore’s favourite Chicken and rice dish. We were taken here by a born and bred Singapore colleague for a quick lunch. We entered and exited via the back door through the kitchen! there’s parking at the back. Chicken is the yellow variety (with bones) and came with rice and a cabbage broth and three little pots of soy, garlic and chilli to dip. we had an excellent bean sprout side dish, and a fried Tofu, food was good on the whole not really used to the bones in the chicken, but the place was full of locals so that’s a good sign anywher

There's lots of chicken rice in Singapore, this is one that stands out. Recommended by a taxi driver who says this is the best in SG. Indeed! Rice is fragrant, chicken is tender. And there's other dishes you can order. Will return to sample other dishes, together with the chicken rice.
