Similar to what you get from subway but you'll have a more personal experience.
Cleaner modern day cafe look with friendly staff!

This is a small privately owned business. They serves various types of subs. The sandwiches and meats are very tasty. Their subs are better than SUBWAY. Until I ate a Watsub i thought subway had the best sandwiches.Value for money.The people are very polite and accommodating

Oh well. It's always me & my missus looking for a good place to eat. And this time we are really hungry as it's already 3pm and we haven't had lunch. Yet.So we decided to give this new place called the East Village a visit & have a look what the fuss is all about with all it's eateries & start-up shops.I was not about to have something heavy or that would spoil our dinner appetite, and that's when we say this small cozy place called WATSUB. It's located just by the entrance to the building and adjacent to the carpark.First look and you'll think its is somewhat similar to SUBWAY, the HALAL version o fit.But look closely at the menu, you will notice some interesting fusion sandwiches.It's a nice place to go for a quiet lunch or dinner. They accept all kinds of payments and all their staffs are young and are always willing to serve you.They have indoor & outdoor seating's and seats are pretty limited.I say, give it a try, support this boys out and tell them your honest opinions about the place so that they could learn more.A personal note from me to WATSUB crews - If you have to smoke, do not do it outside your own entrance, it's not professional & people don't like to cigarette scents while they are eating outdoor

Singapore is truly a food paradise. The options are simply mindboggling and food is readily available around the clock. In the past few years, halal dining options have increased by many-fold and we are truly spoilt for choice.Watsub is located is the quaint East Village mall near Simpang Bedok. The area is overflowing with many restaurants, but Watsub stands out for their delicious, freshly made gourmet sandwiches. They have many options for bread and fillings, and your heart just skips a beat when their little oven goes 'ding'! Their meal combos come with either a choice of fresh homemade mushroom soup/roasted baby potatoes/nachos with salsa and drink. I love watching them assemble their sandwiches, an engineering feat considering the generous amount of filling and vegetables that go in it. Prices are also reasonable, although some might balk at paying so much (~$8?) for a sandwich (but it's a delicious sandwich!
