New location but same high standards. Go here. You will not be disappointed. Well worth a trip out to the west coast of Singapore.

Well off the beaten track in a fairly non descript setting but good solid North Indian food at great prices and solid service. Friendly staff make all the difference. Nothing fancy but if you just want decent food at good prices then worth a visit.

Insightsuite would like to rate this as top Indian restaurant in the western part of Singapore. It started at Pasir Pasang Village & then got relocated near to Clementi & again moved to current place which is next to the supermarket. It has outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangement. The food quality has been maintained well throughout its 10 year journey. Rumali roti is something which is unique bread out here besides normal naan & roti. The quantity of food is adequate for at least two persons. It serves beer & other alcoholic drinks & is rated A. It remains open until 10 pm & is closed in the afternoon during siesta. NUS is nearby & next door is a wet market as well as a hawker center but still makes good business. It can accommodate a big group by rearranging the tables upon request. Take away food can be ordered over the phone & we do it many times. Butter chicken & daal tadka is my favorite. Especially when it rains, it is quite romantic to sit outdoors & watch shoppers moving by. Since this place is at one corner there is less traffic & if you are driving then a big pay & park lot is just behind. This place has reduced our trips for good north Indian food to city from the west

*Please note the new location at Block 721 Clementi West Street 2. This is absolutely great, authentic Indian food. The owner is always there and personally sees to tables. He recommends dishes and is very helpful if you aren't familiar with the dishes. We love the naan basket with different types of naan, and the potato and green bean with eggs is a very nice dish with fresh, crispy green beans. We always try different dishes, and they are all delicious. Highly recommended

This place is fairly local to us. We have lived here for 6 years now and never gone despite good reviews from friendsHave to say I wish we tried this place sooner. It is quite basic but the food is fantastic. We started with the Veggie Roll to share between the two of us. It is awesome, too big for two based on other things we ordered. We followed this with Chilli Chicken, Prawn Jalfrezi and mushroom/pea dish that I do not remember the name of. We also had the veggie pilau rice.Service was timely and friendly and the food was fantastic. Not a place to go if you are looking to wine and dine or for special occasions but as a place to enjoy good food with friends it is exceptiona

We bought a Groupon voucher and visited the place. Service was very bad and the staff didnt even greet us in entrance. Food are over-priced. 16$ for paneer butter masala. We ordered a veg biriyani which was half cooked. Rotis were very hard. Lassi was terrible. We came out of the restaurant disappointed. Over-rated and over priced. Not worth the money. Guys dont waste your precious money eating here!!!!!!!!!!!

Good selection and spread of North Indian food prepared reasonably well. Tandoori breads are made very well. Open to customization as well if certain items are not on the menu. Staff is very good. Nice open air sitting space outside. Good for close 8-10 people party too
