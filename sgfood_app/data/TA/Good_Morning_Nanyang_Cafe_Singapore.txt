Had the orange ciabatta style kaya toast. Absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend it. Kopi was good too

We stopped in here on our wandering breakfast (had small dishes at another two places prior to this). Loved the iced coffee, enjoyed the soft boiled egg, enjoyed the crispy toast but didn't get the coconut jam it had been spread with. I would have just preferred butter so I could dip it in the runny egg! Friendly service and excellent air con

We often visit CSC for the toy market during Sundays and this is one of our favourite joints. Traditional brew of local coffee with a good mix of either generously buttered toast or a nice bowl delightful dry MeePok (Local fare) to start the day, keeping the hunger at bay. Things to try include local coffee, buttered (or a sweet local jam called Kaya for those with a sweet tooth) toast, dried meepok and also the yummy ice lemon tea. Love it

By pure luck I entered this place, which is close to my office. I'm glad I did.They have some nice choices of toasts, sandwiches, or even meals, for those more hungry in the morning.This typical singaporean Kopi is something delicious, if a bit on the sweet side.The long wood benches and tables somehow reminded me of those typical japanese Izakayas. With a lot less beer and smoke, of course. Highly recommended
