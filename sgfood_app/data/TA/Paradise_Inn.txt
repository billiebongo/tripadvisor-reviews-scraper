Visited with a group of 10 for business lunch. We had the CNY special salad (Lao Yu Sheng) and a wide cariety of meets (prawn, fish, ribs) along with egg drop soup. All the food was delicious and the service was very nice.

A very competent kitchen churns out inventive Cantonese dishes smouldering with wok hei. No misses tonight. I recommend the chicken steamed with bracket fungus and lily flowers. The sweet and sour pork was reinvented with lychee.

I tried the outlet at Thomson plaza level 1. Weekend is very crowded and waiting time for food is a bit long. Week day is ok. I like the hot plate bean curd with egg, San bro venison and vegetables with daced fish. Price is reasonable about $50+. The wintermelon soup is nice too
