What an amazing dining experience!!! Definitely rates among my top ten favourite restaurants of all times. The food was absolutely amazing and the service attentive and knowledgeable. What makes it so special is not only the fresh ingredients, because that's just a given at any Japanese restaurant, but how each dish is prepared with its own sauce or accompaniments. No need to add wasabi or soya sauce. That makes every dish distinctly different. We ate a lot....way too much, and I seriously can't think of any dish that wasn't a standout. By the way it pays to put your fate In the hands of the chef. If you like raw fish for instance tell him to serve what he thinks is best. I promise you won't be disappointed. They also have a great selection of sakis. We had several glasses of different sakis and I am now a converted saki lover. Not a cheap restaurant though...but it was our anniversary and therefore worth every cent we paid

Tucked among a row of japanese restaurants and wine bars facing the main road at Fraser Place Robertson Quay, the restaurant offers a smaller frontage than the rest of its neighbours to spot.One glance at the row of shops, it was quite hard to spot and figure that it is a stand-alone restaurant actually.Staff was very welcoming and Chef was very knowledgeable over what he could do and keen to introduce the best food they have at the moment of visit.Food taste was mediocre. Presentation of dish (tho) was decent.What I didn't like was the constant checks over the shoulder from the staff to see if we have finished our dishes so that they could serve the next. I knew they were trying to keep the sequence right, but it could have been done more delicately. It was just not comfortable to dine with someone constantly strolling behind you. The few patrons who come in after us were also not very pleasant. One came in and stood very very close next to me for quite a long while to check on the fishes displayed in the sashimi fridge and that just irked me. Staff didn't even bother to chat him up and bring him away. If this were to happen at a wet market stall in Bangkok or a Zichar stall under a HDB, I wouldn't have mind. Another came in talking to his female partner at the top of his lung with all the wait staff swarming to him. I suppose he is a regular big spender. So maybe he had that excuse to do so. After all, I only have had spent $200+ at the shop for 2 persons.Nevertheless, the yakitori and sushi were decent. The enoki maki was exceptionally good and very nicely done.The otoro sashimi I would not recommend, as it had this taste of blood still. Being a stinge, I thought, I shouldn't have waste the food and gulped all nevertheless. The purging next day had only myself to blame. I should have asked for a refund...If the management is reading this, I thought they should really watch the way the fishes are being displayed. They are just not very appetizing looking at them laying in a pool of bloody water...It was not a planned visit so I wasn't disappointed much. I just thought the money could have been better spent. Still a long way to go for this one..

I've found this restaurant by chance, since I was looking for a Japanese restaurant close to Robertson's Quay.The place is very small but very nice, one feels that we are back to Japan.The fish is very fresh and the Sushi man very friendly, always trying to serve us well.I must say it was one of the best shushes outside japan that I ever had

I was treated to a Japanese dinner by an old friend who took me to his favourite Japanese restaurant. The food was excellent, fresh with a wide variety of both raw and cooked food. Don't know what to order? Leave it to the chef - omakase... as I did and had the pleasure of enjoying some first time delicious seasonal treats. A must try
