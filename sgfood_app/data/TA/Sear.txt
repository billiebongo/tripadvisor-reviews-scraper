A good resto for reasonably priced set lunch and easy going atmosphere! An easy option and good location!
5
Sear served wonderful steaks at affordable price. It was a birthday celebration and the staff prepared a little surprise to our delight. We had a wonderful meal. The staff provided excellent service and we will definitely come back again!

Awesome set menu for lunch and nicely portioned. A relaxed setting for a business lunch and conducive to private discussions. A nice treat in the city.

View at the top of Singapore Land Tower was ok. A portion of the view was blocked by other tall buildings but this is the CBD after all!
Lunch set menus were very reasonably priced and the ambience was great.

Food was nice tho portions abit small. Wait staff could be more attentive esp when customers arrive...poor reception.

Set lunch was a good deal for the setting and restaurant standard. If you are into the view and atmosphere, it's worth coming. Service generally quick and attentive though somewhat inconsistent (but more about that later). Food - good enough in that you enjoy while you're eating, but won't remember much about it later, other than the pretty food presentation. Wagyu beef was decent but not very fragrant; many better options out there. Crab cake was..well, you can see the crab meat but can't taste the crab. Might be overly high standards having eaten fabulous ones before. New York cheesecake was puny, without the quality to justify its size. Foie gras was the exception - it was melt-in-your-mouth with smooth and rich goodness, and just the right amount of seasoning. Worth the top up on the set lunch price and might be the only thing I could possibly go back for. Service - this is a tricky one. The two male staff we encountered were both welcoming and polite, and quick and attentive. But both the female staff.. The lady who brought us the bill refused to spare a second of eye contact. And the pretty lady at the lift lobby (probably serving both Sear and Angie's) gave a smile along with a cold look like we wouldn't be able to afford a meal there. It's the kind of service not worth kicking up a fuss over, and which can be forgotten if the food had been GREAT, but this left a bad taste that was stronger than the food itself. View - pretty nice, though you would be able to see more if you sat outside (not sure why they allowed smoking outdoors though). At 45th floor it is quite high so you need to look down for a better view - not very convenient when you're seated inside. We've seen better views elsewhere, but most people would enjoy this. Atmosphere inside is not bad too. One interesting thing that marred the experience was the water. As we were sitting down and settling our belongings, we vaguely heard the lady ask "sparkling or still water?" Without thinking much we just replied "still, please". It was only when we heard the sound of a bottle opening that we realized we ended up agreeing to an item we didn't want. We wanted to get drinks instead, but seeing that cursed bottle of Evian on the table left us no mood (or stomach) for other drinks. We felt tricked, although we also knew we were responsible for not being sharper about it. But we were there to enjoy ourselves, not expecting to have to be on our guard. Sure we can afford the $12 water, but that isn't how we would have wanted to spend or fill our stomachs

The lunch set menu was value for money and the food was fantastic. My guest has a fine palate and she was impressed by the foie gras and her main course. She even made the effort to ask for the chef's name as well as SEAR's name card so that she can recommend it to others. The ambience is good, suitable for business meetings and dates.
3
The highlight was probably the Tomahawk & the quiet & beautifully decorated atmosphere. Even though the bone was a bit big but the meat was good. Free corkage too yay to that. The only down points were the shrimp cocktails (small and it was expensive) and the pregnant staff who couldn't wait to chase us out. Mind you the food were slow to be served to begin with. And I felt quite bad for getting her to serve us but she was the only staff that night. But overall we had fun

Was here for lunch with a couple of friends. Wow! The iberico t-bone was sooo good! Tried my friendâ€™s wagyu steak! It was also very very good! The fries were awesome as well! Price ofcourse wont be like what u pay at places lik Astons but i think it is worth it due to the place and ambiance. Place will be good for a romantic dinner as well.
4
We ordered the 3 course set lunch. Good quality ingredients used. Wagyu and the gravy were really good. Definitely recommending it to my mates.
4
The dinner set is value for $ except the food is just so so and with so so presentation..
Service was attentive with nice ambience.
4
Considered one of the great steak servers in Singapore...and yet, we were a little disappointed in the atmosphere, service, and ... have to say ... the meat. Maybe it was an off night.

We made a reservation for a nice end-of-year/anniversary dinner only to get there and find out that there's a massive birthday party going on (we weren't informed beforehand) and they blocked out the entire balcony with the views, which was bummer no. 1, but it was fine if they had stayed out there. Instead, they moved the party indoors and were so loud and noisy it was more disruptive than a hawker center. Luckily, we hadn't placed an order yet so we left. And then the manager(?) tried to offer us a spot at another of their restaurants but we were gonna be allowed to order from SEAR.? It was kinda bizarre to be honest but they tried, I guess. But please, inform your other reservations if there's gonna be a massive party at the same time. When we make a booking at a restaurant like this, we expect a nice quiet romantic atmosphere, not a wet market
4
This is really a good place to go for lunchThey have menu with some decent platesI thinknportion are little too smal for the price but it remains a good place for lunchTherefore overpricedView is quite nice as in middle of raffles place but in high floor.Great place for business lunc

I have been to most if not all the stesakhouse / speak specaility restaurants in singapore. This place was one of the few last ones. I was not expecting much given its location.I came here with friends for late saturday night dinner. Our reservation was for 830pm. The place was surprisingly empty for a sat night I was kind of shocked. We ordered the tomahawk steak, 1.5kg , a few sides - creamed spinach, carmelised onions, mushrooms, cajun seasoned fries. for our appetizer we ordered a shrimp cockail and a salad to share. Appetizer: shrimp cocktail - i think there was about 6-8 shrimps , priced at 16$. A bit steep since the shrimp were no de-veined nor large. it was 6-8 shrimps hung off a Margarita like goblet filled with ice inside with x3 small pieces of lemon mixed into the ice. The prawns had the tail and head left on. Yay or nah? Overall definately nah. Can avoid this dish. The salad - was not bad, good size, not soaked in dressing. Nothing special but not disappointing either. A typical salad to start prior to the steak. The main course: Tomahawk - keep in mind this is a steakhouse and main focusof the restaurant speciality. Done very nicely. Tastes delicious, not too much salt (extra sea salt was placed on the side). Our tomahawk was 1.5 kg however the bone was quite large. The meat was succulent, at medium rare, the fat was apparent/seperated from the meat. We shared the 1.5kg tomahawk amongst 2 guys and 2 girls. In my opinion this is not enough. I would recommend 1.7-2kg esp. if the guys are big eaters.Sides : creamed spinach was good. Mushroom, fries, carmelised onions - average. Nothing to rave about.Service: mediocre at best. The reason why this place doesn't get a 5 star was the service is a let down. Starting from the beginning we were rushed for our orders. There was no warning of when the kitchen was closing and whether or not we wanted to order desserts (as a result we couldnt order desserts). The side dishes came half way through eating the steak. Keep in mind at this point of the night we were the ONLY people at the restaurant and they were not able to keep up.It is a pity that such a restaurant has poor service given its location. The price of the tomahawk was reasonable at 20$/100gm, was very tasty, and I would definitely order it again. With the reasonably price menu, delicious steak, FREE corkage on a Saturday night, not obsessively loud and packed, this is the place to come now! I just hope it doesn't close down! Would have given this place a 5 star if the service was improved on, appetizers were done better, and it didnt close so early (restaurant closed at 11pm
2
The restaurant was not really that full but service is extremely slow. Have to wave for long to catch the attention of the waitress. Main course took a very long time to serve. When I ask for hot milk for my coffee, waitress bluntly told me you need to pay for it as we don’t serve coffee with milk then the milk came at room temperature. Been there several times but I am sure I am not going back with my clients
4
Was there on a Monday early afternoon and was glad I made reservations because it was almost full by the 1pm mark. The outdoor seats and city view was nice and the interior design was really posh and calming. The service was okay. We order 3 2-course lunch sets. Appetizers we got were Garden Medley, Lump Crab Cake & Pira-grilled Foie Gras which were all very pleasant but not mind-blowing or fantasticThe mains we got were Grilled Wagyu, Iberico T-Bone Steak & Fish Of The Day which were all good. The wagyu which was mine had a wonderful flavour however there were tendons in every bite I took which was a tiring journey of chewing and spitting. The fish of the day (salmon) was good but not fantastic or special but my brother said he enjoyed the T-Bone Steak. One thing that I have to say is that I found this place through a food blog and articles that mentioned that this is a very good steakhouse so I came with expectations but I was slightly disappointed at how unsurprising the dishes are. It might also be because I did not try the more expensive steaks which probably were the stars of the restaurant than a $30 lunch set steak. Just a wild guess, who knows. I most likely would not patronize again for the mains as for the price point there are more excellent restaurants
5
Strategic location for business lunch, so easy to find and delicious, fresh and tender steak from this restaurant. By the way, my clients were so impressed with the superb view and there’s a outdoor terrace space in this restaurant. Excellent service and I will go back to this place soon
3
Food were very little portion. I took the salmon but there not enough sauce on it, which made sea taste little too strong. In dessert, i took cheesecake and ice cream. Ice cream was excellent bit cheeesecake was tasteless.When i saw the burger from friends, i regretted for not having taken it:it was consequent and looking yumm
4
This is a great place for a good meal, great service and a good place for a quiet catch-up. The menu is good and has a little something for everyone. Great view as well so don't miss this one. Enjoy.
4
I had a great time having dinner at SEAR. The food and choices were great and to my liking. I enjoyed the view and atmosphere. Would definitely go back.
4
Had dinner with family. Overall for food is average but atmosphere & service is excellent! I love their corn soup.
5
Came many times - service always good. Too bad i can't eat beef, but the non-beef dishes are Delicious as well!
4
The location is located on the 45th floor of Singapore Land Tower. Diners do not have to register to enter as there is an “express” lane to get to the restaurant. The place is spacious but a decent number of tables for people. Reservation is recommended. Ordered a three-course meal including cauliflower soup, wagyu beef burger (I seldom eat beef but their beef were good) and apple pie. My colleagues recommended their crab cake so do try if you are there! I personally like my cauliflower soup but it is a smaller portion compared to the crab cake. Service was pleasant but however when I asked for additional chilli sauce the filipino waitress wasn’t very happy to serve. The rest of the staff were carrying a positive vibe and they made the overall dining experience great :)
5
Had our anniversary dinner here during a weekday night. Was a pretty quiet night with only 1 other occupied table; gave us quite a lot of privacy. We ordered the corn salad to start, with some mushrooms as sides, and for mains we had the tasting Trio and tasting Ribeye. Steak was good, paired well with the red wine, though some parts were either too rich in fat, or were mostly fatty layers. The manager was extremely hospitable and friendly, though the other staff could have been more attentive. All in all a great night

Always been a big fan of Sear, but felt during my recent visit, the place had lost its charm and certainly it's atmosphere. Had the set lunch and felt my expectations were miss managed on the portion size of the steak... as a steak phonetic, this is deemed a cardinal sin!! The meat was tasty but a tiny portion; the side roast veg was cold and felt the massive plate was made to floor full with an excessive amount of chips (very unbalanced when the star should be the steak). The cream Spinach mind you; perfection... well done!! The creamed cauliflower soup was nice, but again very insufficient vs the price of the set menu. Apple Pie dessert was a knockout!! Overall ups and downs. Service is ok, not the most engaging. For me and my guest, it was missing that Friday lunch buzz you would expect in a CBD Steakhouse; everything was a bit flat and subdued. Will give it one more chance, but definitely not how I remember my past dining experiences in Sear
5
I was there for my wedding anniversary and they really gave us their full attention. I felt that the lobster was a bit overcooked and they immediately checked. Later they acknowledged that it was not up to their standards too and waived it off my bill.
5
Celebrated my bf's birthday and I'd asked for a candle on the cake - to our surprise, the extremely hospitable Maitre'D brought out a complimentary slice of cake with ice cream, topped with a sparkler! The steak my bf had was pretty good too. Overall, fantastic service and great atmosphere for quiet dinners.
5
This steak restaurant was suggested by the p.a. of a senior business contact I was hosting and what a great location. Every element - location, food, views (from the balcony) and value for money - was top class. Service in particular was exemplary - quick (great for business lunches, discreet and professional. I'd return in a heartbeat
5
Delicious food with the right ambience and the service is good. Location is at the heart of CBD
We will go there more often.
4
Good restaurant with nice atmosphere, delicious steak and wonderful red wine.. The decoration of the restaurant is awesome.. We felt so comfortable and of course we do enjoyed our dinner time. Staff are helpful/friendly to assist with all of our needs. Welldone !!
5
Sear is a meat lovers paradise with fantastic meats and burgers, complemented with fantastic views from the terrace.
Their pork ribs were out of this world and very highly recommended
4
Good choices of steaks, chicken and fish, following nice starters (see pics) complemented by choice of two desserts for a full meal. Good place for a nice business lunch.
4
Bright & spacious interiors. Crab cake starters are a must try. Mains must try is the wagyu beef burger or beef tartare.
4
Went there for first time for business meet. They serve good selection western dishes. The executive lunch set is great value and good portion to avoid 'food coma' post lunch.The outside verandah area has great view over looking the CBD skyscrapers and the Marin Bay area. Food was good quality.Service wasn't up to par though. Sever dropped spoon on me, waitress that took our orders forgotten about our side dish and we canceled once our mains we finished. Coffee was decent big cuppa, dessert was yumz! We reckon they are overwhelmed with busy lunch time crowd. Guess dinner would be more relaxed and less manic. Overall lunch was good value and tasty.
3
Had lunch set for group of 10, food was tasty but veered towards salty (salt wasn't consistently applied). Service wasn't great for the price range. Decor was slightly dated and looks like it needs a refresh. Will probably never head back. Note, not sure if they do serve ice water but I was served Evian without prompting/checking
4
Had the Scallop Ceviche, Trio Tasting, Bone Marrow, Blue Cheese, Corn on the Cobb, and Creammed Spinach for dinner. Generally good; ambience, view, service and food. The combi of steak with blue cheese will be my fav. The taste was absolutely brilliant! BUT, I wished they had served the steak on a hot stone or hot plate. The steak turned cold midway before I started my 2nd steak. I felt the ceramic plate and it was cold. What a disappointment
4
Nice ambience for small group get-together. We had a corner table and was just perfect and cosy for the group. Weather unfortunately was a bit cloudy, nevertheless that this not mire the view from where we were seated. The beef and chicken set lunch was done just right and the portion was enough for our luncheon. Worth the money for lunch. Will be back again for dinner soon
3
We spent some time locating the lift lobby that leads to the restaurant as there was no proper signage at the building lobby. The restaurant was brightly illuminated by natural lighting from the glass walls, although the skyline views were not great, the tables were adequately spaced out for dining comfort.We ordered 3 sets of 2 course set lunch. The bread rolls were fresh, warm & so delicious that we had to have our second helping. The foie gras appetiser was fairly good & had a nice, crumbly crust but thfruit puree wine reduction didn't quite highlight the foie gras so we ate it as it is. The crab cake was delicious & satisfying without being oily or cloying. We liked the grilled wagyu with sauteed potatoes best, followed by the ribeye. The duck breast was just average in taste, texture & doneness & we didn't like the grilled eggplant/veg accompaniment as we found it very bland & somewhat undercooked.We ended the meal with a good cuppa of boutique coffee.Overall, the grilled wagyu lunch set was fairly good for the price & is worth a revisit
5
We have lunch there, excellent service with excellent food! Be prepared to pay but it is worth it! Years ago I also happen to work with Jones Lang Wootton and this was an office space for our building before Republic Plaza, brought back fond memories!
2
The view is nice. The interior is nice. The service is attentive.
Just the main reason to go to a steakhouse, the steak, was so unacceptable: outside black and burned, inside cold. Perhaps they steak was from yesterday, warmed up a bit.
4
To all visiting , great food , drinks & top notch service , this is definitely a place to visit to experience true Singapore hospitality. Highly recommended. We accidentally came across this wonderful place on one of our night out & it trully transformed my perception of the Singapore hospitality. Sofin & Christian have really made this experience into reality. In fact it is the whole team are as great as well. Definitely a must try. Take the train alight at Raffles MRT & a one minute walk to 50 Raffles place, take the lift to the 45th floor & experience it for yourself. Great food drinks service & a view to die for
5
It's a great spot, up high with indoor and outdoor areas. Even better, great value 2 and 3 course offers with several choices. It seems a little odd how few reviews this place has and in recent months, hardly any. However, it was buzzy on the Friday we visited. $32 for 2 courses in Singapore, I'll be back! The cauliflower soup was delicious. My Wagyu steak lovely. Good wines by the glass and good service. Good stuff!

My wife and I visited this restaurant for Valentine's Day 2017. We booked a table for 8pm. When we arrived at 8pm, we were told the table was not ready. We waited for 45 minutes before being shown to our table.We then ordered two cocktails. The waiter brought my wife the wrong cocktail. Beyond that, while I like a strong drink, both of the cocktails tasted much more like alcohol than anything else.When our bill came at the end of the night, we had been charged for two drinks we did not order. The staff kindly removed them from our bill, but that, coupled with the wait and the awful drinks, was enough to ensure we will NEVER visit this restaurant again.The food was actually pretty tasty. Sadly, I got sick to my stomach later that night, and while I won't blame the food, it was a night I will not soon forget for all the wrong reasons
2
I have reviewed this place twice before in the past, but it is highly unfortunate that this review will vary very much from my previous experiences. It was a shame that there were no more oysters, however the beef tartare was very well done and nicely presented although the meat and cheese platter was nothing special.A lot of effort was put into service, but it was compromised by the waiters inability to differentiate between the different cuts of beef, a problem not present in previous visits. This is detrimental to a steakhouse as a patron would need more information to choose from the various cuts provided.As this information was lacking, we ended up ordering the tasting trio and rib-eye to sample the full range. However the orders were mixed and the waiter insisted that our sirloin cut was a Toriyama ribeye when the apparent lack of marbling made this impossible. It was only after, when the chef came out, that this issue rectified. Sadly our tasting trio was also severely undercooked to the point of being rare (when we requested medium rare) and the pork ribs were too tough to be eaten. Our shrimp cocktail was also forgotten. We appreciated the kind gesture from the chef in providing a dessert platter, however nothing can change my disappointment at the deterioration of my once favorite steakhouse which I made a point to visit on my short holiday back to Singapore. I understand it must be insulting for the chef to experience such negative feedback (a fact made clear by his body language), however I hope that some points can be taken into consideration as I have recommended this place to a few friends but will stop doing so until I come back once again to see if there is any improvement.
4
Went for lunch, interesting environment, not a big fan of restaurants in office blocks, but it was fine. Staff were great. Food (meat) was cooked perfectly, wine list was good and broad enough both in variety and price.Although there are vege options, the specialty is meat and they seem to do it pretty well.Will definitely go back to try some other options off the menu
3
Excellent food accompanied with good ambience to celebrate my wife's birthday on a Thursday night but an ISSUE with a fly found at the bottom of my glass of red wine marred the otherwise good experience. I found a fly in my glass of wine only after I had finished about 2/3 of it as the red wine was dark in colour and the fly was practically undetectable under the dim lighting. I immediately alerted one of the servers.What happened next was really disappointing. After I had informed the only Chinese waitress in black who came to me, she apologised and asked whether I would like the glass of wine to be replaced. Then, she brought my glass to the bartender. What baffled me was how they started smiling and laughing as they spoke to each other in full view of me (What was so funny?). Well, they MIGHT be talking about another matter but it is very unprofessional to be behaving in such a manner immediately after your customer had shown you a fly in the wine, and even more so when your customer is at a close distance watching you.Next, I was served a second glass of red wine but was charged for both the first and the second glasses in my bill without being informed prior to receiving the bill. I do not expect the cost of both glasses to be waived but why should I be paying for ingesting a glass of wine that had a dead fly swimming in it? I paid the bill nonetheless as it was my wife's birthday and I didn't wish to cause too much displeasure on her special day.I am bringing this up even though I have no problem paying for an $18 glass of wine (well the meal easily cost close to 20 times the price).SEAR being a relatively high-end restaurant, should look into its service recovery processes for such an incident. What the restaurant should have done is to waive the first glass or offer a free replacement; or at the very least let the customer know that a second glass would be charged along the with the first if they feel this is reasonable. Also, the service staff should have exhibited more professionalism in front of customers when dealing with such an incident.Overall, I just want to highlight that the service from most of the staff was generally good and attentive; food was also very good; BUT the really poor service recovery and the presence of the fly in my glass have left a bad taste in my mouth at the end of the day. Hence, I probably will not be visiting the restaurant again unless they have decided to fix their customer service

Starting the evening with a Sear Signature cocktail I thoroughly enjoyed a my meal on a Saturday night. As per others views on the atmosphere on a Saturday evening I can concur. It is very quiet on Saturday with only a couple of tables outside and a couple of tables inside being used. On the other hand it does mean an exclusive service for those dining at this typical steakhouse, dark interior restaurant. I had the tasting trio (100gms of each) of tenderloin, the texture of which was almost like butter. The second the excellent ribeye which I felt was the best cut. Finally the striploin which had that extra bit of fat and slightly tougher but still very good. Thick mash potatoes were an average accompaniment.Being service cool/cold onion bread and butter at the start had me worried as I would expect it to be warm which to me is a sign of a first class establishment and freshness in every aspect. Nevertheless the rest of the experience was perfect. Absolutely worth a visit.

i took my partner for a meal here the Saturday night before her birthday. One of reasons I picked this was the nice interior set up seen on website. When we arrived, it was pretty dark though and there were only two other tables being used, and place was lacking atmosphere.However, we did have a nice meal. Scallop ceviche to share as starter was refreshing. My partners Black Onyx steak looked fantastic and I know she enjoyed. I had the Australian wagyu striploin, which was fine although had bit of chewy fat in parts. I have to say though the star of the meal was the mushrooms with rosemary and thyme which were fantastic. Also had the chunky mash which was fine.So, I think the food is worth a recommendation, of course the view on the balcony is good, I would just suggest that you go during a weekday evening or maybe lunch when the place is busier with more atmosphere. We also went next door to Empire afterwards for post meal drink which is a decent bar (very reasonable prices (for Singapore) and good views
4
Had the set lunch which was very delicious and good value. You can choose to have the two course or three course lunch. The steak was done according to our requests and the potato cubes were wow!!
Cosy ambience.
4
My visit this time was overall a pretty good experience, with a good quiet atmosphere, value for money steak and decent house pour. I had half a dozen Fine de Clair oysters and Foie Gras as an appetizer this time round, oysters were a bit small but quite fresh. The Foie Gras was a perfect blend of sweet and salty, both beautifully complementing each other; unfortunately, it was a bit overcooked resulting in a dry crumbly texture. Next up was the rib-eye tasting platter. Although the angus and the wagyu had a lot of tendon in it, the waiter was kind enough to replace it for me. I also ordered a side of truffle egg which was quite interesting with the steak. The Toriyama was as usual, a very nice cut. The Cabernet Sauvignon was one of the most decent house pours I've had at a restaurant, definitely a value for money to pair with the steak. The chunky mashed potatoes are also worth a try, nice to have in between bits of steak, not too salty or overpowering. I was sad to hear that the previous manager had moved to boathouse, he was quite knowledgable about the different steaks and wines that was sold there and definitely made our meals more enjoyable.
2
We went here on new years eve paying a considerable amount for an a la carte buffet meal then on to the club next door. Whilst most of the food was good, our mains of steaks came out completely cold and we waited an additional 20 minutes for my wife to get her main once we'd all finished ours. Which leads me to the main issues. The service was shocking. We waited a very long time to be asked for drinks, we weren't given a full drinks menu and when we did order, we waited a very long time for these drinks to be given to us. From the time we arrived it had taken one hour to be served our first drink. This happened consistently throughout the night and we were given hardly any attention/service throughout. By the time we had finished the mains it was well gone 11 so we had to have dessert in the viewing gallery so we didn't miss the fireworks.The place wasn't even fully booked but they clearly didn't have enough staff. We ALWAYS had to ask to be waited, we were never waited upon. At the end of the night, they gave us a glass of champagne each and did take a little bit off the bill, but we still paid over $250 each and for that price we expected far better, hence the poor score
3
We had dinner here on Saturday night with a group of friends. I'd eaten here once before for lunch and the place was half empty and lacking atmosphere. Unfortunately it was the same for dinner. The restaurant was 3/4 empty. To be fair this could have been due to the haze which affected the view and has kept a lot of people at home. The food was alright, the selection of steak is ok but the range and quality of the finished product was not as good as you would get at Morton's.It was good to try and I'm sure the view would have been great without the haze but the selection and quality of the food for the price was not great.
4
High atop an office building in Singapore I had an enjoyable lunch at Sear. The Mozzarella & Tomato salad was wonderful. I followed it with a perfectly cooked steak. This was in a 2 choice menu or could be made a 3 choice adding desert. Great place for a business lunch with a bright atmosphere and views of the city
5
Handsomely furnished restaurant equipped with leather couches, dark wooden paneling and metal interiors gives sense of cosy sophistication feeling throughout. The outlet manager Mr. Kevin was very kind & helpful with recommendations of wagyu steaks & wine pairing selections. The steak was juicy, flavourful finished with a golden crust. Overall a relaxing and wonderful place to dine. We'll definitely be back for the 5 star hospitality this restaurant offers
5
I had a great time there during my last visit. I had lunch there some time back and the food there is fantastic. I had the steak and they don't just look good, they taste awesome. Service was top notch and the manager on duty was very attentive to our needs. Kudos to the Sear team
5
There are surprisingly few good, reliable steakhouses around the Raffles Place business district so Sear has been a great addition to the local restaurant scene. The location on 45/Floor of Singapore Land Tower is super convenient. I've hosted business lunches here about once a month since it opened and always had a great experience.The view is fantastic, and I often walk my guests around the open air balcony so they see Marina Bay on one side and Raffles Place on the other before or after lunch. The two house specialities of steak with truffle flavoured fries, and the Wagyu Burger are both delicious.The desserts are also great - especially the chocolate mud pie.The business lunch set, which comes with a good number of choices is superb value.Last but not least the amazing greeter, Jessica never fails to make the guests feel special and welcome, remembers names, and does a great job of creating that "wow" factor with first impressions as she greets and leads you to your table.Arguably the best western restaurant in the RP area and definitely the best value for such a high quality dining experience
1
Went for a lunch with a business associate. The place was more than half empty but they refused to accommodate a request for change in table. And it was as empty when we left an hour later. We had a set lunch - the food was ok but the staff was awfully unfriendly and rude without a reason especially the one who acted like the chief. Horrible experience - there are much better places at the same cost around the area. Don't even bother 
4
Only come here for the beef. Swami, one of the staff, was well versed in the many different steaks available and recommended the Toriyami, a definite must try. He was also very friendly and accommodating.Would recommend this place to any steak lovers
4
The restaurant is on the rooftop. You can enjoy a beautiful night view while having a fancy dinner here.
5
the best place for pre-party dinner and if you want to impress your clients for lunch. bring them here

It was our anniversary, and my husband decided to book a table at Sear Steakhouse for a candle light dinner while watching the fireworks.Since the oyster bar and steak house were linked together, we had a chance to go around, enjoyed the panorama view and chose the best spot to watch the ndp rehearsal. If you want to celebrate the SG50 Saturday but are pulled back by the thought of being in the big crowd, hit by the heat and stucked in the jam, this IS the recommended place for you and your family.Can't talk about the restaurant without mentioning its foods and service. We ordered the corn soup - sounds ordinary, but the taste was surprisingly good. Our main course was Beef Tasting Trio, which gave us a chance to taste 3 different types of beef (well... I'm not a beef connoisseur before, but now i can tell which part of the cow i love the most haha...). The beef came with a few different sauces, enhanced the taste much better. Its truly worth the price The best part of the night is the service. We were served by a young man named Long. He demonstrated a great understanding of different steak (i did learn this from him) and gave good recommendation of what we should order. He was very dedicated with his service while still gave us enough privacy for our talk. Together with his team, they showed us their professionalism with great smile and heart warming care.I definitely gonna come back here again! Maybe in a weekday to try their promotion

This restaurant is relatively new and therefore, there weren't many patrons when we went there on a Saturday night. It was a perfect place for a romantic night out. Amazing view. Private and quiet and no loud music blaring in the restaurant. Steak was perfect. The sides were mediocre - nothing to write home about. We felt that the dining chairs could have been better - they were a bit off and didn't match the rest of the upscale decor.

I have since been twice to this restaurant, and both times have been thoroughly enjoyable experiences. I'm sure both myself and my guests will definitely be back again soon.The first time I tried Sear was at a Bridal Shower I had organised for my cousin. The manager Swamy was incredibly accommodating and provided wonderful, prompt service throughout the evening. Upon his recommendation, we ordered the scallop cerviche, crab cakes, lobster cobb salad and bone marrow to start. These appetizers were a few highlights from the menu and provided a delicate and delicious opening to the meal. For the main event, Swamy had also reserved three generously portioned Porterhouse steaks that arrived on sturdy wooden boards. Slightly charred and caramalised on the outside, with its juices glistening across its surface, these held high promise and delivered. The steaks were superb. They were robust, hearty and incredibly rich in flavour. Furthermore, their texture was succulent, buttery, yet lean, and maintained the structure of flavour throughout their cut. Their flavour was also enhanced by the selection of sauces (ponzu, bone marrow, peppercorn) we had ordered to accompany the steaks. The sides of familiar favourites (mac and cheese, fries, rosti to name a few) were unpretentious and generously portioned, providing a delicious accompaniment to the meal. Needless to say, the meal went down incredibly well. Not only was the food flavourful but also boasted distinct quality. I have since had the pleasure of being back again and am happy to testify to the overall quality and pleasure of dining at Sear

A group of us came here on a Tuesday night and the place was only about 20% full. Let me start by saying that I don't think that this is one of the better steak restaurants in Singapore (there seems to be a lot opening recently ) but they certainly are charging top prices. Bone marrow for entree was over powered by the sauce that was literally drenched on it. I think it would have been much nicer had it just been served with garlic and bread. The mains I tired the sear ribeye platter (3 different types of beef) and this was decent. I would recommend this if you want to have a bit of variety rather than just having 1 cut of beef. I also tried the Kobe beef (it's not cheap at around $350 I recall) and that was nice but even at medium rare I think it was over cooked so rare might be better if you are trying that. The wine list was alright but I was very surprised that they did not have any dessert wine. Service was alright but given the size of the place and location (top of the SLT in the cbd of town) I would think that if these small things are not addressed then this might not be around for much longer in its current form.

The food is decent and better than most restaurants at Raffles Place.The steak is very good but expensive. The steak for the set lunch is not as good but it is cheaper.There is not much of a view as part of the view if blocked off

Had lunch with some clients and colleagues. Had the 2 course set lunch and shared some sides. Started with the octopus which was rather good. Had the steak and fries for my main course. The steak was done medium rare as I requested and it was tasty and succulent. The sides were unspectacular except for the wedges with duck fat which was a hit at the table.The service was a little disappointing. Had to frequently request for refills of water.Retry decent place for a business lunch with good value
