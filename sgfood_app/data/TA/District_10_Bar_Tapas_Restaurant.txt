Great burgers and beer. Nice place to chill out with tapas and beer promotion. Servers can get a little busy to notice you though.
Conveniently located next to the metro/train station.

Revisited the place for my favorite tapas. To my surprise the menu has changed. Ordered a soft shell chilli crab pizza and was very good!
4
Had a group lunch with buddies. The food was good. The fries were a little bit oily though. Unfortunately, they were staffed with students on holiday job. They had no idea about the menu items. Anyhow, they were quite helpful.

Love the ambience and good service during my visit, the steak is really good, I'll definitely visit this place again!
4
Overall good experience jus that price is on e high side. District 10 and seafood basil pizza were good. Crab cake was normal. Hope that the indoor air con can be stronger and faster food serving rate.
3
The air con for this restaurant needs to improve badly. The indoor & outdoor temperature feels the same so if you think sitting Indoor is cooler ........ you are WRONG. Food is average, no big wow factor so it's an "ok" place for after office gathering but if you are looking for nice tasting food, you are better off somewhere else

We booked a table in advance before a show at the theatre. They were well aware it would be busy, but were completely understaffed. It took forever to get served and to pay the bill. As a wine bar, they did not have the house suav blanc or pinot noir available by the glass! - and the staff took 10 minutes to come back and tell us -, the food was cold and greasy (note: it's not even close to "tapas"), and the whole experience was disappointing. While the few wait staff who were there were working hard, they could have done a lot better with customer service (a smile costs nothing), and the blame squarely falls on management for not having enough people at the front during a predictably busy night and ensuring decent chefs in the kitchen. Will not be back

There were 4 of us. We ordered Fish & Chips, it was of a very poor quality taste. The beer batter was bitter and soggy, filled with oil. We also ordered tapas - the onion rings was good, the soft shell crab was lousy and quesadillas was average. We also ordered chicken skewers - this was the nicest amongst all the food we ordered. The only time we experienced good service was when we were ordering. After that, we had a tough time getting the waiting team's prompt service. For example, asking for a glass of wine took more than 30 minutes! There is no reason to return to this place unless we are just looking for a place to chill.

Dark and side door don't work. Place don't look so clean and maintained. Ordered coffee and the sugar served were all ruined by humidity. Even the canister holding the sugar packs were rusty. I'll maintained. And it's not super cheap. Though portion looked big. Good for group gathering or people without much expectation. They need to clean up and maintain the place more. Start with the sugar. All the packs brought in different cannister were wet n stuck inside like glu

Decided to recce for a nice place to have a meal around Buona Vista when we chanced upon District 10... No regrets! The food was really good as we ordered the burger and pasta plus with the happy hour, the drinks were affordable. Service was good too as they were very attentive
5
The lunch time deals are great. Regular portions at pocket friendly prices. We tried the chicken chop, pork chops and pizza. Prices start at $9.90 (GST inclusive). A drink is included. Their fries taste great.
4
I like their happy hour here, and my friends and I enjoy the abmience which is a cross between pub and lounge!
5
Great place for a quick get together with friends or colleagues. Excellent service with a good menu selection.
4
Food is good, price reasonable, convinient location, service was not that good though but still acceptable, atmosphere is good.
3
Good food, but so so service. We personally like softshell crab with chilli crab sauce pizza even tho it was a little messy.

I had made a reservation on the 1st of September via Chope as I had wanted my in laws to try it out. Reservation went through and so we proceeded to head to Star Vista.When we got there imagine our shock to see it CLOSED. As I thought that I made the reservation at the wrong outlet I proceeded to go online to their website to check - which clearly states that they're open Sundays and PUBLIC HOLIDAYS - which it was on that day (Hari Raya Haji).So the following day I contacted the one at Suntec as no one seemed to be picking up at the Star Vista one. And was told that they close on public holidays. Really? Whomever spoke to me said that she'd get someone to call me back but have not gotten a call till today. Kudos to your management team for not disabling Chope and also for losing a return customer. And for the false info on your website

We had a staff birthday celebration here and it turned out to be a really nice, private celebration. The food and the ambiance were good. The Margherita pizza was excellent. Fritto Misto Platter was not a disappointment too! Family with young children would need to be careful as they displayed a lot of wine bottles around the restaurant.
4
Perhaps it was because it was a weekday night, but the restaurant/bar was quite empty. Depending on your point of view, that could be a good thing (for a quiet gathering) or a bad thing (for an energetic rave). In any case, service was prompt and attentive as would be expected, and the food was more than decent. We both had their signature District 10 burger. Juicy, generously-sized, skillfully finished beef patties with veggies and fries. Definitely give it a try
4
It is literally located in a quiet corner of the Star Vista. Nice place to hang out. You could tell that it is being run lovingly because despite the fact that it is a bar, it looks clean and neat. Happy hour drinks at $6.
3
Went with my friend who had a 1-for-1 pizza deal here. We ordered the 2 pizzas, a glass of Cab Sauv from their $6 Monday Madness deal and tap water. We immediately noticed that the establishment was short-staffed this Monday, and there was 1 pizza maker doing his best to rush everyone's orders out. We waited more than 45 minutes for our pizza, and the waitress we had completely ignored us or forgot to get back to me on our query on food. The manager apologized to us for the slow service. The pizza was great though! I sincerely wish I did not have to wait that long for it. Despite it being a Monday, the place was full. You must book a table, as the folks who walked in got seated much later than we did

My sister and I had a late lunch somewhere close by, and ended up having happy hour drinks at this spot. It was casual, relaxed and we had their house red. A great spot to just chill and have a conversation.
5
Staff was very friendly throughout our meal. Food portion was pretty decent. Had the fish and chips, which has good fries. And crab meat pasta, which has lots of crab meat in it. Worth the price.
4
It's quite cozy place to have a draft beer. Its price is quite reasonable due to happy-hour promotion. Food is quite okay.
4
A group of us went for dinner last night. The food variety and quality was pretty satisfying for our group. I would Recommend this place. Drinks n food menu was pretty varied.
4
We enjoyed the Angus beef burger. It was very nice, flavorful and juicy. Service staff were pleasant too.
5
Had their burgers. Oh my! Delicious!!!! Service was excellent too! Totally enjoyed the trip there. Will definitely pop by again.
4
This is a good place for good food served in a Tapas style. There were not many servings that would be served in Barcelona but it was good and the staff was friendly. I had the mini burgers with fried mushrooms. Go before 8pm to get the 2for1 deal on wine
3
Went there on a weekday lunch time. Only 4 groups of patrons. This place is really quiet despite the good businesses at other eateries at star vista. It's right in front of the taxi stand. And I personally feel it's the average quality food and the high prices. They may want to look into sharing their food on social media more to get people more interested. The food is really mediocre. The chicken Karaage I had was prolly from some frozen packet $8++ the chicken quesadilla was so-so $12++ but the grilled pork chop was the only highlight of the meal $22++ juicy and well seasoned. The staff were friendly, there was only 1 wait staff and 1 bar staff. There's free wifi too!

We tried out District 10 Bar Tapas Restaurant before going to a pop concert (Fifth Harmony, fantastic!). Unfortunately, the food at this restaurant was pretty much inedible. The ingredients weren't fresh, very greasy, and terrible in every way. We left feeling queasy. We will never go back
4
Done my reservation via Chope, straight forward process. Visited during Wednesday dinner time, barely any crowd, so finding a good spot is easy. Ambiance is pretty nice, good place to chill out and relax after a long day of work.Had the Angus beef burger for my wife and myself as I was using voucher redemption. Didn't add on any starters nor desserts as the price range is way over what we were normally used to.Thankfully, the food was great. The patty was done right (medium rare as per requested), and still full of flavour. Generous serving of fries and salad too. Base on the full price menu, this item is probably the most worthy ($22)
4
It was off-peak hours and I had the pleasure of speaking to the staff. Service was prompt and friendly. I would definitely go back for drinks.
5
Nice ambience, good happy Hour prices (1 for 1). Bar is located at a quiet corner as well.
Order their truffle fries and pizzas!!!
4
Happy Hour for non-wine all night long. Superb pizzas and tapas. Fish and chips were good. The ribeye should have been better. Nice ambience.
5
Food was fantastic. Servers were fast n friendly. Nice ambience.
Was there couple of times to celebrate birthdays n meet ups with friends n it nvr disappoints me!
4
Food very nice! Pork Belly Pizza very special. I love their pizza and i enjoy my selection of lunch set there.
3
Great location for meet ups, especially with large groups coming from all over the island. Service was great even at peak hours, we had a very thoughtful hostess
4
table reserved at a good place for a quiet chat and it's indoor which is not hot. Food are alright thou.
5
There was literally no waiting. I was served to my table immediately. The whole process was a breeze. I got the menu, they left me undisturbed. Once I made up my mind, they served me promptly and took my order. The food did not take long to be served and both dishes that i have ordered tasted awesome! Thank you for having me
3
The food was alright but the place was so empty. 20 odd tables only 3 were occupied during lunch. The lunch sets are $15 nett onwards for fish and chips. Not a bad deal but the food isn't that great either. I would eat here if I didn't have any other choice. The pork belly pizza was okay. The pork belly was soft and the thin crust pizzas was alright. Nothing fantastic. The staff was attentive despite being one man taking care of everything but seeing how empty the shop is, there's really not a lot of customers to wait on. I wish their food prices would be more reasonable as the food isn't that great. Okay food for expensive prices
1
The worst service imaginable. People were chasing after servers to order. Picked up their own food. Could not get drinks. It only took 25 minutes to get our check. No more District 10 for this family. We watched others experience this terrible service. Very, very sad
3
Ribs are nice and portion is just right. Good service from the waitresses. Aircon not working well as feeling a bit warm inside the restaurant.
4
Wide variety of dishes with all sorts of meats - perfect for groups who are of diverse diets. Excellent service as well. Not crowded, which was a huge plus
5
very cheap set lunch and good food! the tom yum soup was surprisingly nice for a restaurant that is specialising in italian food.
5
The food was okay. The happy hour 1 for 1 promotion was good. The service was okay, it was difficult to request for assistance due to our seats. And the waitress wasn't fully clear about the menu and promotion
1
We showed up at the tapas bar for a snack 30 minutes before closing. The kitchen was closed so we ordered wine and beer which came quickly, but the request for nuts or anything solid to go with the drinks - like you would get in any good bar - was flatly denied.Five minutes before closing time, the server showed up with a handful of disposable plastic cups and proceeded to transfer our expensive wines and beers into them. When we complained, she grudgingly poured them back, spilling quite a bit. The manager was called, but he did not understand why we complained about disastrous service. We are not going back there anytime soon

We came here late in the afternoon on a Saturday for a few drinks. There were only 2 tables occupied, including ours which was a table of 7. We ended up just sitting and chatting as no one served us even after 15 minutes. I had to call out to the waitress who was fiddling around with a screen just 5 meters away from our table (she was so near yet did not take the initiative to ask us whether we were ready to order). We ordered drinks that were 1 for 1 on happy hour. I ordered an Asahi pint while my friend ordered a Corona bottle, which on the advertised menu, complete with a photo of a Corona bottle, clearly was on a "1 for 1 ALL DAY" special. When the waitress came to deliver the Corona my friend mentioned the 1 for 1 deal to which she replied with a confused look saying Corona's are not 1 for 1. My friend pointed to the advertised photo saying yes it says so on here. The waitress still refused to acknowledge they were 1 for 1 all day and said she will need to confirm with the manager and get back to us. We were very confused as to why something so clearly written needed further confirmation. They did come back saying yes Coronas were indeed 1 for 1 all day but this was all a bit of an inconvenience to us who wanted to enjoy some drinks in peace without any unnecessary confusion. We ordered some tapas which were not bad.However the poor service in relation to promptness in attending to a seated table, and not knowing the menu will be reason enough for me not to return. Definitely not worth the 10% service charge they impose

We all went from office on a Friday. We had a gala time. Ordered two towers of Asahi beer. I had it first time and liked it. The food options are good. Beware that Nachos do have some sause with Beef in it.It was friend's party. We absolutely and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location is good, Buona vista mrt is walkable. Ambience of restaurant is good. Service is reasonable. Can accommodate large groups. Found ppl with kids and family on other tables. Overall, recommended with return for sure some time later

It has been 3 years since we last visited this place. There were less than 4 tables (including ours) occupied and 6 staff around. However all of them were gathering at the counter and we had to flag for their attention for a while to place order. The drinks were alright. However the pizza served was cold. Again we had to flag for their attention and none came to us. We had to walk to the counter to get ALL of their attention. Then they walked over to help us reheat the pizza. One of the staff came with the heated pizza and said it was because we were seated under the fan that the pizza turned cold. We told her to touch this new pizza that it was hot. She walked away. Another lady came over and apologized saying that the pizza was brought to us late and hence it had turned cold. Subsequently, we had ordered ice cream since we were still chilling at the place. The ice cream had melted by the time it reached our table. To be honest, I was very much disappointed with the services rendered and the quality of food. To think we had such great time at this place 3 years and we had patron the place almost weekly. Anyway, it will be the last time we stepped into this place.

Had a late lunch (last order for lunch was about to be over but they made it for us). Had set lunch. Quality: GoodTaste: AveragePrice: GoodService: GoodAtmosphere: GoodDo take note: If you are looking for the famous pasta on chese wheel, head to UE Sq
4
Nice food based on experience from suntec and UE Square. But seems suntec had slightly different menu for food..
3
Overall the food is decent but it seems it is lacking of service staff. Order taking & servicing can be quite a pain..
5
Strongly recommend their Grilled Angus Beef Cheddar Cheese Burger.
I also tried their garlic prawns, clear that is was frozen, as it tend to lack in 'taste'.
desserts seems abit on the higher priced.
3
The burger is really nice. The chicken wasn't really cook so I didn't eat it. The lunch set portion is big and the price is good.
4
There was a monday promo on the beers and wine and to top it off a one for one snacks for every glass of wine ordered.
4
Finally tried District 10 after hearings about it a while ago, not too bad a place for after-work dinner and drinks with colleagues/friends. The thin crust pizza with iberico ham was good! As was the duck spring rolls and fried white fish.
4
Good food, service and ambience. Nice place to bring family. Very friendly service. Good value 1-for-1 promotions.
4
Not a bad place for drinks and snacks. Happy hour promotions were good. Music was not really heard. Would be good if there was a live band.
5
This place is so easily accessible by MRT and other mode of transports. Not only does it provide an ample space for parking but the staff at this place, was way beyond cool. The food served was great and most importantly of all, the drinks they had to offer, were great for the occasion

I went there in the middle of the week to celebrate a birthday and catch up with friends. We ordered from the one-for-one tapas menu and also from the main menu. The food was excellent and the staff allowed me to try a sip of the wine before I chose as I was looking for something light and sweet, and wasn't familiar with the wines on their list. I thought it was very nice of them to offer, as I rarely encounter mid-range restaurants and bars that do that. We wanted to order a slice of cake for the friend who was celebrating her birthday and our server was very helpful - she recommended the cheesecake and put a candle on it.I would definitely go back there again and hope to be served by the same server; I noticed that a couple of the other (younger) staff were not as service-oriented (they tend to not-catch your eye despite someone waving at them, and were not as pro-active in their response).Thanks for a great evening out

I made reservation for late lunch/ early dinner @ 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon after a KTV session nearby. I chose this place because there is a Chope promo of 25% off food orders. Upon arriving, we were informed that the chef was not around and any food that required cooking was not available. We could only order salad and pizza (presumably microwavable). The staff even commented that it is common practice for restaurants not to serve food when it is not meal time. However, I find this to be unacceptable as the restaurant is located in a mall and it is weekend. It should have been highlighted upfront on Chope's website and/or the unavailable timings should be blocked off from accepting reservations. Notwithstanding, since there was a happy hour promotion for beer, we stayed on for a couple of drinks. Since we were not able to order cooked food (salads don't go with beer and pizza had too much carbs!), I had to go to the fast food outlet few units away to pack some chicken wings. However, the staff was very inflexible and refused to let us consume the food in their premise. I explained that I wanted to order the wings but they did not have it. Overall, I am disappointed that I did not get to enjoy the Chope promotion for this reservation and I had to miss my lunch. We left after the drinks to grab dinner elsewhere

The menu probably needs a little revamp as the pictures are quite small. Portions are ok but tapas prices seemed a little on the higher end. Good place for gathering.
3
Average all round except good value in drinks on a Monday. Can't think of many better ways to do away with any monday blues
5
Very good service and food, especially recommend the chicken wings and seafood pizza. Also the promotion 1 for 1 wine is worthy.
5
Excellent ambience, good delicious thin crust pizzas.. good 1-for-1 pizza deals (dec), great service from friendly staff..
5
the food was great and the service was very quick. the restaurant has a nice feel to it and has very nice lighting.
4
Nothing comes cheap in Singapore! So to get a Black Angus burger and a beer for $16 gotta say great burger and great price!
3
This is my third time at District 10. Unfortunately, it seems that the standard of the food has dropped since the first two times I was there. For a place that specialises in tapas, it's surprising that the Pizza tasted better than any of the tapas we ordered. Otherwise, service crew were friendly and ambience was conducive for a conversation among friends.

We went to the branch at the VISTA on Valentine's Day for dinner. We came away with a bad note in our mouth. The food was very average, though the pizza was reasonably tasty. The dessert had to be returned because the ice creams were not fresh and tasted like it has been frozen and defrosted many times. But what really jarred us was the service.At the end of the evening we were asked if we had any last order or drinks. We ordered another round of drinks. Then before we could finish that drink, we were told to move to the outdoor section as the indoor area was closing. So we moved to the outside benches with our drinks. Barely able to finish that last drink, the waitress came and ask if she can decant our drinks into plastic cups as the staffs were leaving. We are really upset by this. Firstly it's a drink place. If they were unable to service us till we finish our drink they shouldn't have asked us for another order of drinks. And to ask us to decant into plastic cups was just so like what I expect a secondary school tuck shop would do, not a place like that at the VISTA. What if we were drinking wine? With plastic cups???Needless to say we would never visit their outlets again, not recommend anyone to come. Disappointed.
4
My wife and I went there for dinner. We shared an excellent duck salad and very good pork brochettes. The crab cakes were so-so. Not very tasty and difficult to handle, breaking up in little pieces as soon as you try to pick up a piece of it. It was happy hour time so I had two beers for the price of one and my wife had two glasses of wine for the price of one (although these were small glasses).Overall a good meal and a good evening in a relax atmosphere outside the Star Vista Mall
4
Pizza was great, alio olio was awesome. Hot kitchen only opens after 1800 hrs, before 1800 hrs only some simple tapas and pizza available.the atmosphere was cozy, as more crowd came by for their happy hour during the evening time. A good place for chill-out with friends after work
