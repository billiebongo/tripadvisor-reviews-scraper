The buffer dinner in Momoya Japanese has certainly dropped as compared to last year. Taste on most of their food are very bland . Not worth eating there

Had their sushi and sashimi dishes. Really fresh and tasty. Even the wasabi is nice and spicy! Nowadays the wasabi from other restaurants are disappointing. Cheese toufu was excellent! Will be coming back again. Buffet is good value.

Momoya Japanese Restaurant has nice buffet with quality food. Price is not too bad considering the selection you can have,

Yup. A little know secret of us living in the east. This place is good and relaxing for our regular japanese meals. Food is good and served fast, service team attentive (but wished they smile more).

Was apprehensive when I read PToh55 review a just before my visit on Sunday. But decided to go anyway since I have already made a booking and I promised my kids to bring them to a Japanese Buffet .I must said ehat I encountered was totally opposite to what PToh55 encountered. The food qualities were great..the staff very attentive ...when my sons drop their chopsticks ...a replacement were immediately offered to them.Food came quick promptly and the waiting staff was patience and even recommend some dishes for us to order.Overall, it was a very out experience and will definitely head their again when our Japanese food craving comes along again.Thumbs up!!!

Booked for our family of four. Restaurant has an unassuming façade. Buffet was ala carte style, i.e. you order what you want on their very extensive menu. Can't praise the food quality enough, especially the sashimi. For the price of the buffet, I would consider this excellent value for money. Big thumbs up

We went here for the lunch buffet today (14 may 2016) and the food here is nice. Here is just some pictures that I've taken and the rest of the food pic are on my snapchat . Well I give this restaurant a 5 star because the food taste SUPERBLICIOUS and the portion of the food given is sufficient Next the staff are also friendly so it deserved a 5 star rating.

Finally got to try Momoya after saying in the East of Singapore for more than 10 years. Went on a Monday evening and was surprise that the waitress asked if I have made reservation and the entire restaurant was very empty. Their menu is pretty strange, they have got set menu, buffet menu and a la carte menu and you cannot find teppanyaki on a la carte June or set menu, it is only in the buffet menu! I ordered set bento and chawamushi. I was shock that my chawamushi was actually smaller serving than my green tea cup...... Fine, because it's very cheap after all. While enjoying my chawamushi, one of the waitress came over and serve my bento, and cleared my chawamushi even before I realized! It was long gone! And I'm not even done yet! She just took it off the table without asking. Then I was served miso soup, without spoon, and again, I had to request for one. My entire dinning experience lasted for 1.5hours, they only came to refill my green tea once, and I had to ask them to refill please, where entire time there's only 7 tables occupied which is all in all no more than 20 customers......... I remember passing by the restaurant long time ago and seeing queue and large crowd in the restaurant, but I'm sure with such service standard, no customers will want to visit again. And for myself, first and last

went to friend’s house in the east again to watch wimbledon finals between djokovic & federer on 6.7.2014.we decided to go another place for dinner. we had been going to east coast lagoon food village the last few times. 1 friend suggested momoya at jalan pari burong.must say they have very good & inexpensive sets here. momoya also serves ala carte buffet, S$31++pax for lunch & S$35++pax for dinner (same buffet menu).1 friend ordered the tempura & udon set. the tempura moriawase included 3 prawns, i guessing 1 fish & 2 vegetables. i tried 1 prawn, it was ok, the batter just average not so great.another friend & i ordered the sushi & sashimi set. there were 12 pieces of sashimi - 4 slices each of salmon, maguro (tuna) & hamachi (yellow tail). salmon was very good, comparable with sun with moon at wheelock & might be better than or about same as chikuwatei. hamachi & maguro were quite standard, probably about same as chikuwatei not as good as sun with moon wheelock. the 6 pieces of sushi were pretty good quality – salmon, maguro, kajiki, eel, amaebi & ebiko. the set included soup & chawamushi (very average not great). at S$17++ for 12 pieces of sashimi & 6 pieces of sushi of above average to good quality, it was really good value for money.we added 2 upsized portions of sashimi. this was same as the sashimi in the set except that there were 3 slices each so total 9 pieces sashimi for just S$5.i would say the sashimi was about comparable with chikuwatei so S$17 set for 18 pieces was a much better deal than the S$25++ chirashi don at chikuwatei, and adding the upsize 9 pieces sashimi, it was just S$22++. the sashimi were good enough that greedy me enjoyed the overdose of 27 pieces for just S$22++. the S$20++ chirashi don set at ginza kuroson offered better quality sashimi but portion wise would be 1/2 this mount.i would do this again when visiting my friends in the east. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/07/07/great-value-sushi-sashimi-bento-dinner-momoya-on-6jul2014
