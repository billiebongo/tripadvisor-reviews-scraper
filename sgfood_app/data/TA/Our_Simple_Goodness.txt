We stumbled upon OSG because I was looking to dine at Suntec City - my app booking recommended this place, so reservations were made. At first, we were a little apprehensive when we first stepped in. The unassuming glasshouse bar looked close from the outside - when we stepped in, it was relatively quiet, although there were diners at several tables. We proceeded to place our orders, and the server was patient and friendly, and took the trouble to explain the menu to us. We decided to be adventurous, and ordered a Mala Spicy Chicken Noodle dish... as well as a chicken tikka pizza. The noodles were a nice surprise - the sichuan peppercorn addded a nice touch to the fragrant, crispy chicken. Although the noodles could be a tad saltier, the combination worked well, and my business partner and I were pleased with the dish. The pizza is nothing to write home about, although the crust is crispy but the toppings were a little scarce. We deduced it was probably frozen crust, although the toppings were fresh. For a bar/pub environment, we weren't expecting to be blown away by the food...so it was nice that 1 out of 2 dishes surpassed our expectations. We were curious about the queues that started forming around the nasi padang booth (Indonesian/Malay rice dishes), and decided we might come and try it another time.We did - a week later, and brought another business partner along. The food was excellent value, and although service was a bit slow, the server was friendly and efficient, when she attended to us.The takeaway menu is extremely good value, and even includes a drink. This makes it equivalent to food court prices, and those don't even come with drinks!We'll definitely be going back again at some point... probably for an evening out when we want to chill at the bar. Bar prices are extremely affordable, since alcohol prices tend to be ridiculous at clubs.So far, our lunch experiences have been pleasant, and we're thrilled to have found a good hide out with less crowd during the busy rush hour at lunch (probably because most people don't head out of the mall during lunch time, and this glasshouse building sits outside the mall). This place is still a well-kept secret, and that's probably one of its many charms
