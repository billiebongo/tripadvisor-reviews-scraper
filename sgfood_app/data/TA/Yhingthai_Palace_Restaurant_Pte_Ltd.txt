Amazing fresh food, be careful with your western tongue as spice means spice.
Make sure you turn up 8:30pm / 9pm at the latest as all restaurants close at 9:30 sharp.
Nice atmosphere, amazing food

Nice restaurant serving a good variety of thai food. Also like the layout as it is spacious and kid friendly.

Was looking for authentic Thai food and decided to try this relatively long established restaurant. The red ruby dessert saved the day. Best I have had in Singapore. The main dishes was OK, not outstanding. Service staff could be better trained.

Went to Yingthai for my daughter’s Birthday. Food standard is high, service
Is very good and ambience is conducive .

From photos of interior that are on here are old. They've remodeled the interior and is much prettier. Light brown wood table with Camel leather seats. It's probably best to put reservation in...because when I showed up there was 90% of tables already reserved. Clean and sleek.This place, as I was eating became very very busy.They take your order using a small tablet...so pretty high-tech.I ordered mineral water. 2 spring rolls. Liked the thicker spicier soy dipping sauce, but they could've put more in small dish. I ordered Chicken phad Thai for main course. Decent portion size. They didn't bring out the typical condiments as they do in Thailand...and because it was so busy I didn't bother to ask as it would've taken awhile. There wasn't much chicken in the Noddles. I thought it was a bit bland as I travel often to Thailand every year...so not quite on point. But again it was ok.Ordered a coconut cake but was really small from what I had in mind. Pound cake was very moist but again it seemed a little bland. It was ok.Server was good...and nice

Had dinner here with friends. Food on the whole was good especially the Tom Kha Gai. Sticky mango rice was a let down. Rice wasn't warm and was dry like it was left over from previous day. Unfortunately the place a quite big and echoes as lot as there are no soft furnishings and there was a large table of very noisy women behind us which made it difficult for us to hear each other and have a decent conversation.
4
If you are looking to have authentic thai food in Singapore, this is the place you may want to go. From the appetizer to the main course to the dessert, they are as good as it tastes in Thailand. The place reminded me of a restaurant I visited in Sogo Bangkok that was opened by the Royal Chef who cooked for the royal family. However, do note that the price is quite steep as compared to other thai eatery you can find in Singapore

Went with few friends to Yhingthai on 13 Dec... The place is quite easy to find, within walking distance from City Hall or Bugis mrt stations. When we arrived at she restaurant, islet was nicely decorated with Xmas tree and decorations, it makes the ambience warm and cosy. The staff is attentive and provides good recommendations on popular dishes to order from this restaurant. Will definitely recommend this restaurant and will go again to try other dishes.

Really enjoyed going to this restuarant on a recommendation of a colleauge. We didn't have a reservation but they found a table for us. Some staff didn't speak great English but there was someone who did. Food was really tasty. It's also walking distance to Bugis St markets which is an added bonus

Yhingthai does itself proud by commanding a high standard of food.We had chicken larb, pomelo salad, tom yum soup, stuffed crispy rice crackers with dip, chicken wings, otak, grilled squid with paprika sauce, mixed vegetables with lotus root, pork green curry, olive rice. All the flavors were distinctive and delicious. If you donâ€™t like too much spice, you should consult before ordering, tom yum soup and larb whacked a strong punch.After a very satisfying meal, we washed it down with red ruby and mango and sticky rice. Hahaha
4
The food is good generally and the service is fine too. My German friends are happy with food and service. One suggestion: Please serve the food in a slow way even no many guests so that my friends can enjoy the food one by one.
3
Prices have gone up and portions are smaller than before. Asked to pay bill after 8.30pm as they claim they need table for next group of diners.
4
Tried the pad thai, the stuffed chicken, the mango sticky rice and the dry fish curry! Excellent food !
5
Visited as a couple. Ordered the Spicy Beef salad, and spring rolls as entree - both very good and the beef was not overly spicy. Had deep fried Grouper and spicy chicken for mains - grouper excellent, chicken good. Bottle of Italian Pinot Griggio with dinner - excellent. Total bill S$211. Very happy overall. Highly recommen
3
The food was nice, but service can be improved further. We requested specifically for the food to be just slightly spicy as we can't take too spicy food, but think they missed it out and was still really spicy. And the serving of food was really slow, waited more than half an hour for the food to be ready, and we had to ask them about it twice. Serving size is good for 2 pax for sharing.
5
Visited for our first meal in Singapore whilst staying at Naumi hotel around the corner.Absolutely delicious Thai food! We had the stuffed chicken wings which were juicy, deboned and lovely and crispy. The spring rolls with a sweet sauce. A spicy Thai red curry and pad Thai! The staff were very attentive and absolutely lovely! Felt very welcome and the restaurant has a lovely interior/atmosphere. Would recommend this Thai! Not too pricey.. would spend the same on a Thai meal in England!
4
I recently dined at Yhingthai Palace after a long gap (several years) .. ordered my favourite dishes and and the food is still as I remembered it... EXCELLENT! Must haves: Green mango salad, Seafood vermicelli salad, stuffed chicken wings for starters, fried fish fillet, Tom Yum soup with vegetarian / seafood/ prawn options., and their desserts. Durian dessert is not available this time ... not in season :(Will be back.. hopefully soon
3
Easy walk from the Raffles City area. This is a reasonably large restaurant with a fairly bland layout and seating. The food was far from bland with a great range of spicy salads on offer as starters. For main course we shared the minced chicken and basil, giant prawns in spicy sauce and fried fish. All tasted really fresh and portion sizes were good.Would certainly visit agai
4
Have been frequenting this Thai restaurant with my family over the past few years. The standard of food has never disappoint. Just a small point to note, the waitress can slow down her pace of retrieving finished plates... it seemed like she just can't wait to finish her task and trying to "force" customers to eat faster..
4
Perfect place for dinner before attending a performance at the drama centre across the road at the National Library. We love the tom yum, kangkong fried with soybeans, the succulent pandan chicken, Thai fishpaste and the prawn drizzled in lime juice. The price is on the high side but it is worth the money. Go give yourself a treat
5
we have been to yhinhthai couple of times and still likes to go back there since they serve quality thai food. the promfret was very nicely done and cant find it anywhere else.
3
Authentic Thai food. Portion served are not worth for that price! Noisy atmosphere! Staffs are not friendly.
3
Food was average. Not bad, but not outstanding, pricing is on the high side. Service was attentive and pleasant.
4
Restaurant deco and ambience feels more upmarket but the food quality matches it. Superb fried fish!

I've been going to this restaurant for years on a regular basis. The quality of food is good and authentic because they have Thai chefs in the kitchen. The prices have always been high, always pushing the boundary of whether the food is worth the cost (especially as there are good alternatives available at much lower cost). Last night I went to Yingthai and ordered a few small dishes - papaya salad, minced chicken salad, morning glory, kailan, chicken curry, 3 small plain rice and a fried rice. For drinks, 2 lemon grass tea, a coconut, and 2 cans of beer. Even though I expect the bill the be high I was surprised at $164 so I decided to check through the items. Ahh, I spotted it I thought - "Seafood with fried rice" and pointed it out to the waitress. She then proceeded to inform me that they don't do fried rice so had to order "Seafood fried rice minus the seafood, and there isn't a discount for items removed". Wow! That's like ordering a side of fries only be charged $50 for steak-and-fries ... minus the steak! I told the waitress that it was outrageous to charge $18 for a small plate plain fried rice. It was astonishing to see that they thought this was acceptable, to rip off a customer this was. Anyway, the waitress was starting to grasp by annoyance at this and so ushered the manager. Still with no success at explaining their policy and with the words of one of their best customers starting to sink in "I am never coming back here" they rectified that pricing - though they still opted to keep a 10% service charge! Lol - how badly to do you have to be cheated to get that bit taken off your bill at this restaurant? Anyways, the F&B business is a highly competitive customer business. Treating loyal customers this way is a disgrace. Honestly, for the prices they charge you can fly to Bangkok and enjoy a really awesome meal (and importantly, not feel cheated). I will not be going back to this restaurant. I will take my loyalty and recommendations to other establishments

We always live Thai food and it's always a pleasure of going back to Yhingtai. We all love the stuffed chicken wings, olive rice, red curry with prawns and the dessert is definitely the highlight. The mango with sticky rice and Thai ruby are equally great and my family really appreciates them and never want to miss.

Yhingthai Palace is somewhere I have brought many overseas guests to for many years. They serve consistently delicious food. On Monday, we had a group of old friends meet there for dinner. Service was brisk and friendly, food was as I have come to expect. I have to admit, the prices were a little higher than I remembered them to be. We were asked to check the bill before we settled it, but as conversation was flowing and the descriptions were in their Thai names (romanised) we didn't study it until a day later. We discovered that a dish we did not order (fried rice) had been charged to our bill. One of our group sent an email around 11pm and soon received a reply from Marcus the General Manager after midnight. He recalled our party, apologised for the incident and was quick to offer a method of refund. The following day, the refund was received. The immediacy of his actions was really impressive and I would like to commend the excellent service we received
5
Before being named as a Bib Gourmand by Michelin , this restaurant had always served consistent quality Thai food at reasonable prices. The award in 2016 was well deserved.Nothing has changed. The crowds are more now which puts pressure on the small number of service staff..I have visited the restaurant a few times and each time I enjoyed the dining experience
5
We booked dinner here as we were catching a musical nearby at the Drama centre. The food was delicious and through no fault of the kitchen's, we had to rush off before our second order of stuffed chicken wings were out. Marcus the manager called to liaise with us and we were able to collect it the next day. What delightful service! These touches really make a difference, thank you

Highly recommended Thai Restaurant with lovely and comfortable ambience to visit for authentic Thai food and desserts. A must not miss venue for relative reunion dinner gathering whenever we visit Singapore. Yummy Tom Yum soup with fresh seafood , yummy crispy fried pomfret with tasty sauce, fried chicken wings and Durian sticky rice dessert are among our favourites and many more.. !Their service is also good. Go for it!
4
The services was kind of slightly above average. But I am impressed by how they handle service recovery. Their sincerity touched my friends and myself. We definitely go back again .
5
this is where you get authentic thai food and the best by all definition. The service staff are very professional and the setting is excellent for business lunches.
2
Unfriendly and undifferent staff, way too spicy food (and no indications of this in the menu) and nothing really special about the food. Good juices and nice surrondings though.
4
good reliable Thai restaurant in the city. A little pricey but you can count on their consistent quality of food and ambience. Service could be more attentive.
4
Solid execution but nothing to write home about. I did enjoy the olive rice and pomelo salad. Chicken wings were overrated. Not a
Bad place if you're in the area.
5
Great food with delicate flavours. Still good after all these years. A family favourite.
We like the pomelo salad, mango salad, rice crackers with mince chicken, stuffed chicken wings, fish cake, green curry, deep fried pomfret, olive rice.
3
Lunch with my family. Food not too bad, drink totally overpriced, nearly $6 for a small glass half filled with ice for a Lemongrass drink , which tastes pretty ordinary- nothing special ! Even the ambiance is nothing fantastic.If you want to pay for a "kitchy " ambience, by all means 
5
We did not order much, as there were only 5 of us. However, the quality and taste of food is so satisfying. We had green curry (S), mixed vegetables (L), mango salad (S). Lemongrass chicken wings (S) were slightly salty. We first ordered crabmeat fried rice (M) and it was sooo yummy we ordered another Medium one! Tom Yum Soup was per serving, and quite spicy.It was not cheap but quality and taste match the price... The waitresses are very nice to help decide on the size (of the food), very quick to refill water, and very helpful to take us take group photos

Two years ago on 22 Feb 2015, I did a review of Yhingthai Palace Restaurant. Since then the establishment has been listed in the 2016 Michelin Guide for Singapore as the inspector’s favourite for good value under SG$45.00. So I was interested to see what has changed if at all. The restaurant is still at the same address. There are three rooms decorated with Thai artefacts, and waitresses dressed in traditional Thai dress. Lighting is good but the noise levels quite high from the absence of sound absorbing materials like curtains or carpets. We went as a party of five people and had a screaming child across the room which was very distracting in an unpleasant way. The service is very good as usual, warm and helpful, friendly and accommodating. The menu has not changed much.At the recommendation of the waitress, we ordered the Set menu for four adults costing $268.00 ++ , adding where needed, an extra portion for the 5th diner in the group. There were 8 (a lucky number for Chinese) dishes plus a desert and since it was the last night of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, we started with the Fa Cai Yu Sheng with salmon. Although this was a small plate portion, there was enough for each person to have a generous helping of Yu Sheng. They used rice crisps and pickled small white onions with roasted almonds.Next was the deep-fried, de-boned, chicken wings stuffed with asparagus, Shiitake mushrooms and chicken meat. This one of their signature dishes and our favourite. Glad to say it did not disappoint us. Crispy skin, piping hot filling, nicely flavoured even without the sweet chili sauce.The deep fried pomfret with mango sauce was next, again another of their popular dishes. Crispy on the outside, tender fleshy meat going well with a chili sauce and a sliced garlic red chili sauce on the side. We wanted something different from their usual mango sauce. Crab meat fried rice came and had a delicious aroma and generous helping of crab meat. The stir fried baby Kailan with dried Sole fish was also flavourful. The Tom Yum sea food was also very fragrant, with generous amounts of sliced of lemon grass. We liked that the soup was clear, spicy but not chili hot.The Thai green curry with chicken and winter melon was next. This has to be eaten with steamed white rice, but it’s also good on it’s own. They had tender slices of chicken meat and winter melon cubes which was a change. The Red Ruby served in shaved ice, with water chestnut, Jack fruit, Palm fruit and coconut milk made a refreshing end to the meal. The crunchy bits of the water chestnuts and the Jack fruit strips were delicious.Although the set menu was for four adults, the five of us ate till we were thoroughly stuffed! Not cheap, but this is to be expected here in a fine dining Thai restaurant. I would have liked changes of soiled plates, more so considering that the restaurant was not packed full at the time we were there. WiFi not available. Wheel chair friendly, toilets available in the restaurant premises

My previous experience was much better Though the pricing was on the high side,the value was a bit disappointing .Average cheque per pax is nearly $60 on similar food ordered before.I think they should increase the quantity of food served to justify the costing.I will not visit this outlet again until they reviewed their operation..Thank you
5
Good selection of food that is labelled Gluten Free. Authentic Thai food. Will be even better if more dishes are gluten free!
3
The pomelo salad was refreshing. Staff was professional and efficient. Overall, the place lacks warmth and felt soulless even though decor was nice and food was good. Nothing memorable about the experience. I wouldn't actively recommend this place.
4
Well fitted out but casual and chilled out atmosphere nonetheless. Dishes come in multiple sizes but small portions of each were enough to share. Excellent flavour combinations in all dishes sampled: salad, soup and curry.
5
The quality of food here is excellent , we ordered set menu for ten people and everybody was so happy with the food.
Each item we ordered was superb.
Service wise from them waitresses could be improved though
4
Authentic Thai food.
Chicken drumstick stuffed with mushroom and fish cake are excellent!
Staffs are rather short handed, but they do their best.
5
Good food with warm service, and the thing I have to highlight is the smoothly and effective reservation processing.
5
My sister who lives in Singapore had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while. We went a lunch time - it wasn't too busy which was nice. We started off with the Yam Som Oh (fresh pomelo salad with shredded chicken and prawns tossed in a spicy dressing) and Miang Kum (ginger, chili, dried shrimps, peanuts and a sauce wrapped in a betelnut leaf) followed by Gaeng Keow Wan Kai (thai green chicken curry), Phad Kra Pao Mhoo (minced pork stir fry with herbs and chopped chilli), Tom Kha Kai (coconut chicken soup), Kung Sam Rot (deep fried big prawns with 3 flavour chilli sauce - min 2 order), all finished off with a mango and rice pudding dessert. Everything tasted amazing - the whole meal was very enjoyable and was very reasonably priced. I would definitely go back next time i'm in Singapore! ;-
5
This is my family's favourite Thai restaurant, we've been coming here for years. The food is always good and authentic! And now Chope makes it easier to make reservations there! :)The only thing I would suggest to facilitate reservations via Chope is to allow for larger group reservations (more than 6) and reservations on weekend nights
4
Food was excellent and very delish, service was impeccable/thoughtful and the prices were decent. We ordered the stuffed chicken wings, Pomelo Salad and Claypot Prawns with Crystal noodles, followed by dessert Mango Sticky rice and Coconut Chiffon. Absolutely delish. I was also pleasantly surprised that the cake came with candles as it was my BFF's birthday and I had only mentioned this casually during the time of reservation and was not expecting them to remember.

In London we’ve looked in vain for ‘real’ Thai food, and sadly we have come to the conclusion that it probably doesn’t exist (please let me know otherwise). All the restaurants we have been to, presumably afraid of frightening the locals with the spiciness that is central to Thai cuisine, as well as having an eye to cost, dish up a pathetically feeble version, with ghastly and teeth-grinding sweetness, watery insubstantial sauces, an appallingly limited range of dishes and, as with the worst forms of Chinese cuisine, bulked up with cheap peppers and onions that are wholly destructive to any residual subtelty. This approach should be considered a crime against culinary art. It would be a fine legacy for the widely loved King Bhumipol, who died when we were in South East Asia, if at least some of these pallid menus could return to the great traditions of Thai cuisine. In Singapore for a couple of days, I begged Laura’s niece, a resident for many years, to treat us to as near-real Thai food as she could manage. Sadly we were able to go to this fine restaurant only once: but I will be back (Laura finds it a little over-spiced, so I may have to make the journey myself). Within a stone’s throw of Raffles Hotel, so in a swish part of town, it is quite pricey (around £40 a person – not helped by a plunging exchange rate – and that included almost no alcohol). But it was worth every cent by reorientating us to the pungent, full-on but wonderful flavours of Thai food. Service is elegant, fast and unobtrusive; décor all the above, apart from fast. We tucked into a wide variety of small starter dishes and main courses. Notable novelties for us included: • Pomelo salad (yam som oh): mild oriental grapefruit, with roasted coconut, brown rice and a tangy Thai dressing• Thai red dry beef curry (pa nang m-nur): thinly sliced beef in a red curry sauce drizzled with thick coconut milk – especially fine, I thought• Stir fried beans (khing thaw yao) in a spicy Thai paste• Olive rice (khao phad nam li): a colourful salad that you mix yourself, including white rice with chopped olives, chicken pieces, little shrimp, sliced shallots, cucumber slices and pomelo.But I can’t see anyone going wrong by using a random number programme to generate your manu.Laura finished in dessert heaven: her first taste this year of durian, the food most likely to start a civil war somewhere in South East Asia. I don’t find it repulsive, as do many westerners, but I can’t work up the frenetic enthusiasm that it elicits in most Malaysians. Here the durian (we confirmed that it was Malaysian, widely considered the very finest) was classically served with coconut milk and steamed glutinous rice flavoured with pandan leaves. Both Laura and her niece highly approved: trust me – recommendations don’t come higher. More to my taste, Thai ruby is a delight to the eye and to the palate (coconut milk, tapioca coated water chestnuts, jackfruit pieces and palm seed pulp). Finally sour mango with glutinous rice and coconut milk. Singapore cuisine overall is good, though note that many Singaporeans will not hesitate to cross the causeway to Malaysia where the food is breathtakingly wonderful. But you couldn’t do better than stay in Singapore and treat yourself at least once at this fine restaurant

Wonderful interesting dishes set in a colonial shophouse on Purvis street. Excellent service and good for bringing groups of ppl.
3
Came here for lunch today with some colleagues and ordered a selection of dishes. Food was decent but not exceptional. Service was fine. No issues getting a seat without a reservation.
1
Steamed sea bass fish with garlic/chili/lime was not fully cooked where the main fish body meat are in raw condition attach to the bone and pendan chicken over fry until very dry.
4
If you want authentic Thai food, this has to be the choice! The tom yum soup, boneless chicken, fried promfret fish are some of the dishes that you should not go without. And of course, the red ruby dessert!! Yummy!
4
Really liked the appetizers - Bethel leaves in particular were delicious - the whole meal was good / nit outstanding but authentic , well prepared and good . I usually take Western relatives there from out of town, because I think the service us excellent , and the food is simple and good. This said, I have failed to find a truly outstanding Thai place in Singapore so will settle for this one. Warning : the wine list us terrible and their red Italian tastes likes gasoline - really really really friendly service which compensates for the gasoline 
3
We stopped by after walking around the neighborhood out of curiosity because of hubster's craving for Thai food. There was another contender around the same neighborhood but we opted for this. We ordered the fish, pad thai & durian with glutinous rice. Food was so-so, service alright but pretty pricey in comparison to others. We liked the atmosphere though. We MIGHT come back next time to try on other items.
4
We went to the Yhingthai Palace on the recommendation of one of the hotel team and we weren't disappointed. The selection of Thai dishes was nicely varied and the service was prompt. I always look out for restaurants that are frequented by local people and the Yhingthai Palace certainly seems to meet that criteria. A good spot, easy walking distance from the hotel with good food; not too pricey either
5
This is our 2nd visit to Yhing Thai Palace. This is the finest Thai cuisine we have eaten thus far.Food that we have tried and loved it:1) crab fried rice - not oily and lots of crab meat. Very well done fried rice. Must try!2) stuff chicken wing - tasty and fried to perfection.3) Tom Yum Soup - you can choose the clear or red. We had the clear soup and non spicy. The soup was very fragrant.4) Kang Kong vegetable - very nicely prepared, a must try!5) Rice Cracker - dip the rice cracker into the chicken and shrimp dipping sauce, it's a marriage in heaven.Do book in advance to avoid disappointment as this restaurant is usually full. Will return again soon.
4
I hadn't been here for about six years but was reminded of it when scouring Tripadvisor for a good Thai restaurant to try.It was a Saturday night and very busy, but we managed to get a table at short notice nevertheless. The restaurant has a plush comfortable feel to it and makes one feel one is enjoying a special occasion.All the dishes we chose were excellent, including a strip loin beef salad, really simple but outstanding, red duck curry, and stuffed chicken wings. The only slight downside to the evening was our waitress who, whilst perfectly efficient, could not bring herself to smile once at either us or any of the other guests she served
4
A perfectly enjoyable dinner out with friends at Yhingthai last night. The restaurant has been at this spot for more than 15 years and in Singapore, this makes it close to a local institution.We ordered lots - mango salad, rice crackers with minced chicken in a coconut sauce, vermicelli with prawns, green curry, deep fried pomfret with mango sauce, long beans with sambal and a crabmeat omelette.Every dish was delicious; in particular we would recommend the mango salad (nicely balanced as it wasn't too sour tasting), vermicelli and prawns (very tasty) and the fluffy omelette with real crab meat.The only slight disappointment was the pomfret dish which was on the small side for S$40. Service was attentive and efficient. We were greeted immediately on arrival, the food was served promptly and our complementary tap water was constantly topped up. The dining room caters for both large and small groups. Are there cheaper Thai food offerings around - yes though we'd have to point out that the difference would be akin to eating Chinese food at a restaurant and a coffee shop. Both may serve delicious food - apart from price, the variables are the quality of ingredients, consistency in the execution and presentation of the dishes, standard of service and comfort of the dining environment.All of us at dinner have been eating here for some time and agreed that Yhingthai does well on all these points. Is it as good as what you would get in Bangkok? No but it does it does come close.
4
Expensive but good. The chefs are from Thai. The tomyam can be really spicy. So ask for medium. The owner is very rich. Small portions are good.
4
Pomelo salad with toasted coconut was real nice. Food is really good. Nice service.
Kids loved the rice crackers too.
Book in advance or be prepared to wait.
4
Loved the stuffed chicken wings and Tom yam soup. We ordered the mixed fried vegetables and roast duck red curry where were ok. Portions on the small side for the price. Service was ok.
3
It was my second time to this restaurant. Food was good especially I love their YuSheng. They have almond nuts inside too. Something different from the traditional Yu Sheng during Chinese New Year. Their chilled mango purÃ©e is unique too. They mix with unripe and ripe mango cubes, sago, aloe Vera too. Was very refreshing
4
I went with two long time customers to Yhingthai for lunch. I remembered it from years ago but could not remember the name. We had set lunch menu over Chinese new year which made it more pricey. Tom Yum soup had just the right amount of spice. Grilled fish and tapioca were great. Nice service and atmosphere. Seems to stay busy so may want to book ahead. Not the cheapest Thai meal in town, but very enjoyable.
3
The signature fried pomfret is replaced by sea bass - did not disappoint but would have been better if pomfret supply was more regular. The chicken wings are a must but you can give the green curry a miss. The presentation for the glutinous rice can be improved ! Not cheap but given this establishment is still around after 20+ plus years, you can infer it must be good otherwise they would have been shut down. There are other far better Thai restaurants around but they will cost you more. Also 2 cheap ones up the streets if you don t need the ambience and have likely an equally good version of green curry
2
Every Thai place in Singapore tends to have slightly different interpretations of the same dishes. Subjectively, and authenticity aside, some places you may find more appealing than others. But on the whole, I found the cooking technique here to be quite average and not at all worth the price premium. Tried a wide range of dishes - minced chicken larb kai, green curry (watery), pad thai, pineapple rice (nothing special, to put it mildly - I could match that kind of standard as an average home cook), couple of vegetable dishes. Worth noting that most of the dishes were a tad oversalted. Only stand-out was the lemongrass fried chicken wings. Well-fried and very tasty.Bottom line: considering the ample dining options along this street and its vicinity, I really would advise against using up your cash and stomach space here
5
We dined here with a colleague of my husband who has lived on the Island for many years and loves this restaurant. The salad starters were delicious, and in my case, adapted for a non-meat eater.The three of us had different versions of green curry; all very happy with our choices. The flavours were hot, vibrant fragrant and fresh. A truly enjoyable dinne
4
my friends picked this place for dinner, and when they told me they were only there 6 days ago, i knew it had to be good and it certainly did not disappoint. as frequent patrons, i left it to my friends to the ordering. at first, i thought they mustve ordered, but the portions are on the small-mid size so it actually turned out to be the perfect number of dishes for sharing. my favorite dishes were the Thai Crystal Noodles Salad with Shrimp and Squid, Deep Fried Grouper with Three Flavour Sauce and the Thai Red Ruby! if i'm ever back in singapore again in the near future, i would definitely make sure to have a meal here
3
I was let down by the food served when I hosted lunch on Monday.One of my all time favorites, fried olive rice, was very salty. The phad thai was very sweet. As the soup orders were for per person, I took the opportunity to order 4 types for my oversea Chinese guests to have a sampling - fish maw; clear tom yam gung, clear tom yam seafood; and one tom yam with coconut milk. I'm partial to clear tom yam soups but have to say the other two were nothing to write about.The deep fried fish with thai chilli sauce, stir fried mixed vegetables and mango salad were alright.Overall I felt, it was not value for the rather hefty bill at the end oft the meal
4
thai restaurant on Purvis Street. It might be wise to make a reservation. I ate here with a new friend. We had great thai food and the service was extremely good. It became very busy while we were there.
5
Food is always excellent. Family is always happy to dine at this restaurant. We had a fabulous dinner. Owner is always friendly and the staff is service is excellent. Glad to know his young son is helping out in the business.
5
brilliant place and brilliant service
the menu is well balanced and the choice is great
the waiter was professional and they are happy to customize your meal
back soon
4
This restaurant has been around for years, serving consistently authentic Thai food. Prices may be higher than others but the place is clean and service is good. Perfect for a causal meal, gatherings or entertaining. It can be crowded at times so reserve early and ask for a separate area if you want more privacy
5
I have been to Yhingthai several times during my trips to Singapore and I always love coming back to it. The food always is of the same great quality - full of flavour, beautifully presented and colourful. I think I have been there four or five times now and I don't think I will ever grow bored of dishes you can get in this place. The gold standards of tom yam, tom kha and curries are unbeatable and while this maybe isn't the cheapest of places you will have a great time at Yhingthai
4
As far as I can recall ,this place has been for ages and underwent interior renovation. The food is good each time I am here.So far all the dishes I chose did not disappoint. Try the Tom Yum clear soup, Souffle ( thai otah in banana leaf), stuffed chicken wings, olive rice. Authentic enough. This place is very versatile too- For business meals, social gathering, small group seating etc. Price is reasonable to
5
It's my best Thai restaurant in the city. Located in purvis street, near to bugis and city hall mrt. They serve authentic Thai cuisines. My favorite dishes: deep fried fish, stuff chicken wing, prawn and fish cake, Tom yum prawn soup, stir fried mince chicken with basil leaves and chopped chillies, mix vegetable and very good desert the durian glutinous rice. Nicely decorated restaurant and cosy ambience
4
We came here midweek for dinner therefore wasn't too busy and we were seated straight away. The wait staff were nice and attentive and the menu looked good. We chose green chicken curry, red pork curry and seafood fried rice. The curries had just the right amount of spice in them and the flavour was lovely.Thai desserts are not really our thing but our waiter did suggest we go for the shaved ice with coconut milk which also had ruby coloured water chestnuts in it which was a nice pop of sweetness. Our bill for dinner (which included 1 glass of red wine & a sparkling water) came to $87.90 inclusive of tax for two people. We thought this was quite good and enjoyed our meal here

The last time that we dined at the Yhingthai Palace Restaurant was probably six to eight years ago, and having recently had some visitors in town, decided to revisit this eatery for dinner. When I made a reservation that afternoon I was informed that there were 20 people ahead of us, and that we may probably be able to get a table in for six for dinner at 8.15 pm. A gentleman from the restaurant later called to confirm that a table was indeed available. This attention to phone reservations created a good impression.Yhingthai Palace was first opened in 1993 at 13 Purvis Street off Beach Road, with a seating capacity of about 60 pax. They served and are still serving authentic Thai food. After attempts at opening two other branches they, finally consolidated their business in 2010, at their present location which is at 36 Purvis Street #01-04 with a seating capacity of about 120 people. The ambiance is not much to shout about but the service is most friendly, attentive and polite. Dishes came out rather quickly, and served while warm.The place is wheel chair friendly, and has a toilet on site. It can be noisy at times when it’s crowded, but generally is pleasant. The lighting adequate, and there are set menus for varying group sizes.The restaurant is almost always packed for dinner and reservations are recommended. On this occasion we ordered:Yam Som Oh: Pomelo Salad. This was very tasty and so refreshing. Not too sweet or sour.Pla Dad Deow: Deep fried Sea Bass. One of their classic dishes. In the past we usually had deep fried pomfret, but as it is the festive season of the Chinese New Year, the fish is prohibitively expensive and was not offered in the menu.Peek Kai Sord Sai: Deboned Stuffed Chicken Wings. This is another classic dish of the restaurant and never fails to satisfy. Eaten with a sweet sauce. Highly recommended.Khao Phad Nam Liap: Thai Olive Rice Served with Condiments. As a variation to having pineapple rice in most places, we have in the past usually ordered the olive rice at this restaurant. This time the dish was just as good as it was years ago. Served up with sweet meats, crispy fried shrimps, lemon bits and chill padi.Gaeng Keow Wan: Thai Green Curry with a Choice of Chicken meat. In my opinion, one of the better green curries with chicken around! A little bit spicy and hot for some, but I liked it.Phad Prik Khing Thwa Yao: Thai String Beans Fried with Prawns and Chilli Paste. Another classic, and delicious with the crunchy prawns and slightly spicy flavours.Hor Mok Talay: Spicy Mixed Seafood Mousse. Each individual portion could be eaten in a mouth-full. But the flavours are indeed beautiful, the texture soft, and the fragrance emitted is heavenly.Tup Tim Krob: Thai Red Ruby. This Thai desert is made even more tasty with the addition of fresh coconut flesh and strips of jackfruit.Khao Neow Ma Muang: Mango Served with Glutinous Rice. The rice was silky smooth, chewy, and goes well with the cooling effects of the fragrant mango. Just heavenly!It’s good to see that Yingthai Palace has maintained their standard of food quality, although prices have gone upwards. But the service and friendly atmosphere compensates for this.The average cost per head for dinner with the above dishes, unlimited pour of Jasmine tea and three small bowls of steamed rice was $42/- inclusive of service charge and GST. A pleasant place to have a family meal or for entertaining guests and friends.Yhingthai Palace Restaurant Pte Ltd36 Purvis Street Singapore 188613Operating Hours: 11:30 am – 2:00 pm, 6:00–10:00 pmTel: 6337 1161 or 6337 9429.

Organised company dinner there for a group of 40. Pretty good food but don't expect authentic Thai food. It is a fine dining restaurant, with good presentation over taste. If you have business associates/visitors in town who do not mind not authentic Thai food, it is actually a good place to entertain. Walking distance from many hotels such as Raffles, Carlton, etc

We went there for lunch just because we stayed nearby. Nice restaurant. We tried chicken ring, crab fried rice. Generally, good but pricy. We ordered fried rice, 2 soup, 2 drink, salad, chicken ring and mango sticky rice as dessert. 100 SGD.
4
Try the stuffed chicken wings and the deep fried grouper. Skip the lemongrass drink, found it sickly sweet. Helpful staff. Overall good food
3
Their Price are on the high side as the restaurant is designed to be fine dining style but quality of the food is average and taste is not fantastic too, walk down the lane to a thai coffeeshop, First Thai, they are much much better.

My partner and I visited this restaurant on a friday evening and we hadn't booked so we had to wait for a table. It wasn't a long wait and the food was worth the wait. The restaurant was quite busy but the food didn't take long to arrive - we had prawns, thai green curry, pineapple rice and a vegetable dish which was all lovely
3
First throughout the meal it was difficult to get attention but the service that came with the dessert really left a bad taste. The mango sticky rice dessert arrived and there was no coconut cream hence we asked a waitress. Face blackened, she pointed at the dessert (1 cm away,her nail almost touching the dessert)and we saw at the bottom of the sesame seeds a smear of cream. We asked for more and grudgingly she returned and plonked it on the table! Yhing Thai has great good but it is a pity the service has deteriorated to this
3
The restaurant has a huge selection of thai food and we ordered the chicken wings as people have commented its a must try. Honestly for a deep fried dish I thought it wasnt worth the calories. The portion of the mango salad at SGD 15 was very small and i also found it very salty. Ordered the steamed fish with garlic and lemon juice which was very nice. Fresh and authentic. The veg green curry was nice but nothing you would write home about. Parking can be a challenge as its only street parking thats available.Overall nice ambiance but other than that very average fare. Not going back there again

We went here for dinner with colleagues and enjoyed it, started with Tom Yam soup which was perfectly delicious followed rice cake,mango salad, stuffed chicken wings, green and red curry.All were so yummy and very balanced, lastly enjoyed tapioca, red ruby & durian with glutinous rice.Food was no doubt very good but slightly on higher side
5
My wife and I ate here on our wedding anniversary. The food was excellent as was the service. they even provided us with a nice anniversary desert, which was nice touch. The restaurant is full of locals rather than tourists, which as a tourist was nice! Also this means it is better value
4
We had dinner here one night when staying at the nearby Fairmont Hotel. The food was deliciously spicy and the service good. Unlike other Singapore restaurants which struggled with the concept of starter and main course (bringing everything at once), our choices were served separately here. Reasonably good prices for Singapore too

Nice and quiet place, ideal for a business lunch. It's really not at all crowded during lunch hour, primarily because of its location, I would think.There are tables for small groups and big groups, so the setting is really fantastic for whatever kind of meal you're looking to have - business, casual or with friends. Unfortunately service was only just okay. The servers, though reasonably responsive, seemed lethargic and slow, and they all had pretty much no expressions on their faces at all times. Jeez, smile much?The food is very good though. My group ordered the likes of some green chicken curry, drumlets, stir-fried kangkong, fish cakes and fried pineapple rice. And all of it were very good and tantalized our tastebuds. My boss was very pleased at the end of lunch.Recommended if you're looking for some fancy restaurant for good Thai food and don't mind paying abit of premium

I love Thai food and really enjoy the food offered by Yhing Thai. Short of me going all the way to Bangkok to feed my Thai food cravings. It is at a slightly pricey side, but you will definitely enjoy the whole dining experience.

I have been to the Yhingthai Palace on a number of occasions so thought it was time I wrote a review. My favorites here are the green mango salad, the fried pomfret and the fried marinated chicken. Curries are great too.
Highly rcommended!

Great food, good service, not cheap. Seven of us were greeting an old friend back in town for a visit! Once we were all there, the food was good, the service was good. All the Thai favorites were delicious. We had green curry, pad thai, pomelo salad, beef in lettuce wrap, tom yum ( "hotness" to order), fish cake, chicken wings, olive rice, pineapple rice, fish maw soup, durian and red ruby desserts.Every dish was good enough to "take away the leftovers"!My guests had trooped to another place due to poor street address numbering. This restaurant is closer to North Bridge Road but is always confused with another Thai cafe at other end of the street. I've never eaten at the other place.I had to change reservation details( date and no. of pax) several times and the staff who answered the phone were unfailingly polite and pleasant! That already gives a good impression

If you want a dumbed down and dull version of Thai food this is the place.The food is bland, probably the blandest I have ever had in a Thai restaurant. The menu is limited, they push set menus and the food on them, ordered by my friends, lacked the real excitement and taste of Thai food. Thai cuisine is wide ranging and it is not all about heat, but each dish has a balance and flavour that complements the other dishes and here it is sadly lacking.Service was ok, but they were unable to deliver one of the set menu dishes as they had run out (top tip - don't run out of set menu dishes).Only place where Thai food has been as disappointing was in central London.If you are in London and want Thai by the way - go to Addies Thai in Earls Court - it is packed with Thai people!

I hunt for any Thai restaurant anywhere I travel (I live in Florida). Since 2004, I have dined Thai in at least 20 different countries including several in Singapore itself. I can say that Yingthai Palace is THE best Thai food I can taste and eat. Almost anything you order is extremely fresh and authentic. The ambiance of the restaurant could be improved, but personally, all I care for is the taste. Must try: Deep Fried Promfret, Deboned Chicken Wing stuffed with Mushrooms and "Asparagus, olive rice and Durian with Glutinous Rice". Of course, also, the Coconut Milk dessert. I plan to be in Singapore this month and will make sure to take pictures and post them for some of these dishes

Had lunch at Yhingthai with the family recently. It's been some time since I ate at Yhingthai, which I remember to be an excellent Thai restaurant.Some of the dishes - the boneless chicken wings is one of them - were still as good as I remember them to be, but others - such as the pomfret - seemed to be less tasty.The staff were not quite able to help with recommendations, and could have been a little more attentive. Perhaps it was because we stayed beyond their last order time.Overall, I'd say it is still a decent - albeit slightly pricey - Thai restaurant

My Favorite Thai food are yam woonsen and mango salad. Both foods were so good. Pad Thai was extra ordinary sweet and not enough tamarind. Fish cake was good. The steam fish was mild as expected. The prawn with vermicelli was tasteless. The service was fast and perfect. The prices are quite high for the area. We ate lunch on March 19, 2013
4
I will caveat this with the fact that I am from Houston, Texas, but we have a large Asian community and some great Thai restaurants in Houston. This is my second visit to Yhingthai while in Singapore for business, and the green mango salad is delicious, and I have had the green chicken curry both times. The fresh tapioca with coconut cream is a delicious dessert! I find the service fine, and the wait staff friendly enough. I would definitely come back

I came here April 16 2012. Singapore has many great food options and for me this is one of them. It is not cheap neither is it expensive. The food is delicious. We had pomelo salad, the chicken wings, a red curry and steamed groper. The mango sticky rice for dessert was as good as i have had in Thailand. really! :)  All food was fresh, good and spicy with lots of different flavours. It is a popular place and well worth a try
5
This restaurant has very good thai soup (tom yum soup, their fish maw soup is rather tasty too). I like their stuffed chicken wings (very soft and the meat is rather tender), their wrapped chicken. I also love their crackers, and also their dessert- mango with sticky rice.  The only downside is that their waiters and waitresses seem to understand Thai only
3
Pleasant enough setting for a large group and the food was reasonable, as was the price. Unfortunately the staff lacked the professionalism to make an average place a good place. Friendly, but uncertain and weren't able to assist with ordering.

Very good Thai food

One of the better thai restaurants in SG.

Their dessert - Mango glutinious rice! Yum!

I was eager to try the Pla Ng Manau (steamed fish with lemon sauce) ever since I ate it in Ubod Ratchathani. I had it here at a shop in Circular Road which was almost as good. Here at Yingthai, The fish was steamed well but the lemon sauce had a bitter after taste and too sour, it need a little bit of sweetness which this dish didnt have. We also had vegetables, mango salad and chicken. There was something we ate that was good but i need to look at my receipt to see what it was! Cant remember the name. Next time i will make sure i write the reviews soon after I visit. The overall feeling is that the service and food didnt blow me away, otherwise I would have remembered it distinctly (like the Peppers review). Maybe I need to go again. It did look crowded and busy though

Was recommended the large fish (800gms -SGD50.00) for our group of 6 people. On arrival the fish was no more than 400gms. Spoke to owner who reduced the price but no apology whatsoever. Lesson- BEWARE WHEN ORDERING FISH IN SINGAPORE RESTAURANTS. Always check for weight and if possible sight it. There are good restaurants around but this one ...........................oops!
1
The wait staff here seem to have an attitude problem! They won't even look you in the eye and half-listen to your requests. When we asked not to have the coconut kernel in our pomelo salad, the dish came with the kernel but they left something else out!!! Food wise it is just okay.. definitely not the best! I can get much better Thai food down the street at Shaw Tower on Beach Road for a fraction of the price
