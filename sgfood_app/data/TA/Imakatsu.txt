We had miso pork, which was delicious! I had a regular pork katsu, it's a little dry as there is no sauce but the meat is tender and juicy with a crunchy outside.

I usually have the miso soup, edamame and the cabbage salad (free top-ups) with sesame dressing. Absolutely delicious and an ideal light option for dinner. My friends swear by the katsu and chicken breasts. The prices are relatively affordable.

I had lunch in their newly opened branch located at the new Tanjong Pagar Center, next to many other restos. I recommend the hire katsu set meal. It comes with a fairly good sized breaded pork cutlet. Meat cut is leaner, less fat so it is healthier, but more expensive than the regular rosu katsu.The meal also includes miso soup, shredded cabbage and other condiments like mustard and sweet katsu sauce with sesame seeds.I've had better cuts of meat, but this is not bad

Went for dinner , restaurant still under staff, only two staffs around, restaurant almost full, it's the same situations from our first visit. Waiting to be seated takes quite a while.After taken our orders, the staff went off , very busy. We were not serve our food, while another table next to ours were quickly served. Question the service staffs, no reply. Foods is reasonable and on the high side, but service up to today very unsatisfactory. Will not return

Their mentai pork katsu is to-die-for! The pork is soft and juicy on the inside, and perfectly crunchy on the outside. The mentaiko sauce also adds a nice flavor as well. Their rice is also nice and soft.I love Imakatsu so much and actually go there every week

My Personal Recommendation for this restaurant is the Premium Mentaiko Pork Loin Katsu and also the Fried Oyster Katsu.The Mentaiko Pork Loin have a complex taste and open up when you just have a light bite on the pork Loin. Its is just slightly more chewy than the Kurobuta Pork Katsu but worth the price for this 180g Pork katsu Loin (for the ladies can go for the smaller 120g one. The Mentaiko goes very well with the Rice and best with Chill Beer served with it.As for the Fried Oyster it is Juicy and fresh and recommend to add a small plate of the mentaiko to go with it

Had a meal and few drinks there with a Friend. It is a first time visit so I was expecting something better for the price. Had the chicken Katsu set and beer. Decent food but not very memorable Pefer something like saboten at the millennium walk or tonkatsu resturants

Lunch to celebrate friend's birthday was at the newly opened outlet instead of Star Vista. Centrally located & linked to the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station, this Tonkatsu Japanese restaurant was a busy outlet. We had to wait for a table even though it was past 1pm. The ambience was ok and the service staff were friendly. There was a free flow of cabbage salad. The alacarte meal was good too and we didn't have to wait long for them. Worth a try if you are in the area

Conveniently located at Star Vista which is linked by a covered walkway to Buona Vista MRT station, this restaurant serves one of the best Tonkatsu!Our party of 6 each ordered either the Premium pork loin cutlet zen or Pork loin cutlet with garlic zen. The orders came with Miso soup, Pickled vegetables, White sticky steamed rice and Raw cut cabbage (the latter two items : unlimited servings). For beverages we had a bottle of Sake, cold & hot green tea.Being a Tonkatsu specialty restaurant with chefs from Japan in the kitchen, it was no surprise that the pork loin cutlets were succulent, juicy, sweet and tender; with the golden-yellow bread crumbs done just right without any oily taste or texture! The spicy mustard complemented the Tonkatsu perfectly. The cabbage was so freshly delicious mixed with the peanut- based sauce that we had 3 large helpings among us!My first visit there...but certainly not my last

Went on a Sunday with my daughter around 11.45am. Order the fried pork loin set about 120g with free flow of rice and cabbage. The meal went perfectly well and the food was tasty. Even my 3 year old daughter eats it. However I would like to point out that the waitress taking the order had very little clue about the food of the restaurant. Ask what kind of tomatos were being serve, she responded that she thinks it's is the normal kind, ask her what is the difference between the pork and the premium pork loin, she looks at the menu for a while trying to work out the difference on her own. When I said is it the same but just difference in size 120g versus 180g? She said yes. And when I ask so the premium pork loin is of the same quality as pork loin but just of a different cut size? She replied again " I thinks the premium pork loin is a better quality one." I gave up trying to get more information but just order a normal pork loin. No second helping of rice or cabbage was offered though we finished everything. I didn't asked. A guy was helpful to provide me with a toddler chair when I arrive. They do need to retrain their staff though. It's my second visit here, servers are clueless both times and mostly look bored to be there. No smiles.When I ask question, I feel like they are guessing my answers

Tasty Tonkatsu. crispy. Good range of dishes - pork (including premium pork), chicken, seafood, vegetables. Cabbage salad -finely shredded and dressing not watery.
Good premium sake (300ml) - price abt S$40.00. Free re-fills for brown tea.
Service is acceptable.

If you are a katsu fan, you may like this restaurant as it offers a variety of katsu. Those who are not katsu fans will have a limited menu to choose from. The restaurant is a bit expensive and fails to invoke excitement about how wonderful Japanese food is. I went with a group of Japanese friends who mostly commented that it was...okay

We used to come here regularly and always liked the food. Unfortunately, the service has worsened and we definitely won't be back. There used to be a Japanese manager making sure the service is as you would expect in a Japanese restaurant, but that didn't appear to be the case anymore. A few examples of our experience:- when we entered there was a queue. We were asked how many people and were then told in a rather strong tone YOU MUST WAIT. That was kind of obvious because of the queue but it was the tone that really turned us off. - another customer was waiting for a table for two, yet when a new couple came the lady seemed to have forgotten that there was someone else and she offered the table to the new couple (the others then complained, and didn't even get an apology for the mistake)- our rice portion was so small, it was almost an insult. It seemed as if the restaurant wanted to save some money by reducing the portions.- the waitress wanted to take our plates away while we were still eating (this is actually not unusual in Singapore)- there wasn't even a "thank you" or "please come again" after we paid the bill.Poor service like this is not acceptable to us. There are better places than this

I don't understand how this place got a Michelin recommendation. The food is mediocre and service so-so. I went there last week as other eateries were very crowded during lunch hour. And I happened to received a flyer for a free drink. The restaurant was quite empty at the end I entered. I had passed by the restaurant on several occasions but never had the urge to enter. I love fried food. I'm a tonkatsu lover. I had high hopes for this Michelin recommended place. But alas I was disappointed. The service was quite curt. I'm not sure why the waitress kept chasing me to order. I barely sat down 1 min, she came again & again to ask if I will order now. Also At the entrance, I asked about the set lunch. She told me, come in, we have everything. Later when I wanted to order, she told me, set lunch is only Mon-Thurs. it was Friday... Sheesh. I ordered the mixed set - with mince pork, fillet pork, veg, prawn & chicken fillet. It was urgh not good. The mince meat fry was juicy but So Porky. The fillet pork was tough and porky. The prawn ok, the chicken fillet ok but the so-called veg?? It was a tiny round slice of Japanese sweet potato. I don't know how that constitutes as veg. Rice & shredded cabbage are free flow. I guess they expect people to ask for refills so the first portion of rice they gave was so meager. Just one small scoop. I had to ask for a refill - another small scoop. Sigh. Too much work for me just for a meal. Didn't like the miso soup lid, it was too slippery and hard to remove. A first for me. Never had such trouble in other Japanese restaurants. The free yuzu sake taster was yummy though. That was the best part of the meal. The whole meal, cost me $28 inclusive of tax. Very expensive for some fried foods. Will I be back? No. Is it worth it? No. The table next to me had to gentlemen who were gushing about how tasty the food was. I wonder if they've ever had any real tonkatsu. I'll be going to my usual favorite tonkatsu place. But definitely not here!

Simplicity done well. Tonkatsu cooked with love. I tried the pork and chicken fillet set. I would have preferred a better cut of meat (less dry more juicy) but it's my first time here so I chose too cautiously. The hero of the meal were my veggies. I love the DIY cabbage salad. Cabbage fresh, cold and crisp served with a yum-licious seasame dressing. And hello crispy cherry tomato and asparagus, you were so delicious and delicate. The set was simple and satisfying. Nothing makes me smile more than a meal prepared with heart. The 'oozy scotch egg' in the menu caught my eye but I was too full to have a add-on. I will be back.

Went a few time food standard is still good, serving reasonable, free flow rice and salad. Only drawback is Long wait to be seated, especially during meal hour dinner, very unnecessary, same problem, restaurant not full but seen half a fill with uncleared tables. Same problem each visit, thus service affected badly

I was there for dinner. Service was poor and the restaurant is seriously understaffed. Could not find any staff to request for anything. And if I do not ask for any help, the refilling of brown tea will probably take eons to happen. Guests from another table even had to stand up and get the pot of brown tea to refill on their own because either none of the staff wants to be attentive enough, or like I said, seriously understaffed, and therefore the restaurants cannot cater to the needs of customers. Yes, it may be crowded during the dinner time slot. But which other restaurant of a reasonable standard are not crowded during dinner time?Food wise, not up to standard. Seriously, if you want to be on par with the OTHER similar restaurant chain that serves exactly the same free flow salad, using a similar type of sauce, you guys have to do better. The pork katsu was not even cooked properly. Some portions were still slightly red, while some other parts were too tough to chew. Salmon katsu was not fresh either.For now, I'd rather patronize the OTHER restaurant chain. Thanks

Looking for a place for dinner and realized that this is a newly opened restaurant and decided to try it out as we are huge fans of tonkatsu.Great quality meat cooked to perfection for its tonkatsu. Service wise, it's pretty normal. Price wise, what one can expect for a tonkatsu restaurant

It is Friday evening and we arrived at about 730pm. We ordered two pork cutlet dons and 2 glasses of warm water. At 810pm, nothing but a bowl of raw cabbage has been served. The table next to us had been waiting for 40 minutes. There are 3 wait staff only and they are clearly on their toes. It's unfortunate that the service is a let down. The tonkatsu was really nice. Decent serving of meat, nicely breaded. The water never got served

A quick dinner with work colleagues and friends after arriving in Singapore. Place was recommended to me and I, being happy with most cuisines, went along. The place specialises in Japanese-style pork cutlets (katsu) in various shapes and with different sides. All pretty uncomplicated but tasty. The white cabbage starter with sesame sauce is great - whets the appetite without being too filling. The edamame beans were OK - a bit too discoloured and not salty enough in my opinion but the main was delicious - delicate pork with some kind of roe topping, fresh sticky rice, bowl of miso and some delicate pickles. What's not to like? The only thing I'd change a bit was the music that was a tad too loud to have a conversation
