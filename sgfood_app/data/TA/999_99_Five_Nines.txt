Service was excellent but the food was just average for the price you pay for. I'm expecting more...
5
Was impressed with the quality of the cuisine, cosy ambience, and reasonable pricing. Staff were friendly and attentive. The restaurant will be moving to Cuppage, which is a bonus as it will be next to my office. Looking forward to more delectable dinners in future.

Nice ambience, friendly staff, great food. Beef steak was nicely done . Indeed, affordable fine dining!
3
Food was not too bad however the portion is a lil on the small side. Realised the restaurant likes to use truffle oil hence it good to check first for those non truffle fans.
4
Mains are reasonably priced. Restaurant serves a mix of Euro and Jap style dishes. The ambience is cosy and the service is good.
5
Love the food nicely done and well deco.. Quiet ambient during the day just right for friends chitchat session.

We visited this restaurant as a couple in May 2017. Be prepared to pay, but also enjoy the experience of the different amazing food, watch the chefs work and bring out all sorts of different things. This was on the street just down from our hotel. We loved it ! If you can afford it, experience it
4
Yes just as what they named themselves, when the moment you entered this restaurant they have a lot of item covered in GOLD color... expect the same for your cutleries as well! It's my second visit, you will spot their chefs are pretty young and good looking. Maybe you could consider the bar table if you wish to hook someone back with you.. HahaThe food is consider pretty good for the pricing, just that i noticed whenever I asked for hot water (those free tap water) they takes forever to come, most of the time they would have forgotten and need to request for replenishment. Both of my visit I encountered the same feeling, but when comes to my sake (those which you need to pay) they are extremely attentive whenever it is finished. Desserts wise you should consider to give it a skip, and look elsewhere.

This restaurants has been one of our Singapore favourites since it opened. We wanted to bring our friend to the restaurant, but it ended up as a big disappointment. What has happened with this place? Prices gone up and quality gone down... the lobster has been one of the highlights on the menu. It was so poorly prepared. Tasted like it had been tawed. No taste, just a watery feeling to the meat. It is so sad I must say. Service was ok. At least the water compensated for the lobster not being the quality you would expect.I hope it can get back to it's old level, then I will definitely be back
5
Affordable fine dining! 5 nines we found by walking past, looked at the menu. Affordable. We were offered a counter seat, glad we were! We were able to see the chefs quietly construct our beautiful food.Fine dining portions. Respect of the produce - perfectly cooked seafood. Abundance of flavour.Delicious desserts. Highly recommen
5
Went for lunch last week. Affordable set lunch. Food was nice and the service staffs was very polite. I will definitely coming back again. Thank you!
4
After ordering the food, we had wait long time when there were 2tables only. (maybe hungry+ing). The 2nd orders came to table faster.
I recommend the lobster. That is delicious and valuable.
4
Excellent value for money Sunday lunch. Very good food and presentation, prepared by the Japanese chef. Recommended, made me feel like back in Tokyo.
4
Service is fantastic, food is good and Price is nothing to compare when the quality of the ingredient choice
3
Menu was a bit confusing and the food was just ok. I was expecting a bit more from it based on other reviews.
3
Went to Five Nines to celebrate my spouse's birthday. Restaurant have romantic ambience, service is good, but food wasn't fantastic, is average to my palet.
4
I found Five Nines while I was looking around for a restaurant I could bring my husband for his belated birthday dinner. I read a number of raves, so I thought we'd check it out. We were given seats by the bar which I initially thought was a setback, but it turned out to be the most fun because we can watch the Chef and his assistants prepare all the glorious dishes from where we were sitting. We ordered the king crab croquettes, truffle cream risotto with foie gras, UK seabass and the chocolate cake with dulce de leche - all of which were wonderfully prepared. We were also happy with the service as the staff were quite friendly and attentive. We also happen to like the easy yet charming vibe of the place. I'd say 999.99's a good discovery in Keong Saik
4
We booked a table but were given one just by the toilet and kitchen entrance with music speaker right above us! Music was way too loud, not the right type for a restaurant anyway. It was no different when we were moved to another table. We again had to request for it to be softer! NOT a good start.Portions were small even for mains! Expensive but mediocre food.Would we return? Definitely NOT! NOT recommend as wel
4
Through a friend recommendation, my friends and I decided to try 999.99.Due to that evening was packed and dining inside was not available, we had to reserve outdoor dining. However, we were very lucky as there was another 6 pack reservation made for 8.30pm, and ours was at 7pm, the helpful decided to let us have the table inside.We wanted to try the 5-course dinner set at $69+ but was unavailable, except the $139+. So we all ended up ordering ala carte. My starter was the Tiger Prawns Kadaif with Spicy Ajvar Sauce. There were crunchy yet light and yum. My main was the Spicy Chicken Diavola & Black Hummus. It was tender and juicy. Another yum. Dessert was the Green Tea Tiramisu with Caramel Popcorn. Light and yum.I really enjoyed my dinner at 999.99. Nice ambience and friendly, great service. However, the kitchen is semi open and if you are seating towards the back end, your clothes will be "smoked". But it isn't an issue at all. Just sit back and enjoy the delicious food.I will definitely be back again to try the 5 course dinner with friends

It was a Monday in Singapore. The place was not buzzing. It was dead. The bottle of wine we ordered was it available and no offer was made to substitute. There were other items on the menu that were not available. The staff had a hard time describing what was on the menu. At one point a photo arrived via an iPad. For starters we had the tuna with ponzu jelly. It was the best of the evening. The tiger prawns were average. For mains there was the snapper and the lobster gratin. Both were way over cooked and the snapper almost inedible. There was a mediocre salad with the lobster. It was not good value for money and was very ordinary cooking. We decided to skip dessert. The food also arrived so fast you have to really wonder about it. The service was get them in and get them out. They should maybe rename it 444.44
4
$99 omakase choices for main is limit to 2 beef & lamb. Since its Omakase should end before dessert with a palate cleanser drink or sorbet for better enjoyment switch room savory to sweet.
4
Interesting and delicious food. Pleasant atmosphere. Friendly service. Felt comfortable as a solo diner. Recommend $69 menu.
4
Close to Chinatown and very busy on our visit so had to sit at the bar.
Good friendly service and everyone on our party enjoyed the food. Will return!
5
A fine experience. Went on a Sunday early evening. The restuarant was still relatively quiet at that time. The crew is polite and experienced. Good ambience. Good food.
Will not hesitate to return again
3
Proteins were well cooked but dishes were average. Menu was not accurate and not descriptive enough. Service was slow.
4
The service was very quick and the waitress was very attentive and friendly! The dishes was okay, fresh but was not so exciting as you would expect in fine dining.
4
The amazing point in this restaurant is the Chef here always challenges and creates new dishes. This time the best dish was spaghetti vongole, which had a very fresh taste of parsley and tomato. On top he said he is planning to upgrade his cooking, which is more simple cooking with better materials. I am very much looking forward to trying his new style soon
4
Nice ambience! Food was quite good, but serving was not very polished. Some of us were served earlier than the others and had to wait around 10 minutes with the food turning cold before everyone was plated. Our starters were served midway during our Omakase course, which was slightly disruptive. Apart from that, the food was enjoyable and the staff were friendly
2
This restaurant is supposed to be about good food but still affordable. I guess you can say it's relatively affordable and they try hard to make it good but it misses a few important basics.First of all, the timing of when food is served is very important. It's no good serving the dish of one but not the other. I knew the moment we were seated this would be a problem. The single customer next to us had the degustation and he was still eating the prior dish when the main dish was served. Needless to say, my husband's cooked entree arrived before mine which was the beef carpaccio.Next the wine list. There are options if you have a bottle but for wine by the glass, options are pretty limited especially on the white wine. Two out of three are from Chile. One of them happened to be not available. I understand that affordability is a criteria but there are plenty of good affordable wines from Australia or New Zealand.In terms of the ambience, it's okay but they can probably try to have better exhaust system. You'd end up smelling of food by the time you're done.Service wise, it's generally okay. Some reviews complain about the service but I think it's okay except they don't readily offer the dessert menu or if you would like another drink.Last and most important of all - the food. I wouldn't consider myself picky and I have to say the food is okay but could be better. My husband had the crab croquette for entree while I had the Kagoshima carpaccio. The crab croquette was way too creamy. My carpaccio relied too much on the Japanese mayo and had fried garlic so I could hardly taste the beef. For mains, we had the lobster gratin. Understand it's gratin so it will be creamy but it's just way too creamy to our liking. The desserts were well presented but nothing special. Could've done away with them to be honest.So I think overall the concept of the restaurant is good but needs some more work. I think we're unlikely to go back
4
The 5-course dinner was fantastic for its pricing of $69++. Everything was well-cooked, with lots of different flavours and ingredients showcased. Definitely one of the top places I would consider when I want to have a good dinner, but don't want to spend too much.If I had to pick a favourite, it was the simple yet delicious Chicken Breast and Tomato Dashi - it's an extremely savoury chicken soup, enhanced by the especially sweet tomato, with fennel leaves for an extra spice
5
The chef there is always challenging new dishes.
This time, as usual, i could try new dishes and desserts.
recommend you to go there especially for those who like fusion and new "marriage".
4
Food was good. Atmosphere is nice. Waitresses were friendly and nice. Good place to chill and relax.
4
All of the food was really tasty, service was friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere. Tad on the pricey side.
4
This was pretty nice. More hits than misses. We enjoyed the capellini and lobster but the risotto was a little bland.
3
The restaurant is small and cozy, it was not full. the oysters were very good. we order 2 appetizer and 2 main courses and some snacks and an apple cider, the bill was around $100.
4
Good food and atmosphere on a Friday night. The beef was great the Paella was not so great. (similar to ambrosia creamed rice).
3
On another night this could have got a 1 or a 5. The ambiance is spot on for a semi-casual evening, and they have the lighting down to a tee, particularly at the bar. Initially the service was excellent - prompt and friendly - but this unfortunately tailed off as the waiting staff weren't great at explaining the dishes, we had to wait for cutlery after our food came, and ask for the bill a number of times. The starters of crab croquettes and octopus were pretty disappointing, and given that they arrived almost too quickly you wonder whether the prep is as it needs to be. Fortunately the main courses of lamb and lobster were both delicious, though the portions could perhaps been a little more generous. The house wine was excellent and served at just the right temperature. Basically, for a semi-casual night out it'll do the job, and there's a chance you'll be blown away... There's also the chance you'll think it's terrible!
4
The 5 course tasting menu were beautifully cooked and presented. Love the neat and harmonious plating. Every dish is special in its own way. Seasoning is just right.All the ingredients balance out and not overpowering one another. The portion is just right for a tasting menu at this price. Not too tiny and not too stuffed. You can easily add on Ala Carte item if you don't feel full after the main.The female servers are sweet and friendly but can be more attentive. Our empty plates for each course always sit for quiet a while before it was cleared. Also, the cutleries were not changed after every course. Though this is a casual dining I felt changing of silverware is necessary to not mix the flavors of different ingredients.Will definitely come again after they introduce a different 5 course menu
4
Last min reservation on sat. Had a counter seat.Pros:-Counter seat is nice as you actually see the kitchen preparing food in front of u-friendly staff-display of food is good-selection is interesting as well-price is reasonable Cons:-counter seat is not for private talks as its v open and the seats are v close to each other - parking maybe be hard as the street parking is limited Overall it's def a place to go with friends, couple or family.The lobster gratin is really yummy

On 13/1 , I brought a friend to dine in Five Nines , having enjoyed the food on a previous visit. When I asked for the bill , it was brought to me within 5 minutes with the waitress asking us to pay cash because the machine is not working. My bill was $317.00. In this cashless society who will carry so much cash. I was shocked ! May I suggest that the supervisor in this restaurant be more sensitive to such hiccups. The supervisor should have handled such situation by explaining to the customer that the machine is not working would we mind waiting for a while for the connection to come back. At least you give an option to the customer ! Instead of asking for cash , they even tell me I could withdraw from the nearby 7eleven , the best was yet to come , the connection came back within 5 min (by then I was at 7eleven queuing to withdraw!)Honestly , I wouldn't patronise this place again however good the food is 
5
Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves dining here. The 5 course meal was spectacular and worth every cent. Would definitely come back again!
5
A must go place! Good food and the staff are very accomodating and understanding. Very good place for dates
4
The ambiance and food was really nice. Was a wonderful cosy dinner experience. Will definitely return.
5
They called to confirm my reservation! I felt important, even though it was a last minute "chope". Hehe. When we turn up, the service met my expectations. We enjoyed the dinner very much. Thanks for having us!
2
I took my hubby there to celebrate his birthday. The dishes we ordered were hit and miss affairs. The lobster gratin was ok but not great. The other dishes were also pretty average. Some we thought were not well flavoured enough. A little disappointing given the prices.
3
Food was average. Order 3 poster gratin and 1 beef ribeye , was informed that ribeye was not available and changed to sirloin. Dish was just acceptable. Might have over anticipated due to the reviews . The waitresses were too busy. Requested for a cup of water twice and till I left , it was still not served .
3
- restaurant was absolutely freezing! Others also complained about the temperature so it wasn't just us- wines were under stocked and the ones we wanted weren't available. They need to be more prepared and better stocked- food was really good- the Omakase meal wasn't necessarily the most affordable option. My Husband ordered 4 courses from the a la carte menu plus bread (including the lobster gratin which is an additional $15 with the Omakase meal) and it was still cheaper than my Omakase meal. So make sure you order the dishes you want and not necessarily order the set meals just because
4
Restaurant is very cosy and beautiful decor , Food is nice especially the Lobster. I went because I saw there is a promotion for the Lobster some time ago butter promotion was over already and we still order the Lobster never regrets we did because it was beautiful done n worth it even without t promotion. We will visit again
3
Good and very friendly service but a mixed review of the different courses by our family members. Most found the starter sauce too salty, the chicken & polenta was met with differing views, but all agreed that the main and dessert were both good. Street side parking was a challenge though.
5
I brought my European guest who is an avid foodie, traveling to Singapore for business purpose twice a year for the past 30 years, to Five Nines. And he LOVES it!!!Five Nines did a fantastic job in, not only serving him the lovely food but also making his dining experience a pleasant one. The cheerful host entertained every question he had, from wines to food to dessert and the waitresses were super attentive even though there was quite a busy night for the restaurant.Their King Crab Croquette and Lobster Gratin tasted surprisingly light in a good way. The King Crab Croquette tasted so fluffy and foamy, it didn't leave the oily aftertaste in my mouth. The Lobster Gratin was done so perfectly that both of us almost fought for the last piece. I can't help but noticed that Five Nines knows their ingredient well, I like that they keep the texture of the food as original as possible. The steak bites we ordered were tender while the octopus had a springy yet firm texture. Also be sure to leave some space for their dessert, everything is home made in the restaurant!Not only we love the food, we also love the fact that the bustling kitchen didn't create any loud noise and they keep the music at a reasonable volume so that we can still hear each other talking. Extra brownie points
4
Food was good and preparation was fast! The tables were abit too close to the next table beside us.
Will be bk!
4
The 5-course set dinner was affordable and well-plated. However, portions might be too small for some people.
5
Excellent service and food. Tried the lobster and steak. Portions are not huge though. Will be back to try other mains.
5
Dropped in as passing by on a Tuesday night. Quick service nice resturant. We ordered variety of items. Cevice, Brazilian bread, rib eye, red wines, pasta carbons, and lobster crocs. All good, enjoyed all. Missed some items from our order but not missed since we were content with all food amount for three.
4
I booked Five Nines to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was our first time there. We were surprised that they allowed us to share an omakase menu together an ala carte dish because we had late lunch. The food was amazingly good especially the lobster gratin as main course. Another interesting dish was the beef carpaccio with miso jelly cubes â€“ we were impressed with the East meets West fusion. We would definitely revisit this restaurant again, this time with empty stomachs
3
Food ok - we chose a sample menu - decent price, but service was rushed, with literally no time between one dish and the other (5 in total), so that table can be freed up fast, despite plenty of empty tables.Already at reservation point was given to understand that at my preferred time (7.15pm) only counter was available, so i should come at 6.30. First booked at 6.30, then had to move back to 7.15, and suddenly they found a table. Stayed in restaurant until 8.30+ (rushed!) and still at least 4 tables empty. This is what leaves a bitter taste despite a possibly good menu. Too ba
4
Food portion is really tiny though (therefore the 4 stars instead of 5). Luckily the food's good! We had the tagliatelle creamy lobster and there were plenty of lobster bits in it. Sauce was lobster bisque I believe. The restaurant is quite small, so if you're a group of 2, chances are you'll be seated at the counter.
5
Nice ambient and excellent service. Love their new menu especially the Scallop Tartar Truffle Flavour with a glass of wine. Perfect match!! A nice place for meet up with friends and family. Most important the service crew know what you want.. If you prefer a quiet environment will be ideal to come during weekdays
5
Came here on a Friday night with a couple of other girl friends. We didn't order the set menu as we weren't that hungry, but it seemed like a good deal though (5 courses for $69++). Wine prices were also relatively reasonable, and staff was super friendl
3
Food so so, very tiny serving! I don't know I was a little surprised when I see the size of my food.The only thing I like about the restaurant is that they serve our food fast. That probably because not many customers in the shop.(At 840pm)Cant say I am terribly unhappy but I don't think I will come here again.They need to do a lot more in order to compete with many restaurants out there
5
Japanese head chef. Amazing western food. Great set menu at an affordable price. One of the items was its signature lobster gratin - phenomenal and that without a doubt was the best dish of the night and worth coming back for again and again
4
The experience was a good one given that the service crew is very attentive and the food is prepared really well as well.
4
Good food for the price. Only downside is the aircon which blows directly at some seats. Wonder why the owner dont want to adjust it such that it blows upwards, definitely possible.
3
Had lunch with friends at this modern Gastrobar, the lobster was a disppointment, salad & beef just average, soup was good, service staff avearge, wasn't so attentive.
3
When you have tried some of the Michelin star restaurant in Japan you will realize that 999.99 is a bit average. This is a place to start warming to the real heavy weights
4
Nicely decorated place with attention to detail. Staff were friendly and attentive. Portion served was reasonable and delectable.
4
nice ambient, staff very friendly and very nice environment. Just that the overall area space is a bit small thus can understand why it will be so crowded. Food was very good but portion not big especially the Burata Cheese, the smallest portion i ever eaten... haha.
3
Went here at the recommendation of a number of friends who raved about the food. Unfortunately, we left very disappointed. We opted for the 5 course set menu and found the servings very small and I was still hungry afterwards. The courses were OK, though I've had better. Will take a lot of persuasion to go back agai
3
Dined at this restaurant on 5 August 2016. Arrived at the restaurant almost 2 pm and restaurant almost empty. Was assigned a table next to a couple in a cramped space and politely requested to sit at the table behind it but was rejected??? I did not see the rationale why it can't be done and honestly this is the first time a restaurant did not accede to my request for an available seat of my choice (see attached pictures).No the table was not reserved by someone else and no explanation given.My mood was already spoilt how happy do you think my palate will be? Dining is not just about the food but the whole dining experience with the service rendered. Anyway to be honest the food was not good either. Had their lobster set lunch using Groupon and the lobster was bland, covered with melted cheese with meager amount of lobster meat. The potato soup was very small portion too definitely not an satisfying meal in terms of quality and quantity
4
For some reason the a la carte menu was different from what I saw on their website, so we ordered the king prawn kadaif, king crab croquettes, lobster gratin and steak with foie gras. Just thought the gratin was not value for money because it's clearly not a full lobster, probably a half. Otherwise, the food was fresh. We sat by the counter and there was not really an atmosphere, and it was freezing
5
Check out 999.99 Classic 5-Course August Menu! Only available during dinner, a touch of light, refreshing two courses to start with. Excellent food, ambience & service! Definitely not a one time visit only, worth your time & $$!
4
Food is delicious and service is great. Staff are attentive towards our needs. I would like to recommend their lobster gratin and tiramisu.
4
Friendly staff and nice ambience. You have to walk a little if you are taking public transport but that doesn't matter if you are there for their signature lobster gratin. They serve nice starter and do try their tiramisu!
4
Dishes here are always improving and cost performance is extremely good in Singapore.
Sure to return soon.
4
the set lunch is either $1990 for the signature gratin lobster or $29.90 for a 4 course menu without the lobster. we upgraded the 4 course set lunch to include the lobster for $10 more .excellent decision . The set even includes good coffee.
3
beautifully plated, but taste-wise, only 2 out of 6 items really wowed us - the beef tenderloin with truffle shavings & foie gras, and the mushroom risotto. we were underwhelmed by the lobster gratin and king crab croquettes.
5
Had a groupon voucher for lobster gratin. Totally worth the price for it.Place was simple yet elegant. Place wasn't pack or busy when I arrived.I was rather skeptical how a diner can provide lobster at such a low price but i was blown by this dish. You can really taste the lobster meat in this gratin.All in all a great deal. I look forward to having another set course lunch at five nines
4
Came here for lunch earlier in the week and opted for the 4 course set lunch at $29++. Surprised to find the place totally packed, but luckily we could squeeze into one of the outside tables. The food was really good and the service friendly and efficient. Overall quite good value
3
Had lunch here to try the signature lobster gratin!Quite nicely done though do not expect lots of lobster meat for the price you are paying so manage your expectations.Lunch set for steak or lobster gratin comes with a drink. Option to top of $5++ for soup of the day
5
I had dinner on a Saturday night with my wife. The service was some of the best we've had in Singapore, and the food and wine was just as good. Everything we ordered was fantastic and the highlight was most definitely the risotto. It was enjoyable to watch the food being made through the open kitchen. We will definitely be back again.
4
Had a great time, celebrated 2 friend's birthday and they all enjoyed themselves. Food and service were excellent and we'll definitely be back! Must order- oysters and lobster pasta...
3
It's a place you would once in while go of you want or treat yourself during working day lunch hour instead of being food court or coffee shop!
4
Suggested the chef interact more with the guest . For example explain the dishes and what is their special of the day or so on.
4
Food was Delicious! I can't believe So cheap! But staff need a more experience to look after the customer.
5
We had lobster gratin and Beef steak with foie Gras. The lobster is amazing, big chunk and just cheesy enough. The beef is tender and melting with the foie gras. Wine is good too. Nice ambience and service.
4
Went there for lunch and had the Lobster Gratin set purchased through Groupon. The lobster was good and so was the fries. Green pea soup was also tasty. There should have been a complimentary coffee thrown in to round up the meal
5
Nice option for dinner if you feel like having something out of the ordinary at reasonable prices (Set Dinner Menu at SGD69) within fine dining.
4
999.99 is the gold standard, and this is what the restaurant is attempting to achieve.The restaurant serves European cuisine with the Japanese dedication to kaizen, which refers to continuous improvement. Take the Lamb Chops and Eggplant. It arrives, all dramatic, under a bell jar filled with smoke, which when lifted, invites you to inhale the char-grilled smokiness of the lamb. But that little piece of drama doesn’t take away the fact that you have three juicy, perfectly pink lamb chops, oozing with flavor and all for just, $22.The Lobster Gratin, too, is another good example of quality at a reasonable price. At only $19, you get a creamy, cheesy gratinated half lobster and it is delicious. The King Prawn Kadaif ($16), too, is good as a starter. Light-as-air shredded filo pastry envelopes the prawns and it’s a yummy, crispy dish.There are some dishes that could do with a portion upgrade, particularly the paella and cheese platter, which are so minimalistic, compared to the prices being charged, it doesn't add up at all.All in all, the flavours are definitely there and 999.99 is worth a try
4
Buratta and tomato salad was light and refreshing, lobster gratin was not too cheesy, truffle risotto with foie gras was super creamy and cooked well, tiramisu was yum. No complains about the food at all. Ok the risotto portion was a little smaller than I had expected. But for the price... It's ok! No complains about service too. Attentive and fast.
3
We dined in a group of 7 for my friend's birthday this month. The write ups for this restaurant pitch it at good value / affordable fine dining, but you'll be a little disappointed if this is what you expect.Food - we had the 5 course dinner menu for $59.99 and I paid and extra $20 to upgrade to the Lobster Gratin and Beef Rossini. While I enjoyed both these courses and dessert, the flavours fall short of what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant - both courses seemed to be reheated instead of freshly cooked. The other 2 courses were not very memorable, but the pistachio dessert had a very interesting combination of flavours and textures.Service - it was a Saturday night and we had to wait a little too long between courses, this really drew time out. The staff are quite inexperienced and the level of service is that of a mid range restaurant. On the minus side, we had to ask the waitress 3 times before she brought a glass for my friend's prosecco. On the plus side, they knew it was my friend's birthday and they brought her a delicious complimentary rich chocolate dessert with a lit sparkler and sang her happy birthday.All in all, an enjoyable dining experience but not somewhere I'd return to again
5
Food was great and service was prompt. Set lunch was value for money and we had an enjoyable time. Restaurant's ambience was modern and it's a great place for a business lunch or just with some good friends or family.
5
the place is really nice. the food is excellent . very nice presentation of the dishes.
a must , open kitchen to discover the secret of the cooking.
4
nice ambience, good food (portions are adequate for the price, but guys may need to order more) = value for money
4
I went to this place last Thu for lunch. The place was super quiet. I was only 5 customers including me. The ambiance was nice and classy. A little dark on lightning. It would probably be perfect for date night.My lobster gratin and lobster soup was very good.The service by the long hair lady at starting point to the end was friendly.Set Lunch price started at 26 which quite good. Definitely would pop by again next time
5
Decided to try out this hip place after seeing my friends' postings on Facebook! What can I say?? Love every single thing that I put into my mouth The set dinner was totally worth it and so mouth watering! 5 course for $59-$79 ++ With so much competition along that stretch, this is definitely a front runner in my opinion. The lobster gratin and beef is a must try!!! And the organic wine too...
3
Service level needs to be improved. We were brought to the bar counter. We asked for about 2 times (long pauses in-between) before they came over and took our order. After introducing the dishes and getting our order, the waitress came back 2 mins later, and told me she forgot my order completely. She was busy checking with the chef on my friend's special request and forgot what I ordered. While their attitude were friendly, I just found this to be a service gap, especially we had to remind them twice that we want to order. Food were not completely wow. For the price, it's ok. Not a place I put on my to-go list. Bar counter was very tight and not suitable if you are of a bigger size
1
Asparagus soup was dilute and blandFish carpparcio was awfulMain course: Fish was over cooked hence meat was tough; Beef was well done when I asked for med rare.Tiramisu is still ok.most importantly, service was BAD BAD BAD. Made reservation via CHOPE and indicated my request for a birthday cake during dessert but obviously that was not noted. no mention of my special request and I had no chance to ask for it at the resto since my business partner was there with me. When asking for bill, I had to ask for it a few times and finally this waitress, Herni, saw my waving hands, not even a smile of acknowledgement, she gave it a stare as acknowledgement and then turn towards cashier to the bill, then walk over to our table. She then just present the bill without a word. conclusion: A COMPLETELY DISGUSTED EXPERIENCE
5
Bottom line: Excellent food, original dishes, very friendly service. And not to forget a surprisingly nice wine list. Obviously not cheap, but there is good choice.The taste of food is really nice. Restaurant sitting also nice as you can sit at the bar, or just at tables or even outside on high tables. Service is also great. I mentioned to one of the chefs already, they may add some more bread at the dishes and npt just one slice. When it comes to wine by the glass, I rather have you increase the price and give me a decent glass. You have to make reservations well in advance. In the weekend days and I mean Thu/Fri/Sat evening, this place is packed

Date night and since the lady is paying and I want to impress the date, and after much rave by friends about this resto, I decided ro check it out.We each had the set menu which is 5 courses, and we were totally impressed with the selection.... 2 mains: lobster gratin and steak, and all for $59++ (Of course if you opt for the lobster, then you just top up $10). But it was still a steal!!!!Best to book early, as it can be quite difficult to get seats. We were only given the option of either 6pm or 8:45pm on a Saturday night. I heard even on weekdays, they can be fully booked out! The set menu may change so if you want to enjoy the whole lobster, don't wait!

We choose the 4-course set lunch at S$29++ for our birthday celebratory meal. The appetiser of tomato and bursts and the pea soup were good but the main course of beef tenderloin came up as the best! The meal also provided a tiramisu dessert and free drink! Recommended as value for money and worth a try! Service and ambience are also good
