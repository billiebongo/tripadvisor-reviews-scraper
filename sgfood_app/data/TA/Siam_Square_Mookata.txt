The sauce is nice and value for money. I ordered ala carte instead of buffet and only cost me $12 per pax as i not a big eater. The food is fresh and i will come back again for sure.

I love this place - the food is always delicious and extremely value for money, service is always great and the serving portions are really generous. I have visited this place so many times but never once did it fail me.

This is in a food court, bad ventilation , the table is too small to put the food, without the sauces to dip, doesn't taste Thai at all. Expensive for the small portion charged. Won't go anymore
