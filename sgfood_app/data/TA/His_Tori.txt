Easy place to drop into when you are just walking the streets. Whether you just want a quick drink while still watching the streets or if you want a nice meal, this can be the place for you!

Very basic and extremely good value. The only thing I disliked it was the chilli sauce. Usually with BBQ like this you expect a nicer dipping sauce

Worth the money spent. 24$ per pax for buffet. Clean, tastety, cozy and attentive staffs. Dinner buffet starts from 5 pm.

Food - freshly prepared cooked food good to have while waiting for the BBQ
Atmosphere - feels like a home, a canteen, very casual, comfort food.

We were strolling the streets close to our hotel and discovered this little bar and decided to stop for a beer.So glad we did.The owner was very gracious in her hospitality and it was a nice surprise.The bar was meticulously clean and the beer was cold.I highly recommend.Juliet from Tasmania Australia

The selection is good and after the renovation, the meat stuff are now all pre-packed and placed in a refrigerator, much more hygienic than placing them out in a big container outside.The service is quite ok and they are quite fast with replacing the aluminum cover foil. Taste good and it's very value for money!My favourite is the beef short ribs and bulgogi

I came here after reading more than 600 reviews from the local forum and decide to make reservation for 10people yesterday. Basically this restaurant served buffet spread for Japanese and korean bbq buffet. There are a stretch of restaurant at this area with korean buffet.Location: This is my first time here and do find it a little difficult to walk from chinatown mrt. The restaurant is an aircon place. Drink: One plus point is their home-made detox drink which is a mixed of different fruits, i.e. strawberry, apple, cucumber, peppermint leaves, orange. It taste good. They do have other choice of soft drinks too and it is included in the buffet.Food: We can choose the types of meat to bbq and what I like are: miso chicken, teriyaki chicken. They have porks, fish, prawn, chicken and beef spread to bbq. Also they have ready made food. I like their dumpling, and korean pancake. They do have chicken nuggets, pork. Dessert: The milk pudding taste good and also their ice-cream has unique flavour of blackberry ice cream. Service: The staff proactive ask to change the bbq plate if it turn black and at times i realise they are quick to clear the plates on the table politely. Overall a great place for gathering to sit together to have bbq together.And comparing other buffet, the price is rather good at $22+per pax which is really a good deal to have many food selection
