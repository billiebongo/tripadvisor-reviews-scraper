Great coffee. Friendly service. Nice place to relax if in the area. We come by often to purchase coffee beans.

Nice place to grab a good cup of coffee and quick breakfast on the way to work or after a workout love the breads and croissants and location

I generally continue to think that Jewel is the best of the chain coffee outlets in Singapore. Just my 2nd visit to the Claymore Connect outlet this week, but quality is the same as elsewhere. Pretty little design in my cappuccino. No complaints.

Despite several choices of coffee there was NO decaff coffee available. The cheapest water was $5 which is not cheap. The view was poor. Food was OK.

Definitely my preferred coffee chain in Singapore. Double shot coffees as standard, so no need to worry about overly milky coffee. I like the outlet at Claymore Connect as there's plenty of space to sit and have a chat over a decent coffee. Stopped here last week after lunch for another visit and was again very happy with the experience

I love this place quietly located at thr Claymore Connect at the Ground level of Orchard Hotel Building. The place is very well decorated and happening. You can spend hours at the plsce with nice cup of coffee( they have wide choice of coffee) and a sandwich. I spend this time with a cup of Americano and 1 english muffin bread with egg and turkey bacon. The dish was served hot and very well prepared. Nice place to quietly unwind

Scrambled eggs with mushrooms and pancakes with fruit became our staple breakfast orders. Plus tea and either hot or cold chocolate drinks. Service was good, food was good, iced chocolate was ok but hot chocolate was only chocolate syrup based. Drinks were pick up from the counter but food was delivered to our table. Overall a good spot close to our accommodation where we had a window view of the comings and goings on Claymore Road

We are expats living in Singapore since 2000- coming from NZ we love a good flat white. When we moved close to Claymore Connect we were delighted when Jewel Coffee opened up in our neighbourhood. This cafe is so very aptly named as it truly is a jewel of a cafe. Being regulars here we are not only impressed with the coffee we are super impressed with the manageress Eliza. We have just returned form a month in NZ and a month in France and Spain and the thing we missed most was Jewel~ the fantastic coffee and Elizah. After arriving back in Singapore last last night and fighting jet lag this morning our very first destination was to Jewel for a caffeine shot and a wonderful "welcome home" from the outstanding staff at Jewel. Keep up the great work Jewel @ Claymore Connect we love you in the neighbourhood!

Found this little cafe whilst walking out the back of the Orchard Hotel. Much cheaper than the hotel breakfast with the best Almond Croissant I have ever tasted. The coffee is excellent too with a choice of beans, the Brazilian was good and a cute design on the top. A limited menu but there are some traditional eggy breakfast dishes on the menu. A buzzy atmosphere but not much of a view

OK, it's in a weird location, but we have a reason to be there so we sit an watch. My recommendation is to get a bench seat early Sunday morning and watch the interactions out of Orchard Towers. Ambulance? Check. Six police cars? Check. Stop and search? Check. One more for the road? Check. I don't know why we do this every week...Putting that aside, the coffee here is fantastic. Almost the best in Singapore. If you don't like the outside there is a nice sitting area inside. The pastries are very good, and while we've never tried it, they do normal food too (and eggs, etc. for breakfast)

Tucked away, colourful people-watching, and the best darn coffee on the west side of Scotts Road. Recommend the Gibraltar, for something suitable coffee-ish :)

Great coffee! You get to select the beans that you want to have. Try the brazil beans if they have them. The food is limited, but of a great quality

Soggy croissant, over priced so-so cafe latte and slow counter service.
Much as I don't like Starbucks, it would have been better choice.
5
Coffee was high quality, many varieties to choose from. So glad I found this place, it lived up to my Melbourne coffee expectations.

We stayed at the orchard hotel next door and rather than buy their expensive breakfasts we went to jewel Cafe. Great food.

Jewel Coffee was a great find. Passionate barista's who really get it! So great that Singapore's coffee scene is not all massive multi-national chains. They also have a lovely range for light snacks and lunch. Go there if you are up the Taglin end of Orchard - or even if you're nowhere near it!

Your coffee is great, your pastries are also really good but honestly the price of your babycino is shocking! Starbucks and Costa give it for free. You may say that your babycino is 12oz of milk... but kids will not drink so much milk anyway! Speak to your manager and make sure you compare yourself to the market. Just a bit of foam and cocoa powder free for your kids clients will make a huge difference

Heard about this and tried it after applying for a visa at the Thai Embassy, close walking distance. The selection of coffee is not much but good coffee nevertheless. Additional options for various brewing method also available... V60, Siphon, Chemex. Will try this next time.Had a latte and an americano. Nice latte art and they know how to make coffee.We also had eggs benedict and it was very good. Simple, just a small side salad and 2 pcs of eggs. They do something different with some sort of whipped creamy something on top. Thought it was cheese but something much lighter. Nice If you're looking for good coffee and simple good brunch, try this place

Came here today for some coffee (having been to the other 3 outlets, I was keen to finish off the selection by also visiting the outlet at Claymore Rd). Coffee was just as good as at the other locations. Today I opted for the Brazilian coffee, and the usual cappuccino. One of the better places for coffee in Singapore

1st time trying out Jewel Coffee as i did not know they have opened a new branch in Claymore Connect, behind and connecting to Orchard Hotel.. the ever popular coffee hangout (Jewel Coffee) with cyclists is at Shenton Way.We ordered Latte and Capuccino and both were equally good ! Side order Kurobota Pork Sausage is very good but the scambled eggs were a bit let down as it tasted very bland... ! A very laid back outlet (outdoor sitting) facing the infamous Orchard Towers ..

We used this lovely little place a few times while staying at The Orchard Hotel. They serve good beers in the evening. The breakfasts are delicious and very good value. Lovely friendly staff who make you feel very welcome. Free wi-fi.

Hidden away but good service. We had a snack lunch here, with good food & good service. Difficult to find, we just happened to stumble on it.

Good standard of coffee,highly recommended for people who look for REAL coffee. Friendly and warm service by the pro staffs there. Like it !

The coffee is soooo good and the food, especially the red velvet cheesecake is super nice ðŸ˜‹ great place to study too! The baristas are well mannered and made me feel welcomed

We ate at the Jewel twice whilst staying at the Orchard Hotel The first time we had a chicked and Mayo sandwich, which was lovely and fresh, but the second time, the bread was hard and stale. The other meal of a ham and cheese melt was OK. The staff exchanged it for something else, but a bit reluctantly. Didn't go back for a third time

If you are from Australia, as I am, and used to good quality coffee, this is Australian-standard coffee and some pastries/sandwiches. Beware prices are more expensive than Australia, with Singapore $6 for a large flat white coffee. Still better than Starbucks, which is even more expensive, Most western style coffee shops will charge 10% service charge + 6% GST, which makes it expensive coffee

Every time I've been here the staff have been rude and unhappy. I've been cut off multiple times when ordering and get an overall vibe that they're doing me a favor by taking my order. Maybe don't work in customer service if you don't like dealing with people? Just a thought. Drinks are overpriced for what you get. Could get a better drink at Starbucks next door for less. The cafe does have a cool ambiance and that's the only thing it really has going in its favor. Won't be returning mainly because of the rude service.

1st day in Singapore and a great breakfast. This place is a gold mine just out side the orchard hotel. Food was excellent quality and wholesome. The breakfast was also very good value at 13$ for Singapore. Tea was also very nice and refreshing. Thanks for the experience will be back soon
5
A cozy cafe hidden in the outskirts of orchard. If you in for good coffee, that is a cafe you should not miss. You can choose from a selection of coffee beans and the food is great too! A cozy place have good coffee and chill out with friends. Love their latte art too

This is a must go place for locals and people visiting Singapore. They offer decent coffee and craft beers. What I love the most is the single origin coffees which the reason why I am there. More than that are the reasonably priced breakfast varieties! A place for a lazy soul to chill and unwind
