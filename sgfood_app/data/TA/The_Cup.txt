I remembered I have 2 more orders ($2 discount!) to use on Waitrr hence decided to give The Cup a try. Ordered the Bulgogi Fried Noodle and Honey Mid Wings! Strongly recommend the Mid Wings!

I often go to The Cup, either for eat in or takeaway, and both are quick and tasty options. There are a good range of options, and the manager is a nice guy who engages with his customers. I love their spicy chicken!

We walked past this place just as we were thinking about having some Korean food, and decided to take a chance on it. I had their bibimbap, my dining companion had their vegan pasta option, and we shared their recommended new item (garlic cheese fries), with hot barley tea on the side. Personally, I really enjoyed my bibimbap -- it was fresh and flavourful, and I particularly liked the yellow rice. The fries were good as well. For the pasta, the sauce was rich and creamy but a bit too cloying after a while. As for atmosphere, the place is clean and quiet, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Overall we both enjoyed dining here and wouldn't mind coming back again if we're in the area
