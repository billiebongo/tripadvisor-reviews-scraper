Excellent fish and chips cooked perfectly. The Bombay fish and chips were lightly spiced - taste without the heat.

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Add staff that seemed to not care if we were there, to the point that they practically yanked the menu out of our hands after we ordered, and you get a very unsatisfying meal.

Wide range to choose from and everything fried (calamaris and fish&chips) were incredibly crispy. The pizza "was the best one I've eaten, better than the ones I've had in Italy". Friendly staff and cozy environment.

This Cafe is located on the bottom floor of the Paragon. You have to go down two escalators to get to it. Once you arrive just line up and if there is a table available you will be taken to it. You will receive a normal menu and an Ipad to make your order. Try ordering the Seafood Platter for 1 as you will get a few different seafood to try with also chips and rice. It is quite delicious and you will not be disappointed. If you like can also order a Seafood Platter for 2. With the Seafood Platter you also receive a soup and can also order a salad. Once you have ordered on the Ipad it will not take too long for your meal to come to be enjoyed. You can also order a Pizza here also. This restaurant is at a few different locations at Singapore such as Orchardgateway so it is easy to locate.

Fish & Co has a make over since we last visited Singapore last year and is more spacious offering more seating.The menu hasnâ€™t changed much and we opted for our usual fish & chips and seafood pasta. We keep returning here as our little boy enjoys the fish and chips here. Food quality remains good. Apart from the make over, the restaurant also has new staff who are more friendly. They were as efficient as the previous staff and our food was served promptly after ordering. The meal for 2 adults and 1 child cost approx. S$70. Pretty pricey for a Fish & Chips shop but expected for Singapore.

Overall, this is a place to bring family out for dinner. This is a place for seafood lovers. Location : basement level, within the paragon mall. Food: fresh seafood. You will know from the first bite. Then tenderness and sweetness of seafood is there. Price of food in menu: above SGD20, and expect spending SGD40-50 for a meal/person. Portion of food is big.

A few months ago, I had the seafood aglio olio pasta at the Vivocity branch. It was really nice then. This time I tried the same dish at this outlet and was very disappointed by it. Seems there is no consistent quality in the food at the different outlets.This time round, I ordered the fried calamari, the seafood aglio olio pasta and a Holland fish and chips.The calamari rings were very small, unlike what was shown on the picture in the menu (large rings). However, it was nice. My aglio olio pasta was cooked rightly but the seasonings were not done well. It was dry and not much of the fish sauce taste that I had at the Vivocity branch.The fish and chips started off nice but interests in it dwindled halfway through. It gets a bit boring.Overall, the food experience, at least in this outlet, wasn't good

was there on the weekend and was supremely satisfied with the quick service . Had their famous Swiss fish and chips which are to die for. loved the vibrant environment as it's inside the mall . although the restaurant was crowded , the wait staff was extremely quick in providing the service and super friendly .

I love my seafood, so when I spotted this restaurant I was delighted. Looked at the menu, with its much talk of how dedicated they are to serving only the best quality, best prepared fish.... Fine, but what fish, it did not say. I asked a waiter what fish is used in your fish and chip specials. The reply 'white fish sir'. Which white fish? 'Ask our manager sir'. To the manager, which fish? 'White fish sir'. Which white fish though? 'I don't know, all they tell us sir is white fish'...... I left without ordering 'white fish' which the management clearly seem to have no real interest or passion in

Lots of options here so unless you hate every form of seafood, you will find something you like2 adults and 2 kids and we mainly enjoyed our orders. The fried fish was a bit on the greasy side but all in all good food. The grilled white fish was really tastyService was ok, not bad but not great either. Not sure why staff seemed grumpy all the time, felt so unwelcoming
3
Though service was quite fast, the price is a bit pricey considering the average meal that you will be getting.

An average place for food. Kind of fast food in a better ambience with service. Nothing fanciful, nothing bad.. Can try.
5
It was our nth time dining here and the food remains delicious. They have added new choices on their menu such as pizza. We did try the black pepper pizza and find it very nice. The usual platters are still available. They also serve pasta and have kids meal too. For sure you would leave this place satisfied with your meal

One may think that dining venues located in shopping malls do not usually promise anything much, but this time we craved this comfort food and opted for different kinds to share. The swiss f&c was tasty and had mozzarella cheese inside that added extra creamy texture to the fish. Their signature dish tasted very well and the batter was crispy with lovely sauce on the side. Apparently we ordered a combo, so it came with mushroom soup (also soup of the day) that gave such an earthy flavors, whilst chopped parsley added some freshness to it. The ipad order system is easy to use and (opposite to their hot dishes) the service was rather cold, which maybe due to ipads. All in all, a well deserved and solid four star establishment.
5
This place was just super comfort food. Service albeit a bit slow was compensated by its mouth watering seafood. The mussells, succulent grilled squid, cheese clams were fantastic starters. My seafood pizza was super good. Complete seafood on a bed of cheese. My in laws ordered the grilled salon. Was grilled perfectly and mixed vegetable tempuras was a delightful addition.

Good improvement in service and what most important is the food quality and taste. We order the best Fish & Chips and Seafood Platter. The food is perfectly cook. Waiting time is around 15 mins, a bit long, but it was worth waiting for. Will definitely be back other tim

Good food, the restaurant is very cold though so you tend to shiver after awhile so it is suggested that you take a small jersey to keep you warm. It wasn't the greatest restaurant but it was good! Food delicious, portion sizes smaller than we thought but a good meal! Not something I would rave about.

We went to Fish & Co Paragon for an early dinner before our walkabout to look at Orchard Road Christmas lights. This was our 4th visit and the restaurant was packed as usual even though it was 6pm. We ordered the scallop, salad, mix platter and soup for starters. For mains, I ordered the fish and chips while my wife ordered spaghetti marinara. For dessert we ordered the chocolate fudge. The food portions are large and everything tasted great. Fish & Co also serve the largest chocolate drink around. It's HUGE!! At least 2 liters easily.The service is also very fast and efficient. Service staff are nice and friendly. Only problem with this restaurant is its rather pricey for a fish & chips shop. Our bill came to about S$106.00 for the meal. Overall Fish & Co has good food but it's pricey.

Our party of three had lunch there & orderedTheir grilled white fish with ebiko, white fish &salmon and swordfish with spicy mango sauce.Service was polite, friendly and prompt.Ordering is via tablet, you yourself is to beblamed if you make errors in your order then!The white fish served is dory fish.All mains comes with two sides, I chose roastedpumpkin & coleslaw.The fish is fresh & nicely grilled. Nothing fancywith their dishes.Now the swordfish dish, the portion is large !I had a taste but I fi d the swordfish to be toooily for my taste.With drinks, our total bill came up to SGD 76, thisafter a 10% credit card promotion

The place was cozy and simple. We had the baked barramundi. Fish was fresh and tasty. Just about the right seasoning. The others had fish and chips. I have not seen this much variety of fish and chips. Sadly almost all varieties use dory which is not my favourite
5
I ended up eating here most of the time during my visit.
Freshly made, clean and tasty both the sea food and chicken.
Indefinitely recommend it.
4
Staff are friendly and the foods were delightful. I love the ambience and the way waiters explained the menu and recommended certain foods.
5
Good service & excellent food. Perfectly cooked fish & not oily at all. The location just across from our hotel was terrific. Lots of people were having semi-business dinners near us & it was a good choice. Quiet without being dull
5
The service in a timely fashion and the quality of the food was really great, the staff were attentive and the area was clean, I had a great meal

Great fish, and seafoods cooked to perfection in an interesting food court atmosphere near Tokishamya. You are encouraged to order on ipad but there is a comprehensive menu in the shape of book also. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly and courteous. A very pleasant dinner and very well cooked and flavoursome fish dishes

we were served quickly, and enjoyed our choices, although one of us found the sauce a little too spicy.We wanted a quick and easy meal and we were satisfied.The only complaint was that the air con was too high, had to wear a fleece

Sometimes a queue but that is common in Singapore. While waiting they offer you the menu to select. They still have the tablet iPad to order you food. Which they double check. I don't like this way but I know how to make it work. my new usual is grilled calamari (best ever) and Mediterranean pollock (tasty with garlic gloves) and prawn platter for one which is great too. They have fresh chopped chilli they call peri peri which should just be called crushed fresh chilli. They have large wide menu which may cater for vegetarians in way of a pasta or pizza. Wait. The salmon is also a core choice. Excellent. They not shy with their serving portions. The mash is creamy and Cole slaw is tangy. Vegetables are so so okay. Drinks are smart and large sized when ordered from personal menu. This place really has lots to offer. Plus the service is good for singapore standards. There fish n Co at paragon mall is a great stop. Tip: many don't like the fish and chips option. I presume the English style batter does not suit everyone's needs. I didn't like it the first time I ate it a few years back. Suggest you try the many other options. ENJOY !!!

We first saw Fish & Co on Penang Road (Somerset road) and it looked dark from outside, so even when my wife asked me to check it out, I kind of disapproved it. 15 mts later, we were in Paragon basement and we saw Fish Co bustling with people and it was already 9:30 late by Singapore standards. We saw the menu and immediately asked for Table, we were escorted to a nice corner one and a card as well as an electronic menu on tablet was provided with the server asking us to order electronically. cool... we selected the Shahruk Khan style fish and a combo of chicken and grilled shrimps. The fish was good though oily but the chicken and prawns combo was just amazing. nice thing is that the servers would come and reconfirm the order twice- thrice and would be immediately attentive when signaled. Very good experience
2
Honestly there are much better alternatives to the food served at Fish & Co. It's a chain and that can't be an excuse for lower food standards than a stand alone restaurant would have. The breading was oily and the fish was overcooked and didnt look to be fresh at all. Seafood is a big business in Singapore so they have very strong competition and should raise their standards as they have very good locations and looks

This review is for the five times we've eaten at fish&co at paragon mall this year. Firstly. The service is excellent for Singapore or Asia standards. Very welcoming. Polite to ask guests in queue if smaller groups can come in before them as small tables are available. Excellent touch. A Snr persons comes by to check during the meal if all is okay still, even at busy peak Time. The staff come often to clear away dishes from the table.Menu has huge variety so everyone has an option. Their grilled style fish is delicious. Very fresh cooked feel. Soft and succulent. Never overdone. Never raw. Just perfect every time. the Grilled calamari is the best. Their mash is soft with tasty cream. Rice side dish is yummy too. Always some promotion or special in place. Price is fair for prime location in orchard, for lovely ambience and style of eating in the frying pans. Food comes in sequence of drinks, then starters, then mains. Can be quick sequence but its a busy fast restaurant so best be prepared to enjoy your food when it's done. Overall all five visits this year has been great. Will come back again as they are reliable and it's amazing to see such well trained staff. Well done fish&co for turning around this place so masterfully.

we had fish & chips there,
the fish was great, but a little to big for me, but is was very nice.
the fish was served in a pan, which made it different from a plate!
overall very nice.

All good and tasty. Good place to dine while relaxing your feet after shopping at PAragon and ORchard Road

Compare to Jakarta fish & co, the menu is not very different, from salad, soup, pizza, assorted fish & chip, is available, nice place to eat, and near to my hotel at Mandarin Orchard. Must visit in Singapore.

It was good to be able to have a decent fish & chip meal. The 'London fish & chips' was most enjoyable. The piece of fish was enormous. It was very trendily dished up in a frypan, very novel! The 2nd visit I found the 'Best fish & chips ' to be a little greasy, but generally both quantity & quality very good

We dropped in here for lunch last week and ordered 1 drink, 1 starter and 2 mains. The drink arrived fairly quickly along with one of the mains. we waited patiently for the appetizer (soup) and the other mains but it didnt arrive until very late and after several reminders. The soup was cold and unappetising. The second main arrived much later once my husband had already finished his main. Of course this may have been a one-off but we were disappointed as the meu is high priced unlike the local restaurants and we expected better service. The staff however were quite courteous and friendly but the food itself didnt match our expectations
4
Went their twice during my stay in town.Very good choice of meals but the place is definetly specialised in fish and chips. Because it is a very basic meal the quality of ingridiencies makes the differenceThe quality which was used for my meals were excellentWould retur

After London, the world's best fish & chips are served here. The batter is perfect every time and so is the fish. I have eaten at this restaurant several times and have come back for more only because the taste and quality are perfect time after time

Arriving fairly late in the evening on a delayed flight, Fish & Co was literally the only place still serving meals so we are there. But we definitely weren't disappointed - excellent meal with excellent older waiter called Abel who was extremely friendly & who helped make suitable recommendations. The choice in the menu is immense & Fish & Co was really busy that night......there is also a good choice of cold drinks & "mocktails"......I opted for a Lychee Mojito & I absolutely loved it - fresh tasting & wonderful combination of mint & lychee......The following day when we met up with local Singapore friends they told us that we made a grat choice as Fish & Co is also their favourite fish restaurant in the Orchard Road area & they are real "foodies"......I can really re comment Fish & Co.....

I ate here 3 times last year and realized how bad things were. So for 1year I stopped visiting. On the spur I decided to give Fish & Co paragon another visit. To my surprise every part of the experience was excellent. I rated 5 for everything. The food was tasty and satisfying with the food cooked perfectly this time. The calamari was good. The salmon. The prawns. The barramundi. All was lovely. Service was superb. Short on staff but excellently managed and served. I felt quite appreciated for being a customer there. I will definitely visit soon for my seafood.

For my last visit I stuck to the original fish and chips (for reasons I will describe below)The fish was a decent size, batter was fried to a crispy golden with the fish still moist and succulent ... EXCELLENT ... apart from the OIL SLICK on the pan, not an appetizing sight !I prefer the starchy thick English square cut chips,but what I was served was akin to french fries.Some years ago, we visited various Fish & Co outlets.Mostly the batter was over fried, with oil that needed changing hours ago.There were always oil slicks on the pan, we used to joke that was a trademark of Fish & Co.We were a big group sharing seafood platters, we would laugh at the dripping oil.One day some 2 years ago, we re-visited the Fish & Co@Paragon. Two of us ordered the skate. Both pieces were SO OVER-COOKED there was less than 5% edible fish !! The staff refused to replace the dishes.That was over 2 years ago, we had not stepped into another Fish&Co.Strangely, I broke that boycott early this year.Although I had enjoyed that meal, I felt guilty breaking that boycott.It was a feeling of "unresolved justice" and that we should continue shunning Fish&Co for making diners pay for inedible fish
