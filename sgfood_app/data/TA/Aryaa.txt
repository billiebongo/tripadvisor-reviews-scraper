Me and my wife had a butter chicken and lamb kebab for our dinner, and it was really good. Both were nicely seasoned. The ambience was awesome, and the staffs were very friendly.
5
We tried meze platter, dum biryani with lamb, sheek kebap and galaktoboureko as dessert. All were delicious but biryani and dessert were really fantastic.
5
I first time came here with my family based on a friend recommendation and found really excellent Indian and Greek food. Very good service .
4
The food was good. The atmosphere was better. They could be a bit more generous with the quantity. Quality was up there üëç

Paid a visit this week for dinner. Had Veg Biryani and Murgh Shekhawati. Chef Kamal is very good in his skills, along with his personal touch to come over to each table for feedback. The mocktails were great as well

Our experience dining at aryaa was one of a kind serving two different cuisines greek and indian was a perfect match for us. I Tried butter chicken with butter naan was simply amazing. My friends ordered non vegs mix platter from the indian menu and aryaa's grill platter from the greek side both have different taste but all was delicious. Highly recommend this place

The place looks and sounds expensive..BUT to be honest once your inside you will feel very cozy and my impression for this place changed the moment i was seated by a friendly and handsome staff..I ordered Chicken Souvlaki and it was so delicious..for the dessert, hmm i fell in love with the Galaktoboureko, which was recommended by the "cute" chef.. they have a seperate cocktail bar that offers all kinds of drinks...isnt it amazing!Love the place, love the food.. Very good service !Keep up the good work and thank you Aryaa!! I had a lovely dining experience

Came here for lunch. Ordered the $10 curry and naan. The food was fine. However the naan came in a used basket which had the greasy remains of something else in it (see photos). They just chucked a piece of grease proof paper on top of the previous food and then put my naan on top. It was pretty gross.
3
We popped in on a Monday night..the place was empty.Food was very excellent..we had Butter Chicken and Laal Maas. Generous serves of rice and garlic naan. One problem is they only offer Happy Hour deals on beer; why not house pour wine too? And that wine was very average. Overall a very limited and expensive wine list, by glass or bottle.A question for your Marketing Team perhaps? We have walked past many times and been put off by the dreary appearance and lack of people. And inside is soulless; especially when empty so we sat outside. Definitely needs a refurbishment.

Kamal amazing Chef!!! If you want a total foodie Experience try Aryaa. Delicious dishes and amazing service and attention to detail! Super treat awaits your experience.
5
Excellent food and customer service. Definitely a place to recommend for authentic Mediterranean food
2
I often shy away from restaurants that present themselves as specialist in two very distinct foods. I should have followed my better instincts, specially as the only guests in the place on a Saturday evening. Aryaa's interpretation of Mediterranean gyros is truly unique to itself and definitely not worth writing home about. The butter chicken, a staple of any good Indian venue, would have turned me off to the dish entirely had I not had so much better elsewhere. When it came time to leave, no one wanted the leftovers. It was expensive and did nothing to make me feel like there was value in what they delivered. We won't be back to its dank, dark confines.
5
I couldn't stop my self by sending you a thank you for amazing food and good service . My kids loved it , out of our 5 days stay in singapore we landing coming to your resturant twice for meals. Good value for money and really tasty food . Loved the biryani and kebabs . Best Indian food I have had outside India !

I have found this place looking for the best falafel in Singapore and so far their falafel is indeed the best. Also ordered fish and lamb. Quite delicious. Complements to the cook.
5
Had dinner with my family here. We tried mainly Greek cuisine, and it was really good. They've also got their own custom creations like Cheese Tikka bread and chicken tikka pizza, the former which we tried and was great. Service was really good, and the servers were very friendly. The chef even came out to greet us
1
I happened to walk by when I noticed the sign for a $10 lunch. Imagine my surprise when my total bill came up to $14.12. Why? Because even though the sign says butter chicken is $10 the small print on the menu said it was $12. Then there was a service charge (for serving me lunch?!) and GST. When I asked the server about the pricing discrepancy he told me I should call the manager and he would give me his phone number if I wanted it. Seriously?!The food was okay. Not bad but not outstanding either. I was the sole lunch time weekday diner at 12:30 if that's any indicator of popularity. Maybe because they cheat on their pricing? (BTW I would've been fine with a $12 lunch. My only objection is the false advertising and unwillingness to do anything about it.)

This place is just next to Plaza Apartments and I have been to this area so many times but just recently found about this place. I went for dinner with my girl friends, ambiance was pretty nice and cozy (it's not grand as it showed in their website).We ordered Aryaa Meze platter, it was super yum. Moussaka (Vegetarian) was very nice. My friends order Aryaa's grill platter and they are satisfied with food taste and quality.Service was bit slow, our cocktails took way too long to serve. Overall it was pleasant experience

We went to Aryaa today for family lunch.The first impression was amazing. A lot of effort has gone in, in detailing.Ambience & setup: The wall work and ambience is impressive, rustic finish with elegant touch. Table tops are impressive. Loved the canopy style seating. It is a fusion of a lot of different styles. Nice bar counter! It also has seatings outside which I suppose might be great in the evenings!Cutlery: The plates are printed with restaurant logo. Cutlery was particularly impressive and it is what a good restaurant 'fine dining' should have.Service: When we went in the afternoon, it wasnt crowded. There was only one server looking for the entire restaurant, despite that service was good.Pricing: Medium, fairly priced for a fine dining restaurant.Menu: It is stretched but not elaborate. It has variety of cuisines but with in that, it offers limited options. Example in North Indian Veg A la carte - there is only Kadhai Paneer option in Paneer gravy. Desserts are limited, it helps in ordering because you dont have too many options, but I suppose more the better! Suggestion: Gulab Jamun and Rasgulla are boring desserts! Offer some unique stuff!Presentation: It was good. Complimented the cutlery. I loved the Kulfi bowl!Taste: What matters above all, taste, it wasnt upto the mark, honestly. I wanted to like it but there were no differential flavours. Panner was fresh, gravy had everything it should have, yet no distinct flavour in it. Daal tadka missed 'tadka' in it. Butter Tandoori roti wasn't how it is suppose to be. Broccoli soup was good, texture- flavour- taste - all good! Everything had everything yet no dish stood out. I wont crave for the taste of any dish i had here!Overall feel: It is nice place except for the taste. May be, I will visit one more time to have another go with a fresh perspective! No complains really but taste lasts for a long time, more than the feel of the place!Panee

First thing I noticed was the great atmosphere, well decorated and tables far enough apart not to be sitting on top of other patrons like you have to at many restaurants.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Food was excellent, well presented and excellent flavours. Only complaint was I ate too much!!Will be bac

We had dinner at Aryaa as it is right opposite the apartment we are staying at. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We were offered water at the table which is very unusual, we were most impressed. The meal we ordered came quite quickly and was absolutely delicious. Would visit this restaurant again should we get the chance.
5
Attended the Pakistani Food Festival at this great place and enjoyed every bit of the experience. Once we went for lunch and two days later for a dinner. Both meals were good, authentic and tasty. The outside sitting area is quite nice and all the hosts were friendly and courteous
1
Got scammed by one of their salesman promoting the restaurant at Orchard Road. Got swindled into paying $20 for a piece of paper card that promises one for one deals, only to realise there a many restrictions that come with this deal. Food is not fantastic either. Not sure how they qualify as "fine dining". Do not patronise such a restaurant. Shady
3
We got to the restaurant late almost 9 pm on a Saturday evening. Place was empty except for 2 tables. Yet the manager refused to let us have our table of choice claiming it was reserved. We finished and left the restaurant about 10.30pm and we didn't see any diners showed up for the "reserved" table. Also hard to get service as staff were hanging near the bar talking most of the time. If you don't mind being told where you can sit and having to catch the staff's attention for every single thing, the food is good
4
Took some business colleagues to dinner on New Years eve and as usual , all thoroughly enjoyed the Greek and Indian food they ordered. Always eat here whenever I am in Singapore for business and have not been disappointed. Only down side is a limited selection of bottled wines
2
We dropped in here for a drink on our way back to our hotel. The staff were friendly and attentive and the cocktails were wonderful however when we came to pay (2x$24 and 2x $20) it was all of a sudden $103!!!! When we questioned the price we were told service charge and government tax were added. When we questioned again it all of a sudden dropped to $93! Not impressed - still $5 over the advertised price! We were going to come back for dinner but don't think we will bother after all

I'm so happy we chose to dine here after I put in quite a bit of time and effort to find a suitable restaurant for the final night of our 5 week holiday. I wanted somewhere within walking distance of our hotel (Village Hotel Bugis) that could cater for my husband who loves his meat but also for myself as I am vegetarian and coeliac. We both love Greek and Indian cuisine and we absolutely LOVED this place. We were welcomed at the door by our friendly waiter, shown to our table set amidst stunning middle Eastern decor. We were seated near a large group but we had a little area off to the side that was private and quiet.It was difficult to choose from such a diverse menu but we decided to go Greek with a vegetarian moussaka for me and lamb gyros with pita, fries and tzatiki for Mr. The waiter didn't bat an eye when I asked him to check if my dish was gluten free which was refreshing as we'd been travelling through areas where little English was spoken. I can honestly say after 5 weeks of eating nothing but Thai food the moussaka was sublime with the best bechamel sauce I've ever had. Mr cleared his plate in no time and absolutely loved his meal too. We will remember this superb meal for a long time to come. To top it off our lovely waiter offered us a 20% discount for staying at our nearby hotel.Next time we are in Singapore we will be back twice - once for Indian and again for Greek

We came here for dinner on a Saturday. The establishment is nicely decorated nicely with a big spartan helmet at the end of the isle and cabana style seats at the corners. The place was easy to find along beach road next to Parkroyal Hotel and Pan Pacific Suites. If driving along beach road toward the city, turn left right after Parkroyal. There is ample parking available at Pan Pacific Suites parking lot.Service staff were friendly and prompt. The menue comes in two parts - indian and greek. Its an interesting combination and good for those who want to mix and match between the two fares. We went for all greek as we have not had greek in awhile. We had Meze platter which comes with a mix of Meze and dips. We had to order more bread as the hungry kids wiped out all the bread. We also ordered the mix grill plata; Mousaka. For dessert, we had both the desserts on the menue. The Baklava was good. All what we ordered were good. They also serve Asahi on tap - both black and white. Overall, we liked the service; the ambience and the food was to our liking. We will be back again

Ordered the plated gyro for dinner through UberEats. It was delivered to me within 30mins so issue was not with Uber. Extremely disappointed. 1) the chicken gyro wasn't Greek but Indian...even though I ordered from the Greek menu. 2) pita bread was stale and very hard. 3) the chicken tasted a bit spoiled. I wonder if this was made for lunch and sat around in the SG heat all dayI tried this place because of all the positive reviews but it was shockingly bad. I wouldn't eat anything from here again even if they tried to pay me.
5
Although the reviews for this restaurant were for the ala carte items, we went for the set lunch. Ordered the Greek, Bulgarian and Israeli mains. Though we may not know what the origin taste of these food were, but every dish were very tasty
5
One of the best Indian Greek good food in town . Had awesome time with yummy food and great service. Dal Makhni was best, Mezza Platter highly recommended
5
This little gem was a 2 minute walk from my hotel so I began to frequent it once I realized how excellent the service and food were. By the end of my trip, I felt like I knew everyone there. They exhibited the same professionalism and service no matter who was behind the bar or waiting tables. Sudesh and Yan Fat were especially welcoming and engaged every time I visited.On top of the service, the food was excellent. I had a few different dishes and I'd honestly recommend any of them
4
We decided to have a meal at Aryaa after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor as we were looking for a multi-cuisine restaurant around the CBD.We ordered the Aryaa Meze platter which includes different dips and it was delicious - highly recommended. For main course, we had Vegetable Moussaka and Rosemary Grilled Lamb Brizola. Both were very good. The service is EXCELLENT. The staff is very friendly and warm, specially the bartender (Sorry, couldn't get his name) and Sudesh, who took our order. We will give the restaurant 4 stars just because of the service
5
What a pleasant surprise. The best Indian food we have EVER had, including in India. Compliments to the chef, the staff and the owner. Highly recommend

We were trying to find a nice place for our last night in Singapore. We found this place in tripadvisor and thought to give it a shot. As they had some kind of party inside so that they sat us outside, which turned out to be a mistake. It was very noisy, people walked through the table disturbing us during dinner and our waiter seemed to be having his first day. He was trying, but still, he wasn't very attentive nor did he bring us ice after asking for it many times.The food was quite good tho. If you do eat her, have the chicken souvlaki. I prob wouldn't return here as location and service wasn't good.
3
I'd read a lot about this new restaurant and decided to try it out with the family.It is located in the Diners building on level 1 and there is plenty of parking in the attached car park.The decor was more 'Club' rather than restaurant.We ordered a Chicken Gyro to start off with followed by a Murg Shekhawat along with some Naans.The Chicken Gyro was ok but the meat had probably been sitting for a while. The Murg Shekhawat was very mediocre and didn't really satisfy.The naans were a shocker. They were immensely salty.Our server was confused by the portions that make up a single naan but other than that the service was average.I would not go here again
5
Great service and wonderful food.A plesant surprize. We were just looking for some place different for lunch and hit the jackpot. Food was served fast, hot and much better than expected ( best resturant in this entire area, beach road) anyone in this vicinity should definately check it out and we will be back frequently. Thanks to all who served us especially Suren
5
We stopped by Aryaa for a quick lunch and were very pleasantly surprised. Good service. Interesting mix of Greek and Indian food. Every dish was delicious and the lunch menu was exceedingly good value. It is rare in Singapore to be surprised not just with good food but genuine service and good value. Kudos
4
I was looking for a good Greek restaurant which traditionally have been hard to find in Singapore so was scanning Tripadvisor 10 Best Greek Restaurants in Singapore and was struck by the number of excellent reviews this restaurant has. A little bit put off that their web portrays it as Greek and North Indian I still felt it had to be tried. What a pleasant surprise, we had Greek food and Greek wine which were both excelent. The service also. Decoy is Indian and very nice although I missed the traditional Greek white and blue of the Meditteranean
4
Had a wonderful time... loved the food.. definitely a place to hang out and have fun with friends. Great drink promotions. Friendly staff that made my birthday exceptional
3
Space was abundant in the place. Place looks very exotic. Good lighting and music. Experienced slight miscommunication with the staff. However they rectified it quite quickly. Waiters were new I suppose as they didn't know what dishes they were serving. Food was amazing! Especially their mixed grill! The meat were grilled to perfection. Overall we had a good evening :
5
If you're looking for a place to dine and chill with your crew, this is the place to taste awesome Greek and Indian dishes. Aryaa turns into a club too on Friday and Saturday nights where they play excellent hip hop, rnb and bollywood mixes.
5
Had a fantastic meal over at Aryaa. Enjoyed their lunch special, Butter Chicken with Naan. Will go again to try their Greek menu. Revisit worthy.
5
The food is great and very tasty - it is all filled with Flavours and the food is brought out very fast and the service is great!
5
Love their greeks food, lamp are the best. They are so dedicated of their food presentations and the interior in Aryaa is amazingly romantic, they have live music too. I think is best for couples who have a fine dining here. And they are more than just a restaurants. Also a lounge bar and dancing club at night. Recommended.
5
I visited Aryaa with a few friends to try out their Greek/Indian food. I had a few dishes but my favourite has to be the vegetarian Hara Bhara Kabab - spinach, peas, and potatoes. It was tasty and delicious, complimented well with chutney sauce
5
I went with a couple of friends and we had the alexander platter. The portion was good and the spread is amazing! I loved the falafel! All the different dishes tasted so unique. I would go back again
5
Brought a couple of friends down over the weekend and really enjoyed our night, great food and service, authentic Greek and Indian cuisine.Definitely do check this place out if you're in town, what really works for me is that it opens till late and it located in the central area. Keep up the good work guy
5
Was invited for a business lunch to Aryaa, and very much enjoyed the original Greek food offered. I chose the tsatsiki appetizer and the lamb moussaka as an entree. Both dishes did not disappoint offering truly original Greek tastes, beautiful plating and generous portion sizes. My colleagues had the set lunch and chose Indian food (the other cuisine on offer at Aaqua). They also liked the quality and freshness of the food as well as the tastes (very spicy, though). The service was super attentive, friendly and professional. All in all a great lunch and/or dinner option with respect to food quality, value and service level offered. The ambience was also quite cosy, and if you do like Greek food you simply must try Aarya. Highly recommended!
5
The freshness of the meze platter alone is enough to win over the most skeptical of critics. The service is warm and ambience charming but the clear winner is the food, masterchef Erkan whips up the most delightful lamb mousakka (a greek lasagne type dish) ive ever had. The place is great too for functions whether family or business its got a large seating capacity and the cocktail selection is pretty decent there's a one for one from 5-10pm daily right now my favorite is the Miletus made with house made ginger beer
5
It is a great place to gather and catch up. Great seating area and the place was not too noisy. We found the food quite affordable when shared and it was so tasty. We felt like kings in the area. They have good staff too! The Lamb Moussaka is wonderful
5
Located in a central location, this place is easily accessible to all. The food was amazing and service was great. With a one-of-a-kind menu, I would definitely come back to get a taste of everything.
5
My boss was impressed with this place! He is Greek and he says the food was pretty authentic. I have never had Greek food but I kind of like it.
5
Came here last week with my family and really enjoyed a perfect spread of Greek and north Indian cuisine. The Garides Saganaki and Tagine were my favourites. This is indeed a great restaurant for family dinners.
5
Came across this place the other day. Had dinner there with a couple of mates. Totally enjoyed the ambience of the interior. Very cosy setting and I have to say the chicken soup was amazing! Will definitely pop by again!
4
Went in with my colleagues and absolutely loved the ambiance. Their staff were very accommodating and The chicken souvlaki dish was absolutely to die for!!
5
I called to reserve a table and was late! But they called and made sure if I was coming and held the table for me! The staff was polite and considerate.The waiters were friendly and the food was good! Especially the dessert! I think it's called the Galaktoboureko. Funny nice isn't it? Anyway, that's a really nice pastry with custard

My husband and I went to Aryaa for dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant is on the other side of the charming Haji lane area. we were initially very skeptical when we saw the menu has a mixture of two cuisines and when we walked in, there were only 2 tables taken. The decor looks too much like a tourist trap on Clark Quay so my husband almost walked out. But because of the good review, we decided to give it a try. Really glad we did. The restaurant opened a few months ago, still relatively new. Chef Erkan came out and gave us some recommendations and we ordered exactly what he recommended - Greek mezze platter, meatball on rice in a tangine (can't remember the name though), and the lamb skewer. Everything was so fresh and perfectly seasoned. Portions are very generous especially for Singapore. There are 4 types of mezze and we loved all of them, especially the cheese bite and the creamy yet light cheese dips. We were almost full (we are not big eaters) after the platter when the meatball tangine came out - very juicy and so tasty - you have to try this dish (strangely it doesn't have the recommended chef hat label with it). The lamb skewers were also perfected grilled and the meat was very tender. The feta cheese came on the side with the lamb skewer was so fresh and creamy - not at all like the ones I bought from the super market here even though I paid a lot for them at Cold Storage. We had to really stuff ourselves to not to have too much left over. Total bill was about 85 dollars (we didn't have any alcohol) - very good value for money in SG.
5
We were staying down the road from here and found it by doing a search of nearby restaurants.We went for the $15 lunch special which was either a Mediterranean menu or Indian (meat thali or veg thali.). The beers were also two for the price of one. The food we had was excellent - didn't try the Mediterranean but both the Indians were really tasty and also included on the tray was dessert. Would definitely come back again
4
Confession: I am a really fussy eater given that i eat out daily and have dined at most places in Singapore. I had lunch at Aryaa a month ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the meal we had. We ordered the following: Starters: The Aryaa Meze Platter. My favourite were 2 dips the Tzatziki which was cucumber and yoghurt that was just right and Tirokafteri which was cheese that just melts in your mouth.Main: We went with the Lamb Tagine and the meat was just so tender that i did not feel heavy after. I loved that it came with potato mash which was just right.Dessert: We were suggested to try the Galaktoboureko and i love that it was sweet but not too sweet. The custard was real creamy and i liked the touch of syrup to it. I'd definitely suggest this as the place to go to for Greek food in Singapore
5
Really enjoyed our dining experience at this place which was next door to our hotel. The staff were attentive and the decor is lovely, has a sort of Arabian feel to it. We ordered the lamb kebabs and the tangine meatballs, both were delicious. The cocktails were also good. I recommend this place.
