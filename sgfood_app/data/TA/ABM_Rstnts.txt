we tried the ABM for lunch this time though we were strictly veg . we had a good choice of VEG dishes and the taste was extremely good and so was the service . a nice place altogether .reasonable cost too

For someone like me who eats bland food, could not really get something to eat since most dishes are hot and spicy but well that suits the local people. Tea was great.

This place although sometimes busy provides quick simple cheap ans quick Indian food close to Mustafa centre.
Food suits sensitive pallets and although this wouldn't place be of 5* quality or its surroundings it doesn't advertise itself to be either.
Always enjoyable!!!

I love Indian Foods, but i'm not a vegetarian. So i search around the Farrer Park area to find the best and nearest Indian Restaurant, and Tadaaa! find this one :) at first i'm not sure about the food quality, cz i thought it could be the same tastes with other Indian Restaurants. But then, the first time i ordered Masala Dosai, and gosh ! i can't help that i feel pleased, full, and happy enough ! This restaurant also gives us choice of foods, and my favourites are Masala Dosai, Naan, Coin Paratha, and Chicken Tandoori. They cooked it well, tasty, and not too spicy, it will fit your tongue if you don't really like Indian spices. The access to this restaurant is sooo easy, it located beside the Famous 24 hours Mustafa Center ! you can enjoy it before and after shopping in Mustafa. Have a good lunch in ABM

Did not know about ABM restaurant and stumbled upon it while window shopping. Was not expecting anything out of the ordinary and were unsure what to order, A member of staff recommended Briyani and for the kid, Paper Dosai.Ordered 5 dishes and lassi-drinks. We loved the gravy and curry, which had the right blend of spices and level of spiciness ! My 6 year old kid could not get enough of the briyani rice and curry. He insisted that we return for more, soon.Resonable prices. Air-conditioned and good to the last grain of rice and drop of curry

It was a nice place to refresh after a really tiring shopping experience at the Mustafa Centre and before getting a cab at a taxi stop just around the corner. The naan came freshly baked and the food was inexpensive. It's a self-serviced restaurant. The lassi was thick and yummy

Located besides Mustafa center, Abm restaurant has a quiet good indian food in a singapore reasonable price.I ate the chicken dosa which was very good.The service however, don't expect for a nice welcome smile.There is no beer if you like one, and not a chance to bring from the outside either.It's ok for a lunch, but i would've checked for a better place if i had time

This is one of the usual places my mom and I go for breakfast. The place is clean. The food is yummy. Our regular order...Idli & Vadai meal and plain toseh. Drink will be teh tarik, shared. Ample carpark especially if you get here around 8 am. ABM opens at 8.30am. Next to Mustaffa Centre...a place you can get almost ANYTHING!

We have been to the branch beside mustafa. The vegetarian curries are smelling spoilt, which means that they might be before day cooked ones. The non veg items were avg. And you can certainly find better tasting ones around. Definitely not a place to recommend or visit again

We were craving for Murtabak one evening and went to this restaurant. We ordered Mutton murtabak for sharing between ourselves and Masala tea to go alongwith.The mutton murtabak had very little quantity of meat stuffing and was very dry and hard. We were quite disappointed with the food . Even the masala tea was very light and too sweet. I had been to this restaurant a few years ago and last time there food quality was much better. Somehow this time around we were left very disappointed and would definitely avoid this restaurant in future
