Quite reasonable ramen in Bugis Junction. For $18.90 for one set menu, you will get one ramen, one side dish and one free drink.

Had dinner here while staying at the Intercontinental next door. Service was pretty quick. Portion of the noodle were just fine. But the food quality was average. I am sure there were much better Ramens available around the mall (2nd and 3rd floor).

Not particularly impressed after trying one of their recommended ramens with Japanese pork Cha Siew. Broth is ok but not as flavorsome and fully bodied as to my liking. Ippudo Ramen still takes the cake!

I liked the automated ordering with iPad and the quick service
I did not like the quality of food with seafood cold and the atmosphere very sad

Quick lunch here while staying at the Intercontinental next door. Fantastic food! Would have been happy to come again and again, but only stayed one night - next time!

We were starving so we ordered ajisen ramen, and a set of 10 gyozas + 2 pieces of fried chicken+ rice and miso soup. You have to order on a tablet, that's funny. Food is served very quickly. Gyoza and chicken were excellents. Ramens were just ok. Not the awesome taste I expected but still eatable.

Whilst the service is pretty quick the standard of the food differs. I ordered the vegetable ramen set (at S$13.90) which was fairly tasty and left you feeling pretty full. Within the lunch set you also got a side and drink, I wouldn't recommend going for the fish tempura as they were very bony and large and I didn't bother trying to eat them in the end.My husband on the other hand didn't enjoy his meal at all, mainly due to the undercooked chicken in the fry set (at S$15.90). Luckily there were some gyoza and prawn tempura in the meal to keep him happy! My advice would be to stick to the ramen bowls and avoid the fry sets

Each table has a tablet that is used to handle the ordering process. I liked it a lot and even more so when the dishes arrived quickly after the order release. Food was good and authentic. We had a variety of starters and Salmon teriyaki all tasty. Prices were adequate

A good spot to get a nice quick lunch or dinner in Bugis. This is my go to place for veg ramen noodle soup, and getting exactly what expect each and every time. Hi tech ordering system in their bolted down iPads at each table. Food arrives in 5-10 mins tops. Prices reasonable. Service is fine but disengaged. Set menu available

I have tried this franchise in Brisbane and Sydney, Australia. This one located in Singapore is the best out of the 3. The food is located on a menu and an ipad provided, which you can enter orders in yourself. The service is prompt and quick. You will be provided a confirmation of your order and then within 10mins it will be hot and steaming on your table. Delicious
