Fresh toast, delicious drinks. But as a set you will get happy combo. Not too sweet, it’s just tasty as I don’t eat too sweet. I also got eeg tarts takeaway and will check it out.

Good for early birds, and REAL birds as well. Overall, a good experience except for one order that came late (as in everybody else was done eating.)

Food is tasty, simple and hits the spot. Staff are friendly and efficient. Location is easy to find.

When in Singapore I have to start my day with Kaya Toast and Coffee. Many Toast Boxes in the city, but this is a personal favourite as your sat outside with your morning brew.
4
It was well known for its kaya toast, a traditional breakfast of Singapore. Location was good, right in Bugis Junction and Bugis MRT. The toast was good, though it was not as extremely excellent as expected. Price might be a bit expensive but still affordable.

Toast box is found in many mrt station or shopping mall. Ideal for kaya toast, coffee, tea, etc...people love to just hang out and chit chat. Simple place.

Lots of branches of these around and very busy exotically with locals. It’s self service and they do breakfast and lunch. It’s cheap and cheerful , peanut butter toast and boiled eggs or if you prefer noodles. No choices for tea just one type and their coffee is made there in an unusual way. Cheap, cheerful and quick.

I was staying at the Mercure Bugis and did not not want to pay the $30 SGD upcharge just to have breakfast included in the room rate. I did some research and this place was less than a 5 minute walk and seemed like it would be a good experience for a local breakfast place. I was not wrong. I had read about the Kaya Toast and it really is worth getting. You get two soft (and I mean soft) bolied eggs plus a couple of pieces of toast with coconut jam. It was a taste sensation. Also the coffee is also really good. Just make sure to let them know you don't want want sugar as by default it comes with sugar, I also had the toast with ham, egg and cheese on top which was also good

Always the ever reliable Toast Box. If you want a good snack, they have it. If you want a good meal they have it.Their curry chicken thou, they have probably adjusted the taste. It does not taste as good as before. Their Laksa is also good.Coffee is always good

I had no idea what Kaya toast is until I tried the Kaya breakfast set (S$5.80) at Toast Box. It was simply delicious! The set came with two half toasts, two eggs, and a cup of coffee! I enjoyed everything and finished the food within minutes! The Kaya toast is like toast with Kaya spread and butter. Kaya spread is a mixture of coconut and honey. It was so good that I even bought a bottle to take back home for Family! Highly recommend for breakfast when you are in town!

I'm a big fan of the coffee and kaya toast for a quick snack. It's reasonably priced and the service is adequate.
3
It's always nice to have your usual local fare, and the joy of eating at this cafe is no different. Except that the seating space is cramped. It destroys the joy of eating and having a good time.
4
Order cheese & ham toast set at SGD 6.30. The toast is lip smacking with the combination of ham, grilled cheese and egg!
4
Food quality remains pretty good, but prices are not the most economical. Restaurant is comfortable though, but usually crowded, exorbitant during meal times. Still, a very good representation of a local breakfast tradition.

Good food and good coffee. Also offers selection of hot food. Nice ambiance, clean and refreshing. This branch also has a small in the hallway area of the mall as an extension.

I LOVE kaya toast and kopi C for breakfast in Singapore (the C stands for Carnation Milk). It's light enough that your appetite is recovered for more delicious local food at lunch, but enough to keep you going until then. And it's great value! I bought a Toast Box thermos as a souvenir, and you can also buy jars of kaya or laksa paste, which make great gifts. Singaporeans love Toast Box and toast restaurants in general, so you'll probably need to queue for a short time if you're there for breakfast, which is outside at this outlet. But once you're in, it's cool

There are tons of Toast Box outlets in Singapore. After lunch, we popped in for our caffeine fixes (except that one of us had tea with the works i.e. condensed milk plus evaporated milk and. I learnt that if you want a very thick (no water added) black coffee without sugar, the term is "kopi KILO kosong). We also had their LAVA (sweet salted egg yolk) toast and a kaya (egg jam) toast. The teas and coffees, (regardless of milk/no milk, sugar/no sugar) were S$1.80 each and the Lava TT set was $4.80. Kaya toast on its own was $1.60 and the large barley drink, $2.30.Perhaps because of the complexity of the order (?), we were over-charged for an additional drink (because the lava set should have come with a drink).I may be biased, but I still believe that Yakun Toast (on which Toast Box is patterned) do better coffees, teas and toast

To be honest, Toast box is perfect for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have all kinds of food from sandwhiches to rice dishes. My cousin and I ordered a Noodle and Nasi dish plus their amazing teh iced. Well, that teh iced is their version of milk tea. Very addicting, delicious, and refreshing. I admit, after coming back from Singapore, I've been craving for it.
5
You really have to try their Golden Lava French toast which has salted egg yolk as one of the ingredient used!Mind blowingly yummy and oozing with the golden lava of the special filing they made.Located at a corner of the building facing the main road, it's easy to spot or just ask around from the locals for direction. The milk coffee was good too!

Actually Bugis Junction is quite busy. I saw many singaporean having activities there. Well, just visited for short time to get breakfast and enjoy the athmosphere there. The staff served the customers very fast and the food and coffee were good. Gathering together with Singaporean and fully enjoyable there. Nice place to relax in the morning

A good breakfast spot on the go--the coconut toast was light and perfect with coffee. I also tried the laksa noodles here for lunch since they are one of the traditional local dishes. The noodles were very short and squirmy, but I enjoyed them.
5
Work is best done if breakfast is as tasty and as delicious with Toast Box....the best coffee or tea....eggs and toast is just perfect.....

This TOASTBOX restaurant is part of a well known restaurant chain in Singapore. They serve great toasts and coffee, but also many other small and delicious local dishes like LAKSA.

We actually ate at the shop in the Kitchener complex near Lavender MRT, twice once for breakfast and once for dinner, both were great meals and good value. I personally also loved their coffee. There was always a line up which we took as a good sign which proved to be the case but this was also due to their being only one person serving and if they had to make coffee or tea then they would make it not someone else so that held things up a bit so I am not sure if that is normal or not? Worth the short wait thoug

I ate lunch with a friend in Bugis earlier this week and we decided to have a tea at Toast Box before heading back to the office. A short queue and no issues getting a seat at around 1.30pm. Tea was standard and in line with expectations for any of these chain outlets
4
This place became a favourite of my mothers. She would go everyday to pick up something different to try! It was great to see what she'd bring back and they were always delicious, if not a little on the odd side sometimes! I'd recommend it if you have a sweet toot

After explore bugis distric we want to take a rest and get some late night snack. We look at toast box, franchise snack booth. We choose the sweet butter and kaya toast bread and hot milo for drink. We pick the thick bread but, it's not thick enough for us just like common bread. Taste was standart not special, but the place nice for take a rest for a while

Came here in the morning for breakfast on weekend. There is a queue even on weekend which surprise me as this area is not neighbourhood area. What is famous is their coffee, kaya bread and the soft boiled egg. These are common sample food for breakfast in Singapore. Soft boiled egg is rare in other countries and should give a try as their eggs are always consistent. Enjoy

We have been to various outlets & this in our opinion, this is one of the least desirable outlet to be at.The premise is quite small. Service was very slow & many dirty tables were not cleared. Supposed they were shorthanded as don't see "enough" service crew. After a long wait, an elderly lady came to clear our dirty table. Spoke to her & was told she is the only cleaning crew - on a busy Saturday! As the premise was small, additional tables were laid just outside, facing the main road. It was very hot ( no fans )& pretty uncomfortable sitting outside.Coupled with constant traffic noises & secondary smokes from many smokers just few feet away, it was terrible sitting outside.Ddfinitely will not come to this outlet again

After seeing plenty of Toast Box's dotted around Singapore, we decided to give it a go, and we're glad we did. We ordered one toast with peanut butter and one with Kaya jam. They were cooked fast and with friendly staff. Plus the boiled eggs were nice too. Would definitely try another Toast Box on our travels.

Love their coffee and toast. Even i have moved to australia. I am still come to have this toast when i am in singapore. My fav is the kaya toast breakfast set 1.
4
Great food for a good price, nice coffee and eggs. Really liked the selection of asian and european toppings for the toast. My husband and I chose a different one each day we were in Singapore.
3
we eat their best selling hebi ham in soft bun with two soft boiled eggs. the eggs was so nice and mixed the yellow and white put some salt and you sipped it. so nice and energetic food.
4
I really love their coffee and toasts. The atmosphere of the cafés is really fresh and old style at the same time. Sometimes it feels that there's even too many tables but of course it's easier to find a table that way.My recommendation is to buy also delicious Kaya to take away. Variety of the cakes is not that plentiful and the taste is even too sweet for me but those toasts and eggs are really something I miss. For me this is the best cafeteria chain I've met. 
5
Great Breakfast Menu and coffee. Do try the Kaya toast and the Thick Peanut Butter Toast. Obviously try the Nayyang Kopi (coffee), traditional coffee at its best. There is lot on the menu for breakfast, brunch and evening snacks. This is not an outlet for lunch and dinner
5
I tried at least 4 shops along Bugis that serves KAYA toasts...and I guarantee you that TOAST BOX is the best! First of all the location is amazing. It's in the prime corner location. The staffs are wonderful with all BIG SMILES! Food is so yummy that will really make you smile :)...and will definitely complete your day! Will definitely love to visit again this store...very soon

We got bored with the hotel breakfast menu and decided to go here just a 5 minute walk from our hotel.It is opening at 8am and we are the very first customer, ordered a peanut butter set and a butter-sugar toast for our sononly eating half of the toast and we are almost full, the multigrain bread is reall filling our tummy very fast. the coffee is very nice.We sat outside just to enjoy a perfectly quiet saturday morning where there was no rush hour people / traffic

We came for a late lunch at 3pm & the place was pretty empty, just 3 tables occupied in sight yet the service was slow & rude. We dont mind for delays if it were crowded. Worst of all was the foul attitude displayed by the staff who prepared the food. Curry chicken was salty & smelt burnt. The eggs were 3/4 cooked instead of half-boiled. Apparently, the services & food quality are deteriorating by the week. Our last visit was in BreakTalk in HQ at Upper Paya Lebar & we encountered rude staff whom we reckoned sounded like Chinese Nationals. Perhaps, this is an omen that we better, from now on, stop going to patronise this chain unless improvements are visible. Anyway, having experienced 2 to 3 times of rude staff behavior we totally lost our confidence to ever try again to attempt our future visits. Sadly, the management may be unaware of such ugly incidents or they just closed both eyes to such matters. Our kids & ourselves, as parents, have lost faith despite giving chances over & over again

We went there for breakfast they have small but sufficient menu, 2 boiled eggs come with each toast option. Warning they very soft almost raw, I could only stomach one but the peanut butter toast was deliciously salty and crunchy!! Combo comes with coffee or tea too and food is really quick and service super efficient and friendly!!☕

Visited the outlet at MBFC for the usual tea and Kaya toast yesterday morning. This one is located close to the entrance to the Downtown MRT and can get very busy around lunchtime, but at 10am in the morning it was fine: no problems getting served or getting a seat. Tea and toast were standard as per other outlets
