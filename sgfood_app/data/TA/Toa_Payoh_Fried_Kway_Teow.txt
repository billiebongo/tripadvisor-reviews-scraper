Very consistent and good wok-hei.
Portion is generous and service is friendly too.
Worth its cholesterol.

What is Fried Kway Teow, well it is fried rice noodles, yellow noodles, cockles, Chinese sausage, bean sprouts, dark and light soya sauces with other ingredients. The dish is a little oily but is very flavourful and aromatic.Though fried, it is not dry and can be spicy if you like to have it that way. There are other ingredients added but these are probably trade secrets of the owner of the stall.This can be taken for a meal as the portion is sizeable and at SGD 3 a plate it is value for money.Toa Payoh Fried Kway Teow is a hawker stall which is a distance from Toa Payoh MRT station and located at Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, Block 22A Food Centre. You can catch SBS Service 232 from the Bus interchange which is just above Toa Payoh MRT station and stop at Block 23, Toa Payoh East and you are just 5 mins walking distance from the Food Centre. Please ask the bus Captain to inform you when you are at Block 23.Two to three stalls away is a dessert stall where one can also try a hot mung bean dessert served with a small pieces of deep fried rolls which is also recommended to complete your light meal, Bon Appetit
