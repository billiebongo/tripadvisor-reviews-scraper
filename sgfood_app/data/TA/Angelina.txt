I went to the outlet at MBS today.
Coffee machine was down.
2/4 tea selection unavailable
No Mont Blanc and lemon tart though other cakes were available
Service was slow at every step of the way
Food portions small
There are other options at MBS

A French restaurant serving good high tea, pastries and dessert. Great ambience and quiet setting. :)

food is quite good, service too. My first time there, I may come back one day. Their selection of dishes is good.

Went to the branch at marina bay sands for dinner. Only a handful of diners but yet the service was extremely slow. Waited 15 - 20 mins for them to take our orders despite signaling to the waiter a couple of times. They did apologize for being being under manpower but there weren't many diners ! Waiting for food being served is another 20 -30mins and my coffee wasn't even being served and we have to personal walk to the counter many times to request for the sauce which was never delivered. Settling of bill is another pain! One of the waiters whom I believe is the manager simply ignored us a couple of times by doing non important stuff like arranging cups etc at the counter. When the waiter finally acknowledged us , he went to cashier and then walked away leaving us puzzled that instead of punching in the system and preparing the bill, he walked away ... so to summarize , it took another 15 mins to settle the bill! They even billed me for the coffee which was never served! Overall experience was unpleasant and horrible!

There was no one at the entire restaurant when we had dinner. Food wise, nothing fantastic other than the renowned chocolate drink. I was surprise that the restaurant ran out of salmon when I ordered the Singapore salad. Will recommend the restaurant only when you need a nice chocolate drink or a nice tea.
1
Firstly, not recommended at all.Food/dessert selection is very limited. At our visit, there were only 5 desserts to choose from, excluding signature Mont Blanc.Food quality is below standard. The shrimps in the pasta was not fresh with the mushy chalky texture. The portion is small. The bacon seems worse than the one in your school sandwich. Totally disappointed
1
We first came here a few months ago and left feeling hopeful that there is finally a decent French patisserie in Singapore. 5 visits later, we are sad to say the service and the quality of food has just gone rapidly down the hill. The staff was clueless and ignorant, the food was extremely slow to arrive and the quality was just plain horrid. So safe to say we wonâ€™t be coming back for a sixth visit. Not sure how they will survive if this continues but I do wish them luck.
3
Went there for breakfast. The pastries and the scrambled eggs were quite nice. So was the fresh orange juice. The hot chocolate was delicious but very rich. The fruit salad turned out to be from a can topped with some blueberries and a strawberry. The service was nice and prompt. I did not like the atmosphere - either you sit in a dark spot downstairs or upstairs where it all looks scrambled together. Overall value for money regarding breakfast is better elsewhere

It was my 1st visit to Angelina as I am Survival Chic's (SC) Member entitled with 30% discount. When we reached Angelina on 15/10/2017 at 6.30pm as per our reservation, it was quite empty except a couple at the back. We were the only diners after they left and remained so when we left. We flipped through the menu and were disappointed that both the selection of food and pastries were very limited. so we decided to have light dinner by ordering a chicken and fish dishes and it turned out that the fish was acceptable at best, but the chicken was quite bad in taste and flavour. This was not the end of our unhappiness. When we settled the bill, I found that 20% instead of 30% discount was given. I asked the only waiter why this discrepancy and was told that the manager (whom was not at the scene, I noticed the waiter made telephone call to him) said so. I contacted SC's Customer Service the next day and SC confirmed that the correct discount should be 30% for up to 5 pax. I would like to presume that Angelina is not a honorable restaurantas compared to another similar type of restaurant, ANTOINETTE, which we have visited many times and enjoyed the food, pastries and services. For sure, I will never go back to Angelina again
3
Had the vegetable risotto that came out cold - I don't know if it's because it took almost half an hour for the food to come, which in reason is itself indefensible. Portion was small for something that cost $32 after get and service charge but thankfully I wasn't too hungry then. It surprises me that the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu, having to take a look at the menu with every order we gave.
3
Angelina's has changed. Has become less upmarket. Not sure if that's a good thing. But I guess it's still ok.
3
Nice hot Chocolatiers drinks that can share but it's thick and rich and very hard to finish alone and expensive
3
There was much hype on the place when they first opened. We tried the pasta as well as the cakes, both were disappointing. The pasta was average and the cake were too sweet and on the dry side.
3
I must order the truffle fries every time I'm here. One of the best!
The half cooked egg is well seasoned too and extremely moreish.
The pastries taste particularly fresh on this visit. Every bite brings great satisfaction.
5
Environment is good for a lovely dinner for family and couples. Food portion is small but savory to the taste bud. Had a great night of chit chatting with wine paired.
5
It's a cosy place with really good desserts! The staff were polite and attentive. Great service. It's also located near the train station and other local attractions which is a plus point.
3
~last year after a great dinner night out 4 of us went searching for dessert and stumbled on Angelina, but without any prior knowledge of the hype of this place~a very inviting dessert chiller beckoned BUT an unreal effort of the staff in an almost empty dining area pretty much ignored us standing at the front over the menu stand and when entertained at 8pm Thursday decided to let us know they have to check if we can be seated~it was a WoW moment of disbelief but keeping this to a minimum I'd informed the staff that we're here just for desserts and will take any table anywhere before they let us in (maybe it was an hour and half to closing time???)~anyhoo we had 3 items and I remember nothing of note except the treatment and won't be back eve

Ate twice in this restaurant within a week, and had two different experiences.The lunch sets that my friend and I tried offered smart value for money (13.80sgd++ includes a starter, a main and a choice of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Furthermore, the pastries that we enjoyed for dessert is discounted to only 8sgd, instead of 10/13/14sgd, and the montblanc is divine!) Bill was about 53sgd for two persons.The second time I visited was mid-afternoon, wherein two of us ordered the high-tea set and the third person had ravioli. The latter was commendable; however, the former can significantly be improved. Bill was about 108sgd for three persons.As another reviewer had observed, the hot chocolate served in this branch is awful; it is NOT the same as the one served in Rue di Rivoli:
2
I had the chance to try the original Angelina in Paris, and their hot chocolate is the best I have ever drank. However, the one in Singapore tasted different, and I mean it in a bad way.Angelina's hot chocolate is unique because theirs is known to be super thick and filling. I enjoyed the one in Paris because the rich taste of the chocolate was able to penetrate the thickness, which resulted in a complex but an enjoyable drink. But the one in Singapore is just a poor imitation of this speciality. Yes, it was still thick, but the layered taste of chocolate was not there. It was just a plain thick and bitter. As one reviewer has said, it was a torture to finish it. So, it did not only taste different, but horrible as well.What truly disappoints me that the taste should not have been like this. I almost felt cheated. Ideally, the drink should taste the same, no matter who makes it or where it is made. If Angelina in Singapore cannot recreate the same drink, they might as well change its name in their menu.On the other note, the service is great. Their Mont-Blanc tea is nice, has a flowery, calming smell and pleasant taste. But seriously, that hot chocolate is just plain unforgivable
3
Considering the rest of its menu, the $13.90 three course set lunch is really cheap. However, the portions are small, but you do get to taste its signature chocolate drink. Tried four of its pastries, including the signature Monte Blanc. But it's the Opera that stood out. Wish they would serve more of the items from the opening menu. I missed those!
4
Nice place for an afternoon gathering. The dessert was good and their hot chocolate is worth trying!
4
Set Dinner was very good and value for your money especially the smoked salmon salad. The croissant was great as well as the desserts though did not fancy the mont blanc dessert.
3
Pleasant. Had the set lunch. Menu now a bit on the light side. It was not quite enough to fill me. So sad.
5
It has a great ambience and the staffs were really nice! They have an exceptional customer service. Awesome!
3
Tucked away in a quiet spot of the revamped Capitol building, this is a cosy place to rest your feet, enjoy some cakes and good quality tea away from the nearby bustling malls.
4
Friendly staff, good ambience, nice food. Will be better if the brunch is available all day. Desserts are nice too!
3
Food and ambience was so-so, quite disappointed with the hot chocolate which was their signature but the taste turned out a little weird. Overall average experience and overrated.
3
The menu has changed. Main courses have been reduced to five. The steak has also been changed and the price has increased from $36 to $45. The café was quiet on a Saturday night and so it was a good place to chat with friends.
4
The food and the ambience still acceptable. The staff is friendly. I hope get more choices for Valentine's Day set menu
5
It's a must place to visit for a chocolate lover. Too bad I have to fly over to Singapore first for everytime I'm craving of the mont blanc dessert. But I will definitely spare my time to visit this place again when I got the chance to visit singapore. Can't wait to go back!
2
This place is more of a place for tea. Not suitable for dinner as the menu is very small. The pricing is also quite stiff. A vegetarian pasta cost $29 while barramundi cost $32. Food is average at best. They were also understaffed.
5
Excellent service (consider we have a toddler with us). The food was great. Compare to Paris's Angelina, The hot chocolate is a little bit more creamy but still, we had a great experience in Angelina Singapore
4
Atmosphere was very good. Scallop with black rice dish was really very awesomely unique. Signature monc blanc dessert is a tad too sweet though and truffle fries was so so. Tea selection tasted great.
3
Food was good but not wow. Cube roll was a bit over cooked. Seafood dishes were nice and yummy. Service was decent.
5
Strongly recommend their set dinner. Was very impressed by the chestnut blonc cupcake. Portion is just nice, and the overall food taste is delicious.
3
We went for their desserts and tea - was probably expecting much more so was disappointed, especially for the price we paid.
3
Tried for the first time but disappointed. Mains are not worth the price. Understand that cakes are meant to be sweet but the taste of "white sugar" is too strong, tried Mont Blanc, it is bad. Think the chocolate croissant is better. Dine in & spent closed to $180 & packed the half eaten Mont Blanc but was charge $1 for a small box
4
Most diners visit the restaurant for coffee/tea and desserts, but I actually enjoy their main course more. During one of my visit, I ordered their macaroons.. perhaps it was pretty late that the macaroons have been in the dessert counter for too long, the macaroons served to me were so tough that i had difficulty biting it. Unforgettable experience
3
Came here for 1 for 1 with the entertainer app. Mains were good and hearty. Seafood risotto had a bitter aftertaste. Beef stew and sea bass (no snapper that day) was well cooked. Signature mont-blanc was normal and tasted similar to red bean paste. Opera cake was nicer in my opinion because I'm a chocolate lover.
5
 we are here for a late lunch today. we've been to Angelina in Dubai many times. So when we found out that Singapore has one, we decided to dropby. i orderded my usual Wild Mushroom Risotto while the Mrs ordered her usual Pan Seared Red Snapper Fillet. The food here are always at its very high standard wherever or which ever Angelina you go... excellent!!
3
Had another dinner there recently. Angelina's appears to be trying to cater to a different market segment now. Red Snapper has been changed to a cheaper fish. No more complementary bread rolls. On the day I went, only 4 types of macarons.
5
Good food and good service! Great place to spend time with friends and family. Definitely will recommend to my friends.
4
Overall experience was pleasant. Not too crowded maybe cause it was a weekday evening. Food was good, had seafood risotto and opera cake.
4
great set lunch no burn pockets great value for dollars gotta go back again....merci.....ne pas parlez vous francais
4
Everyone should try their Mont Blanc tart!
The chestnut cream is to die for! The overall service was average.
4
Finally I visited. Onion soup was awesome. Should try!
I want to try the croque during my next visit! 💋
4
Had the beef steak and the seafood risotto. the beef was bland and the sauce didn't match at all. risotto was ok but the seafood had no taste. We ordered the opera cake for dessert which was very good. Would go there again for dessert.
3
I went there due to the popularity of the dessert.Environment: Nice for tai tai high tea, chit chat and tea for few hours. Service is goodDesserts: Very pretty and nice looking. Taste good but all very sweet to me, it sounds funny if desserts are not sweet but it is way over and all of us cannot even finish it as once you ate more, you feel bloated.Price: Mid range, to me it is quite expensive to pay $10+ for dessert
3
My friends and I were very excited to check out the highly recommended desserts and hot chocolate here, and since it was lunchtime, and they had just started offering a set lunch menu, we decided to check that out too. The set lunch was incredibly good value, with 3 courses. We tried all the mains, and they were all good! To top it off, you could enjoy your Mini Hot Chocolate as part of the set too! Just nice! I particularly liked the Butterfish. We decided to spoil ourselves with their famous cakes. The newly created Mont Blanc with coconut crisps was overly sweet, and not memorable. We all enjoyed the raspberry cake, which had good texture and balance
3
Their mains are expensive and comes in a very small portion. Note that I'm already a small eater. Also it taste normal nothing fantastic. You can find lot of cheaper and taster meal elsewhere. Their cakes are good though but tad expensive. Average $12 excluding gst and service charge. Frankly I won't go back again even though the service was really good
4
Enjoyed the food and the company. Set dinner was very value for money. Portions might be small for big eaters but tastewise was good overall.
4
Love the ambiance of the place.
However it's pretty pricey.
Didn't have much choice of desserts but the taste was not disappointing
4
I first got a taste of Angelina in Paris and is pretty stoked that thereâ€™s one here in Singapore. The French patisserie at Capitol Galleria, Stamford Road, boasts an impressive array of desserts - you won't know which to try first!For the chocolate enthusiasts, their Choc Africain is a must-try. Drown your tastebuds in its chocolate-y goodness, and come back for mor
5
The hot chocolate is a must try - it is as good as the one you would taste in Paris.The service - better than in Paris. The Paris cafe is always very busy and staff seems under great pressure.in Singapore it is not that busy and the staff is really service oriented
5
I visited Angelina with my mom. We ordered a soup, 2 mains, opera cake and the signature hot chocolate drink. The signature hot chocolate was very good. The complimentary olive bread goes well with the butter. The food was tasty but a bit pricey. We plan on visiting soon. Location was good as it is easily accessible by bus or train
4
very good french food - flavourful, perfectly cooked. praises all around from our table. desserts were also exceptional.just wish staff were a bit more flexible. wanted to change hot chocolate from promo to the iced version because it was a hot day and they were of same value but was firmly told no because POS system only registers hot for the promo. at least was given a cup of ice but only after much persuasion
4
This review is for a visit I did some time back in Dec 2015. Went there with a group of friends for lunch.Obviously we didn't go to Angelina especially for lunch. We were after the Old Fashioned Hot Chocolate L'Africain. Before Angelina Singapore, we need to go to Paris to taste this cup of heavenly chocolate but now it's available near us!I personally enjoy the thick hot chocolate, served with the chantily cream. It's still heavenly, though a friend of us complained a bit that the Singapore version is not as good as what she remembered from Paris.Tried the Pan-fried Scallops on black venere rice with shellfish cream. Scallops were nicely cooked, but I find the whole dish to be too much on the salty side.I almost gave Angelina the average 3 stars rating, but for one thing, I decided to give it 4 stars. It's for the flore. The bright red dessert --- combination of raspberry, meringue, white chocolate, and vanilla mousse --- is one of the best I ever tasted. It is a truly a beautiful dessert. Maybe this is my personal take. Angelina's signature for me is not the overly-sweet Mont Blanc, but the beautiful Flore. I hope they will never take it off the menu, ever
4
Had a lovely pot-Au-feu there last night. And scallops and black rice. It's pulot hitam for those who understand. But done with a seafood sauce. Quite delicious. The cakes with ok, but could have been better presented, as they were about $14++ each. We had the Mont Blanc and an opera. Service by Hamiz was good. We had a nice table. However most of the other tables were really tiny. More for just drinks, I guess
2
I'm a hot-chocolate lover! It's my everyday comfort drinkSo when I heard of how good and rich / thick the hot-chocolate was, I went gagaSince I missed the one in Paris, this is my best chance to tryTo my disappointment the drink fail me so miserably. It's overly thick that it's no longer enjoyable. Soon it turns to torture when I had to share that pot with someone else. I sat there for the next 1.5 hours trying to finish it. I think Coco Black has an even better richness than this. Also, they were ravings about its Mont Blanc but it was so dry, lacking moisture. I'm not sure if the one in Singapore is done differently? But it gives me second thoughts on whether I should go to the one in Paris if I'm back there.Utter disappointment..
2
The coffee was ok (if you like brewed coffee) and the service was good. But this place is somewhat sad as the entire mall does not see many customers. The cakes are way too sweet and not freshly baked (they said they import them from France...). But the biggest drawback is the price. Why would anyone pay these sort of prices for a piece of cake
2
The service was alright, but the main courses we had were bad. The mushroom risotto tasted bitter with just a few strands of mushrooms. The scallop and truffle ravioli was just passable. The signature dessert - Mont Blanc was overly sweet for me.
4
I had the signature Mont-Blanc at Angelina. Meringue, light whipped cream, chestnut cream vermicelli. Enjoyed this interesting dessert.
5
Love the ambience, furnishing & decoration... No complain about the food & service... All has been perfect from the moment I step in till I leave... Will definitely patronise Angelina again... ☺❤
3
We stumbled upon Angelina by accident. It is not easy to find but we had wanted to go there because we have enjoyed Angelina in Paris.We just had a hot chocolate and a tea and we did eye the delightful-looking cakes, but we were to be having an early dinner soon after, so we held back.The staff were good, very attentive, the place was reasonably empty, atmosphere was very much lacking, but if you want hot chocolate and tea, head to Angelina
4
It was a good catch girlie lunch. I had the beef cube not sure why they name it beef cube when it's a steak. It was done medium rare exactly what I wanted. Real truffle fries, highly recommended. The chicken breast was not dry as well though I order the beef! Service was good too. The attentive staff pro actively brought a cushion for the baby chair. Nice gesture!
4
As a French person having lived in Singapore for 6 years now, it's nice to have a touch of home from time to time. Angelina delivers this with it's Parisian theme. It's also located in a convenient place (Capitol Piazza), which makes it a good go-to place for a break in the middle of the workday, or for weekend brunch. I've been there several times, and it is always a pleasure to share a Mont-Blanc with a friend, and to enjoy their absolutely scrumptious hot chocolate. The main difference is that in France, Angelina is mostly known only for its hot chocolates, teas and pastries. But here in Singapore I tried out some savory dishes, including the Truffle ravioli, the 'Pan-seared duck foie gras', and the pumpkin soup - a good range of dishes from light to hearty. It is also very pleasant to see that the Angelina Team is warm and welcoming, not always easy to find in Singapore - or in Paris in fact! I would definitely recommend Angelina for fellow foodies looking for a tasty lunch or dinner, or a sweet treat
3
I had a cup of black coffee and a popular le Mont-blanc (dessert: on-top of the muffin size dessert is with chestnut cream, meringue + whipped cream). I've tried many "mont-blanc" dessert, I personally still prefer "mont-blanc - chestnut dessert" from Japan is still the best. I cant taste the chestnut. I don't really like the combination of meringue with chestnut cream. Is like eating coarse sugar with cream. The coffee (with steam milk) is ok, it comes with a chocolate.Service is good and friendly
4
The place is small but I quite like the Parisian feel, although typically in Paris or Europe, the tables seem more far apart, which gives you more privacy. I'm not sure. We had the brunch set. The coffee was alright, hot chocolate was pretty good but a little rich, pastries were good but rather common. The smoked salmon was alright and the half boiled eggs were fun to eat it from the tiny egg holders. The french toast with caramel sauce was a little too much of carbo for me but you could choose the other which I can't remember what it is. Overall, it was an enjoyable brunch, but I prefer somewhere else if it's only for the food. There are better brunch/breakfast elsewhere. I will still consider returning to try their main courses next time.
3
If you are looking for a place to have tea and hangout on a lazy afternoon, this is a good option. Food and drinks are overpriced in my opinion. You are probably paying for the service and the ambience as well. If you are planning to have food there, it is not bad, just not value for money. The only thing that i truly enjoyed was the truffle fries. Even the signature Mont-Blanc was just average. With that price, you could get much better food somewhere else. I had the hot chocolate. Rich and smooth. I would probably revisit another time just to enjoy the chocolate over a nice book or simple tea with friends
1
Firstly lets get this straight. Angelina Paris is fantastic. Why they would bother to ruin their name with this awfully local singapore version is a mystery. It's half asleep. No receptionist when u walk in . They get all the orders wrong and don't even understand when you ask for certain items that are on their own menu. When ordering an omelette angelina they bring a club sandwich. When you ask for no tomato in the omelette, they still put it it in ... And guess what.. They used tinned tomatoes in an omelette !!! When you ask for an order a side of potatoes Dauphin they don't know what that is. They omit to bring the side as "must charge for it " Waiters are all uninterested in the menu and have a problem understanding an order. The omelette here is half the size of the Paris version ... They probably weighed the eggs and conducted a mathematical profit account before serving it. The only good item on our table was the coffee which was excellent. A total Singaporean comedy ..
5
Excellent service, good food! Praticularly the foie gras. The pastries were good but not extraordinary but the full experience was superb. This is the only Angelina outside France, take advantage and bisit Angelina SG!
3
The hotchocolate here is good. I think they use some real chocolate chunks mixed with cream or milk because from my table I could see the bartender mixing it up. Apart from that this place is a little expensive and the food is regular.
2
We had their signature 3-course set menu. Tried the famous hot choco and famous mont blanc- not really good. Just so so. I prefer the Au Chocolat French Bistro at Marina Bay Sands last time. Way better than their menu.
4
We were looking for a good place for brunch and I saw Angelina appear on one of the food bloggers' recommended places. We didn't even know there's Angelina in Singapore!:) So we decided to give it a try and we weren't disappointed. First of all, j'adore les croissants and pretty much any kind of bread, to be honest, so I totally dug the basket of fresh breads that came with our brunch. The omelette was soft and creamy, a perfect complement to the smoked salmon I ordered with it. And last but definitely not least, the thick and creamy hot chocolate is exactly what yummy dreams are made of. Perfect it certainly was! We will be back for sure
4
Fantastic ambiance, very high end restaurant. Went there for a late tea/supper/dessert after dinner. First time there and the waitress is kind enough to show us an illustrated menu of their desserts to give us an idea of how the dessert looks like, Excellent service. Pastries was great, had no chance to try their beverages thou. Would definitely go back to try
3
We went to Angelina in December 2015 and give it a try for their pastries as it was well advertised in various magazines or newspaper. we cant really share all the hype mentioned and it was nothing what sets them apart from a Laduree or Antoinette to be honest. High prices for a slightly more then average quality and service
3
Looks like it is 2 levels.Cold chocolate wasn't really cold enough. It's like luke warm plus ice. Super rich cocoa. Asked for little cream but it still looks a lot. No Long spoon provided and when I signalled for one, they came with the bill!! They claim it is not normal to include a Long spoon for cold chocolate but then there is no such thing on the menu. Only saw hot chocolate on the menu. But sometimes really really one should use common sense which sadly isn't so common nowadays.I've not had the cold chocolate drink in Paris because the line is usually impossible. So I can't compare.But they are famous for this in Paris and this just doesn't taste 'famous'.They have set breakfasts, brunch, sandwiches, salads, soups, main courses, cheeses, pastries, desserts, macarons, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, Viennese pastries, fruit juices, Soft drinks, beets, champagne, wines and spirits.Just be prepared to pay Angelina prices.There is also a tea time set menu from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for S$49++
5
I had the pleasure of luncheoning at Angelina's recently. What a find! Their truffle ravioli is the perfect rich, velvety comfort food that I'd like to drown myself in after a long day (and might I mention one of the nicest I've tasted in Singapore).The service was impeccable, the ambience makes for the perfect parisienne experience (complete with the essential street-side people watching, even if it's in a mall! :)) The desserts looked sinfully delightful, except I was stuffed by the time they rolled around. But the famed hot-chocolate is on my list of things to try next time - reserved for rainy afternoon with good friends
4
What I love from Angelina is the Tarte Tout Chocolate. The crunchy praline biscuit and the soft dark chocolate ganache alleviated the richness of the tart, I couldn't stop savouring in each bite.The other signature of Angelina is the Old-fashioned Hot Chocolate “L’African”. Just like melted chocolate, smooth and rich, this was definitely not for the faint hearted. The portion came in an entire jug, but was served in smaller cups, accompanied with the whipped cream that complemented the cocoa drink. It was perfect for sharing among us.Read more at UrbanOutEaters to know more about my three times visiting Angelina.I always enjoyed my time and my meal at Angelina. Lovely venue, elegant and kind staff, delicious desserts and the best thick hot chocolate served in a delightful, serious manner
4
It's that hot chocolate that would be worth going back to again and again. Thick, comforting, at the right temperature to sip without the singe, cacao wafts soothingly. Didn't add the cream but just ate it straight as if it were a dessert -- it was good cream on its own! Wary of the chestnut dessert as it was too sweet. Very accommodating staff on a weekend considering I had three extra guests on top of my original reservation for four. Staff even reassigned us to a nicer spot.
3
Honestly, this is a fantastic hot chocolate. Citron tart or Mont Blanc with it and you'll be very happy. The savory menu isn't wonderful, so just go for sweets.
4
Dined at Angelina twice this year 1) Dinner for 2 : good food, although a tad expensive 2) Tea w friends: great dessert (lemon cheesecake is very "lemony" which I love) and the Negresco. Great coffee. We sat upstairs and it was an oasis of calm & solitude amidst the busyness of being downtown.
3
Ordered the famous hot chocolate and it was really very good. Tasted like real chocolate. Just too rich and sweet for me, suggest to share someone if you do order this if not might have sugar rush. I also ordered the lorraine quiche which i thought was really over priced. It tasted like it was microwaved. Nothing special. The salad was very little, just tossed carelessly with some sauce, maybe balsamic vinegar yet doesnt have much taste. The nicest thing on the plate was the cherry tomatoes which i can get from supemarket. So yeah, i am not impressed.
4
I know Angelina from Paris, it may not be the best of its kind, but it is still quite good. If you crave a thick Parisian style hot chocolate with decent whipped cream (hard to come by in Singapore) then this is the place. I also like their croque madame
4
Had dinner at Angelina solo. Ordered the pan fried scallops...The black rice has a taste reminiscent to our local dessert, the Pulut Hitam and eaten together with the shellfish cream and scallops. Awesome!The dessert I ordered is their trademark classic French pastry, the Le Mont-Blanc consists of chestnut paste vermicelli on top and whipped cream and meringue at the bottom. Fabulous but a bit too sweet!Basically, nice ambience, great staff and strongly recommended!Dr E. Cho
4
I tried their pork chop grill and shrimp pasta The pasta I wasn't impressed with, but the pork chop was great. Very tender and juicy. They give you complimentary still waterThe hot chocolate is a must try and best if you share it. A fair warning, the hot choco is very thick and fattening but it's worth to try
1
The food is so so but after our meal they charged us twice on our credit card with same bill by recieving alert twice to handphone! We did complain but no responsible until we call our bank to cancel one bill of charging! Later we show the charging transaction from the bank and the duty manager wont accept the mistake! So far that bring down the so call six stars venue... Hmm
5
I love the high tea time :) Everything is so yummy, just the price quite expensive but it's worth for me :) And the place located at Capitol Galleria, Singapore great building with lots of great place to eat. More please follow instagram : @xiaolingchan or @nyonyokecil

I was there for a casual lunch with 2 business associates. We ordered the 2 course set lunch ($37++) and shared two desserts. Set lunch consisted of a huge salad, which was acceptable in taste and presentation, and wagyu beef pasta. The beef was hard and the tomato sauce was obviously not freshly prepared. It reminded me of the typical $6-$8 pasta at food courts, which is heated up from frozen central kitchen packages. Although the portion was huge, each of us only finished about half the portion as the quality was bad. We decided to save our calorie quota for the desserts.We shared a chocolate eclair and a choux pastry called Josephine. The eclair was good but nothing extraordinary. Josephine was tart and fruity, so it was a welcome light dessert after the heaviness of the beef and pasta. What saved the day was the mini hot chocolate, which reminded me very much of the thick chocolate which I savoy red very morning when I was holidaying in Spain. How I wished I had a churro to dip into the thick chocolate drink! So, have your main meal elsewhere and go to Angelina just for your dessert. This is the place to be seen on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Angelina's tea room and patisserie, has been a popular tea room in Paris since 1903. It opened a branch this year in the new Capitol Plazza, home now to luxury brands, Angelina's ambience was a bit disappointing. It was cramped, tables too near each other. We went to try their signature pastries and hot chocolate, to help a friend complete his Singapore bucket list. The hot chocolate was amazing and so was the Mont Blanc. But they're both rich and heavy so best after a light meal. We didn't try the mains. Like all trendy new cafes opening up here, prices are on the higher side. Service was pleasant

It’s a little on the expensive side, but we had a wonderful dinner. Staff was very knowledgeable about gluten free. All in all it was a good experience.

I was so thrilled when I first got wind that THE Angelina Tearoom from Paris would be opening a new branch right here in Singapore! I’d been to the Angelina Tearoom in Rue de Rivoli in Paris (for the curious, it is located near to Westin Paris Vendome). The kewl Tearoom with beautifully decorated interiors once played host to Coco Chanel and Proust who were regulars at the Tearoom. I was curious to know if the Angelina outlet in Singapore could match up to its parent.I’ve read many online reviews criticizing the slow service. Well, just so you know - I NEVER visit a restaurant/cafe/tearoom - during the first 2 weeks of their official opening. You need to give the staff time to be trained and get up to speed! I went after the 3rd week of their opening - on a weekend - at 12 noon and I wasn’t disappointed.It was crowded but they managed to get me a table. The tables here - especially for 2 persons is small. But the cafe brought out additional small tables to ensure that our dining experience would be noting but fantastic. We were served by an amazing waitress named Pamela. After the meal, I was asked to fill in a Feedback form. Needless to say, I gave Pamela and the team full marks for service and everything else listed in the form.I had a wonderful Brunch experience. It really is very value-for-money to have Brunch here. The Angelina Brunch is priced at S$39.00++ per pax and is available until 2.30pm - daily

Well I absolutely loved Angela in Paris and expected the same kind of vibes. Unfortunately this cafe is seriously tiny and feels hidden not as massive and open spaced as the French one. The chocolate drink I had, i think I ordered wrongly feels like I am drinking cocoa. Which means, i can't drink it.

On my recent visit to Singapore, I came across Angelina, a French café in the heart of the city, and decided to indulge myself! It took me straight back to my many visits to Paris. From the delicious hot chocolate to the decadent pastries. It was a great experience and would happily recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore! Oh and if you are a fan of sweet dishes then you must try the Mont Blanc, it’s to die for

 Decided to try this new place and had to wait for 20mins until we asked a staff of we could grab a seat upstairs. Had asked for mayo for my fries but the waiter was too busy to remember the request. When another came with the dessert, we didn't have forks for the cake. Luckily the lady serving us was still attentive. They really need more training for their staff. Unlikely coming back for awhile

I been to Angelina twice.The first visit, was during their soft launch. I reached earlier than my friend and served by Joseph. He patiently introduced Angelina's signature dishes and desserts to me and I ordered his recommendation, Mushroom Risotto, Signature Hot Chocolate and Mont Blanc. I personally really love the signature Hot Chocolate and the Mont Blanc, YES, they are SWEET. I read some comments that the signature Hot Chocolate was not HOT. I would say the temperature of the hot chocolate was just nice to drink as a dessert, if too hot, I would not enjoy to continue one sip to another non-stop. (hehe...) I had requested to warm up my hot chocolate again after I finished my Mushroom Risotto. I love the signature Mont Blanc with meringue base, the "thick" chestnut puree wins my heart... It was so "lovely". The Mushroom Risotto was a bit "too much"... Joseph saw my face after tasted the risotto, he stepped forward and asked for my comments. I told him, "It was a moist and creamy risotto, but additional pine nuts had overtake the mushrooms' taste". He immediately back to the kitchen and informed the chef my comments and asked me if I want to change the Mushroom Risotto to other main course on the menu without any obligations. (I was really embarrassing, I felt I am a picky customer.)Well, I would only say Angelina is too generous.That is really true when my friend ordered a Caeser Salad as she was on diet (Bad timing and she is not a sweet tooth person). When I looked at the Menu, I was bothering by its price on the menu, is at the higher side for a Ceaser Salad. But it is worthy, my friend was satisfied, the portion is enough for 2 person sharing, the ingredients is fresh and delicious. Overall : ☆☆☆ 3.8Food : ☆☆☆☆ 4.0Service : ☆☆☆☆ 4.0 I'm aware they are young who probably less experience in F&B service industry. Give them a chance and they trying to do their best too.Atmosphere : ☆☆☆ 3.5Great Location. But partially of the restaurant was high ceiling, it would be a bit warm during the hot weather especially in Singapore. Solid woods furniture, is grand but heavy. Limited space

(note: did NOT try the cake, so not an all-encompassing review)Three of us came here at 12pm on a Saturday, the place wasn't full but more people starting coming in at around 1230pm. Ordered an iced tea, a glass of Merlot, truffle fries and the signature hot chocolate (which was SGD12). My friend like the iced tea (I didn't try), she said it was fragrant and had other fruit essences in it so it was like iced tea with a twist. The truffle fries were fine. I was excited for the hot chocolate, but it turned out to be just okay. It wasn't hot enough and was too sweet - yes it's chocolate, but the sweetness balance was off. I actually liked the Max Brenner (Vivocity) hot chocolate better. The tables are really small, we had two tables pushed together and when all the plates/glasses arrived, it felt really packed. Service was okay. Unfortunately the whole area still smells like paint/construction. From what I've read about the Paris branch, this place is definitely not comparable

If you have an afternoon off, drop by Angelina . They have their famous Chocolate drink and great choux pastries . Very French !

Only had cakes and tea. Did not have the signature hot chocolate as it seemed too sweet since it came pre-sweetened. Tea was a signature blend and has a pleasant orange flavour. Ordered three cakes - an opera, a mango passion cheesecake and the mont blanc. Of the three the Opera was the most successful. The cheesecake was the worst as it seemed to have assimilated some of the flavours of other foods it was stored with in the fridge. I cannot explain but it definitely was not pleasant.I wasn't impressed enough to return to sample the other dishes

Due to the local newspaper recommendations, we visited this café on my sister birthday. My intention was to give her a good surprise but ended with a big disappointment.We ordered their famous hot chocolate drink and Mount Blanc cake. For the hot chocolate drink, it turn out very thick, not hot at all and taste like medicine. The worst hot chocolate drink we ever had in Singapore. For the famous Mount Blanc cake, the outer brown colour cream was still hard (not de-froze enough) and obviously the cake was just taken out from the freezer not long ago.The bills was $60.05 for 2 drinks and 2 piece of cakes. We will never come back to this unprofessional café again

The entire place was really cramped and had the feel of a cafe that was trying too hard to be upmarket (but failing disastrously at it). Service was poor and slow and their famous Mont Blanc cake was probably the most awful cake I've ever eaten in my life, with chestnut cream that was overpoweringly sweet and so dense that you could have stuck a fork in it and not have your fork threaten to fall out at all. Upon checking with the staff, I realised this was because their cakes are flown over from France (which to me, simply means their cakes aren't fresh and which lack of freshness showed up in each bite).Their other signature was their hot chocolate drink. This fared a little better but was too thick and rich to be enjoyed beyond the first few sips.With such stiff competition from other cafes and dessert places in Singapore, it's hard to imagine this place doing well beyond the first 6 months in Singapore

Had a rare Monday afternoon off and thought of checking out the new Capitol Piazza when we came across Angelina. We ordered the onion soup, ham and cheese club sandwich and a cold cut/cheese appetizer. The servings were really generous I must say..the onion soup which my hubby had was really nice but the bread of the club sandwich seemed fried and it was quite cheesy too. We ended with a lemon tart which my hubby liked but sour desserts are not my cup of tea. Overall was a pleasant experience..service was very good and I will go back to try their chocolate desserts and maybe brunch menu!

We chose Angelina Restaurant / Tea Room because of its quaint, sophisticated beauty and because Coco Chanel frequents this elegant exquisivity (in France itself, of course) often. The exterior suggested a classic touch of elegance while the interior exuded artistic charm and comfort amongst a strong French setting.For mains, *L had the Truffle Ravioli (SGD$29.00) - tiny little jagged squares of pasta stuffed with cheese. Lovers of cheese would gladly indulge in this pasta dish, sinking their teeth into the firm pasta so that the burst of cheese could fill the mouth deliciously - truffle hints were detected amongst the cheesy indulgence.*J went for the Wild Mushroom Risotto (SGD$23.00) - actually all three of us were eyeing this dish. It did not disappoint, not with its rather generous serving of truffles, rocket salad and brothy-rice. The flavour could have been a little stronger, more sapid with mushroom taste, but we were only able to taste it here if we bit into one of the shrooms pieces literally. I also thought that the grains were cooked till too mushy, lacking the bite that I usually enjoy in risotto dishes.For me, I chose to have the Steamed Black Cod (SGD$35.00) served with Shellfish and seasonal vegetables. Black cod always contains a scrumptious buttery smoothness to its texture, combined with a taut, slightly springy tone; the flesh was saccharine. I also enjoyed mussels and clams, being a seafood lover. But oh, the broth, the broth was the ultimate climax - combining the goodness of the seafood and every sip drew out the need to want more; even the soft baby potatoes were sufficiently immersed with the tasty broth.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lunch-at-angelina-tea-room-patisserie.htm

When my hubby and I vacationed in Paris back in 2011, we tried Angelina Paris Patisserie for high tea. The place was really posh and classy with their unique architecture. Of course, the price also a bit steep.My hubby and I feel that it was not bad so we decided to try the newly opened outlet in Singapore. We were there at 2.30 pm and we got our seat without waiting.We ordered Coco tea and their signature Mont Blanc Tea suggested by the staff. Besides, we ordered Angelina Omelette, macaron and lemon tart. However, the lemon tart did not served, probably they forgot about it. I love their tea, it has the coco smell and nice. The macaron isnt the best which i had before but the atmosphere was really great and relaxing. Great place for chatting while having high-tea

The Citron Tarte's crust was slightly soggy, Le Mont Blanc's chestnut paste was too sweet and heavy. The taste and texture fail to balance even as we ate it with the cream under the blanket of chestnut paste.Bestie's iced chocolate was not smooth but my marron tea smells heavenly and was delicious.To be honest, I was disappointed because the two standard tarts that I go for didn't meet my expectations for this cafe

When I vacationed in Paris back in 2014, I stayed near an Angelina Paris Patisserie but never got a chance to dine in because of its queue. Now that we have one at the newly revamped Capitol Piazza, I jumped at the opportunity to check out its goods and validate its reputation.We were lucky to be the only ones in the queue on a Sunday afternoon. We also chanced upon an empty table by the sidewalk. The circular table was petite, to say the least and hardly meant for large meals. Luckily, a rectangular side table was put to good use. Water was served without us having to ask. The menu showcased their cakes, each piece literally a work of art; and also offered other dishes for a fuller and more complete meal.We ordered the signature Le Mont-Blanc (which solidified Angelina Paris' reputation ever since 1903) and the Tentation. As with all cakes, they were sweet and looked temptingly pretty. In fact, it took me all of 15 minutes before I decided to take a bite as I sat there admiring their designs.Service was good but not fantastic as they had to contend with the crowd, ever streaming in but not overwhelming so. At the end, its prices were not unexpected, but to experience a little Paris in Singapore, why not

We went as a party of 8. As the place is not big, if you have a big group like us, prepare to wait. We waited for 40 min before we were seated. Service was good despite the fact that they are evidently under staffed.We ordered 3 mains, 2 starters and 4 desserts. The sandwiches and risotto were Gd. The chocolate tart and the opera were my fav even tho Mont Blanc is what they are known for.Overall a gd place to laze around for an afternoon.
