Of the four Rakuichi's outlets, the one at Greenwich V must be the quietest of all. So if you relish having a peaceful and quiet Japanese meal, this is the place to go. Besides sushi, the set meals are good-value-for money and are available for both lunch and dinner. Worth a try is the Wagyu & Salmon Set $35.90 as well as the Gindara (grilled cod fillet) & Tempura Set $30.90. Their Grilled Chicken Teriyaki $ Barachi Set $22.90 is really value-for-money and my children really enjoyed the bowl of mixed rice served with raw fish like salmon and tuna. You can also add a bowl of chawanmushi at $2 or at $6 for chawanmushi and a dessert

The wait staff were helpful to help me select the desired food for our dinner. We tried the ramen, Sushi and sashimi don. The wait time of the food is relatively short and the ambience of the restaurant has a black colour theme but it is brightly lighted up.

They have 3 branches in Singapore. I went to the one in Far East shopping center (orchard road) and also the one at Dempsey hill. The food is really good and fresh. All food are freshly imported even the salt they use is sea salt. Sometimes they have some seasonable fish. Their grill stuff is also very good. It's highly recommended but the pride is on the high side. The restaurant is also nicely furnished. Staff service is good though most of time I like to sit at bar counter
