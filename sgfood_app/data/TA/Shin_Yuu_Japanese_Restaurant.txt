Great variety of hand rolls and sushi. Keep ordering. Wafu beef, scallops and beef short ribs are my favorites. Good value for money if you have an appetite.

The pros : buffet price but order from a menu, very prompt service and generous portions. Good sashimi also.
The cons : cleanliness of the toilets to be improved.

Friday night for sushi at the last moment so took a place at the bar. Very fresh food as although a buffet you order from the menu and it's prepared straight away. Sashimi was good, hands rolls especially the spicy tuna and soft shell crab were excellent. Try the sliced beef - it melts. Also did half price saki which was a bonus. I am not sure that made much out of me as I might have eaten most things on the menu...it was that good

Recently I had dinner here with my family. This is my second time here at the restaurant.Dinner is buffet style but through ordering from a menu. You could order as many times as you like. The service was excellent and the waitresses were patient and friendly.My family likes the beef and the cheese scallops while I liked the grilled prawns.The sashimi were also generous in portion. The price is around S$52 per person. It is a little expensive but sashimis are never cheap.In terms of the taste of the food, it is not as fantastic as it used to be (the food we had for our first visit years ago appears to be much better). However, it is still a nice place to visit if you want to eat lots of sashimis without having to worry about spending over 50 dollars. By the way, the drinks are not included in the buffet dinner

Was there Tuesday for lunch with a few good friends. This was my first visit to Shin-Yuu Japanese restaurant, service was superb!! Really really loves their side dish, "Lady Fingers". Their grilled fish and unagi are dishes you won't want to miss too!! YUMMY Yum Yum!!

The ala carte menu is extensive, portions are generous, food is above average ! A place where my teenage boys love to go with their freinds, especially with their pay price of 3 for 4 to eat. Service is prompt. No questions and frowns when we repeatedly requests for the same dish

This restaurant serves ala carte buffet Sushi, where we can order and eat sushi as much as we want. They charge S$ 39.90 ++ per pax for lunch, which I believe little bit expensive.Food taste is pretty good, I like the hand roll, sirloin steak and a few others. The raw sashimi salmon and grilled Mackerel are not really my favorite though.If you really like Sashimi variants then the $39.90++ price tag for lunch maybe worth it, otherwise better go for ala carte type of Japanese restaurant
