In Changi Business Park, with a fair bit of competition around, it was a surprise to find such a place serving great coffee and snacks. Open early, friendly service, well priced and above all the place didn't resemble a shared office space (like some more Corporate chains)...

One of the really few places that open at 7 am, for the larks amongst you. Tucked away in Changi Business Park (closest hotels Park Avenue and Capri by Fraser), near to Swissbake, Knead to Eat, and Killiney. Does a very reasonable Sumatran Kopi O (black coffee) at $1.90, but those discerning javaholics can find a wider variety of more expensive brews, too. What is amazing is the presence of pastries, pies and other bakery treats even first thing in the morning. I tried the chocolate croissant, and it was good.Premises are small with some (but limited) seating, but clean, airconditioned and pleasant. What's not to like

Every morning - I snipping on a hot cappuccino with latte art and croissants 'nom nom nom' for breakfast - Tip: heat your croissants. This is the place where everything is better and everything is safe. This place always filled with happy people who loves to smile, laugh, and joke from all around the world. Life is better when you insert coffee to begin laughing with coffee lovers. Good coffee ends with good talk. Come in smell your brewing coffee
