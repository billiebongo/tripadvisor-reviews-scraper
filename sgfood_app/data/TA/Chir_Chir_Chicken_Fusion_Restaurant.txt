Had a early dinner here with my friends. Ordered a spicy rice cake
with seafood which we really like it. So spicy yet tasty. Then ofcourse we ordered the fried chicken as well. Both dishes were fantastic.

Had decided to try out the Chir-Chir, it's nothing special. Their "Korean" fried chicken doesn't taste much better than those you get at KFC.
It's overhyped and overpriced, you're better off getting cheaper options elsewhere.

Possible the best Korean fried chicken in Singapore! Always get the original one to share - or not. Interesting selection of drinks too.
4
"Fusion" is a fun way to look at this. It's delicious chunks of chicken smothered in various sauces, cheeses, seasonings, etc. It was fantastic, although it seemed more appropriate for dining for two. I felt like a real fatty eating there by myself.

Dined here on New Years Eve at then Chinatown point outlet as there was no queue. The roasted garlic cHicken is tender and flavourful. We also liked that they provide plastic gloves but u need to ask for them. Agree with the other reviewers that it would be good if they have single portions because as a couple, we struggled a bit to finish that one mains and we did not order sides. Would have like to be able to just come back and eat alone and try other flavours but you definitely need 2 at least

If you are a fan of Korean Fried Chicken, do not miss this! Tried half original crispy chicken and half "garlicky" favor, very tender and not too oily! Goes well with the mango salad! The interesting thing is the restaurant provides a nice little metal pick that allows you to pick up and tear the hot chicken pieces apart without getting your fingers oily.

Visited this joint with my SO during a weekday afternoon. The place wasn't crowded then but I've heard that queues can get pretty crazy. We ordered the cheesy rice cake and the soya sauce fried chicken. This place does not serve tap water so you'll have to buy your own. The chicken was amazing but the cheesy rice cake was pretty mediocre.The portion size was rather huge. Service wise as it was not busy the staff were very attentive.

I am a local and was with a friend at 313 Somerset when we decided to try out Chir Chir since there wasn't a queue. (The restaurant used to have really long queue at all other times I visited the mall.)Firstly, I am very bad at eating anything spicy and boy was I glad that they have a wide range of non-spicy flavors available. I was contemplating between the mac 'n' cheese, all the 'cheesy' chicken options, and also roasted garlic chicken. Chose the garlic one at the end as the picture on the menu looked too good to resist. Was a tiny bit upset that I couldn't try more since each portion is meant for two. So go with a big group of people if you can!We waited 20mins for the food to come, and honestly, it was well worth it! It actually looked even better than the picture. Taste wise, it's probably the best korean/garlic chicken I've eated. At my age, barely any food surprises me anymore. The garlic chicken far exceeded my expectations and I find myself constantly thinking about it all the time.I heard that the beer with the whipped cream is awesome as well and I can't wait to be back for the garlic chicken as well as to try all the other dishes I was eyeing
4
I visited the outlet of Orchard 313, Bedok and Chinatown. I had tired their fried chicken and BBQ chicken. I still prefer the Spicy BBQ as the sauce is very tasty and even the breast meat is tender. The mango salad go well with the chicken as too many fried stuff or meat will get bored too. Another recommendation is the Mac & Cheese, there's few different type of cheese and it is serving in a hot pan. The staff was attentive too, I do not have to wait and order my food but pls note that the BBQ chicken take 20 mins to be cooked. In the meant time, we could enjoy our salad and Mac & cheese first
4
Good choices of chicken wings recipes and beer with whipped cream. It was new for me and quite enjoyable. The service was efficient and the place was clean. I recommend this place if you want good chicken wings with heavy seasoning such as cheese, whipped cream and more.2 Dishes for three guys was perfect
4
Was quite a wait for the meal. The chicken set TOP up for 2 Flavours (original and spicy) was certainly worth it! Chicken with mustard sauce can be surprisingly delicious too.
The grapefruit yoghurt jug is suitable for 2 pax only.
4
Been here with my friend, we had spicy tteokbokki. It was good, hot & really spicy. We share this because the portion is quite big. We did try the mac&cheese and it was good also.
4
It was my first visit with a friend and we decided to order a portion of the garlicky chicken.
One portion is enough for 2 of us and we both loved it! Will come again soon!
4
Visited the outlet at Bugis. When for the garlic cum original fried chicken combi and the passion soda drink. The drink is enough to fill 4 glasses. The chicken is a tad too much for 2 adults. Preferred the garlic chicken which was delicious. There's quite a lot of seats available at this outlet
2
Tried my first attempt during dinner. Walked 2 tables occupied, but within 30mins. Almost 98% occupied. Looking through the menus, was quite reluctant to order as there were not much choices. So me and my female colleague asked the service crew to recommend and helped us order. Bad choice made. She ordered a whole spring chicken for us 2 ladies. We did not finished the chicken as it wasnt fantastic at all. KFC or 4 fingers beat them down anytime. I have to admit it is based on personal perference. But their drinks and chicken is really nothing fantastic
4
This is the first time that I had ever tried the Korean chicken though it's been in Singapore for some time.Was pretty apprehensive in the beginning but since my friends wanted to eat here, just follow. The chicken comes in many different flavors which were pretty good. Ordered the Mac and cheese and it was ok. There were no carbo to go with the chicken except the Korean rice cakes that came with one plate of the chicken.Overall quite a good dining experience just that the service was a tat too slow for my liking
5
I went to the branch at Bugis Junction. It was pretty empty because me and my friend went during afternoon. We ordered Chir Chir Mir Chir, is like a cream + cheese + pasta + chicken dish and another dish was a spicy toppoki(which the staffs keep saying it was really really spicy). Surprising it turns out not that spicy, just average, and I'm not really a fan of spicy food. We finished the chir chir mir chir, it was such a huge portion, but it tasted so good! The toppoki dish on the other hand was average to me
3
First time to try Chir Chir Chicken at Jems. We ordered 2 different types of fried chicken, i think one is garlicky chicken while another one was spicy. Get more people to go so that you can have more variety as the potion was quite huge. Two portion was just nice for 4 persons, after some struggling to finish it. The price was not cheap, I don't think the food worth for the price
4
So far so good only try two of the dishes . It's to the expensive side but the portions are big so I recommend to go in groups. The chicken there are delicious . The spicy chicken are spicy but it's my favorite. Great services. So sorry as I have no pics was too caught with the food and dating hahaha but overall it's grea

I saw few of my friends posted The photos of Chirchir. So me and hubby decided to give it a try when we r in town. Bugis outlet. I love the tea with ginseng and honey. The taste of the fried chicken is ok for 'korean fried chicken' nothing special except the portion..
3
Took out an order of signature fried wings from this restaurant as it seems to be a current local favourite, but am honestly questioning what makes this unique.
5
...B3 313 Orchard Road Sngapore....the roasted chicken...absolute delicious...very good service and friendly staff.
4
I am not an alcoholic drinker. However, the Lady Killer that I consumed had fruity taste which is refreshing. And it does not taste bitter at all. I love it.
5
Love their Topokki and Cheese! A must to have at Chir Chir if you're a cheese lover! Cheese fries are pretty good too. The garlic chicken tenders were kind of salty though, not marinated well enough but the chicken itself was delicious.
4
Ordered the spicy chicken, honey chicken and a spicy chicken with rice cake thingy and the dua. On separate days, of course. Love all the spicy chicken but love-hate the honey chicken as it can get quite gelat. The staff who served us was quite blur. She didnt know how many pieces of chicken wings/drumsticks there were in a single dish and didnt know to check for us. She just replied 'I dont know' when we asked and stared at us blankly. Nothing major, quite a funny moment actually. Each dish is for 2 pax and can be quite pricey. I wish they have single servings though, so we can try more varieties. All is good and will return for more yummy chicken

There is an unquestionable novelty where Chir Chir's succulent chicken matters - delectable in its unique Korean way. The cheese mac dish is rich but not overwhelming, tender yet with a bite. The fries are meaty and seasoned to please. Delightful.Service is just the right dose to get things done. No frills. Nothing fancy. Practical and unpretentious. Unheard of.For the 3 of us, the sizeable portions were well shared. Had it been for 2 diners, the outlet's serving size might well have meant having to struggle to clean up our plates. Management should re-engineer portion control to facilitate tasting orders. Can do?All in, a comfortable experience - casual,unhurried ... and 'shiok'. For sure

The Koreans sure know how to do good fried chicken- crispy on the outside (sometimes smothered in yummy sauce) and moist on the inside. Chir Chir is no exception in its fried chicken. Its salad though, just like other Korean chicken eateries, is uninspired and flat. We had the mango salad which came with mango cubes and flat pale lettuce. There were no nuts or seeds to add crunch and the dressing was a one dimensional yoghurt. There was almost a lack of effort. If they can overcome their weaknesses, they will be quite good.
4
I was told that the fried chicken is good and popular and you have to queue up as well.Indeed the fried chicken was great which is much better than KFC Singapore. There was queue when I visited on Monday night at Chinatown branch. The MAC and cheese was superb. Staffs were friendly and dining experience was good as well. If possible, do provide tomato sauce instead of just Chili and mustard sauce. Overall, it is good and recommended to visit agai

Went to try Chir Chir Chicken @ Chinatown Point. Queue was very long (45 mins) - order also took a long time to come out. The food was tasty. The spicy chicken is really spicy. Price was reasonable ~ considering the portion.Atmosphere is cafe like and is very noisy as people try to out talk everyone else. But otherwise a nicely decorated place. Food were presented nicely ~ making the food looks enticing.Beware of your order, portion is actually quite big. I would recommend anyone to try.. If they are a big fan of chicken but if you would like to go for the spicy one ~ be prepared to drink plenty of water. I'll be coming back for more.

Went to the one at Chinatown for late night dinner. The menu had much more varieties form when I last visited months ago. We had the garlicky and normal fried chicken, topped up with spicy chili sauce. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy. The Ladykiller cocktail was awesome

2nd time patronising this outlet at 313 Somerset. Service is good, food portion big. Yummilicious.
Worth to visit again!
5
Chicken fusion is amazing, not only in taste but also the kind of options they have. Dish size is good for two. Be ready to spend INR 1,000 to 1,500 per person
5
The fried chicken were well coated and fried to such a crisp they crackled when bitten. Though prices may be on the higher side, the amount of chicken that arrived per order is enough to fill two or more diners.
3
So due to the hype of the korean fried chicken, decide to go down to try.It's all in dishes of 2 pax, meaning have to go in group. Food is huge portion, but only the sauce is different. Same fried chicken base, drizzle on different sauce.So you can get sick if it after the third piece.Price is expensiv
5
Simple restaurant setting. Many varieties of fried chicken meals from original deep fried, chilli sauce and to caramel infused. Comes with rice-cakes & potato wedges too. Must try the cream cheese grape salad. Children will like it a lot. Price is average but worth trying something new
4
This is the first time we have been to a Korean fusion restaurant. But it was nice! Did not expect the pasta to be nice but it was. Fried chicken was (expectedly) yummy. Rosemary chicken was nice too.Only disappointment was that the truffle fries was somewhat soggy because of the cheese. Finger licking' good!
5
We had the most awesome friend chicken at Chir Chir. Crispy on the outside and tender + juicy on the inside. The servings are huge. We also shared a mango salad. The mango pieces were generous but not all were sweet. Service was prompt and the environment is clean and sanitized. We will visit again.

In Summary:Good to try at least once. I’m not a fan of Korean fast food but it is definitely better than the likes of Four Fingers.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:Decided to try this after my partner found raving reviews of this restaurant online and from her friends.1. Service – 3 out of 5The waitress that served us was quite impatient initially as we read through the menu. We were prompted to order thrice within 5 minutes. There were many choices and we explained to the waitress that it was our first visit. She showed some form of understanding after that and advised us to take the set meal.2. Ambiance – 3.5 out of 5The restaurant is well-decorated right to the minor details, from napkins to walls.3. Cleanliness – 5 out of 5The owner must be some cleanliness fanatic! From laying table mats, to providing gloves and also a clamp to pick the chicken pieces up, you can be assured of the cleanliness.4. Taste – 3 out of 5The drink was prepared in an extravagant manner but tasted very much like grape syrup. There is an option to add a shot of vodka for a few dollars more. You may have more luck with that. Mac and cheese was well baked but nothing spectacular. The highlight – fried chicken wings – tasted very normal with sweet chili sauce coated over it.5. Value for Money – 2 out of 5I have not much love for Korean fast food, and I do think that for fried chicken, this is severely overpriced
5
Saw this place while in Somerset@313 and noticed a huge line so went to see what the fuss was all about and I gotta say it is the best fried Korean style chicken I have had outside of Korea. Generous serves and we washed it down with a cocktail called a Lady Killer which I highly recommend
5
We were a party of three and ordered a portion of crispy chicken and another one of rosemary chicken. They were delicious! The chicken was tender and tasty. The portions are huge, one of them could easily satisfy three people. We actually had to take home a lot of chicken leftovers. We also ordered a passion fruit mocktail and it was very refreshing. It combined well with our meal. Staff is very nice and they are always in a good mood. We will be back again in the future. Worth the experience
4
my 2nd visit and i still love it! cant get enough of their mac and cheese. . . the portions are big and the chicken fillets are really succulent and tender!! yummmy
3
Tasty chicken, but pricey. Chicken with bones are better than the chicken tender. Chicken with sauce better than the deep fried ones. Interesting drinks made with carbon dioxide sparkling machine.
4
Even the salad is chicken. Various variants of chicken. Differently flavoured and differently prepared. Must prepare to queue up especially lunch and dinner times. Maybe good the first time but indifferent after a few times. Not cheap but big servings.
4
The chicken is kind of expensive. I somehow prefer the spicy ones that the Signature Nest Snow (which is made of chicken tender). I do not find it very addictive but the chicken is not too bad. Can try it once in your life.
4
this place is a one of a kind...chicken meals at its craziest..from fried to roasted and in all toppings..very interesting and fun..and they all look appetizing.....the roasted chicken was tasty, didnt feel full even after the 5th piece..be forewarned: the portions are huge even for two but manager provides doggie bag..and its even better for humans...meals can be eaten with rubber gloves and finger tweezers ..bit steep so be prepared to pay up...but wouldn't mind coming in and trying the rest of the men

Ordered mixed of Garlic and Spicy Chicken. They are really delicious and I can't imagine anyone will not love it. Portion is also reasonable. Something different from the usual fried chicken we always have. Just to take note, they service the WHOLE fried chicken, which means we have fried chicken head, although we do not know if this is expected or not. (almost all fried pieces looks similar) But of course we skip that. Unless you like chicken brain.The queue is always long, wait for more than 30mins even though we reach around 6pm. But the wait is worth it! I recommend anyone should try it at least 1 time. Go during off peak timing to avoid long queues
5
Love this place! The portions are huge! We ordered the Mango Salad, Garlicky Chicken, Spicy Chicken and the chicken salad. Service was really good too :) . We managed to try their mac & cheese hehe! I guess the main highlight was the spicy chicken as it is really good! (Its pretty addictive!) Mango salad is pretty good too, especially when the mango is sweet hehe! Their mac & cheese isn't as cheesy as i thought. I guess its worth trying even for people who don't fancy cheesy food. I tried their ladykiller as well! LOVE IT.Definitely a pleasant experience
4
We came here for lunch and it wasn't crowded so the eating experience was pleasant. Service was good and prompt. Food wise, it's very tasty and flavourful. I especially love the garlicky chicken! If you're adventurous, try their chicken feet. It's super spicy! The only thing I didn't like was the price. Expensive

Family dinner time.We took almost an hour queueing for a table outside. While waiting we peeked at what other tables ordered.We noticed that a common dish that almost everyone ordered was the Snow Nest Chicken. Served on a hotplate and well presented. The fruit concotion also caught our eyes. The syrup was aerated by a unique device and poured into the juice resulting in a gassy juice drink.The mango salad came very promptly. It was nice and fresh fruit-vegetable salad.The Snow Nest chicken took a while to come out. However it was well worthed the wait as it was quite nice. The flavour was well balanced and the chicken was fried crispy.Since we were not full at the end, we ordered another dish: the garlicky fried chicken. Again, it took a while to prepare.But again, well worth the wait.The bill came out to be S$35 per paxSo, if you have money to spare then by all means, come and enjoy yourselves here
5
First time eating here at Chir Chir and I'm hooked. Love the way they cooked the chicken. The price may be a little ex but because the food is really delicious therefore i am able to accept it. Spent about $250/= for the 13 of us (2 chicken dish, 2 fries, 6 drinks). Each dish can be shared between 2-4 persons depends on individuals. They have very interesting drinks too. The serving is big, you'd have to share it
