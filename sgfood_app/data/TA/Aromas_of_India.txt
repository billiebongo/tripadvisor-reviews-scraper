The food was very good -great naan and curries. Only complaint, however, is that there was a strange odour in the restaurant, perhaps of dirty dish towels. Nonetheless was not a terrible dinner as the food made up for it.
4
Very nice spot to eat, air con, just off main road.
Staff were very attentive and service was very quick.
Food was very good (although I have never eaten in India). Serving sizes were good
Beer was very cheap.
Menu was large
5
Highly recommended ‘ awesome food great service ‘ best dishes butter chicken ‘ lamb roganjosh ‘ garlic naan . Fish tikka ‘must try
5
Best place to eat indian cusine.good varieties of food and drinks. good ambience for spend quality time with friends and family

The most important thing for a restaurant is how the food is tasting. Well, this one is definitely a good example of tasty dishes. It's not cheap and not very cozy inside, but the food was excellent. Would definitely recommend it for the food.
1
We were the only customers there that afternoon. And rightfully so. The food was average, the service lackadaisical.
3
We had wandered around Little India looking for dinner, and happened upon Aromas of India. As we were looking on from outside a local stopped and said it would be a good choice, "was the best Indian restaurant around", so in we went. It was around 7 p.m. and all the restaurants (there are quite a few in the area) were getting busy.The menu is quite extensive. We ordered some Tiger beers, very cheap by Singaporean standards at SGD3.50 and later our meal. Service though was slow, and the staff not attentive, took ages to attract the waiters attention for a second beer.The food though was very good, nicely cooked, though rather more spiced than we are accustomed to back in the UK. There is no indication on the menu of the level of 'heat', which would have been useful when making choices.I would describe the decor as being a bit 'rough and ready', even the menu cards had seen many better days and were much stained with food etc.The restaurant food is good, the rating is just average because of the rather indifferent service and experience overall.Expect to pay around SGD30 per person for a meal and some beer
4
I was solo, otdered too much. rice and bread, two beers, chicken as starter and fish. All spicy versions, i like it.It could have been perfect, but the menu needs new printing, a bit of upgrading the toilet will make it.Go there, worth it
5
Had a really tasty meal here. Great food, service excellent ... will definitely make a note of this place to visit next time in Singapore, and just a very short walk from Little India MRT. Hmmm, interesting the only negative reviews seem to be from Singapore ........ suspicious its competitors
5
My husband, myself & my son & his family visited the Aromas of India restaurant in Little India & were delighted with the food & service. Nothing was too much trouble for them & as my little granddaughter isn't ready for spicy food yet, they realized this & made sure her buttered chicken was very mild. She loved it! Not only was the food so good, the staff couldn't do enough for us. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to all who enjoy good, authentic Indian food
5
This was a real find. Small and intimate with Icy cold beer, great service and true Indian food. Sam is a very informative host and describes his dishes well if you want to know more about what you are ordering.
4
The food over here is truly Indian . Its authentic and tasty and the service is really good as well.
4
The food is very good. The staff are friendly and do their best to make the food to your taste. Simple and clean.
5
Absolutely loved my meal here. Service was good, food was amazing and price was cheap. I recommend the Gobi Manchuria and boneless chicken biryani. Makes me hungry just thinking about it!
5
It was a quiet midweek evening so service was fast and the meal was truly delicious. There are a number of restaurants along this stretch but I feel we chose wisely
4
went there for dinner. the place is not big in little India. service is good. the attendant was very friendly. food was served quickly. the food is excellent. on of the best Indian food you can have in Singapore. make sure you try the spicy mushroom appetizer
4
The food here was delicious and came very quickly after ordering. The curries had lots of flavour and you could tell the naans had just been freshly made by hand. Unfortunately once the food was served they were not very attentive at all. And we sat with dirty plates on the table for over 10 minutes. It wasn't until I motioned to them that they prised themselves of their phone. When we first looked in the restaurant only had another table eating - it was 9pm. However, two Indian restaurants down the road were very full. This rang an alarm bell, but We had read good reviews so continued in to the restaurant. We were not disappointed. Don't be put off by the lack of customers. They seemed to do a roaring trade with takeaways and the food is great.
2
I had dinner at Aromas of India 2 weeks ago with much anticipation unfortunately to my surprise the food is not up to standard given their location. The napkin they presented me looks like it had be partially used, when i asked for a change of serviette they gave me with another one that look unclean as well. The food is way to spicy even for local standard. They used a lot of spice without real taste. It was almost impossible to get attention from the servers whenever you need to order or get your bill. I was supposed to get a 40% discount as I booked through an app but when they present me the bill they only gave me 10%
5
Aromas of India looked after my family as if they were their own! I am from Australia and flew to Singapore to celebrate my wedding with family there. Aromas of India took care everything last minute, they arranged the whole dinner at the budget I requested. They patiently waited for everyone to arrive (which took over an hour). They organised beautiful table decorations and the service was very warm and welcoming.Last but not least, the food! WOW!! delicious and they accommodated any dietary requirements. My friend Tom even went as far to say it was the best Indian food he has ever eaten.Thank you so much Aromas of India for a memorable night with my family that we will never forget
5
This place is my top favourite in Little India after trying a few other really good indian restaurants around.My very top favourites are:Palak Paneer - best out of all other placesChicken Tikka - nice smoky hot flavourGarlic Naan - very tasty and freshMango Lassy - perfectWhatever I have had here has always been fresh, delicious and just original indian.Well done guys
3
The naan is excellent
Palak Paneer is good too
Tandooi chicken a little too saltish but well marinated and tender
4
I would regularly need my Indian curry fix at least once a month. This restaurant is my go to Indian food place. Its vegetarian friendly and its typically quiet during lunch time so I would bring my work colleagues there for a good meal.
2
I used to like Aromas of India but I think they may have had a change in chef as the food isn't nearly as tasty as it used to be.
5
I stayed at the nearby Hilton garden inn and aromas of India became my local go to place for dinner. Love their gobhi Manchurian which is a plate of deep fried flowers of cauliflower tossed in a special spicy sauce. Also loved their kind of palak paneer simmered in tomato, ginger, garlic and chili. Great flavors. Quick and friendly service too. Very afgirdabl
3
Made a booking via Chope before heading out.Family were there before me.They were shown to table but were not attended to thereafter. Would have been nice if they had been asked if they would like a drink first (while waiting). After meal and juices, we had to ask 3 times before water was finally served.Was not like that during my previous visits.Hope they can improve on service
4
Surrounded by many other restaurants competition is fierce. Although it was the only empty place we decided to give it a chance and we were not disappointed. Very friendly staff who made us fel like home. Food was excellent and we would definitely recommend. Decor is A bit dated but do not be piu off
4
We tried this restaurant in June 2017 with my girlfriend. When we entered the scent from an.incense stick was a bit too disturbing. The food, however was quite nice. The chicken briyani is very tasty and the serving size is huge. The capsicum filled with masala and paneer is also very tasty. The lamb kebab is a bit dry, but the portion is also large. Altogether it's a nice place and if you use certain promotions (from third party) you can get a very good price for weekday dinner
3
Purchased the coupon on Grouoon/Fave and so now its time to try. Though it is mentioned in T&C to call and make appt so I called but guess what they said they are busy on the day I wanted so I had to go another day (usually this is not very common). On the specified day, I went to the restaurant and found there were only 3 family (3 tables) were there incuding us. Good was good but the service person was not responsive enough to serve the customers. I had to call to ask for water. Dal was less salty so I had to ask for salt too. Overall the other items were of good taste. You may feel the price is a bit on the higher side. But its up2u.
4
It's not often we go for Indian food while traveling out of India, open as we are to multiple cuisines. However as other chores brought us to Little India, we said why not try Indian cuisine & that too, North Indian or Punjabi style? We managed a table for six even at the last hour,thanks to the accommodative manager, as most Restaurants in Singapore claimed 'House Full' over the entire Mother's Day weekend! Once inside, we were welcomed with a broad smile & ready service. We opted for Vegetable Jal Frezi, Stuffed Capsicum, Bhindi, Yellow Dal, Raita and breads like Butter Nan, Stuffed Paratha & Garlic Nan. Every item was authentic in taste, the breads hot and service brisk. We couldn't help but notice that all other tables were taken by lots of locals & expats, all enjoying spicy Indian cuisine! Keep it up, Aromas of India. We will certainly come again

Was looking forward to meet up with a group of uni mates over dinner in little India restaurant, in this case, aromas of India recently. The interior was warm and furniture was like traditional indian counterpart home. Pappadon was nice. Naan with some vegetarian dishes was alright. Think was expecting more from the restaurant though. This is because personally felt it actually tasted like neighborhood coffeeshop standard. Can be better for restaurant standard. Staffs were helpful
4
and... The result was happiness, value, good service and a lovely manager called Sam who looked after out every need.
Rogan Josh the highlights.
See you again soon.
Thank you.
4
Very authentic Indian food. Good service. Samosa chart was epic. Definitely recommend! Quick journey from the little India tube.
5
We chose this place because trip advisor recommended it. The recommendations were correct. Good food excellent service all round excellent experience. Will certainly return as will our Son and Daughter in law will.
5
I have been here a few times since moving in the area. The food is consistently exciting and the stuff remains always friendly. Aside of sot down dinner you can order or take out too.
I strongly recommend a visit.
4
Aromas of India is a good place to enjoy tasty Indian food. We had a good time at the table outside, even if the terrasse is close to the road. We recommand!
5
We found this lovely spot while on a self tour of Little India in Singapore and it was our lucky day. The 2 for 1 Tiger beer was cold, and the naan perfectly cooked. Sam, the manger, was spot on with the recommendations of Butter Chicken and Lamb Ranganosh. Good thing we had to walk some more! We will be returning.
5
We are a repeat long time customer. We always take our other national friends to aromas for the Indian food. And all of them loved the food and it's the best in the whole street. Well done Sam for maintaining the good taste all these years! Cheers
5
We truly enjoyed our visit to this restaurant. The staff was extremely polite and efficient, and they really listened us regarding how spicy we like our dishes. The garlic naan was really delicious but a bit flat compared to what we are used to. The lamb vindaloo is to die for. We will definitely visit again
4
My wife and I visited this restaurant tonight for our first time. Overwhelming we were very impressed by the staff, very courteous and I reckon genuinely friendly. The young lady (whose name I've forgotten - sorry.. sinchet??) was pleasant ahd efficient, as was the maitre de.The food was good, we enjoyed it but to be honest it us Indian and common around little India but, we will return to this place because; the food was good but the staff were great!The restaurant is quite noisy, and seemed very family friendly so we enjoyed our dinner and experience
3
Visited once along with the family. Looks little overrated based on the number of reviews.. but is worth for money..Service is good and friendly..couple of dishes for e.g hyderabadi dum biryani should have been little more authentic.. though tasty looked more like a lucknow biryani.
5
Being in Little India you expect to have good Indian food but this small restaurant stands out above others I had tried there. The tandoori dishes are really good and vindaloo curry was excellent. Service was fast and friendly. Worth the visit.
5
This restaurant is a gem. Had samosas, chicken tikka massala, palak paneer, and naan. All were well spiced. The chicken tikka massala had a little charcoal and a little heat. It was awesome. Service was also excellent.
5
This place is by far the best restaurant for indian food in whole Singapore. Living her for 4 nearly years l never met a better place. Service is beyond excellent. Just a place to you to visit if you come to Little India!!!!
5
Nice testy food, good environment. Service is fast and friendly staff. Also near to mrt. It would be good if more vegiterian variance included.
5
Don't expect any great ambience but do expect fantastic food! This restaurant has a reputation for great North Indian food and a deserved one. We loved it and would go again. We did try and order a Kingfisher beer though (as it was listed on the menu) but the only beers they had were Tiger. I think they possibly need to put a bit more effort to ensure what they advertise they have in terms of drinks, that they really do have them! Anyway, hopefully their lack of attention to these details will be improved to match the quality of food they serve.
5
Aromas of India is a very nice restaurant on Race course road, the atmosphere is very calm and pleasant, the staff are always polite and helpful. The food is beautiful my favorite dish there is the Lamb Vindaloo with a side of garlic naan and a lovely cold beer to wash it all down with
4
Had a lovely family dinner including kids. Good value for money and enough left over to take home for another meal for all of us. Flavours were rich and service friendly. (One demerit only as result of floor and table in need of a good wash, but did not detract from meal itself.
4
Went here with a friend who found it online. It was very empty, which was nice. We had the paneer, tiki masala, and chicken briyani. Food came quickly and was delicious. Service was average, but all was good. Would recommend it as a good option in little India.
3
After all the reviews, i wanted to entertain my family for a dinner- hence selected and booked this place. We had approx 16 pax. The dhal makhni was good, butter chicken was good, naans and bread good, hyderabdhi biryani was good too! Dont get me wrong the food was good/ ok, i wouldnt rush to come back, the price was reasonable. The gulab jaman and chai was very good, but i couldnt understand all the reviews and praises like its food out of this world. I mean my preference still remains for Urban Roti or Petro's Sports Bar in East Coast. I find their Indian food very good! In fact, besides rang mahal, which is on the high end, urban roti with be my next best option. Still if your on a budget and not fussed about quality and want the little india experience, then go for it
4
My wife and I had a very nice dinner--our second time there for dinner. The value of the food is exellent and it is delicious. The service is very good--and the food is served fast.We had three dishes--chicken tikka masala, veggie dish, and dahl makni. All was quite tasty. The dahl was some of the best we have every had. We also had rice and garlic naan. Both were great.We recommend this place if you want a nice, low-key dinner that is well priced
5
Great value dinner that doesn't skimp on taste. Staff was extremely friendly and courteous. Here's a situation where your body is telling you to stop but your mouth and tongue just wants more. Would highly recommend to anyone in search of tasty Indian cuisine.
5
Yesterday had dinner at Aromas of India with my son and wife. Had some drinks and butter chicken, cheese naan, really awesome. Excellent service, place to visit again n again.
5
If you are looking for authentic Indian food in Singapore, Aromas of India is the place to be. Great food, lovely ambiance, and excellent service. Murg tikka badami is a must try !!! Butter chicken and naan is great take away combo

Excellent service provided by the staff.
Very cooperative staff and excellent management.
4
Good Indian food, the service is a bit slow. The day I went, on a weekday, not many people in there.
Overall, an OK experience.
3
This is a restaurant for great food on racecourse road in Singapore. The Dahl makni is excellent. It is reasonably priced but unfortunately the service on the night we went for dinner was very poor. They seemed to be doing a great take away business and ignoring the diners in the restaurant.
5
A place where we dine in often. Foods are awesome and they accomodate to customers taste bud. Something that not every restaurant will accomodate for their customers.Food taste is always very consistent to no diff and everything is freshly done and served.No complaints at all
5

Aromas of india is very very nice restaurant in Singapore, for the past 5years we are going with our friends almost twice or thrice a week, Mr. Sam, the manager in Aromas is a person who knows how to treat their guest very well organised and friendly. Trust me, very friendly atmosphere and food is very tasty. Good luck to Aromas
5
Aromas of india, is one of the finest restaurant in SG, where we can enjoy good food and drinks, apart from this we can enjoy good ambience and friendly environment with good service.

The staff were happy and enjoyed chatting with us all. I can honestly say if you want a good authentic Indian meal in a great atmosphere this is the place to go!

5
Home away from home. If you are new/ visiting SG, you will never feel away from India.Like the name suggests; this place has excellent food and a top notch service especially by Sam who focuses and takes care of each of the customer.Such service level makes me choose this place every fortnight. A must try
4
We chose Aromas of India for our first try at Indian food... and we are so happy of our choice!Food here is lovely and when the waiter learnt we had never had Indian food before we started worrying about the level of spiciness so he kept on coming to us asking if we were enjoying or if we needed water :)We really enjoyed the experience.The restaurant is verypleasantly quiet, with some TV screens broadcasting Indian dance music.The bathroom is very clean and they have wifi.Try the butter chicken.... the best!They also offer take away and delivery service
4
Me and my husband went on a weekday afternoon. The place was therefore quite empty. The food was very much to our liking. We had the lamb sheek kebabs as appetisers and they were moist and quite tasty. It was followed by dal makhani, jeera rice and chicken papper, which they will prepare as to your wish of spiciness. We loved the food. The quantity was more than enough for the both of us. We ended our meal with a sweet lassi, which could be improved upon.Will surely visit again!!
4
Nice and cosy Indian Restaurant conveniently located near Little India MRT Station, serving great food, our party of three have chicken 65, paneer butter masala, lamb rugan josh (so tender and juicy) and Hyderabadi chicken briyani. Also, Mr Sam will serve you and ensure that all of you have great Indian food and service. Many thanks to both Mr Sam and Aromas of India (my sixth times there in 2016 with more to come!

So I did a delivery from this restaurant and the minute I went to my room to eat I realised there was no spoons or fork - I did a delivery to a hotel room so obviously I won't have cutlery in my room. Nonetheless, let that issue rest. I ordered tandoori prawns, samosa and Lamb Briyani. The tandoori prawns were a whooping $19 and there were just 4 pieces in it, the serving size is really bad for the price. The taste was very mild as if you just threw masalas on it and not actually marinated it. The lamb briyani was good, the lamb was very tender and tasted good as well, the briyani rice seemed not well mixed, some parts you can see lumps of white rice but still good enough and taste was up to expectation. Avoid the samosa, for $3, I got one of the worst samosas in my life, the stuffed potatoes smelled bad and the masala was not of an authentic samosa. Overall, the food is pretty average (Except the briyani, that was a good 4/5) and I give it a 3. I got my delivery done by ubereats and my food arrived in about 20 mins which was really fast
4
We had gone there for lunch as a family and were very happy with the food served as it was very tasty and fresh. However, the chefs and waiters were also having their food sitting on the table bring ours but it is a bit expensive
1
We ate dinner at the aromas of india. We ordered lucknawi biriyani,butter chicken and lassi. Biriyani did not have its aroma it tasted like normal tomato rice. Butter chicken could be alot better. I do not recommend this place. It is very suspicious how they were rated high
5
We have been back to this place time and time again. The service is always with a smile and the food is really great (and we know our curry...)
4
Excellent Indian food! Love the food. Usually get a home delivery. Reminds me of dhaba food from India. Love their chana masala, mattar paneer and kulchas.
3
Good Indian food - North Indian.. Rotis, naans, biryanis - reasonably priced and good portions. Good service.
4
Great food. Would recommend the lamb vindalo. Decent quality meat, reasonable portions at a pretty fair price. I usually ask for delivery and it takes around 30-40 minutes. Pretty good by Singapore standards
5
Great food, small quiet and intimate atmosphere with excellent service. Try the chicken tikka, great flavor and texture. Also try the prawn sambal
1
There was more hair in my food than hair on my head. Just simply unacceptable. Avoid unless you want a little extra protein with your chicken tikka.
4
We ate in this restaurant purely because of all of the trip advisor sticker on the door! We had originally walked into and then very quickly out of another restaurant just alone the road. The service was good, we ordered our food, me being veggie asked for a recommendation, I had a saag paneer and saffron rice.. Delicious! Dickie had a fish masala which he said was really good. We had more than enough to eat and it was really tasty!
3
Anthony gave us great service by asking us we would like to eat and helped us narrow down the dishes. We ordered the tandoori chicken, marsala prawns n spinach. The chicken was good but frozen prawns were likely used for our dish. Was disappointed that they used frozen prawns.
5
This place is tucked between all those Indian restaurants on racecourse road but for me it's the best there. After trying some of the places to me this is outstanding. The service is really good and the food is exceptional. Packed with flavor and meat in the masala. Definitely worth a visit
1
Visited for Weekend Lunch with family. We order Naan, Briyani, lime juice. Chease Naan come with surprise that square Cheas on top of it, never seen it before.Briyani rice was half cooked with plenty of Masala. Ultimate one was Lime Juice, it is mix of lime concentrate + water + sugar + ice cubes. Guys, you have to stir hardly to mix sugar with waters. it cost $2.90It was very very bad food quality experienced in Little India area. The price is not match with food quality
1
They need to sort their voucher policy out. It's not clear, they lead people to think they have bookings, they then turn them away at the door. Beware of this restaurant.
4
Not much to look at when you first enter, but friendly staff and fantastic food made for a great evening
5
We go to this street every year & always try a new restaurant, this one did not disappoint. The staff were good, the service pretty quick & the meal just delicious.
5
We have been there triggered by the good tripadvisor ranking, and we haven't been disappointed. The taste of the food is excellent and not to hot.
If you give it a try, go for the chili chicken starter!
5
If you're looking for a great curry in Little India then look no further. DÃ©cor is simple but clean and with ample space between tables. Service was prompt and the server could describe the dishes on the menu easily enough, even ordering dishes from off the menu wasn't a problem. As a table of two we ordered 1 starter, 2 curries, 1 rice, a vegetable side, and 2 lots of bread which not being huge eaters was just the right amount. The food was unbelievably good. Curries with the right texture and spice, the lamb beautifully tender and the bread wasn't too greasy. Price wise we were amazed at how good the value was, just goes to show that Singapore doesn't have to be expensive
5
My wife and I went for a big lunch on a weekday. We cannot find good Indian food where we live, so we ordered a good sampling here. I ordered the Lamb Rugan Josh and she ordered the Murgh Tikka Badami. We ordered the Vegetable Samosa and Palak Pakora for starters, along with some garlic naan and cheese naan and rice.Our waiter was Sam, and he was very attentive. He helped us with our selections, and was very happy to help describe some of the less familiar items. The Palak Pakora was terrific- crunchy and chewy battered spinach. The Vegetable Samosa was also very tasty. Our main entrees arrived shortly thereafter. Servings where large and looked delicious. The Rugan Josh was very flavorful and not too spicy. The lamb was very tender and moist. I tried my wife's Murgh Tikka Badami, which is chicken with cream and cheese cooked in a tandoori. Wonderful. Great flavor. Moist and creamy. The cheese and garlic naans were fantastic. The cheese was my favorite. The garlic was very good too, with plenty of garlic flavor. Sam, our young gentleman waiter, was very gracious and helpful. I was very thirsty, and he never let my water glass stay empty. Being tourists, we asked him about his city, and the conversation was very warm and engaging. He gave us some very helpful and interesting viewpoints from a local perspective. He made our visit to Aromas very enjoyable!Don't forget to try the Kulfi. It is an Indian ice cream- very rich, creamy and smooth with incredible and delicate floral notes!I am stuffed again, just recalling this wonderful meal

Dear Sir / Madam,I'd like to formally lodge a complaint against Aromas of India.I went to the restaurant personally on 21 October to make a booking for 16 pax for 31 October, 6.30pm. I called again on 22 October to re-confirm the reservation, and the table arrangement. Everything was confirmed.Today, 23 October, someone called to re-confirm the reservation and the table arrangement. Until finally, I told the staff that I'll be using voucher, the staff immediately said no voucher allowed for dinner on Friday and Saturday. This is contrary to what is stated on the voucher. When I rebutted, he immediately changed his statement and said that booking is full. Didn't we already make 2 confirmations prior to this?I am deeply disappointed with them. They did not honor their word, nor did they honor the voucher.If Ensogo condones such behavior from errant retailers like Aromas of India, I'm afraid that it is not in the best interest of fair trade. I'll also shun Ensogo in the future.The restaurant screw up all our plans, and now we need to look for alternative solution. Please refund all vouchers
5
Came here for my mum's birthday after reading the reviews here. Very very pleased with the experience, the service and most importantly the food. It's absolutely spot-on in terms of taste, texture and balance and the service is attentive without being intrusive. Can't recommend it enough

Firstly would like to compliment on the waiter who took our orders and described the food patiently to us as we could not really get the picture of how the food is cooked..don't know his name though but it was lunch on the 3/10/2015..Every food ordered was served without delay and was so tasty. Affordable, Great Ambience, Great location next to banana leaf behind Little India MRT..A must try..

We were a family of 7 and decided to head down to Aromas of India for lunch. The ambiance was very nice and soothing. Mr.Singh (Manager) warmly welcomed us in and set us a table and gave us papadams and mint chutney. The chutney tasted great by the way, a yogurty sauce with a tinge of mint. We ordered Gobi Manchurian for starters, it was so crispy and had a superb blend of sweet & sour taste. For the main we had Chicken Tandoori, Fish Tikka, Paneer Butter Masala, Bindi Masala, Jeera Rice and Naans.All the dishes surpassed our expectations, there were all really good and tasty. I highly recommend them to anyone who wishes to have good North Indian food at a very reasonable price in Singapore

A group of us have a curry night once every few months and always try somewhere different. This was a standout venue: very good food, different menu options, great service, and didn't break the bank. Recommended.
3
The flavor is OK. Actually, it's kindly healthier than some other indian restaurants what I have tried. Not oily, not too salty. But the price is a bit more expensive than other restaurants which can offer the similar quality food.
4
Quality of food is excellent, not blotted the tummy. Restaurant manager Mr Singh is amazing!Good hospitality!
5
Been in Southeast Asia for about two weeks now, and this is easily the best Indian food we've had. Paneer tikka, stuffed bell peppers, and fried cauliflower. All flavorful and complex. Would highly recommend!
5
Visited after long time. My children love this place. Great Indian food at affordable prices. Nice cozy place.
5
We recently visited Aromas of India, and was a great experience, food was 9/10, ambience and service 8/10 and value for money 10/10.
I would highly recommend palak pakora and masala bhindi
Looking forward for the next trip

As an accomplished Indian hot curry consumer, and having tried many popular and some less popular restaurants in Singapore in search of a hot curry that hits the spot, I can confidently say that Aromas consistently serves up curry customised to your heat tolerance, whilst retaining all the spice flavours you want from Indian food.The naan bread is cooked perfectly, not too thick, and with a crispy base, ideal for dipping and eating with sauce dishes.The service is friendly, there's a non rushed atmosphere ideal for business and with family and friendsAfter 3 years eating here, there's nowhere to compare
5
Saw this on Tripadvisor so me and my boyfriend tried this place for the first time. We thought it would be crowded but surprisingly we were the only customers they had on that night. Made the night more romantic. The food was pretty good and the service was fast. Ordered chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala and cheese naan. Wow, the best Indian meal we've ever had. Forget about those cheap Indian set meals on the street and go for this one with better value and exceptional food experience
4
I saw this place had one of the best reviews for an Indian restaurant in Little India so took the family there for our first meal on arrival in Singapore. I expected it to be crowded but there were only two other groups eating. This resulted in a very pleasant and relaxed meal. Both the food and service was very good
5
We visited Aromas of India for the first time on Saturday. The restaurant was full, but the food and service was first class. The samosas were superb, the butter paneer beautiful and the chicken jalfrezi top-notch. The main man, Sam, is an absolute star and gave us a complimentary lamb vindaloo once he knew I liked spicy dishes. And it was spectacular. If you are looking for fantastic food served with a smile, you need to go here. We will be going back soon for sure
5
The food is simply amazing. This is a place that I would definitely recommend to everyone!
The staff is very nice and friendly as well.
4
My wife and i were looking for a more authentic Indian so decided to try Aromas of India, the food was of good quality though we found it not spicy enough, but two courses, a glass of wine, two beers for 85 dollars good value.
5
one of the gud indian restaurants in singapore for indian cuisine...excellent service...was very quick ...
gentleman went out of the way to helpus call a taxi....appreciate his efforts
would definitely recommend n revisit
5
Very homely ambience, Excellent hospitality and tasty food. Mr. Sam (the manager) always welcomes us with warm smile .This perfect combination of a good restuarant is a bever to missplace. Their tandoori and chinese fusion are THE BEST in Singapore. My son loves Malai Chicken tikka her
5
Don't be afraid when you walk in & there is no body sitting there...We dined with some indian people apart of our group, & they said it was some of the best quality they had even had.Big extensive menu...food of the upmost quality...a great dinner in a town with some many restaurant
4
Amongst a lot of other choices in the area, this one stood out from previous reviews. Providing excellent, authentic Indian food served with a friendly smile. A favourite was the garlic naan and the butter paneer was as good as any I have had in India. Highly recommended
4
Excellent service and so much food! Definitely go to in Little India if you're after attentive service, airconditioning, good prices, and so much food you'll need a cart to roll you back to your hotel.Easy to get to- take the train to little India, alight and walk to the right down the main road
5
Loved this place. Had the Lamb Vindaloo (super tender and spicy), garlic naan, raita and a couple of Kingfisher beers. Great, attentive service, prompt, hot and tasty food, cannot fault it. Thank you so much !!!!! I will be back next time I am in Singapore :
4
We stopped in for lunch today. The butter chicken and saag chicken were delicious, and we also enjoyed the garlic naan and the cheese naan. Service was fast and courteous, and the price seemed reasonable. We are not Indian food aficionados and three of the five of us found the food very spicy, but for Indian food lovers, I'm sure it would be perfect.
4
A strong chicken tikka masala and good palak paneer. These are my usual dishes and Aromas has very good versions. I would certainly return to this location again, even though it's among a long line of Indian restaurants in Little India in Singapore. The restaurant had a good menu but I was unfortunately unable to try additional items
4
Restaurant catering traditional Indian food. Food is tasty, however waiting time is too long. we can see the struggling staff due to insufficient manpower.
4
Really good food. The chicken tikka masala is a must try and the garlic naan was also super nice. However the restaurant was a bit cold and the furnitures and atmosphere in the restaurant was a bit dull. Otherwise it would have been a 5.
5
Hello,
I was here for a weekend lunch and the staff were courteous and kind. The food was tasty and well presented. I will definitely go again! And also delivery was on time last night . Thank you for a great dining experience.
2
Nice service but the food was very disappointing. Chicken tikka was partly raw and the quality of the chicken wasn't good also. The main bread was good and the price was very good
4
We had a nice meal in Aromas of India. We had the Hyderabadi Chicken Briyani, a garlic naan and their Paneer Butter Masala. The food was tasty and the service was swift and friendly (thanks you Anthony). The briyani could have been more spicy (as we asked for this) but all in all it was a very good meal. The place itself is strategic, about two minutes by foot from the little india mrt station. The place is also fairly priced given that we're talking about Singapore. We would definitely go again if we move to Singapore
5
Stopped here for lunch while on the hop on hop off bus. The service was excellent and the food was even better. We had 2 entrees, samosas, naan, and 3 drinks and the total bill was $45S. The food was hot and was so, so good. Plus, they were playing some pretty amazing Indian music videos while we were there that looked like they were from the 90s
3
The food was absolutely excellent! We never had such a tasty indian food before. - BUT after one hour i had the flu. This is the reson, why the restaurant loses one point.The owner is very nice. After the starter he asked us, if we could give him a recommendation on tripadvisor. This is the reason, why I subtract another point.If I haven't had the flu, i would definitely come back. Sorry for that
5
Service: If i call to call for home delivery, they immediately recognize my address by my name. So, imagine how many times i must have ordered from this restaurant. they are very adjusting and willing to delivery the order without demanding for minimum order (They use to come for just 2 rotis and a curry, well we were living close by)Food: must try tandoori: one of very few restaurants in Singapore i FELT the tandoori is fresh and nice consistently. Biryani is another dish should try.Overall, very friendly staff and delicious food
4
We happened to pass by Aromas of India and decided to pop in for dinner. The place was clean and nicely decorated, with a nice ambiance. We ordered a few dishes and drinks including Garlic Naan, Tandoori Roti, Palak Paneer, Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka, Ginger Lassi and Mango Lassi. The food was served hot and tasted pretty good. The prices of the dishes were reasonable as well. Overall a pleasant experience
5
We ordered take out from Aroma's of India via a food runner company and were not disappointed at all. We had Butter Chicken and Rogan Josh and Garlic Naan and can't fault any of the dishes. All were beautifully cooked and flavorsome. The meals were quite spicy which we love but if you don't like your curries too hot I would ask them for a mild one. It took a long time for our order to be delivered but unsure if this was due to the restaurant or the food runners however it was worth the wait and we would definitely order from here again
4
Casual dining, with friendly staff and really good flavors. Recommend this place for fantastic Indian food.
4
Great taste for and value for money
Nice variety of Indian cuisine
The owner is very friendly and cooperative
Would suggest to have a visit to this place
5
Everything good about this place. Good taste..Good ambience.. Good service & staff.. And not heavy on pocket at all.
What else Indiawaale need - Truly the taste of India!
1
its a terrible experience. .. dont believe the don't go with this rating..don't go with tripadvisor rating.. food is waste.. no fresh chicken.. please avoid this restaurant.............................
5
Little India has an array of authentic and not so authentic Indian restaurants but we found the Aromas of India to be a very good choice. Although not as big as some of the other restaurants in the area it was definitely less touristy and more authentic. The Lamb Tikka was the best we have ever had and the samosaâ€™s could hold their own with any Indian restaurant. Very attentive staff and a reasonable price for fine quality food
2
We happened to be lazy and wanted to have some spicy indian food and found Aromas of india online on food panda and called them, they where happy to deliver food home if it was ordered for about 40$ and we did, asked the person on the phone about which curry is good in their restaurant and he mentioned a chicken curry which I ordered along with 2 other dishes, food was delivered within 45 mins which was good but nothing tasted good starter was ok but the chicken was too hard and not fresh and for the price they charge the quantity was very very less hardly good enough for 1 person, currys where not tasty at all half of the small box was filled with oil on the top, the curry he recommended dint have any taste and had chicken with full of bones and nothing else, very very oily and very little quantity for starters and currys not worth a home delivery. Would mever recommend this restaurant for home delivery have not been to the restaurant in person so can not comment on that bit and I dont intend to dine in too after this experience.Strange to see lot of positive reviews on TripAdvisor after which I ordered but really had a bad experienc
4
Nice atmosphere--quiet and cool with dark, soothing decor. The service was attentive and helpful. I was there with a friend on a Wednesday night, so they weren't busy at all. We started with Vegetable Samosas and Ghobi Manchurian (spiced, deep-fried caulifower). The first was just okay, but the cauliflower was excellent. For our main courses, we both chose lamb (Vindaloo and Rugan Josh). Both of these dishes were excellent, though I'd pick the Vindaloo because the spices were superb. the lamb in each case was lean and cooked to falling apart--very good. We added Garlic Naan and steamed rice. the Naan was a good as I've had anywhere. My only complaint would be that they were a little pricey for the area, with beer costing way too much, too, but then this IS Singapore
5
When you are in an area accustomed to tourists, it can be very tricky to get the best dining experience representative of the area, as there is so much competition. We luckily at a random choice, decided to dine in Aromas, and it was definitely not regretted. The food was absolutely delicious, and the host of the evening (I believe his name was Sam) was welcoming, talkative and made our visit to Little India an absolute delight. If you want the best out of Little India, I would not hesitate to recommend Aromas of India to any resident, tourist or visitor. Both my partner and I are from Australia, but are of Indian decent, so we know what the benchmark is to make a great curry at the best value of money. Another thanks to our new friend we made in Aromas - Warm regards, Adam & Krishna
3
I went here for a late night meal it was ok food everything else was also just ok, I eat a lot of Indian food so I am well versed in different styles of the Indian foods. To be fair I would go back but the chap serving us could hardly speak English so that didn't help as he could not understand our order, overall not the best but at the end of the day not the worst.
5
We just had an excellent meal at aromas of India. The chicken tikka masala was delicious and the paneer pakor was a perfect starter. The garlic naan is really delicious too. We happened to try the lonely planet-recommended banana leaf apolo first. Food at the banana leaf Apolo was acceptable, but really underwhelming compared to aromas of India. Skip banana leaf apolo and go to aromas directly!Big thanks to Sam, the Aromas of India manager, for making our dinner really special
5
A must visit to quench his/her thirst. Awesome place for dine and wine.good ambience and affordable place.most noted is friendly staff.

I ventured to try Aromas of India after I tried going to Kashmir only to discover that it has closed (permanently). I whipped out my phone, looked into Tripadvisor to find a good Indian restaurant in the same area that is ranked well.The portions are good, I could not finish what was given, which is a sign that they do not stint on portions. Butter chicken, my standard order, was rich and robust. Alcohol prices are not as good as Kashmir so I decided not order beer, which is a dismay as beer goes well to every Indian meal. This is just something I have to come to terms with, as long as I live in Singapore. I ordered mango lassi instead. It was a good choice except that the waiter forgot that I had ordered. I reminded him by inquiring about my order, he didn't say a word, and just went the other way, the service here is rather strange, and he returned with my drink about five minutes later with a guilty look on his face.I will put up with the strange (and non-existent) service here. The Indian food is of good quality, the portions are acceptable and the prices are reasonable. The two of us spent $40 ($20 each) on lunch (basmati rice with three dishes of good serving size), and one of us had a non-alcoholic beverage
5
The food was delicious but the service was even better! The manager is incredibly friendly and smiley, and the staff is very attentive. The restaurant is clean and nice, overall a very pleasant atmosphere. Chicken tikka masala was delicious, as well as the garlic naan. The mint sauce was fabulous. I was pleased that they served complimentary water (the server always kept my glass full), and were generous with their portion sizes.
2
Usually we go to Jaggi's but as it was packed on that night decided to try the Aromas of India, it took them more than 10 mins for someone to attend our table (we had to grab the menu ourselves form another empty table), we were about to leave the restaurant as inspite of repeated raising hands and calling the staff never grabbed their attention, but suddenly one staff appeared and took the orders, I had even asked if it will take long time to serve food, but he said it will be served fast, we waited another 30mins for some part of order to arrive, the food was average nothing exceptional except the price which was bit higher than other restaurants around. We had to call the staff several times and wait to even replenish water in our glassesRestaurant was quite and clean but severely understaffed.You can skip this restaurant if you are hungry or in a hurry
4
Had a lovely Sunday evening meal at aromas of India. The staff are very friendly and the service is excellent.The restaurant has a nice feel to it and the food is delicious.Thanks
3
Based on good reviews in Tripadvisor I went here to have dinner, this restaurant is below my expectation.Ambiance is good. Clean and Nice place. Service takes long. If you go on a week end for a dinner prepared to wait for a while.The disappointing aspect is the taste of the food. One of the item that we ordered had too much salt, another was too bland. Overall we were not happy with food taste. In a restaurant the food taste is important too
5
We are no experts for indian food but there we liked it a lot. The service was good, especially the very nice owner - and the price was low (15-20 S$ main dish + drink). The food was very good and well siced, we also got 3 small dishes for free to taste other indian meals! Therefore we recommend it to erverybody who wants to eat something in little india
5
By far the best restaurant in Little India. Very friendly staff and excellent food. Really good value for money too. We have been 7-8 times and have never been disappointed
5
Stopped in here for a quick bite during lunch time. The place was empty but whatever. (There are like 400 Indian restaurants on this street and this was the highest rated..so we went and it was 11am) We sat down, watched Indian music videos on the tv, and the waiter brought us waters along with some thin, almost like a chip, but made of bread things and this green sauce. First of all the green sauce with the yogurt, mint, and spices I would have drank a glass of it, IT WAS SO GOOD! I couldn't stop dipping! I kept saying this is my last one but it wasn't! I ordered the chicken tikka masala, my boyfriend the tandoori chicken, along with cheese naan and the rice with the peas and spices. The masala sauce was awesome with just the right amount of kick. The chicken was tender and delicious. It had 4 decent sized pieces of chicken in the masala sauce. I had the drumstick (boyfriend doesn't like dark meat) tandoori and it was fall off the bone moist and so good! I couldn't get enough of the masala sauce and kept dipping my naan in it and pouring it over my rice. I also had a mango lassie to drink, which was thick and tasty! I was sad when the meal came to an end!

This review is done by a Vegetarian, hence we had no idea what the Non Negetarian food is like.The place is nice and decent and was not so full when we visited even on a Friday 8pm dinner time. The crown already there was just everyday people and did not seems like tourists which we saw in race course road in other Curry Resturants.Anyways we ordered Paneer Butter Masala (below average), Veg Jhalfrezi (below average) and both were with tomoato /onion gravy and Yellow Dal (decent). The bread we ordered were just ok. Overall food was not so spicy and not greasy, so people who do not want Paneer Butter Masala to e greasy maybe they can try out here :-)Averag place with lovely Gulab Jamun (Dessert). The pricing of the resturant is very reasonable as well as meal for 2 costed us around $40 which is without Dessert and Drinks. So it should come to approx $30 per hea

Aromas of India - Superb Indian Food.For some years I have been patronizing Kashmir Restaurant a few doors away and was surprised to find it had shut shop :(. Having arranged dinner with a colleague who was just about to arrive I hastily went up and down the strip of restaurants looking at menus and seating comfort. Decided on Aromas of India.With hindsight I congratulate myself on the choice. Beautiful fresh smell in the restaurant. When we arrived it was not so busy n waiting staff were keen to help us with our selection. Had fish tika n chicken tika between two us. Fish was succulent - excellent and the chicken equally good. For mains we ordered masala eggs - don't always see eggs on menu so I was delighted to see it - tasted excellent to. We had lamb rogan josh and a veggie side dish. Service impeccable - excellent meal.Good selection of wines and beer.Prices quite reasonable!Would return anytime - a great place
5
I enjoyed everything about this restaurant--the quality of the food, options on the menu and service. Don't be thrown off if the restaurant is more than half empty. There are just so many options for Indian food in Little India, it must be hard to consistently generate a crowd. There were only two other tables full during my visit, but both parties were locals. Everything my table ordered for lunch was very good. The waiters were also good about giving recommendations about what dishes might suit our tastes. Service was excellent
3
Top 20 restaurant on TA, only 1 table occupied. Thought went into the wrong restaurant because the signboard has changed. Don't look like the old logo. Wonder how they sustain the business. Banana leaf next door is full packed.Service was top notch. Food was average. Lamb kebab was great. The rest of the curry very mild. Loving fish curry. They do serve basmati rice here. No kick at all. Lots of the Indian restaurants in Asia don't use basmati rice.Do serve wine and beer here. Fantastic! Had a bottle of Australian red. Packaging for Indonesian market.Next table bought food from banana leaf next door consumed in the restaurant. Apparently is alright
5
I went to this place after seeing so many positive reviews and it really stood upto the expectation. We ordered vegetarian food and it was really tasty and hot. Other than that the person who was serving had smile on his face and made us feel at home. It was a wonderful experience
4
We walked in without a reservation for lunch and were seated right away. I was a bit concerned as the reviews were great but there was only one other couple in the restaurant. First impressions aside, the food was great! Indian food is so complex but so simple and we enjoy it every time we have it Aromas of India was a great meal for a great price
4
I've just been to Aromas of India after reading many positive comments and evaluations on Tripadvisor.The place was almost empty, but the waiter was very friendly with us.We tried samosas and fried cayflowers, butter chicken and grilled prawns, and everything was really good.The price is slightly high compared to the other restaurants in the aria, maybe that's why not many people were there. I suggest this place if you don't mind spending an higher budget compared to a standard Indian restaurant
5
What a little hidden gem in Racecourse Road .Stopped off here on Sunday afternoon with my husband for food after shopping in Little India .On arrival we were immediately greeted by friendly helpful staff who turned ac temperature down as we were very hot and fetched us some water .Food was amazing and arrived shortly after ordering and sent our tastebuds into overdrive.Chilli mushrooms and palak pakora for starter were divine .Fish curry and mix vegetable curry to follow was amazing .The food just got better and better even took some home as a takeaway would highly recommend eating here and will certainly be back .First class service and food well done Aromas of India 
3
After reading all of the favorable reviews on Tripadvisor, my partner and I were excited about our visit to Aromas. When we arrived, we were surprised to see the restaurant was almost empty (there were only two other customers). We each ordered a garlic naan and a curry, and were offered poppadoms to start. While our waiter was very friendly and attentive, the food was quite bland and unremarkable. The veggies in my Aloo Ghobi were overcooked, and the naan was lacking flavor, even though it was served with extra garlic and butter. My partner loves spicy food, but his Chicken Vindaloo was effectively a Chicken Tikka Massala with a little extra curry powder. Overall, improvements are needed to bring the quality of food in line with the great service
3
I read the reviews from Trip Advisor to eat here.The place was empty (even though I had got there at almost 2 p.m.) it filled up a bit later onThe food was definitely freshly cooked - I had a chicken tandoori starter which was moist and tender. The main of lamb curry also, naan and rice was also all freshProblem was that all the food was bland. I had to ask for chilies to scatter over the food.Nice and hospitable waiter but disappointing foo
5
I found this restaurant on a Local Singapore website and was not disappointed. It is so not the usual decor, but the service and food was fabulous. My 14yr nephew also enjoyed all his food, and he is a fussy eater!! My two local friends also said they would be back. Unfortunately I would love to go back, just a bit to far to travel for a meal out. I would recommend this to any body who loves their food but not worried about the surroundings. I would also like to add that it was my cheapest meal in Singapore, especially for my glass to two of wine!
5
Always visit this restaurant weekly.Excellent food and friendly staff.Nice ambience as well.Way to go,Aromas of India!!
5
We visited this restaurant after reading positive reviews and they are definitely right. We ordered samosas and pakora for entrees and butter chicken and lamb rogan josh. All food was fresh and very nice. Prices reasonable. Owner ordered cab for us and waited on street with us to check we were okay. Great night out. Highly recommended
3
I would not say food is bad. But, nothing special. Food tastes average. Some of the items were below average. We had fish biryani which was not so good. In biryani, even rice has to be coated with masala not just meat or egg in it. It was just colored rice with fish fitters. So, less then average for biryani. Butter chicken was oki but, average. Naan and kulchas were good.We also had home delivery from them. And, except tandoori prawns everything was below average. Price is reasonable though. Good staff. Clean ambiance
5
Like this place (little India branch) The food quality is good, and the prices are reasonable! Everyone enjoyed the place.. Strikingly good was the service that we enjoyed.. The waiter was courteous, and always greeted us with a smile! He was attentive to our needs, and was definitely enjoyed being there...Recommend this place
4
Went to this place for the first time after trying quiet a few other restos in the buffalo road lined up along little india. Must say - the food is really good and the service is upto the mark. The ambience is well set. Two televisions sets at either end of the resto gives a nice touch.Tried Jeera rice, Dal Makhani, Chicken Papper , Palak Pakoda's with some naan and kulcha's - all great taste and texture.Not very heavy on the stomach , and good quantity. Recommended

Discovered this place via TripAdvisor, surprisingly its right next door to the apollo banana leaf restaurant which i have visited on numerous occaions but somehow consistently overlooked it's smaller and much humbler neighboor. Despite such a formidable competition next door there were planty of guests at this place, mostly Indian families which tells a story.From the minute we walked in, the service was surperb. The evening started with complimentary poppadoms and a free (!) mango lassy for my gf. We then ordered Gobi Manchurian which was very aromatic and crispy albeit a little greasy (thats the nature of the dish of course). We followed up by ordering: Palak Paneer - smooth, subtle flavours, with mild spices lurking in the background. Very good.Dal Makhani - a Must Try (even says so on the menu), creamy with beautiful rich flavour of brown lentils and spices.Stuffed Capsicum Masala - we disagreed on this one with my gf. Its quite rich and creamy and with cashew nut based sauce. I guess this dish was overshowed by the other more complex plates of food we were having.Garlic Naan - good. Jeera rice - good.Service: through out the evening the service was commendable. Great attention to detail. Unfortunately, a rarity in Singapore where good levels of service are hard to come by
5
The best Indian food i ever had. When they didnt have the beer i wanted I got 2 indian brand beers for free. I have nothing to complain about
4
Its a lovely place, humble and polite staff, soft music and freshly made deliciously mouth watering food. Before the plate comes to the table the aroma reaches you. Its a must visit restaurant . A small package that can offer the aromas of India away from India
4
Sam is one of the best servers I have had in Singapore. Very warm and accommodating, with great recommendations for my wife and me.The food here is excellent and reasonably priced. We paid $85 (incl. tax and service) for 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes, 2 naan, saffron rice, 4 beers, and a dessert. Without drinks and dessert it would have been less than $50
5
We've eaten here tonight and after doing my research on trip advisor I wasn't disappointed, at first there was only myself and my husband in but the owner made us feel very welcome, the papadoms were lovely and fresh, the starters were fantastic and mains of sizzler lamb and a vegetable curry were also cooked to perfection, I have to say I can be very particular where we eat but was really taken with this little gem!
5
Fantastic food. Generous servings. Great service and friendly vibe. Very satisfying....even booked us a taxi
5
I love this place, the service is always great and the food is flavourful and delicious. The great authentic Indian Cuisine, must visit as it respect Indian Cultural Culinary Heritage
5
We are a regular guest to Aromas of India since the time they started. Whenever we feel like eating Indian we think only of Aromas of India for a simple reason that their food is value for money. We get heartburns or indigestion when we eat food that has MSG. But with Aromas we did not have any stomach upsets as Aromas use very less oil n Sam said they dont use MSG at all in their food.They serve very tasty, healthy food for a very reasonable price. Above all Sam is a very friendly person he receives every customers just like we receive our guests at home. Thank you Sa
5
we really appreciated our visits at this place and so did our friends. carefully prepared and very tasty dishes. And Sam is a lovely person who makes you feel like at a friends place. we will definately be back again
5
It is one of the best North-Indian restaurants in Singapore. As the name suggests, the food is more flavorful and tasty rather than just being spicy like many other Indian restaurants.We used to live right across the road from Aromas of India when we moved to Singapore and we literally ate there at least twice a week ! Despite eating there so frequently over the past four years, we've never tired of the food. To top off the great food, the service is excellent. The staff are really friendly, notably Tarsem.If you're in Singapore, do visit little India and check out this place on Race course road
5
We went to Aromas of India late on a Saturday night and got great food and excellent service, despite it being late. Nothing was a problem and the servcie was prompt and efficient.The Chicken Saag and Rogan Josh were excellent, in fact both were amongst the best we have had.This restaurant is good value and an enjoyable experience watching the world go by on Racecourse Road, we can't recommend it more
5
I have been consistently going to 'Aromas of India' for the past two years, from delivering on a friday night to going there mid-week. In my opinion, it is by far the Best indian restaurant in singapore, because of its quality service, good value for money and the excellence of the food. This is a must try, and I advise you to go here and not splash out on a overpriced restaurant such as 'Song Of India'
5
"Aromas" as I fondly call the place has been my go-to place for Indian food in Singapore for 3 years now. Absolutely love the personalised service by Tarsem Singh and ofcourse the delicious food. I end up ordering for home delivery on most weekends (home delivery is free by the way) and have never got a chance to criticize either the service or the food. A definite must go place if you have not been there!- De
5
I have been to many Indian restaurants in Singapore but i found Aromas as one of the best of them as its food got value of money ......i was there with my friends and we enjoyed the food at a very reasonable price ........service was up to the mark especially Mr Tarsem a very friendly guy.............i wish to visit this restaurant again.............thank
5

Still sitting here after our meal with a beer waiting for the rain to pass so thought I'd write a review. Lovely friendly service. Clean "A" rated premises. We had chicken biryani and an eggplant curry. Both were excellent and arrived piping hot. Would recommend and will come back next year! Hope this is helpful.

This is a fantastic eatery with friendly attentive staff! I love Indian food and could not fault any of the dishes we had! Everything was piping hot , flavoursome and something we won't forget for a long time. Awesome staff , the chef even came out to say a quick 'Hello' . What a lovely night we had here well recommended

Where to go in Little India? ? Too much choice. I grew up in England and have lived in SG for a year now. I like clean, air conditioned premises offering a service-oriented experience. This place delivered. Nice attentive staff. Food was wonderful and while I ordered a familiar dish, the sauces and spices left me wondering what secret ingredients had made it taste so good. I recommend if you're in the area.

A very welcoming and friendly place, AOI is a haven along Race Course Road. Forget the other, really large places a few doors away... Aromas provides great food and a VERY classy atmosphere. The service is professional and polite, with simple things (like refilling your water glass when needed) done discretely and personally. The food is excellent, as is the decor - the ceiling alone is worth a visit. I enjoyed the Sizzlers menu - the chicken sizzler is uniquely spiced and served on a hot plate. Next time, I'll try the lamb one. I also love the lamb dishes - the lamb is not mutton, it's proper lamb and cooked very well so that there's not a smidge of toughness. Go for the unique menu items, but return for the whole environment. Oh, and the prices are extremely reasonable - better than so many of their competitors. Wine is available by the bottle, as is a fairly well-stocked spirits cabinet

a small group of five of us had made a prior reservation and upon arrival were shown to our table.this restaurant is a place for an experience in enjoying good indian (north) food, leaning more to punjabi rather than mughlai cuisine. this is most likely due to the capable management of mr tarsem singh who comes from punjab.the decorations are basic and the overall ambience fair but this is more than made up by an excellent range of dishes. truly bringing out the aromas of north india.mr tarsem was kind enough to customise our orders to the amount of spiciness needed and exclusion of certain ingredients to suit our taste.the breads were well baked, the curries were aromatic and suitably spicy and not floating in oil and the tandoori items (we had the chicken tikka) served hot and well done with the addition of the usual indian garnishings.the prices are very reasonable for the high quality fare.the service is a tad slow but let us be fair the staff were working hard to service an almost full restaurant and with a smile. the orders were duly served without any mixup.this place is suitable for families and highly recommended for a dining expereicne of truly authentic north indian fare, served with a sincere smile.just for reference the restaurant does substantial business in take aways and catering services are available

Generally one of the better places in Little India with a good comprehensive menu that goes beyond the stock standard butter chicken. Also, very friendly service, which can be rare to find in Singapore

This is by far one of the best Indian restaurants we have had to date. We are about to enjoying meal #2 here because the first time was so great.We had vegetable samosa's, chicken masala and naan. All amazing.Tarsem Singh was so good to us, which made us want to come back even more.If in the area of Little India this is a must!Thank you Tarsem!10/10Can't wait to come back!Cheers from Michelle and Sarah - Canad

Excellent customer service, extremely good food and warm staff. They are the most consistent in their food and customer service amongst all the North Indian restaurants in Singapore. The recommendations are always spot on, and I've always had a very good experience whenever I've been to Aromas

I went in for lunch on a weekday after reading very good online reviews. The place was quite empty except for 2 other families. With relatively few customers, one would expect good customer service, but I was to be disappointed.There was only one male staff to be seen. He just passed us the menu and went back to the cashier. Looking through the menu, we decided to order light, lamb briyani and lamb sheek kebab to share. We had to wait a while for the staff to take his eyes away from his phone and take our order. We requested cold water, but what we were served was room temperature tap water. The decor we noticed, looked quite old and the wall colour was faded with white streaks, for what is a quite new business location for them. We had to wait quite long for the food to arrive, keeping in mind by this time we were its only patrons. The food arrived less than warm. the portions small. the seekh kebab looked hastily plattered and was average. The briyani was very dry. The only redeeming factor was the well spiced lamb pieces in the briyani. More care should also be taken in maintaining the place as the floor area next to the toilet was wet and could easily lead to a fall. The whole time we were there, the staff was either shuttling in and out of the restaurant or busy with his phone. He never even bothered to check in on us keeping in mind we were the only patrons at that hour.I think the staff at aromas of india should be given customer service training What was also missing were the sweetened fennel seeds that restaurants usually offer. I never thought I would be writing a bad review about a place that I had read so many positive reviews about. I guess there's always a first

I read the reports before going. We arrived just before 3pm, and although the restaurant actually closed at 3pm we were welcomed. After a discussion about Singapore tap water we proceeded to order. Chicken Tikka, Chicken Tikka Massala, Paneer Masala, Sheek Kebab, various nans and poppadoms. We were given a free Gulab Jamon for dessert. The food was excellent quality and at a great price. Family Friendly and certainly worth a visit

Food was great and reasonably priced. Staff were friendly. A bit random as had to order starters and then order mains once had eaten them! Restaurant lacks atmosphere, would suggest turning the tv off as it distracts people and doesn't help conversations to flow!

Like others, we tried this restaurant because of the good reviews. Perhaps our expectations were too high, but we were rather disappointed. The staff were very friendly and the food was very tasty but our starters were delivered to the table at the same time as the main courses. In fact one of the starters was the last dish to reach the table. I had a lamb dish and I managed to find four small cubes of lamb in the pot at the beginning but had to stir around in the gravy to find any more. I found two more. The meat was very tender but there was just not enough of it. My wife had ordered a lamb sizzler but the lamb had ceased to sizzle long before it reached the table. With everything arriving on the table at the same time, and there being so little of it, we were in and out in just over half an hour. The cost was reasonable. I don't like raining on the parade when others have enjoyed this restaurant so much but I'm afraid I can't agree with the other reviews. I only hope that we picked a bad night

We went to this restaurant for dinner, based on the Trip Advisor rating. The place is in middle of little India, next door to the Banana Leaf. Food was very good and service was efficient. Total cost for two was 65$ which makes a good quality /cost ratio for Singapore.

I enjoyed most of the dishes even though I've never been a fan of Indian food. The fried chicken on the starter (I forgot the name) was my favourite

We were staying in Oasia at novena square and traveled here twice for the food and service the chicken tikka was perfectly marinated the phulka the dal and veg dishes we ordered on two nights were tasty and perfect good taste ..you will love it

What a great find! We have lived in Singapore for over a year and I can't believe I haven't tried it till now. The food is the best Indian food I've tried outside of India! The staff are wonderful and it's great value. A must-try for both tourists and expats

On reading others reviews on this restaurant we caught the train from our hotel and found it very easily. We arrived at 10pm and were greeted with a smile. We chose some vegetarian samosa , chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and rice. All dishes were beautiful. We both had a glass of wine and received a top up and free dessert. We were very happy with the friendly service and delightful food and wine. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Indian delights
