The Forketta is a very cosy and beautiful place. The service was perfect and the food delicious : particulary the Black Angus beef carpaccio. Bravo to the Chef Giovanni ! For me it's the best Italian restaurant
I strongly recommand !

The location is conveniently located near our apartment at Fraser Suites. They also have a daily "set" for under $18 which is a great value!

it was extremely delightful dinner with my friends here. Both food and drinks were absolutely beautifully, especially pizza, i thought this was the best in Singapore. Friendly and kind staff also made us very satisfied. The location is easy to get. Price was affordable. Surely It will be a highly recommendation for my other friends

The location of the restaurant is nice and I had a nice dinner here two years ago. But this time around I was very disappointed. First of all the staff hardly speak English. Secondly my colleague who joined me who ordered a Carbonara pasta got undercooked (cannot call it al dente) pasta which was flat tasting. I ordered a Wagyu steak, medium rare, only to get it sliced up (why do this???) and rare; it looked and tasted terrible and the pieces were cold inside and luke warm outside. I sent it back and changed it to medium and asked them not to slice it. When I got the steak it was tasteless and had so much muscle in it I could hardly cut it (then I realized why they cut the previous steak themselves) and chew it. Terrible

La Forketaa was recommended to me, while on a holiday trip to Singapore. I loved every single bit of it: professionalism of the staff, fast service and the most important the food was amazing in taste and presentation. It just made me feel; the money was well spent! I would recommend a visit

We had dinner with our kids at La Forketta Dempsey yesterday and we have been disappointed by the quality and the presentation of the food. When you pay SGD 35 for a basic pizza you indeed expect more that 4 slices of average tomato next to 5 small pieces of artichokes... The spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste (the colour of the bacon was strange as well). Last but not least, the warm chocolate cakes were dry and... not warm and the kids did not finished them (quite unusual).We understand they need to pay the rent at Dempsey Hill but charging SGD 487 for a very basic dinner (nothing "gastronomia" at all) for 2 adults and 3 kids is much too high for what we got in our plates.The only positive point is the smile of the staff (and the design of the place).We however won't go back just because the building is nice and the staff smiling

Service and setting were good here, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for the food. I ordered lasagne and was surprised to find there was hardly any meat and tomato sauce in it. Mostly, it consisted of green pasta sheets and white bechamel sauce. Very heavy lunch, no need to drive that far for it!
