Japanese bakery, at very good price and taste. I live in Holland Village, and tried all bakeries, obviously my best is Provence.
The upstairs cafe is nothing special, but you can have a more quiet time than the other nearby chain shops.

The cafe upstairs is vert hot! The air-con is very duty and is not working well due to poor maintenance!
Hope that the owner will improve the cafe environment to provide a conducive ambience to dine in.

I came here with my daughter. She wanted a kids meal ham and cheese toasties ($7.50) which she love it. I ordered a cheese cake and a cappuccino. Cheese cake is really rich, creamy and delicious ($9.50), my cappuccino ($5.50) is one of the best I ever tried. I will come again and I highly recommend it. Location: 2nd floor, mandarin gallery, orchard roa
