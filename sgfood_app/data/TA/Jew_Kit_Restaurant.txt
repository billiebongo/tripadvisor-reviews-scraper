Went for lunch and ordered chicken rice and noodle. the noodle was in big potion and taste good. The rice was normal and the potion is a bit small for a guy.

One of the few places where my partner actually finds multiple vegan dishes that are also super flavourful. Great variety of food and always busy. Nevertheless we always manage to get a table and the food arrives within 10 minutes.

We make a bee line to the restaurant at Killiney Road whenever in Singapore. Their food is fresh and delicately spiced. The Hainanese chicken rice is divine, as is the shredded chicken in black pepper and the sweet and sour pork. The longan melon drink and the plum and mint drinks are lovely in that the taste is unexpected but nice. Do try this place

This became our local eatery this time when we stayed in the burbs of Singapore. Such a relief to get out of the tourist areas and feel local. Jew Kit is a friendly, informal local place serving up a more than reasonable Hainanese chicken rice with a variety of what seemed to be daily special sides (as well as many other dishes from an interesting and fairly extensive menu). Staff were helpful with suggestions and were always spot on. If you find yourself in one of the condos in this part of town, do checkout this place for good food at very reasonable prices. Our grandchildren were also welcomed here

Visited this small restaurant with 3 friends and children. We ordered a variety of local dishes. The food was delivered very quickly and was extremely tasty. The staff were very attentive and there was a clean serviced bathroom.The price for the quality and quantity of food was fantastic.Would highly recommen

During our trip to SG we had one of our many dinners here in Jew Kit. The place was so fully packed that we had to share a table with a group of three persons, which was just fine. It was good to talk to local people.The food we ordered came quickly and was really, really good. Just perfect to our needs on that time.What I can recommend, is a drink made of plum juice and coke - yes, you read it right!It tastes very special and plum juice gives extra kick to coke!The service was smooth, friendly and quick. And the food: Thumbs up

After checking out other eateries along row of ships decided Singapore Hainanese Chicken rice cannot be a wrong choice. The rice was bland, the poached chicken also bland. What helped was the ginger and chilli sauce. The saviour was the bitter gourd salad, it was served cold in tangy sauce w some chilli bits. It had crunchy bite. Very refreshing. No bitter taste at all.

This is a Hainan style place, with chicken as a specialty. It's comfortable and fun. The food is great. I had dry noodles, plus a dish of pork. It was so good, just had my dinner there right now. Would def recommend. Basic place, don't expect too fancy, but genuinely tasty fare. I've been here a few times lately & really like it! Hope you do too

I eat here often and is my port of call after 9pm as is one of the few open. But this is only because I eat that late often. it is well priced, great atmosphere, very retro, quick service and reasonably healthy. (More steamed veg would be good

The cafe boasts a retro style and it's very attractive to people like me who admires retro stuff. The cafe sells a lot of local food such as chicken rice, local tze char dishes and many more. Ordered the chicken rice and the seafood crispy noodles and generally they suit my taste bud. Chicken rice is flavorful and the chili sauce is spicy enough. The seafood crispy noodles is abit on the salty side but it's ok coz I prefer strong flavoured food. Overall it's a nice cafe, and there's too many dishes to try, and I will be going back to try some other dishes the next time :

Chicken rice is absolutely legendary and ridiculously cheap - 6$.
Sweet potatoe fries not bad.
Service is adorable.
Most of the dishes are really good and cheap.
Open until midnight, usually crowded, awesome little place

Had the chicken rice set meal and damn, it was delicious! Service was good and definitely a place worth going to again

I've spent 5 weeks in Singapore and lived just 10min away, I ate there so often that by the end the staff knew all my favorites. Great food, lovely atmosphere and very smiley staff. Try their garlic kailan, absolutely the best!

We dined here a couple of times during our Singapore visit. The quality of the food was good and the service swift. The service here was also warm and the smiling waiter made some great recommendations. Overall, a good experience.

A good place to try the local food with out being overwhelmed. Low seating and small tables, but fast service and good food. Cheap eating and filling. No frills.

the chicken wings were excellent - moist, juicy with a faint taste of anis. im used to sub-par rice being used at all these old chicken rice shops and i was pleasantly surprised to find the rice served at this resto to be firm, fragrant and shiny. the star of the show has to be that perfectly fried egg withs its crispy edges, velvety whites and that beautifully gooey center. the staff were attentive - even offering tissue when they saw me spill some coffee c. good value for money at 8.50sgd i got wings, rice and kopi c. not bad at all

Stumbled across this cozy place since its opening and slowly it became my favourite spot on Killeney. Simple but delish Hainanese chicken rice and mee goreng! All the fried-rice items are super good too. I'm sure you will never get disappointed. Friendly staff offer good service plus everything is on par. Thumbs up

Went for dinner and ordered the crispy noodles with seafood, the vegetarian noodles, rice with sweet and sour pork, pork in black pepper sauce and Chinese tea. The whole meal came to S$32... If you convert it to INR it is a tad expensive but it's worth the taste, the warm hospitality and the beautifully designed menu. The Goreng seemed to be a popular dish along with the chicken rice as that was being ordered quite a lot. Also this is a place that the locals fill up and frequent which immediately should tell you that the quality is good and reliable... I will go back there to taste the legendary chicken rice! The waiters were very warm.

We ate here on the first night and had a meal for two and drinks for under Â£10. The food was good and it was full of locals. We ate here again during our stay as it was just around the corner from out hotel. I tried the traditional chicken and rice which was excellent.
5
We were staying across the street and wandered into here late one night after a long haul flight. Hungry and very tired, this was the busiest of the restaurant along this row which we assumed was a good sign! The food is amazing, simple local dishes but the best sweet & sour chicken ever. No alcohol here, the soft drinks are rather hit & miss but cheap enough to just order another one if you don't like your first selection

Visited with two grandsons today "Nani, can you make this at home, we can call you with a secret code". This is best chicken rice we have had so far, the bitter melon salad and fragrant tofu amazing. A 9.5 out of 10 for us.
5
we love enjoying our meals in this little retro restaurant. Delicious fresh food and friendly service. Also good for a cheap but filing meal!

Its a nice restaurant, very close to sommerset mrt station, very delightful and tasty asian dishes. Service is fast, clean place.
5
We came back late one day around 10.30pm and the restaurant still serves food. Tried the fried rice, wanton noodles, sambal kangkong and chicken rice. Impressively all was delicious. Good place for a late dinner or supper.

Adding to the yummy and tender chicken, the outlet in Killiney is retro! Give a good idea of coffeeshop during the 20s in Singapore

We were staying on Killiney road and after a tiring day at Universal studios decided to go for a simple and quick meal of Chicken rice so dropped into this delightful restaurant with a very interesting dÃ©cor next to our hotel. Jew Kit has a wide variety of tropical mocktails which tasted delicious and refreshing after a long day in the sun. The hainanese chicken rice was very tasty as was the pork gravy dish we ordered. The service too was very good
4
Meal sizes we had looked like tapa size. Do try the local deep fried tofu- Devine. The mee gorong was very tasty and fresh. Drinks were cold and refreshing. Sat outside and enjoyed the street ambience. Prices were excellent $16 for these two dishes and drinks

This is on the Killiney Road, about a seven minute walk from Orchard Road. The place opens out on to the road, and is its best to get a table by the road and watch the world pass by. That said, the food is predominantly Singaporean Chinese. If you like your pork dishes this is a great place because they make it fresh and quite tasty. Lunch is about 10$ per person, but that depends on what you order. Jew Kit is a staple go to for me while in Singapore
5
Named after the owner, this place is a great little pit stop for local food. Meals are served hot, are full of flavour and are service is efficient and friendly. There are cheaper meals in town but if you come in to Singapore on a late flight this place is worth walking down to as it's close to Orchard road and open until midnight

If you are new to Singapore and staying near Orchard Road, the Jew Kit is a great place for your first taste of Asia. The Jew Kit is a quaint little restaurant with small stools and tables and a very eclectic decor. The food is a good selection of chinese style food and is in a spotlessly clean environment. It is a little more pricey that a hawkers stall but still very reasonable and a great place for those that may be new to Asia to begin. There are the usual favourites such as sweet and sour pork and chicken rice, together with other more interesting options. It is simple, clean, well priced. The service is very good and the taste of the food excellent
