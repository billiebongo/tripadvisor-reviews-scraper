Went here on Wednesday evening. Ordered on iPad, all smooth. Unfortunately the food never showed up in spite of repeated apologies by the staff. Left hungry after 50+ minutes of waiting in vain. Shame because the tiramisu dessert is not bad at all.
3
Signature dishes are chicken. Portion was more than sufficient. Busy on a friday night. Salad was expensive.
4
Excellent food. A very busy restaurant. It was disappointing that all of our meals did not arrive together.
4
Can recommend the roast chicken with Diane sauce and mashed potato- we've been traveling in Indonesia and Malaysia for a month so this meal hit the spot!
You order yourselves via iPad which the kids enjoyed and you can easily see how much you're spending.

Called in for a quick lunch while shopping in raffles city,not sure at first because I fancied sushi but very impressed and quick my wife ordered 1/2 a roast chicken in lemon sauce it just fell off the bone and so moist and the creamed mash were wonderful,i decided on the tuna and salad no complaints,ordered on iPad at table quick and efficient and very reasonably priced with great service
4
We tried the Christmas Roast Chicken for lunch and it was tender and tasty. Also ordered their mushroom soup (excellent), truffle mash potatoes, salad de paris and sauteed mushrooms. All are good and service was prompt and good too. Poulet is a good option among the many eateries at Raffles City
4
We called in for lunch during a shopping trip, we where pleasantly surprised, we shared a very tasty avocado topped with chicken and mayo, I then had the ox tail and my wife had the carbonara, both meals where very fresh and tasty, much better food than you expect from a food court restaurant. Good service at a reasonable price. Give it a go
5
Decided to try Poulet Restaurant at Raffles City Shopping Centre and was not disappointed that I did. The staff are fantastic and the food was absolutely delicious, also VERY well priced. I would go as far as to say the food was some of the best I had in my 15 days in Singapore, ate there often. Would HIGHLY recommend the mushroom soup and garlic toast, but all meals I had were divine. A true gastronomical must do ❤
4
If you want fast service (without sitting in a fast food restaurant) this place is fine. The choice is limited, the quality is good and if you like chicken, this is the place for you. I enjoyed avaocado with chicken in a lemon mayonnaise. The half chicken are manageable - they are fairly small but well cooked. The service was friendly and for a quick bite to eat it is okay
4
Service was efficient however staff seems careless, did not inform us about the promotion item that was showing in the front of the shop (we came in for that) but we did not ordered the promotion as we felt the regular menu was more worth it. Lemonade came really gassy, thought it wasn't supposed to? Mashed potato was really creamy and smooth! Half chicken was moist, tender and juicy! The sauce of cranberry with dijon mustard tasted really amazing with the chicken! Sweet with a tint of spiciness heat, best part - cranberry sauce is refillable!! (Like whutttt!) bet you didn't know!
4
came here for work lunch, food was rather decent - we had the half chickens and pasta. service was polite and friendly as well.
3
We had dinner here and it tasted good although the Parmesan cheese was way over the last usage date.
We ordered pasta as a main course including bread ... and thank god for the bread because the pasta portions almost disappeared on the plates.
5
Favourite mushroom soup in Singapore is here!! Hands down. Get it. The chicken is also amazing. Portions were generous and we were stuffed after our meal. Make reservations through chope in advance so that you can beat the queue
4
The restaurant is popular with roasted chicken. It is soft and delicious. Must try restaurant when you are in Raffle City.
4
poulet never disappoints! better to share amongst more friends to able to share more dishes! more variety is always good
4
Came for dinner yesterday. pros : looked at the menu on the ipad.. placed our order. from the ipad which is pretty easy to use. there was a promotional deal which was pretty decent - half a chicken, 2 drinks and 2 sides for 2 persons (only $32). The chicken was surprisingly done well and rather tasty. The side dishes are pretty small in portion. cons : the main dining area gets noisy when it gets fully occupied. i had to ask for another table on the other side which was less crowded. service was, as expected, just average. nothing out of the ordinary. good for casual meets but sit away from the main area

While visiting for three days in Singapore we searched for a good basic place to eat and found Poulet in the Raffles City Shopping Center to be a good choice. They offer various style of chicken along with good sides. This is a limited menu specializing in chicken (not fried) but more in the French tradition. Poulet has more than one location in Singapore. This is a sit down and someone waits on you restaurant. Service was good. Food was good. Prices were fair for Singapore. We ate here twice during our stay and found it a comfortable place to eat within walking distance from the hotel
4
Went in for the first time at Poulet and we were not disappointed with what we ordered. For a starter, we ordered mushroom soup and seared tuna salad with a refreshing vinaigrette. The whole roasted chicken was tender and juicy. The chicken dish was brilliantly plated. The food attendant suggested the white sauce for the chicken but later we realized that it was liquidy to our liking. Nevertheless, With or without the sauce the chicken was flavorful. Maybe next time, we'll try the pepper sauce . To finish the meal, we requested for the chocolate dome cake. The food attendant poured a hot choco cream on the cake and it collapsed which made the experience fun. By the way, the whole chicken can feed a group of four. It is not a place eating on a budget though.

I visited Poulet on 24 Sept 16. I was a little disappointed by the size of the Poulethalf chicken as they almost seems like size of half a quail.However taste wise, I must admit that the dish I ordered wasrather tasty; in a smooth creamy sauce. Two pictures are shared of myso-called half chicken. Price for dish was $16++ on menu.There was a strand of hair found on my friend’s dish beforeconsuming the meal & they immediately change it.That is good service.On a side note, “Escargot” is French; translated into English: meaning “Farm Cultured Snails”. Yes. . .that’s right . . . Snails are what you see crawling on the pavements and in your garden. Escargots are cleaner since they are farm cultured and non-toxic due to the selected species.If you still find the ideas of eating snails yucky, maybe I found company . . .ha ha. I hope this review helps

Well we found this place to eat by first looking up food options in Raffles City, and have eaten there twice. The first time we had the half roast chicken with pepper sauce, mashed potatoes and garlic bread, as well as meatballs and mash with Diane sauce. The meatballs needed a bit of seasoning but we're OK, hitting a spot for a simple bite to eat, would not necessarily rave about them though. The draw card is the roast chicken ! Yummy describes it well. The pepper sauce has a bite and kick, which if this is what you are after, I can recommend it, otherwise go for a milder sauce. The mash is smooth and creamy. The garlic bread is thinly sliced and ok, but again not a standout. And desert? We went for the creme brûlée and it holds its own, nice and smooth with a cracking sugar crust. Our score reflects both the quality of the chicken meals and the desert, as they hit the spot for quality comfort food. Enjoy
5
We happened to read poulet review on Trip advisor and thought give it a shot, well it paid off. We had 3 dinners there during our 8 nights trip. Excellent food, the best Christmas dinner, so authentic...
Will be back, certainly
4
Nice place with really good roasted chicken. Althou the portion of the half chicken is not big enoug if you are really hungry. The chicken with the chardonay sauce is really ggod. Service is good. But it can be quite crowded
4
Friendly service staff who will ensure your every need is met wkth a smile! Will be back for more again
5
Really friendly staff and the food is delicious and at a reasonable price! Will recommend to my other friends!!
4
Have been here many times and my favourite dishes includes the mushroom soup and the truffle mashed potato!
4
The roasted chicken taste very good with the signature sauce. It was a sumptuous meal with an excellent ambience
5
 I have been staying in Singapore with my husband while he works, so eating alone has become a regular experience. I thoroughly enjoyed Poulet, the food was delicious. I was concerned that half a chicken was too much, but they are small birds cooked to perfection. I chose the Chardonnay and mushroom sauce and a side of mashed potato with truffle. The service was great too!
4
Order 2 half chicken(Poulet Roti with chardonney sauce;cranberry sauce),a snacks platter and Duck Au Vin for 4 adults and a toddler.Personally,I dont really like the chicken with chardonney sauce as it was bland and creamy,but the chicken was very well cooked.The rest of the dishes are ok.I love the cranberry sauce!will come back for it. The bill came up to SGD 70 plus.reasonably priced
5
We had a recent trip to Singapore......my hubs for business, and me for shopping. I was a bit concerned about what I'd eat, as I hate Oriental food, Chinese in particular. It was so very pleasing to find Poulet in the Raffles City Shopping Centre. We hadn't booked, but the manageress ( we assumed) found us a pleasant spot, and was very attentive whilst we were there. We chose the half chicken with cranberry sauce, and it was absolutely delicious. I visited again while there, as it was so refreshing to find lovely, normal food, which didn't cost the earth
4
We had half a chicken with mushroom Chardonnay sauce each. Truffle mash potatoes were nice. Grilled vegetable ordinary. Tried the soups on an earlier visit. Mushroom soup was better than onion soup but if you are ordering chicken with Chardonnay sauce, I'll suggest you not order the mushroom soup as it's too much of similar stuff in a meal. Didn't like the pizza like item order previously either. Next table's tiramisu looked good. I'll go back for the chicken and try the dessert!
4
Food was good, service was prompt. We missed the crispy pizza dish on the menu, which was taken out after a menu update. That was unique to the restaurant and very good.
3
Better is portion is bigger for the main course. Ordered a set menu for 2 person and added 2 more main dishes. Just nice for 3 pax meal :(
4
Enjoyed both the food and the customer service at the rAffles City outlet.
Very generous with sauces refill and great I giving right recommendation on food choices.
Nice dining experience.
4
Enjoyed the visa $10 off promotion code using chope app link. Food was good and was identified immediately when at the restaurant.
4
the service was kinda slow but the food was ok. the mash potato had too much butter but the chicken was not bad.
2
The pictures look better than the real ones. The onion soups are little too sour. The cranberry meatballs are not bad but not special. The escargot...will not order them again next time. Peach Clafutis is too sweet. Not the priority choice in the future.
4
Very Tasty meal, although the chicken was a little on the small side. Good meal set, staff very helpful.
5
Trying something new and to find food is good. Their specialty is the chicken and it is very good especially bring young kids.
4
Booking was very convenient! I arrived there and table was ready. My friends and I had a good time. Thank you.
4
It didnt take much time for us to get a table even though the restaurant looked packed. The food took longer than average but when it came it was very appetising. The chicken was very tender and the sauce was delicious. When the mashed potatoes came, firstly it was served to us in a paper cup and it wasnt really nice; it was basically just butter and cream. Overall, apart from the mashed potatoes the food was nice but the service coule be improve
4
Ate a quick dinner meal here as the wife wanted mash potato and I saw the tuna baguette on the menu which looked good. Kids were happy with fries and a plain baguette.
4
Their signature dish is always good - their rotisserie chicken - lam shank pretty good and starteets and desserts are also quite good - bistro style French food at sgd 30-40 a head
Few branches in Singapore.
2
poor food, poor service, unfriendly and unhelpful staff. Not particularly nice surroundings, more of a fast-food type place without the ambiance.
5
If you are looking for a great choice and excellent food at a good price, go here. More western style food (well, French to be exact) on offer - we had the lamb shank and braised duck, which were divine.
3
When Poulet first opened up in Singapore we were enthusiastic devotees. Though focused on chicken dishes their restaurants offered tasty and innovative dishes such as wrapped halibut and duck salad. This meal, however, was a pale imitation, with disappointing, unremarkable escargots in garlic/onion and tomato sauce to the ludicrously small 'baguette, in reality just four small, thin slices of bread. The braised chicken in broth was unremarkable. A disappointment all around. Having said this, the glazed chicken winglets was the one redeeming dish
4
Very good food, but the place is a little too noisy. The noise is due to the ventilation blower humming, probably because of the low ceiling. And the table spacing is too close, (no conversation privacy) typical of restaurant squeezing every last inch of space to maximize seating
5
Great little restaurant when you are craving a change from Asian cuisine. They specialise in small half roast chickens that are served with your choice of sauce. The mushroom & Chardonnay sauce is particularly tasty. Side orders, such as garlic mashed potatoes, and even escargot, can be added to your order. Quick and tasty food at a price that won't break the bank. Recommended
3
We loved the roast chicken especially that there's s deal for the quarter chicken a drink and a side line for 9.99 sgd. however the baked halibut fish was a letdown . Its fishy and was so plain and it costs 17 sgd. would return for chicken :
4
We ate in the evening and enjoyed the special; mustard chicken. A delicious sit down meal with good service. Strangely we asked for water and were charged 50cents. No problem but when it came it was warm! There can be queues at busy times but worth the wait. More expensive than the take away meals in the court but the value is there
4
My husband and I were here for lunch and split a half chicken with the staff recommended mushroom sauce (delectable), the mushroom appetizer, and mixed veggies with the smallest asparagus I've ever seen. The food here is served hot, fresh, and efficiently. The sauce around the chicken awakened and delighted the taste buds. I expected a bit more flavor from the mushroom dish, but the meal overall was wonderful. I'm so glad we went here. The atmosphere is busy and can be a bit chaotic with patrons trying to flag down the wait staff by waving arms or raising one and snapping fingers. The atmosphere was a tad raucous with groups of people at the tables. But this adds to the ambience.
4
We had lunch there today tries few recommended dishes. Mushroom chicken, mustard chicken and desert. Great! Salad is unique as well. Service are ok and can be improve further.
4
Service was fast. i know everyone comes for the chicken but the oxtail stew here is actually worth the try. I love the mashed potatoes - so creamy good. The mushroom soup is also good without being too thick or cloying
4
Had dinner here and it is a nice cosy place to chill with friends. you also get nice food at reasonable price. the famous chicken are tender and worth eating
4
Dined at Poulet, the service was great and prompt. Had one of the beautiful chicken dishes, that was tender and melted in your mouth. The desserts were also lovely and would highly recommend.
3
My kids and I dine at Poulet regularly, at least once a month.Their signature chicken dish is good except that the standard is inconsistent. Sometimes, the chicken meat is so dry that itâ€™s almost impossible to eat. At other times, the chicken meat is tender and moist, which I believe, should be how it is cooked and served
4
Poulet in french means Chicken, and this place serves relatively delicious chickenseach chicken ordered will be served with a sauce which you must choose with the order. The mushroom sauce was nice and creamy. The orange sauce was sweet not our taste but one may find it nice. The vine tomato salad was mixed with olive oils and bits of fete cheese and it could have been better, but again was alright to our taste. The chicken was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender with aroma. We really liked the chicken and the taste. So if you wana try a great simple food with relatively good price this is a place to go
4
A really great meal. We chose half a chicken for both our meals which were very substantial, there is also a whole chicken option available.We tried one half chicken meal with an accompanying chardonnay sauce, mushrooms and spinach, the other found on the special board with an orange sauce. One side of butter rice with chestnuts. A second side of a basket of chips.Very tasty indeed. Great service and value too. Would recommend
4
French inspired menu which offers a broad range of items but the French Roast chicken is the signature which comes different base sauces. I had the mushroom chardonnay sauce and it was was tasty. Service was friendly quick and efficient and would recommend for quick on the go mea
4
I was sceptical at first, but since most of the restos have a long queue I smashed in a seat and rest my heavy backpack. In just a minute or so my roasted chicken is on the table and it is cooked nicely, it is juicy and tender. I enjoyed filling my rumbling stomach while satiating my palate. The half portion is too large for me, and you might want to order with potatoes or rice to compliment the taste. The staff are very warm and accommodating too
5
I ordered oxtail stew and mashed potatoes and it was served in record time. It was surprisingly very tasty considering it was served in under 7 min's. The service is extremely friendly and welcoming and the main reason for my 5 . Very homely atmosphere and definitely worth visiting again and again. Prices are very reasonable for the high quality of food and service.
4
This one stands out even in food-mad Singapore. The escargot are great, and their signature roast chicken was cooked to perfection (go easy on the sauce if you don't like it rich). The creme brûlée was pretty good too.
5
We went to the Vivo outlet for a quick lunch. Attentive staff who bought our order quickly. It was delicious and surrounds comfortable.
5
Had it twice. Once at Jurong East and Vivo City. Preferred the Vivo City outlet. the taste is stronger there. Food is nice, but slightly expensive. The onion soup is a must to start with.
3
visited this restaurant in changi airport. awesome roast chicken with cranberry sauce and truffle mashed potato, but quite pricey and te service needs improvement, location needs to be more strategicit's on the top floor which is quite bare and empty.
4
Visit here often with my family - Great chicken with a creamy mushroom sauce - Very good for Family's with kids - Lots of choice on menu
1
I think the title says it all...The chicken looks really great but it was the worst half chicken I ever had and for that it was very expensive as well!!!Better go to one of the Chinese Restaurants in the mall, those are really good.
4
Came here twice. Chicken was reported to be very good. I had Pork Belly again very good. Excellent, prompt service and reasonably priced.

The website saysFirst French Casual Dining Restaurant Chain Concept in SingaporeWell it is a restaurant and it is in Singapore. The service is pretty casual, you ask one member of staff and then another one comes and asks you what you want, and if you’re lucky then you get what you asked for.I had the chicken in chardonnay - the chicken was almost bereft of meat and the sauce was greasy and synthetic tossing in a few tinned mushrooms didn't help. My companion had the halibut en papillote, which, unlike the chicken was quite adequate.I ordered a side of mashed potato it was delivered with the main course I had to ask for it 3 times, and when it came I wished I hadn't. It was liquid. OK fair enough that maybe it hasn't seen a potato but the consistency of custard?? The staff seemed totally unmoved or not at all phased that I sent it back.An experience I wouldn't want to repeat in a hurr
4
Have not had such delicious juicy rotisserie chicken before. Ordered half chicken in mushroom sauce...chicken meat is moist, little to no fat, cooked to perfection. Also ordered baguette to dip the sauce. Has to come again for the food. The environment is a bit noisy though
1
Me and my friend had Dinner there because the chicken looked ao tast hanging in front if the restaurant but the taste of the cinnamon chicken was not really nice. Also the side orders were really not nice as the french fries were totally soft and uncrispy. In the end we got a bill that was way too high for that bad type of fastfood. Better choose one of the chinese Restaurant in this food court which are excellent.
3
Nice place for food. I cant expect much but so far met expectation. Truffle mash potato and roti chicken i ordered which somehow quite ok for me.
4
The staff were very friendly and greeted us in French. The service was efficient and the food was delicious. We would visit again.
4
Superb food (the chicken is superb) in a great little buzzy cafe in the basement of Raffles City. Not much else to say other than we would return for sure.
4
this is our 2nd time (the 1st were at vivo) going to poulet, both for lunchmy wife and our daugther love to have their roast chicken and the escargotthe half portion is enough for one personthe tiramisu is good, should give a try staff is friendlylocation wise is quite noisy as it sits in the mal

This review is for the branch in Kallang Wave mall...I have had a couple of friends recommend this place so we tried it. And it was quite disappointing. My pet peeve is overcooked chicken breast. I understand that chicken breast cooks at a lower temperature versus the thigh so roasting a whole chicken may be tricky but there is a way to get both parts perfectly. So if you will name your restaurant "Chicken", you need make sure you can roast it well. So I was quite turned off when the breast was dry and rubbery.Second, the chicken is tiny -- just a tad bigger than a cornish hen. Then there was the service. Where do I start? First, it took them almost 15 mins just to get our orders correctly. Then when we asked for ice water, they said that they cannot serve ice -- the only cold water is bottled water which of course they charge. So we ended up ordering warm water (which they also charge for) -- but fine, some other restaurants do. But then when we were leaving, the table beside us dropped their glass full of ice. I thought they do not serve ice????Lastly, we had a birthday cake and when I asked for a knife to cut it, they insisted on cutting. I was quite persistent I do it since I wanted to portion it properly but they refused. Then the 8" decadent chocolate cake came out in HUGE 8 slices. We ended up wasting so much since no single person can finish an extremely rich chocolate cake that was almost 2" wide at the thickest part. Our request was so simple.The only good thing was the ambiance... but who eats in a restaurant that looks good with lousy food and service. Not me!!! I don't think I will come back here
3
An unfortunate way to describe it but the staff were very disorganised. First, it took a while to get our order taken. The staff we dealt with were friendly but there was obviously confusion with our order. We decided to try the Escargot and the French Sausages for entree to be followed up with the half chicken (with mushroom & Chardonnay sauce - their signature dish). At first, they tried to give us the chicken before the entrÃ©es so we asked what was going on. They then tried to serve us the Pork Belly which we hadn't ordered (not sure where that ended up). The sausages finally came out but then they brought out the chicken at the same time and the escargot a short while after that so we had all the dishes on the table in one hit. The sausages and escargot were nice but the chicken was cold by the time it was served to us so it was quite a let down. The scores:Food Quality - 4 out of 10 (not a good idea to serve cold food)Service - 3 out of 10 (need to be better coordinated and get the orders right)Ambience - 5 out of 10 (not really for a romantic dinner especially when the dishes ended up being rushed)Value - 3 out of 10 (don't really like paying for cold food while being messed around by poor coordination)Overall Score - 3 out of 10 (a lot of improvements need to be made here

I want to make clear I am not a fussy eater, love all types of food and grew up in Europe so very familiar with French food and French style rotisserie chicken.  I really can't remember the last time I could hardly touch a meal because it was so inedible and felt not only physically sick leaving your restaurant but also starving.  I will go through each item 1/2 chicken and mushroom sause The chicken was still PINK!! and very obviously undercooked. It was luke warm. I had to eat around the undercooked pieces but in the end gave up having barley touched it. The sauce is awful, it's sickly and you can't taste any mushrooms in it...just a lot of what i guess is cream..in then end it was way to rich and tasteless. I moved the chicken to a separate plate after a while, even so was difficult with the chicken so undercooked and by this point ice cold.  Mash potato I have never seen mash that is a liquid. I'm not sure how much cream (again!) and butter and what the ratios of those to potato is but it was a liquid...truly disgusting. Mash should be silky and thick..not like this..again way too rich, sickly and tastless.  Ratatouille At least this was edible but still impossible to finish the plate. Firstly, very few vegetables where in it...it was just this weird very sweat tomato sauce, with the odd chunk pepper or the such... I have had ratatouille many times...never has it been sweat. It tasted like a desert! And why such few vegetables in it...the picture in the menu clearly has a normaly looking plate of ratatouille. So all this plus some water cost $36 and could eat next to none of it, I left the restaurant feeling quite sick. I then had to spend another $40 eating dinner elsewhere.  I would though like to commend the service I received, and when I mentioned the chicken was pink I was offered another serving...but I couldn't put myself through the tourture again so declined this

Poulet offers affordable French cuisine, with signature dish which is roasted chicken in a creamy & rich mushroom sauce. The chicken is tender and well marinated (even the bone itself full with flavor), and perfectly go with the "white" sauce. Not forgetting to also recommending the oxtail, which all ingredients are well blenched. Worth waiting / trying up this restaurant
1
All the food is microwaved! Yes they have five of them in the kitchen and you can both see them and actually hear them going off! I was shocked when i saw the 'chefs' in the back microwaving food. I had the pork belly and my girlfriend had the a chicken dish. They tasted dry and came out in under 5 minutes! Microwaved! You are better off going to McDonalds at least they cook the meat on the grill! They have 14 outlets in Singapore! Can you believe these guys turn a profit! Someone should protest to the government to shut these guys down. National disgrace.NikoPro245 (3 reviews

Poulet, as its name suggests, serves mostly rotisserie chicken paired with a choice of sauces. I ordered a half chicken with a mushroom cream sauce for $15.90. The first taste was nice, but proceeded to become overwhelming. The chicken was really nice and tender though. Most places tend to overcook the chicken. I did wish there were more mushrooms, since there wasn't any carbo side dish.We also ordered a halibut ($15.90). It came about 5-10 minutes after my dish. It was ok.They charge for water, $0.50 for tap and $1.90 for mineral. I noticed that they had Earl Grey Tea, and I asked for an Ice version. They don't normally do it that way, but they agreed to try, so I appreciated that. It arrived and it tasted quite good
3
I had the quarter chicken and the french soup..chicken was too creamy..price was ok I spent around S$30 including a cup of warm water
4
As I walked into the restaurant, I was afraid I would knock into another table. Not much space is dedicated to the restaurant as the tables, in my opinion, are set too close to one another. But one cannot measure the success of an establishment by the ambience alone. The food counts too. The French Onion Soup is worth trying. Not only is it rich and thick, but the aroma from the onions permeates each spoonful. The main course was the Cranberry Poulet, which came in sizes of half a chicken or a full chicken. A dash of Dijon mustard was placed by its side next to the chicken. I found the mustard a trite overpowering, so stay away from it if it does not suit your taste. The chicken otherwise was roasted to perfection, soft and tender. To end the meal, dessert was a peach and creme brûlée combination. A very satisfying dinner indeed. A downside, apart from the cramped table space; is the fact that water is chargeable. I find it ridiculous that establishments charge for water straight from the tap (I assume). But, I guess, whatever it takes to bring in more revenue

Four of us visited Poulet during our recent trip to Singapore and what a lovely place to dine. It is not pretentious, simply a small restaurant in the basement of Raffles shopping centre, but the food was delicious, the choices multiple and the staff a sheer delight. Great value for money all round and the creamed potato, particularly the one flavoured with truffle oil, was really gorgeous. In fact, we were so pleased that we made time to visit again just a day later. After a hard day's shopping on the floors above, this place has to be recommended. Thanks Guys

Had my 1st Poulet experience in Bedok mall... It was after lunch hrs, pretty empty & we were quickly attended to by a server, most staffs were friendly and smiling.The menu was easy to understand, without a whole bunch of french / complicated words which enable us to understand what we were ordering, my wife decided to try the chicken (supposedly what they are known for... I was undecided & asked the waiter for recommendations, which he happily explained which is more popular, so i went along & order a lamb shank & baguette to dip in the gravy...Chicken: succulent, soft & goes very well with the mushroom sauce. the taste of cream rather compliments the roast chicken without really overpowering the chicken.Lamb shank: once again, the meat is soft, juicy, not hard to "operate" on with just knife & fork. The meat literally just came off the bone, knife suddenly seems kinda redundant... The gravy is thick & goes well with the baguette or I guess it would go well with rice as well due to the slightly salty flavor. Most important of all, the lamb does not have a very strong smell of game (羊膻味...Overall, I really look forward to going back to try some of the other dishes they have to offer

Three of us lunched at Poulet at Raffles City basement. Two of us ordered the French Roast Chicken which looks really good on the menu while our friend ordered a drink. The service was fast. The restaurant was quite crowded and we were given a table at the end of the restaurant but the servers were very attentive and took initiative to bring us to another table that was available when the customers left. I give them top marks for service !The roast chicken was a disappointment, while the chicken was nice and tender, the whole dish was too salty for both of us. Perhaps the cook was overzealous that day ? We had to constantly ask for a refill of water. I may give Poulet another try but I hope the next visit will be a better

just had a late dinner at the Poulet at the Singapore Airport. It's definitely one of the more attractive offerings at the airport though quite out of the way. Menu pics look quite inviting, so I gave it a try. I chose the chicken/fig sandwich - an interesting choice with croissant and the fig gave it a tangy flavour - quite liked it. Nice fries. also had potatoes au gratin - ok, not great. In sum, it's a step above fast food - but not a lot. I always judge a restaurant by ice tea. when you serve the kind of sugary watery ice tea like I just sipped, you know the love really isn't there - it's all about volume. Service was on / off. To be fair, i wouldn't want to be serving people in a hurry at the airport late a night (or anytime), but they seemed a bit indifferent. but, alas, upon my departure - a guy helped me find my luggage, so not all lost. Worth a try every now and then, but it's not on the top of my list any time soon
4
Had a lunch with a team of colleagues. For whatever reason, Poulét does not take reservations, but no worries, the lunchtime crowd at this outlet isn't so bad at all. They do take up a pretty big shop space, so there are sufficient tables and chairs anyway.Ambience was alright, but that's all very subjective. If you're seated right by the sides nearest the entrance, then you'll have to bear with shoppers of Raffles City SC walking by just about every second, and peering in at you and your meal. Further into the restaurant is of course away from the shoppers, but lighting is less, though not overly dim.Now onto the food. I tried the Pork Belly, the escargots and mushrooms. Pork Belly was great. It was very tender and tasty, although the gravy that came with it was a little too much for my light tastebuds. The escargot was also good taste-wise, but it wasn't tender enough at all. Frankly, go on a Royal Caribbean cruise and the escargot they serve onboard for dinner is much better.The mushroom were nice too, and at first it was a nice bonus that it came with what looks like a half-boiled egg. But when we cut into the egg, it turned out to be quite raw for what's supposed to be a half-boiled egg. These guys need lessons from the ramen chefs who make these wonderful eggs that comes with your typical ramen.Generally, the feedback from the rest of my colleagues was pretty good too. In the nutshell, Poulét serves okay food that's enjoyable, but they simply don't make a big impression 'cos you know you can easily get the same standard elsewhere, if not better

Location- At the basement of Raffles City Shopping Centre.Food- We ordered the wild mushroom, pork belly and a half chicken in the new orange sauce. My friend had tried that half chicken in the other two sauces, original and I cant remember the 3rd sauce which she tried. She commented that all 3 sauces are distinct and delicious. The wild mushroom is tasty. She said that compared to the other bistro, the wild mushrooms are salted just nicely rather than too salty at many other places. The pork belly is tender and good. I had difficulty cutting the half chicken. Lolx. Perhaps I should had done more biology to bisect stuff cos I spent a fair half an hour while she looked amusingly. Drinks- Yup warm water is 50 cents per pax. Refillable. Service- The service level drops when the places gets crowded. Hard to flag down a staff especially when we are seated at the ''alley area" where theres 2 tables only. Seems there are mostly situated at the main area

Before I rant, I will grant that the chicken here is tasty. Sadly, it's not worth the pain of eating here as the service is shockingly below par. From the host who put off seating us for a good five minutes to have an argument with the waiter, to the waitress who only grudgingly took our order, to the staff in the open kitchen who faffed about while half the restaurant stared at them, waiting for their food, there was no saving grace to the "service" here. Also, charging for tap water? Really?

The layout of the restaurant was rather peculiar. In order to make the most out of their floor plan, where an open kitchen occupied a significant space, seats ran along a narrow aisle beside the kitchen, an aisle which lead into another space behind the kitchen where more seats were available. With the kitchen in the middle of the floor, the seating space available in Poulét looked smaller than it really was. The general seating was reasonably spaced out enough to accommodate easy walking, except for those lined along the aforementioned aisle.I found the overall decoration and atmosphere to be quite attractive as much as it was perplexing in some areas. Passersby would be looking at diners seated at the aisle with open windows as if the diners were seated on a kerbside restaurant. It led to a romantic scene by looking from the outside, but not so much for those diners who had their dish being spied by everyone. Soft ambient light coupled with harsher spotlighting reminded me of dining under the streetlight, an element which lend a romantic sense to couples. Definitely a place for lovers to share a table at.While Poulét Roti dominated as the restaurant's signature dish, and right fully so, the other French food which one should try, which we didn't dare to, was Escargot de Bourgogne, the famous Parisian dish with snails. And with all thumbs up in the air while scooping continuously into our mouths, we agreed that this was definitely a great place to dine in. An unbelievably tender duck thigh coupled with cranberry lend an irresistibly appetizing taste to Braise de Canard, while creamy sauce soaked into the signature dish's chicken thigh made every bite a heavenly sensation.Poulét no longer often enjoy the long queue visiting its restaurant in Raffles City, but it is far from empty as well. With affordable French cuisine in the menu, it would still see returning customers despite the relatively low number of choices there. And where else could you get affordable escargot in Singapore? Not many I would surmise..
