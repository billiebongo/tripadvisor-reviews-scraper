Wide variety of mostly hybrid Singaporean fare. If you want fine dining, silver service soft music don’t come here and complain that it’s ‘smelly! This place is great
4
On the pricey end for market food but then, this is Balestair. The nearest other market where food is cheaper will be at Whampoa, quite a distance away. Decent variety of food.
4
We ate here on whim and we love everything we ordered. It turned out quite pricy for our budget but we don't regret it because the food was really good
3
This place was smelly and was a little dirty, but I guess the food was okay. The kids refused to eat here as it was quite messy.
4
You can get good varieties of stall here and food are consider cheap. My favourite stall is black chicken soup from old Chinese couple.
Be ware of western food stall the quality and taste of food is really disappointing.
5
another food court style hawker centre that provides a variety of cuisines to the locals and tourists. good chicken options. the Thai stall had good mango sticky rice and the Chinese stall egg fried chicken and chilli chicken were scrumptious.
4
I ate here in the morning with my friends. There are plenty of food and drink choices to choose from. I bought wanton noodles with bbq pork and my daughter have chicken rice. Both dishes are delicious. It's also very cheap only S $4.50 for chicken rice and S $4 for the noodle. I recommend this place to eat for a cheap meal

There used to be a popular food centre called Long House in Upper Thomson Rd that closed down a couple of years back. The stalls there scattered and a couple of them are now at this place.The chicken rice stall and the bloke who used to make excellent oyster omelette moved there. The fried banana fritter stall looked familiar but I'm not certain.Besides finding familiar food vendors, there are many other food stalls selling everything from satay (including pork which is sometimes hard to find), rojak, barbecued chicken wings, braised offal, and heaps of other stuff.Drinks, iced desserts, beer, and stout are also available here.While the centre is open 24 hours, not all stalls are open every day so it's a bit of a crapshoot if you are looking for something in particular.The centre is quite easy to get to being on many bus routes that connect with the MRT
3
Its doing business 24/7. Especially at the evening, these place sometime will be full. You can try some of Asian food from Thailand & others. Or just try some snack or dim sum, or just enjoy your hot coffee with a very cheaps for your pocke
3
Itâ€™s a clean and decent place for residents and office crowd to visit daily. Many selections of cuisines and finally they are doing well as compared to many years ago. I love most would be popiah stall and their carrot cakes, Indian stall and the chicken rice stall.

Review by Dr Sim. Quite good variety of food. Many stalls from Long House. Best stall is the Long House Soon Kee Duck Rice. No air-conditioning. Basic ambience. Basic service. Regards Dr Sim
4
best beancurd ive had in ages but as its divided into a night and day hawker center u coudl oly get it in the morning
the aunty sells it very cheaply and its a lot better than the rochor bean curd one!
5
Good local food court with a lot of different options. Prices are reasonable and food quality is above average. Wouldn't travel to this food court from far away but it's a good option for people staying nearby.
5
Always find good food, be it Chinese, Japanese or local. Even we get good Indian food managed by a Bengali couple.
4
Plenty of local food choices and should be good if you have foreign guests who want to try varieties of local food.
5
Craving for local delicacies? How about heading to this Balestier Market in Novena. They've got all the best local food you want. Start with the fresh fruits, Sugar Cane Juice, then move onto the Fish Ball Soup... Followed by the Duck Noodle Soup and Hainanese Chicken Rice! Oh so YUM!When you still have the stomach, spare some room for the local dessert and coffee. You'll have a very happy belly here!Thank me later and tell me what you think about this place.#rezaeatsSingapor

The stalls came and went and the food quality was also hit and miss. There used to be a tasty fishball and minced pork noodles stall. The current stalls provided a mix of popular Singaporean hawker eats like popiah, barbecued chicken wings, grilled seafood, chicken rice, Indian curries and Chinese style mixed rice. Although this venue is supposed to be opened 24 hours, it was only busy during the dinner hours. The crowd dissipated quickly as the night dragged on and many stalls closed
4
Visited on a Thursday evening, and while the Food Centre was doing a reasonable trade, it certainly wasn't too busy, so finding a table wasn't difficult.The range of different food stalls (Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Indian, Seafood, Satay, etc) was extensive, and appeared to cater for all tastes or moods, and the prices were very reasonable. I chose a stall serving Japanese food, and for S$5 I enjoyed a set meal of Miso (Soup), Boiled Rice and Teriyaki Chicken, which was tasty and of sufficient quantity. My wife chose a Stall serving Chinese dishes, and went with a bowl of ribs and noodles, which she said was very tasty. We washed the food down with two large bottles of Tiger at S$6.50 each, meaning we had enjoyed a filling meal and drinks for two at a total cost of approximately S$25, which is pretty good in my book
5
I spent a long period of time in Singapore recently and spent many an evening eating at the various eateries in this market. All good reasonably priced meals. Although I did enjoy the chicken wings and the Japanese Karage! Also try the sugar cane juice it is very refreshing
5
As a frequent visitor to Singapore to visit my daughter and family, as her apartment overlooks this hawker centre I am in there very often and have never had a bad meal. It does not get too busy and we've always found a free cleaned table whenever we have visited it. There's a reasonable choice of food and I usually go straight to the popiah stall. It is always excellent. I haven't yet run out of choices of food. The pineapple fried rice is well worth trying. If you are staying in the area, or passing by, I can recommend this hawker centre
3
Pretty ordinary food overall. Satay was not grilled,, sauce was below average. Their chicken wings were good but most of the other food was not of a quality I would go back for. Generally a disappointment.
4
More choices of local food to tryout, looking for chicken rice, it is available there. It is very reasonable.
3
Compared to other hawker and food centers, such as Newton, this is a very small one. Few choices in eats - but for Indians, there's a single Indian/Pakistani food joint with some veggie stuff.
4
had a great low profile business meal with a local contact. Long tables, pint of beer, freshest fish and crab possible. Nice asian sweet-sour seasoning, was a wonderful surprise !
5
Excellent stall for wonton noodles Seafood stall offers top fish at reasonable prices (half of those of normal restaurants)Owners and employees are very friendly apart from the lady of ice creams; I've seen her a few times loosing her temper ( I think she should better change her career to a less intense activity
4
Came here a few times as it was close to the hotel, and was not disappointed with the food on offer. The BBQ Stingray was my favourite, and was much tastier than the version I tried at Satay by the Bay. There are only a small number of stalls but there should be enough variety to keep most people satisfied
5
This amazing place was a few minutes walk from our hotel. We ate there quite often as there was so many dishes to choose from and the prices were exceptionally cheap. Three of us (partner, his 17 year old son and I) got dinner for $8.50 (total) one evening. Absolutely delicious local food that I highly recommend
4
I stayed nearby for a few times, so I visited this food center many times before. It was small, but different type of cuisines could be found there, such as Japanese, Thai, Indian, Sichuan, Chaozhou, seafood, rojak, laksa, bat kut teh, and the price was fair. As it was not as crowded as those famous food center, the ventilation was better, so I usually did not feel very hot during meal. This is a good place for meal, if your hotel is on Balestier Street
3
The times I stopped by there were not many folks so no lines to contend with. There is not a wide selection here, maybe because i was showing up for dinner around 9pm, but a quick review of the stalls showed rather limited selection.There was a fresh seafood stall that looked tantalizing, but i wasn't in the mood the three days i stopped by. Worth a visit for good, quick, and inexpensive food
3
After many failed reinventions the heritage Balestier market finally succeeded with a wide variety of good hawkers.Recommended stalls included:(1) Fish ball noodles(2) Herbal chicken(3) Prawn noodles (4) Wanton noodles(5) PopiahDecent crowd for lunch and dinner on most days.Although supposedly 24 hours it is mainly for lunch and dinner
3
I arrived here around 9.50 p.m. It was only 3 choices of noodle, 1 Hainan chicken rice, pre-cooked Thai food, chicken and pork offal soup and 1 choices of seafood.
I was looking for fresh Sri Lanka crab. No luck for me tonight.
3
Good seafood joints. Hot and sweet Singapore chille crab available but expansive. 750g at SDG 50.00.
But good in taste and value for money
3
It's an average place but with good variety of food. Bit crowd in peak hours. It's an average place to have food.
5
We go here every night for dinner 24hr just down the road from our hotel. Laksa $4 and Chicken and Rice set meal $6, lime ,watermelon juice $1:50 each Recommend it's a Hawker food centre
3
Its a convenient eating street if you are staying in the vicinity.. How ever I would not recommend that someone especially goes their for a visit. It has average eating joints.
4
The hawker centre very close to nearby hotels just walking distance. You can get the food from $3.50. Great variety of local food of your choice.
4
Many food options from many cultures. Really well priced and great options - although choose carefully! :) Not all menu options suit a western taste! Really enjoyed several meals here.
4
A small food court frequented by locals with around twenty kitchens serving mainly Chinese food. We ate North Indian but chicken feet soup, pigs brains and chicken nuggets with chips also available. Forget the expensive brew house around the corner - a 660ml bottle of Tiger costs S$6.95 here inclusive of tax
4
We got to Belasteir road at about 11.30 pm and was looking for a place to eat. Our hotel directed us here. The food was good and healthy too bacause there was no excess oil in my chicken and the spaghetti was done with olive oil. Great variety too.
4
Although the food court is not airconditioned, it is not hot due mainly to the design of the roof.Ordered a cup of coffee at $1.10 which is pretty reasonable.It is a 24 hr food court with food of all culture.Will go again to try out the food
5
there are lots of choices for food and beverages. food are cheap and yummy. the food centre is beside fragrance hotel oasis and very near the bus stop to toa payoh and novena.
5
Absolutely loved the food, buzz and the entire experience - the best food in Singapore can be found here. the small food courts dish out the freshest food- YUM !
5
A wide variety of stalls making true Singaporean food. All stalls make your food when you order as it's done very quickly. Prices are between $4 and $8.
3
There were around 15 - 20 hawkers in this place, could not find anything special. Reasonable location.
2
lack of good food n variety. only 3-4 stalls open till 9pm. normal place which you just want bite something
5
Not a lot of English spoken but we still got some good food! Prices, variety and quality were all great
5
This place is fantastic! Very close to many hotels, including mine.There is a great variety of food to satiate any kind of hunger, and at low prices to boot. Has a local feel but friendly enough for any wandering tourist. It consists of an open plaza with a roof, filled with food vendors; classic hawker center!My girlfriend and I had lunch here. She had wonton soup with pork and noodles, and I had spicy chicken in soy sauce with noodles. Afterwards, lychee ice for dessert was the perfect, healthy refreshment before stepping back out into the sun.We intend on having lunch here every day when we stop back at the hotel for a quick midday break
5
We were staying up the road and the taxi driver recommended this place. We ate here every night but one. There are about 10 food bars around a large eating area so you sit where you want and get your food from any of the providers. There is one bar which sells a large bottle of Tiger for 6.60 s$, much cheaper than anywhere else. I had my only chilli crab here which was quite pricey at 40 s$ but very nice. The other places generally give you a decent meal for 5-6 s$, or 2 to 4 pounds so really good value. Why pay more? It is open 24 hours
3
A small hawker centre in close proximity of the hotel made it very easy for us to stop by and get something to eat when needed.There are twelve or so stalls and 1 drinks stall which offer a general selection, though not what I would describe as a "classic touristy" selection. Lemon chicken and rice was good as was the japanese style omlette and rice with chicke
5
This is another foodcourt that we can choose near the Ibis Novena. The variety of the food is more than Mega Foodcourt. But the price is also affordable. You can eat chicken rice with only $3.80 and they also have a variety of fried food. You can go for breakfast since some of the stall already open at 7.00 am
