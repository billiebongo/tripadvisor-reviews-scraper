Despite the rather ordinary appearance and lower ground floor location, the food was very good and not too expensive. Fairly varied menu and the pizza’s were very nice. Happy to recommend.

The food is nice but when we order we already told the person we are paying individually but yet the bill was all together it takes us 25min to settle the bill is really bad

The place did not seem too promising from the outside but we did not want to look for another place and so took the plunge. We were pleasantly surprised at how pleasant the waiters and how tasty the food was. My wife has an asparagus salad and I had a wagyu beef with sweet potato chips. Both dishes were extremely good as well as the avocado and mango smoothie.Two nights later we returned!! Excellent.

Chose this restaurant because we saw a lot of people dining. So glad we did and we were not disappointed at all. We were quickly seated and ordered long black, mango passion fruit, half roasted chicken and prawn and sausage penne. They came in big portion and the taste was good as well. The price of the menu were not bad at all considering the prices in Singapore

Our first trial on the restaurant. All dishes came out excellent. We ordered the fried seafood platter, the ribs, the salmon and chicken legs with pasta. Big portion and tasted so good. The Spanish roast pork was the best. All of us liked it so much

Came here for weekday lunch, food was decent and value for money. Steak was a bit chewy but acceptable for the $20+ price. Desserts run out fast so be sure to get them quick especially the creme brulee. We preferred the sweet potato chips over the curly potatoe

Nice decor. The escargot and steak fries were excellent especially the accompanying sweet potato fries and orange juice glazed salad. Carbonara with poached egg was rich but nicely cooked. A little filling though. The Collinâ€™s Special Pizza was rather salty and the crust could have been crispier. Dessert was caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream. Good palate cleanser after the really salty pizza. Overall not too bad.

Celebrating colleagues' birthday, and their weekdays lunch deal is really worth the price. The BBQ pork ribs and the mixed grilled are superb. The main course comes with appetizer, drink/ dessert. The food is decent and good at the price we paid. Would definitely come again!

Our family of 5 went for lunch at the restaurant. The service staff was polite and friendly. The food we ordered came after 10 minutes and was delicious. The price was reasonable for the items we ordered. Will come back again.

Went to their coffeeshop branch at braddel. They have an outlet at marina Square finally. Nice food, friendly staff and must importantly big portion of food at low price! A place I will definitely introduce my foodies friends.

What more can I say with such a title!
Not my first visit here and I have to say that the service always impressed me. Even during their peak period with queue, they are providing me and my family a bespoke service!
Will definitely return!!

Four of us were out looking for somewhere to eat when we saw the sign for Collins.As it happened one of us was called Colin and it was his birthday so we just had to go inside.It was a very busy night but the staff found us a table and we didn't have wait too long for our meals.Everyone had something different and they were all very nice.The staff although busy were quick & efficient

Looking for morning tea, we stayed at the entrance to be seated. We were the only customers waiting there and even though there were staff inside we were ignored. Finally we were taken to a table but then moved to another just as we were sitting down - no easy feat when you are travelling with family in their 80's. We then had to wait far too long for menus, the order to be taken and for our drinks and a slice of cake which was inedible - very dry and not sure old how it was - to arrive. Funnily enough they were very quick too have us pay. There seemed to be lots of staff doing nothing and we will not be returning

We have passed this restaurant few times, always full and long queue, made us wonder and want to try. Today we went for lunch. Totally wrong choice! We arrived around 12:15, waitress was very friendly and offered us the AMAZING offers they have for lunch, which is free appetizer and drink/dessert. We ordered 3 main courses, 2 drinks and 1 dessert (I choose free dessert over drink). It took 45 minutes for the first appetizer to come out (chicken karaage), which hot on the surface and cold inside... I wonder how long they cooked it?? We gave our feedback and they said they will exchange it. 7 minutes later... the second appetizer came and not long after the third one. If you do your calculation, it is almost 1 hour just for appetizers! The "squid tempura" was very hard and oily, we didn't finish it.The first main course come ard 10 minutes later...and another 10 minutes for the rest to come. If you still remember the chicken karaage, the replacement came while we are having our main course.by the time we finished our lunch is almost 2pm, I asked for my dessert, 2:10pm my dessert.. banana caramel.. .is still no where to be seen... I gave up and asked for bill.Now I know why it is long queue, is because the turn around is very very slow.. Maybe just our table's luck that we have to wait for very long and have to ask for our food numerous times.For sure, I will not recommend this place for lunch unless you have 2 - 3 hours time

This place was quite packed when we arrived. We changed our table as the first one was too small. They were not interested taking our order really. We ordered beef bolognaise ($10.5), prawn & sausage penne ($12.5), some garlic bread ($3.9) and sea salt fries ($2.9). The pros on Collin's? Good question. Service was at best passable. But main problem was the poor taste of prawn & sausage pasta. No taste whatsoever!! Come on! Totally overcooked watery pasta. Their fries were also terrible. Dry and 100% tasteless. Bolognaise was little better, but surely below average. Only garlic bread was so so.This was my first time at Collin's. I will never eat here again. Place is also really noisy
