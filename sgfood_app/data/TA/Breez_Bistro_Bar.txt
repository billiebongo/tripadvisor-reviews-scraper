Ate here on our last night in Singapore as we preferred to remain in the hotel for an early night to catch an early morning flight..
Both had mushroom soup and tender steak cooked to our liking

Dropped by for a beer in the afternoon (located beside the pool).
Service was okay, great to get 30% discount as Guest of hotel

If you arew just after a quick snack or dinner by the pool this place is great. Pizza's are awesome.

We only wanted a light lunch and the waiters here were willing to assist us. We chose a mixed platter for two which was largely seafood bites and it was totally delicious.

We ate the club sandwiches out by the pool at 9pm, and it was divine. Large portions, good price, excellent staff.

Excellent chefs delivering high quality food for all tastes. East meets West at Breeze Bistro Bar....Come on in !

We always try and stop in for a burger when we're in this part of town. This time, we tried something different -- the chicken curry! Very tasty, and served piping hot.

My friend and I had lunch on 11 Feb at Breez Bistro and we ordered a rib eye steak , salad and seafood pasta. We were given complimentary starter of yummy warm pita bread to be dipped in a special spice oil . The staff are very friendly and they went all way to ensure that we enjoyed our meals such as when we mentioned that we are sharing our meals , the chef had our steak cut into two before serving to us so that it made easy for us to put on our own plates. We were impressed as this is first time that little things we mentioned , the staff take note : )We loved the food that we went back the next day with another friend to have lunch and ordered the yummy rib eye steak but so sad they run out of rib eye steak. I guess a lot of people may have liked the steak too!To the staff and chef at Breez Bistro: A big thank you for good food, good and smiling service and a good not noisy place in the afternoon for friends to gather and chat .

We had our weekend lunch in this restaurant Breeze Bistro located at 4th floor of Grand Mecure Roxy. Awesome service from the staff and sumptuous food. Their starter is their self made pita bread with special spice sauce. It was very fresh and yummy. Hubby and 1 ordered their Rib Eye Steaks and my daughter ordered a 3 meat pizza. All the food was tasty and nice. The staff was very nice, gave my gal a freshly squeezed orange juice free. The restaurant was facing the pool of the hotel. There is indoor or outdoor seating. Overall experience was great and we will definitely come back again

Staying at this hotel many times, had drinks at Breez Bistro Bar, but never a meal. Tonight we felt like something light, so decided to eat in. Other half chose fish and chips and salad. He reported fish to be very tasty and cooked well, despite being symmetrical in shape! The whole dish certainly looked attractive. I had seafood pizza and I could not fault it. Staff very attentive, friendly and remembered our drink preference from last evening. Will be returning again, perhaps a lunchtime burger by the pool. Not sure I agree with new halal kitchen, as I would have liked Carbonara, but not with turkey bacon

Our family visited grand Mercure to celebrate Mother's Day today . We have heard about fine dining here . And being a halal one . That's not much choice in sg. But I guess it's the best choice ! :) We enjoyed a 4-5 course meal, the food was excellent from start to finish . Cooked to perfection , we filled our bellies and finished off with Desert that was very delicious . For the prices that we payed . I think it's worth every cent . Even more . Kudos to the Chef for being understanding as my Wife couldn't take the main course . He changed the main course just for her. 5 star service .

A good place to retreat to after the bustle of Singapore. The bar/restaurant is tucked away and quiet, and so it's a great place for a quiet meal with friends and family. Although the menu is limited in Asian fare, the western or international fare is fine. We ordered the hamburger and the steak. Both were good. The service is attentive and the house wine is good
