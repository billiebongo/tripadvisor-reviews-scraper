Came here twice and I found the fried oyster very nice here. It’s a must to try when you’re in Singapore.

Other than Fried Oyster, the Fried Carrot cake and Fried Kwey Tiao is heavenly. For non spicy eaters, go easy on the chili. it's really hot!

Fried Oyster is common in Singapore and you can find more than one stall selling it in this Bedok North Fengshan Market. But this tall just has the extra feel when you eat. It is like an extra heat, extra fire and extra warm. It just give you the extra delicious feel and make you feel to come back

Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our "go to" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality and this was one of those places that didn't have any such advertisements but the quality was definitely there.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the "Wok Hei" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours balanced very well and the Wok Hei was more prominent than most hawkers, it was beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.We also always order their Oluak aka Oyster Omelette which has a mix of just cooked oysters in a omelette with garlic and chives which is dipped in chilli sauce. Although I do enjoy the version of Oluak here, there is a place that does it with an extremely crispy finish, that's hard to go past. We never miss ordering it though, as I'm a sucker for a good Oluak and it goes great with the Kway Teow.It may take a little time to fine a seat at the Bedok Block 85 North complex where the food hall is situated but there is plenty to choose from whilst there and it's worth the wait. The chicken wings from the store next door are good, as is the two stalls around the corner that sit side by side to each other that serve Bak Chor Mee aka pork noodles. Just check out my other posts at Bedok Block 85 North for more information on the food available in the same complex.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore and I've been to this exact store when there was a time it didn't have the flavour of the wok. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and on this occasion there was plenty to wrap my mouth around and we will definitely be back.Cheers!Dave
