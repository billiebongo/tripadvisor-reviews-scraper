There's lots to love about this restaurant...great location, happy hour drinks/deals, range of cheese, fresh ingredients, good portion size, good value and consistently good food...which is a rare find in Singapore!

Went here with a bunch of friends. Restaurant was accommodating for separate checks. Service prompt. Food was much better than we expected- nice fresh salads, good thin crust pizza and the bill was reasonable.

This place lacks visibility. We barely noticed the sign when walking along the river edge. But the name sounded good enough for us to stop and look.The helpful staff person explained the menu - she suggested the 3-stage order: cheese choice, vegetable choice, meat (small goods) choice. We took her advice and she was quite correct. Having said that, I was not so keen on the mozzarella, but I really liked the vegetables and also the meat selection

D.O.P Mozzarella Bar & Restaurant Located at #01-04a / 60 Robertson Quay. The Quayside, Singapore. There are abundance of great Italian restaurants in Singapore... so I feel knowledgeable to say the D.O.P Mozzarella Bar & restaurant is an absolutely fabulous place to spend an evening. As its name implies, the restaurant prides itself on buffalo mozzarella from the owner’s hometown of Campania, where cheeses are made according to strict production rules that comply with the Consortium for the Protection of Buffalo Mozzarella., DOP from Campania. Also the menu has large selections of Appetizers, salads, homemade pasta such as ravioli, & gnocchi, Pizza, and offcourse desserts. The food is authentic Italian with some of the ingredients being flown out from Italy regularly. Great selection of wines. About the service and atmosphere also get really high marks, it is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. The owner Luca Iannone personally checks and greets each table to make sure your experience, Is as perfect as possible. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I have been here several times and didn't have a bad meal once. . Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back again. Highly recommended

The sincere relation to the guests and the food served is so genuine. Luca and his staff is always attentive and service minded. This also goes for the kitchen under the lead of Andrea. Here there is never a compromise on the quality of ingredients. Always the best!It is still, after many visits over the last year to this hidden gem, a pleasure and enjoyment to visit D.O.P. Don’t miss this place

This is supposed to be a restaurant that values high quality produce. Maybe so, but they fail to make anything good with it.Having read some good reviews, I decided to go with the lasagne which can be a bit of a gamble in some restaurants. This one disappointed majorly. It was soggy, bland, and the pasta was overcooked to mush. It waa soaked in tomato sauce, but I ate half of it only due to hunger desperation. Their bruscetta was also poor - hint: just a small drop of olive oil will prevent it drying up totally when toasted.I would have mentioned the above to staff but they never bothered to check up on me. The food not being completely disgusting prevents the lowest grade.Wont try again as there are very many other good places nearby. Arrivederci

Was Walking along the Riverside,with nowhere particular in mind ,and picked this place. They were still serving food,a lot of places had stopped even though it was only 10pm. Very good Waiter. Food was piping hot and very nice and the White Wine was Spot On. Exactly what we were afte

Have been away for the last four weeks however this being our first night in Singapore and subsequently our first meal in the country.Ordered the Mozzarella ball (singular) as a starter. Absolutely no flavour, was cold in the middle and when I cut it open what can only be described as water leaked out of it. Ironically enough it had the taste of water. Also ordered the bruschetta, again very bland and very forgettable,For our mains we had the lasagne which was OK, at least it was cooked, came out very hot. I had the homemade scialatielli, what a waste of my calorie intake for the day. Eating out of a cheese bowl simply doesn't work and nor does it mask such a terrible dish. Worst part is we didn't get asked once how the food was. The staff were quick to ask if we wanted more wine or more water between every mouthful but not once did they ask how the food was. Quickly paid up and left. Our dining experience in Singapore can only get better from here

This place lives up to its name, great range of cheese. Drinks list is good , happy hour deals are great. Worth a stop as you wander along the river..
4
The restaurant is set back from the walkway but still has views. Prices are reasonable and food is good. Happy Hour was good - recommend the Aperol Spritz.
5
This restaurant is quite informal, but the food quality is quite reliable. Very good antipasti. The mozzarella and Burrata are fantastic. Decent wines at reasonable prices (for local standards). Friendly service.
4
Food was very good and reasonably priced by Singapore standards. The staff was friendly and professional. All and all I was please and had a very pleasant dining experience
3
the Mozzarella and food in general is great if not fantastic and great daily specials to choose from with prices on the higher side.
The place is heavily understaffed as most places in Singapore which I rated it only 3 stars as it got annoying.
5
This restaurant offers decent service and definitely a great parmaham pizza. Wine is also pretty good. On the expensive side if you are used to European pizza and wine prices but nothing out of the ordinary for Singapore. Would surely recommended this Italian.
5
A very generous portion of beautiful buffalo mozzarella - milky, tender, and mild - layered with sweet Roma tomatoes topped with basil and oregano and garnished with the most beaming Castelvetrano olives. Enjoyed with unfussy, olive-oil drenched focaccia and a 7 SingDollar Aperol Spritz.

I ordered the homemade Gnocchi which I can't fault, it was so simple yet so good! Mummy got ravioli which she enjoyed and the others got truffle pasta served in a cheese wheel, which they didn't enjoy very much. Kate said the pasta itself was nice and they both agreed that the novelty of the cheese wheel was cool but very wasteful. Daddy just plain out said that his was awful. The service was okay however they did forget mummy's diet coke but thankfully they didn't charge us. The seating & environment wasn't anything special. I really enjoyed my food so i would eat their again, but it's not a good meal when others don't enjoy their food so hopefully it was just down to unlucky ordering. Overall for me it was an average eat.

Not written a review on trip advisor before despite travelling all over the world. But thought you should be aware of the two human hairs in the lasagne I was served. When I pointed it out they said they had no one in the kitchen with long dark hair these were two short hairs and the two chefs had short dark hair and no hair nets or hats, you make your mind up! But I will be avoiding this place as there are so many good alternatives on Robertson Quay!
5
Right up there with the best Italian food I have ever eaten. No booking however, made to feel welcome on a busy Saturday night. Owner even provided us with an Aperol each on the house. Good size meals, great atmosphere. Would go back next time without a doubt. Sambuca with coffee beans to finish off was a treat too
5
This is our go to place at Robertson Quay as they consistently serve good food. Service is also friendly and prices are very reasonable.

Worth a trip down the river if you are in CQ. Was unfortunate to visit during Eid holiday when a lot of ingredients were missing but still able to eat some great food and wine. Brilliant staff and would visit again

If you love cheese, this is a perfect place for you! We do, and we love the food! The smoked burratina and the homemade scialatielli stood out. The service was friendly and we had a great birthday celebration there!
5
Great food as always... enjoyed their special Tagliatelle Lamb Ragu .... the best we have eaten by far and the pizza crust is just crusty and yummy.
5
Well we know Fabio 18 years and Luca the owner of DOP probably 15 years. Great family of restaurantuers. We wend DOP for usual 11am weekend drinks and some prosciutto. Very busy place. And when start weekend brunch 10am then please make reservations ! But really, we don't know the Italian for home, is it CASA ? Anyway this and Lemoncello are fav places in Singapore.$ 7 for beer wine prosecco CANT GO WRONG.Now can I finally get a free drink!CiaoAdrian Jess Jade

One of the best restaurants in Robertson quay. Service is exceptional. Ingredients are top quality. Menu is carefully chosen. I've yet to try something I haven't loved. Great wine selection, bringing some of Italy's finest. Oh and the mozerallas are the best in all of Singapore. And once again the service is fantastic.
5
D.O.P just became one of my top favorites in Singapore. In a place like Singapore where the quality of the service is difficult to find.. DOP staff is absolutely perfect. Full of suggestions and attentions without being overwhelming during the meals! The food is absolutely delicious and taste fresh.. All this without paying absurd bill at the end of the meal! Well done guys and don't forget me.. I'll be coming back soon :

Strolling around Robertson Quay, we did not have Italian on our mind but the tables lined up alongside the river and nice evening Breeze made it a compelling combination. The area around the restaurant is u forgoing renovation and hence the tables were set alongside the river. Just as well:-)The menu is simple and and is 3 pages including desserts and beverages. So food if only across 2 pages. I liked the simplicity here. We orders D.O.P mozzarella priced at S$28. It's an ensemble of 3 elements type of cheese, salad and cold cuts that you can choose from a list. And a vegetarian folded tortilla wrap. This was okay. Didn't stand out. But paired with wine and a nice ambience it was overall a nice experience. Some staff was new and restaurant pretty full so we had to go inside to pay the bill. The inside was small and busy but courteous service always is the cherry on the cake for me. Some pics of the inside for you.. (sorry not too many as I usually do
5
It was the best picks for dinner, wide wine selections, priced reasonably. Large selections of cheeses and dry meat (deli). Awesome ambience with excellent service. A must try cold cuts which includes a homemade organic burrata, I've never tasted a cheese that great. Consider us being world traveler, I'd definitely give them a 10 if you wish to savor authentic homemade Italian cuisine !
4
The restaurant is good. We deliberately chose a Sunday afternoon in order to avoid the crowds. The food was good. We ordered all vegetarian, but perhaps the pizza could have been tastier. The pasta we ordered was salted beyond normal, so that's the reason for a lower than five-star rating.
4
My repeat visit to this restaurant. Every visit is just as good. Service is always friendly and very accommodating. Food and drinks is great too. Atmosphere is rated average only because of renovations work that's going on during this visit.
5
Lucca has done it again. Squid ink tagliolini with clams and crabmeat in white wine is simply out of this world. Ingredients were fresh and clams were juicy as you peel them from their shells. Spaghetti carbonara was an Italian job. Best lah
5
D.O.P Mozzarella Bar & Restaurant serves really authentic Italian cuisine, the highlight of our dinner was the create your own antipasto board and the house pour white wine. For the quality that we got, the prices are really reasonable.
4
Renovations in the area so the atmosphere was great . Once it's done though should lift up the vibes.Service was exemplary and the food was good in presentation and taste .
5
Rob quay is full of overpriced / ok quality or low price / rubbish. this place is reasonable in terms of price with excellent food and a quality wine list to suit most budgets.
3
The food was decent. We did not realize that there was a renovation above the restaurant (tiny indoor space). We took outdoor seats instead being assured construction had ended. On Friday at 7pm, there was still construction carts moving up and down in front of us. Best to return after the condo facade renovation is completed
4
The very friendly waiter Joe recommended the signature cheese and helped us choose the antipasto platter which was delectable. I had the special of the day Linguini with clams which was cooked al dente and much to my liking! My friend had the sea bass which was done just right and not overcooked. We ordered a bottle of the house red which was full bodied at reasonable price. The service was great too which made the overall experience there a very pleasant one.
5
Took my girlfriend to D.O.P. Mozzarella Bar for Valentine's Day and it was great. Food was amazing, especially the truffle pasta. I'm a personal fan on the spicy clams as well. Best part about the whole thing was the price. I was expecting a huge bill at the end, but was reasonably priced even though we ordered wine. Service was great too, the manager is super friendly and always checks up on you
4
We visited the place with high recommendation from peers on their cold cuts and pasta.Had our early Valentines there and boy we were glad we did.Left the choices for the cold cuts to the manager and it arrived speedy and beautifully. If we were a bigger group, I could have ordered a second round but the portion was adequately prepared too.We had decided against pasta and tried out their pizza, though it tasted alright.Service was friendly and sincere. Although the only wait staff could be a little inadequate on product knowledge, but we could feel that he was eager to catch up and smile whenever he could, and it was ok. We had tried to explore further than the pizza, but the manager halted us and advised the current order was perfect for 2. And he was right and we were very grateful.Trying to locate the restaurant could be a challenge if you take the wrong turn as the place was undergoing some construction, but we could feel that it would be breezier as the hoarding gets removed.Carparking in the basement could be a challenge with many pillars and tight turns. Bigger vehicles may need to park elsewhere.Overall, we were very happy with the dinner choice and restaurant. We had many bad experience with businesses tended by Europeans on the island, but as we walked in to this one, we felt welcomed and appreciated as the rest of the customers.We will certainly be back to savour more of their food and perhaps add this to our list of usual hangouts

We came to D.O.P Mozzarella midweek with some friends and had a lovely night. The happy hour drinks were good and reasonable in price and the food was also very lovely. The Atmosphere was a classy casual and very conducive to chatting with friends over drinks and dinner.

Went there on our first night.
Ordered the pizza with ham - $24
Went back for the Margarita - $15
On my last nights.
Located near Studio M

The dishes were very good. Appetisers were excellent and we really enjoyed the food. Great Service!!

Great place, with amazing food, and friendly and gentle service.
Owner Luca is very kind and caring.
Food is delicious, from antipasti
to desserts.
Great place to go and enjoy food.
5
It is always a pleasure to visit Luca and his staff at the DOP. Fantastic food which are always prepared with great care. The ingredients are mainly from Italy and always fresh and tasty. All dishes we have tried have been truly prepared the italian way. Try the frittura, the pizza, the mozarella platters, or the T-bone steak for example and you will understand what I mean. Also a nice place for drinks. The ambient is relaxing and friendly and the staff is alert. Don't miss this pearl

Ate here Saturday, beautiful food but the owner put a roasting plate in front of me with no warning, ended up with a bad burn on my finger and a ruined shirt, when I suggested maybe he could take the service charge off my bill, he agreed and took the original receipt from me and took 50% of the charge off instead. We are talking about $7.50 here but a cheap lesson in trust, never go back !
4
Went to D.O.P. for dinner and it was a good surprise. The mozzarella platter - with the vegetables and cold cut - is good, very reasonnably priced and quite large.Dishes that we tried after - Pasta with bolognese and others - were simple but well executed.Service was good too.Overall a very good experience with "good to very good" food for a very reasonnable price
5
This is Italian cooking as it should be done! I was bowled over by the creaminess, richness and melt-in-your-mouth Mozzarella sharing plate. Everything was incredibly fresh, portions were ample and a Prosecco to start with hit the spot. The highlight of the meal for me, and I can't recommend it highly enough, was the signature homemade Scialatielli pasta with cacio cheese and black truffle - this was heaven in a bowl! I could have eaten this twice over... The wine list is very good, service excellent and the owner, Luca, is charming. I would definitely add this to my regular dining out list
5
We had dinner here on a weeknight after chancing upon the restaurant on a website, and it turned out to be a lovely experience. We ordered the smoked burratina with sauteed eggplant and a generous serving of parma ham; deep-fried mozzarella; and the homemade scialatielli - all of which tasted fresh and delectable. The Prosecco and Pinot Grigio served were good and affordably-priced too. We were too stuffed to try any desserts but we will do so when we return, and we definitely will. Lastly, thumbs up for the attentive and excellent customer service
5
Mr Iannone's personal attention and innovation can be felt and tasted in this restaurant. Portions are well presented and the typical dishes seem to have a added quality and style to them. We got acquainted with his previous restaurant in our neighbourhood and became a frequent visitor. This was our first visit to DOP Mozarella and we were very well delighted. Highly recommended
5
This is my second visit in 2 weeks. I first ate here with 11 colleagues after a workshop. The food was delicious and the wine priced very reasonably. The service is the "understated" but thoroughly attentive type. It made such an impression on me that I brought my dad and brother's family and my kids to the restaurant on a public holiday for lunch (usually not opened on weekdays for lunch). Starters were devoured down by old and young alike - love the wind dried beef with grilled vege and buratta in truffle oil. Kids had calamari and prawns for starters, and for mains lasagne, aglio olio and the special melted caciocavallo pasta - all finished their portions and were unwilling to share! Adults had squid ink pasta, Iberian collar and steak - delicious as well. For dessert, we ran out of stomach space, and shared a tiramisu and a the lemon almond cake (forgot its menu name) between 4 adults - both are winners - lemon almond cake was served warm with cream flavoured with some alcohol - tiramisu was very good too.. the type that is not too sweet, just right with the right amount of flavour, cocoa and sponge. Definite recommend
