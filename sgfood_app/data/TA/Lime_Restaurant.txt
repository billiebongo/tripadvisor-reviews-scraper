the staff number was so insufficient that even getting a glass of water takes 30 mins. selection of food fantastic for CNY eve dinner either
4
The food at this restaurant was good. The Satay stick starter I had was actually very good. I chose from the menu rather than the buffet. The service was quite good but admittedly the restaurant was not busy.
4
Should have more variety of food, as the choices a quite limited. But the services is good and outlay is nice
4
Modern spacious restaurant.
More choices for local fare vs western, satay is good. Limited dessert spread, durian paste is very good
4
I love the carrot cake that is served in the afternoon tea set! Cuteness overload and taste great too! I couldn’t focus on my business meeting. Haha

Went for their dinner buffet on a weekday, not too busy. But what struck me was the number of tables that are meant for a big group of guests while couples like us have limited choice of seats. We were seated next to a big group of ladies, which I don’t mind. But come on, we would like to enjoy our meal without eight pairs of eyes looking over at our table every now and then.Food choices is very limited. Sashimi and sushi was great, dessert was not too bad. Others are just average. For the money we paid, I would rather spend it on other buffet restaurants
5
The place is amazing. We were a group of 7 and they gave us a spacious table. Tables were not too close to each other, which gave everyone the privacy for small chats. Buffet spread was great with a wide variety of international and local cuisine. Seafood was very fresh as well. Some action station for us to make our own food. We were there for our team Christmas dinner and everyone had a good time! Will definitely go back there again
4
Ambience is great for couple and great for gathering. The lightings can be quite dim though but rather romantic feel. For the price, it is quite pricey and the spread can be improve but quality of the freshness of the food is good! The fresh Oyster is not very big and plum but it is definitely fresh. But was a bit disappointed with the dessert in terms of taste. I love the free flow of tea and the very excellent service of the staff!

My husband and I chose to celebrate Christmas Day with a dinner at Lime Restaurant. And it was fabulous! It was within easy reach of bus number 33 or 2 from our hotel in Bras Basah, and the setup was superb. A big fountain of matcha chocolate fountain and sweet goodies beckons one to come in, and the food was displayed in such an appetising manner. My husband was delighted at the Christmas roasts that they had in offer, while I indulged myself in their fresh seafood entrees. The cheese selection was superb, too!When we come back to Singapore, we surely will come back to Lime Restaurant
4
Booked a table for my boss’s birthday and he was quite pleased with the variety of food available. The savoury dishes were especially well done, like the salmon, mac and cheese and pre-mixed salads. Dessert fell a bit flat though, everything was too sweet or sour - not enough nuance. But for $50/head for lunch this place is very value for money
4
A nice place, filled with natural light.
The entrance is nicely decorated, filled with botanical feel (suits the hotel image/theme).
The varieties was not much, but food quality still acceptable.
The beef and dessert tasted not bad.
3
Food was ok. Hit and miss for the savoury version.
The Ayam percik shepherd pie was nothing but just flour. Could not taste any chicken in it
Ordered satay however satay was warm and not hot
5
Food selection is very good and the taste is superb.One thing notice that theirs no rice on the display however one of the Waiter name June did the extra mile to get rice for me.It was really good feeling that they care of their customer even though they are super busy.Thanks for thatAlso one of the server name Kexin is attentive and always willing to serve.Good Job and thanks a lot for everything.We did enjoyed our dinner.
5
Christmas lunch buffet out of this world, so much great food to pick from, I mean it was endless, great drinks, the staff were absolutely wonderful, we had the best time at Lime 10 out of 10, from us, will 100% go back next time in Singapor
5
Seafood was fresh & delicious but what really impressed me is the impeccable service. Service with a smile is rare these days. But at Lime Restaurant, June & Vita really made our day! Very warm & friendly, their service was top notch! We were so impressed.Chinese chef Jia Kong also went the extra mile to get us condiments that were not readily available.Also thanks to Ryan for finding us an amazing seat, we really wanted the privacy to celebrate our wedding anniversary.It's been a wonderful dining experience, we will definitely be back
5
The selection of food was so good! It was indeed special and everyone was served a very nice lime cocktail drink that was complimentary. Overall wonderful experience and food was all on point. Despite the huge selection, there was no compromise on quality. Absolutely well don. Thank you
4
A nice place for makan. Be it on business or personal. Nice ambience with large variety of foods for selection. From sushi to laksa, pastries and Nonya style of kueks.. Served with a glass of lime juice to go with the meal as well. Lunch going from S$60++ per pax and dinner from S$80++ per pax on their buffet spread. A great place with spacious seating plan within the restaurant
1
We came weekday 3 PM for the tiers of joy high tea for 2. The high tea was average and quite small portion, so I ordered satay. We waited 25 minutes, and noticed a plate of satay at the counter for the last 10 minutes, which we suspect was ours. When I asked them to check my order, turns out that plate WAS ours, so it arrived cold. The satay sauce miserably thin, so I asked for more. Once again it look them 5-7 minutes but the sauce came back watered down and very diluted. The waiters/waitresses were indifferent and just stood around without proactively offering to top-up drinks (we had unlimited coffee/tea). Very disappointed with the quality given the good reviews. Will not come again

Last year, I missed its xmas brunch as I m on a long wait list due to its well-recd popularity! this year I thought I m in for a surprise by Santa! Sadly it wasn't the case...the poor steamed fish was drenched with (droplets of) water due to its steaming method(probably) and it was not exactly cooked - this is a strict NO for meI don't find its seafood-be it deep fried ((softshell crab) or wok-fried(chilli/pepper crab), was at its supreme freshness toobut the Whole Baked Christmas Spice Salt Crust Salmon was fresh for sure...(great way to re introduce the ancient way of cooking for xmas period) the rice steamed in lotus leaf was a not-bad surprise but for that pricing, I do expect a decency on freshness and quality! but I admit Seared Foie Gras Flambéed with Cognac is decent (however still lack of a cognac taste as it claimed?(LIME Signature Laksa with Slipper Lobster (the meat of the slipper lobster is just one tiny bit)the beef is just ok, didn't have a melt-in-your-mouth feel though it is quite tenderOh ya, the ONLY consolation I could comfort myself is gorge myself down with the durian pengat (a peranakan dessert)(generally those items in the dessert dept fare quite ok in most hotels' F&b outlets)The ambience and décor needless to say is A-class! and the attention given by the wait staff is impeccable too.. However, when it comes to an F&B outlet, the weightage on food is heavier! w carol singing and spacious setting, I trust Lime can improve on its food in time to come esp having the need to take note of that during a peak festive perio
4
The ambience is good. High ceiling, spacious and abundance of natural light.The food is very good but not excellent. The Japanese section was sub-par. Sushi items looks messy, sashimi section was honestly poor in terms of perceived freshness. However, the restaurant makes up for it by having a generous spread of seafood dishes; oysters, scallops and tons of seafood. which makes up great value. One of the few restaurants dishing out lobsters as a buffet menu item, Lime has at least 4 different dishes featuring lobsters. There's a never-ending queue at the live-stations in the outdoor section of the restaurant offering grilled seafood. Service team was average and a little bit of warmth from them would ace this restaurant
4
The restaurant was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The seafood spread was good. The hot food section was average. Dessert was limited. It seems like the local dishes taste better than the western dishes.
5
Nice ambience with wide selection of food from seafood to dessert. Can't get enough of the desserts. WIll definitely revisit!!
5
Superb ambience, good food, excellent service! The buffet spread is reasonable but mad up by the quality of the food!
5
Wonderful lunch buffet spread. Food of good quality. Local and western. Cold seafood, sushi and limited Sahaimi. Some live stations like laksa and roast meats. Roast beef and pasta. Matcha fondue desert is nice. Highly recommended
3
Went for the “What the shell” buffet. Felt that the lobsters variety is too little and the lobsters are quite tough n not ask sweet as last year’s. Not sure if it’s the quality that’s lacking or this year’s lobsters are all like that.
5
Used the Eatigo app and got a 30 percent discount.Hotel is easily accessible, just a minute walk from Clarke Quay Exit A.I'm in love with the greenery and open kitchen concept (and green tea fondue) Was so tempted to eat desserts first! Appreciate the little DIY Xmas decor and mini pine tree at our table. Wished I could bring it home.Could have a wider variety of ice cream flavors. Noticed that some buffet labels were missing too.Overall excellent service crew and cleanliness
5
I had lunch at the restaurant on my last day in Singapore. I had been staying at the hotel and had enjoyed the lovely breakfasts. I had the lobster and crab risotto and it was absolutely delicious. The restaurant was very busy with the Christmas buffet that they were offering. So II was impressed that they could accommodate just myself and my simple order. The staff were very friendly and courteous. It is high quality food and would recommend it for something special
4
Visited as a group of 12 on a Friday evening, was greeted promptly at the entrance and brought over to our seats. The buffet was quite extensive and whilst not in the same league as Carousel or The Line, it was a lot less expensive than theirs and very good value. There were Irish oysters (abit small) and sashimi, but no lobsters. Prawns available in wide variety - drunken prawns, cold boiled prawns (recommended! sweet), and grilled prawns. Desert selection was wide too. Would come again with the 20% UOB promo
1
I had high hopes from this place after reading and hearing rave reviews about it, but I am terribly disappointed after eating here. Limited variety of food, only the dessert section was alright and tasted fine. The rest of the food including the seafood was hit and miss. The sashimi was OKAY, the chilled prawns wasn't very fresh. The oysters served were of a smaller size as well, my parents didn't even go for a second helping. The fried noodles were bland and lack of seasoning. The sausage (with cheese) was too salty as well. This is the first and the last time I will be dining here.However I would like to commend their service staff on their excellent service.Overall I do not recommend, do not waste your money here. I'd recommend Edge @ Pan Pacific ..your money is worth more there.
4
We had high tea there. Price was relatively cheap $42++ with a coffee and a tea for 2 pax. We love the savories and the scones though the clotted cream could be improved. There wasnâ€™t many people as it was a weekday and I enjoyed the tranquility. I will revisit to try out their Super Sunday brunch the next time
3
Most of the meals are buffet style. The buffet foods were not always warm like they should have been. The presentation was very nice. We did order off the menu and the food was very tasty!
4
My mom and I were shopping in the vicinity and wanted to rest our legs. We popped by Lime to enquire about high tea at around 4pm and the staff looked doubtful because this popular tea set usually required reservations and is usually sold out. But, she asked us to wait while she went into the kitchen to check. Moments later, she appeared with a bright smile and 2 thumbs up indicating availability. We got the second last set! The tea set was a lovely sight and yummy too! All the staff who served us were warm and nice
1
Had a bad encounter 2 years back with the attitude of staff when making a reservation which subsequently choose another venue which probably was a correct decision then. Decided to give this place another chance when we made a reservation to celebrate my wife's birthday in Oct weeks back which turned out to be another huge disappointment!A half filled restaurant when we arrived on a Saturday evening speaks volume of how much this restaurant has dropped in terms of popularity. Food selection pretty much limited with below average quality. You could easily find much much valued for money buffet elsewhere easily with their pricing offered. Service was not attentive with reminders needed when they forgotten the coffee orders after 15mins and even missed out totally the arrangement of the slice of birthday cake to be served which was supposed to be the highlight of the family dinner for family photo opportunity. When sharing the feedback while making payment was given excuses after excuses from the team to cover their incompetency and lacked of floor supervision.A totally waste of time and a shame with how this once much raved about buffet restaurant from years ago has fallen.
3
Food at Lime was pretty good although the variety was pretty limited. They had the general selection of cold to cooked seafood which most buffet restaurants have to offer. The outdoor bbq had only 4 selections of seafood(prawns, scallop, shishamo, oysters). There were some dishes which were interesting such as the lobster laksa and seafood bouillabaisse that were both packed with flavour. Service was excellent and the range of dessert was astounding. I'm satisfied with my first time there but I would not return to it anytime soon unless they have something better to catch my eye( and mouth hehe 
1
I went to Lime for Saturday dinner due to good reviews but really disappointed after having my meal there. Not much cooked food. Varieties limited. Roasted beef hard to bite; laksa gravy tasted blend; fried noodles not nice; pandan chicken with 'Mediterranean' flavour (!!!); Chinese Rojak 油条so hard to bite; Chinese herbal soup not strong herbs tasted; raspberry ice-cream left not much & has became 'rock' , can't even scooped at all !!!. The only commendable food is the seafood chowder soup & the western pastries. Staff service is good & restaurant has nice ambience. $72 ++ per pax is not worth for this type of food. With this price, can have lobster at a 5* hotel. Will not come back again
2
I and my brother went there for high tea. Everyhing was beautiful until I finished my first cup of tea. I was trying to make eye contact with the waiters to ask for refill. I'm quite a soft-spoken person, so I don't call them, just wave my hand few times. But there's no result for +-3 minutes although there's always waiters on the counter. The persons beside my table had their own teapot, so they don't need to call them. Luckily, I don't have to go through that again for my third cup, just a minute staring at them. The scones were great, the other food was not remarkable, the tea was good, the service ruined it for me. The frustration to get someone to recognize you for 3 mins is not what I pictured a relaxing afternoon tea is about. If that's the standard of service there, I'll make sure to bring a bell next time, which won't be in the near future
5
We were there for a Thursday night for the Seafood Buffet. Service staff that attended to us were very efficient, nice and friendly. The food was superb as well.There were lots to choose from. My favourite were the Oysters, Lobster Laksa, Salmon Sashimi and Grilled Lobsters with Hollandaise Sauce. The dessert line was also amazing. Definitely worth a visit to this place if you're looking for high-end buffet to treat yourself
5
As a Lobster and Seafood Fanatics, I am very contented and satisfied with this Shell Buffet promotion. Very, very to my liking and my friend and I enjoyed our dinner very much. Staff were all very helpful and friendly. But if can reduce the price slightly lower, it will be so much better. I will be back again - love the Salted Bake BBQ prawn and Laksa Lobster very muc
4
Myself and 7 of my colleagues went for Friday lunch. Restaurant ambience is good. Lot of variety. Sushi bar and seafood is fresh. Almost they covered all variety, Chinese, Indian, western, cheese bar, dessert, Malay kueh, salad bar, satay Laksa etc etc..customer service is good. Good meal ended with flat white.
3
Limited selection on main dishes as for the Lime-light monday (semi-buffet). Ala carte menu mains have way more dishes to choose from, was disappointed. Great quality TWG teas, not hot enough as it was pre-brewed in vacuum flask. Selection includes; live rösti (was abit oily but yummy, original was good), self-made rojak station, gourmet cheese, bread (fluffy chewy breads with excellent butter) station, salad station (fresh veggies), sushi rice station with unagi slices, matcha fondue station (too sweet) no fruits, got cookies, meringue, marshmallow, jelly beans and puff, desserts (mainly tarts, quite tasty). Small selection vs price. Comfortable seats (round table of 4 pax with half round sofa + 2 seats) Service was good, polite and patient.
3
The restaurant has nice ambience but the choice of food is limited for the price of the buffet and the waiter/waitress seems inexperienced.
4
Food selection is ok. Though seafood selection is limited, oysters and prawns are fresh. Unique flavoured chocolate -Matcha fountain.
3
Was celebrate my girlfriend birthday dinner at here yesterday night. Nice environment, food still ok, for me, l think not much variety. Price affordable.
4
We arrived very late for dinner, the kitchen was closed, but the barman tried to get us a meal and managed to get exactly what we wanted (most of all, I am a vegan so it was quite complicated).
Thanks !
4
Staff was attentive, introduced the buffet selection, provides great service. The ambience of the restaurant was relaxing too. Enjoyed the food selection of their buffet spread where most of the food i tasted was deliciious
5
Was there for buffet lunch with business partners.
Good place to chill, Well-appointed furnishings, feels unpretentious yet classy.
Regular food selection - seafood (oysters served only at night) and sashimi etc. at rather reasonable pricing.
Would revisit with families for dinner buffet.
5
It was a company sponsored dinner for a summit meeting. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening with great food and drinks. Huge variety of food to choose from. There are corners for Japanese, Indian, western, sea food and local food. Sea food corner was awesome with freshest clams ever. Live laksa station is something to rev about. Indian food was a bit sad and needs some enhancements. Desert selection was awesome too
4
My partner and I ate the buffet breakfast at Lime which will set you back around $35 pp. There was great choice and the food appeared fresh and tasty! Chefs were there to cook omelettes and eggs any way you liked. There was also a great selection of noodles, Japanese cuisine and bakery items. Only criticism is the food wasn't always hot...:( overall great food and something for everyone
3
Was there for high tea with 2 other friends as we happened to be around Chinatown area.There was 2 pricing for the High tea - $45 or $48 (with unlimited serving of either coffee and tea) for 2.The food was average and service was a bit lacking. There wasnt a lot of customers as it was on a weekday but had to keep waving to get the server to top up the drinks.There are better places for high tea
5
We are a family of fussy eaters and Lime is our go-to Sunday brunch spot in Singapore. Fab array of cuisines without being overly fussy. For me, a relaxing weekend brunch is when everyone in my family is happy! As they serve until 4:30 you can go later and miss the crowds and still have plenty of time to eat, drink and relax. Options for cuisine including local/Peranakan, Sushi, Salads, Indian, Western, etc. Plus cheeses, nuts and desserts to die for. Fresh juices, ice creams and a matcha chocolate fountain.They bring around a Sangria cart which isn't my thing though it's very cool looking. Food is always fresh and staff is very kind and friendly. Food tips: Roti prata takes a crazy-long time so order and return for it after a while. You can try your hand at mixing your own Rojak, the local fruit/veg/peanut salad. The building and interior is a spectacular modern design with an eco twist. After a few hours of eating we like to walk from there either through Fort Canning or the other way to Chinatown. Call ahead and request a table by the window
5
Went here for few times, it wasn't bad.They have pretty good selections for the Buffett for breakfast and we loved it. For the high tea, it was pretty decent for the reasonable price. Ambiance was very relaxing too. Will recommend it to everyone.
5
This is my 4th visit to The Lime. It never fail me with good food and excellent service. Thumbs up 👍
2
I went for dinner during National Day, restaurant was not really full.. the selection of cold food was very limited and the hot food quality was quite disappointing even the durian that was serve outside. But the service was very attentive, well done!
3
The spread is limited although their desserts are quite good. Service is good provided it's not peak period.
3
Came here with my fiancee on 10 August, Thursday. This was our first time here. I would like to specifically compliment Ms Sha and Mr Li-Chung, who are the waitress and waiter of this restaurant respectively. Their attentiveness to our needs made our maiden visit here enjoyable. Care should be by taken when noting your customers' names (My name was spelled wrongly). We were impressed by the quality of food and durian, but the selection of food was really limited. Desserts were delicious.It seems that the management has not thought through on how to handle customers with carry-ons, for example, bags. My fiancee and I had to either carry our bags or leave our bags aside on our seats while we were eating. This made us quite uncomfortable. We also observed other customers with similar situation, experienced the same thing as us. If the restaurant could provide a bag stand for us, it would be great. I also found it funny when Ms Sha told us she could not provide us an additional chair for our bags as "it was full house" when in actual fact, most tables and chairs around us were empty then.Not really a fantastic place to have your hunger fixed for dinner unless you want to taste the desserts and durians
5
Had a wonderful buffet with my classmates to celebrate our completion of our masters. The restaurant has a nice ambience with good food and service. The setting of the area is very nice. Had eaten a lot! Today was the durian fiesta where we can get to eat durian! With all the good food, I'll definitely be back! Btw, i was able to get complimentary parking ticket
1
It's been a year since I was back at Lime Restaurant but this time round for the durian buffet. I must say it was pretty well-planned by the restaurant. I would not go into the "standard" buffet food - since it's pretty much the same across the different restaurants with the same international buffet offering. What really stood out for me here were the cuisine that tied in with the durian theme. If you have had durians before, you know its strong (or pungent - if you hate them) taste/smell, so it is not the easiest to pair with savoury foods. The chefs tried and I think they did a decent job of doing so, except for the durian "prata" which I felt was a shoddy recreation of a local cuisine. Otherwise, the rest were worth the calories. Also, the management got a push cart - placed right outside of the restaurant, to serve the all-time favourite of D24 and Mao Shan Wang durians. Very old-school, very local, yet tastefully done with a staff on hand to help you pry the durian open. They provide gloves and hand sanitiser as well but who eats durians with gloves???All-in-all, the food was good. But the staff, horrid as compared to my last experience. My friends and I were there for dinner on 23 Jul 2017. When we approached the counter, the restaurant manager said that they would sit all the guests at the same time. Since we were early and registered, we felt no need to form a queue outside of the restaurant. Some other diners came and a line started to snake and by then we realised that we would not be seated because we registered earlier, we had to join the queue. My friends and I felt cheated since the instruction was not clear. Later on during the dinner, the same manager - in a very rude tone and brutish, approached one of his staff and started reprimanding him, right in front of us - the guests! I have never encountered such an incident and I felt bad for the staff in fact. The hotel management should do better to train their leaders to be effective communicators and to learn to lead instead of direct. Poor service. Hence, the bad review. No matter how good the food is and its quality, poor service and staff management spoils it all
4
Went there for the Durian buffet. The durain inspired dishes are great, but top up is slow. The Management should look into this area as your guests are mainly there for it. Price is high @ $88++ per pax and no bank card discount.Service from this particular staff (Sha) is great
3
We came here for dinner but we felt disappointed as there wasnt any vegetarian food on dinner buffet. So i ordered pasta from ala carte menu while my bf stick with buffet. The pasta taste so so.must wait quite long time to get it. After dinner my bf get sick because his allergy of gluten arise. He asked one of ur waiter/cook if the food used wheat flour & they said no. Seem your waiter/cook didnt know well the ingredient & recklessly anwered my bf question. He felt bad headache til next morning which ruined our night & our plan at next morning.We never come back here again
4
For $80 per pax, one would expect the quality of the food to great. Overall, i did enjoy my meal but i believe that the cold seafood could do better in terms of variety i.e crayfish, crabs and maybe lobsters?Moving on to what i recommend, diners should try the foie gras (a must!), poached egg, oysters and the sangria (you'll only get one drink at 1pm
5
Great spread. Excellent taste. Bright and wonderful interior. Perfect for couples and families as well.
4
Hotel ambience was good. Plenty of space for a hotel in the CBD. Tea set was nice - don't be fooled by the little pastries... They are more filling than they look.
4
The food is good. Especially on desert selection, the matcha and chocolate fondue is rarely seen anywhere else.
The service is good as well.
3
This high tea is great value st $48 for two people. The set was beautifully presented and everything tasted wonderful. The only downside which management need to address is that the restaurant staff were cleaning, vacuming and setting up tables around us which was very noisy and really disappointing.
1
My friends and I were rather excited about dining at this restaurant as it was our first time. Not only that, the buffet featured durians, our all-time favourite. We tucked in to the main spread within the restaurant while waiting for another friend to join us. Once all parties are present, we made our way to the outdoor area where there was supposedly "unlimited servings" of durians, we were only disappointed to learn that there was no durian left! While the manager did make a sincere effort to explain the situation to every patron (something about an issue with the supplier), to say that our moods were unaffected by this would be a lie. Not even the discount offered for our meals could assuage our disappointment. Having said that, kudos to the manager and to a serving staff, Fino who made the dining experience very lovely up to the point we did not savour our durians. We could only drown our sorrow with durian pengat
4
Excellent service from the crews to the chefs, they were very helpful and go the extra mile to clarify my enquiry. Wide selection of food choices but highlight were the ones with durian although there were some that did not even made any appearance after I checked a few times. Free flow durians have ran out and was only charged the regular buffet price after I highlighted this to the counter
4
There were so many different types of savoury and sweet items to try, most very good. This was not a traditional english cream tea like I have had back home, rather it had an asian twist. There was some kind of fish rice ball covered in peanuts with an anchovy on top which had an interesting taste. We really enjoyed the dessert side especially the scones with cream and jam and the passion fruit meringue cake. We were extremely full by the end as the flavours were strong. It cost 48 dollars for a tier which serves 2 with unlimited drinks. The staff were very nice and polite although we did wait around 35 minutes to be served. In the end it was worth the wait.

I was here as part of a family birthday lunch celebration recently. I have to admit that I had not heard of this restaurant prior to this visit but my first impressions were that the interior design was rather impressive - high ceilings, a long kitchen with intermediate islands amongst the seating areas, and long glass panels which let in plenty of natural light. Word of the restaurant must have spread fairly well as diners were there up to half and hour prior to opening time. The cuisine was predominantly Asian with a nice mix of Japanese, Indian and local dishes on offer. The desserts were justifiably popular. However, I have to admit that the overall quality of food wasn't that fantastic. Being a buffet, there's not much I can really say about the service of the staff although the chefs did a good job of keeping the food topped-up at regular intervals. I did interact with one of the servers (unfortunately, I don't recall his name) who was very friendly and engaging in conversation. If driving to the restaurant, there's more than adequate parking at the car park on the third and fourth storeys of the hotel which are easily reached by the elevators just outside the restaurant's entrance. Parking is, however, quite expensive so it's a good idea to ask the waiting staff if complimentary parking coupons are available
4
The Lime is part of the Parkroyal hotel - no wonder the architecture is something special. The restaurant has this open-kitchen concept. That means that there are basicsally different buffets with different kinds of food: chinese, italian pasta, local food, seafood, salads, indian treats and sweets. Everything we tried was delicious and freshly prepared altough for me as a vegetarian the available selection was not that wide
5
The pizzas at this restaurant are sublime. All are freshly cooked to order - we had the goat's cheese and spinach with a green salad - so fresh and crispy and the salad perfect. All washed down with a couple of ice cold beers and great background music
4
Food section was good except for the sashimi. The sashimi quality in freshness and taste seemed below average.
As the restaurant was quite long in length, the staff seemed spread out quite thin and service was average.
4
Loved this restaurant! The starters , main was fantastic ! The presentation of the al carte dishes was interesting but I reckon the desert at this restaurant was the best finish to the evening
4
the breakfast is very extensive from chinese, western, japanese and there fresh juice, vitagen, yakult, lots of yogurt to choose from..and lots of bakery to choose too..
4
Huge variety in cooking methods. But can have better variety in food. However, great service and environment.
4
the design of the hotel and restaurant is very modern, and the place has excellent ambience. sufficient spread of food, which all taste good. sadly there arent drinks selection! (i went for the lunch buffet)
4
Had breakfast twice at Lime with my partner, so gave it a pretty good test--it passed with flying colours!Firstly, the space is interesting. Really high ceiling, big windows out onto the roadside planting & park across the road, and a nice arrangement of cooking stations and different buffet counters groaning with food.Secondly, the staff are efficient. Tables are cleared & readied quickly, your used plates are quickly removed, & coffee & tea are on tap--you can by the way ask for expresso at no extra cost.Thirdly, & most importantly, the food. Its very good--a big selection spanning East & West, good quality, and a number of cooking stations in addition to the normal egg station where you can get things cooked.The highlights for us were the eggs benedict, the French breads & pastries, and the smoked salmon and cheeses. We ate less of the Asian dishes as we were after a change. The fresh fruit was good, you could get a range of fresh squeezed juices, & waffles if you want to be really indulgent.At $33 per head, pretty good value for Singapore, & definitely the way to set you up for a big day of either work or pleasure
4
Glad to have found this place. Great for big groups. We have 14+1 paxs. The tables were nicely spread out. Love the high ceiling and contemporary decor. The ambience was just lovely. I have heard comments from friends on the lighting being on the little dim side and I do agree with them totally.The wait staff assigned to our table was attentive and prompt. She cleared the dirty plates and top up the water promptly.The spread was good with the usual sashimi, oyster, sushi, pasta, Indian food, Peranakan food, western food and a decent dessert table. One highlight for me was the grilled lamb chops. First time seeing lamb chops at any buffet and boy they were good! The dessert table has a wonderful spread of cakes, meringue, franciers, tarts, etc. I felt that Lime should serve one or two regular flavours ice cream because what were available (black sesame, wasabi raspberry, Gula Melaka and one other which I can't remember) yesterday were not suitable for kids. My mum loves the restaurant so much that she was already planning to throw a small party there next CNY
5
Was there for a birthday celebration. This has got to be one of my favourite buffet lines, other being the line.The spread is interesting (as usual) with a nice balance between east and western cuisines. The focus was also quite decent as it seems to be more quality driven. :)Service wise, the cashier lady was very quick to offer a cake for my fren who was celebrating his birthday. That was quite a sweet move. My friend left with the cake thoroughly amused and charmed. :

Food SpreadYou get the feeling that there seems to be something missing. Despite having a Peranakan section, seafood, asian kitchen, pasta kitchen, the spread within each station was borderline stingy for the price you pay.Food QualitySeafood is fresh, albeit slow because you have to wait for the cook to get a tiny portion or for him to finish shucking the oysters.Asian Kitchen's meat (roast pork belly and roast duck) were dry! it felt like I was eating saw dust.The dessert spread was fairly generous but the cakes should be sliced instead of us having to do the slicing ourselves.Cheese spread has only got comtÃ© emmental and another blue cheeseService Service staff were generally friendly and accommodatingAtmosphereNothing less you would expect from a 5 star hotel

We were so excited with the breakfast buffet spread options! Display of the food and the taste of the food worth the try. Loved the dessert and pastries, especially the choco twist and custard cream puff. Last but not least, the personal touch from each and every hotel rep that makes the effort to introduce the individual station definitely won our heart. Will definitely pay a visit to the restaurant in the future. Kudos to all, Park Royal @ Pickering and Staffs from LIME Restaurant. :

Overall, our experience at Lime Restaurant is great. The staff were really helpful and friendly towards us. There was a large spread of food with a great ambiance. Recommended for special occasions!
5
Great customer service from the hotel staffs and very friendly..food was good, yet not good enough as they do not have a wide range of seafood choices..it was still a great experience at Lime restaurant with great service and ambience. Thank you.

There is so much scope in this restaurant - you can go for light meals or go for the real Macoy. Meals are well cooked and the flavours are exquisite.
5
Excellent service and food catering to both vegetarian and non vegetarian. Staff were helpful esp Prabu. 14 of us had a great time. Thanks much.
5
Cant complain anything about it. Everything there is just awesome! Highly recommended to all business meetings/lunches!

I ate a piece of rotten watermelon, and I could see other fruits color also turned darker (oxidization) the rock melon and honey dew. Myself and my wife were among the first few entered the restaurant at 12 noon. Did the fruit oxidise this fast? Or the fruit ... were kept in fridge for sometime already?
4
The buffet serves a variety of food from international to local food, service staffs were friendly and efficient. A relaxed place to meet up with friends and family. I hope they extend another 30mins of the operating hour for lunch instead of the current hour (12-2.30pm) for a more family friendly restaurant. I have infant with me therefore it will take me longer to have my meal.
4
Came for buffet dinner and the spread was simply good. From Fresh Seafood to Western, to Nyonya to Chinese food etc...most of the food tasted yummy.Service was average as you need to catch their attention when you need them. Something rather unusual when you visit the toilet though. There must be a reason why it's almost darkness in the cubicle.
4
Really extensive buffet with lots of lunch and dessert varieties. This is a large buffet and very comfortable. Although buffet finished around 2.30 we were not under any pressure to leave the restaurant which was nice as our group were catching up with each other after a couple e of years so had much to chat about. Pretty good value at around SGD60 all up per person
5
I was here for truffle mac n cheese only. I could say u guys have the best mac n cheese that comes w four piece of bread. It is really filling. I love the bar high chair area as it is very quiet during dinner buffet time despite the crowd. Will be back again or truffle mac n cheese :) Staffs are really attentive n polite
5
Excellent customer service and prompt service.
Many food choices without getting bored each day. Fresh fruit juices and amazing egg benedict.
4
Decent food spread but for the price, i expect better cold seafood spread !! No lobster or clayfish or flower crabs !! The ambiance is pretty dim !! The service was very good !! Dessert section good and the nonya section can improve for sure.
5
Thank you Ms. Jun Jun for a very good service. Such a memorable night for having dinner at lime restaurant, the environment and ambient is so perfect.
5
This is by far the best place to have an exquisite dinner in Singapore . Situated amidst a cbd, Park royal offers exclusive buffet ( if you're inclined to dine at a five star restaurant). I hope to visit soon ❤❤❤❤
5
It was an amazing experience to be in this restaurant, surely something one must do even if for a coffee.
5
They served a wide variety of food and they were all excellent. The service was prompt and the staff were polite.
4
$20 per glass for Tiger! Good food though and service was good too. The salmon sashimi was a little gristly in places.
5
The buffet selection is wonderful, prawns were really fresh and sashimi was freshly sliced.
The deserts were phenomenal and we can even request many kinds of tea at the end of the buffet meal.
4
The spread and choices of food was not great, but the quality was. Exception to the cold tea water that came in the teapot (of which was complimentary to our Buffet Dinner) and the not very tasty Red Velvet & White Chocolate Cake, the experience was a wonderful one.The staffs however were very very helpful, though I find them somewhat short-handed
5
This is one of those restaurants where the buffet is just endless and seems to cater to every whim. It's a great place for learning portion control, because I simply want to eat everything.However ... do avoid the coffee. It is simply appalling. I have not marked them down for this since so very few 5 star hotels anywhere get the coffee right. (Never quite understood this. they would never serve poor quality wine in a high class restaurant but seem thrilled to serve coffee that defies description)So enjoy your meal at Lime, but go our for a coffee
4
Last weekend had lunch buffet at Park Royal Hotel. Amazing range of food with friendly service crew -- Jun June, she is friendly and helpful. Next month will be there for another occassion!
4
Atmosphere was ideal for couples. We were pleasantly served by one of the service crew who attended to us promptly whenever needed, and was very courteous while doing so. Thank you for the pleasant experience!
4
Great place to have a good meal, the food mix is very good and love the lobster soup,
the place have a very good atmosphere and the staff are very attentive and provide very good service to us, will go for dinner again next year.
4
Had high tea at this place with a friend, very good ambiance & service
Value for money
Good food....
2
Not much food. Not worth the money. But salmon and oysters were really fresh. Would definitely choose other restaurants over this .
2
The restaurant is under staff and there are no supervisors around. No staff pay attention to diners and I have to go to the cashier myself for billing after waiting for half an hour where no sight of staff attend to you. The buffet food is also not fresh and are limited in choice. The saving grace was the seafood gumbo soup which unfortunately after they top up the pot, it had turned diluted and tasted bad. The staff have no care for customers where they do not wait on customers
5
We reserved a seat for a sunday lunch. It was a quiet day and not so many people which I really loved! The buffet lunch starts at 12:30pm and lasts up to 4:30pm. They have a wide range of selection to choose from. I particularly liked their fresh oysters! Fresh fruit juices, coffee and sodas are inclusive of the package. Dessert section is awesome! I liked their pudding! I topped it off with ice cream, caramel, chocolate and banana sauce! Haha! Staff are very attentive and friendly!
5
We were pleasantly surprised with the decor and the variety and quality of food. While the seafood selection is excellent, getting an instant stir fry made to your taste or slice of roast kicks it up a notch.The dessert selection was also fantastic.Highly recommended if you are not on a budget

I patronized this restaurant on 19 Feb to celebrate bday of my beloved. The restaurant is part of the hotel chain, serves the hotel guest as well as any visitors. I had a prior experience from a similar buffet outfit from another hotel under the same hotel chain and that visit was great, so I decided to try this one out.The ambiance was impressive, the restaurant is not bounded by physical wall and one can see the lime-colored sign from afar to know this is the place. It's a big premise, lots of seats to cater a large cohort but spacious. My beloved chose a comfy corner to dine: four distinct tables with sofa enough to seat 4 persons per table, and the staff was obliging to our request for one of the tables.It was dinner time when I visited, a number of cooked Asian cuisines is readily available for buffet spread, to name a few: cereal fried shrimp, mushroom cooked with vegetables, curry chicken and cooked egg-tofu. There is also other Asian variety such as Tuna, Salmon and Octopus sashimi, Chinese style roast chicken, roast duck and roast pork. For paying a premium price, I'd like to see more exquisite dishes like sea cucumber, fish maw soup and even lobster bisque.This restaurant is good for people with sweet tooth. There many sweet delicacies, such as green tea fondue fountain accompanied with marshmallows, great variety of ice creams with many sweet topping like chocolate chips to choose from, fruits like guava, honey dew, watermelon. There is also a dedicated showcase of cakes, not in slices but full cakes to delight cake lovers, but these cakes have to be paid for separately though they are located within the restaurant premise. But for buffet guests, there is a separate corner with bite-size cake-lets available for the sweet tooth. For beverages, I've seen hotel guests ordering Tiger beer. But was told that sweetened carbonated soft drinks and alcoholic drinks have to be separated paid for, like the exquisite cakes.The overall experience is ok, nice
4
pros : good location, central. parking is convenient (and complimentary) and near mrt as well. varied selection international fare - seafood, cooked dishes and local dishes. the dessert spread is a must - try the ice cream - they are the best. the oysters and sashimi were very fresh. service is attentive. ambience is pretty ok. the restaurant wasn't too crowded on a friday night. cons : the only thing i did not fancy was the fruits were not fresh (probably out too long) and did not look appealing at all. price-wise, it's on the high side, only one credit card offered 20% discount
5
Excellent a la carte and buffet spread. Menu and buffet (international and local) has been well designed - a rarity. Service is excellent and ambience perfect !
5
Went there with family. The staff were fantastic. Very friendly, keeps coming around to check if everything is ok.
4
We stayed at the hotel and tried both the morning buffet and the dinner buffet. A lot of different food with great taste. Highlights: you can order fresh juice, a lot of fresh fruit, mini chocolate donuts - sushi/sashimi, hummus and pita, beef stew and ALL the desserts :-DPs. The air conditioning is to the cool side
3
Went for a CNY buffet dinner on a Saturday night. Restaurant was about 60% occupied. The dessert spread was much better than the rest of the buffet. Some guests commented the sashimi were not as fresh and smelled. The local dishes were very disappointing, both in variety and quality. The prawn noodles were just lukewarm and Ngoh Hiang were cold, hard and tasteless. Overall I think it's way below expectations, considering it was highly rated 1-2years ago. I cannot help but feel the poor attendance on a Saturday night has something to do with the drop in food standard
4
There is a buffet but we went with the menu each time we went. Nice spice to some of the foods so if you don't want that make sure to ask. The wait staff was attentive. On the way out we went to the chocolate counter and took some truffles with us
5
I chose the al la carte menu and was very pleased with the choice offered. The food was excellent. Haven eaten in Michelin star and hat restaurants around the world, I would say that this meal was equal to the best I've had. Whoever the chef was on the night of 21 January deserves applause. The service was also excellent with attentive staff who were friendly and made it a very enjoyable night

My wife arranged to take me and friend to this restaurant for lunch on my birthday as I had admired the hotel from outside and my wife had been told the Resturaunt was good. Unfortunately the exterior of the hotel belied the poor service and distinctly average food. We ordered off the ala carte rather than the buffet as we wanted it to be a bit special. Two of us ordered Entree and three of us main course. We ordered a bottle of wine and awaited the food. To our surprise my wife's entree arrived together with all three main courses. We explained that we wanted the entree's first and that I was still waiting for mine. The waitress then explained that she had not taken the order for my entree and what did I want to do about it. With another waitress stood behind her with the main courses I felt like the problem was being shifted to me. I instructed that they should take the main courses back whilst my wife finished her entree and cancel my entree. My wife found the crab dish poor and not as described in the menu. When finished we were presented with our main courses of steak which I was not convinced had been re-cooked but we gave them the benefit of the doubt. The steaks were average quality and expensive for what they were. In fairness the waitress did apologize and offered us a free desert and coffee, neither of which we wanted. Interestingly we never saw a manager and no one but the waitress spoke to us about the situation. When the bill came the waitress took 20% off the bill but honestly I would have preferred to have paid full price and had a nice experience. In my view there is a management issue in the Resturaunt that needs to be addressed. We live in Singapore and dine out regularly but we will not be going back to the Limes!

It was a pleasant dinning experience at Lime reastaurant, ParkRoyal. Did not carry high expectations because I preferred the usual hotel restaurants in Marina Bay.Interesting mix of European, International and local Singaporean as well as Asian cuisine. Surprised to see Spanish Paella as part the buffet as it is not normally being prepared in hotel restaurants. It was mucho delicioso! Not as pricey as other hotel restaurants. Yet, food is as good. Generous choices of desserts after a satisfying buffet meal
2
Came for the high tea set on a weekday and service staff were not attentive or "nowhere-in-sight". The food served on the set were so-so only..... too many sweet desserts and only 1 savoury food to taste (the savoury food is only the assorted sandwiches, 8x half slices.....). What killed my experience was that the chefs were cooking in the open (probably it's their concept) but then the smell goes around the restaurant and in your hair, which is definitely not acceptable
5
Lime is located in the stunning Park Royal Hotel. The hotel's architecture/style is the very best/striking in Singapore. Lime is an open concept restaurant and its buffet lunch matches the very high standard set by the hotel's unique features.The menu is very diverse and each dish is prepared with style and expertise. Any discerning "foodie" will love the experience!
4
Buffet breakfast is passable but what makes it remarkable is the staff with cheery disposition and ready smiles. Nice mornings!
5
Lovely restaurant, excellent buffet spread, especially desserts! Service was impeccable, good quality good, food variety more than enough, coffee excellent
4
It was my birthday that day and the staff celebrated my birthday by giving me a red velvet cake with dark chocolates and food was good but not great
4
Came here on different ocassion, best is their sunday buffet or any other festive buffet. Always love the green tea chocolate fountain!
5
Food was good! Enjoyed the desserts, especially the white chocolate matcha fountain. Good spread of food from seafood to meats/pasta and even chinese food. Service was great as well and they also attended to my earlier queries promptly on email.
2
To expensive , not much variety of food, the steak is gummy, and the service crew is selective they only say good evening to those European look people, most specially the guy serving the sashimi,
4
Staff made my family feel welcome. Love the ambience & atmosphere, & the small surprise cake. Was a very sweet measure & we didn't expect it :)
5
I visited this place for Christmas Buffet Lunch. Please book a table in advance else you may land up in the kids chair beside the coffee bar. This place is located in Park Royal hotel. Since the Christmas lunch was a buffet; the variety, the taste , the attention to service was impeccable. Do give this try if you are in Singapore during Christmas
5
I booked this dinner way in advance because I had read many encouraging reviews. I must say, Lime did not disappoint! The food is delicious, and the variety made everyone in the family happy, regardless of their taste preferences.We had some stress because there was a drunk group being very loud and they ran out of Diet Coke. The managers apologized and for we could have left it at that and have left with a good feeling. However, they did amazing in customer service recovery by giving us a discount and complimentary sparkling wine! It was a fantastic service and atmosphere with the carolers, and we will certainly come back!
4
The Christmas ambience was awesome, with beautiful decors. The spread and quality of the food was also pretty good, much better than my visit 2 years ago, most probably due to the additions from the Christmas spread such as Wagyu Beef, Turkey, Duck Confit, as well as local Peranakan spread such as kueh pieti, bobo chacha, assorted kuehs, etc
4
The ambience was great but there's not such a wide variety compared to other hotel buffets. The king crab was often unavailable too.
4
The food is nice, the staff i super friendly everything is great but i find the price abit too expensive
5
Nice ambience with good quality food. Service crew was great, special thanks to Amy, Irene & Carol for taking good care of my family (and the toddler) during our meal. :)
4
Spacious, very good variety but lobster quite tough, very dim good for romance, best service. Very fresh oysters. Gives us compliment cake for belated birthday dinner :)
4
We had omelets that were cooked perfectly. The fresh breads and jams are delicious. Many fresh fruits to choose from. We had four different wonderful cheeses to select from. There's a whole lone of Asian noodles etc to select. There's more to choose from than you could ever eat. The chili sauce was delicious
2
Had a dinner buffet in a noisy (some birthday party) and dark ambience. The restaurant is so small and narrow. Although there is a variety of stations, food selection is very limited. Not enough for a buffet at this price.Seafood didn't taste fresh enough. Shashimi was OK but you need to ask the staff to cut. Dessert was very boring. Hongkong dim sum and roasted goose were quite nice. They also have durian pengat
4
Had a chance to try the high tea (3-6pm). The savory and sweet items were a good spread for the money paid ($38++ for 2 pax). WIde selection of coffee and TWG teas. Environment was well decorated and cosy. Excellent place to catch up with friends to chit chat
4
I am quite a big eater and Lime is definitely not a place for variety for a 4-5 star hotel restaurant. Beautiful place and ambience. Perfect for those first dates. 30 mins into the dinner and we got bored of the choices we have. So we slowly indulged in the better dishes (asian). There were quiet a number of good stuffs offered. BUTTTT, separate ala carte order. Asian food is their key. I believe. Pasta selection was very limited.
5
Great variety of food, and very tasty, nothing to extravagant but fun atmosphere with very lovely staff.One of the chefs to time out of his day to have about good half hour chat about food and his travels ( we are massive foodies) so it was nice to hear someone very passionate for his job. Even if I hadn't stayed at this hotel I would recommend eating here
4
the restaurant offer a wide array of foods from Japanese bento (with bento displayed for ideas) to the classic western breakfast. the seating is also spacious for the hurried diners or the more leisurely travellers can sit by the window and watch the traffic go by. the taste is standard, nothing stands out though
4
First class buffet with a wide selection including seafood. The dessert section is large and includes a chocolate fountain.
4
The waitresses and waiters were very prompted in their service. It was the Halloween theme when we visited and the ambience is good!
5
You can go whichever way in this place - I'm still checking out all the different food on each visit.
3
Functional. Efficient. Good breakfast fare. Not a 4 or 5 star ambience, more like 2 or 3. Buffet is good, although we ordered a la carte for dinner. Good price point.
5
We celebrated our mom's birthday at Lime. Buffet dinner spread is good; service is exceptional! Shoutout to service staff Ahmad who provided our mom with a shawl upon learning that she was feeling cold, and arranged for a birthday cake coupled with a sing-along by a few of the service staff. Ahmad also proactively informed us of complimentary parking with minimum spending of S$100. We will definitely be back!
4
Early morning flight so we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant -Lime.We decided not to go for the buffet - although it looked lovely (not sure about the green 'chocolate' fountain though)Four diners - two chose western dishes and two ate from the Asian / Singapore specialties. The Singapore Pop Tay as a shared starter was still huge, and the Green Thai Curry nad Butter Chicken with naan and rice were healthy portions too.Nice flavours and two of the group enjoyed desserts, complete with 24carat finish!Only slight annoyance was the fact that two nearby tables seemed to be treating the restaurant as an office - one man with his lap top, talking on mobile phone. Another couple appearing with their document folders and iPhones to discuss over their buffet.Sorry, a restaurant is for eating - want to work too? Eat in the lobby or suite or booth
3
Went to Lime Restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday last Sunday. There's this promotion going on where we get to dine for four hours. Pretty good a deal I would say as we can take our time to eat. The wait staff were excellent, very helpful and friendly. However, the food was not as fantastic as I thought. The seafood bar (which I was so looking forward to) was not as fresh as I expected. Might give it another try but not in the near future
5
Went to Lime on Oct 29 for Halloween buffet. Atmosphere was outstanding: most of the restaurant staff wore costumes and there was lots of Halloweem-themed decorations and food. Overall food quality was good. Extensive array of food from many different food cultures, including local food. Our favorite was the laksa with lobster; it was cooked before our eyes and tasted delicious! Staff were very friendly and very much got into the Halloween spirit.Overall, we had a very fun evening and can recommend Lime to anyone else in the mood for a unique Halloween experience
4
Conducive restaurant environment coupled with good food and attentive service makes for a a very happy and enjoyable dinning experience with colleagues and friends!Capturing the happy moments on photo can be challenging due to the tall huge glass panels which can result in over exposures from some angles
2
Just went to this restaurant and had a very disappointing meal started of with a sharing a entree of duck , dry and tasteless , then came the mains lobster and crab risotto .Lobster and crab so dry and tasteless and the risotto was a porridge consistency very over worked and tasteless , the other guest had pasta tortulini very disappointing again tasteless and dry. Went to pay the bill told the person our mains were disappointing and the response was a smile and I don't give a damn attitude just pay the bill. Our first dinner in Singapore was a huge waste of money what a bad choice when there are plenty of places to eat 
5
The food selection, dessert table, ambience is decently good. Staff are attentive and seen during the buffet lunch, being able to attend to our needs and requests. The high ceiling within the venue is very much appreciated.
4
Stayed at Parkroyal for 5 days and had dinner in Lime restaurant couple of times. The food was good especially the Singapore dishes we ordered like Laksa, Pork ribs soup and kway teow. Good ambience and service.
2
It's a celebration for my boyfriend, staff contacted me to let me know there will be a complimentary birthday cake yet it was not serve at all!
5
Had lunch meeting and was very pleased with the ambience of the restaurant. Requested for a quiet corner and was given a corner sofa seat. Staff was very friendly, all smiles and helpful. Would like to especially compliment Eeviee (not sure if that's how her name was spelled) as she was exceptionally attentive to us. Ordered ala carte. Plating of food was unique and portion was generous. Great job to all the staffs there and we definitely will be back to try the hi-tea/buffet
2
The food was distinctly poor. All the pork meats were too lean and dry. The filling for the kueh pie tee was also way too long and couldn't fit into the shells. rest of the food was bland and uninspiring. Bread and pita were also cold and hard. The only thing I can say that was good was the smoked snow fish and the green tea chocolate fondue. Service was very pleasant though. Had a really good waitress called Amy who was friendly and helpful. Overall, i would not go again.
3
LOBSTERFEST !!! Lobsters and that's what we came for. Very excited and hungry as we haven't had buffet in ages. Personally never a big fan for buffet but how can I ever say no to the big red king of seabed. Excitement soon change to disappointment for all. No doubt many ways and varieties of cooking lobsters but the meat was too tough. Highlighted to the manager on duty and boy, he was so kind enough to cook us fresh from the kitchen. We gave it another go but results equally disappointing . Concluded, Chef did great but quality of lobster was not. End up we start feasting the arrays of desserts . Overall, nice place great service but food wise , well we came for lobster so ya... :(
4
We opted for the Tiers of Joy high tea set for sgd 38 (before taxes). It came with pastries, macarons, quarter sandwiches and a plate of scones with free flow beverages. the scones were served bakingly hot with sides of clotted cream and jam. The cream was marvellous, and the jam was the perfect accompaniment to cut the dairy with its sweet tartiess.The sandwiches were, on the whole, nice, especially the delicious smoked salmon. However, we found the tuna ones to be overly salty. The pastries were really nice as well, and the macarons were sweet and gooey in the middle. Perfect! Do bring your sweet tooth as most of the food here are sweets.There was a nice selection of teas and coffee. We only tried the teas, and the ones we had were delicious, though you want to be careful ordering late refills as the brew might get old and a tad bitter (the free flow of tea and coffee ends at 6pm, we ordered our last around 5 plus).Overall, I'd give the place the following rating:Ambience: 10/10Food: 8/10, pastries and macarons are sweet, be forewarned!Service: 7/10, we had one very good server, Alice. The rest were all busy elsewhere with the buffet so everything was slow.Value for money: 8/10Overall: 8/1
4
Great breakfast with plenty of room so you don't feel like you are on top of each other - especially before you have had a coffee. Service is terrific. Never had better French Toast anywhere in the world. Great selection of all breakfast food to suit wherever you are from in the world
1
Went here with my boyfriend since we were staying in the park royal hoteland the restaurant looked generally nice. We ordered food and they brought starters n main meal at the same time. Starters were hot and so we said that while we r eating starters, the main courses will get cold and they seemed that its okay that way. Next i ordered simple chicken with fried rice. When i started eating in the fried rice were calamari and prawns. I hate sea food and was shocked. I asked the waiter if its written in the menu thinking how could i miss it. The waiter admitted that its not in menu, apparently the menu is new n they forgot to mention it!!!! I mean some people have allergy to sea food. It's unacceptable in such a restaurant in 5* hotel. Again nothing was done about this except sorry. Lastly the bill came and they charged this food which i didn't even eat, and extra glass of wine which we didnt order, then i got really upset and argued until they took the meal off the bill. Overall too many mistakes. Would not recommend to come here! I would expect desert for free or something to make up for these mistakes.
4
Good selection as always but some strange aspects. There is a selection of whole fruits and celery stalks at very edge of the buffet but there's no indication that these are for juicing and this is far from the salad and the dessert fruits. The peranakan selection is good but strangely located so that our is not properly integrated with the rest of the spread which is very unfortunate because it is very good. Some misses. The dimsum is actually very mediocre. Not worth the calories
4
Had our Company Dinner at Lime Restaurant last Friday. The atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome! The staff are friendly and helpful.
They have a wide variety of food to select from for their Friday Dinner Buffet.
Overall: it is good! Recommended!
5
Other than the wide selections of quality food from different kitchens the service of the restaurant is tiptop too. Great for those who have a huge appetite :)
3
gret value for the price paid, especially with crd discount. A mixture if local and international cusine to tickle your taste buds. Eg. laksa, kueh pieti, sushi, sashini, choice ribs, etc. There is also durain pengyet togather other deserts. Great place for an evening of talks with close friends while enjoying the food
4
We were there on a Sunday evening for the buffet. We had a 6:30pm reservation. It was rather quiet with few diners at that time. We feel that the restaurant caters to a mix of diners ranging from family to gathering of friends, romantic couples as well travellers on business. The modern decor and soft lighting give the restaurant an ambience that is associated with relaxation and makes it a nice place to unwind and forget about the fast pace of life outside. Besides the wide variety of food that we enjoyed, we also like the square spacious dining table that was reserved for us. The service staff are professional and attentive. The cost of the buffet is S$65++ per person. We think that it is worth it considering the relaxed ambiance and its positive effects we experienced there
1
By far, this would be one of the worst restaurants that we had visited. Inconsistent service level where some service staff were great and others mediocre. Food selection was pretty limited for both dinner and breakfast. The quality of the food was pretty average as well. Totally not worth spending the time and money at this place.
5
The LIME restaurant serves both a la-carte and buffet meals. I took advantage of the international buffet which has a huge variety of food on offer.There is a traditional western section with pasta and steak, an Indian section, seafood, salads, local Singaporean fare and a wide variety of desserts including a Green Tea chocolate fountain and various ice cream flavours.My favourite part was the selection of local food, such as the make-it-yourself fruit salad with spicy topping, Nyonya Kuih Pie Tee ("Top Hats") and the Bo Bo Cha Cha. I kept coming back for more!Solo diners can sit at counter seats to appear less 'alone'
3
Had a Sunday night reservations and the restaurant had a healthy amount of crowd and not too busy. Ambiance wise they've definitely have plus points with the modern design and table settings with sofa seats also made available. They also have sharing common tables in the middle.Food wise there were asian cuisine such as Dimsum (small variety), Roasted Meat (however all we got on our plate for us was meat with 80% bones on it, taste wise still good). Have Indian cuisine as well.The pumpkin soup was really good and no doubt the live station pasta was nice however lack of variety of pasta that day where we wanted linguine but they only serve penne. One more thing to add about the pasta is that they only have tomato base or aglio olio and no cream base which was pretty saddening for me.Limited variety of sashimi (salmon squid tuna only). With the price of $66++ per person i expected at least yellow tail or swordfish option to choose from.Fresh Oysters Clams & Mussel were available and very fresh at the same time they have fresh cold cuts available right next to it.Desserts with the famous Macha Fondue. It is definitely a fresh idea however I thought it was pretty overrated. However which, we give our experience a 7.5/10.UOB Card holders get discount as well! Carpark is really expensive there tho
5
Great buffet lunch though there isn't any oyster. Check out their credit card promotions eg: pay 3 get 1 free (Each pax is abt $42.30 after taxes). Normal price is $56.30 after taxes.It's an international buffet and there are LIVE stations for char kway tiao and pasta. You can also try your hands on pie-ti and rojak. The prawns and scallop are very fresh. There is a sashimi counter where you can place your order and they will carefully prepare your sashimi. Another good news for those with sweet tooth! The dessert spread is very extensive; there is a fondue fountain with wide spread of cakes and dessert cups. There are also handmade ice creams with flavors like black sesame, gulau melaca, lemon sorbet etc.

We weren't sure if we wanted to try out the Lobster buffet at Lime as we weren't sure what else there might be as my partner is not a huge seafood fan but thank god we decided to go for it. OMG is was fantastic, absolutely loved it. We didn't have a booking but the staff was fabulous, thought the night staff was very attentative, caring and fun to be around.The food... Absolutely wonderful, for me the absolute hit were the oysters, they were sooooooo good, the lobster risotto, the lobster laksa, the lobster Singapore chilli and the tuna and salmon sashimi.The cheese selection was not as extensive as other places but boy it was good. The dessert selection was wonderful too. We definitely will be heading back

Spent friday of last week at Lime for their high tea. I cannot fault this value for money high tea experience. Free flow tea and coffee. So many different tea to choose from, although not served in a pot u get a fresh cup whenever u want. Tea set was delicious and more towarda traditional. Samdwiches, delicious macaroons enspecially salted caramel and lemon, and not to mention the beautiful sweet treats. The set is more than enough for 2 ladies. And at $19++ it is an absolute must. Resrtuarant is beautifully modern and classy with good service. I will certainly go again!

Good buffet with lots of choices of many nationalities of food. Atmosphere pleasant although a little noisy for a business lunch. Would return on a social occasion.
5
The staff, specifically Jessie, was very courteous and attentive to our needs. Good food, big servings, and value for money considering it's a hotel restaurant.

We had the buffet at Lime Restaurant. Being a holiday it was around $65 per person. The variety was rather limited although the food was cooked decently enough.
4
We were lucky enough to drop a visit to the buffet dinner while they are having their Lobster special!Food selection was great and the Singapore Lobster Chilli with Mantou bread was out of this world, and not forgetting the Black Pepper Lobster too.A great range of Lobster variety, along with a good selection of cold dishes. We paid SGD99 per person, and was greeted with a welcome drink by the friendly staffs of LIME.Staffs were friendly and always punctually picking up your dirty plates / refilling your drinks. Dessert selection was great too - Ice Cream, Sorbets, Creme Brulee, Red Velvet Cake, Bread and Butter Pudding, Chocolate mousse just to name a few. Definitely a great place for a buffet and highly recommended

Dined here a couple of days ago with my wife after a quick read-up about good high-tea service in the city. Tried to reserve a table for us about an hour prior to our arrival but no one answered the phone. We walked-in and the waitress ushered us to a table and presented us the menu which had a wide-selection of tea and coffee to pair of with the three tier high-tea set, which serves two. The three tier set consisted of five types of small sandwiches, five types of desserts and four types of macaroons. They also served a generous serving of raisin scones with clotted cream and strawberry preserves. The sandwiches were fresh, the dessert selection was delicious and the macaroons were refreshing. The scones were served lukewarm though. The drinks menu was the highlight of the set. There was a wide variety of tea selections which included caffeine free choices as well. They also served hot chocolates, cappuccinos and lattes. The drinks were free-flow. Overall, the food was tasty, the ambience was great and the service was attentive.

I was there on Saturday - to celebrate both my wife's birthday and also Mother's day, together with my family, parents and sisters. We called in ahead of time to book for a buffet lunch and mentioned that we will be bringing a baby along and would require a baby chair. To our surprise, they not only brought out the baby chair, but also provided my child with baby friendly crockery and utensils! +1 for effort and thought put into the preparation. In addition, they also gave us a semi-exclusive dining area, which was spacious and allowed for us to place our bags at the end of the room. This was probably designed to be a private dining area which was opened for guests at the buffet. Parents with children would know the amount of bags and peripherals you would have to bring along when you bring your kid along. +1 for dining space allocation. Food was the usual fare; international cuisine and the usual. What struck me was the delectable Matcha chocolate fondue fountain. Yes! Matcha chocolate fondue fountain. Paired this with the ice cream and it was sensational! +1 for a unique dessert offering (something which I have not seen before).The ambiance was great and service was excellent as well. Special mention to the wait staff that went back to double check with her manager on the promotions that were available even when we had handed her the credit card to process the payment. I would definitely revisit the restaurant

We tried the buffet one day when staying at the Park Royal (on Pickering.) The selection was good. North American and Asian cuisines are both available.Since then I have noticed that I could have used my HSBC credit card to get a 1 for 1 deal with their 'Entertainer' app. This deal doesn't seem to be available at the moment, but possibly it will return

Last weekend, my family celebrated my birthday over the buffet lunch@ Lime. It was my first visit there and I was pretty impressed with the ambience, food and professionalism of the service staff.The environment is comfortable and even though it was lunch peak hour, the restaurant was not noisy at all. The restaurant's layout is well furnished and passage way is spacious that we do not find it over-crowding at the food stalls areas.Overall, we were awed by the wide array of food available. However for a selection of few, we thought that the selection can be better (example-seafood). Well my favourites are the peranakan-style desserts, lobster egg benedict, roast meat, fruit juice and truffle sauce pasta.Last but not least, not forgetting to give credit to the service crew on their positive attitude to serve with a genuine smile.One suggestion- perhaps it is good to serve all birthday celebrants with a glass of champagne

We were lucky enough to stay in the Park Royal on Pickering where Limes Restaurant is. Every morning the day had an excellent start with the Buffet Breakfast in Limes. The range of food available is mind boggling and in my case the Asian foods available were more than satisfying. The service is excellent and in particular a lovely Indonesian woman called Vita looked after us as if though we were royalty. Within one day of being there she would greet me by name every morning.Treat yourself to one of the best meals you will find in Singapore and eat at Limes
5
A massive Thank You to Kangxin, Ronath. Peter, Eve & team at Park Royal on Pickering, Lime restaurant. They even took a photo of me to inform their staff of my special needs (Gluten Free & no MSG). They went way beyond my expectations & provided for me as I was unable to eat each evening due to work commitments until 22.35. I can't thank them enough. Food was fantastic & loved going there as they made me feel so welcome, even though it was close to their home time. Well done team I will be back on my next trip
4
Lots of different things to choose from for all meals. Including Western and Eastern food. We were very pleased with the meals we had there during our stay.
4
The restaurant has a great breakfast and lunch buffet. Very good options and tasty food. Service is a bit slow and confused as many of the waiters and waitresses don't speak English and don't understand what is being said - could use improvement.
5
The Lime Restaurant at Pickering is one of the finest restaurants I have been to in Singapore. The setting is quite classy and modern and there is a great variety of excellent food. I myself have been there several times after being introduced to the place by Entertainer Singapore (app). It is a great place to take family and friends and I would highly reccomend it
3
As with the rest of the hotel this restaurant is just off the mark. Service was confusing and all over the place… no consistency. Very expensive drinks even for Singapore and don't order anything that may be spicy as the food is hot hot hot and no advice is given nor are you asked if you have a preferred level of heat. The prawns ( jumbo crispy) are the star dish

Celebrated my sister's birthday at Lime in January. Enjoyed the great Great variety of food, especially the cakes and desserts. There was a Pasta station that allowed us to select different type of pastas, according to our preference. Must try dishes: durian with gula melaka, char siew roast pork, beef rendang. I am a fan for sweet stuff. My favourite desserts were the salted caramel tarts and the red velvet cakes.We were allocated à private room for our family of 12. The ambience was great, with unique, traditional pieces of furniture decorating the room.We ended our dinner with a sweet gesture from the restaurant, a delicious birthday cake for my sister.Would definitely recommend the buffet for its variety of food and desserts! If you have a sweet tooth, Lime serves a greater variety than Cafe mosaic at Carlton Hotel or Marriott cafe.Will return soon

My husband and I thought this would be a great restaurant to try for dinner. Pros: The building and the restaurant are gorgeous. The staff was acceptable. Cons: The food is beyond terrible. It's extremely expensive...and no one old us the price until we received the check ($158 for two and no alcohol!). The selection is poor and spread out in an absurd way. The food is cheap. Don't expect to be wowed or impressed by anything. We were hoping to at least finish strong, but the ice cream was soup by the time you made it back to your seat and the bread pudding was so dried out. Do yourself a favor by passing this place up for dinner and heading over to the Rise Restaurant at Marina Bay Sands!!! Now that's an impressive and delicious buffet! Lime was a ginormous date night let down. We should have taken the hint when we realized the place was nearly empty...
2
Decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant this morning because it was convenient. However, appears that bucking the trend and going al la carte rather than buffet upset the whole apple cart. From miscommunication (Coke instead of coffee), to missing items of the order and no napkins. I am sure this experience is not typical but certainly it was well below my expectations. The breakfast itself was OK but a mixture of too salt and sweet.
2
My parents and I was there for my birthday celebration but I am very disappointed with the food quality provided. Both the Roasted Lamb and Beef is cold and hard. the fish curry was cold and the fried kway tiao was not up to standard. Only the love the dessert Spread that was good. Service was good too.Well I wont be going back there for the buffet anymore
4
Somewhere between Average and Very Good for me. The atmosphere is of course great in this unique hotel. The buffet dinner is average: dry food, limited selection. The a la carte option is better. The Nasi Goreng excellent. The wine list is ok and the cocktails are lovely. Service is terrific and there is wifi and a very relaxed mood to the place

Firstly we stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and was very happy in general with our stay including the club benefits but our meal at Lime for New Years Day was the low ! I had booked on line some months before and requested a window seat . When I arrived was going to be seated in the middle but pointed out that I had put in a request and provided all my details some time ago so was seated at the window. The restaurant was far from full even by the end of the meal so I found this poor form. The staff were pleasant but service for drinks was slow. As Australians it is almost sacrilegious to be served hot corona beer but my husband did ! And then I was served a cocktail that did not have a straw and was luke warm. The food was mediocre ! Much of the hot food was cold - fried fish and calamari ! Sauces where not placed close to complimenting food. There were prawns on offer but hard to enjoy as no water bowls to clean fingers or no bowl offered to put scraps on as one was peeling them. As my more substantial meal I chose to have noddles made freshly honestly they were sticky and bland. I could not finish them .... I had better and hotter noddles on my flight with Singapore Airlines now that is saying something . My husband had Western food that was nothing special. Meat tough and not inspiring at all . There was an enormous array of sweets . I did not have sweets but my husband enjoyed a few different selections. Probably the most disappointed thing for me was that the table across from me chose selections from the regular menu ! I had no idea that I could do that and would have preferred to do this than have a smorgasbord but I was almost finished the poor food selections on offer when I realised this was an option. It was also not cheap but would be reasonable if the food was of a higher standard and the drinks cold. The setting was very beautiful with stunning christmas decorations. Sadly was a memorable night for disappointing reasons !

good service and food!! will definitely return for the dinner!! love the selection of desserts and the cold seafood section!
4
Dined here for breakfast when staying here overnight and can recommend. Good variety. Great set up for business travelers looking for a good breakfast in a rush.

Wide selection of food. Seafood and sashimi was very fresh
Live stations were superb
Staff was friendly and attentive
Value for money

Probably one of the most affordable hi tea buffet in Singapore. Good selection of sweet delicacies. $38++ for 2pax or 1 set which is good enough for 2.Free flow of coffee & tea.We took tea & there is a good range to choose from. I found the finger sandwiches abit dry. The scones were warm enough so it was a gd treat to eat. They offer takeaways on the unfinished portions which is a great thing because they'll be no food wastage ! The service was good.The only downside to our trip was that we had to pay $10 parking for less than 2hrs! Wonder why we were not offered complimentary parking..
2
I celebrated my birthday at the Lime restaurant. We thought the Christmas Buffet would be a good treat but was sorely disappointed. The selection was not special, it was the usual oysters, salmon for the cold section and the Ham, Turkey, Roast Beef and some asian choices of chai kway teow and hor fun. Of all, I only like the creamy salmon and my partner liked the oysters. Dessert was not impressive either and only the crepes station was interesting. Although the taste of the food can be subjective, the selection, quality and service was clearly not up to the hotel standard and not worth the price. The buffet included free flow of juices and coffee and tea but we had to ask and check. Won't be back. There are many other buffets in town.
5
First I've got to say, the ambiance of the restaurant is really relaxing because it's spacious and there's lots of greenery! Also the wait staff really polite and attentive!! Alright, now, on to the review! For a person with a really sweet tooth, I was delighted with the countless assortment in the dessert section!! I ate as much dessert as I did mains!! Walking in, I was already sold!! With a good mix of Asian and western foods you'll be stuffed by the end of 2hours without really burning a hole in your pocket! I've to say, the price point; very competitive! Oh, and if you're driving, remember to ask for complimentary parking once you've hit the minimum spending. Which is either S$100 or S$150 i didn't hear the waitress properly only because I was stuffed by then! "Food coma"
5
I have heard good review of the dinner buffet but price was a deterrence. Went to try the afternoon tea instead. We were served tiered sandwiches, macorons, scones and some tarts. They are all of good quality. Love it that good coffee and tea are unlimited. Location is central just next to Hong Lim park, decor in the restaurant is simple yet comfortable
1
Although this restaurant is located at the five star Parkroyal on Pickering it provided a very poor dining experience. You would think that at S$68+tax+10% service charge you would be presented with a 5 star buffet. Far from it from our experience. We tried as much variety as we could but were disappointed with all our choices. We left most of the food on the plate. Some of the foods we tried that should have been hot were barely warm, some of the cold foods were not very cold. Staff at front entry were ok but the only two wait staff we saw were having a disagreement over something. Maybe they had tried the food! It was ages before anyone came to our table to take a drink order but by then it was too late. We left
2
Having heard wonderful reviews about the restaurant and its Christmas buffet, I decided to try it and it was highly disappointing. The worst was the dessert section where the desserts were either lacking in flavour or the balance in flavours. Thinking that nothing could go wrong with the salad section, the Thai mango salad tasted so not like one and was again bland. The Asian selection was not too bad but really the chefs cooking on demand need to be more skilled in preventing the food getting burnt and adding more flavours into the food.Service was methodological, but lacking in warmth. Definitely not worth the $78++ per person. Note that this price excludes 10% service charge and 7% GST

Had the Lobsterfest Buffet. A good variety of all-you-can-eat lobsters, quality food and free flow drinks which made every cent worth it. Efficient service and I was satisfied from the moment staff opened my taxi door to welcome me in even though I was just a regular guest. Good food and good ambience even though the heavenly creme brulee ran out too soon. No need to worry about not having enough lobsters though, they get refilled so quickly
5
Very nice ambience. The food is decent and the there is a wide variety of selection. Worth to try if you have yet to do so using the entertainer app.
5
Very elegant, but not stuffy hotel restaurant serving every kind of food imaginable! The presentation is creative and very attractive. Asian and western food - delicious.
3
The place looks amazing and fancy. And thats about it. The food served for breakfast is supposedly international, yet you find Asian cuisine is the majority served. So you will be left with soul-less croissant, eggs and fresh fruits. They also serve cornflakes for kids.
5
Just been there with my family to check out their Christmas theme buffet and we were not disappointed. From food to decor, the restuarant made great efforts to bring out the Christmas theme.Seafood was succulent and not to forget the turkey, ham and lamb leg!There was even a lollies section at the dessert counter for the kids! The freshly made crepe with your choice filling was delightful.Ice cream came in four flavours and with more than ten types of toppings to choose from, I was really spoilt for choice.This buffet is a little pricey than non festive season but the spread and variety of food justifies the price charged.Service was brisk, we had our plates cleared and water refilled promptly. The staff also took the initiatuve to asked if we wanted tea or coffee. We enjoy ourselves so much that we will be back again
3
Been waiting a while to try out this new(ish) restaurant at the (newish) Parkroyal on PIckering. That opportunity came when a visiting friend decided to stay at the hotel. The friend sat down, complaining about the terrible service at the hotel itself. So it was an auspicious start to the meal. We exacerbated the situation by deciding to go a la carte, rather than do the usual hotel buffet lunch. It took forever to get even the diet coke my friend ordered as his beverage. For the food, we had to send several reminders. All in all, the food itself wasn't bad - but the hotel and the restaurant need to really train up their staff
5
This restaurant offers fantastic breakfasts with all sorts of juices, different breads, salmon, cheese and going through Asian specialties like noodles and steamed food, bacon, beans, any omelet you want, etc. The decoration of the place is really nice and inviting to stay, and the staff very polite. Fully recommended
4
This place was listed as one of THE place to go for high tea. Came here for high tea for 2. Large dining area and wasn't too crowded, noisy or busy. Ambience is great for a lazy sunday. Very happy with the friendly and warm staffs. The lady who served us was very friendly and helpful. Always very alert and quick to assist. The tea set was a good mix. Scones was buttery and of the right texture. Not too hqrd or biscuit like. Served with strawberry jam & cream. The petit cakes n tarts was tasty and perfect to the bite. There's also other cakes n bakes you can order separately at reasonable prices. You can choose various types of tea OR coffee to go along with your set. Im very happy with my visit. Shall be back

My first time dining for dinner with my spouse and 2 siblings. The restaurant is really clean and high class. Buffet spread is really awesome but I am sure they can taste better than the current standards, as compared to other buffets we had at other hotel restaurants. Typical local Asian, Western and Mediterranean food can be all found here. The prawns were not fresh, both my siblings and spouse said the same thing because the shells sticked onto the meat, this meant the seafood is not very fresh. Hope they can work on this issue. Typical pastries were available too. I like their cold cut hams and roasted beef, overall the food tasted ok only. Price is quite expensive, around $85 per pax. Service staffs were normal, can work more on their smiles and speed of service but the cashiers (Korean crews) were professional and courteous. Will come back only when i am being treated by someone (for free). Not really recommended for their food, unless you like to try but service staffs are totally ok. Trust me you can find VERY authentic local Singaporean food just behind this hotel. The hawker centre is called Hong Lim Food Centre, which offers local & good food at relatively affordable price only. This is my 2 cents worth of experience
4
Wide spread of food (eastern & western) and great ambience! Very good service provided. Food was replenished quite quickly and the service staff and chefs were always ready to help! Empty plates were cleared as soon as you left the table to grab more food. We celebrated a birthday there and was treated with a slice of red velvet. So so so yummy ! Wish we knew that a complimentary parking coupon (4hours) was provided with every $100 spent
5
I never ate so much crab claws at one go. This lobster promotion until year end is great. Great ambience and food is replenished timely. And when they do, they disappear again just as fast. So you need to be on stand by to grab them fresh out of the oven or wok. And I do love them freshly cooked and hot. Pace yourself out.
4
Restaurant was part of our hotel (Parkroyal on Pickering). Had a very nice dinner. We ordered "a la carte" instead of using the buffet. Be in time, service closed at 11 PM.
5
This is a nice environment with all the friendly staff. Expecially with a staff name : (Jasmine). She is very friendly and hard working. Having a lunch buffet here make us feel comfortable. Thanks
5
The concept is buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner. It's very high quality with lots of choice and the seafood being a highlight. They also have roast meat and a good selection of desserts.
4
We had the breakfast buffet and whilst it was extremely busy the choice was very good. Service excellent and the only thing that could have been better was that the food could have been a bit hotter.
4
Enjoyed the experience ver much. The food was great as you woud expect from a top reseraunt as this is.
4
good atmosphere with a wide range of breakfast / lunch opportunities matching every need.
the quality of food and specialities was great.
service fine with a good sense of humor.
3
Breakfast here as its in Parkroyal on Pickering where I was staying. Wasn't really impressed with breakfast so didn't bother with dinner buffet. It looked hohum.
1
Don't bother the service was poor and the food cold expensive and over rated worst meal at a Park Royal we have had it was really disappointing
4
Took a client for lunch to the Lime restaurant yesterday. Buffet for 2 after a 15% discount (if you pay by MasterCard) cost 96 SGD in total which I thought was pretty reasonable for Singapore.Food spread - they have a live sashimi counter which has 2 options of tuna and salmon. Soft, fresh and good. There are also a whole bunch of sushi rolls which were okay. Next to it was a shellfish counter which looked good - did not want to try with a client opposite me.Cheese spread is limited to 2 options, bread range again okay - nothing off he chart. They also have a continental, Indian and local food section which were all okay.Desserts section is very elaborate - do try the chocolate crunchy cake and the local sweets. Creme brûlée is okay -Would be better if served warm/freshly burnt.Overall worth it - should try, and good value for money
4
Was excited to check out the Lobsterfest that is available on every Wed. My friend and I tucked into mouthwatering Maine Lobsters in various styles ranging from lobster gratin to Peranakan Nyonya LOBSTER laksa. As we were hankering for the natural sweetness of this delicacy, we had second servings of the fresh lobster on ice. In fact, this is my favourite way of enjoying lobster, with just a bit of horseradish and red wine sauce. If Lady Luck is with you, you might even pick one with a bonus lobster roe! Moving on to the hot food section, the unanimous crowd favourite was the Singapore Chilli Crab Maine Lobster, judging at how frequent the giant serving wok was emptied every time a new batch is furiously cooked and served. The sauce is luxuriously rich and not too sweet. But something more outstanding was the Wok-fried Black Pepper Maine Lobster that boasted good wok-hei and excellent aroma imparted by the use of curry leaves.

Lime restaurant has the best buffet you simply MUST go there for breakfast. The pancakes are fluffy and delicious their warm drinks are divine. The staff are very friendly but you must be very specific with you're order.
5
Just a pleasure to have Breakfast here each day. From the fantastic waiting staff to the cooks and the personal service. The food choice and variety is great.
4
Fresh selection of seafood such as oysters, mussels, clams and tiger prawns, usual sashimi station. A great variety of food spread in the buffet line, there is black pepper crayfish and recommend to make your own kueh pai tee! Desserts come with Nonya kueys, bobo cha cha and a Green tea chocolate fountain where you can dig your fruits and marshmallow
4
The sashimi, oysters and cold shrimps were so fresh and sweet! However, the dessert table was kind of disappointing with nothing unique. Would definitely go back for the seafood though!Using the Entertainer app was a bonus because we got a 1 for 1 which was fantastic value
2
This is the huge and good looking coffee shop in the Park Royal Hotel on Upper Pickering.The food was terrible. We had salads which were minuscule and contained very few greens. I'm sorry, but 3 Arugula leaves don't qualify as a salad especially at lime's prices.The menu offers very few choices and is misleading as above.Service was slipshod but that may have been because we were seated with a rather large pilar between our table and the inattentive view of waiting staff.i would have preferred the old standby Salad Nicose at the Mandarin Oriental's Captain's lounge and next time will as usual seek cool sanctuary in that dependable spot
4
The breakfast buffet is exceptional, great range, quality foods, excellent presentation. Well worth a visit for a good breakfast or if you stay in the hotel to dine there. Service could hitch up its socks a bit but overall a good place to get a good meal
5
Because Lime restaurant is located in one of the nicest hotels in Singapore, I think diners are on the right to expect much from this restaurant. Thankfully, Lime does buffet so well you would definitely want to make another trip soon. We came here last Saturday for dinner, just before catching a musical show at MBS. Buffet starts at 6:30pm and though we got there a bit early, there was no time for us to get bored because they have very comfortable chairs to plop on at the reception area while waiting - preferably with a glass of wine or cocktail in hand. I love their buffet selection! For their oysters and sashimi section alone, I daresay it would've already been worth the price. But of course, that's not all that you can have. When we were there, they had a scrumptious array of mains including duck confit (not a bit fan of their version of this dish though), pork belly with creamy mushroom sauce, some beef dish, grilled vegetables, grilled cheesy cauliflower, and many more. I was a bit disappointed with their cheese selection (they only had two types of cheese, a pity!) and the duck confit, as I have mentioned, wasn't at all like the way duck confits are made in Bordeaux. But apart from that, everything was superb, including dessert. My favourite was the creme brulÃ©e and the decadent chocolate fudge cake. Definitely coming back again, only this time, it'll be for lunch. The staff were all very nice and attentive as well. Highly recommended
4
Located near Chinatown this is a very nice restaurant. We came here for a team meal and there were about 14 people at our table. Even though it was my third buffet of the day it was still a great evening meal. A huge selection of food available (see photos) and all of excellent quality. Seafood was featured and was good. Also the first time I was served warm water rather than chilled - apparently quite common in Asian countries in the afternoon and evening.Recommended
2
I wasen`t satisfied at all with the buffet quality. All the meats offered where badly overcooked and therefore tough. Exept for the duck and orange dish which was just fine. Service wasn`t good as well. No beverage menu has been offered - I was just served with iced water..??!! Overall for over 70 SGD I was expecting better food quality and service. I had much better buffet dinners before. Will definitely not return
4
I don't tend to got to buffet restaurants but as I was staying at the hotel (Park Royal on Pickering) this is the hotel restaurant. I had dinner here one evening, its a little on the pricey side (but only the same as other hotel restaurant prices in Singapore) and I had the prime steak with potatoes and vegetables. The steak was cooked perfectly and all in all the dinner was very good. I had breakfast here for 2 days and that was also impressive. The staff are very attentive and very welcoming (they make both the restaurant and the hotel worth a visit!). The breakfast has everything to offer that you could want and its all cooked fresh and served hot.A good reliable restaurant, with good 'speciality' cocktails and great staff!
5
Lots of choices. Asian, Western whatever you want. Large choice of cereals, bakery items, fresh fruit or tinned, yoghurts, waffles etc etc. Omelettes, eggs freshly cooked to order.
5
A good spread of food, from oysters to kuehs to desserts. A nice birthday cake for my MIL from the restaurant. Excellent service from the staff. Place is not too noisy and nice for gatherings.
4
Email response was fast and helpful service staff at the restaurant which allowed my dad's 60th birthday to be celebrated smoothly and fulfillingly. Great job especially to Mr. Erol which left a great strong impression on my family and of the restaurant!
3
There was definitely plenty of different foods to chose from, I found everything was cold though which was very disappointing. It is also very noisy so if you are after something intimate I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Staff were very good though.
1
The place looks fancy and there are variety of food but it is lower than average.. We are staying at parkroyal hotel i thought it would be much better
3
While the food was good, the restaurant was very noisy and the air-conditioning kept too low. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible
4
Anyway, the previous two times, I was here for chilling out and brunch, therefore I was thrilled that I was coming back for dinner this time round. Their weekday evening dinner buffet costs around SGD$45.00 per pax, International cuisine, and this time round it seems there are more variety.From the Peranakan counter to the fruit + dessert stations; from salad to bread and pasta, marinated meats, seafood and Japanese counters etc, we were all spoilt for choice. Service was very hospitable as per last visits, and the setting was very comfortable.After the standard seafood, I enjoyed some Seafood Pie Tees that were utterly crispy on the exterior and generously filled with shrimps (and scallops?) within.The friendly chef came over with a famous Kuala Lumpur dish aka the specials of the day - Kam Heong Crabs (translates literally from Cantonese to mean "golden fragrance"). It was special because it was prepared with chilli and dried shrimps, and garnished with fresh curry leaves plucked from the rooftop garden of the hotel itself. Hence, the usual sweetness of the crab meat was now donned with the delicious spiciness of curry flavor.Then I moved on to some fresh greens, chicken cooked in gravy as well as Smoked Duck Breast. The latter was incredibly tasty, with a chewy, bouncy texture that gave way to tenderness once safely in the mouth.Finally, time for some desserts. The Creme Brulee was quite all right - crisp sugared top with golden-custard underneath. The mini Chocolate Tart was rich in flavor and ganache but my favorite was the Passion Fruit Chocolate Tart, for obvious reasons (simply they were delicious).For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/03/media-invite-dinner-at-lime-restaurant.htm

Our first breakfast was at 10am as we were late getting up after our late flight. It was extremely busy. We were shown to our seats and my husband went to get us juice. He was gone over 10 minutes and came back with 2 empty glasses!! He had to wait for the glasses by which time the juice had run out. We were shocked that it hadn't been refilled during our 45 minute breakfast!! There didn't seem to be anywhere near enough staff to cope with the volume of guests. There were queues for the egg station and the buffets. The food was ok though with a good variety of British, American and Asian choices. The egg station was eggcellent with choices of fried, poached, boiled to order or scrambled from the buffet. On our second day we went for breakfast just after 8am. This was such a better experience. Plenty of juice, quieter queues and so much better all round. As previous reviewers have advised, avoid breakfast after 10am!

Oh the variety! Do I have sushi? Do I have lamb cutlets? Do I try the local dishes? Cheese? Or.. Do I forsake all that for the green tea white chocolate fountain first!!? My partner and I chose the lunch because we could photograph all the food options with a lot more light so I can show my masterchef-loving mum later! Big fan of the Peking duck salad.. Actually all the salads but that one I went back for seconds and thirds for

This restaurant is set within the rather funky Park Royal Hotel building. This structure devours resources to appear environmentally sustainable with gardens hanging at high levels, though this style is more correctly a temple to the glorification of consumption. This restaurant is an ideal location to play The Capitalist's Buffet Game. The aim is to consume more value of raw materials than the buffet costs. This game has been won only by an elite group of financial services "fat cats". To succeed here at the Lime Restaurant, I would recommend the seemingly unlimited quantities of very fresh sashimi and sushi, as well as the smoked salmon. There are quite a few dishes which only offer moderate value, and these should be sidelined.The excellent selection of desserts is ideally suited to those who value consumption over personal health

We had the buffet - And don't let the usual image of a buffet discourage you - every thing on the buffet was simply finger-licking good. They had the variety - dim sum, Singaporean fares, sushi, filet mignion, and some awesome desserts.

Lime is a large comfortable hotel restaurant. The food is quite good but the service is a little sleepy. It has the feel of a disinterested hotel restaurant.

Heard few good reviews of the restaurant from friends and went there, with high expectations, for lunch (called brunch by the hotel) on New Year's day. Not quite satisfied. "Free flow of juices and soft drinks" was mentioned on the hotel website, as part of the buffet, but our requests for fruit juices were accepted with reluctance and there was never "free flow" , even though our glasses were empty. Few of the specialties mentioned in the website such as "Cod fish" were missing. When requested for it, came a terse reply that it was replaced by some other dish. My daughter was asking for a slice of pizza and when requested for it, came a "snap" reply that it will be served on the table. A cold slice of pizza landed on our table when we almost were having the dessert. The spread, in spite of the disappointments mentioned above, was appealing. For the amount paid, $108++ per head, it was not a "will come-back" experience

My wife and I spent our xmas lunch at Lime and were really impressed. The staff on email were great, initially they did not have space but they put us on the waiting list and found room for us later. They were always prompt in their responses.Aesa who greeted us on our arrival, immediately recognised who we were (knew our first names) which is very impressive. She came and checked up on us several times and even sent us photos of the day that night, superb customer service.The food had a good variety with xmas ham and turkey, other roasts, loads of seafood etc. The quality was quite mixed, prawns were fresh and great, as was the sashimi and smoked salmon, the fois gras and beef was superb and the xmas desserts of pudding and stollen fantastic. The roast prime rib and lamb were so rare they were inedible. Lobster average. Duck too tough. But considering the price we enjoyed it and I would rather the inconsistency with some things being great and some poor than just overall average.Carols were performed, a santa came around, photos were taken, name plates on the desk and xmas bags on the table. They were happy for us to stay on and relax after the buffet finishing time.The restaurant was light with nice decor and never felt too busy as many buffets do.Overall a great xmas day, thanks Aesa and crew

We had the Nonya set as this style of food had been recommended given it's local origins. Very interesting, but I would warn you about the shot glass dessert which has durian fruit - not a nice taste that stays with you, though it is very popular with Asians.A good experience which I would recommend overall.Service was good, though a little quick - more time between courses would have been appreciated.I also had my most expensive Guinness ever in the bar pre-dinner, at £11.00, so be warned

Lime is located within Park Royal on Pickering – a relatively new hotel that has a rather cool “hotel-in-a-garden” design. The restaurant itself has quite a stylish and contemporary interior décor, which creates a pleasant dining atmosphere. Price-wise, I personally felt that the S$62++ per adult for Saturday dinner was quite worth it even if their food choices weren’t that varied.Lime serves international cuisine, so you often have buffet staples like Japanese, Chinese, as well as Western etc. I would recommend that you go for the dishes with a more creative spin, rather than sticking to the buffet staples. For example, their Japanese section was quite dismal sad-to-say, but the sashimi choices were limited to salmon and tuna only, and their sushi lacked that stickiness, so they fell apart when I tried picking them up. The Chinese dishes weren’t that spectacular too; the Mongolian Pork Ribs were quite chewy that I gave up trying. Some of their desserts didn’t fare too well either. Their cheesecakes crumbled on touch, which probably meant they were too dry. Lime offers lots of different kinds of pies too, so if you’re not really a pie-person, you might find their dessert options alienating.That’s not to say that Lime is not all bad of course! I really enjoyed their creative, and more exotic dishes! With so many buffet choices available nowadays, you tend to see a pattern of staples repeated in restaurants across the board, so much so that when you encounter the usuals like seafood or Japanese, you can’t really help but start comparing which is fresher, which has more variety etc. So what I really like about Lime is that their chefs bother to go the extra mile, whether it is to come up with exciting dishes or put a creative spin on existing ones. The Peking duck salad is a good example of East-meets-West, taking what is normally offered in a Chinese fine dining setting and tossing it with veggies to create a mouth-watering salad. The meat was bite-sized and tender, and the sourness was just right, making it a light and fitting appetiser to start your meal. My other favourite was the tagliatelle aglio olio with anchovies from the pasta station, which turned out to be quite fragrant and flavourful despite my initial misgivings. Their crayfish laksa won my family’s praise as well. Desserts-wise, the really interesting ones would be the green tea white chocolate fountain, which offered a reprieve to those bored of the usual milk chocolate ones. The dessert that won me over would be the soursop and aloe vera soup, something unique to Lime. The soursop was light yet refreshing, making it a great dessert option if you’re feeling stuffed to the brim. I dined at Lime in January, but the fact that I can actually these dishes so well is quite telling of how spectacular Lime’s special creations were!Service-wise, the restaurant staff were generally quite efficient, albeit robotic, which was a sharp contrast to the friendly and speedy reply I received when I made reservations via email. Kudos to Ms Gizelle Dizon-Ng for that =) Reservations had to be done via email since the telephone number provided from the website went to the hotel instead, and they were completely clueless about any of Lime’s dining promotions

Our family just had lunch buffet today at Lime Restaurant today. I quite like the selection of food from sushi, seafood, meats, peranakan cuisine and desert. Lunch buffet was surprisingly full house on Thursday but the service crew left me with a good impression. They always look out to clear away the plates and filled the glasses with water which was fantastic. Send my regards to one of your service crew, Mr Erol with his warm hospitality and entertain the guests with his humour

A large group of us decided to meet up at the Park Royal on Pickering for a Saturday brunch. We had a mixed group from USA, Korea, Philippines, France and locals and the buffet supplied a delicious variety that satisfied everyone's palate. The food was fantastic. A couple highlights: - Fresh shucked oysters! These ones were brought in from Canada and they rotate where they source to keep a supply coming from cold (safe) waters. The chef is behind the counter shucking them in front of you so you know they're fresh. He's got a great attitude even if you keep coming back for more. That's impressive if you've ever tried shucking your own :)- The carving station! Heaps of meat roasted to perfection, sliced just for you. Save room to try the rest- Durian, the king of fruits! Ok, so I'm mixed blood so maybe it's in my heritage to like it. It's not for everyone but if you've never given it a shot you need to try it. In the dessert section they've got very fresh durian in tiny cups. I've had a lot of durian and they picked some quality ones.Service there was great. There was always someone close to clear plates as they were finished and I never once had to ask for a refill before one was brought (free-flow drinks). A shout out to some of the staff that made it such a good experience, thanks Aru, Aesa, Cathrine, Erol and Junjun! We'll be back soon :

We had a business seminar at this hotel recently. The service rendered was impeccable especially by Aru Vengedasamy - Lime Manager and the chef - Thinagaran. Aru ensured that my dietary restriction was met and catered to it on the spot. The chef - Thinagaran whipped me a seafood pescatore which was delectable. Both of them are value-added to the hotel and served us in the true spirit of care and hospitality. I would like to thank them for their splendid service which spoke volumes of the Hotel and their staff. Indeed, both should be commended and deserve some recognition for their service and professionalism which elevates the fantastic quality of the hotel and their staff. I would recommend this hotel anytime
2
There are many more places to visit in Singapore than Lime. The service is poor.When we walked in - a chap in a dark suit showed us to a table and assumed we were having buffet without asking and then only on request gave us one drinks menu - not really a welcoming gesture!?Service was generally very disinterested and food only average especially for a hotel. Certainly will not be returning to this place as other places to go in Singapore
5
Great selection choice and inviting presentation! Attentive service! A bit pricey but quality ingredients and service cost money so happy to pay for that! Noisy since open to public on ground floor! Not so happy about that but comfortable dining experience anyway!
5
Excellent service - just confused. Sitting next to glass wall panel - can feel Eco that really disturb us. Why not look into this - May be 40% curtain will help from top. Really dislike Eco.
4
wide variety of dinner buffet from western to eastern food. From steak to sushi. All of them are tasty. Good value for money.
5
Usually not a fan of hotel restaurant but Lime is an excellent opportunity to ally buffet and good food... Very big, a bit noisy and not cosy but great food at good value for money...

Come early to avoid disappointment. You'd be spoilt for choice with many live stations to choose from.

Went for their lunch buffet with a bunch of girlfriends! They had a promotion for every 3 paying pax 1 eats for free! We paid $54 each (for the 3 of us). When we walked in the place, am super attracted to that green tea fondue! They have their desserts counter displayed at the entrance, which looks super pretty and tempting! They have green tea cake (which taste so soft & amazing), Hazenut cake (which taste like Ferraro Rocher), 2 types of icecream - raspberry sorbet / triple choc that comes with a variety of toppings to go with!!!It was their peranakan season, they have this section with the different types of food like the kuehs, bo bo cha cha and make your own rojak counter, only thing is they don't have youtiao for the rojak mixing.They had some Chinese food, which I only took their double boiled soup( it's ok not fantastic). But I didn't want to waste my stomach space for it.Look out for the lamb counter, there's a guy giving it out when we hover near the counter. Do check the cuts of your lamb, because it's quite rare, I've gotten part of the lamb which is quite hard to cut. But my friends who gotten a good cut all say good things about it.There's the usual salad bar, cheese bar which had 2 types of cheese, bread and spreads. I only took some cheese. And I went to the seafood section!When it comes to buffet! Go for what's worth the buck! The oysters!!!! The salmon is not bad, but I would still suggest the oysters!!!I also want to mention their chairs. I sat on the sofa with 2 round tables, was so comfortable! Except the 2 tables seems quite awkward. Anyway will recommend this place to my friends! Their interior is quite unique and their vases if you notice at the dessert counter, the vases are custom to fit onto the logs! So amazing!Would love to go again

i came with my girl friend to dine in lime restaurant. first the ambiance of the restaurant is very good and specially my girl friend love the place so much. The taste of food is really good. beside that this is first experience in lime restaurant, one of the staff MR Aru gave us fantastic service with sufficient information about the restaurant and hotel. Thanks to Mr Aru for sure i will come back again. feel worth for the money

We celebrated my daughter's birthday at Lime Restaurant. Very good ambiance, good and tasty food and superb service by the staffs especially Aru. He made our dine-in experience above our expecations, it was a magnificent service! He knows what we needed without asking him at all. A very good connection his showing to the guest. He made my daughter's birthday the best day ever. I would definitely recommend this Restaurant to all my relatives and friends. TWO THUMBS UP!!
5
The dining layout is stylish and modern seats beautifully spread through the dimmed area. The glass windows, the plants and the city lights were a nice compliment to the dining experience. Buffet has a wide array of selections from salads, bread, rice, pasta, seafood, desserts having an international menu of palatable dishes and yummy treats. Their green tea fountain chocolate fountain with marshmallow is a must try!Recommending this to all who loves good foo
5
Good food and great beverage! Nice ambiance and decor. A good place for a business meal, meeting and to catch up. The non alcoholic house drink the lime juice was very impressive and addictive. The Peranakan food is also not too bad. Impeccable service from Yus and Aru
5
One of the best breakfast buffets, well presented in a modern way, well stocked with fresh produce and an egg station that was wonderful
5
Stylish, smart great menu and fabulous staff.something for everyone on the menu, presented perfectly on every occasion, any Michelin chef would eat here!
5
The quality and ambience, we had breakfast each morning and drinks in the evening. Staff are amazing.
4
This is on the ground floor of the new Park Royal. I was there for a business lunch.
The Nasi Goreng is excellent. However, there only two cuisines represented in the entire menu. A better selection was expected.
2
It is a big place. Food is poor I had breakfast a few times and found the food tasteless every morning.
5
first class food and service varied choice of hot and cold food
All requests granted and served with a smile
3
This place is expensive by Singapore standard. While the buffet offers good variety, we cannot say the quality was good.The seafood offerings were dry, not fresh and juicy. Cooked food were over cooked, cakes and dessert were not good too.And the service was poor. We had to ask repeatedly for things like water, coffee, tea... Not fitting of the $100+ price tag
4
Loved the lunch buffet (though quite spendy). Great variety of foods famous in Singapore. Disliked that we were told no tables available that they were all reserved for conferences and shuffled off into a corner at a bar seating area and told we may want the a la carte menu (likely because we were dressed in our comfortable tourist clothes). After being seated in the corner we mentioned that we were guests and asked if we could put this on our room. When they went to look and found we were Club Level guests they immediately moved us to a table by the window. Did not like that they seemed to pre-judge us and our ability to pay for the buffet and stuck us in a corner until they realized we were not destitute vagabonds. I understand that hotel guests should have priority (and am grateful that we had this) but if this is how everyone is treated who doesn't show up in a suit I think it is sad
3
Love the hotel but thought the buffet left a lot to be desired. Not great options if you are looking for healthy salads and other grilled oods. My freinds who ahd desserts said there was hardly any choices and what there were had empty plates..So service needs some improvement
5
I like restaurants that serve their real purpose - - good food in a clean, practical, uncluttered setting. The lights are just bright. The wait staff are not annoying, and always attentive while not being obtrusive. I like no-nonsense restaurants that won't make me pay for the trappings. Yet there is elegance in its simplicity. I love this restaurant
5
Also mentioned in the hotel comment, we had 2 days breakfast here as it was so comfortable and had so many variety.
You can just relax and enjoy western style or chinese style breakfast in a good condition.
3
Noisy, tables in rows, efficient but soulless service. Horrible rushed atmosphere because of people moving around to get to the buffet. A la carte food is nice but its not particularly cheap. With so many fabulous restaurants in Singapore, this one is only average
4
We enjoyed the extensive choice of fresh fruits as well as the variety and freshness of the breads and pastries on offer. The space was beautifully designed and the atmosphere and service impressive.

It was a last minute plan less than a week for me to organize a dinner for 37 people to celebrate my brother's ROM Celebration at the LIME Restaurant recently .Went on a early Monday morning and was attended to by a nice staff (did not get her name) who showed me where I can host my dinner and prompt follow up by her colleague Nikko in email to me to confirm my booking . Thank you ! All my guests plus myself enjoyed ourselves with the wide spread of food under the Peranakan & International Buffet and the way the food was spread around , fresh seafood like oysters , sashimi and there are so many types of desserts to choose .very good food and nice ambience that my guests enjoyed the place that they stayed quite late till the end of buffet....I saved money too! UOB Promotion buy 3 get one free and child above 6 to 12 years pay half price plus free for child below 6 years which make the buffet value for money !!!The table arrangement set up was good especially for a big group like mine as the restaurant was able to provide the round banquet tables for my guests to sit around big round table to eat and chat at the same time and using colored lamps to identify which tables belong to which group of diners. A BIG Thank You to Marie for the table arrangement set up and who was working on the day of our dinner that everything went smoothly : )Finally to the team of staff & chefs at the Lime Restaurant - Thank you very much for the wonderful food, prompt & friendly service by the service staff to clear the plates whenever we finished eating and sorry for keeping you up late as we stayed till nearly 11pm

Lime is a great place for a quality lunch break by yourself or with clients, it’s in the CBD and easy to find, being located in the city’s hypest Eco-Design hotel (totally stunning!) the Parkroyal Hotel at Pickering. The decor is much the same as the hotel: very modern with lots of corners in the restaurant, each serving a different type of cuisine. Although à la carte is available, I tend to go for the buffet as the all-you-can-eat sushi and sashimi is excellent. Originally I chose Lime due to its convenient location, I returned however because of its design and sheer quality
5
We're Singaporean residents and I love hotels-buffets. I've try Lime Rest. during weekdays. The sitting concept is very friendly with a subtle mix of tables and counters-sittings. Interior design is amazing, a mix of wood, mirrors and natural stone; so trendy !Dishes selection and their realization seems to follow the same way : subtle mix of savors ! Many hotels-buffets in town offers a mix of international and local cuisine. Most of the time it's ok and no more : quantities are provided but don't expect any more about the taste;The opposite experience happened to me in Lime Restaurant : all dishes I've try was a regal for the palate.Choice of dishes is very extended among them very tasty Pacific oysters.I recommend warmly that place !Weekdays lunch : 48$++ ( tea/coffee included 
3
I have eaten in the Lime Restaurant a couple of times trying both the "A la carte" and buffet menus. The buffet has a reasonable selection and I went for the sushi. The cooked meat selection was a little dry. It was all okay - but nothing to write home about. The restaurant is part of the Park-Royal on Pickering but there are plenty of better restaurants in the area.Service was good with pleasant staff
3
We went to Lime restaurant on a weekday with our family after reading good reviews online.The restaurant's theme was Nonya food and they also serve international cuisine at the same time. But the spread was more than disappointing.For a start, one can only wait for 3 oysters to be opened at a time... Unlike The Line, I find that the restaurant was not generous with their oysters... Making diners wait and subject to 3 each time. Furthermore, the oysters that were given to me were pathetic... Thus, I didn't even bother to go for second helping... This is also evident as the queue was never too long. Tuna and salmon sashimi was acceptable.Next, the Babi ponteh (Nonya pork) was unpalatable with extremely tough meat, cold ngoh hiang and wings. This is the first time that I did not attempt to try as many dishes as I can in a buffet. I was looking forward to bur bur cha cha for dessert. Guess what, upon removing the lid, I realised that it was pulot hitam instead! Overall, food quality is acceptable only and definitely not a Die-Die must try place.I also noticed that most of the items were not readily replenished or was only served once. For example, the durian pengat was served in small glasses, once gone, they were not replenished. Which makes think of those days where we could have unlimited servings of durian pengat at Asian. Market cafe. I think the restaurant did not prepare sufficient food as there wasn't really a big crowd on a weekday.The western dessert and fruits was their saving grace. I think this restaurant is over rated. For similar price, one can get a better spread of food at The Line, Shangri La. The experience at The. Line is completely different, even on a weekday. Food was overflowing, generous portions of sushi, sashimi, drinks etc.In conclusion, it's a restaurant that I have visited but will not visit again as I can get better quality and spread of food elsewhere

The one thing that caught our eyes as we walked into the restaurant was the matcha tea fondue, with its thick lime-green coloured liquid sprouting forth from the fondue fountain equipment. Strategically located in an eye-catching position, it draws your attention to the buffet spreads within. The open-kitchen concept, already done to death; was nothing new to the hotel restaurant diner. The food was laid out over five or six counters, each according to its food group such as salads, seafood, pasta, dessert, etc. Peranakan dishes, all excellent, shared space with the largely international cuisine. I cannot fault the taste of the dishes but I do feel that the fried chicken wings could do with less salt. There are improvements to be made though and some pointers that will enhance the dining experience of patrons are listed here, such as having a hostess at the open entrance of the restaurant. My partner and I had to walk in to ask for assistance. Plates were also nowhere to be found at the dessert counter, or at least they were not noticeable enough; so I had to walk to another station to get myself a plate. Food that had fallen off their platters on the buffet spreads were left un-cleared and slow moving dishes like the thai pomelo salad took awhile to be replenished. For all its shortcomings, there are positive points to highlight. The restaurant's signature lime drink was refreshing and cooling, the right concoction for our humid weather and the staff were polite without being intrusive.Overall, a lovely evening well spent in one of Singapore's sustainable hotels

When you entered the Lime Restaurant, you will never miss out a tall, green fondue. It is matcha fondue that you can dip with nice dried fruits and assorted fresh fruits. They have nice spread of salad, with different kinds of dressing, authentic peranakan cuisines such as Kueh Pie Tti, Ayam Bbuah Keluak (spicy chicken cooked with black nuts), Babi Pongteh , also their 'Udang Assam', very flavourful Tamarind prawns - must try. Seafood and salmon sashimi corner - serving fresh prawns, mussels, clams, oysters. My colleagues had a mini oyster challenges. See who can eat the most oysters. The oysters were fresh and not fishy and never failed them. Their savoury food tasted good overall. They also serve many interesting desserts where to ravel about with the excellent quality of it. Valued for money. Staff were averagely helpful. Atmosphere is acceptabl
3
Unfortunately, the service in the restaurant was not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel staff - perhaps we just ate there on a bad night.
4
Stylish, comprehensive and tasty lunch buffet which is their speciality. Excellent choice, although partly because of the choice, it can be a long walk from your table to the food, particularly if you want dessert.
4
Came to try their weekend hi-tea with my daughter and the food is nice. The spread is sandwiches, pastries, scones & macarons.
Really worth the price of $30+ for 2 pax. Definitely recommend to give it a try.
5
I really enjoy the taste of Peranakan food (Mee Siam).The best ever mee siam! The staff was excellent with service. Definitely recommend to my friends.
5
the price is good ,the food is fantastic, and the staff was very friendly. you have a lot of choice for the reasonable price
5
Completely blew my mind with the ambience and the service! Wide selection of tea and lovely display of sandwiches, pastries and macaroons. The service provided by especially Benjamin was attentive and sincere. Will definitely return to try their buffets soon!
5
One of the best buffets we have eaten in Singapore. Superb spread of food that is prepared at each counter. We love the attentive service. Overall good atmosphere and great experience.
5
Amazing range of food with committed chefs and waiters doing a great job. Really liked the hotel too and will stay again.
Expect 5 star standard and 5 star prices.

Thanks to 'The Entertainer' app, we are entitled to a 1-for-1 dinner buffet at Lime Restaurant in PARKROYAL Hotel on Pickering. It is serving peranakan cuisine cooked by chef Nancy Teo who has many years of experience. The matcha fondue was the main highlight in the desserts segment, everyone just whoah at the sight of it. worthy bites are the crÃ¨me brulee and freshly baked tarts in different flavours especially the key lime pie.The peranakan corner serving authentic peranakan classic dishes such as Kueh Pie Tti, Ayam Bbuah Keluak (spicy chicken cooked with black nuts), Babi Pongteh and many more. The best one I had was 'Udang Assam', very flavourful Tamarind prawns - must try.Seafood and salmon sashimi corner - serving fresh prawns, mussels, oysters and clams! Limited assorted sushi and they were all raw seafood on it. Thankfully, all of them tasted fresh & not fishy. Their savoury food tasted good overall. Some were slightly above average, while others fell short of it. While I feel the desserts were something to raved about with the excellent quality of it.

Came here for dinner and had an excellent meal - it was a set menu, so duck salads to start and steak for the main. The steak was fantastic and I couldn't recommend it more highly. The wine was also relatively affordable (or at least one bottle on the menu was), which was unexpected for Singapore! The service was also very good.The atmosphere is a bit odd. It's a giant glass room and it feels little bit hotel lobby-ish (which I suppose it kind of is) and the two person tables are massive and you feel weirdly far away from the other person.Overall - a nice evening with good food
5
We ate breakfast at this restaurant and it was excellent. The selection was huge with something to satisfy every palate.
We loved it.

What can I say....every detail was perfect! The food, the ambience & service! There is no complaint from me guys! U made my morning wortwhile!!!

Only had breakfast buffet but enjoyed variety. Teenagers happy so I'm happy. Staff aren't that attentive have to flag down for awhile to clear plates & coffee/tea.
5
We were having a farewell lunch for my friend and we have decided to celebrate this event at the Lime Restaurant. The moment we enter the restaurant, we are blown away by the beautiful structure and admire the ambiance. I just wanna share how lovely and Wonderful the buffet spread is. They have a total of 5 stations: the moment you enter the irresistible dessert will welcome you, here the green tea chocolate fountain stands out. The 3 live stations: Asian, western and cold kitchen. This adds a very big impact on appearance. Final station is the appetizers, cheese and cold cuts. The chefs are friendly, the staffs are welcoming and the restaurant was pretty crowded! Be back soon!

Lime RestaurantVisited the restaurant for the Buffet that was available for the weekend before Christmas in a party of four, of different ethnic backgrounds. The festive buffet [weekends and festive days in the pre-Christmas to New Year period] was essentially similar to the Christmas Buffet for Christmas Eve dinner with a wide variety of Christmas fare. Plenty of seafood – prawns, oysters, smoked salmon and relevant extras. The cold seafood was excellent with the products fresh and well presented, with attentive staff such as they provided a lime-water finger bowl for “clean up” after peeling the king prawns. Prawns were superb, presented on ice – and I am a bit of an afficionado of prawns! Oysters were fat and tasty too. Main meat dishes included the traditional turkey, baked glazed ham and a wonderful “melt in your mouth” rare to medium rare, sliced baked lamb loin - that was a standout. Plus a wide range of cold entrees – tabouli, hummus, other leaf salads and more. Baked vegetables were the accompanying hot side dishes. This was the western food choices. Similar wide choices were available for Indian and Chinese, although not eaten by me some others in the party commented favourable on both Indian and Chinese choices and their quality. Definitely able to please almost any taste!Desserts included bread and butter pudding made with an Italian pannetone base, several mousse and cake logs [dressed for Christmas], ice cream in several flavours. Fresh fruit and marshmallow skewers were available for dipping in the [obviously very green] green tea chocolate fountain. After all – it is Lime Restaurant!The meal was a great Christmas festive repast. And reasonably priced for what was on offer. Free flow of drinks, both soft and hard, including French champagne, available for an extra charge [normal in Singapore]. Highly recommended for the Festive season – and still a few days left! The buffet would also be something to consider for other festivities coming, with Chinese New Year soon. Even consider for Christmas 2014

Our family (17 adults and 1 kid) had our yearly Christmas dinner here. Yes, though it is not a Christmas spread it is a Pre New Year Buffet. Waiter service from the moment we walked in to the time we left were at the best, with special mention of Kimberly - keep up the good work. As for the food, the spread is wide enough and the quality and freshness is excellent. The cold seafood spread of oysters, prawns, mussels (one of my nephews first try and he exclaimed it is so fresh and sweet) were great; Japanese section of sashimi and udon were delectable; our stomachs were warmed by the wild mushroom soup and potato with carrot soup; the roast beef loin, lamb, basil chicken, barramundi in cream sauce were so good; salad was fresh and crisp; dessert of log cakes, bread n butter pudding, and green tea chocolate fondue MUST NOT be missed. On the whole, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Me, for one, will return to check out the lunch or dinner again
5
Had a dinner buffet with my friends on for Xmas. Food selection was enough to satisfy you. Cold section was fantastic and I think the cold section chef did a great job at ensuring fresh food all the time! Especially Chef Edmond was friendly and kind to present the dishes! Mr Peter and his team are very friendly and professional! For sure to visit again! I personally love the oyster, herbal chicken soup and braised pork belly. Thank you Mr Peter and his team for the memorable dinner

Came here for a dinner before in Dec and was a tad disappointed in the selections available. The food tastes great but you would get bored of the choices after walking around twice. The ambiance was, however, really great and the staff were generally very helpful (albeit a bit inexperienced/too eager to help).Our glasses never went empty because the waiters seem to always be watching our glasses with a jug of water in their hands. It really got a bit uncomfortable after a while because it felt as if the waiters were watching your every move, waiting for you to drink your water so that they can fill it up again immediately. Otherwise, service was really great.Some of the staff were a bit inexperienced though. When we asked where the washroom were, one answered with "uhhh, I don't know" and that shocked quite a lot of us. But otherwise, this is really a good place to dine at
3
The restaurant have nice ambience but the table location we had is too dim. Few selections for dinner buffet but we loved the seafood because its fresh and very tasty (try the ginger and chili) . I requested for the pasta but the lady chef forgot to serve it to me. I asked for the suprise bday cake but the lady manager said it should be requested 1 day before the reservation but "she will check if cake is available". The lady didn't return to me if the cake is available or not. Inspite of these dissapointments, I found the waiter/waitress friendly and very attentive. We went to the 5th floor of the hotel and impressed in the stylish garden with cages

Visited here with friends for a brunch and it was amazing. Great choice of foods, cooked as you liked and the service from staff was excellent. Suggest you go for the freeflow option on drinks but remember to pace yourself as there is so much to choose from

It is located inside Parkroyal on Pickering Hotel.
Raw oyster and sashima are very fresh and tasty.
I love the kung po 'zichar' from the open-concept kitchen.
It is a good place to catch-up with friends.

Had our buffet breakfast and dinner here during our stay.
We liked the design of the restaurant and the taste of the food served / prepared.
However, a little bit more varieties to the meal selections would be welcomed.

They had something to cater to all palates. The section with local dishes was interesting, featuring a daily special specially prepared by the chef. The cold dishes were superb and all others were top notch.

Lime has a fantastic breakfast buffet. Many choices, including custom omelet, fresh fruits, freshly made breads (my favorite is the apricot muffin) and of course pancakes, waffles, and a variety of cereals. Their lunch buffet was equally as tasty. I haven't eaten there at dinner but imagine that it would be just as good. The service is outstanding. Very friendly and efficient. Highly recommended

Stayed one week in Parkroyal on Pickering which I can't value high enough. Thanks to this stay I also discovered it's main restaurant, Lime. The atmosphere and layout is delightful. Its breakfast buffet is endless and covers a variety for all tastes. The best I've seen so far.

Whilst the food and spread is reasonable, the main attraction is the slick and edgy decor and vibe of the dark glassy interiors,stone surfaces and flooring wih high ceilings. The buffet layout is elongated. There is a good mix of asian(including sushi) and western dishes, clustered around stations. Desserts are limited

Sunday Brunch has started from early May at this newish Hotel in Singapore, now open for about 3 months. While Sunday brunch is quite an event at some of the other seriously upmarket establishments in Singapore, they have prices to match, although many patrons do rave about them.At the Park Royal on Pickering in Lime [their signature dining area], while the offering may not be as elaborate as some, it is a very credible competitor on both price and quality. At the current price of $S 88 ++ [non alcoholic] or $S128++ [with free flow of alcoholic drinks] it is excellent value.There was free flow of French champagne [Piper Heisdick NV the day we were there], plus a mix of imported both red and white wines of good reputation [which will change a little due to availability]. And there is also the standout signature drink of the establishment – lime Monet [non-alcoholic] and soft drinks for those not drinking alcoholic beverages.Food was excellent. In the group we were with, all commented very favourably on the foie gras, rack of lamb, and the seafood range, along with ratatouille, various vegetables, potato gratin, risotto, braised lamb shanks, roast beef, as well as a broad range of Asian dishes. Eggs Benedict was also available – just in case you missed breakfast! The actual food on offer will change regularly, so availability may not be the same.Seafood included a range of both cold and cooked items – with cold Japanese seafood options, whole tiger prawns, imported oysters, half lobster, among the cold on ice delicacies, and whole cooked fish, and a cod dish in the hot choices. There was a cooked prawn meuniere, although one person thought the prawns in the dish not as good a flavour as could be expected.A good range of breads and pastries were also available, although I thought some of the pastries appeared slightly overdone – just slightly so, not burnt. Included were several types of muffins – they were very good, as had tasted them earlier! There was a wide range of both European desserts – sliced black forest cake, baked cheesecakes, various tarts and pies, baked pudding and a few separate individual serve dishes of mousses, some plus Asian speciality desserts and cakes as well as racks of sweet jelly type lolly items. Several varieties of ice cream rounded out the dessert offerings [and it was cold and firm]. There was a good range of both hard and soft cheeses to go with coffee or a range of teas, to finish off the luncheon.Staff assisting at tables were attentive, but not over bearing, and very helpful and pleasant. No one at our table made any strongly unfavourable comments on the food quality. Staff performance overall including cook and table staff was really excellent – friendly, helpful, and broadly doing a very good job – definitely one of the stand out positives. It does help to have staff that adds to the overall impression.Definitely plenty of choice to eat and overall food was very good; service excellent. Would I come back? – Yes. Score 8.5 /10. It will offer an excellent niche alternative to those Sunday brunch events, costing somewhat more at other hotels. And it is located in a very pleasant setting, on the ground floor, with an excellent view to the water features and the outdoors

this is a very belated review of this restaurant which i visited in Jan 2013 with my mate. despite being newly opened and might be meeting teething issues, i was impressed by the food selection and the hospitality from the service staff. the savory dishes and options were adequate and the dessert spread blew my palatte away. keep it up and hope to have the opportunity to dine there again in my next visit to Singapore

Nice restaurant, and they were very friendly and really all out to pleaseThe place was very casual, and you have people slopping aroundFood is not great - ordered a buffet for one of us - averageAnd ordered a sald for another - the salad was full of veal meat and had no greens - strange
