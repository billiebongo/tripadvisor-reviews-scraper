I love ikea products. Durable and valuable. Colorful. Best gift ideas. Most of all the food in your resto.

Highly recommended restaurant after some furniture/ household shopping. Go for the poached salmon dish and chicken wings and Swedish meat balls!
4
Always the best chicken wings in town! Reasonable price and fast! Size of wings is good and always serve hot! The coffee is low price! Fifty cents refillable!
4
A classic place to grab some yummy meatballs and chicken wings, while shopping for your furniture and home decor.
4
The must try is of course the meatballs, poached salmon and chicken wings. But there are also desserts, cakes and salad. Free flow of coffee for members. Choice of soft drinks as well. Prices are reasonable given the portions.
4
Almost every time we visit Ikea we will went to the restaurant. Chicken wing, meatball & Daim Cake are the must ordered items. Tasted nice and most of them you can get at the grocery store too. The only problem is the long queue at peak hour

Ikea has earnt itself a weird position in society's game of social status. A Starbucks analogy wouldn't be lost on many from outside Asia, and may even bemuse the OG Swedes. Why would someone go to Starbucks? We know the coffee is poor, unethically sourced, overpriced, sending profits abroad, and killing local cafe culture and diversity. Here are a number of similarities:• Carbon-copy gentrification• Foreign owned• Insta-hip• Aspirationally middle-class (lipstick economics 101)• 1st rate branding as a lifestyle• 2nd rate quality as a fact• Unethically sourced• Begrudgingly accepted globallySingapore is know as a food paradise. Why would anyone ever eat the yellow food of Ikea when across the road is the country's most famous laksa (read Kantong Laksa Queensway)? Why would we drink Starbucks instead of uncle's bulletproof stockings? Books have been written on this phenomenon, and can best be described simply as "status anxiety". Singapore has no shortage of status anxiety, and Ikea has no shortage of restaurant goers.For the fill experience I recommend the free flow drinks at the cafe past the checkout. I found the sweetened "Nordic fruit water" to best wash down my hotdog and need to be exactly like everyone else

The food is delicious. They have the Swiss speciality meatballs. The meatballs are beef and chicken. You can have any choice. There is also dessert like Cheese Cakes, Blueberry cakes etc.. Free flow of coffee or the softdrinks. But very crowded during lunch time. Its hard to get a table during lunch hour. The ideas of the 3-step trays is a great thing. Because once you started queueing the long line, you cannot turn back and it will take more time to que again. Shopping at IKEA and having lunch at the Swiss Restaurant is a great match

This is my first time having my lunch at Ikea at Queenstown. At that time I went, it was a public holiday. The Ikea mart was really packed with alot of people. At the time of my visit, there was a really long queue going to the counter to order the food. My mum and I waited for about 30 mins to get to the counter to order our food. I ordered the Swedish Meat balls which is what Ikea restaurant is famous for and my mum ordered the chicken bryani rice. The hot and cold drinks at Ikea is refillable, you only pay once for the drink. I really like the way, how ikea's method of customers bringing their food to the table using the trolley. I found out that using a method like this, we all can avoid spillage of food.The portion of the food is quite big which is value for money. The food really taste great and delicious as expected. The service was okay. To sum up everything, I would say eating at Ikea restaurant is a good choice, but try to avoid going during the lunch hour as it will be very crowded

We ate here one evening after our Digital Travel Conference in Sentosa since this was just right next to our hotel the Park Hotel Alexandra . We enjoyed so much the Salmon, Chicken Wings and the Swedish Meatballs . To top off the meal we had the heavenly Daim Cake . That dessert was truly unforgettable
4
The restaurant is inside the Ikea in the second floor. The food is good. I tryed the salmon with vegetable and my friend ribs with french fries. The taste was very good and it was very kickly to get the food.
5
Look the menu is basic but good, you can takeaway in a plastic reusable container and it is gareth good food and a good price ... recommend this 100%
4
Good location with reasonably priced food and unlimited coffee/tea! If you spend more than $5 (assuming that you are an IKEA member), your parking is free for the first 3 hours!
4
Ikea is a one stop shopping place where one could sit down, relax and have some food in between your shopping. The chicken wings are great and well sought after by many. Household needs like furniture, lamps, cushions and even decorations, etc are all available here. Children can have some fun at the play area too..
3
Used to love Ikea local food offerings laska and nasi lemak but the standards have dropped significantly over past few years. I would even suggest driving there for lunch with my colleagues. But things have changed some years ago. The portions are smaller now and prices have increased. Their perennial customer favourite chicken wings and meatballs have also shrunk in size and taste less yummy. It's great that Ikea has recognized the problem and working to resolve it. I am looking forward to the revamped chicken wings. In the meantime, their smoked salmon cold dish and chicken chop are my go to choices whenever I am there
3
With Ikea Singapore temporarily ceasation sale of its famous chicken wings, the restaurant introduces a new menu Chicken Tenders with Fries. First impression was awesome especially with the amount of money paid. As I ate the chicken tender, I felt that the bread crumbs and the frying flour which was used to coat the meat had a mouldy taste. I took the second piece and same mouldy taste too. The chicken meat though was well deep-fried and tasty
5
My go-to place for affordable cafeteria food. I love the high school cafeteria system where we get to pick our own food and pay at the end. Best to go on weekdays if you value your personal space. Tampines IKEA parking is free- and you can even walk over to GIANT or COURTS if you really need to.
4
My husband and I are not ashamed to admit, we simply love going to Ikea to eat our meat balls with boiled potatoes, sauce and the berries. Sometimes a chicken wing or two as desert :)HOWEVER, Ikea, if you read this: PLEASE bring back the boiled potatoes! Its just NOT the same with the tiny little blob of mash!We are regular patrons and very loyal but the mash make us wonder....its just NOT the same :((
4
This was the restaurant that I had me first acquaintance with the Swedish meatballs. Love them so much and I kept coming back for them after my first try. Interestingly, the strawberry sauce complemented the meatballs really well. The other items at the restaurant were good as well. Most importantly they were priced very reasonable
4
I arrived here around 3.30pm thinking that since it was way past normal lunch hours, the Ikea restaurant would not be so busy. Well, be prepared to queue even in off-peak hours because the restaurant is always super-busy. I queued for 20 minutes before reaching the food area.The cold foods are self-service, while hot foods are served to you quickly over the counter. I ordered 10 chicken meatballs (comes with boiled potatoes and cream sauce), 2 chicken wings and a plate of gravadlax with arugula and pea salad (gotta have some vegetables in there somewhere!). The drinks are self-service and I filled a glass with sparking pear water. Prices are very reasonable at Ikea and I only forked out 17 SGD in total for all the food and drink I ordered.The chicken meatballs are slightly drier than the normal Swedish meatballs (made with beef and pork) but when eaten with the cream sauce are just as delicious. The chicken wings were excellent and crispy, while the salmon was pleasingly melt-in-your-mouth and went well with the tangy mustard and dill sauce. Ikea is always there for you on days when you suddenly get a craving for tasty Swedish meatballs that must be satisfied! :
3
IKEA style restaurant, food is very nice however the queues can be a nightmare. try to avoid rush hours
2
I've been coming to Ikea for years first you remove my favorite Diam cake now you bring it back and the slices are smaller Huuuum did you think we would not notice. I did and I'm not at all happy with eating @ ur outlet.
4
The fried chicken wings are one of the best you can find in Singapore. However the restaurant can be very crowded especially during weekends.
3
Nothing special. Unlike other Ikea restaurants, that one is small in size and overcrowded with people. I don't know why, but it did not bring typical for Ikea Swedish atmosphere. I would not recommend it to true Ikea lovers.
5
The food is quite nice, and the price is reasonable. It is good place to take a rest and have a luck after walk in ikea. Highly recommended!
1
I think Ikea should stick to what they do best... And not into any other things.
I tried their meat balls and think that it is a joke that it is on the menu.
5
Nice restaurant with some cool ambience. you have few options to choose from various cuisines. Enjoy your food..!!
4
Well done IKEA Tampines - glad to have a place where I can get almost everything essential for my house and have a place to have a up of tea/coffee or grab lunch/snacks - serving good quality food. The design of the restaurant is pretty cool! Just need improvement on the customer service of the staff - I feel a bit hurried getting the food and paying. Speed with a smile and friendly voice is possible in a busy place like this
4
The salmon dishes are surprisingly good and at a reasonable value. The gravad lax and the steamed salmon are very well prepared and served. Only point not so nice: it's too busy, a bit much mass market / cattle market people processing. Very limited atmosphere but the food was surprisingly good

When I first started visiting Queenstown district ten plus years ago (rellies live across the road), Ikea was a great novelty as we don't have it in NZ. The restaurant was a novelty also and we've eaten there from time to time at midday when our grandchildren were younger. On this visit, I had a hankering for fish and chips at lunch time, but I couldn't find anyone to go with me (they'd all got over the novelty). It was a bit of a disaster as the fish of the day was broiled salmon not crispy cod, the crowd in the line was thickening up and I felt harassed and disapointed that the place is so school-canteen in all ways.I dutifully ate my Swedish meatballs and pretended to be a busy office worker like many of the others. The meatballs may contain the sawdust from the Ikea factory, or something that in taste and texture resembles it. But that's being too mean. This restaurant provides wholesome, cheap food to tired shoppers in a clean and well-managed environment. Put up with the noise - this is Singapore
4
Ikea is known for a couple of popular food stuff like their curry puffs, soft ice cream and most of all, their wings.
4
One thing is for sure food is standard and good value. The bigger problem here is sometimes the line is long, very thankful it was short this evening.
3
My friend and I decided to hit Ikea and get our meatball craving fix. Ordered a plate of meatballs and wings to share. Always a pleasure. Reasonably priced and decent food. We ended our meal with their soft serve and took home some cinnamon buns.
3
I went to this place for lunch today. I ordered a salmon as usual. The salmon was a little dried and size got smaller than my previous visited. The taste of sauce was good though.
5
Healthy meal, sinful meal, they have it all, famous for their poach salmon, meatball and fried chicken wing. I like their cinnamon roll, smoked salmon and their veg rice. Taste yummy!
4
Always fun and relaxing to dine here. Our Favorite of meatballs and almond cake and apple pie. .. even syomay and potato cake. .. just like the practical arriving they offer
3
People would queue for the longest time ever for the food. The Craze is the chicken wings and meatballs. It is addictive. But sometimes the wings are overcooked makes it hard to bite. I hope there is a consistency in their cooking time. I don't want to be disappointed the next I am there. I love the salmon, mushroom soup. I am not sure if its the crowd or the food that's makes people willing to Q that long a time...But I love it
3
In the past, my family loved going to Ikea for their coffee and especially for their huge plate of chicken wings. Now their chicken wings have shrunk tremendously and we no longer order it as the cravings are gone. The boiled potatoes that are served with the meatballs were undercooked, inside of the potatoes were still raw to the bite. Their cafeteria food standard has definitely dropped. Saw a spelling error on their AS-IS corner banner, 'Clearace' missing the letter 'n'.
2
We used to love to go Ikea Cafe for its delicious fried chicken wings, which were juicy and crispy. It was also very crowded back then, but we didn't mind the wait as the food was worth it. However, as the years go by, the quality of food declined. Due to the large crowds, they began to operate it like a production line. Hence the food turned out to be cold and limp. As I was eating the lackluster food, I wondered why it is still so crowded. Granted, the food is cheap as compared to other places, but it's not that cheap to warrant the poor quality. Salmon was hard and dry. Mashed potatoes was tasteless. Chicken wings were cold and not crispy at all. Needless to say, we haven't been back since. Go only if you like your food cold. As for me, I like my food served hot or at least warm
4
IKEA is located nearby my place. Nice place to hang out for dinner with kids. You can stay peace of mind. Food is reasonable price with good selections. Sometimes they have local food like Nasi Lemak and Laksa being served. Consider good place, convenience and cost effective. After food, you can do your home furnishing shopping.
4
Like other IKEA restaurants, this is a good place to eat. The queues can be ridiculously long, but waiting time is manageable. Try the chicken wings or of course, the meatballs :)
4
Since my office opens a bit later, I like dropping by to grab breakfast and always end up getting something for the office. Standard might be dropping a bit.
4
The restaurant offers variety of Swedish food. With the IKEA Family card, you will entitle 1 free coffee or tea for each diner.
4
You have to wait in line on the weekend but waiting in lines seems to be a national pass time in singapore.... Well worth the wait for he food at IKEA always enjoy it.
2
If you like a plate of tasteless meatballs this is for you! Lots of shoppers here with children, despite being absolutely huge it is still difficult to find somewhere to sit.
4
Went here for Sunday brunch, and as expected, came away happy and satisfied. If you don't overdo it, like maybe having it every day of the week, IKEA food can be quite delicious. Highly recommend their salmon croissant and lasagna. As well as their cakes, that go so well with their coffee
4
I know it is busy everyday when people come here for lunch or dinner. So I went on a Monday and surprisingly, it is super packed. The food seemed to be mass production where the meat items were hard and dry. The counter where serving food was just placed on the top and just take & go. Food aside, service rendered was excellent!
5
Swedish meatballs is nice. Fried chicken wings good. Queue long.downstairs sells hotdog plus drink $1.50. Plus ice cream combo is $2. Cheap and good alternative. Weekends v crowded. Weekdays go after 2.30pm else no space. Now no more short cut to restaurant. Need to go one big round. Good to prevent so many ppl going to restaurant only, bad when after one big round then realize the queue is up to the entrance. So you are stuck either to join the queue or leave. At least there's still the cheap alternative downstairs. Also v crowded.
5
Ok, Ikea offers a lot of home stuff with wide range of variety and with high quality. Name a part of your house and they have something to fill it.Personally, i like their the design of their home furnitures. This includes the dining table, chairs, cabinets, etc. These are all engineered well to fit everyone's need.Baby, toddlers, youth, couples and old - they have everything for every ages.Lastly, we love the restaurant. Yum yum. The pork ribs is our all time favorite. All the desserts are very good but the almonds?something?cake stands out.Unlimited coffee for those caffiene addicts :)Offers non-swedish food like nasi lemak, spaghetti and others.Don't forget to sign up for membership if you are a regular costumer.
5
After shopping in IKEA itself, looking around for so many household choices, you must be feel so tired and HUNGRY! IKEA provides a restaurant and cafetaria. And if you feel want to relax and sit down for a while, you should come and try the unique foods in IKEA Restaurant
4
so crowded during weekend especially during dinner time even the area is big enough. I love their pork ribs, mushroom soup & meatball.
2
Poor. The food is ok however there are not enough tables set aside for Ikea customers. Instead the place is filled with local business workers. If you want people to stay longer and shop in your store, then set aside tables for your customers.
4
I never get tired of the Ikea Meat Balls the chicken wings.... I felt like a stuffed baby pig at the end if the meal one of those times you eat way way way to much...... I live it @ Ikea..
4
Tried the Nasi Lemak, nice. Portions ok n chili was sweet n hot. Good value for money. A lot of choices. Still crowded after lunch hours.
2
Went to shop for household items and I was craving some meatballs but boy, was that a disappointing dining experience. The restaurant was super crowded, ok it was a Saturday, but it was almost impossible to get a table to have lunch. The queueing system was efficient but being yelled at the aunties who managed the queues was not pleasant. Having to sit in tiny space with families with screaming kids just killed off any remaining appetite I had for this place. Good was bland and salty at the same time. It was a most disappointing dining experience. Maybe next time I should go at week days and not during lunch or dinner time.
3
A few years back I used to addicted on their fried chicken wings. That's addicted stopped when the chicken wings turned super dark which probably re-use oil. Nowadays, my favorite is Bake salmon fillet which always taste good as the first time I tired it. My hubby favorite was Swedish meat balls which years ago you may heard that it was mixed beef and horse meat which he was so sad to hear about it. So, he was stopped eating in Ikea completely. This place always hard to find a seat to sit and eat. You're better left one of the group find table and the rest can go buy food.
5
For S$49 you have a complete Swedish dinner with drinks and desserts.15 meatballs @ $8 & $10.90 for beef goulash with mushroom soup is a bonus. Its creamy poached salmon is light and delightful. I wish they bring back the beef steak they used to charge around $8.90 it is well seasoned and succulent. Regulars never miss their chic wings which is deep fried and finger licking good.To end the meal indulge in their almond cake @$3 with a biscuit base with light cream in between top with small almonds.Before or after your browsing or purchase of Ikea goods a good place to start or retire your wonderful outing with favourite food of your choice
4
Ikea food is pretty standard. Meatballs, salmon, chicken wings. The big plus in this place is you do not have to get out of the store to eat. We usually go to ikea for hours. Let's face it, an ikea shop swallows you up if you don't know the exit door. The place can get packed during peak hours but since they do have a big area, seating rarely becomes a problem.I love going there, the food is great, value for money is acceptable. Family friendliness is a big plus. One of my favorite places to eat in the area
2
We like to go regularly to visit IKEA to check the "tendance" and of course you will buy always something because it would be useful. After a visit of 2h you are hungry and you want to test ikea food court. Its a self service. You just have to ask for their beef bowl or some fish. Everything is frozen of course. No it is not for gourmet. Just to calm your stomac
5
this place is always crowded during weekends but i don't mind queueing to sink my teeth into good meatballs with heavenly mashed potatoes. the combination of the lingonberry jelly and gravy gives a nice touch to the dish. adding to the wonderful experience would be the refillable drinks station and free shuttle to and from the nearest mrt station during weekends
4
The signature dishes of IKEA worth trying even if you have nothing to get from this mega store. Meatballs and poached salmon with a curios of coffee. Must try.
5
Coming here on lunchtime was a challenge since it's hard to find a seat. However, it was so worth it. Best smoked salmon I've ever eaten and best swedish meatballs, too! Come early to get some seat. You will not regret!
4
It's been countless times have spent dinner at Ikea and all the time I've enjoyed the food. Meatballs are so good and they have this potatoes now with broccoli on it I like it so much. Chicken wings must try also.
4
Every time I'm in Singapore I'll be here at least once and will be shovelen those delightful Meatball down my Cajun throat.... An loven and enjoying each bite.... Will be seeing you again soon..👍👍👍
3
Perhaps I am being the bad guy, considering the earlier reviews, but this is what I felt. We had ordered a poached salmon (supposedly their signature dish) and a curry chicken rice...The salmon has reduced in size from around 2 years back with the accompanying condiments tasteless - used to be broccoli previously but now no more. The curry chicken was terrible - the chicken perhaps was used directly from the freezer without proper marination. The rice was thick grain and slightly under cooked. I used to have a very good opinion about the restaurant earlier. But this time was a real disappointmen
4
Whenever we make a trip to ikea , will visit this place though not lucky everytime as weekends it is usually crowded and no space to sit and with kids you dont have patience to wait and watch. Love their chicken wings, meatballs and chocolate mousse and best part not very expensive and if you are a member can enjoy tea or coffee at 50 cent. Try your luck on weekdays or early morning weekends
4
the food was yummy and the price was cheap, regarding the quality, size portion, and the incredibly satisfying taste. I enjoyed Swedish meatball with gravy and cranberry sauce, complemented with sweet and scrumptious cute looking pink marzipan cream cake. I had dinner at IKEA Alexandra Road and I also bought some chocolates + sweets at the Food Market. It was great!
4
visiting the restaurant uplifts spirits. its just something fun and to look forward too. its not that food is in its best. but the entire experience of ikea restaurants plays a greater part of it. the meatballs, nasi goreng and chicken wings are somethings that i look forward too
4
Dine here after shopping for some kitchen wares and this place really offer value for money food that's above average and tasty though not gourmet type. Personally I feel it's good enough. Coffee and tea for 50 cents, side drinks for a dollar and what more could ask:) Go for the Swedish meatballs
4
This is not a gourmet Swedish restaurant. But it's cheap and really convenient when you are buying furniture, towels, lights, toys, potted plants at the Ikea store. Portions are not huge so you can finish what's on your plate and not feel guilty about food wastage. My favourite is the smoked salmon with salad. I just add on a wholemeal bun and coffee and maybe a smallish slice of pie.A complete satisfactory meal at below SGD15. Hot drinking water is free. The only drawback is the long queues in the weekends at mealtimes. But parking is free and redeemable if you have bought items
3
Just right when you're tired walking through halls of Swedish carpentries, there's this restaurant. Offers selected meals in quite large portion for Asian. Avoid lunch hour, as people will crowd this place. Search for alternatives nearby.
4
Good value for food and good service - self service. A good variety of food avaliable and all ready to go. It's a good place to meet others.
Very popular.
4
We have eaten here several times and found the food tasty and affordable. It tends to get crowded on weekends. You can even get discounts and free parking with the Ikea family card!
3
The meatballs are nice with the jam. Love the potatoes. The chicken wings though taste normal to me is a hot favorite among guests. Crowded almost on all my trips there. Self service restaurant.
4
The place is often crowded with families and office staff during lunch time and evenings. Despite the crowd there's still a kind of relaxed vibe about the place. Nevertheless it's best to go early if you would like to get a table comfortably. Since the Tampines store opened, we've been going there.Whenever I'm there, I usually go for the meatballs with delectable berry sauce. Hubby goes for the smoked salmon for his starter. The baked salmon is also a favourite with my mum. You will also find the chicken wings a hot favourite with piles of it found on many tables!
2
The food was average and nothing really special, while the cost for menu items were a bit inflated for the quality. The cafeteria style restaurant is jammed packed with people and there is not enough seating to accommodate, yet they keep ushering people in knowing they will get their food and wander around for long periods of time trying to find a place to sit. We tried the fried chicken wings and french fries. The wings had that stale burnt oil taste, while the fries were completely cold and soggy like they had been sitting on a plate for hours before serving--because they were. The food servers, in this school cafeteria style lunchroom, pre-dish out the plates of most food items in an attempt to quickly serve the flock of patrons that swarm this establishment. Therefore, the food sits plated and getting cold. After we navigated the line and paid for our food, we came upon empty utensil bins, and when trying to find help to address this, we were met with blank stares because of the language barrier, and it took another 10 minutes to get forks, which you literally had to search through to find one that did not have caked on food--disgusting, and I used hand sanitizer to re-clean them. After walking around for another 10 minutes trying to find a place to sit, we stumbled on a filthy table and quickly made a mad dash for it. Will likely not return to this cafeteria--it is not a restaurant
4
When you visit IKEA for your ready-to-assemble furniture, appliances, and home accessories; you would think that the company is the world's largest furniture retailer with modern architectural designs for various types of appliances and furniture, and its interior design work at lower prices! But you must also note that every IKEA store includes a restaurant serving traditional Swedish food, including potatoes with Swedish meatballs, cream sauce and lingonberry jam, although there are variations in some other country(s). In addition to this yummy meatballs there are refill tea, refill coffee and refill soft drink, condiment bar is always full and ready here in IKEA Singapore (Alexandra).Most people (name me as one of them), visited IKEA restaurant [only] for the Swedish meatballs instead of the furniture shopping.. oops... enjoy
4
Conveniently located on Alexandra Road. Well connected by buses and trains in addition to free shuttle buses that run along designated routes on weekends. Food is good and reasonably priced for the value it provides. Queues can get long at times but food is served fairly fast
5
It’s the poached salmon that I'd been eyeing, that yummy looking dish with the yellow coloured sauce. Costs 8 SD which is great for the value. The cafe closes at 10 pm, but on a busy day I'm scared they might run out of the dish I crave - so I reach early in the evening. The restaurant itself has a vibrant buzz and there’s heavy movement of men, women, children and food. See arunsikka.blogspot.sgYou pick up your tray, go along swiftly moving queue – grab a salad or dessert if you want and then in the cafeteria style counter ask for the poached salmon – a fat portion served with boiled veggies and boiled potatoes. I wait for him to pour a ladle of the yellow sauce – it’s 'chives sauce' according to the IKEA website, and it’s light and just the right thickness - over the salmon, before rushing to the payment counter and over to our table.It’s glorious, the dish. Fresh, juicy and pink on the inside, it’s a complete meal of protein, carbs and omega 3.Other attractions – the mushroom soup and the black coffee are also great. And then the atmosphere - there’s a vibrancy that so encourages philosophical discussions, only you must raise your voice to hear yourself.What’s lacking? Oh, the washroom – it’s always wet, and inspite of giving repeated feedback, doesn’t match up to what you'd expect of the hygiene levels in either Singapore or Sweden.Bottom Line - Go and eat at the Ikea cafe. Period

Went there on Friday 21/06/13 evening and it was packed till the brim... queue was badly managed and the plates of food were stacked as if they were free.. I had the poached salmon and it was cold and flaky. meatballs were bland and the pasta were poorly cooked. the dish which saved the day was the chicken wings. They were served piping hot and as delicious as ever.. probably the only dish which maintained its standard.. skip the meatballs and the salmon.. just go straight for the chicken wings.
4
Try the meatballs and the salmon. Worth the money and food nicely done. the mixed vegetable was a disappointment though.
4
Quite nice food offered and the price not too expensive. But it does get horribly crowded during peak hours.
4
Really like the fried chicken wings, the smoked salmon, the dessert as well as the steak and fish and chips. Only have to wait really long and really grab a seat.
4
Now this is what I'm talking about meat balls meat balls meat balls. This is always a great food to have, enjoy having this food at anytime.
4
Buy ikea meatballs! Very yummy and the potato that comes with it was also super awesome. Filling snack on the go.
4
Its not fine dining but the food is quite good (especially the meatballs and chicken wings) and its fast service and reasonably priced. Good for a quick or family meal. Only that it gets really crowded on weekends.
4
Has been coming here for ages. Has never been dissapointed with their service and food served. Value for money. And there will always be some knick-knacks that will catch your fancy while strolling out after a good meal...
5
You see from the crowd at meals times that this restaurant is a top favourite. Good taste and reasonable priced. Expect to queue a bit!
5
I just love this store so much. If you go here on the weekend, They have this free shuttle service from certain area. Be sure to Check the schedule for the arrival. Even the local didn't know about this free shuttle service.
4
this place caters to families but be prepared to queue for food and table. prices for food are reasonable and you end up ordering a lot of food actually. having said that, make sure you order the chicken wings. if you are an IKEA member, you enjoy discounted members' meal
5
If not for the very long crowd on weekends, dining is quite good. I like the meatballs with jam and gravy best!
2
the chicken wings is the only okay dish..the rest taste like plastic and fake food..not worth it trying.. The best in Ikea for me is the $1 hot dog.. so worth it trying!
4
I would not go to Ikea to eat there, but handy if you are there over lunchtime. Prices are cheap; food is pretty good.
3
The nicer foods are the chicken wings and the salmon cold appetizer. Drink are free flow for very cheap pricing.
3
If you fancy Swedish meatballs rather than chicken rice this is the place to go. It's consistent, just as you expect, with all IKEAs throughout the world.....clean and neat.
5
Clean, nice affordable food, cafeteria line, clean up yourself. Not sure whether I feel like I'm back in school or experiencing a very lax prison eating area. Whatever it is, I'm definitely eating at an IKEA restaurant again!
5
The food there are great!, the price above food courts, but below restaurants. Recommended to go there!.
4
My review is on restaurant at Ikea Tampines. The food is nice, especially the chicken wings and the smoke salmon. Drink are free for members, and after shopping, it is a nice place for taking a meal. But remember, weekend is full of people and with the long queue, you may have to wait a while. But in all, it is still a nice place to dine in. The drinks are free flow and if you are going to have chit chat session with friends during weekdays, it will be great because you can chat there very long and one more good thing is, parking is free !!
4
It is a self service restaurant with always huge crowd regardless the time you go.Be patient and also to find a table!Swedish meatballs are great with the cranberry sauce. It can be ordered as a main or side dish - you choose the size of the serving. Also good salmon or other dishes, changes by season! Not expensive. Clean environment.
5
IKEA singapore serves amazing local cuisine with a special twist of Swiss blend Singapore flavour. Its daily menu comes with special highlights such as salmon potatoes, swiss meat balls, chicken rice, spaghetti sets and more to draw your hunger within you through your naked eyes! Pretty looking deserts arrayed at the counter might be tempting, but IKEA fried chicken wings will spellbound you with an awesome aura once you use your teeth to cut into its juicy hot wings. When you are done with your meal, you can choose to walk in the mall to pick up some cheap items as gifts and do your payment at the main counter - [HIGHLIGHT] that's the place where you will find IKEA all-time-famous hotdog bun and a coke at an unbelievable price just right before your eyes. My humble advise - eat it

Whenever we went to IKEA for shopping, we definitely have to stop by the restaurant. Where else can you get such delicious chicken wings, fresh shrimps, best meat balls? Simply fantastic!
5
I visit IKEA almost every month, not for shopping furniture but for eating. =)
I love the meatball so much, and the cranberry sauce just makes it perfect!
Don't forget to try the 90cent chocolate mousse! It's heavenly!

For all who miss Swedish / north European food. this little oasis brings back memories for all, who once traveled Scandinavia.

At IKEA Tampines, Halal specials for Muslim customers were served at Line 3. Halal Chicken Wings and Swedish meatballs. Halal Corner for Muslim shoppers to have some food. Be aware to look out for the Halal line when queueing. Although non-Muslims were also seen at the queue. The pricing -$8/15pcs ,$5.50/10pcs for their Swedish meatballs

It is a self service restaurant. There is always a crowd regardless of when you go. So just be patient & join the queue. It can be very crowded during weekends. Swedish meatballs are great with the cranberry sauce. It can be ordered as a main or side dish - you choose the size of the serving. Not expensive. Clean environment
4
Apart from the perpetual crowds, Ikea restaurant will always be a favourite of mine. From the constantly reviewed menu items, I enjoy the family settings the restaurant gives. Prices are also wallet-friendly. Possibly one of the last few "free-flow" drinks restaurant around. A cup of soft drink just costs $1 and allows for refills!

Must Try in their Restaurant:Chicken Wings -YUM!Swedish meatballs Dark chocolate cake50c coffee!!Try to visit Ikea regularly to see what are those items they've marked down... they do change the prices often (last year price vs this years price). They also have "as is" section that honestly is not bad at all... at least for some items.If you see an item that you want on sale, grab it. Don't think twice. You'll never know when its going to be on sale again

"A hungry man is an angry man" ought to be drained into the minds of those who serve food behind the counter front & also at the cashier end. Fortunately, I am not this kind of man but i control my stomach not the other way round. Those who serve food were enthusiastic and cheerful when they asked what dish to select despite a busy crowd. Kudos to the team. However, when i bypassed & collected my food on the trolley, I had no choice but to go through the lady cashier to either pay for my bills or to order for my hot beverages. Unfortunately, all went well until I met her with a disgruntled face not only to me but to those patrons way before me. Not only her facial expression was disgusting, her tone of voice and the way she asked or responded were nastily rude. If not for all the many plates of hot dishes & cups of desserts I trolleyed, I would have just walked straight out, not paying anything & never come back to Ikea for eternity. Everyhting in her body cells are crying out, "I'm rude & I dont care about you customers". Ikea, we are at her mercy bcos we have to bypass her, there's only one lane with the metallic railings forbiding us to change alleys. Generally, I enjoy thoroughly shopping in Ikea bcos of this unique Swedish concept, never found in other mega shops. And i even encouraged my whole family of 2 teenage girls since young to shop here. Having encountered such nasty lady cashier, my mood has changed, my motivation has spiralled to zero & I have lost the spirit to shop there again, ever.

Stick to making furniture and get MacDonalds or Burger King in to do your catering. The food is either cold or the "cafe"is not very clean. It took me 5 visits to the store before hunger took me in to risk it. IKEA you own me $37.50, 45 minutes of my time and half a toilet roll - that is how good it was..
3
Atmosphere is not wonderful but the food is. The only problem I have had here is that it is always so popular and full. Very difficult finding a seat for lunch. If you can wait for a seat you will not be disappointed with the food.The hot dogs are great and remind new odd my childhood
5
The restaurant is neat, clean and very well maintained. The menu keeps getting updated often too! Great value for money!
4
The foods are not bad and cheap. We often go to Ikea Restaurant, or just shop the snacks or foods in their shop.
It's free drinks for members....Good!
3
Just ordinary canteen with bunch of typical grumpy chinese singaporean aunty serving you just like any other canteen in Singapore, nothing special as the food is also standard; set menu, kids menu etc..
4
It's reasonably priced & you get authentic sweden food especially the meat balls ...... I actually don't have much more to describe the food there but it's real authentic food yummy
1
Okay, dont't expect too much if you ever have to eat at the cafeteria, not restaurant, in either of the two Ikea stores in Singapore.
2
changed the recipe for the meatballs and they're just not really good any more. plus the food's usually lukewarm which just isn't appetising at all. don't bother with the hype.
4
Besides its signature meatballs, they also serve local food that are both delicious and well priced
1
The lay out is terrible, causing long queues and some food can't even be reached. Taste is terrible, service very poor. Better avoid.
4
I prefer the one in Alexandra as it is not as crowded as in Tampines. However, there are more selection in Tampines as there are Halah food for my helper.
2
Having used IKEA restaurants throughout Europe, sometimes without even visiting the store we were disapointed with the warm food on offer in IKEA Alexandra. It was not tasty at all, even the kids complained that the meatballs didn't taste like meatballs. The hot dog counter in the basement is much better, nothing you can do wrong with hot dogs, doughnuts and ice-cream I guess
5
TRY THEIR MEATBALLS ! It goes well with the gravy ! Something you should not miss when you're at IKEA .
Not to forget duck breast , the taste is awesomeeeee !
2
Just a functional place to take a breather, break for lunch or get a cup of tea after shopping at Ikea.
2
The food is cold and the meatballs taste different
5
Well, one of the main attractions of IKEA is obviously their restaurants. And when you mention IKEA -- Meatballs and Wings simply just pops up and this is a must visit place whenever I visit IKEA. Thumbs up!
2
I love Ikea but not the restaurant. Long Q , messy , crowded, expensive foods and it's take almost 2hrs for Q but have to finish the foods as fast as we can because a lot of people are waiting for the seats.
4
Packed on Sundays. Avoid if possible. Other than that, there is still a crowd but its manageable. The food is not spectacular but I guess folks go for the Ikea ambience more than the food.
4
My favorite part is one floor they make of a sample of simple design rooms from bedroom to one family apartment. Come with minimalist yet functional shapes , relaxing colour and compact design.
My only dislike the shipment cost more expensive than it's price.
3
Actually IKEA is a brand from Sweden, they sell home furniture and the like with minimalist style, also quite cheap price. The place itself consist of two floors, whereby on the 2nd floor you can see miniatures of small apartment uniquely designed by contributors of IKEA. Also in the 2nd floor, you can eat at IKEA food court (sorry I disagree with "restaurant" word), where so many western and non halal foods are sold.You can go to IKEA Alexandra by MRT and stop at Queenstown station. From there, make your way to the bus stop on the same side as Queenstown Police Station and take Bus No.195. Alight 2 stops later just before the IKEA building. The food court opens from 09.30 am - 10.30 pm

If I need a fast salmon fix and have to shop for my table serviettes, I always come to the Ikea Restaurant in Alexandria to have my plate of gravalax or poached salmon and boiled potatoes. For the price and taste, you can't get any better in Singapore
4
Famous for the meatballs package. It served in one plate contain of meatballs mix of beef and pork, boiled potato , cream sauce & cranberry sauce. The slight of sour from cranberry sauce quite unfamiliar to my tastebud. I think the savoury of meatballs, potato and cream sauce is enough.The meatballs package offered from small portion (for kids) for 5 pcs, and regular (6 pcs) and big (12 pcs). For 5 meatballs comes with price S$2.9.And suprisingly they have the best cake. A piece of chocolate & butterscotch cake is enough to wash down the meatballs. Mineral water is free.While eating you can enjoy the Alexandra road from the window. Sitting in the minimalist furniture that IKEA has been famous for after hours spent time window shopping at the store. I think IKEA really know the meaning of one stop furniture shopping
1
The meatball recipe had changed! It is really really bad. They didn't even tell people it'd became beef and chicken. It's not the original meatball. This is really bad. Better ask if it is the same meatballs before you order.
4
I love the Meat Balls they are totally mouth watering good
4
Excellent ! Seems like the chefs at the restaurant know how to prepare the most favorite Singapore snack well. That is, the deep fried chicken wings. Oh, don't miss out on the Swedish desserts.
3
The food is cheap & good.
Not a place for fine dining, but if you do shopping in Ikea, and like a quick bite it is ok.
3
I guess they lost their passion in cooking. It was reasonably priced good food, but deteriorating as we speak. Last tasted their horribly cooked Swedish Meatballs and almost throw away the whole plate. But I pitied my hardearned money....
5
Great food at very economical prices! Only thing was that it's very crowded and queue is pretty long....worth waiting for!
3
Chicken wings are must try.... Visit the one at Tampines if you will like to have halal version of their meatballs
3
If I had to rate Ikea as a destination, it would be a 5, but as a dining experience, it squeaks by with a three. It gets the three because the kids are crazy about the hotdogs (not sure I know the ingredients) and they like the meatballs. The vegetarian spinach pancake was gummy and the spaghetti was over-cooked, the sauce did not get it either. Granted, I have not attempted the chicken wings, nor the salmon. This is owing more to the cafeteria experience equivalent to a Who concert... it's just not civilized! Perhaps there is some redemption in those dishes, I cannot be certain. Were I to be so stalwart as to attempt them, I shall report back. Needless to say, theoretical attempt would not take place on a weekend nor holiday. Ikea as a destination is brilliant, the reasonable answer to most home furnishing dilemmas. I don't want to mention the children's play area, as it is a secret weapon. Not to be missed, the Michael Jackson express, the free Ikea shuttle from Tampines MRT to Ikea. Worth a trip from anywhere
5
No doubt - you can get it all - tasty cheap[ish] limited menu plus - go on a Saturday and you get the genuine Singapore "book my table, book my seat before I get my food experience" seeing the selfishness is to be believed. But outsmart it! Enjoy
3
But make sure you go early! Or late. Just avoid the main lunch period. Salmon and chicken wings are good. Meat balls can be touch and go. Daily specials may be worth checking out. And now for Chinese New Year, cheapest Yusheng in town to S$9.80 only. Decent tasting too! Really
4
The food is cheap & good.There's also a Halal counter for us Muslims.
2
Why is it even operating? Who ever goes to Ikea to eat?
3
Liked the dish served by IKEA but hate the long queue and search for tables!
3
Selection is limited, The black coffeee too thick. The only food i like is only Chicken Wings
4
Cheap and nice western food in a nice clean setting. Great place to eat and take the kids along.
3
They served pretty good Swedish meatballs here, maybe due to the fact that they are not readily available in Singapore and thus, something different. The pastries are delicious too.
This is a self service outlet and price wise, it's reasonable.
4
Food are fresh and style is very western.
Good break after few days of fish ball noodle, chicken rice, etc.
Regret we found this restaurant after a full dinner.
