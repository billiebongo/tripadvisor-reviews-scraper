Very rude impatient waitress. Poor English. Food very expensive and poor value . $50 for 3 with juice drinks.Very bland. Many better food options close by and much cheaper.

Went there recently with my wife. The general atmosphere and settings are very typical of a local coffee shop where chicken rice is served. I ordered chicken rice with chicken thigh which cost S$6.00. Many other local coffee shop that I visited would cost between $3.50 to $4.50

Came for dinner on our first night as it was just down the road from our hotel - Naumi.It’s a no frills plastic stools kind of place but it was clean, friendly and the food was delicious! We had some starters and then the roasted Hainese chicken which was really tasty and is a must try dish when visiting Singapore. Incredibly cheap for a good tasty dinner in a lively setting.

Love the chix rice here! We took the set for 2 at $19.80. It came wt 1/4 chix roasted or steamed, oyster veg, tofu, rice, soup and 2 drinks. They hv a nice ginger paste along wt yummy chix rice chilli. Not sure abt the earlier negative comments. We received good service and it is group tour lunch stop for China tourists but they hv ample space. Go try and judge for yourselves.

I had the chicken rice here(without the chicken as my partner is slightly allergy to chicken, she has the normal rice) and some other food. The rice tasted quite good, with other dishes we ordered. all tasted like normal tze char, nothing very impressive. I understand that this is the famous Chicken Rice store, so probably that is the best one
5
Restaurant is located in a very nice heritage street. Fast and quick eats that will not disappoint! The chicken (roast) was so good and the serving size was big! Other items on the menu were mainly chinese, and all looked so good. I ordered the fried rice to go with the roast chicken, and it was perfect. I did not leave a morsel on my plate. Service was fast and efficient, no fuss. This restaurant will definitely make you want to come back for more

Unbeknownst to me before I arrived Singapore Chicken rice is a thing. Luckily for us this restaurant was just down from our hotel.The lemon chicken usually comes in a set but I ordered it individually. Good nicely cooked chicken in a lemon sauce with a risotto type rice and a very small salad.Still the chicken, 6 spring rolls, a soft drink and a cup of tea for $12  - good value if you can ignore the sticky laminate tables, stained and broken sauce containers, the chef propped up against the fridge having a smoko and the lack of Englis
4
I had the chicken with rice (soup and vegetable on the side). It was about a year a go, but I remember the day perfectly (my memory plays like videos )I had to go alone because my partner at the time didn't eat meat. The place is kind of shared seating as tables are stuck together. I remember being nervous as two business men were next to me and the waitresses couldn't speak English. (And being alone definitely didn't help haha)However, the staff are very nice and the food was delicious! I was a bit confused about the money but the waitress kindly helped me. With the food the colour doesn't look like there's that much flavour but it's the complete opposite. Something so simple and yet the flavour is so good ❤️If I go to Singapore again it's definitely on my list as my partner eats meat now

Every time I come by to order a roasted chicken wing rice, I was told “don’t have”, but I can see there r a few roasted chicken hanging at the counter n many at the back of the kitchen. They just refuse to cut the wing of the whole chicken simply because u just order a chicken wing rice!! When u insist, they give u wing + breast meat. No matter how, u still need to cut the chicken to sell it as chicken rice, so why refuse in the 1st place!! In fact they don’t even deserve any star.

The Sin Swee Kee Chicken Rice shop at 35 Seah St originated from the first Swee Kee Chicken Rice in Middle Road way back in the 1950s. The Sin Swee Kee Chicken Rice is behind the Raffles Hotel at Bras Basah Road. The nearest MRT station is City Hall stationlThe popular Chicken Rice stalls are in Seah St and Purvis St. These are the authentic Hainanese chicken rice. Sin Swee Kee is crowded on weekends and also during lunch time. Both locals and tourists make a beeline for this shop when the stomach needs food. You can order pork chop, chicken rice, Thai tofu, chye sim and a host of other finger-licking dishes usually available in Hainan coffee shops.The price is reasonable and patrons are asked to pay the bill when the food is delivered. The service is excellent even at peak hours. Tourists are strongly urged to try the chicken rice here in Seah St and the quality is even better than that of Jonker St in Melaka
4
Chicken is good . We had both stream chicken and the one with soy but rice is not good as chicken. And don't forget to order Barley juice. Overall the place is clean and with good service.
5
We stayed at the Naumi Hotel, the Sin Swee was a very short walk away, the Chicken Rice as wonderful, I think I became addicted as I had it 3 nights in a row!
5
An alternative dish I would recommend is hor fun with eggs! On the current menu, it is number 65. If you like tasty food, this is it. 65番の料理を食べて見てください。美味しいですよ！
3
It is a nice chicken Rice Stalls but not that Hainanese as it claimed to be. There is an Aircon room which is not cold.
5
I like Chicken Rice, Come to Singapore, you can try a much different taste of Chicken Rice. I m a Hainanese, so I love Chicken Rice.
4
It is one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Price are reasonable and taste is delicious. Must try restaurant in Singapore.
5
Such amazing value for money. Had the chicken rice, mixed seasonal veges and beef ginger. About $25! Excellent flavours and fast service.
4
We passed by this spot a couple of times, and at one point, a taxi driver said, "This is good chicken rice." So we figured it was worth a shot--and indeed it filled the need for chicken rice while in Singapore (my boyfriend and colleague had not had it before). We ordered a set for three people, with the roasted chicken (I know, a departure from the traditional boiled, also an option), and a round of Tiger beers. And for less than $S40 total, we ate like kings on plastic patio chairs outside on the busy side street. The server was fine, if a bit offhand, but we particularly enjoyed the rolls and the steamed bok choy accompanying the main attraction. Yum
5
This is a small, open fronted hawker style restauant. I've visited both at lunch and dinner for meals, and although it's not open late, always had xcelleetn local Chinese dishes. I do not know if they serve genuine Hainese or not (in another review of this place) but I do know it tastes good. To a western pallette this is simply wonderful and cheap local food. There is nowhere inthe area as good in value as here
5
What a great place! In a small lane behind raffles just minutes from expensive overrated western chains is this great traditional restaurant. Traditional local cuisine that is simple, cheap, delicious and fast. $5 beers and great chicken rice. I had this entire meal for $9 sing.It's tasty and enjoyable I recommend that you can go slow and enjoy the well priced beer lah
4
Delicious cheap eat in expensive Singapore. Authentic local eatery full of people from all walks of life.
Service is efficient and brusque. Food is delicious, though portion sizes are on the small side.
1
The chicken was bony and barely warm, the rice was soft pulp and cold. By far the worst meal we have had in ten weeks travelling in Asia.
Much better in the next street!
4
A must stop lunch for us when in Singapore. Consistently tasty. I also enjoy the choice of vegetables with chicken - you can ask them to remove the skin.
2
This place sells chicken rice and other zi char dishes. Nothing special about the taste. In fact, many other stalls taste much better. I suggest not to waste time and calories eating at this place.
4
I see that the reviews of this place are very mixed, with the locals perhaps more critical and demanding than us tourists. I had chicken rice at Sin Swee Kee twice, it was very tender and tasty, although the accompanying soup (broth) was tastier at the nearby Chin Chin in Purvis St. The food is fresh, the place is no-frills but popular with locals - good for a quick and satisfying cheap lunch
4
We came here late at night straight after our flight arrival and the service was quick and we've got our food within 10 mins of ordering.We have tried:- two type of chicken rice (smoked and the plain hainanese chicken): both are very tasty with its chilli and the soya sauce, the rice was also not bad - morning glory: the samba chilli sauce with the Kang Kong vegetable, very tasty- the deep fried prawn in bean curd skin: a little oily but tastes goodAll these costs us around SGD 30 which was really gentle to the pocket considering how much food we had in us
3
Any local who has savored the numerous Hainanese chicken rice offerings in Singapore would probably rate this at most average. The chicken wasn't as succulent as what I would expect. The rice was fragrant but average. The soy sauce gravy that came with the chicken wasn't very tasty. The chilli was a disappointment. The next day, to satisfy my craving for chicken rice, I went back to my usual joint which is above the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. 30% cheaper and so so goo
3
The chicken and the rice are slightly above average; instead of the standard ginger sauce, they serve an interesting [green] ginger and spring onion sauce; the chilli sauce is tangy and good. Not worth crossing town for, but definitely worth travelling a couple of MRT stops
3
Not the best Hainanese Chinese Rice in Singapore but this place served the "better than average" version of this dish. We ordered the "Chicken Rice for two" package which comes with a small plate of "white poached chicken", a plate of green vegetable and some fried bean curd with a very good tasting spicy sauce. The rice could have be a little more fragrant but it is dry enough and it's not oily. Recommend for those who need to satisfy "chicken rice" graving when you are at the Seah Street / Beach Road / North Bridge Road area.

Sin Swee Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant is close to Raffles Hotel and provides a good, cost effective alternative to the many sterile and quite expensive eating outlets in the nearby modern malls. We were staying in a hotel close by and used this restaurant for convenience one evening.It's just an ordinary street place that the locals go to. It isn't a destination eatery and you're not going to get the best Chicken Rice in Singapore. But it's friendly, efficient, inexpensive and serves up very acceptable food.We had a lovely little supper for four sitting outside and watching the world go by. It cost 57.90 Singapore Dollars including service and GST. It was the least expensive meal we had during our stay in Singapore and we enjoyed it as much as any of them. Sometimes it's just nice to escape the tourists and pretend to be a local.This is what we had:Half Roast ChickenPu Pi PrawnGinger & Onion PorkFried Garlic ChickenSpicy Fried French BeansRice x 4Ice Water x 2Lime Juice x 1Tiger Beer x 1Give it a go if you happen to be in the area
3
Came here for the first time recently to try the chicken porridge. There aren't too many places left in the vicinity that offer porridge. This one was quite decent and remarkably inexpensive. Probably worth another visit.
4
Very good food at a local clean place. Friendly staff who spoke little English. No credit cards accepted.
4
Stayed for a week nearby and had lunch more than 3 times here. It was usually packed during lunch time yet service was fast. They served very good steamed egg.
5
We were very pleased with our dinner here. Good selection and good price. Stool seating but very authentic.
2
The restaurant was located on Seah Street adjacent to Raffles Hotel. The restaurant was some kind of hawker centre setting. Foods there just average quality without excitement. If you like Hainan Chicken Rice with good quality, this should not be one on your catch list
1
No customer service and the waitress has bad attitude. This is not the first time I went to eat the chicken rice there, every time I went they said no drumstick or chicken wing for Steamed/Roast Chicken around 7 pm dinner time. I totally understand because there is no cooked chickens hanging there. Today I went and tried my luck again. I saw there are two steamed and roast chickens hanging there. I said to the waitress in Chinese I wanted roast chicken drumstick. She said huh and i repeated it again even in English. She said no drumstick or chicken wings for Roast and Steamed chicken. But there are chickens there, are there all reserved? The waitress said if everyone comes here just ordered drumsticks or chicken wings how are we going to sell the chicken breasts. Really? Seriously? What kind of customer service is that?? She even said the customer sitting the table over there also ordered the drumstick and I told him no more.Not sure whether there is an owner or chef standing at the chopping board there. Staring at us and do nothing.If you guy really wanted to sell the chicken rice, pls focus how to cook well the chicken rice and manage how many chickens going to sell a day. Of course with good customer service. It is a service line, how come you guys ignored about it! This is the first time of my life when I go to chicken stall, they told me I can only eat chicken breast even the chicken are hanging there. Pathetic!!!
4
Went to Singapore thinking of Haianese Chicken and this restaurant didnt disappoint me. Aside from a very unappealing setting, every food that was served to us was sumptuous. The serving itself is not bad and good to be shared with another person. This is my second time in SG but it was a first for me at SSK. I would definitely go back if given a chance. I recommend this place to everyone who wants to spend a little less on food while in Singapore
4
Why, becausea/ Raffles ate all his money, andb/ He could get a good feed for less than the price of a Singapore sling!If you can brave the "foreignness" of Chinese Street food this brisk and brusque shop just a pitching wedge from Raffles Hotel and it has a complete menu with pictures. No fuss, but yummy local tucker. I had Chicken Rice, green veges in oyster sauce, and a Tiger beer for $14.50! But wait, there's more! A free bowl of chicken broth! (So its a bit hot, and busy, but I was pleased-that's travelling!
3
As far as chicken rice goes, it's OK. Can't complain but nothing much to praise on. The chicken is tender and is decent-ish but nothing much to shout about. A decent chicken rice store at the local foodcourt could give it a run for the money. That said the store has a very good selection of side dishes - pork chop, vegetables, fried chicken, etc. which goes well with the chicken rice.The same comment can't be said about the waitresses - not exactly the friendliest of the bunch. Come for the food but not for the service
4
I went with a bit of trepidation -- after all I'm a vegetarian! But I went with some friends because I wanted to see them enjoy the famous Singaporean chicken rice, and they claim this is one of the best in all Singapore (they visit Sin SweeKee every time they come to Singaproe!). So... yes, I ordered bean curd, and it was delicious. I can't remember how much -- with a bottle of water, maybe S$7? They all ordered the chicken rice, no bones, white only. We all topped off our dishes with the spicy sauce served at the table, and finished up with ginger tea (yum!). Would I go back? Yes, if I had friends who wanted to each chicken rice! Informal dining, on stools. Sit outside where you might catch a bit of a breeze. Do order boneless. And add the spicy red sauce for some heat! If you're a vegetarian, the bean curd was delicious, with lots of veggies. Just around the corner from Raffles (where we caught a taxi back to our hotel)
4
Sometime miss, mainly hit for hainanese chicken and similar other staples. Best for lunch rather then important dinner dates.
4
Always best to eat where the locals do, so we did and it was great, the chicken and noodle soup is beautiful. Very busy place, fairly basic but great food and very reasonable, just across the road from Raffles!
4
I have eaten here many times, simply but tasty hainanese chicken and rice. They also serve other dishes and it is clean, quick service, and good alternative to the restaurants in Raffles City.
3
Gone were the old days.. Swee Kee ... Sin Swee Kee is just and average local fast food place selling chicken rice.. Common, average... Nothing special.
3
I was invited there by my collegues. Let's be honnest : it's not the greatest restaurant in Singapore. But for a lunch at noon, it is quite good, fast and cheap.
3
The chicken rice here is not bad. The chicken is tender and the chilli and ginger sauces have a nice kick to them. The rice is less fragrant than in other places, and the soup is also less flavourful than I would like. Having said that, you can't really go wrong here if you are hankering for a quick lunch! The set meals are reasonably priced. Just $7 for chicken rice, a vegetable dish, soup and a drink
1
We ordered half a chicken roasted and other vegetables. Waited 20mins and 1st served as quarter chicken which was a wrong order. Returned and 2nd time the next order served was Half but roasted and white chicken. Returned again and 3rd time, it was served half white chicken. STILL WRONG ORDER! We finished the rice and ate vegetables! Left disappointed without having any chicken. Won't return anymore especially the 'foreign talent' staff were rude. Please do not patronise this place
3
Rude staff, would not go return for this reason. Foreign customers were rudely presented the bill while we were eating, they would not leave it on the table but shoved it in my face until I paid, this did not happen to local Singapore customers. The food was fairly standard
4
The 4 of us came across this eatery by chance after some shopping. Sitting space is spacious and cool. We ordered half a chicken with some other dishes. Its easy to tell if chicken rice is good....the chicken should be moist, even its breast meat, rice should have a nice fragrance and flavorful, not forgetting the chilli sauce has to have a punch to it. They had it here....as the food was tasty! Our sides dishes of sambal kangkong, prawn rolls, old cucumber soup were also good. Prices are also reasonable considering the vicinity. If you are hungry and in the area, pay them a visit....

In the 1960s and 1970s the Swee Kee Chicken Rice restaurant was a must visit place for us every time we were in Singapore from Malaysia during the school holidays, and the food was wonderful. I am of course older now but still as greedy, and it was great to discover the Sin (New) Swee Kee when I visited Singapore 2 weeks ago. I was on my way to visit the National Library when I saw the signboard for this restaurant nearby so decided to have my dinner there that evening. The two of us got there at 7.30pm and found a table with no problem. A young man took our order, and we ordered half a white chicken, a plate of liver/gizzard, fried bean curd, greens and rice. Twenty minutes later, a "foreign" lady came to us and in an aggressive manner announced that both the chicken liver/gizzard and white chicken were sold out and we had to have the roast chicken instead. I protested why it had taken them this long to tell us, and in any case, I didn't want to have roast chicken. In that case, she said loudly, we would have to wait another 20 minutes for the white chicken. I said okay. She then left us in a huff and took the chili sauce and chopped ginger from our table. When I asked her why, she said she was doing it as there was no point in leaving the condiments on our table since we wouldn't have our food for another 20 minutes. The food finally came and it was disappointing. The chicken was bland and the rice only had a hint of chicken stock. Considering there is a plethora of excellent chicken rice places in Singapore with friendlier service, I will never come to this place again
4
We went here because we were in the area and it was recommended on TA. It was very busy but the food was served fast and it was good food. There was good variety as well, not just chicken rice.
1
Chicken rice was pretty ordinary. The vegetable dishes were ok. But the chicken was terrible. We order 1/2 a roasted chicken and 1/2 a steam chicken. Hard to believe it was actually 1/2 a chicken of each.
3
Chicken rice was sold out? so I ordered the garlic chicken. It was good, but not as tasty as it could. Price: S$10
You have to pay when the meal is served - seems to have bad experience in the past?
4
This local restaurant in Seah Street,behind Raffle's Hotel serves the best Hainanese Chicken Rice ,($8 for 1/2 Chicken)on my last visit,very near to the "Toy Museum".
5
steam chicken was soft and tender, Hainan chicken rice was amazing, fried tofu and sauted vegetables were very good. Only downside is it closes earlier than all the restaurants and bars beside it
5
What can I say? it is so gd that people queue for it all day long. there are so many people who can vouch for the service and tastiness of the chicken rice.
4
chicken is smooth and tasty with rice, vegetables and soup and goes well with sgd1.5 ice calamansi drink but its quite hot with only evaporative coolers and the chili ginger sauce provided
4
Quick chicken rice lunch. good standard. speedy service. They have white rice without oil which is always a plus.
5
Right behind Raffles in the centre of the city is this gem. True to the flavours and styles of Singapore with fast service and smiley faces. We were in and out in half an hour (or stay for hours and enjoy the passing traffic) and only $8AU. 1 dish to share with rice and 2 lemonades. Tables inside & out
3
The service was very quick, we ordered the salt and pepper prawns which were delicious and were recommended on a previous review but when we asked for a cloth to wipe our hands we were given toilet paper. We had chicken rice which was on the bone and barbecue chicken rice which was off the bone. The staff were rather curt, possibly bordering on slightly rude. It was nice food but wouldn't return
4
Lunch time here is a great feast of simple and delicious Chicken Rice! No AC, but not bad under the fans. Great people watching. I can see why this place is a classic. The fare is worth it.
5
Almost next door to the hotel, this restaurant is well used by locals and tourists alike.
The food was very good and service fast, if not all that friendly. I would definitely return here next time in this part of Singapore.
4
Value for Price as good chicken rice and also some of the other dishes like Ginger onion fish, Pork chops are good
4
Had sambal rice with XO sauce, two vegetable dishes and salt and pepper prawns. All very tasty. Love how easy it is to sit down here and get good food quickly. Nice staff with a sense of humor.
5
Want authentic Chicken and Rice in Singapore? go here. Right next to the famed raffles hotel. Warning, the place is no frills (no ac and is pretty much as local as it gets. But the chicken and rice is off the charts. Food is good and most importantly cheap. Get there early or else they may sell out
4
Always come here at least once during our stay in Singapore, not only because it's near where we stay, but because the Hainanese Chicken there is delicious. We much prefer to eat the local food rather than at up-market restaurants. Seating is on stools and food arrives on melamine dishes, but don't knock it until you've tried it. When you see the large number of people that eat there, you'll realize the food must be good. Can't wait to go back.
4
The have expanded their menu, this restaurant is famous for their chicken rice, I think they should focus on maintaining the quality of their specialties and not try to be like some Hong Kong cafÃ©, because I tried their sambal kangkong and it was disappointing.On the hindsight, their chicken rice and their fried you tiao was good, though the chicken was quite cold..., their longan drink was really good as well.Service, friendly and welcoming.I hope they don't turn into one of those restaurants where they hire foreigners, and it completely changes the whole atmosphere and experience dining here.Thank you
4
This is another great place for chicken rice. Always full house for weekday lunch. Go there early or after their peak hour to grab a seat. Both chicken and rice are delicious. Tried their vegetable dishes, find it normal. The steam egg not impressed. Suggest to stick to chicken rice
5
We have stayed in Singapore a few times now and both times on our return to Australia we stayed at the Naumi Hotel. Just up the road is this fabulous place. Cheap to eat, great service and excellent food. Being one that loves Asian food this is one place I love and will be back
4
Judging by the crowds mid-day on a Friday, I'm guessing this is 'the place.' I sat curbside and it took several minutes for a server to approach me with a menu - I understood as they seem to be understaffed. I ordered the lunch combo for one - roasted chicken rice, chicken soup, steamed vegetables with garlic, barley tea and a side order of spring rolls - total bill $11 - very good value. The chicken was juicy and quite tasty. The rice and vegetables were flavorful and fresh. For $4 I got 8 tasty spring rolls. Now I know why this place was packed.
3
There at so many place offer chicken rice. Honestly, I really cannot tell the different. The one is close to my hotel and price reasonable.
5
Came back just to eat here! I love their chicken rice and pepper & salt prawns! Friendly staff too. Satisfied cravings. :)
4
Very busy at lunch time with locals so either get there early or late! Great Fried Rice, prawn wontons and noodle soup.
4
This was the perfect chicken and rice! We had the roasted chicken which was perfectly cooked and as tasty and juicy as chicken can be.
4
Had this for lunch with some drinks and a side dish which is surprising quite nice. Their roast drumstick rice is $1 more than the usual. If you want to add that side dish, can try their steamed trio eggs for $4.50.This place is cheap and good!
5
A perfect place to try authentic hainanese chicken rice in Singapore with prices that are still considered cheap. Located near Raffles hotel at the side of the street, it gives that touch of eating chicken rice like the old days. The chicken is serve perfectly, the rice is generous and cooked well, and the chili is fantastic. This place may not win in the service department, but don't judge them by that. Judge 'em by the food they serve. This place is actually clean. Come down here for a great taste of Singapore. But Remember, come here at lunch and early. the place can become very pack, and if you come at dinner some items may run out. VERY OUTSTANDING RESTAURANT FOR GREAT HAINANESE CHICKEN RICE
3
I love my chicken rice. So being in Singapore, I got extremely excited about this. I have tried chicken rice in China, Thailand, Malaysia and was keen on trying it in Singapore. I must say I was a little bit surprised. I was expecting better. I guess back in the day it would have been better. That is not to say it is bad. It was good, but I have had better
5
Situated on the back alley of the Raffles Hotel, it is claimed that this restaurant invented the 'Hainanese Chicken Rice'. While I cannot confirm this, I can attest to the consistently good chicken rice Sin Swee Kee delivers. It is a good place to get some food into your stomach, before hitting the Long Bar at the Raffles. Two complementary Singapore Classics within walking distance
3
Understandly the reviews below range from poor to very good n i m glad no one said 'best' n be rediculed! My take is foreigners whom have not been to other (best / better ) chicken stalls can discern between the texture n tenseness of the Hainan chicken n the ginger n chilli sauces, without which the repertoire is not complete. My opinion is its just average /not bad but not that great ! I found better n smoother at the more pipular chicken rice at maxwell n novena. Whatever if your hotel is nearer, don t hesitate to check this out before you leave Singapore. Happy eating !
5
I go to Singapore a couple of times a year and I always pop in here for a quick fix of chicken rice. I just have the basic plain chicken rice, with a side order of greens stir-fried with garlic. The bill for two of us is 14 Singapore dollars, which is a BARGAIN! I can only compare the chicken rice to the stuff I'm used to and grew up with in Thailand and I think it's delicious. I've never been to Hainan, where I believe it originates, but it's just really tasty. The rice is perfectly cooked, the chicken tender, and the accompanying bowl of clear chicken soup perfectly seasoned. It's like a big chicken hug! Great for a hangover too. The restaurant has outdoor seating, and there is a shortish menu should you want something other than chicken rice. Beer is served as well. Service is brusque and I only received a half-smile last week after quite a few visits. To be honest, it's not the place you go to linger or for the service so it wasn't a big deal
3
I was referred to this place because they specialize in chicken rice, which was solid but I didn't feel like it was extremely better than those served at hawkers.
3
Didn't have the 'buzz' Singapore eatery's are known for - we wer just about the only people there at 8:30pm! That - and a mouse stuck his head out from under the fridge (of the restaurant next door!)
5
Loved everything on the menu. Service was quick and the food was very fresh.
4
For 4 Singapore Dollars, one does to expect much. However, this restaurant delivers a decent Hainese Chicken for the price. To go with it, we also ordered vegetables like Kailan and bean sprouts. The food is brought to your table but you pay at the cashier. The ginger and chili dipping sauces were good, too
2
We went to this place to have some chicken rice and I can say that this is the worst chicken rice place that I have ever seen. The food was average but the service was atrocious! THey ran out of rice after 1 hr of operation and only informed us when we were served our appetizers. And the reason they gave was 'it was the kitchen's fault'. We had to wait for an hour for our rice but when they started serving rice, they served those who came later than us. In addition, when my mother ordered the Lemon Honey Jelly, the cup was leaking and the waitresses didn't realise it even though they served us the dessert themselves. I am extremely disappointed and this will be my first and final visit to Zheng Swee Ke
4
We were staying at a small hotel just up the street and found one entire side of Seah St is eateries (the other side is the back of the Raffles Hotel). Looking for an early dinner, we reckoned the busiest place would be the best, and this was it. It filled up almost to capacity within a half hour of our arrival, mostly with groups. Didn't try the signature chicken rice - but asked for white rice, which was not available! So had "Chicken rice" rice instead, very tasty. Had three dishes, all good, but one of our first choices was off the menu too, Very fair price.Atmosphere typical Chinese coffee shop, but clean and good service. No beer if I recall, which is a pity
5
I am reviewing (Zheng) Swee Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice located near the Arab Heritage Section of Singapore. I tried the Roast Chicken set. The Roast Chicken was perfectly cooked with that roasted taste one doesn't always get but they did the day I was there. Condiments were complete and delicious. The soup was particularly delicious, hits the spot, it seems to have some herbs in it not in the usual broth. The total bill was only $6.50 SGD so the price was right. I'd definitely come back here again
4
Again, this is a food stop for us in Singapore, we came across this restaurant by walking around the area and I must say a great discovery for us.For S$4.00 you get a soup, white or roast chicken with rice, great deal. We elected to have a half chicken, further halved into white and roast chicken with pi pa tofu.Best meal that is easy in your pocket too..
5
I have been coming here for more years than I care to remember. I have introduced my husband as well as my now daughters to this Singapore Hainan Chicken institution. $4:50 gets you a plate of the best, cleanest HC with seating either indoors or out. Quick, simple, clean and healthy
4
I went to the restaurant close to 2 noon, luckily no queue. I was not hungry at all but this turned out to be a really incredible meal and I ate like I was famished.This restaurant really deserves a comeback because their food is wonderful, tasty and unique. I ordered Hainanese Chicken Rice with Kampong Chicken, Roast Chicken & Orange Juice. I found the chicken very tender and succulent. The first mouthful of Kampong Chicken was mind-blowing. The rice is fragrant and sweet. Everything was delicious. The chili sauce they use was simply fantastic!So, I definitely recommend this restaurant if you really value authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice at reasonable price in Singapore
