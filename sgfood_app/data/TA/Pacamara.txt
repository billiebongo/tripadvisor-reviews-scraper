We ordered the pulled pork, the pancakes , 2 drip coffee. We were not disappointed. The pulled pork was one of the best that I had, pancakes were equally delicious. We went on to order 2 more cakes. Highly recommend.

First time visit as we were nearby. Big portion brunch and taste delicious too. Love the harsh brown, crispy yet not oily. Ingredients were fresh too. Really enjoy! Will visit again.
5
One of my favourite place for breakfast with family. Other good coffee and teabreakfast choices such as pancake and egg Benedict.
5
Always enjoy my breakfast at this joint. They are open only at 9am and will quickly fill up the seats. Many choices for breakfast and coffee is great! Like the pancake and egg benedict!

My friend decided to have a brunch at this place. That was first time to go there and the food was really nice and not too expensive. A bit tough to get there but it worth it.

Great food n coffee but gets very noisy over weekends . Eggs unfortunately were rather flat on taste (which is common in singapore)

The soup of the day changes each day at Pacamara. It happened to be Clam Chowder today, and since Clam Chowder is my favorite soup, I had to order it. Food & drink orders are placed and paid for at the cashier counter beforehand. My order was served with a smile. As soon as I tasted my first spoonful of Clam Chowder, I was addicted. Heavenly! Great service. Excellent food & coffees

This is a small cafe but the food is freshly prepared when you order your meal. Sometimes it takes a while for your food to come, but it is worth the wait. The dishes are unusual, but value for money. Food is fresh and tasty. Not too salty. Just right.I had the Crab Nicoise salad. Fresh greens, loads of real crab meat and a poached egg. Just the right portion for a light meal. Simply delicious.We were in a group, so everybody ordered different food. Everyone was very happy with their choices.I found the desserts too sweet, but I don't have a sweet tooth

Visited this place on a sat recommended by a Friend. Service is great, no reservations allowed which make senses as the resturant is not huge place with multiple seatings. Cafe is bright, with loads of natural lighting and neatly decorated. We ordered flat white, espresso and ice mocha. Great coffee, and they do their own roast. Food is fantastic. Ordered mushroom cheese omelette and duck confit with rosti. Very tasty and great presentation. We ordered chocolate cheesecake, looks good but the taste is pretty alright. Decently tasty but no “wow” effect. Only downside is the place can be quite noisy. Otherwise great place for awesome food and coffee.
4
Though the cafe is crowded, I got my table pretty fast. Was seated with other people and made 2 new friends in the process. I had a pull pork burger and my sister had an Egg Benedict. Burger serving was more than huge but it is a taste that all restaurants are serving. I don't mean it is not good but you don't have to go the Pacamara for a pull pork. One thing need to mention is that the service is really good and ethical. The truffle fries smelt so good that we have decided to add on to our order and was advise not to as we would be over-ordering. Instead, we were advise to do an"upgrade" to the normal fries that come with my burger. Best of both world

It's a corner shop at Thomson Road which gets quite busy during weekday lunch and weekends. We tried the Duck confit mash and wild mushroom alio oglio . The portion was giant for us, food decent but not like fantastic. Roasted coffee was good though.
4
Tried the Kurobuta Pork Collar and the white wine mussels on the new menu.
Looking forward to trying the other new dishes..
5
Be prepared to wait on weekends. Small but bright and cosy cafe with Instagramable melt-in-your - mouth ox cheek and duck confit. Good salads and cold brew coffee too.
4
Awesome place to hangout, a very optimistic interior design, very nicely spaced out. great place to talk and enjoy the food.
cold brew was a little too bitter for my liking, feels that it might have been a little over extracted.
4
Went there at about 11am on a weekday. It was half-filled. The white airy feel was welcoming. Friendly staff.
The cold brew was ok, appreciated the lack of strong acidic aftertaste.
The Winter Salad was awesome!
5
Yes a bit more expensive for the food, but coffee is better and cheaper than at the chains. It is bright and quirky inside, only come here for lunch. And free lemon water.
3
Their mouth watering truffle fries came in rather huge servings , topped with thinly shredded cheese! And it costs only $8 NETT! Ordered a Ice Mocha and Duck Confit too. Duck Confit came in a huge portion (value for $) but because it was too huge, finishing the dish became a chore after sometime, but nonetheless it was quite good
3
Pretty nice place . The coffee is speciality with some nutty blends and also some single origins ..Space wise it's a bit small not alot of decorations spend into it..Food I tried the Mac &cheese chicken it's a really good dish highly recommend it..Also avocado and eggs was good and healthy.If your going for food more than speciality coffee I totally agree

Was tempted not to write a review & keep this place a secret. But too late, looks like the word is out that this is one of the places to be at for brunch, lunch and even dinner.The minimalist design with the servers in white gave a very pleasant feel to the place. When you step in, register via a tablet the number of seats you required. Soon you'll receive a call, answer with a '1' if you are ready to take your seats. The server comes by, shows you to your seat & presents you the menu. Decide what you wanna eat. Go to the counter, make your order & pay. Then wait for your food. As one advert goes, so easy!Of course, one must have the coffee. When we were there, they had two blends available for the day. We ordered both. Both were good. If you like coffee, be sure to order the 7oz; 3oz is way too small.We had Avocado & Eggs and Truffle Benedict. Both were yummy! If you don't like poached eggs, no trouble changing it to scrambled eggs. Just inform the counter when you order.We saw someone eating the Duck Confit Hash; looks really good. Can't wait to be back to try it
4
We left our dog at the pet shop next door for a grooming session & tried this place for dinner. The food was really good & impressed us! The kids ❤️️ the BBQ Pork Mac & Cheese a lot. The pork was succulent & sweet & tasted like Bak Kwa (肉干)! We also shared the Crab Nicoise Salad (with loads of crab & my fav black olives), Sakura Ebi Taglioloni (reminds me of Mee Kia with plump, succulent prawns) & Fish & Chips (with yummy purple cabbage slaw!) which were all great too!
4
Apart from the delectable dishes that gave already been reviewed, I think one point that is Worthy of note us the quality of their staff. Polite and energetic which I think adds alot of character to the overall establishment.
4
l have been on french fries craze esp truffle fries!
i must say this Pacamara served one of the best truffle fries in Singapore. i hope they continue to maintain its standard.
4
Dined here a few weeks ago for brunch with my wife. Ordered French toast, avocado toast, hot chocolate and a flat white. The French toast was thick, fluffy,soft and drizzled with mapple syrup. It came with berries, marshmallows, hazelnuts and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Definitely one of the best French toast in Singapore. The avocado toast was tasty too. The coffee was excellent. Overall, the food was great and service was good
5
Enjoyable place for lunch, where I go once a while during the week when in need of exercise (15 minutes walk) and healthy options. The coffee is well made every time and options for food are plentiful. Free water available and they have a long table where it is nice to sit on
2
Visited here with friends and family. Pacamara is in the upper class Thomson area of Singapore. There was a wait which is a general organized chaos. When we had our order taken I had to ask for milk for the coffee and then I had to get up and get a spoon. When I asked for the sugar I was told "over there" and the guy pointed and I had to get it myself. The food is ok but the service needs to be bettered....otherwise the queues will be fading away
4
Been here few times and tried different menus. We dont eat pork but basically we tried almost all their non pork meal and loved all of them.Their salad is good but I asked the dressing on the side because it took away the freshness of the ingredients which I think is a waste.The only downside of this place is the long time they took to prepare the meal and when you are a family of 5 like us, then you wont eat together because the food comes one at a time...But still a good place for a meal when you not in a rush
4
I would say that this is one of the better places for good food and good coffee in that area. There is usually a larger crowd during late mornings right before lunch especially on weekends.We've been there several times and we found that the less busy the place is, the better the food tastes because there's more thought and attention given to the food. When they get busy then the quality of the food drops, the coffee tastes sour from over boiling and service sucks so to really enjoy the place, go when they are more accommodating

Popped into this corner cafe on a Sunday. It was heaving with bright young things and families with young children. We didn't try the food; only the coffee. Ordered a double expresso and an americano. The coffee was way to acidic for our liking (the same with Chye Seng Huat - that other wildly popular coffee place; not related to this one). Whether this is reflective of local coffee preferences, we're not sure. But it wasn't for us
4
We came across this area and couldn't resist the smell of the coffee brewing inside. We ordered 2 black coffee, which were very fresh and super good. We also ordered a breakfast platter and a salmon mentaiko. The breakfast so good and delicious. This restaurant also served toast with Allain Milliat raspberry jam. Super nice breakfast and coffee.
4
The brunch portions were very generous so thankfully the 2 of us ordered one Salmon Mentaiko Benedict to share, which was perfect. Coffees were perfect in acidity and the mocha was delicious.We had to share the long table for 6 with 3 other girls and the girls were talking so loudly it got quite unpleasant.Overall pleasant place to be in, we had a courteous staff around us to
5
Cool vibe, great menu, extensive coffee options for the seasoned or unseasoned coffee connoisseur. We'll be back next time we're in SG.
4
Nice spacious cafe with great quality food and good selection of both tea and coffee. Friendly staff and welcoming ambience. Price is slightly higher but definitely worth going again. Can be quite crowded on weekend so need to be patient in waiting for a table.
5
Pacamara is my favourite place in the whole of Singapore. I go there at least twice a month if not once a week to enjoy coffee and some food wth my friends. Literally everything I've had there has been fantastic I love it so much.
3
I was so familiar with the name of this place. In Thailand, there's a few branches. We stopped by for coffees after our late lunch several days ago. Coffees were good. But no skim milk. If the temperature of coffee could be hotter than the one we got, it would be nicer.
3
I have been to Pacamara a couple of times, but i do think the standards have dropped a little. Nonetheless a nice place for brunch with friends or family. Crab benedict is nice, sweet potato fries is nice as well.Their coffee beans might changed from the previous time so I'm not too sure why.. but staff was rude when questioned on the slight taste difference so no comments. I guess I'll skip coffee here next time unless I'm sure its the same one as the past
3
Other than the coffee & food, I believe the waitstaff plays an important role in shaping the experience in a cafe. When I first started going to Pacamara, it was great. No crowds, friendly staff. On the first visit, they even made a new cup of coffee for me when they served the order wrongly in a to-go cup. But lately, service has been more impersonal. Their coffee is still lovely but it's just not that enjoyable there anymore.
5
My friend found Pacamara from a suggested brunch list. We walked a short walk from Marymount MRT station to the cafe.It was very crowded on Sunday. We queued for around 20-30 minutes. There's an ipad by the door to sign up for a table before you queue.The place is neatly decorated in white. Was packed with youngsters and families. But the service was good and fast with big bonus smile.I ordered a Crab Benedict. It was like great work of art. Not only the great food display, but also the taste. The taste is balance the crab, the egg, and lil sweet bun with a touch of buttery taste. It was so delicious. I will return next time I'm in town to try other options and the coffee
4
Every time I stop in here I am not disappointed. The breakfasts are lovely, the coffee smells divine and the cafe itself has a great buzz and friendly feel. The menu is full of good choices for lunch and dinner and the place is always busy, especially on the weekends, showing just how popular it is with customers and is a great little cafe in the Upper Thomson Road area. Try it out, you'll enjoy it
4
Surprised by the food quality served, presentation of food was nice. Service could have been much better if the staff taking order knows whether replacement of food items is possible without having to consult kitchen each time. Would return to try the coffee and other item

Visited this café with my aunt on New Year's Day 2016, and was not disappointed! I had the Crab Benedict, which I thought was really tasty. There was a good amount of crab in the dish and the brioche bun definitely had standard. It wasn't as good (buttery + crisp) as some other cafés I've been to, but still quite decent! The poached eggs were executed well and I liked that the hollandaise sauce could be placed on the side. My aunt, on the other hand, had the Mushroom Benedict, which was also delicious! It came garnished with parmesan cheese, which was a nice touch with the mushrooms, as they complemented each other. We both ordered coffee after our meals and the in-house roasted coffee was quite something! The preparation of it was very professional and it was served in a cup that had been heated to ensure the coffee would still be warm when drunk. Taste wise, it was similar to an Americano, quite watered down and weak. I had the espresso but found it too sour for my liking. The service was great, the waiters/waitresses were friendly and efficient

We were here for brunch. Found their menu to have some great combinations of ingredients. The food was great in taste and quality. Their collection of Mikkeller beers is quite unique- try the coffee brunch beer.

Read about this place on blogs. Dropped in for a visit on a Sunday at about 350pm. Free seating but we saw most seats were taken. The staff helped up look for two seats. Got seated, ordered french toast ($16.90nett) and roadster coffee with milk 5oz ($5nett). We notice that the kitchen closes from 4-5pm so a note to those who would like some brunch, avoid coming here expecting food within that hr. French toastThick 2/3 inches of goodness that's crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The apple compote and vanilla compliments the french toast. I finished the whole thing, yearning for more.CoffeeNutty caramel notes, glides down with no trace of acidity, one of the best cuppa I have tried.I'm definitely coming back for more coffee and french toast

This place specializes in coffee. The place has hot and cold coffee. It has a variety of blends to choose. I like their coffee. Always order Iced Mocha. It has intended taste to it. Their hot coffee selection is good too and there is different sizes.The prices are competitive.Besides coffee, you can have other drinks, tea, food and desserts too. The place is not huge but it can hold a decent crowd, if you have a gathering, you should check out the place.The design is minimalist but yet comfortable!They sell coffee merchandizes too.It is by a road, so it can be reached easily by bus and car.The staffs are friendly and youthful too

Each time I pass this place its to get coffee to go. This time my wife and I decided to queue and try the food. It' was Saturday afternoon about 2.30pm and the space was packed. We waited about 20 mins , reviewing the interesting menus in the meantime. The decor is basic and simple. It's a great hang out for the young and not yet middle age crowd. Menu options are good and provide an adequate variety. The crab Benedict is superb! The Spanish egg is another tasty dish. The truffle fries and slightly better than those I have tried at other similar type places. The coffees are a must . Variety is great and whether you have it hot or iced, you won't be disappointed. My favorite was the Thai iced coffee. Pricing is mid range . Not a place if you want to have a good chat because of the noise, but if you have a mid to large group, it can be fun ( assuming you get a place) and noisy.Weekends are very crowded

It was little white-washed cafe, one of many shops nestled along the Upper Thomson neighbourhood stretch of road.On a weekday morning, at around 11am, it was rather empty. Sunlight was streaming through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows but it was a comfortable kind of brightness. The clean and minimalistic design was easy on the eyes.They had a brunch and dinner menu. In the middle of the cafe, there was a water dispenser for free flow of citrus-flavoured water. I ordered a Truffle Benedict ($18) with brioche, smoked ham, spinach, truffle hollandaise and free range poached eggs from the brunch menu.Despite looking divine, the taste itself was off-the-mark. For starters, what are poached eggs if their yolks weren't runny? Imagine my disappointment when I prodded the egg with my fork, and all I saw was a yellow lump of almost-solid yolk. The other egg at least, had a teeny bit of yolk oozing out, but still, it wasn't a good rendition of Eggs Benny.When they include "Truffle" in the name, I had expected more of the rich, earthy, unique taste of truffle. It was barely discernible.Thank goodness the brioche was decent and its crisp-edge-fluffy-inside combination cheered me up a little.However wonderful the smoked ham and spinach tasted, it could never quite erase my memory of the lacklustre poached eggs, if you could call it poached at all.Brunch wasn't as gratifying as expected, and nope, the price wasn't justifiable. As Pacamara is more well-known for their coffee and blends, I suppose I should brush that disappointing brunch off my mind and focus more on their coffee instead.A cuppa in hand and a laptop in front - Pacamara has the perfect ambience for you to do your work in peace.Post-brunch, I decided to stay on a little while more to get some work done, and ordered a $6 cup of Mocha. The latte art was... hmm. Nice try. I was hoping for something more instagram-worthy. At least the smooth mocha redeemed it.Their coffee would probably be worth a visit, but not the food.
4
Their coffee, food and service is the best and most consistent among other cafes along Upper Thomson Road.Though food is their after-thought, they serve really good dishes compared to their neighbours.They uses this special coffee and tea brewing machine to ensure that the filtered coffee and tea leaves are treated with respect according to their optimal water temperature!Keep up the good work! My hubby and I go there about once a week
4
Their food is indeed quite good, albeit on the expensive side (~$20 a dish) though there is no GST or service charge so it works out. Their sweet potato fries are not too bad for a cheaper lighter bites. For those getting pastas like the Mac and Cheese or the other creamy pastas, it is recommended that these dishes be shared as they can get a little gelat. Their soft shell crab burger is quite good too!Nice desserts too, though again on the expensive side. If you have to choose just one, go for the lemon yuzu tart.

We were recommended to this cafe by a friend . Having checked that this cafe closes at 2300hrs, we drove all the way from Pasir Ris to Thomson and arrived at 2200hrs for a drink only. To our disappointment, the cashier told us that they were closed for the day already be it we are ordering drinks only or not, let alone plain water!! The best joke is that there was still some crowd in the cafe and when I questioned the male cashier further on why their actual closing hours and publicized closing hours do not tally, he just "acted blur" and walked away..Verdict: i get the impression that they open and close as they please and opening hours are "for show" only! Don't bother to drop by
1
Very poor commitment level to neighbourhood customer. Arrived @ 2206hrs with a friend but was told that they were closed. The closing time was 2300hrs. This has occurred several times in 3 months. Would not recommend ppl to make a wasted trip if they need a caffeine fix before 2200hrs

Location - upper thompson, opposite the SHELL petrol station heading towards Sembawang. Parking will be a major pain in bottom :)Premise - nice white washed walls and simple decor that bangs on food and coffee more than the interior design of the space unlike other places. Played JAZZ music which made it 'warmer'Staff - friendly but lacking that emotion of pride working in such a cool place, my coffee was served with spillage. Smiles are lacking, making the service as cold as the white washed walls of the interior.Crowd - very good mix of singles, couples, families, tai-tai gatherings, friends, posers, working pple as well. :)Food - had the coffee that is somewhat not as exciting as the menu mentioned. Eggs Ben were very good but it's your atypical offering with little imagination.Verdict - will come again as the menu had some rather interesting offerings which ran out due to possibility of the long weekend here in SG
