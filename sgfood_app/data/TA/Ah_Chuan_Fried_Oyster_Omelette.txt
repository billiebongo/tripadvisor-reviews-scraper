Ordered the oyster egg 蚝蛋, and for $5, they gave generous portions of big oysters. The eggs were well fried and not too oily. If u intend to try other food, suggest u share this, otherwise u will feel really full after eating it.

Nice fragance of fried egg with pleasent aroma of fish sauce, for 5 dollars the oyster is around 4. The chilli is spicy and sour.

I have been to many stalls selling oyster omelette around Singapore. In my opinion, this is the best oyster omelette that I have had.The stall owner has been plying his trade for years and the experience shows in the final product – the oyster omelette that you eat!You can order:- Oyster Omelette: $4/ $5/ $8- Oyster and Prawn Omelette – I only knew they had this at my last visit. The oyster omelette is crispy and the oysters are well fried. Dipped in the chilli sauce, Unfortunately, the stall owner does not allow you to order more oysters in your dish, even if you are prepared to pay more. The only way is to order the larger portion and thus you get more oyster and omelette!The stall only opens from 2pm on weekends and 3pm on weekdays. They usually sell out by about 7pm. Go early to avoid disappointment!Although I loved this dish very much, I always have a word of caution to myself: Eat in moderation!Highly-Recommended
