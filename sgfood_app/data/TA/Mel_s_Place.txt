Terrible food, I had an australian steak and it was rotten. Then I ordered the cordon bleu it was awful so I did not even eat half of it. Avoid this place, even the beer was bad.

It's a very nice location with a good choice of drinks. You can also play pool or darts. However, service is not good and has a lot room for improvement. When it gets crowded they seem to be understaffed...

Unfortunately nothing good about them.
Highly overrated place in East Coast!
Bad service, rude servers/waiters. Their food options and preparation is so so.
Absolutely ignorant staff, most part you will be on your for most part.

Went there with 4 other girlfriends, 2 of them had pork chops which they said was yummy, I had lamb chops, which was very good too. The lamb chops were so well-done that the fat trimmings were so tasty and melted in the mouth. However, 1 of them had the pork ribs which was overcooked that it become dry and hard to che

Great pub, nice open area and the service was pretty good to. The beer was very expensive though. We ordered some bar snacks and they were of a high standard. We spent over 5 hours in there drinking so the place certainly had something to offer and keep us there

The Bar is well stocked and has outdoor seating too. Finger food to go along with some main courses. If you want to unwind and enjoy some good drinks and small eats, with friends and family, this place is good to sit out and have fun, The service is slow and I found they had less staff to cater to a large outdoor area. However, the bar tender was friendly and was able to recommend a host of drinks which he could make. Overall a nice place to hang out

This is nice, welcoming, friendly and very average pub. They play sport on average sized screens, they serve a typical selection of beers and offer your average pub fare in their menu. The friendly clientele is your average mix of after work happy hour locals, heavy drinking single expats, and couples minding their own business, all enjoying a happy go lucky, simple night out. The kind, smiling staff bring beer quickly, they keep an eye out for the next round and have never screwed up my bill. They're nice, friendly and workman like.Personally, I just go down for the pub garden, its rickety old furniture and the noise of East Coast road fighting with the 70's soft rock playing over the radio, all of which should let it down, but really, who cares? I'm here for a pint, maybe a burger, a chat with friends, a couple of laughs.If you want one-off cocktails and stylish decor, high end food and a clever playlist, go into town. Mel's is perfectly average, that is it's charm, and that's why I'll keep stopping by.

Mel's Place is ripping people off. I went there with friends on the Sunday evening to watch the F1 and should have seen the red flags when we ordered pasta and received a chicken schnitzel instead (second time this mistake has happened according to my friend who has been there before).The bar has a 1-4-1 drinks promotion all evening on Sunday. Drinks are stupidly expensive anyway for the East Coast - $15 for Guinness/Kilkenny/Kirin etc - but seemed reasonable if they were 1-4-1.Unfortunately when the bill arrived (photo attached) the prices of the drinks had magically risen to $22 a pint! Upon questioning the bar staff I was told that this was correct and that they do raise the price to $22 a pint when doing the 1-4-1 promo. When I complained about this the waiter snapped at me "I've worked in two bars in Singapore and this is the normal way!"Well, I've drank in hundreds of bars in Singapore and this is the first time I have seen such antics. $22 would get you two pints of Guinness/Kilkenny/Kirin in some bars, but to claim this is 1-4-1 deal when a normal drink price is $15 is shocking and insulting to their customers. If the price is increased then this is NOT 1-4-1.Thankfully there are plenty of bars on the East Coast so I'll be taking my business to one of those rather than return to Mel's Place to be scammed and given attitude

Mels place is an awesome place from you can wine and dine or even hang out and drink some beer with your friends or love ones. Mels place has awesome outdoor and indoor atmosphere. Eddie, Rowell and Richard is awesome and very passionate in the F&B industry.

I've been here once for dinner with some friends after a working dat, they know the owner pretty well. Good food, try the burgers! Wine selection is good as well as the spirits one. Relaxing place, unfortunately due to the rainy day we were not able to enjoy outside. Need to go back!

Very good and friendly sports pub with early happy hour 2 4 1 and served food. Recommend for a good night out.
5
Chilled out with business partners after work. 2-1 happy hour and good bar snacks & food. Recommend to anyone.
3
Good ambiance and neighborhood.
Have outdoor area as well.
One more place in SG for after office hours gathering.

Book through Chope and when I arrive at the restaurant, to my horror, the reservation wasn't register with the restaurant. Luckily for me, there and table available and we settle down for a nice evening.

Great places for drinks and food. There are darts, pool and live band for the masses. Huge buildup space in and out of the restaurant. Friendly and attentive staff that help out on your orders.
Overall a nice place to hangout in the east.

Mel's shouldn't be as good as it is! The decor is cheesy (but comfortable), it's alongside a main road (but not noisy) and the food is cheap (but good!). Great place to come for a Friday night beer or a Sunday night dinner with mates. Staff are attentive and genuinely friendly, plenty of deals on booze, food is good (although not a lot of choice for vegetarians - pizza, one pasta dish, fries)and there's sport on the tv's but it doesn't revolve around it so you can easily ignore it should you choose. Great spot

Stumbled across this place out looking for a late afternoon drink and what a find. Service great and made to feel very welcome. Good choice of draught beers and house spirits included in happy hour and a food menu with some good choices. Please do stop by and do enjoy the ambiance, which feels nothing like being by a busy road. Recommen

Great happy hour promotions with friendly service from the staff. I really like the vibe here. With delicious food like the lamb shank and the pies, I'm definitely going to return again. :) Take a taxi here if you're not familiar with the location but it's a walking distance from East Coast road.

I frequently visit this establishment usually in a group of 5-10 people. The staff are very helpful and prompt with your requests. The outdoor seating area is huge with a huge blower/fan that helps to reduce the outdoor heat. The beer is always served cold, the food is warm and delicious. Despite it being always crowded, I always manage to get a seat here. Would recommend this place for group outings

Cozy ambience and the staff are friendly and attentive. I did a facebook checkin mentioning it was a birthday celebration for my daughter and they gave her a surprise by having the band point her out, singing a birthday song and of course presenting her with a birthday cake. A very kind and sweet gesture which made my daughter very happy. She was smiling from ear to ear through out the evening. She was the centre of attention.

Food was delicious, staff were very attentive. Overall enjoyable night. A very good place for casual dining and my family and I will visit it again soon.

I am convinced the 5 star ratings can only be connected to the restaurant.
Poor service. Poor food ..
Will not be back

Great place! Fabulous outside seating. Nothing like it around this area! Great two for ones deals. Good food! One of our favorite spots to go on the east side of Singapore.

I had dinner here with friends. It has a good set up with indoor and outdoor seating. You can play pool, darts, watch a game or just enjoy a meal or a drink. On the Saturday night we attended there was a live band.On the positive side the meals we had were all very good.Drinks were well priced and they had a 2 for 1 offer for a few hours.Issue was really poor service. They just did not have enough staff.And menu selection. Of the 4 deserts they offered only 2 were available. It was a similar story for the main meal selection.A nice place for a relaxing drink just keep your expectations low

We went to this place coz my hubby couldn't eat his dinner at Margarita's (restaurant nearby). He ordered BBQ ribs which came with potatoes wedges and a few lettuces. It was good.We also ordered 1 sauvignon Blanc and 1 draft archi pelago which were good. After heavy, weather cooling down quite a bit. It was nice to sit at an outdoor area. The service was decent. The price was fair. Free WiFi here which very fast to upload a few pictures.

We had to order 2 meals (2 adult meals for our 9 and 12 year old boys!!!) as the portions were tiny! Quality ok but just not enough. Went for the Sunday brunch which essentially just means u can order breakfast until 3pm. Bouncy castle good for kids. Nice shady airy venue.

Waited close to an hour for my pork rack, which was asked 3 times during the span of one hour, "pork rack?""Pork ribs?""Pork rack?" Dear Lord, have mercy. I'm very hungry. I thought. Everyone at the table literally took turn to eat. The last time we did this, we were digging trenches in the army some 20 years ago. Sure brought back good old memories. Could be better if I was not made to pay for the food. Thankfully, the food was good. So good, I was worried if the cook actually something special to my food because I've asked too many times for my order and finally pulled a black face. Otherwise, the place is a sensation filled with history. You get to choose to dine in alfresco or head to the bar inside.Park is scarce, though they have a third party valet service next door at $7, but u get to redeem $5 from your total bill of minimum $50 spent, if I remember correctly. Will definitely revisit if I'm in the area. But I won't drive up purposely for it though.

I called ahead to find out what time last orders were for meals, and was told 10.30. Arrived at the bar at 10:15 and ordered our dinner.Ordered two starters, and only one arrived because the waitress thought we were sharing the starter. A little disappointed. Maybe it was Wagyu beef for my main course, but it didn't really impressed me. At 10:45 the waitress asked if you could serve our desert. Chocolate Lava cake and ice cream. We were halfway through the main course but apparently the chef wanted to close the kitchen. Needless to say, the ice cream was melted by the time we went to eat it.This facility is certainly not customer service orientated for sure.The ambiences is very pleasant, and the beer is very good. I love to sit outside and have a beer, but I'll be skipping the food next time

For some reasons, it's doesn't matter what cocktails I ordered. Its always turn bad and sent it back many time. I kinda love sitting out and wanna enjoy cold drinks.But I can't do it here. The foods was OK. The Drinks you better off order wine or beers. I tried a few times never success. My friends live around this area, it made me had to went back. If you're curious why if it bad and I kept going back
3
 Fairly none descript to be honest. It's was ok. It's an outside sports bar. The service was ok, menu choice ok, the ambience was probably its best attribute. If you are in the area and fancy a nibble and a beer pop in, but don't go out of your way
3
Ambience was great with occasionally live band,
Service,food selection and drinks on menu were moderate
We don't find happy hours very appealing which is till 8.
4
Relaxing atmosphere, cozy. Good drinks and food. Nice terrace with loads of palm trees. Be sure to arrive before 8pm to enjoy happy hour. If you enter before 8pm you can order multiple sets which the serve not all at once. Use it wisely :)

I stopped there as the place seemed nice. It's a relaxing garden. But when it comes to found there are much better choice on the same street. A nice place for a beer.
3
Relaxed atmosphere, tasty food, but some portions a bit small. Good live music and decent beer prices, for Singapore.

Quite a good place in the East Coast part of Tampines for drinks, bar snacks and watching sports on TV.

The restaurant has undergone renovations on the main building, with a new look on the inside, which is air conditioned. The band which used to play outside now plays inside. You can also sit outside the restaurant to enjoy your food and drinks alfresco.The restaurant now has a good selection of small plates for people to enjoy with their drinks. They have included Japanese cuisine into their menu.Here are the highlights of our meal:Starter-Drambuie Smoked Salmon: $16. Restaurant smoked their own salmon and its served with yuzu goma sauce, Crème Fraiche, dried blueberries. You can try the salmon on its own and its not salty. Eaten with the yuzu goma sauce, its nice and adding the Crème Fraiche gave it added dimension.Nice! Small Plates- Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly: $10. My friend went crazy over this. He’s a meat lover and he went for it straightaway. The pork is nicely stewed and the tempura purple sweet potato is a nice complement.- Grilled Japanese Squid: $18. Whole Japanese Squid charcoal grilled with salt and pepper. No sauce was given. Just squeeze lemon over it and its divine. Must order!- Tempura prawns and vegetables: $12. The prawns were big in size. The batter is light and I enjoyed this very much. Its great value and highly recommended. I even ate the prawn head which was crunchy and nice. Main Course- Amazing Version Beef Cheek: $30. This was 12 hours slow cooked grass fed beef cheek with mash potato and crispy croissant. Excellent presentation, that is totally unexpected. It’s served on a platter in Chinese utensils, and made to look like a Chinese meal with rice and double boiled soup. Instead the rice bowl contained the mashed potato which was good and you open the soup container to reveal the beef cheek stew! You either use your chopsticks or spoon to scoop the contents out to eat. If you love beef, you MUST ORDER this!- Miso Lychee Pork Belly: $24. This was another WOW dish. Its presented on a long plate, with a glass of lychee compote (which resembled fried pork lard, and I really thought it was pork lard!), 2 pieces of grilled pork belly, plain Chinese bun, rocket salad and candied hazelnut. You put the items together in between the Chinese bun and eat it. I ate it all, including the fats and skin of the pork belly. Recommended! Sashimi- Fresh Sashimi: $80. 5 types of sashimi: Sword fish, Salmon, Tuna, Amberjack and Scallops with a generous scoop of roe. The fish are thickly cut and totally worth the money spent. Good! Dessert:- Melting Lava Cake: $12. Served with vanilla ice cream. We had to eat this quickly, as the ice cream was melting and the lava cake was best eaten warm. Eating the cake with the ice cream was yummy!- Hamburger Macaroon: $10. Nutty chocolate parfait, strawberry and blueberry compote and topped with icing sugar. Nice presernation. The lades will love this. Must try!I am very impressed with their new menu, which has a good variety and the quality is good. They are generous with their servings.Recommended

As above but in addition mozzies everywhere outside, staff could not understand English and then tried to rip us off, happy hour there was nothing happy about the happy hour, the music was very depressing all in all not a good place don't go there unless you want ripped off, prior to this we were in a place called mad nest the owner a Chinese Singaporean was so friendly so go there instea

This place is near my home, it's great for a cold beer, a chat or a chill out listening to some music. The food is pretty good especially the prawn cocktail and the kurubuta pork chop. Most of the guys serving are really cool and give great service. If you're in the area its worth a look especially in the evenings, they have nice fans blowing to keep you cool even outside.

Keeping this brief - We visited Mel's for brunch and were greeted warmly by the staff, which was followed by good service. However the quality and serving of the food leaves it far from satisfactory. Honestly for the money we paid, we could have had much much better quality of food and accompaniments. After reading through its reviews, we feel maybe it was one of the bad days to visit this place.

We have escaped the winter weather of the UK for a week in Singapore. We really enjoyed the contrast of sitting outside in the warmth of a Saturday evening in February in Singapore - and the food and service was very good. It was not cheap, but it was good value for money. In addition, there was live music
