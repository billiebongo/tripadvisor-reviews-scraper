When you are in Singapore, you must go to Ponggol Nasi lemak, location in tg. Katong ipen from 05.30 pm to 02.30 am you must hurry and queuing, the rice and all food menu is very delicious.

Before they commercialised the Nasi Lemak and became like fast food, they were cheap and good when they only had one shop at Upper Serangoon, now they are so expensive, and the portions are so small. Got a shock when my bill came to $20 for two person, for ordering the same thing and more at Upper Serangoon the bill would have come to about $10. Never gonna eat at this shop anymore just too touristy

Went to the branch at Kovan and there's a very Long queue ahead of me. From my observation, I knew I had to have my orders ready in my head (was buying for 4 pax) else the staff will drown and glare at me for taking too long to recite the orders. Food is very very overpriced. Tastes good but still wouldn't justify the price and queue experience.

Went there for late lunch on a weekday. No queue at the Jalan Besar Branch. Food is clean but portion is a little small. Set meal $4-5. Best of all the place is air con. There is limited car park at the open car park area. Service is fast.

I like the food but not the price or the queue. At dinner time, expect to queue for at least 15 minutes and be forced to rattle off your order as quick as you can. Very stressful especially if you are ordering for a few people

I have been here twice. You order at the counter. There are several set meals which are good values ($4-5). You can also order only the things you like or as a shared serving. Individual servings are around $1-2 each.The coconut milk rice was not too rich; enough flavour and not too bad on the heart.Service was fast. The place is air-conditioned and clean.The only thing was the staff were all from China so lacking a bit in authenticity
