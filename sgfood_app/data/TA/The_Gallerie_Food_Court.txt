A place where you can find healthy food. Fresh fruit and vegetables dishes. It can be a little bit to warm because it is an open space. But if you sit near the streets it is nice

Good selection of venues available and reasonable prices. Good location, direct link from Marina Mandarin Hotel and close to the harbor front and all the attractions

The place looks like it is very popular among locals. The food is very tasty and the prices are very good.

The breakfast buffet was excellent and enabled us to sample a wide range of cousins. Steff were friendly and helpful.

so much choice. All are clean, good value, nice and cool after being outside in the heat, and most importantly - tasty! I wish I could go back now!

Variety of food was excellent. Went a few times and had different meals. Even thinking of the food now that i am home. Wish I was back there.

It's never easy to find food courts in Singapore which aren't too busy at lunchtime. This one doesn't seem to get too packed. I visited for lunch this week with a colleague and opted for the wonton noodles. Having devoured a bowl of noodles I was still hungry so supplemented with some dim sum - which was ok but not special. Getting a table was easy enough at around 12.30
