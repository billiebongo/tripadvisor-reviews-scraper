Yes, it's a F&B outlet at a tourist attraction, but I was pleasantly surprised! Definitely a decent choice for local food in the bird park - and I'm a local. The orange ciabatta was not too bad at all too!

We ordered hainanese chicken rice and nasi lemak mama. Decent taste,but it stil okay. Still recommended.

It's a very good place to eat in Jurong Bird Park. There are multiple dining options. Being Vegetarians we got Veg Biryani for SGD 8 , which was good. There were other options as well.

We arrived at the Bird Park a little hungry and so decided to have Kaya Toast and Kopi before going inside.
The service was friendly, the surroundings clean and comfortable, and we enjoyed our reasonably priced breakfast.

Situated near the Hawk Arena is the Hawk Café, which offers a small selection of meals, local as well as Western: toast with eggs, chicken chop with fries, fish and chips, Nasi Lemak, Hainanese chicken rice, various soft drinks (including iced teas, juices, and juice-based drinks) and so on. If you’re already inside the Jurong Bird Park limits (and you want o come back in after your meal at the Hawk Café) you’ll need to let a staff member know so that they can place a special stamp on your arm or hand to indicate that you’ve got a valid ticket to re-enter the park.This is a very pleasant little café, with somewhat middle eastern looking décor and nice big windows looking out onto the surroundings. We ordered a Hainanese chicken rice set, a fish and chips, and a tropical fruit cup, for a total of about S$30, inclusive of taxes. The Hainanese chicken rice set consisted of a very tasty rice; the accompanying broth (good and hot, especially welcome on the very rainy day on which we visited); the sliced chicken; some baby bok choy, cooked lightly with browned garlic; and a little dipping sauce which looked red and fiery but tasted pretty mild, sweetish-sour rather than hot. The fish and chips consisted of two substantial fillets of batter fried fish, very fresh and good; chips; tartare sauce; a generous helping of coleslaw, and a wedge of lemon. The tropical cup was a large portion of thickly chopped honeydew, rock melon and watermelon: good and very well chilled. Portion sizes were pretty substantial, and more than enough for two adults and one four-year old who doesn’t eat much

We weren't expecting much when we decided to have a meal here, we were just wanting something hot after tramping around the bird park in the pouring rain for several hours. Were pleasantly surprised though, the food was quite nice. I had the Laksa, which was good, the spice was toned down but otherwise was very flavorsome. Husband had the chicken rice which he said was tasty. Price was reasonable given the location at the park, more so than the western food options

Astonishingly poor quality of food and service at one of the leading tourist attractions in Singapore. Puzzlement came to mind on how this café is able to survive till now. We ordered the Nasi Lemak, supposedly the favourite at the café. However, the food was bland and cold. The café had done no justice to one of the local favourite dishes, giving the wrong impression to the tourists. The service was non-existent from cleaners/ servers to the “chef”. Being rude seems to be the value inculcated into the staff. Throwing the dishes at the counter by the “chef” and rude cleaning staff whose main objectives were to clear paying customers out of the way, were just some of the unfortunate incidents. 2 stars were awarded for the air-conditioned environment and proximity to the exit

The place was clean and air conditioning was powerful. We only tried Chicken rice set. It's came with full bowl of aroma rice, plate of boiled chicken, boiled kale and soup. The cost was 9.80S$. It was higher than you will normally pay in food court. But the portion here is much bigger than hawker place outside. For the portion you get this is not the bad value at all. It's outside the park but you can ask gate staff to stamp your wrist for in and out.
