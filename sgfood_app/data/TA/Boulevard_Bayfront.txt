Ok bar bar in the Financial district. Had drinks there on a Wednesday and we enjoyed it. Service was al right, nothing to be proud of by some smiles. The fares were aligned with the other establishment in the area.

Singapore is an expensive destination for sure and you hardly find cheap restaurants.
We were here for snacks and drinks mostly, price average and service satisfactory.
Not thrilled though!

Great just to get a bit of he atmosphere of Singapore and see the shops and restuarants.
Not a must see but you will come across it by accident when your are down the bay front

Hot spicy noodles are so tasty and the sweets can beat the conditoreis in paris.
The place is a recommendable place to chill and enjoy the bayview.

Foods were good while the price is acceptable with the location. Nice views, service was not ok but somehow acceptable, probably culture and busy hours.

The place serves the financial crowd from MBFC... Food and drinks are a little on the upper end.....but they can afford...

Met friends for drinks pre going for pit lane experience at F1. Drinks fine. Atmosphere good especially for people watching. Central location.

What you pay (pretty dearly) for here are the view and the convenient location (for MBFC/ORQ workers), because the mainly bar-food is nothing to write home about, service is erratic, and the facilities are barebone/basic.

Lunch set gives good value for money. Their malayan seafood noodles is actually quite tasty. Service can be improved. We made reservations for 3 people in advance and yet they made us sit on a bar table fit for two (when there are customers who clearly had more space than required eg two pax sitting in a table of four).

Indeed - this bar specialises in hiring the prettiest waitress across its competition. Other then that they have a good lunch menu along with all kinds of liquor that you want. The manager is friendly and does his best to accommodate. Very nice bar to go on Wednesday Friday specially. Every other day is fine too.
