This place is good to have India food. We have visited this place almost more than 10 times. Quality of food is really good.

We wanted a change from hawker food dining so set off to Little India to check out the restaurants. The cost of a meal here is still double the price of hawker food, but was the best value of all the places we looked at on Racecourse Road.There is a good varied menu with plenty of vegetarian options (we are not vegetarian) along with meat dishes and some international food. The place was very clean and bright, with good service and tasty food. The portions appear quite small at first glance, but the dishes are deceptive and are quite deep, resulting in our hunger being well satisfied. The only disappointment was the size of the naans, but then this seems normal in Singapore, where naans are not the size of those we are used to in the UK.We tried to visit again about a week later but there was no room, as it is quite small and didn't really want to sit outside by the road

We had lunch at this new fusion place ( Opened in Oct 2017)The curry chicken was tasty and packs a punch.The naan ( flat bread ) was warm and freshly made.Complimentary crispy snacks and water were given when we sat down.The menu comprises proper Indian food as well as some pizzas , burgers , Middle Eastern platter , wraps and various Indian snacks and desserts .Ambience cozy and clean , a nice place to meet friends and chat over chai!The toilet is surprisingly clean ! Most restaurants in Little India cannot measure up to that standard of cleanliness !Waitress was friendly , helpful and chatty.They offer take -away as well.For our next visit , we shall try other dishes on the menu .Will need a few more visits to try all the dishes

We ordered a butter Paneer, Fish Curry, Romali Roti and Chappati to go, which we later decided to eat in. They were very quick to accomodate with a table with cultery and drinks. The portion were small, suitable of eating alone, hence we added a paneer pizza. Good place for a quick meal
