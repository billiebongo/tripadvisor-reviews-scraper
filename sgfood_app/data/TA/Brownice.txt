My first experience of Vegan ice cream at this place recently. The dark chocolate was quite tasty. Seems like a reasonably popular place, but not that cheap at around $7 for 2 scoops.

Their food is healthy, look appetizing. My favourite is their black sesame ice cream, green tea ice cream, and coconut ice cream. Oh ya, and also hedgehog pizza, the best pizza in town.

Matcha Ice Cream wasn't the best one I ever have in Singapore.
It was melted little too fast. The aroma and taste of Green tea could be stronger.. Overall it was just OK.
The sugar cone was nice and crispy. Like this the most

I went to brownice maybe 2 years ago before I went vegan and enjoyed the ice-cream but thought that it tasted quite strongly of rice milk. Now that I am vegan I absolutely love their ice cream! I would also highly recommend their waffles and brownies which are out of this world

Definitely the best vegan pizza I've ever had! We ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza & the Truffle Porchini Funghi pizza. We also had the frozen chocolate shake and Nutella ice-cream with waffle for dessert. Pizzas: Incredible. The cheese was so good, I had to ask if it was vegan or dairy (non-dairy of course). BBQ has such real tasting chicken, I was really pleasantly surprised, . Truffle pizza had a cheesy, garlicky taste which I loved, but could have had a little more actual mushrooms on top (please). Hot and came fast! (10-15 mins for a fresh pizza is quick- with the restaurant about half-full)Chocolate shake:We had 1 to share and thank goodness as its so rich and thick but SO delicious!! Don't ever change the recipe for that! Dessert:The ice cream was tasty and definitely I couldn't tell it was vegan (soy-free as well). The waffle to be honest was a bit dry and not warm... It wasn't bad but I wish I'd gone for the brownie instead. Some more cake choices would be great. Location:So inconvenient for us (staying in Bugis). We had to take a bus for around 30 mins to get there and back as there was no MRT. The area looks ok though, a couple of bars next door, but Bugis/central would be a far better location. (A branch in the airport would also be beyond incredible for us as we transfer at Singapore very often- wishful thinking on our side). Value: Quite good value for what it is (vegan cheese is not easy to come by, neither is vegan Italian). They had some lunch offers that looked quite good but we couldn't afford to come here for dinner every day sadly. It cost us $51 SGD for what we ordered. Thankful they gave free filtered water at least. Great service! No complaints apart from location. Expect me back soon!!!

I was googling around for yogurt suitable for the lactose intolerant and came across Brownice mentioned for their brown rice milk ice cream.We ordered a Spicy Chick thin crust pizza at around 6:30pm on a Sunday. There was only one other couple around who ordered waffles and ice cream. The vegan pizza was creamy and flavourful even with soy 'ham' and 'chicken'.We then ordered a waffle with matcha and dark chocolate ice cream. Ice cream is creamy and heavy bodied. Pretty good. Would come back again to try their shakes because yay, no more pain for consuming creamy food

We stopped there for some ice cream in the middle of a walk. Ordered one scoop of Pink 'n' Yellow and one scoop of PB 'n' Choc. Being a vegan myself, I was quite excited to taste it however it didn't live up to expectations. I tried the PB 'n' Choc one first. A bit bland but still edible. After finishing the PB 'n' Choc I tried the Pink 'n' Yellow icecream. I had to stop eating after I found at least 5 bits of hair(not the colour of my my hair, so not my hair) in the Pink 'n' Yellow ice cream. Was disgusted

Brownice Ice Cream is the first dessert place in Singapore to serve low-calorie, low-GI, low-fat, vegan-friendly and dairy-free ice cream made from organic brown rice. Guilt-free ice cream at it's best. Even though it's dairy-free, you should note that the ice cream does not taste icy at all, though it also lacks the creamy taste, Brownice ice cream still holds the smooth textures.The 4 scoops of ice cream we picked were :CoconutHazelnutMatchaPeanut ButterIt might sound like alot of flavours, but they all went well together. First off, if this is your first visit to Brownice, definitely go for the coconut! There's real coconut fruit embedded in the ice cream! It is slightly creamy, with authentic coconut taste and sweetness. It goes really well with the chocolate syrup topping.The matcha wasn't too bitter, and the sweetness level was just right for me. I don't like matcha ice creams that taste too sweet or artificial. Over here, the matcha was closer to the grainy texture, as unlike the coconut, the matcha wasn't able to have a smooth aftertaste. Nevertheless, probably the best guilt-free and vegan matcha you can taste in Singapore! The peanut butter was too sweet for my liking, but you could taste real peanut butter embedded into the ice cream. Think of chunky monkey from ben and jerrys. Lots of peanuts too, that adds a crunchy bite in every scoop!The hazelnut was almost like eating nutella ice cream! It was a tad sweet, and I probably wouldn't finish a whole scoop by myself, but give me a scoop of coconut or matcha, and it will magically disappear with a spoon in my hand.The waffle here is of a crispy consistency. I would say, this is one of my most favourite waffle places in Singapore. Despite the waffle not having any fragrance or aroma. The light, airy and yet biscuit like edges makes this waffle so addictive.Overall :  A great place to get vegan ice cream, even if you're not a vegan, or trying to stay on a healthy diet. The ice creams here are great, and so are their waffles. There's free wifi too! Definitely download the Entertainer App before heading down to Brownice

Anyone writing a review of any reasonable substance proclaiming this to be a restaurant of quality and integrity obviously has a commercial interest in the establishment.Our night started with a reasonable expectation based on previous reviews and quickly went down an irreversible slippery slope. The food was less than impressive however it was the time taken to deliver it. 1 hr from initial order - for the first dish! Then another 45 minutes for the final. We had to self collect from the kitchen as the teenage waitress was busy treating her friends to an ice-cream tasting buffet. The 3 tables of customers were virtually ignored.After the cook (there was 1 only) rang the bell repeatedly we were forced to collect our plates - on no less than 3 occasions. The food was uninspiring however for the sake of congeniality I'll leave it at that. How does it take 1.45mins to serve 3 tables even with 1 cook, total of 9 customers. Shambles. Do yourself a favor and those of us who had to fork out good money and close your doors. You are clearly not interested in creating any legacy of any note.Goodnight and goodbye!Pros: East Coast Road, None, NoneCons: Time it takes to deliver a meal, 'Self-Service' - go to the Kitchen and self collec, Wait Staff - you'll be waiting foreve

We spotted this place just when we were strolling in the evening and trust me the place is for all vegetarians. The order was freshly made especially the pizza and the variety they offer is a must to go for. The place also serves ice-creams and one cannot leave without grabbing them especially the mint-mia was the one I grabbed and yes it was delicious ! Overall a good place to try for something different in vegetarian pizzas and pastas

Wonderful ice-cream, pizzas and coffee. On way to zoo / safaris, so can be good place to get vegan meal with fair trade coffee.

Like the fresh flavours and fresh ingrediants they use from the starter to the main and also with the desserts. They have vegan icecream based on ricemilk.

Very out of the way. 10-15 walk from Marymount mrt. Not only that, prices are comparable to starbucks.
However, this is the place to visit if you want 100% vegan food. Free wifi is provided, but overall the experience is disappointing

Brownice is a cute cafe that serves different flavours of vegan ice-cream. I was very excited to get Vanilla and peanut butter, flavours that normal ice cream comes in! I liked the peanut butter more than vanilla but was still slightly put of by an aftertaste i cannot explain. I would definitely say to try Brownice ice cream and see if you like it or not, its a personal opinion

I am accustomed to vegan food, not crazy about it but my husband on the hand utterly detests it. We decided we would cut out meat for a while & happened upon this restaurant. The pizza was even better than a traditional pizza (we had the four Seasons) & then ice cream after, the ice cream was so good, I decided to get a pint to take home. The staff were also super friendly. We can't wait to go back. Keep it up

Unprofessional environment, the owner was there when we visited and he did not even say hello, goodbye or anything else. We ended up in the middle of the staff receiving and installing new equipment and shuffling things around, this should be done outside of opening hours. The vacuuming robot was even turned on while we were there! The owner does not have any business sense.Good and friendly ice cream service.The ice creams are too sweet and not cold enough, they rapidly melt down even when staying inside the shop.Overall the price is high for the experience

My girlfriend and I love the pizza, especially love the Tofu crumble and the Ice cream here. We visited a couple of times after reading reviews praising the place for it's great vegan food and we make it a point to visit whenever we find ourselves in the vicinity. While it definitely does not fall under the cheap range, the quality of the food more than makes up for it. Two Thumbs up

Brownice sells vegan ice cream made from organic brown rice milk instead of dairy, with no animal ingredients nor artificial ingredients, healthy yet still a delicious, creamy treat. My favourite flavours are their Madagascan vanilla, French chocolate, durian, strawberry, and the coconut flavour which is sublime! Rich and smooth, it's made with fresh coconut milk and coconut flesh. I also adore their waffles with ice cream! And the new, pretty cheesecakes are a delectable vegan version, they have that cheesecake texture and taste.Now they even offer a small range of crispy-crust vegan pizzas! The Tofu Crumble pizza is popular with my family, it's just amazing how they made the tofu crumble taste so good, and the pizza is very generously covered with toppings and cheese sauce, and at the end of the slice you crunch into the crispy crust... yumm! There are also other innovative flavours like Otak Otak, which I've tried and like, Fish Curry and English Breakfast, which I'm planning to try but haven't yet because I always end up ordering Tofu Crumble!I've patronised Brownice on and off for quite a while now. The owner is the sweetest lady who always has a bright smile for everyone, and whose love for Brownice shows in the consistent high quality of the products, the effort put into plating, the way she happily answers any questions in detail, and the sincere service and care she extends to her customers.I'm vegan and happy that I can order anything since everything they serve is vegan, though non-vegans such as my meat- and dairy-loving family like their food just as much! A pleasant shop at a quiet location with friendly, helpful staff, I enjoy going there for pizza followed by dessert and coffee, or just dropping by for their lovely desserts

My hubby and I absolutely love this place. Since we're in the process of going vegan, giving up ice cream and sweet treats is proving rather difficult. Thankfully we found Brownice!The pizzas are simply amazing. The Otahk-otahk and English Breakfast taste decadent with a good variety and amount of toppings on a crisp base. I can't wait to try the rest of the flavours!The ice creams and sweets are so yummy! I really love that there is a huge variety of flavours to choose from- I've not been disappointed yet.:) my favorite has to be the affogato- fragrant espresso with a scoop of yummy vanilla ice cream. My hubby decided to be extra adventurous and have it with the peanut butter caramel ice cream! And he loved it! The owner and staff are so friendly and helpful. I love this place! I've been telling all my friends about it. :

My boyfriend and I love Brownice! We came here the first time mid August during our holiday in Singapore, searching for vegan eateries across the island. During our first visit we tried the mudpie and waffles with ice cream - incredible! We enjoyed it so much, 4 more visits followed. We then tried several other dishes including green tea cheesecake, ice cream with caramelised sea salt almonds - but what we loved most were the brownies: intensely chocolatey, chewy, served warm with chocolate ganache. We even ordered a box of 10 to bring back home after our holidays. Add a scoop of ice cream (or many more, if you wish) - heaven! Brownice has a huge variety of flavours from more classic flavours like french chocolate and hazelnut to more exotic ones such as coconut and peanut butter gula melaka with chocolate fudge sauce. There's something for everyone! They also serve vegan thin crust pizza. We tried the tofu crumble pizza, which was very tasty.Wether you're vegan, vegetarian, lactose-intolerant or a foodie - you'll love it!As I love ice cream so much, a vegan ice cream parlour was like a dream come true to me (not exaggerating, haha). And I've easily had some of the best vegan ice cream I've ever tasted here at Brownice
