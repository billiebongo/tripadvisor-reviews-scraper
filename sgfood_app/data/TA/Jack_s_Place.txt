Coveniently situated and not far from the Post Office, Raffles Hotel et al. Reasonable selection of dishes, and efficient service.

Good experience, the location is easy to find, the service is generally ok, not many people there so itâ€™s quite fast

Friendly waitresses n waiters. Clean and brighter environment compared to previously before renovation.

Comprehensive menu that fell short on quality. For the price, one expects some quality. Instead, steaks were tough, portions petite, service without any passion....

Went for the steaks and it's so affordable and good! Gonna be back again soon! Love the cosy and homely atmosphere too :)

Food was great as usual. But would appreciate if they had served the main course abit later, after we are dine with the starters.

We has a lunch here, two week ago, and enjoyed a very good fish and chips. Good service and tasty fish! This place is actually known for good steaks.

Chinese New year's eve lunch was at Jack's Place Parkway Parade. Clean restaurant with complimentary WiFi. A special set lunch menu replaced the existence. Lunch was at $19.90 ++ per person. Had clear chicken soup, ribeye steak as main course and mango pudding. Waited 15 minutes for the food. Average food at reasonable price. Restaurant was 70% occupied at 1.30pm.Enjoyed.

Severely disappointed as we visited for Xmas lunch. Service was terrible throughout and was rude when we asked for some changes to the menu due to allergies. Wait staff was under staffed and everyone was rushing everywhere frantically. We ordered the steak. The cut was poorly done, with lots of fat. Some played had more sauce then others even if it was the same order, no consistency overall. We use to come every Xmas for lunch but think this will be the last time, just very disappointing

We just moved to EastCoast and brought my Bf there for the first time to have lunch after our grocery. We ordered their recommended steak on a hot plate. It was so yummy including the potatoes w bacon and sour cream. If only the place has an outdoor, this will be perfect. Currently, the restaurant inside the mall and it can be a little bit cold inside due to AC. We will definitely go back there for another steak

old establishment for decent food. Outlet at Parkway has been revamped (including menu) and whilst nothing stands out from the revamped Jack's Place concept, they are still an old favourite with many older generation people
2
One steak of was under cooked. $35 each for a bowl of soup and a steak at such quality. Totally not worth. Similar to Aston quality at a much higher price.
5
The food and service level at jacks place has always been consistently good. Will go for jack places when I got craving for nice steak.
2
They were clearly understaffed. The food was decent and the 4 wait staff for a dinning room of 120 was clearly insufficient. The garlic bread was a laugh. Prob wont go back for dinner though their lunch set meal miggt be reasonable.
4
Great service. Servers were prompt in their service despite the crowd. When I requested for a quiet corner, the lady waitress gladly obliged.
5
The service is very Good and The food o so very nice my family members like To eat .... we very enjoy On the Day

Good place especially with kids - personal prioritize kids and are pretty much available for any requests - meals well served in time even with various dishes ordered.
Good wine selection too

This outlet has seen more frequent change of service staff in recent years. During the 90s, even the crowd size was tremendous, the team of staff kept doing a good job. With around the same or may be slightly less staff now, waiting for someone to come to your table to take order can be 10 to 15 minutes after waiting unnecessarily to get a table despite available tables around.Menu has little change but price is up. Drop of standard in service is very obvious even food keeps the same old style

Ordered 2 tea time sets, drink+ham and cheese sandwich @ $7.80++ and drink+chicken and mushroom spaghetti @ $11.80. Food was average but restaurant was generally quiet as after lunch crowd.However half-way through, a gentleman took the neighbouring table and kept clearing his throat.Service staff was polite, order was accurate
4
Had late lunch cum tea with my daughter at 2.30pm. The $7.80 student meal was tasty and came with a drink. We topped up $1.70 for a mushroom soup to complete the meal. I ordered a $11.80 tea time special, the chicken spaghetti was pretty decent. After utilising my membership $20 bday vouchers, just need to pay < $2. Great

To fans of Jack's Place, this is our go-to place for an affordable family meal. We have been coming here for over 20 years. Good food at affordable prices. That should say someting about this place.
4
Food is average. Not very good nor very bad. Good ambience for dinning and lunch meeting. Good variety of western food. Set lunch cost $15 onwards for main course, soup , dessert and drink.

Was shopping at Parkway Parade this afternoon. Decided to dine at Jack's Place located at level 1. Clean restaurant but too noisy for a good conversation during lunch hour.Ordered Grilled Barramudi with Green Vegetables for lunch. Not so fresh, little watery for grilled fish. Little disappointed with this dish.Will visit this restaurant again but never order this fish again. Not worth the $16.90++ paid

On 27 January 2017(Friday) visited Parkway Parade. Decided to have lunch at Jack's Place located at Level 1 (few steps from the mall Customers Service Counter).A special new year eve menu was offered at $15.90++ for grilled fish set lunch. Clear broth soup dipped with garlic bread was tasty. Grilled fish with seasonal vegetables and pasta was well done too. Mango custard was refreshing. Satisfied lunch worth the dollar spent.Enjoyed

Visited Jack Place (Parkway Parade) for dinner tonight. Restaurant located on Level 1 of the mall. Clean restaurant with 50% occuancy at 7.30pm. Friendly staff.Restaurant has a weekday (Momday - Friday / valid till 30 November) promotion.Mixed grill set comprises of chicken, mutton, beef, sausage on hot plate at $17.80++.Big portion. Little greasg still acceptably good dinner. Enjoyed

Visited Jack's Place for lunch. The restaurant offered an adhoc menu for that day.Chosen the salmon and spaghetti set. Simple lunch which is completely acceptable in the heartland mall. Tasty food at above average prices.Always enjoy the restaurant's value for money set lunch ranging from about $13.90 - $25.90 for (1) soup with garlic bread, (2) Choice of Main Course, (3) Dessert and (4) Choice of coffee or tea.Good place for family and friends gathering

Went back to Jack's place after a few yeara. The food was ok. We ordered caesar salad, mixed grill, spaghetti bolognaise, fish and chips. Would recommend the mixed grill. Felt the pricing was on the high side. There are other places offering just as good western meal at lower price

Entered the restaurant to discover we only had three options of Christmas Eve dinner to choose from.We ordered Set B and C, and each set cost $39.90++. Take a look at the pictures and assess yourself if it is worth it. I have however left out the dessert which was some chocolate cream thingy as something unfortunate happened which made me lost my interest in taking the picture.As for service, most of the staff were polite and courteous. We were unfortunately served by a waitress by the name of Alice who was pretty reluctant to do her work as she unwillingly served us the food. Would we return there in the near and distant future? No
2
Set lunches are of decent value offering a soup, main, dessert and coffee/tea for approx $20 afte Gst and surcharges.However, upon asking for a medium cooked steak, I received mine medium rare. Service is generally friendly but will be slow at peak hours.Better off at Astons if you want cheap steak or pay premium and go to a proper steakhouse

The usual place I come to when I have a craving for decent and reasonable priced steak. What I like about this place is the food ( of course) and the service ( very accommodating as I don't take broccoli and cauliflower , they changed it to garden salad for me )Today I ordered 3 dishes, lobster bisque, escargot and the NZ ribeye.Lobster Bisque- Taste is rich and potion is decent for $6. Surely no one is expecting real lobsters to be used for that price, probably the meat given is shellfish. (7/10)Escargot - Not for the weak heart! Presentation was awesome , looks yummy, they even lit up a fire in front of you.. Must be really good right? Wrong, the worst I have ever tasted. If they spent the amount of time preparing the dish rather than presenting it , the taste and texture would be better. Basic fundamentals of serving escargot was forgotten. It wasn't piping hot, it wasn't baked with the garlic ( the roasted garlic was served separate) there just wasn't any rich, buttery taste. The quality definitely justify the price of $14. (3/10)NZ ribeye ( medium rare) - tip: order a level below how well cooked you like your steak as it is serve on a hot plate and by the time the plate cools down it would have cooked the steak abit more .Potion of the meat is just right , about 250g. The quality of the meat is decent for this price. Comes with a side of baked potato and choice of sour cream, bacon bits and spring onions.Do avoid the garlic bread under you are very hungry though. It's free but usually comes cold
