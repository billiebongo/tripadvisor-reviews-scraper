The place to come if you are into authentic Thai home cooked food. This place run by 2 Thai ladies who really know their stuff.

Great thai food. One of the best thai meals I've had. Definitely worth a visit. Tara who taught at palate sensations is a very talented chef. Every dish we tried was really good.

I was introduced by my buddy to this awesome Yummilicious thai cafe. When i arrived, immediately the smell of Yummilicious thai food made me even more hungry. Sat down n first thing that caught my eyes was the chicken skin. Omg.... Super Yummilicious! In fact all the dishes we ordered were super delicious. I'd definitely introduce to all my local friends n thai friends here. Well done Sweet Basil. Absolutely Yummilicious n very affordable.

What a wonderful find. Looks like this place has just opened and the food here is incredible. Just follow your nose at the Adelphi and you can't miss it. Just the smell alone makes you hungry. Once inside, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. The food here tastes just like home cooked authentic Thai food. The chicken wings however are out of this world. By far the best I have ever eaten, absolutely delicious. This is my new favorite place to eat.

Sweet Basil by Tara.... Discovered this cafe while checking out old vinyl records and headphones at The Adelphi, this mall is linked to I.T. Mall Funan centre via a link bridge.. I followed the aroma of deliciousness to this gem of a Thai eatery. had the best wings ever , so tasty with the accompanying herbs ie pandanus, lemongrass n kafir lime leaves. For the main course, I had their seafood Tom Yum soup with rice to complete my meal. Def recommended if you're looking for a tasty fix
