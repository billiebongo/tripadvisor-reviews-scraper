It is sad that they have moved out from Plaza 8 to changi village road, It is one of my favorite places to eat and the mushroom soup is one of the best I have had in Singapore.

The salads are out of this world, I have been over 7 times & always order a plate of salad, mixed. They give me a sample of each & it's salvitating! Then the fresh baked bread, kneaded & baked on the spot! perfect with the Adana Kebab. Together with a Pizza, Hummus, drinks & deser, approx S$80 & enough for the family 2 adults + 2 kids

I have never given many restaurant's this high rating, this is one of my top 5 favourite restaurants , i have been their regular customer since their ECP and Parkway Parade outlet but now unfortunately they are closed and now they have opened it in Changi Business Park Crescent, Their food has improved a lot it is now twice as good then it was.I have tried almost every on of their dishes, all of them have a unique taste, it is a very authentic Turkish restaurant. My top favourite dishes there is Pita Roll,Lamachun(Turkish Pizza) and kebab Rice. These are my top favourite dishes it is very delicious . It is well price because of the authenticity of its food , going there is always worth i

I use to be regular at their ECP outlet , however, somehow lost them after they moved out from ECP as that area went under upgrading.Finally, located their outlet at changi village and was happy to experience the same taste again. Their outlet is at Block#1 which is the first block on your right when you turn into the Changi Village road, its facing the road and easy to locate.I have tried many items from their menu before and have always enjoyed their taste and flavor. Among my personal favorite is their Pita Roll, Lahmacun, iskender , oven kofta and baklava. What I like about them is the taste, flavor, friendly service and reasonable pricing. Their ambience is average though, but can be easily ignored for their tasty food

I lost them for about 3ish years when they moved out of east coast park. Finally found them tonight at Changi Village. I am not a Turkish food connoisseur but have tried a few Turkish place even overseas, but this is still the better one.I have been going to them for a few years and probably had tried most if not the entire menu. Verdict: great food, good value.Also the owner is friendly and doesn't mind introducing the menu to a non Turkish even when it's peak hours, this personality and the quality of the food is really what started me coming to them.Well done guys. Now don't go moving away again without informing me.
