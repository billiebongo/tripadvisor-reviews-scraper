Attended a CNY dinner with my business partner. Food and service was not impressive. However, the atmosphere was good and valet service is provided.
5
fantastic food. dim sum is very fresh. service staff is also very attentive and friendly. the best shredded scallop with egg white that i have tried. yummy
4
Valet parking was convenient. Very packed. Peking duck was ok, abalone was so -so, salad was ok, shark fin soup was good, fired whole fish was so-so. Price was high for the food, but the experience was worthwhile.

The Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant is located in a somewhat "out of the way" and strange location. We took a taxi to get there. It was just at the end of the Chinese New Year and dishes were presented to support this.The food was of mixed quality with some very good and other dishes with which we struggled. So, mixed successes on the food front. The changing views of Singapore as the restaurant revolves is the key selling point for this restaurant.Our visit was spoiled by the staff being unable to book a taxi for us at the end of the dinner and we ended up standing outside for about an hour

Went with family of 8 for dinner .its really a joke. Ordered one of the dishes peking duck of about 70 bucks. About 25 pieces of skin came with some condiments. top up another 30 dollars for frying the the balance of the duck with noodles. Came 7 bowls of noodles with fragments of duck meat that barely makes up from a drum stick. U pay 100 plus for the duck and all u get is 25 pieces of skin and 7 bowls of noodles with small pieces shredded meat. Total rip off. I will not mention the rest. U have been warned. Another reviewer posted the same thing and its 100 percent true! No integrity at all!

Went to have dinner at the Prima on the 3rd Feb, 18.We have high regard for this place. we remembered they served tasty cantonese food. We brought our children there when they will kids.We have not been there since than . I am 56year old. this is the first time I write a review. I wish i took pictures for the food we ordered. 1.Peking Duck (the skin was just thrown on the plate and serve it wasn't even properly arrange.) the skin was over done. Its the worst i ever eaten.2.Pork strip w/egg (this dish look as if a person who doesn't knows how to cook .throw everything inside and serve. This dish is a mess) 3.Chicken HP B/Less this is their recommended dish (the taste average but the dish looks mushy it is really not presentable.) 4. Chinese Pan Cake (the Skin is soft) 5. The Peking Duck meat was use to cook noodle (Very Salty) 6. Prawns w'pepper (this dish is not too bad just over cook the prawn is tough.) I paid $327.00. The service here is bad . ( iphone got no battery ask for charger .they don't have this service,Staff no where to be seem.At first we were looking for Staff to charge our phone, than add more water to our tea, than to get the bill.This price that i pd would have been a fine dinning restaurant.With at least a certain level of service.The dish presentation is so poor.It does not leave to the standard of PrimeThe taste and presentation of the food cannot even compare to a Zhi Char.Its very dissappointing.

Taken here by a friend who knows I love dockyards. Restaurant locations don't come much better than this where I am concerned. The restaurant revolves so that over the hour we were there, tucking into excellent Dim Sum, we saw an entire 360 degree view of the huge container port and the surrounding city / countryside. Food was great. Arriving through what is essentially part of a flour factory is really strange but in a good way. Highly recommended
5
Went for lunch with our good friends and you would need to be a local to know about this place. Outside we were parked beside containers and trucks at the port. The restaurant is built on top of an old wheat silo!Food and service was awesome but almost no English was spoken so it may have been harder without a local to help
5
Great view and delicious food. This building is on a flour mill factory. This is a slow revolving restaurant. The view covers sentosa, port and city. Try their dim sum or group set meal for 2, 4, 6 or 10 people. Nearest mrt station is at harbor front

My husband and went to Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant with another couple when we had a stopover. We decided to have the yum Cha, which was ordered from the menu. Choices were extensive and we appreciated the assistance given by the staff. My husband is allergic to shellfish so it was reassuring to have the ingredients explained when they were not clear. Whilst the food and service would be enough to recommend this restaurant the view makes it very special. We were there for more than a revolution and enjoyed looking over the different views. Also adding to the atmosphere was the position on top of an old silo. All in all it was a special dining experience
3
Chinese restaurant with nostalgic family feel. First time here with parents and all. Enjoyed the revolving view of Sentosa & Singapore as well as Cantonese dishes. Worth a shot before the view up there changes
2
Got there before 6.30, thinking we could have a drink before dinner, apparently not.
Than had soft shell crab, which was un eatable, followed by crispy duck , served with tomato sauce (wtf)! When we acquired ,?we where told that was the traditional Condamine .

Came for lunch for a birthday just two of us. We made a booking in advanced and got a table by the window. Seems most tables by the window are larger ones though we could see they can reconfigure, but if coming as a couple do check it out with them if tables available and reserve.The revolving takes about 1.5 hours, so take your time to enjoy the food as you savor the unobstructed sights of Singapore. Yes half of it was of the port but that was also in itself an educational experience too. We had dim sum and not the main cooked dishes. And they were fast to be served and good to taste. Very reasonable prices too considering the premium views. Our opinion is stick to the Cantonese dimsum and try the Beijing ones only if you are prepared to sample something really different. See photos for more comments.Saw the menu for the cooked dishes and also when they were served out to other patrons in the next tables. Appears to be reasonably large servings so ask before ordering too many dishes. Very suitable for families to celebrate occasions though the flight of stairs from the lift can be hard to negotiate for those with walking difficulties. Valet parking available as there is little space around the factory area

We decided to visit this restaurant since it was sometime since we dined there. The service and food quality in the past was excellent.However, this trip there was disappointing. Their service level has dropped tremendously (slow and obviously understaffed) and the food tasted horrible, with the exception of their signature dried scallop & egg white dish, which still tasted ok but not as delicious as in the past. We ordered Venison meat on hotplate which tasted not fresh and the meat was burnt. The vegetables served were cheap vegetables and they actually sold the dish for about S$20! Ridiculous pricing!We will never dine there again. Money is better spent at other revolving restaurants.

We had dinner celebration at the restaurant on Father's day. The restaurant was full, so we were glad that we had made a reservation. On first impression, i am impressed with how well-maintained the place was. You could not tell that the restaurant is 40 years old at all, and my father mentioned that he had visited 25 years ago. The revolving view was very nice! It take about 2 hours for one complete round, which i think is just the right speed - any faster you may get dizzy. You can enjoy unblocked views of the port, Sentosa, the CBD area while you dine. As the restaurant is on the 9 floor, there are 2 "food lifts" which delivers the food from the kitchen which is probably on the ground level. They are well-staffed, and service is good. They help to serve the food onto small plates so you do not need to worry about standing up and distributing the food yourself. The portion of the food is generous, and priced about right. The Shredded Scallops with Fish and Egg White is definitely worth a try, as it is very tasty, and a good (better, flavourful) alternative to shark's fin soup. The steamed fish was very fresh and big as well. It was good that they had a fixed price for the fish instead of the usual market price whereby you do not know the price before it was time to pay

This location is a little bit away from the trotten path, but nevertheless worth a visit. It sits atop a wheat silo and overlooks the old port area, a view that will not be there forever as the port will be moving west. One takes an elevator to level 9, then an escalator and a flight of stairs to the restaurant, which does not only have a nice view, but which is also revolving. The food is genorous from a portion point of view, we were two and had the house specialty Peking duck, which is first served as per the tradition with the crisp skin wrapped in pancakes, the rest then came later with red pepper and spring onions. We also ordered a sweetcorn and crabmeat soup, but this was in hindsight too much, almost a third of the duck we took home. The jasmine tea was also a nice accompanier, we did not miss a wine - which is also available at reasonable prices. We will clearly come back again, next time a bit earlier to have an even better view
4
We finally made it to this restaurant after hearing about it for over 20 years thanks to a local friend. He made prior dinner reservations and secured a table next to the window. We were told this restaurant was a piece of Singapore Chinese cuisine history as some of its recipes were as old as the aged customers gathering around us. It certainly attracted lots of multi-generation family diners. It was wonderful to experience a revolving restaurant, which was also the world's only located on top of a wheat silo. The views of the surrounds were amazing. We arrived early enough to watch day slowly transform to night, and the docks and Sentosa twinkled in the dark.We left the ordering to our friend and ended up with too much food. Our favorites were the signature shredded scallops with fish and egg white, tossed with a raw egg yolk and served with optional black vinegar and white pepper. The crispy and juicy Peking duck skin slices contrasted with the thin and chewy Chinese flour wraps. The braised sea cucumber were sizable chucks wrapped in a light brown sauce. The taste profile of the dishes were interesting or delicious but didn't border on Beijing cuisine. We'd spent enough time in Beijing to taste the different. The food was more classic Singapore Chinese and reminisce of the old style Cantonese restaurants.Service was also reminisce of old Singapore Chinese restaurants. They were borderline friendly and very eager to serve the food and remove dishes. Unfortunately not too passionate about service or attentive to diner needs and overall dining experience.We had wonderful company, panoramic views, tasty food and were glad to know the bill came up to less than $200 for 8 dishes and Chinese tea

I went there with my family to celebrate CNY. Service was good and quick and the food was good especially the Pekin Duck. They have a good selection of dim sum. Location is nice as the restaurant is above the Harbour with a nice view on the city and Sentosa.
4
Celebrated my mum's 82nd birthday with my brother's family and mine here, and it was the first time dining in a revolving restaurant for my son, niece and nephews.We ordered the Set Dinner for 10 pax and Chef Chan's signature dishes always do not disappoint, in particular, the BBQ Peking Duck and the Sliced abalone with broccoli & sea cucumber in special sauceWe had complimentary birthday buns and as it was close to the Mooncake Festival, a complimentary box of mooncakes came with the set dinner.The panoramic view ( we requested a table next to the window ) and the wholesome feast surely wowed my mum!

Was there for my parent wedding anniversary dinnner. The restaurant ambient is great with great view. Great and clean interior, the toilet is very well kept and clean. The aircon is good. The service is so so. So manage your expectation. But the food is good, especially the peking duck
4
It is a place that is worth trying for the view and for the Great Dim Sum.
The service is great
Enjoy it with your family

Place needs renovations quickly. Food was ok not anything special. Ordered duck, fried rice, soup and veggies. Duck was average.

If you are driving, then do not patronize this restaurant. I had my car scratched badly by the car valet. The car valet service is bad and slow and you never know where they park your cars at the construction site. While the food quality is reasonably commendable, it is not worth to take the risks of driving car to this restaurant. The management does not view your feedback seriously and you suffered being ridiculed by the car valet actions
5
Had been put off by the not so great reviews but decided to try for ourselves as we live nearby. It is a bit of a strange arrival . The car park is full of containers and once inside the building which is an old flour mill you feel as if you have stepped back into the 70s. However once you arrive at the restaurant ( which was practically empty on a Tuesday night) the view is magnificent and the service was very attentive. The Peking Duck was excellent and the fried rice, vegetables and prawns some of the best I have eaten and I have lived in Asia for 30 years. It was very reasonably priced too. So glad we didn't get put off by the negative reviews . We will be back
4
Although the restaurant may not look posh as it may appear slightly jaded, the choice of dim sum and the quality is very good. Coupled with this, you will have a panoramic view of Sentosa, Western side of Shenton Way (Wall Street of Singapore) and Alexander area
5
We went as a group of 11 and we had the Mid-Autumn special set menu. The food was excellent and we enjoyed almost every dish, especially the Peking duck. On top of that, the set came with a free box of mooncake.The 360 degree night view was great and service was good, although at times it took some time to catch their attention.Overall it was a good dining experience

I have patronised this restaurant since I was a little girl and I remembered good food, great views and good family times together.Last Sunday, I went with my husband and children and it isn't the same anymore. Understandably, without any apparent renovations, the restaurant now looks old and worn out. The lobby downstairs is jaded and dusty, the waiting couches are stained and old. The restaurant revolves but it jerks at times.The dim sum itself was ok but the century egg porridge was starchy, thick and not flavourful. It is only served on Sundays and public holidays, by the way. The pork ribs served with sweet and sour sauce, and pepper/salt combination was terrible. The ribs had been fried in a batter which was doughy and soft. We ordered the ee fu mian which was salty and watery.We found it difficult to get any staff's attention even though the restaurant was not full. When the staff cleared the dishes, the staff standing on my right passed two empty dishes to her colleague standing on my left, right in front of my face. They narrowly missed hitting my face, I had to retreat to miss being hit and having the dishes and gravy landing on me.If you are there for the view, it's great. The dim sum is generally ok but nothing spectacular, I can get better dim sum at other Cantonese restaurants. I don't think I'll ever go back there again. Very sad

We called to make a reservation for 9pm and was told last order will be 930pm and they close at 1030pm.We arrived timely at 9pm and placed our orders for set meal immediately. 1. Food arrived in sequence of the menu. Serving time was pretty fast. 2. We were served dish after dish even though we have not finished the previous dishes. Our plates where just moved around by the staff to fit the dishes in front of us.3. The service staff kept loitering around our table and looking at us as if they can't wait to clear our empty plates. 4. With such a big hint from them, we asked what time do they close again. The staff replied grumpily "we knock off at 930 and close at 10"... what does this even mean?? The website states 1030pm?! How can the staff knock off before the restaurant close? 5. By 940pm, dessert was just shoved on our table despite us still eating the main dishes. 6. While eating, the staff made a lot of noises from the shuffling of the bowls and plates setting up the tables near us. 7. Bill came at 950pm... for a food bill of $240 for 2 pax, I would have expected better service. 8. They had not taken the initiative to refill our tea. Service standard has dropped drastically compaed to the older aunties whom used to work there since our last visit 2 years ago.On the food: 1. Abalone dish was a little tough, the broccoli and mushrooms seems to be just blanched briefly2. Shark fin soup was thick and plain, chicken shreds was tough. 3. Sauce for the cod fish was salty4. Egg white dish and hashima on the other hand was OK. In summary, terrible service experience and food was not up to standard.

My family of 6 adults and 2 young kids had our lunch at the Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant located at 201 Keppel Road, Singapore. The Restaurant itself is situated on top of a former flour mill and is slightly off the main road next to the Vivo City Shopping Mall. Diners at the Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant can enjoy a good view of the city and the surrounding areas including the Sentosa Island. The Restaurant specializes in Chinese Cuisine which includes the ever popular ‘Dim Sum’. My family enjoyed our lunch as the food was good. Worth dropping by for the good food and enjoy the unique setting of this Restaurant when you visit Vivo City or Sentosa

Situated at the top of the old factory almost next to ViviCity, accessible. However accessibility stops pretty much here, if I didn't remember wrongly, there's no wheelchair facilities beyond the lift which brings you to two levels below the restaurant. Decor in the restaurant needs update but that aside, the view is awesome and we could pretty much say this is 'old charm'.. If my nose didn't play trick on me, smell of the toilet was apparent enroute to the restaurant.. Not pleasing.. The bad aside.. We were there for dim sum. Pleasantly surprise with the quality of food! Good selection on the menu and pricing was alright at circa 4.80/item.. The service was timely and the servers were friendly.. My old parents were happy about the food! Very seldom do they complain about 'non authenticity'....Will be back
5
This was very nice and the service was good .The view was spectacular.The staff were very good as at catering to a huge crowd in our tour group.It was very memorable experience seeing Singapore slowly moving around us !
5
Always love this place. I have fond memories of having the dimsum here. Great view and reasonably priced. This is a good place to take your family and friends for a relaxing dinner
5
Great dim sum lunch - the Beijing Duck is awesome - in a revolving restaurant on top of a flour silo. Excellent panoramic views of the CBD, West Cost, Sentosa and Singapore Port.

Revolving Restaurant was perched high with a majestic unblock view of Singapore skyline and Sentosa island.Food was rather unusual but tasty indeed. Service was at best good as restaurant was full during dinner hours. However aircon was not cold enough for comfort. Overall feel was as if in 1980s with a musky stench at lift lobby area. Should change carpeting
3
We ate here on a smoggy evening when the view was almost obscured. It would have been of Sentosa and lights of ships coming and going. If you do want the view, get seated at a table by the window, not in the inner ring of tables. We went as part of a very large group seated at many 10-person tables. The dishes kept coming as they were prepared but very few of them met expectations. The soup was mostly corn. There was one exceptional spicy shrimp dish (yummy) and excellent fruit at the end. Service was spotty, tea and water minimal. Bar service slow
3
We were with a large group of people. We were seated at tables of 10. It was very cramped at the table. The service was very slow. We had to ask for water glasses to be refilled. It was a nine course dinner. We had one person at our table who requested a vegetarian meal. They brought out 2 courses and said that was it - nothing else. TIP: If you want to take pictures of the views as the restaurant revolves, place the lens of the camera on the window glass and take the picture. This will avoid the reflection of the inside lights on your picture

Our extended family of 12 decided to indulge ourselves in a nice Chinese dinner and headed down to the Prima Revolving Restaurant after making reservations yesterday.The restaurant was about 80-90% full on a Saturday night. Most of the large tables were filled, leaving only a few small 2 to 4 seaters. The view was great, you will get to see the fireworks from the Universal Studios. I wanted to bring my kids here to experience the last revolving restaurant left in Singapore. The restaurant is tucked away at the top of a flour factory silo (at level 9) so you do have to navigate yourself through an industrial building, past some flour silos before getting to the restaurant, quite an interesting and atypical experience compared to other dining establishments!We ordered the Prosperity Set Meal 1 at $988++ for 10 as we had 6 young kids out of the 12 people around the dining table. The food was not bad. The braised supreme shark's fin was filled to the brim with slivers of the fins (although we usually refrain from this dish, it was part of the set meal and there was no other option available), Peking Duck (their signature) was nice and crispy with the typical condiments and egg flour wrap. The kids loved the egg white cooked with shreds of scallop and fish meat (also another signature dish). The chilli lobster was good (the gravy was similar to the chilli crabs), would have been ideal to have this dish with some buns to dip in the gravy. We had fried seafood noodle filled with prawns, fish meat and chunks of sea cucumber, good for those who are into seafood. Desserts were fresh fruits and Prima's famous toffee banana stuffed with red bean paste. The waitress soaked the hot fried toffee bananas in a dish of ice water to cool the outsides and also dissolve a bit of the toffee so she could take them apart for serving. What I didn't quite like was the fried abalone stuffed with meat and mushroom, I couldn't find the abalone at all, it would have been better for them to have served either sliced abalone or whole baby abalones. I couldn't quite get used to the starter which was deep fried four treasures (essentially deep fried herbal tea leaves with fried pieces of chicken, fish, mushroom and bamboo shoots). Chinese restaurants usually serve the cold platter which is a mix of fried and chilled starters. The charges for the extras were pretty steep too - $2 per person for the wait staff to supply tea (essentially topping up the tea pot with hot water multiple times and recycling the same tea leaves), 50 cents for a piece of wet tissue, $4 per small dish of appetiser ($2 for braised nuts plus $2 for salted vegetables).Service was reasonable, it was a busy night and we had to wait a while to catch the attention of the wait staff, which was fair. Each time, the staff did get back to us with whatever we asked for.Overall, I would say food was generally good except for one or two dishes, service was decent, location a bit off the usual dining venues (on the way to Sentosa) but definitely an interesting find with great 360-degree views from the revolving restaurant

Went to this restaurant to celebrate my mum's bday over the weekend. We booked 3 tables and they insisted my mum make a trip down to pay a deposit.We had a 8 course set meal for 8 pax each (their max) and because we had 25 pax, we had to pay extra for that 1 pax (which is grossly over priced for ala carte). Order some drinks and 1 extra bowl of dessert, the total bill came to SGD$2300.Despite the hefty price tag, it was filled to the brim. The service was so slow. We reached at 7pm and requested them to serve the dinner and it's not until 730pm that the 1st course was served. by the time the dinner ended, it was 10pm and we couldn't be more tired due to the waiting time in between dishes. The food isn't bad but it's not worth the wait and price
3
Visited the restaurant to celebrate an elder's birthday. Food was so so only. Some were too salty and some were rather tasteless. 2 family members felt uncomfortable after eating the food and thought there was too much msg in the food. Spent $200+. Not worth the visit of not for the view.
4
I went here for a lunch with a business associate. I was very pleased. The Dim Sum was delicious and the service great. It was not crowded at all. The atmosphere is very unique. I would return happily. I would like to try the Peking Duck next time though
5
What an experience dining at a revolving restaurant. The view was amazing and the food was great. Good thing is I don't have dizziness problem so the experience was really enjoyable for me and for my hubby as well :)
4
Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 10 people earlier in the week, my first visit to this apparently well known Singapore restaurant. For simplicity we opted for the set dinner and the food ended up being quite good. The Peking Duck wasn't prepared in quite the same professional manner as you might expect in a top end place in Beijing, but it was still fairly crispy and not bad for Singapore. Good views out over the port and the revolving element is popular with young children
3
Had a family dinner here on Saturday. The entrance to the restaurant is very difficult to enter due to a lot of stairs and no lift so beware if you have walking difficulties. We had a baby and a pram so not easy to access, also there are no baby changing facilites!!!!!!The views are good, looking over Sentosa and the Container Berths. Play and Work!!The Dim Sum was good with a good variety, and the service was average.A pleasant time spent with family!!
4
Dim Sum and Peking Duck were fresh and delicious at the top of this tower. The revolving restaurant shows you everything in Singapore while enjoying your lunch. They prepare the pancakes with the duck skin for you, but you can ask to make your own if you prefer. Good atmosphere
4
Situated behind St. James Power Station, which is opposite VivoCity shopping mall. If walking easiest to take the footbridge from Vivo shopping mall (situated to right of cinema entrance) across the road, and then take the temporary footpath that borders the main road (there are a couple of signs to Prima if you keep a look out), into the car parking area, watching for lorries and forklift trucks, walk to the left and you will see the entrance to Prima on right - don't be too put off by the rather scruffy appearance. Lift up to 9th floor, then escalator up, and lastly easy climb spiral steps up to the restaurant entrance. Large circular room with windows all round. If booking ahead, be sure to request a table by the window, as there inner tables too. Absolutely magnificent views across the container port (a huge part of Singapore's trade) and very interesting to be able to see so much detail, the containers being moved about so quickly and effortlessly, the container ships arriving etc.. As view pans round, across golf course to Sentosa (private residential area and then on to Resort World), the cable cars, the harbour at VivoCity (where some of the cruise ships dock) and across to the City. Photos come out really well as the windows are so large and nothing to obstruct the views. The outer part of the tower turns and I estimate it turned 25% of the view in 45 minutes.The service / attitude to customers certainly isn't the best. Offered tea on arrival and tap water and braised peanuts etc. put on the table, together with napkins in foil - all of which are chargeable (check your bill to ensure that you have not been automatically charged for tea etc. if you declined ..). The food was served hot (which isn't always the case here in Singapore), not all the dishes arriving together, the portions are large, with one main dish and one rice being sufficient for two persons. Taste average. We dined at lunchtime and were informed by the Captain they closed at 2.30 pm - and it was very evident that they preferred you leave by that time - no lingering.All in all, well worth the visit to be able to see the container port, Sentosa and the surrounding areas with such clarity. I suggest you visit in the evening, arrive when the restaurant opens, 6.30 pm ?, and then you will be able to see the views in daylight and then see the skyline change with the night sky. I recommend a visit
4
Bought 2 foreign friends there for dinner on a Sunday and had great food with attentive service. The restaurant revolves 360 degrees and gives a good view of Sentosa and the port of Singapore ( early evening while there is light ).Try the peking duck - it is worth it. Then get them to cook the leftover duck meat with noodles - yum! The only complain I had was the costly fish with lots of bone and very little meat
3
This revolving restaurant that displays several of its many awards as one of the best in Singapore can be reached by going straight to the 9th floor. Our group had dimsum selections such as shanghai and shrimp dumplings, barbecued pork buns, crab roe dumplings, prawn raviolis with salad cream, deep fried crispy roll with crab stick and the yang zhou fried rice. For dessert we had the melon and sago in coconut milk. For drinks we had sodas and refillable warm tea. Staff service is quite erratic but it is not a big issue with me. While the restaurant offer sweeping views more than half of it focuses on the shipping port industry and the not so attractive skyline. The good spot is the one in Sentosa , but that depends how long you stay and the area where you are seated first.I noticed that the views are not that nice when it is during daytime. Maybe having dinner there would make for a good ambiance 
4
This is my second visit to this Chinese restaurant which was once a flour mill. Located on the 11 floor(lift goes up to level 9 only).One must take an escalator and climb a spiral step up.Their chef has done an excellent job all these years by maintaining a high standard. Must try is their signature dishes are mock crab meat and crispy Peking duck. As personal taste differ, I have posted a few pictures and recommend you try it yourself to believe. But do hurry as I heard that they will vacate from this unique place with 360 degrees vie
3
Come here for family dim sum lunch. We order pork dumpling with prawn, prawn dumpling, baked bbq pork , deep fried banana with prawn , steamed cake, dumpling soup, steamed pork ribs, prawn chee chong fan and mango pudding for dessert.Overall the food nice and service goodThe best of all is the view from this revolving restaurant
5
I am a frequent visitor of this restaurant for family events. Apart from the novelty of a revolving restaurant and scenic views, it has the best 'mock crab meat' or scallop with fish and egg white. Other must tries: - the peking duck skin with its crispy skin and tangy sauce and duck meat fried to perfection (or with noodles, your choice), steamed fish which is authentic and fresh, stewed pork with buns is lean, tangy with a good vineger-y gravy..
5
Many many choises to eat.
If you like fish, chicken, duck, whatever its taste very good.
There is a nice view over the city because the restaurant is revolving.
It is very clean and I m sure you like it
I recommend it

Pros
(1) Food was of high quality. Peking duck was excellent. The lobster was cooked very nicely with garlic.
(2) Not too crowded.
(3) Nice views.
(4) Service was good.
Cons
(1) Entrance to lift lobbies rather grotty.
(2) Small lift.
5
This Restaurant provides first class service, plus a first class view.
After dinner, make your way up to the sky bar to experience the sights of Singapore whilst relaxing over a cold drink.
Do not miss the opportunity.

Dine at this restaurant twice, once for dim sum and once for dinner. I must say that the view from the restaurant is great. You can see sentosa, vivocity etc. and the view changes each time you look out of the restaurant. Service is attentive...Dim sum is good overall and prices are more reasonable. We had dinner there recently and i find the price is at the steep side, also the food served is ok, but nothing fantastic. Would recommand for dim sum and lunch set ...Photos and reviews:http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/08/eat-prima-tower-revolving-restaurant.htm

A revolving restaurant at Singapore had been recommended by a colleague and as we were on a stopover on our way home to New Zealand from Europe we made a point of dining here. Prima is the only revolving restaurant so we were confident of a great time. The hotel concierge made the booking for us and we could not dine until 8.30 pm, which was fine, and then in the row away from the window, also fine as we were there for the food. We arrived by taxi and found our way up in the lift and up some stairs covered in tired, 80s cinema carpet. We were curtly escorted to our table which was by the window as there were very few people dining. All so-so, so far. The ambience was zero, the staff not very welcoming, the food ok, but not knock your socks off. The restaurant started to empty and the staff cleaned up around us and then we were proffered the bill as a hurry up. We were certainly ready to go! We had the waiter order us a taxi ( very difficult, you may have to walk!!) and actually joined him in the lift going down. As soon as we were outside the lights were turned off! Fortunately the taxi did arrive as the restaurant is located in the wilderness of the port. Not an ideal dining experience and not to be recommended

Revolving restaurants are not a novelty anymore and their attractiveness has faded with time. The Prima Tower, nevertheless, continues to be a curiosity (built on the top of a still functioning wheat silo) and to offer splendid views over the continuously changing skyline and harbor landscape of Singapore, along with food that is tasty and served in large portions. It is best to opt for a set menu, in our case it was excellent (only the dessert was disappointing both in quantity and in taste). The service is efficient and friendly

this is the 2nd time i've been brought to this restaurant, and the consistency of the Chinese cuisine makes the experience predictably pleasant. the location is ironic, in that it is beside a flour mill and a container shipyard. but the food is oh so good. as it is a revolving restaurant, you should not be surprised if you can sense movement around you. for a very brief moment, though, it was uncomfortable as it felt like the entire floor was stopping/starting. no other diners appeared to have felt it (or they were accustomed to it), but being from Manila & sensitive to earthquakes, it was just a little bit disconcerting. overall, highly recommended.

We were invited to the Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant for lunch. That was my first visit to the restaurant. I was fascinated by the revolving concept and impressed by the panoramic view, PSA, Sentosa, Keppel Bay, Mt Faber, CBD, cable cars, ships, containers... The food was so so. I can only remember the signature dish, Shredded Scallops with Fish and Egg White because the egg was overcooked, and another dish, Stewed Pork Ribs (Served with Buns). The stewed pork ribs was as tough as well-done steak. It is a nice place for family gatherings. Nice ambience, great service and okay food. Maybe should try the dim sum next time

So, it was the annual Mother's Day cum Mother's birthday celebratory dinner, and this year, the chosen venue was Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant. The reason why I chose this restaurant was because of its interesting revolving concept, thus offering sweeping views and taking panoramic scenes to another level altogether. The other reason is because this place was where my mother brought my grandmother to eat at, 30 years ago too, when my maternal grandmother was still alive.The first item arrived - Shredded Scallops with Fish and Egg White (medium, SGD$45.00) - it looked different from the photo I saw online at their website, but we were assured that it was the very same one. We were encouraged to add vinegar to it, so we gave it a shot. The dish was tasty with the sapid flavor of egg white and sweetness of scallops and fish. It was an interesting item, cooked to be something that tasted like, say, dry shark's fin soup or dry fish maw soup kind of taste. We liked it.Next up, we had the Authentic Peking Duck (SGD$65.00) - oh well, the skin portion first. It was very crispy and tasty - and we loved the egg-flavored flour skin it came with for the wrap. There was black sweet bean paste sauce, cucumber slices and spring onion stalks served together for the wrap too. After quite a while, we finally got to see and taste the rest of the duck. It was so tender, I couldn't help having 2 - 3 pieces because the flesh nearly melted in one's mouth. The taste was light but the aroma of fresh duck meat was eminent. This was a keeper for sure.Finally, we ended the meal with Fried Ee-fu Noodles (small, SGD$20.00) - this one contained ingredients such as chives, chicken strips, mushrooms and beansprouts. The noodles was quite tasty, but somehow it lacked the deliciousness of ee-fu noodles served during some wedding banquets. Something missing?For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/dinner-at-prima-tower-revolving.html?m=

This is the place for a good chinese meal and a place mainly visited by loyal locals. Location is out of the touristic zones and in the middle of a container terminal on top of a grain silo. Primo's Bejing style Interior did not change since 1977 but this is the way traditional Chinese restaurants often look like, So if you look for a fancy place do not come here. If you come for a great chinese food experience this is your local venue.Some dishes that I realy like and can recomment: off course Peking Duck with the crispy skin of the roast duck wrapped in a thin Chinese pancake, and the tasty Shredded Scallops with Fish and Egg White and SautÃ©ed Garlic King Prawns by Hong Kong Master Chef Chan.The restaurant is revolving in appr. 2 hours so depending on the time of day you have a view on the container terminal and Sentosa island

An OLD revolving restaurant that took 2 hours to complete its round. It is located near Sentosa Island. I enjoyed the dim sum served. especially the "小笼包“。The scenery was great, overlooking the Sentosa, Universal Studio.

Interesting to see the scenery changes as it revolve. We were there for dinner and see the sun setting and the scenery changing. Food is expensive as expected. Quality is same as any typical Chinese restaurant.

This is the only revolving restaurant in Singapore offering a good view of the city centre and sentosa Island.The food is good and the price is reasonable.

We were assured of good Beijing cooking but were disappointed. The B - Duck was dry and tasteless.the service was poor and not what you might expect in Singapore.....as far as the view was concerned, forget it.

This was the nr. 1 restaurant in Singapore during 1985. Really !!!We stayed at the Hyatt, had a babysitter for our children .... And then dinner here. We started the meal and finished it after the restaurant had revolved all around. I still remember the seafood entre, salad and main dish in this lovely restaurant, atmosphere and how nice it all was. Excellent service. Singapore is so efficient !!!Met some lovely english guests in the cocktail bar .... Sociable !!

Had several issues with this restaurant. Mainly because there is no direct lift to the restaurant floor. A very pregnant me and my hubby had to handle a toldder, an infant and a stroller up a flight of steps. Although the revolution was very slow. Almost an hour for a round, I could still feel the movement and it made me a bit giddy throughout the meal. Food portions were generous. Some dishes were tastier than others. - 4 seasons dumpling was very nicely created (asethetically); dessert fried donut dough with red bean paste was delicious too. Unlikely to return though. Quite a hassle to get to the place

Although the decor is dated, the food is good. The shredded scallop and egg is arguably the best chinese starter I have ever had. My table of 5 loved it too. The Duck was served in two different styles and the Lassa Rice spicy and tasty. All in all a great night of Chinese food. We loved it

In the 1970's, when it was new this must have been the place to go, but now it is dated and desperately in need of an upgrade. It is also in an ugly part of the city, surrounded by a container port. The restaurant revolves slowly, but because of its location there is little to see, certainly nothing worth looking at. Better views can be had elsewhere in the city. We were part of a large group and we were meant to be having a Gala Dinner here. We had a Chinese meal consisting of several courses. The food was prepared near the tables, but there wasn't really enough so everyone could only take a small portion. The lifts were aged and worrying. They sounded an alarm and stopped if overloaded, so it took ages to get all of our large party up to the restaurant. I am sorry, I hate giving poor reviews but this place needs smart ending up and bringing into the 21st century. The staff were fairly pleasant. But, having said all that we had a really fun evening - the food and view didn't contribute much

Prima Restaurant is one of two revolving restaurant in Singapore and the only one in the world located a top a grain silo. Upon our arrival we took the lift to the top and walked up to the circular steps which took us straight to the restaurant. The staff welcomed us and directed us to our table. Immediately after we sat down, one part of the table wasn't closing properly and it kept hitting my leg all the time and we had to ask the staff for assistance more than once and the problem remained like that until the end of our dinner and we didn't bother to ask for assistance anymore.The food wasn't well plated. We ordered Pecking Duck and it was dry and tasteless.The vegetable and fried rice had no flavour and was very oily. The Singapore Slings was anaemic looking and it tasted like dirty coffeepot water. The wine was our salvation, thanks God!The staff service was very polite and attentive but they lack english language skills.The room took 75 minutes to revolve in one circle and it was very slow and not smooth at all.Prima Restaurant reminds me of Piz Gloria Restaurant in Schilthorn - Switerland just for the way it looks (minus the 007 James Bond logo on the windows). In my view this restaurant has a great potential to improve and the owner must revamp the whole restaurant, get well trained staff and a very good master chef. â€¨However what I Love about Prima Restaurant was the panoramic view and the wine and what I hate was having to pay for something not worth it!I would only recommend after a renovation

Visited this restaurant with some local Singapore friends for lunch, we started off looking over Sentosa Island and slowly revolved around looking over Singapore residential areas and then the container loading area at the docks. Containers do not sound so atractive but a really incredible view of all that is going on there. Our friends did all of the ordering and so we were spared trying to decide what we should and should not go for, all of the food was very well pepared and looked great, fantastic tasting food, good friendly servie, really liked this place. Not quite on the tourist trail but worth a visit

Great view. This place has an atmosphere of its own. Food was good.
Service got an average because the staff don't speak much English. Parking is not so easy but the location and atmosphere make up for it. Worth making a stop here.

Delicate Cantonese restaurant with great food and view. Service is superb.

I heard the Beijing Duck is the most authentic of commonly people has ordered

Good view to Sentosa!

Prima Tower Revolving Restaurant not only offers good food but fantastic view of Sentosa Island. This is the only revolving restaurant in Singapore. It may not be very convenient if you are not driving but it is well worth the trip. The nearest MRT station is Harbour Front station which is located below Vivo City Shopping Mall and the walk is about 15 minutes along Keppel Road. The way they prepare some of their signature dishes now and 20 year ago are and taste the same. The top of my pick is “Shredded Scallops with Fish and Egg White”, well you don’t see the fish and it really doesn’t taste like a fish dish. This is one dish that I have tried in several places and Prima is still one of the best.My other favourites are: Authentic Barbecued Peking Duck, Deep-fried Bean Curd with Prawn Roe. For desert I go for Souffle Balls with Mashed Bean Stuffing. Budget about S$40-S$50 per head and enjoy the night scene of southern Singapore with good food

The view is great, while the restaurant revolves you see Sentosa Island, The Harbor and the City skyline. We were fortunate to be before Christmas so add in some Christmas trees and decorations in Universal Studios and the nearby shopping mall.The food is excellent and the serving is beautiful. The service is excellent attentive

Some local friends of my brother recommend this restaurant to us. Our taxi driver does not even know there is a restaurant there and has to follow my brother’s taxi. It is close to Sentosa and is the only revolving restaurant in Singapore. When we arrive, it looks like we arrive amongst industrial buildings. We see the sign of the restaurant. Taking the elevator up to the top floor, we exit and have to go up the circular steps all the way to restaurant. The design may be for people to take wedding photos.It takes about 90 minutes for it to revolve one circle, a bit slower than expected. When going around, the gear doesn’t seem to be very smooth and I can feel like in a car the driver presses the brake all the time, especially if you sit in the anti-revolving direction. We order a 4 course meal plus dim sum. The food is so so as is expected for any sight seeing spots. It gives you a view of the whole city. The décor is like in the eighties. It is a bit expensive to have lunch at SGD300 for 5 people. To play safe, we ask the restaurant to call taxi for us when we leav

Been here a number of times and was never disappointed with the service and quality of food served at this restaurant. Think it's opened by one of the famous HK chef. The dim sum is great and the fish is very well done, not overcook and fresh too. The Peking duck is commendable. Do take note that they serve Peking duck in egg skin (yellow colour) and not the authentic white plain skin. While dining, the restaurant will turn 360 degrees slowly and allows the diner to enjoy the great views surrounding the restaurant. The restaurant is located on top of an old flour mill and thus, not very appealing on the outside. They do have valet parking though. One has to take the lift, and then up the escalators and then up a flight of spiral stairway to finally reach the entrance.Do check out the 赛螃蟹 as it's very tasty

Close to the City, Go there for lunch, 360 deg view of Singapore and Sentosa, perfect forthose with no time for sightseeing or the first overview. Reasonable prices, truly good food, especially dim sum. Been there dozens of times between 01/1990 and 12/2009and NEVER disappointed
