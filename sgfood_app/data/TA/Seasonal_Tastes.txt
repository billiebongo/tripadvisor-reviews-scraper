Went for buffet dinner, really enjoyed the food spread... Wide varaties and delicious! Would specially like to highlight a staff by the name of Nui, very helpful n knowledgeable... Very patient with all our requests. Definitely the right person in this industry. Would definitely return for more!! Thumbs up!

Overall good taste and spread, however the previous year had more variety and raw oyster included, otherwise a 5 sta

The seafood was fresh and spread of food was decent, however the oyster run out quite fast and replenishment was slow as the staff mention he has a strain arm. Maybe management could have deployed others to help out too? Was a bit disappointed as I did mention in the reservation it was for a Birthday celebration but nothing was done and the seat that we were placed were small, could have assigned us other seats as the restaurant was relatively empt
4
The spread is extensive with hits and misses but we focus on the good stuff. Cheese and ham platter was well done. Loved the lobsters but the rest was forgetable. The roast beef, pork ribs and salmon are the stars. Desert was decent
5
I have visited this restaurant twice, this time I have invited my two friends to join me. I wanted to compliment 1 of the staff Damen, he had provided excellent service
5
Had a great buffet dinner last Sat with 3 generations. Awesome view of the city from the Level 32 lobby. The food spread was most impressive. Restaurant was having a Thai Seafood theme and the spread was irresistable, from Chiangmai sausages; Phad Thai complete with lobsters, crabs and mussels; Beef Thai noddle with generous serving of meat, tripe, tendon and beef balls; green curry with special fish dumpling; to pumpkin custard and mango sticky rice. These were over and above the perennial international spread of cold seafood, exquisite cheeses and nuts, baked salmon, roast beef etc plus a very interesting dessert section. The avocado gelato and blood orange sorbert deserve special mention. Truly remarkable experience
5
Excellent service by the service staff. Variety of food is good. The thai selection can be much better
5
I have dinner in the restaurant with two of my friends last night. It met most of my criteria in terms of quality in taste, variety, price and location! Restaurant Manager Nui escorted us to a table with nice view and provided excellent service. My friends come from Europe and they were so satisfied with dinning Asian food in such enchanting ambience with all great service
5
Value for money, good quality food. Visit this place at least once a year for team event as it is close to office

Buffet spread was a bit disappointing especially the seafood selection. The crab claws were controlled tightly with limited refills. No oysters or scallops. There were prawns, lobster, flower crabs? Sashimi was not bad. The roast duck and baked salmon were good. Dessert wise was average. Didn‚Äôt try the fondue as it was strawberry flavoured chocolate rather than the usual milk chocolate. Ice cream selection was great. For the price, I think there are better buffets to go to ;)
3
This place can overlook mbs area n sea... but when we booked is Thai delights, don't really like it. But the lobster is very fresh n crunchy. We all loved the lobster
4
For the price that I paid, I was expecting oysters, but nope, they weren‚Äôt available. Though there was unlimited supply of prawns, crayfish, and Boston lobster claws, it doesn‚Äôt entice someone who‚Äôs allergic to crustaceans. The spread was ok, with a little Indian food, Thai food, the usual salads, ham and beef, cheese and dessert. View was good if you are seated by the window, but it can get very warm even after 7pm. My partner and I were perspiring throughout the dinner. The place was quite packed hence we did not ask for another table at a cooler table.
3
Restaurant surrounding view was fantastic. Beautiful.But for food wise, not impressive at all. Not even a dish will make you to go for second round. Variety not impressive.
5
Went for dinner with a group of friends and was impressed by the variety of food and the ambience of the restaurant. The staff were attentive and refilled our glasses promptly as well as clear our used plates. I would like to commend a server by the name of Husni for his friendliness and good customer service. There‚Äôs a variety of seafood like lobster, crayfish, prawns and salmon sashimi. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.
5
I was served by a friendly staff, Husni, who has made my dining experience extremely enjoyable. The food served is very nice. It is a restaurant I would highly recommend to my friends
2
Our family decided to have a leisurely Sunday lunch here. The buffet spread was good and the view was really nice. However, service standards need improving especially as this is a Westin Hotel. Staff behind food stations were not friendly or interested to even respond when we greeted them. My daughter politely asked if there were anymore kiwi fruit slices, the staff‚Äôs response - ‚Äú if you want, you have to cut it yourself‚Äù. Service staff all looked stressed and impatient, I had to get my own clean cutlery. It was impossible to get some eye contact, mush less a smile. Overall, not a good experience
4
Scenery was spectacular... However the choice of food is limited and taste average. Was seated at the corner with near window it was pretty warm. The staff is friendly but not paying attention to details. Glass of water was not refilled until upon prompting. Staff is more interested to promote the spg membership until forget about the arrangement tat i had plan. It was my gf birthday and i had arrange for a cake for her however we waited for the staff to bring over however it never happen until i approached the staff and mentioned that oh ya! Anyway overall experience was oka
4
First time visit to this restaurant, a view to kill for. Food was fresh especially the sashimi and lobster, love the dessert station. I would prefer the afternoon high tea due to the vast blue ocean view, at night u can only enjoy the city skyline views.
5
Wide selection of food. Service staff is very attentive and friendly especially Nui. Ambience good for gatherings. Changes theme and menu periodically. Good value for money
5
Great 6 star service and excellent ambiance!!! Great food and good for families!!! Will highly recommend to all my friends üòÅüòÅüòÅ
5
The restaurant has a nice view with cosy setting. It has great variety and are all yummy. The service by the staff is also very fast and prompt.
5
Excellent service. Seafood is fresh. Food is good especially the pumpkin soup. Nice setting with good view from the restaurant.
5
The restaurant has a very fantestic view, the setting here is comfortable, cosy but spacious. Suitable for families, large group of friends & company gathering. The food has great variety and are all yummy, especially the roast beef
5
Overall my experience at seasonal taste is wonderful. Service here and food here is excellent. Would recommend people to come and would like to come back here again
5
I love the food and there is a huge variety to choose from. The lobsters, prawns are very fresh so are the sushis. The pumpkin soup is delicious too and i love the ambience. I spent a great time with my family here.
5
The view very nice and the food is amazing. I love the ambience of the place. Definitely will be back again
5
The restaurant has a very good view and the setting is comfortable and spacious. Suitable for large families or big group of friends. The food has very good variety and are all yummy, especially the pumpkin soup!
5
Fantastic view on the thirty second floor. We can see the skyscrapers surrounding us and the vast shore line and sentosa cove. It makes you feel like you're eating among the clouds. Fantastic seafood and authentic thai food. Wide variety of food as wel
3
It was first time to visit this restaurant. My family enjoyed nice view from 32nd floor. Nice ocean view till sunset. Nice Singapore eye view after sunset. We also enjoyed Thai mix food with other sea food. One missing was there was no oyster. It was worthy with 1 for 1 voucher.
5
Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of our family during our visit to the Seasonal Taste .The Assistance Manager (Nui) and her staff were so very accommodating and informed about our special dietary needs. The food at Seasonal Tastes was always delicious!
4
Had a good dinner here. Music was a little too loud. Food variety is not the widest, but ingredients were fresh. Good dessert spread. Attentive staff- but they kept taking away cutlery
4
Overall variety and quality is good. One particular dish is the beef noodle soup which makes me feel like I'm back in thailand
5
The four of us went for their Monday lunch and the best thing about the buffet is the location, view, and the excellent cooked food! Of course there were raw seafood, salmon, sushi but they are not as outstanding as the asian delights and DIY-pasta section
4
avocado and blood orange ice cream is very special but not as nice as expected, chargable parking is minus poin
4
I personally find it a tad too expensive for the variety of the food. But this one for one is worth it.
4
The highlights were the seafood, especially the lobster and prawns . The hot section was also delicious . Only downside is that on the 2 occasions of eating here, they did not serve oysters
4
Wide spread of dessert and nice view. Kind of sad that there is no oyster on weekdays dinner. Variety of fod not much. The hokkien mee is eceptionally nice. The waiter was friendly and attentive
4
The view is fantastic, the seafood is fresh. The service is good. Will go for the buffeut with friends n family. If fruit juice were inclusive that will be excellent.
5
We enjoyed dinner here on Christmas Day. The quality and variety of food was amazing. The staff were very attentive and the place spotless. The seafood selection was huge and very fresh. Dessert was Christmas themed and delicious. Lovely special night
4
cosy and awesome views at the restaurant, especially if you get the window seats. Food selection is okie, not a wide variety though. service was moderate only.
4
Selection of sushi & sashimi were ok.Smoked salmon was good and the cold section could be a dream come true for lobster lovers! A pile was available. Warm food included beef, pork and a small selection of pasta.There is something for everyone. Ideal for groups with different tastes.Ambience was ok which could be better if there was a view looking out of the window. We werent given one, even though there was one available till the end of our dinner
5
Make the reservation through Chope and got a 1 for 1 dinner buffet offer. The restaurant is on the 32nd floor and the view from there is very nice. Spread of the food is very good with a lot of seafood items, which are my favorite. There are also a lot of local dishes and dim sum available, not forgetting the dessert corner with special ice cream flavours to choose from. Overall, enjoy the food and the ambience of the restaurant very much. Will be back for more
4
Overall it was a good experience and food standard was as expected. Staffs were friendly to assist to any enquirie
5
First dining experience at Seasonal taste, i was not disappointed. Came upon the uob UOB cardholders promo, be the first 100 diners daily to enjoy an exclusive 1-for-1 dinner buffet all the way 30 december 2017. After gst & taxes, each around $52. Made my reservation thru chope, i was usher with my friends to a cosy window table. The view was amazing. Spread was fantastic during my di ner tht night. There were crayfish, lobsters, cold mud crabs, smoked salmon, baked salmon, pumpkin soup, salted vegetable duck soup, laksa, hokkien mee, chicken Broth, salad bar, dessert booth, etc. The hokkien was so good, I had repeated serving of it. Seafood was fresh and the staff replenished the food quickly once its running low. Staff were polite and attentive. I like seasonal taste as the place is spacious and not too crowded like some other hotel buffet. Dessert booth was so gooddddd. The avocado ice cream was super yummy. I had double serving of it. Dinner was really good and worth it.
4
overall was quite good except the tea and coffee. coffee machine and tea dispenser. considering the number of feasts i had in hotels, i could not accept this. tea was quite bland too. desserts had quite a range, the lobsters hill on ice was also something i first time see and tasted better than some other hotels. not too tough yet chewy. the roast beef (carving) was very well doneness. hence very dry. restaurant being situated at a considerable high level where you can see bird eye vie
1
Had their dinner buffet on Dec 9. Very limited food selection with sub standard quality. Not worth it even with 1-1 promo. Use this money on other restaurants instead
3
Seasonal Tastes is located on the 32nd level of The Westin, Singapore so diners are bound to get a good view all round while dining at the restaurant. Other than that, there really isn't any exciting dishes, and the food experience was just standard fare. It can get warm if you sit by the window and the staff can't do anything about the air-conditioning. Further, they do not offer complimentary car parking
4
Nice place for brunch with family! Wide variety of food and comfortable environment. Service was acceptable
5
1-for-1 Chope Voucher makes it a very good deal. Buffet spread was quite decent. The roasted meat and duck were tasty but the texture was quite hard, had to dip with the sauce. Salad counter was good! For a chicken lover like me, I was quite surprised that there were not much chicken dishes given that chicken meat should be a basic necessity. Crayfish and lobsters were plentiful though. For the canto dishes, kai lan and the double boiled soup were heavenly. The best counter for us would be the desserts counter, with alot of ice cream gelato flavours and toppings, together with the chocolate fondue! Service is top notch, with plates cleared promptly and the Thai manager made our dining experience a good one! She remembered my request for the seats near the windows with my bae =
5
The seafood spread was good, too bad no oyster. Grab the one for one promotion at $88++ totally worth it.
2
Was having 1 For 1 Promotion Dinner for 20pax, but end of the dinner while we are leaving as its closing, was asked to produce the voucher which was given to the staff upon entering the restaurant. Worst thing is make us wait at least 20mins Make us feel very lousy. Normally for restaurant when come to closing will definitely do a check on the billing matter. Not when the guests leaving then ask. Never expect such a unpleasant surprise from a well-known restaurant.
3
I would rate this as ordinary buffet. Staff wasn't really helpful over the phone and ice-cream auntie also looked reluctant in serving the gelato. No smiles at all and rather intimidating. Come on, we paid 32++. We all conclude we will not go agai
3
Although I increased my reservation that morning and got an email confirmation- their system showed the old booking number and the server who showed us to the table didn‚Äôt look pleased. I can understand it‚Äôs busy being full house but little facial expressions showing displeasure is not professional. Also I stated in the booking that it was a birthday celebration, twice confirming over the phone that morning and again when I was seated - but it was forgotten completely. The staff even said I should have reminded him again (???) still overall a decent place to visit for good views.
4
Provides a good variety of food. Ambient was also excellent qnd provides good views of the marina area. The waiters were also prompt in service
5
Food was excellent as usual. The staff were very kind to surprise my daughter with a birthday cake. Their thoughtfulness was much appreciated
5
Altot variety is not a lot but they serve good food. More than enu to eat. Would love to see more cooked food. Staff there is super nice despite I can't find my cope voucher, they still let me in, take time to find it while I am having dinner
5
I had a great experience at Seasonal Tastes the food was good, the staff were polite and very helpful. The pasta, Satay,  cheesecake, laksa and the cold seafood selection were my favorite dishes I would highly recommend it for dinner.
5
Today i went to dinner with my friends. Food was so nice. Seafood also all fresh! I also thanks to manager nui and staff husni, winson. They were give us good hospitality
5
The buffets in this restaurant were extensive. Most of the food was very flavorful. The lunch time buffet was very busy and items were being replaced regularly.
5
It was a romantic and serene night, having dinner on a Saturday, overlooking the highway and over the cloudy skies on a raining night. What more can you ask for?
5
I went over for an anniversary meal and purchased a Chope diner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s choice set. It was really worth the money and the spread was more than enough for my Wife and me
5
Nice foods and best view. All foods are delicious. We enjoyed our celebration.Especially lobsters are fresh and good taste
4
Had breakfast and late night dessert here last weekend with family and friends.It does have a great spread/selection of choices. The food was decent. Price was reasonable with nice views. The only problem I had with this place was its generic. Nothing really stood out. Nothing special about it. It served your typical generic hotel buffet choices. The dessert/a la carte menu were generous portions and reasonable price. But once again nothing stood out and made this restaurant unique compared to other hotels. Service - super slow, need to keep asking them to take plates away. Its almost like the waiters try to avoid coming to tables to help or only help tables with 2 diners (less work) Lots of potential this place. Just need to fine tune the service aspect to be more attentive and make a unique dish/offer that other hotel buffets dont have so more ppl are willing to come into the CBD area to ea
5
The lunch buffet is value for money at $32+++/pax. Food is above average. Ambience is good too. Relaxed mode.
5
 I would just like to say a huge thank you to the manager Nui and the staff Megan.....The environment and food are beyond expectation, the staff are polite and nice.The combination of food, environment and staff make the guests comfortable and respected..... 
5
Went for the buffet last weekend and the spread was amazing. Their food was cooked above average and dessert had a wide variety like fondue, chocolates, cakes and ice cream. Look out for the avocado ice cream which was so creamy and tasty! Special thanks to Nui, a very polite and excellent staff. Really happy with her service
4
We had a great time having the dinner buffet here. The spread was alright ; i really love the dessert selections there. They do have the usual sashimi, scallops, noodle section, hot and cold dishes etc. All of it were above average, though nothing out of ordinary. Still, it is worth it if you can ' eat till you drop'
4
Good experience, friendly and helpful stuffs. Nice and beautiful scenery and view the Singapore flyer.
5
Had my simple ROM ceremony at seasonal taste followed by buffet spread for my relatives. The staff in seasonal taste were so kind to us by helping us to pre-arrange tables accordingly to our request. And has provided us a table to conduct our soleminzation. Overall service was prompt, attentive, and always smiling. Would like to specially mention Husni Zaini, who has been really kind to assist us throughout the event. Had some table re-arrangement and he has quickly helped us to settle it. At the same time, he was always alert and looked out for other guests needs and assist them. Overall, with the spread of food, attentive service and reasonable price during certain promotion, this place is really idea to hold a family gathering
5
Our favourite buffet in town. No oysters but that's a small quibble. Great views of CBD n Marina Bay to boot
4
we went there for Sunday lunch. Pleasant and spacious restaurant. Limited selection but good enough for a full and yummy meal. There were oysters, lobsters, prawns, mussels (?), salmon sashimi (only), soup, pasta and satay and other cooked food section plus dessert selection of courseI liked the double boiled pork soup, Hokkien mee and lobster bestDespite the small selection, we really enjoyed the lunch because it wasn't noisy and there were good views and wide walk way.With DBS promotion we paid $48++ per pax. Just imagine a Sunday brunch with that price
4
A wonderful place to have your favourite food and chill out with family or friends. Delicious food and friendly staff. Simply love the view from level 32. Thumbs up
3
Nice view of the city. Service was good. Server was attentive and prompt to clear the plates. Food however was average at best
3
Food variety too less. Cold seafood not so fresh. Nice view if you are sitting near glass panels. 1 for 1 for dinner is still good deal
1
called and booked for table for 18 pax for their UOB 1 for 1 and got rejected. Reason being is that they only allowed max 10 pax per booking. Therefore, I told them spilt into 2 booking since we have other friend who have UOB card. But then the caller say they are full booked for UOB 1 for 1? if only I can roll my eye and on the floor in front of them, I will do so
4
Service was good and the staffs are attentive to the guests. If it will be good if there is more varieties of food
5
We went here for the lunch buffet and it was amazing the food there is just magnificent really would recommend the seafood and pasta section. Recommended for lunch buffet.(amazing view too
5
Was there for Sunday buffet dinner and the spread was incredible: lobsters, crab claws... love the laksa (add the lobster claws...Yummy!)Service was excellent too and it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t super crowded. Great view too
5
This is the first time having lunch with my overseas friends in Westin Hotel Seasonal Taste. The food there was good many of choice and the staff so friendly...The assistance managers Nui so impress by my Taiwanese friend for preparing a nice birthday0 cake her... thank you Miss Nui,Sornam and her fantastic team so much for sing a birthday song to my frien
4
Recommended for buffet spot and please request for a table with a view. You may not see a super big spread all over the restaurant but they are decent enough for you to have salad, chilled seafood like fresh prawns, lobster, crab etc (plus point as they have condiments available), roast items and nice dessert bar! The restaurant manager is so kind to accommodate my request of a piece of birthday cake for a little surprise. The birthday cake wow us all as the cake taste really good (who'd expect a piece of free cake could taste so gooood!) All in all we are satisfied with the dinner experience but one thing to note: the Cantonese delight is quite salty
4
nice atmosphere, food consider ok especially the cold prawns and lobster. however some dishes under catonese delights are salty. no free soft drinks/juice. only complimentary coffee/tea
5
The food are delicious, there are variety choices of foods over here. Located at level 32 with stunning view. A bit sad as the view was block by some of the building
4
They had a medium range varieties of food, and their pink chocolate fondue is very nice. Price-wise, it would be worthy to go when there is a 1-for-1 promotion
3
it is very disappointing to find out that my booking through Chope to get 1 for 1 promotion was not recognised at all in their system so i had to pay accordingly. i wouldn't buy such promotion through third party anymore
4
We were there mainly for the lobster but the quality was average. Apart from that other food items were not too bad. Dessert spread was not that fantastic either. Been here a few times.. guess its time to explore somewhere else for better quality lobsters
4
I was pleasantly surprised with the wide spread of food for the buffet dinner. The quality is good and the service is fantastic. If you like desserts, this is the place for you! Good food, good view from the 32th floor hence good value for money
3
View is good. Food quality maintained. Great hangout with my friends. Service was average. Might return
4
The spread was wide. We enjoyed the food except for the desserts which were normal. The sashimi slices were very thin.
3
Seasonal Tastes is located at 32nd floor of Westin Singapore. The thought of dining on 32nd floor: amazing view and yes it does have (only certain tables). Decent buffet spread but lack the "WOW" factor. Cold cuts, salads, seafood (no oysters when I was there), dim sum, sushi, meat (beef was lacking in taste), pasta (aglio olio too dry), local delights (Indian and Chinese food), desserts (ice cream was reasonably good).Would not return for another meal
3
Read about this buffet restaurant and having good review with amazing view I decided to try it with my gf. Book a reservation by phone and requested a window seats but upon my arrival the front desk told me that i did not make any reservation, so she usher me to a table far away from the beautiful glass panel. We started off with the cold dish and appetiser, there were huge selection of hams, cheese and even breads to choose from. Live station of pasta and laksa were also available and the carbonara i had was really delicious. The meat was roast pork for lunch which i feel was a little dry. After which we headed to the dessert station which to our surprise had plenty of selection which includes cakes, fruit tarts, chocolate fondue, fruits, biscuits and even candies. The ice cream was gelato with many topping to choose from.Overall we were disappointed with the tables allocated but the food was still pretty good and there is a promotion of $32 for lunch buffet
4
NIce ambience with above average food. A little pricey though if the 1-for-1 offer was not avaialbl
5
This is the first time I came for this buffet on 32nd floor of this new hotel. Like it instantly, especially the fresh lobsters, prawns and sashimi. It would be more complete if there is oyster in their seafood selection:) highly recommended
5
Clean restaurant with nice ambience and view and it has a wide variety of food. The seafood is very fresh too! All the staff are friendly, attentive and prompt in responding to us.
5
Good Service with friendly stuff with Quality food. Nice place for organise meet up with friend and family
5
This is my 1st dinning in this place, the buffet varieties is alot, the seafood is very fresh, staff is very helpful and friendly. Its a best place for buffet lover like us! Will definitely visit again!
5
Great environment, clean, great food display, excellent food mutton soup, lobster , service is good.
5
Was intro by my friend that the buffet is very nice hence decided to drop by since there is a 1 for 1 UOB buffet dinning. Food is very nice, varieties is alot. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The scenery is so beautiful too! Will visit here again!
5
Seasonal Tastes was a delight for all the senses. Great variety of food selection as a fresh and tasty roast meat section coupled with a wonderful birds eye view of the Singapore city skyline made this dinner an unforgettable on
5
Best food and dessert buffet spread in Singapore where I have ever come across. Even way better than Carousel and Melts Cafe.
3
I came to the Seasonal Tastes with pretty high expectations because it is part of The Westin's establishment, but the buffet was average. The Good:1) If you are a cheese fiend like me, the smorgasbord of cheese and pastrami and smatterings of sides would leave you tingling with excitement. Pickled eggs, roasted almonds, olives, pickled artichokes, toasted walnuts, candied peaches.. the list goes on! The cheeses were laid out ever so daintily on wooden boards, and you would be tempted to slather them on the crackers or the baked bread station that stood beside the cheese selections. And a cold bowl of individually packed french butter as an alternative spread? Yes please!2) the salad station had a good 8 choices of salad dressing, with another 3 additional alternatives of handmade hummus and yogurt dressing. I have had my fair share of buffets in hotels, and I absolutely appreciate the effort of the kitchen making hummus and yogurt dressings from scratch, because it does taste vastly different. 3) the dessert counter that was manned by the sweetest middle aged lady had a gorgeous selection of sweet treats. From to-die-for cheesecake and the novel avocado gelato flavour( which tasted great after much promotion from her), there were also little boxes of chocolates and pralines which were divine. The dessert counter may appear seemingly small, but everything that was offered hit the jackpot. I usually abstain from sweet treats but the goodies on display proved resistance was futile. 4) the seafood choices were few, but the crowning glory would be the mountain of shellfish that were gloriously stacked high, and replenished quickly too. The salmon sashimi (only sashimi selection) was also refilled swiftly.The Cons: 1) the restaurant was dim. Way too dim in certain areas to want to consider it as romantic. 2) the cooked food stations seemed a less than stellar, in my opinion. It was underwhelming. 3) my request for a window seat was met, but came with a huge caveat; it was the view of the building on the opposite. So, if you do not wish to be left dumbfounded like how I was, be highly specific in your request. Request for a window seat with AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THE SEA, to be precise. The servers were attentive and quick on their feet. I also had lovely, small chats with the chefs on frontline duty that evening, all of them had such cheery dispositions; that was one of the highlights of my dining experience.No complimentary parking coupon
4
Great environment, clean, great food display, excellent mutton soup, lobster , service could be better.
4
 Had a wonderful lunch buffet with a group of friends at the Seasonal Taste Restaurant. View from where we sat was unblocked and beautiful, looking out into the Sea (depending on your table seating). Would be good to request for tables with a view when you make a booking.Food options were pretty extensive and loved the local options (Satay, laksa, hokkien Mee, chicken rice...) the local kueh kueh was also delicious, and for desserts - the must try would be the Dark Chocolate Gelato!Really appreciated the service - everyone was friendly, kind and professional. As it was one of my girlfriend's birthday, they specially made a slice of Cheese cake with rainbow sprinkles for her - we appreciated the gesture!I will definitely return again, thank you to the team for a lovely Saturday afternoon! :-)

This was our first time having a family lunch buffet at seasonal tastes Westin Singapore and we were impressed from the onset. We were shown to our table at the corner of the restaurant which was rather private and had a wonderful view of the cruise terminal and open sea. Though we were a little far away from the buffet area, we were happy that the area was quiet, spacious and accorded us 'privacy'. Restaurant supervisor, Nui Paphatchon, was simply delightful and made us feel very well-looked after. She made effort to have personal interaction with guests from each table and at the end of our meal, tended to each table one at a time. Staff were always on their feet and food was replenished rather quickly. They all looked a bit harried and after reading some of the reviews posted here, I felt a little perturbed that they were not given due recognition. The level of service that the crew offered this afternoon was definitely above-average. Our dishes were cleared promptly and glasses filled at adequate intervals. Despite not having the variety that some hotel buffets offer, Seasonal Tastes made this up with the quality and availability of allergen free food options. My children have food allergies and often, having meals at buffet can be limited despite the dizzying variety. I was honestly pleasantly surprised that they even offered gluten & dairy-free bread during our lunch today. The oysters and sashimi were very hygienically prepared and served (temperature of preparation area was kept cold and clean). I loved the creamy cauliflower soup and the duck ragout was exceptional. The dessert area offered selections that could not be found elsewhere - avocado gelato, white chocolate with cranberries and pistachios, pear cake - not too cloyingly sweet yet could satisfy the sweet-tooth in me. All-in-all, this is a good place to have a family birthday celebration luncheon or some couple-time for lunch. I noticed that there was effort in placing families with little children together in one area separate from the couples and larger family groups. Personally, I appreciated this a lot as this was something other buffet restaurants have not done (at least, the ones I have visited and there have been quite a number!). Seasonal tastes ranks highly in our list of buffets to visit for now.

Been visiting almost every month for a year until the 1-for-1 deal in around June. Some minor tweaks have been made since our last visit in May, e.g. self-service coffee and tea, slightly smaller portions although selection is about the same, a mountain of lobsters albeit with little taste, and the absence of oysters which was a pity. Service was swift and attentive as usual. The manager, Nui Paphathon was particularly friendly, she personally brought us hot tea when I told her the self-service tea had gone cold. Nice touch. She also told us about the upcoming UOB card promotion. Would recommend this buffet if you want to have a quiet talk, a good ambience and wide enough selection for most appetites
5
The staffs service is very good and food range has room for improvement preferably with fresh oysters
5
It's not very crowded and the food selection is quite good! Love the fresh seafood and laksa!My Favourite would be the avocado gelato! The one for one promo is very worth it :
4
Nice view on 32nd floor and great service from their staffs. Attend to last minute request and arrange a nice birthday cake for us. Good range of seafood. Not too crowded too.
2
Went with the DBS/POSB promotion for a one-for-one weekend dinner. the selection was poor, the quality was poor, service was mediocre. nothing to rave about. the good thing is that it was not crowded at all
2
I booked a table for 10 for a birthday celebration as I heard good reviews of this buffet. Most of us had agreed the food was not as good as we thought. The seafood was not fresh and the beef and chicken were too rare. So one of my friends decided to request the chef to make the meat medium well. After other guests heard my friend's request, they followed as well and chef was seen not really happy about the situation. However, the local dishes like satays, chili crabs and hokkien mee and desserts especially the jackfruit vermicelli were really tastyThe staff were quick in clearing the plates after we finished each serving. They are willing to refill the water quickly. I left a birthday cake with one of the staff before the buffet dinner and at the end of the dinner, I requested for the birthday cake from the staff. I assumed that the staff will prepare the cake with lighted candles as I always did in the past in other restaurants but I was very surprised that she literally brought out the cake as how I had gave it to her initially. This is the first time I had experienced and I guess I was the one who did not give instructions clearly to the staff. I think the worst event I had that made me want to write this review is when I walked to the counter to ask for the bill. There was no one at the counter and so I called out a staff who walked by. She replied, "I am not in charge of the bill. Look for the person with the badge." and she walked away. I was speechless. This made me very upset about the whole experience at the restaurant. So she expected me to find the staff with the badge myself? After the dinner, I sat by at the lobby with my group of friends and had eventually all agreed that we will not recommend and come by this restaurant anymore

Reserved a table by the window, great view towards the cruise centre. Food selection can be wider. Service is great
4
Brought along my 2 kids and hubs to try out this new place and we fell in love with the ambiance the soft lighting bring. Variety can be improved and I was disappointed that there were no oysters served. The desserts however saved the day, particularly love the Black Forest Cake and Avocado gelato.Worth it if it's 1 for 1 promo which they have now
3
Service staffs are prompt, friendly & warm. But feel that the food varieties & quality not worth the $88++ per pax price tag. Some example will be for cold seafood wise only the cold lobster are consider more expensive seafood & there's no oyster. Warm food wise nothing spectacular to worth the price. Fruits varieties also quite bad as there's only watermelon, melon & pineapple which are all consider low price fruit, not even some strawberries. And coffee/tea are worst with 2 large pots of ready brewed coffee & tea and presentation like those cheapo catering. The only good points are the staff & view
4
Nice buffet selections; had a wide array of mains and desserts. As I was seated near the window, I could enjoy the sunset view at level 32 of Asia Square Tower 1
4
Overall food quality was ok.My main purpose of revisting Seasonal Taste is because I miss the roasted pork I ate 3months ago- they were so crispy, well flavored n yet, still melts in your mouth.Too bad the standard n taste is no longer there
4
 Nice Ambient, good food, value for money, beside without oyster, cappuccino machine on and off give problems, insufficient milk.buffet lunch on Saturday if can have 1 for 1 promotion that will be better. Sure support regularly
5
had a nice table view overlooking the southern eastern side of singapore. service by staff is also great. quite a number of ppl on a thursday night as they are running 1-1 promo i guess. crayfish was a bit less averageas could taste a bit not so fresh... but the crab claws were excellent and sweet and fresh. the chilli crab sauce was too sour to my liking. would still recommend to come as overall the food is still fresh and above average
4
Nice setting. Nice view. Just that very lil seafoods served. More on cooked items. Laksa is best! Nice and beautiful scenery
5
Seafood lovers would love the wide variety of choices such as crabs, lobsters and even prawns! The Hokkien Mee and the Chili crab is their best sellers. Not to forget attentive and friendly staff to sum up the dinner buffet experience
3
Buffet dinner food variety is good and tasty. Environment is nice for gathering with family and friends
5
Fantastic breakfast, in style and with an impressive view over the harbour. I liked the fresh juice corner, and the ability given to guests to mix. Sitting is stylish and confortable. All stations are well presented and constantly refilled. Enjoyed thoroughly.
5
Celebrated my bdae 2 weeks ago here n was my first visit...nice ambience n food was good....service crew are very friendly and approachable...didn't !manage to have a table with view but overall we feel its nice place for family bonding or friends get together to chill out n relax... Will be bringing my in laws to try on 12 Aug n have requested for corner table view the nice view of Singapore at night n hopefully will be able to get the table as they r running almost full house over the weekend....Strongly recommende

Went to the restaurant with 2 young children on Sunday lunch.1) What I like: Great view. Good promotion with credit card. Affordable price as compared to other Sunday buffets in Singapore. Oysters bar with oysters being shucked constantly. Cold cuts, cheese and salad spread is good. Not the run-of-the-mill selection. Dessert selection looks nice and taste nice (except cheesecake which is not quite up-to-mark).2) What I like so-so: Attentive but service without real warmth (except 1 or 2 service staffs), Kid's corner looks attractive at first glance but not really practical because there is no space to decorate cupcakes properly. It's also not a real playing corner as there is no toy and no real space to linger around. Only 1 kind of oyster offered.3) What I don't like: 90% of cooked meat and seafood are overdone, with toughness of meat being the underlying theme. Indian selection seemed appetising at first glance but truly a world apart from real Indian food at Little India Singapore. Singaporean food is again quite a world apart from the real deal. Coffee machine instead of real barista type of coffee. No complimentary parking. Conclusion: My tummy was not very well for the entire day after that. I suspect it's the oysters playing tricks

Love the seafood buffet with a view of the Marina south pier.The service staff are very friendly and provides excellent service

We had dinner at Seasonal Tastes at The Westin Singapore to celebrate a birthday. The floor to ceiling glass windows offered a magnificent view of Marina Bay and we were delighted that we were seated at a corner with the view. There were a few birthday celebrations on the evening we were there. For the seafood selection, there is black pepper crab, chilli slipper lobster with chilli crab sauce and mantou, and cold seafood dishes like flower crab and prawns. The black pepper crab and chilli slipper lobster are very nice, except that it gets really messy when eating. The prawns are very fresh, however, we found the crab claws a tad too salty for our liking. There is also a whole baked salmon, roast beef and local favourites like laksa. The laksa is really lemak. For desserts, there is gelato, strawberry fondue and different types of cakes and tartlets. I especially like the avocado gelato. Coffee and tea were served in a dispenser. It would be good if the tea provided were individual tea bags with different types of tea.Service is very good, staffs are attentive and plates were cleared promptly. We were offered a piece of cake with a candle, compliments of the restaurant. As a Starwood Preferred Guest member, there is a 1 for 1 promotion for the buffet dinner. Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner, and thank the staff who sang birthday song when presenting us the birthday cake. We had the best view of Marina Bay too
5
The quality of the food is delicious, It is worth every cent. The ambience and service is top notch
5
The seafood spread was very aplenty, except no oysters, only for Fri and sat. The desserts was very exotic also. Avocado ice cream is a must try item
3
The ambience, location was great. And the pricing was unbeatable. But! The pasta, and several other food items were not really well cooked.
4
We went for a birthday treat last weekend, nice view and food with fair price, this is my second time to visit there
5
Love the wide seafood selection- lobsters, oysters, crabs, prawns... Sashimi... Steak... Laksa... Seafood congee... Great marina view
5
Seasonal Tastes has an incredible buffet with fresh seafood, sushi, meat platters, live pasta cooking station and the most amazing dessert buffet including a chocolate fondue fountain. Their dark chocolate icrecream and avocado icecream are made there and are divine! Totally worth it
4
Highly recommended. Food and service is good.Lots of variety of food. Great place for friends and family gathering
4
Brought the gf here and it was a great experience.! They have attractive lunch dealsand the dinner was amazing. Definitely recommend however I was expecting to have oysters and was sorely disappointment when it turned out there wasn'
4
Location is right in downtown area. However looking for the hotel and the carpark is quite a challenge. Construction work is still around the vicinity. But arriving at the restaurant on the 32nd floor is indeed a pleasant welcome.Service was good eventhough you could see many of the staff are pretty young. The spread at the buffet was good. Overall an enjoyable evening
5
We visited the restaurant for family dinner yesterday. There is a good spread of seafood with lobsters, crabs, prawns, oysters and grilled salmon fish. There are also meat items such as satay, grilled beef and pork, local delights such as laksa, fried prawn mee. The desserts variety are also splendid with sorberts, gelatos, candies, chocolate fondues, fruits, mini cakes and chocolates to choose from! They are having 1 for 1 promotions with various credit cards. Do call them to find out before going. Definitely recommended!
4
Hokkien Mee and pepper crab are the nicest. Desert bar was decent too. Other than that, nothing much to eat.
4
Food selection was varied, with some local as well as European favourites. Staff tried to please with dietary needs. Would have been excellent if their dessert selection had more gluten and dairy free choices
5
Local delights were better than the international cuisines; black pepper crab, laksa and the hokkien mee were superbwish if there were oyster and scallop thoug

On 27th June(Tue), we decided to try the Weekday International Lunch Buffet at Westin Hotel, Seasonal Taste at level 52! The view was fantastic!! It's been a while since we dine in such a height! Their weekday international lunch buffet is so reasonable priced, $32++/pax! They have many many stations, bread, Japanese(sashimi, sushi), Seafood, Dim Sim, Make your own Pasta, Chinese, Indian, Chicken Rice, Laksa, Dessert!!!! More than what we could handle, so we only picked a few stations to try their food.. Sashimi was goood, super fresh and thickly sliced!! Pasta was so so.. There was this Braised Seafood Beehoon is that always almost empty plate pretty much the time when we pass by, finally we tried it and it was YUMMMMMYYY! Super Flavoured, Soft and the seafood sweetness just got so soaked into the Bee Hoon! This explains why it's pretty much empty almost everytime we walk by! Chicken rice was nah... Laksa was good! Dessert corner was a fair bit of big from kueh, cup dessert, jelly, ice cream, biscuit, cakes, sweets and many more.. omg! The dessert corner is huge man.. n I only tried 3 dessert, Avocado Ice Crean, Dark Chocolate Ice cream, marshmallow in chocolate fondue & Banana Coffee Mousse in a cup! I love their Avocado Ice Cream!!! If I've more room I would go for another servings!! Overall, its was a pretty much worth it weekday lunch buffet and I would patronise it again if I could
4
Reservation is easy and fuss-free. Variety of food is just nice. Seafood is fresh but some of the food is rather saltish
2
Was there recently. Average spread with average services. Had expected better from Westin's brand hotel and the price paid. Had credit card promotion for 1 for 1, otherwise it would be totally not worth it.ConsSeems like the staff's service is unable to keep up with the number of customers. Not enough plates, not enough cutleries (e.g. soup spoon, chopsticks for sushi, dessert spoon). Kept asking staff for cutleries. They say will bring it to you, but one of the time they forgot.The meat section was really slow. Sometimes you do not even see staff there to carve out the meat for you. When the food is gone, no one tops it up. The chicken and salmon was usually empty or not carved. Oyster section was empty most of the time, the poor uncle was busy shucking the oysters and customers kept coming, couldn't keep up with the demand. Some of the lobster meat were hard, some food were cold (noodles), the indian/malay curry was not great. ProsNice variety of seafood. Lobster bisque was ok. Laksa, was ok as well.The dessert section was quite ok. Nice scenery.Overall: Wouldn't go back to this place. Not value for money
3
We came for Father's Day lunch which was reasonably priced compared to other more popular and expensive brunch options.While lobsters, shrimps, oysters, crayfish and crabs were abundant, the meat was dry except for the shrimp. The meat choices was also plentiful. The Roast beef was not as juicy as I would like. Hainanese chicken was tender. The Chilli crab sauce for mantou (deep fried sweet bun) was reminiscent of Chilli Grab as I like.I enjoyed the dessert spread. Sorbet was fruity and right sweetness.Not coming back.
5
Fresh cold crab, prawns, slipper lobster, lobster replenished throughout the night. If you are a sashimi lover, then you may be disappointed. The salmon sashimi is not very good. Buffet spread includes laksa, indian food, salads, cheese. The dessert spread is decent. I like that there is a staff there to scoop the ice cream for you.
5
Excellent spread of seafood! Love it! Great service by Nui! I have great time with my colleagues. Love the avocado ice cream too! Awesome!!!!
5
At Seasonal Taste for advanced fathers' day dinner. Seafood was very fresh. My dad loves the fresh oysters and lobsters. Lovely service even as the restaurant is unable to accommodate to our requests. Worthy for 1-for-1 deals. Will be back for second time if the promotion extends
4
Food selection and quality is great. However, the staff attitude when we are late for 25 mins isnt good. Without looking at the reservation, he sternly say the reservation of our seat has been cancelled and the face is quite black
5
So far one of the best hotel restaurant that I've enjoyed going to . Best view when seated by the window seats. Good buffet spread with many varieties that is certainly worth much more than you're paying for. quality of food and service is great. I'll still frequent this venue for buffet. Highly recommended !
5
We visited Seasonal Tastes on Saturday night for a family buffet dinner.The embience is nice. Can have a good view of Marina Bay for those by the full height glass window seatings.We like the lobsters very much. However, diners will have to wait for the oysters as the preparation take some time. The desserts and cakes has alot of varities to choose from.Overall the experience at Seasonal Tastes is good and we are delighted with all the selection of seafood and dessert that are served
4
It was good experience at seasonal taste. We brought 2 kids and the seats was arranged near dessert bar which was good. The Boston lobsters were big and fresh. The atmosphere was good and view was nice. We enjoyed our dinner there
4
Visited Seasonal Taste on a Saturday night to celebrate my boyfriend birthday. Requested for a table with nice view and the manager on duty, Nui, who provided seamless service and went out of her way to accommodate our request. Thanks to Nui, we got to enjoy our dinner with the amazing view and will definitely come back again!
4
The food was good value. The ambience of the hotel and restaurant were very good. It gave great views of its surroundings including the port and the sea. And service was great; Nui and her colleagues made my meal an enjoyable experience
4
Visited on 30th May during lunchtime. The view of the restaurant is facing the seas of the marina, however i sat at the back of the restaurant so I could see the view of mbs as well. The glass is floor to ceiling with westin name on it.Buffet includes 1) 5 types of seafood on ice - crayfish, prawn, clam, mussel, crab2) very huge selection of salad bar(D.I.Y) which is comparable to a salad shop 3) local delights - laksa, chicken rice, hokkien mee, satay 4) others - 5 types of sushi, salmon sashimi, smoked salmon, har gao, sweet sour pork, 3 types of curry, roasted ham. Cooked food selection is pretty limited 5) made to order pasta with 4 types of pasta choice and several toppings and choice of tomato or cream base6) desserts - 5 sherbet including avocado sherbet with several toppings. Nonya kueh, honey financier, chocolates, mini tarts and cakes, also have a white chocolate fondue and fruits.Food taste decent. I do felt that's it value of money for the spread and also for the view from level 32. The customers were mostly businessman. However service was rather slow in term of refilling water and clearing of plates.
5
Professional services from the restaurant, food selection and drinks are good and we will use this place again.
4
Went there for buffet dinner for celebration of occasion. The food presentation is good. I like the gammon ham, duck meat salad and avocado gelato particularly.As the restaurant is on high floor, you have a good view of the surrounding area, such as the Singapore Flyer.Assistant Manager, Nui, is very friendly and helpful too.Intended to go again year-end for Christmas celebration
5
Good view and quality food. Nice environment for family and friends. Good variety and high quality too.
2
Disappointed... They forgot my order for a cup of coffee even though we were just one of the last 2 tables there, I feedback to the cashier and he is kind to offer me a cup to go but I have declined. Another server did not top up hot water for my mother when he refilled our water. Not much choices for dessert, no chocolate cake no chocolate ice cream, no chocolate fondant ( I am a chocolate lover), and the local mini kuek should be steam hot with brown sugar but its cold. Seafood is not fresh too. Wouldn't go bac
4
The seafood was great, the meal will be perfect if they have nicer coffee from coffee machine. But they only had coffee and tea from dispenser.. the cashier also billed us wrongly despite quite a quiet evening with not many customers.. we were using the HSBC 1-1 promo and was charged for 5 person instead of 4.
5
My first time at Seasonal Tastes with the family turned out extremely satisfying. The buffet spread was very good and generous. We were given seats with a great view to go along with our dinner too. Nui and her team ensured that we were comfortable and our needs taken care of promptly. We had a great time and will definitely return for many more buffets with Seasonal Tastes! Keep up the great service Nui and team
5
It was my son's birthday. With a party of 6, Ms Nui gave us the best seating ever. Near the windows with a fantastic view of the Marina Bay area. I mentioned to her it was son's bday and she pleasantly surprised me to offer a cake for the occasion. She was very accomodating and courteous. We had a great evening with delicious food, nice ambience and Ms Nui as a wonderful host. Thank you.Victor Le
4
Nice ambience and good service (Thanks to Nui who made our dining experience a pleasant one). I love the lobsters, oysters, crayfish, prawns, etc. The hot food section can be of better variety. The desserts are great
4
Celebrated our 28th anniversary with my family at Sesonal Tastes. We enjoyed a good view of Marina Bay from the restaurant on level 32. The buffet dinner was decent and of good value with credit card promo. The management even moved some kitchen staff to the restaurant for service of the Wesak Day weekend crowd.
4
I thought all brunch restaurants in Singapore were fully packed. Seasonal Tastes was not. That is good for people who want to avoid crowds. The view from high floor is magnificient.Price: Reasonable. Lobster: Yes. Sushi: Yes. Oysters: Yes. Foie gras: NoThe in comparison best selection was the desert
5
View of the restaurant was awesome. Food spread was amazing. The food was all nicely prepared. Even till end of service, all varieties of food still available. Very recommended place for a sumptuous meal with a view
4
The setting was fantastic, with plenty of space and a decent view from 32 floors up. The spacious room also meant that conversations could be easily held without raising the voice in typical crowded buffet restaurants. While the selection wasn't huge, there was definitely plenty to eat. The standard of the food was just slightly above average
4
Although I didn't get to sit beside the full length glass panel, the ambience was still nice.Seafood were fresh but main course lack variety.While dessert bar have lot of variety.Staffs always served us with a smile, but maybe they were lack of manpower as our glasses were empty most of the time without staff coming to refill
3
Service was good, staffs were polite. Quick in clearing plates but not as quick in filling glasses. The seafood selection such as the slipper lobster and prawns, though fresh, was tasteless. Didn't have the sweet seafood taste. The salmon selection (sashimi, smoked, baked) were excellent! The gelatos were smooth and creamy and an excellent dessert choice. the carrot cake didn't look as appetizing but it was excellent - light and fluffy. one of the most underrated cake
3
Went here for my birthday lunch. Ambience and view are nice. Dining room is spacious. There are only few options from the mains but the good thing is that they are served fresh. I would like to commend the staffs because I saw that they tried their best to give a 5 star service however it was pretty obvious that they are short-handed. It could have been better if there are more staffs on duty especially during full house.Another downside is about the guy who greeted us who can't find my reservation. I needed to show him the confirmation email I got as a proof. After reading few recent reviews, I realized that something must be wrong in their reservation system. I wasn't the only one who experienced the same. I requested for a complimentary birthday cake and a city view but it was unfortunate that nothing was granted
1
Was given table facing the construction side though the restaurant is not full and the manager claim that he is not able to find my reservation
5
Good environment with good food and good service. Value for money. Highly recommended! Already booked a table and coming back 2 weeks late
4
Disappointed with the Chope apps. The restaurant did not had our reservation details as the booking is through Chope. Pls improve
4
There is good location as CDB with seaview and nice atmosphere. Asian food, western food and fresh sea food are combined. Price is reasonable. Not much noise at dinner and lunch time. So there is good for business meeting or converstion with people
4
Good place for family who wish to dine. Food was fresh and offer a wide variety of cuisine. If you are driving be sure to enter from the back of entrance which is the carpark.
4
Good food, good view. Can't ask for more at 1-4-1 but no oysters? If there are oysters when there's no promo, this is wrong. Else, all's well
3
I made a reservation a week before the dinner on 12th Mar and asked for the menu but was told that they do not have a written menu. I requested for 3 small cakes for 3 different family members' birthday, even though it was being agreed but we were given only one small cake on that day. The spread was not fantastic but lobsters and prawns were fresh. The laksa gravy was thick and taste good. We didn't get a good seating view, most of our view were being blocked by tall construction buildings. Waiters were polite even though the restaurant seems to be under staff. It will be great it they could improve their food varieties
3
Even though it's 1 for 1, it still not worth the price! Not much variety. Food not that fantastic.Not easy to find this place too.
4
I had dinner on 1st April 2017, which is my Birthday.The Service staff is courteous. Ambiance is nice. Restaurant is new and spacious. We were given a table next to the window upon requests. The scenery is lovely, able to see Singapore Flyer, part of the view was blocked by the buildings adjacent to it.Food spread is good. I love the cold crabs, the prawns, the fresh oysters and the salmon sashimi. The laksa and herbal chicken soup is tasty. I enjoyed the eveningOne feedback is the Manager has mentioned that he will try to do something when he knew it was my Birthday on 1 April 2017. However, nothing happened even after we have finished our meal. We did not expect anything initially, but not good to mention if nothing is intended. :
5
Value for money as we have the credit card promo, location is good as it is near to the station though the hotel do take a little to get to as it is not easily identified on the ground level (lobby is located on the 32th floor)Great view of the nearby. The service was great with the duty manager helped us to set up the table to have the view of the MBS and Singapore Flyer.Food selection was awesome with fresh seafood, live craving station and noodles bar being the highlight.
5
Food spread was good. The seafood particularly the prawns and oysters were very fresh. The service was prompt too, our empty plates were clear very quickly maybe because it was on a weekday.
4
My 2nd visit here for the buffet dinner.The view was excellent at level 32. Come before the sun sets so you can see dusk and then the lights of the city during nightfall.Variety of food here is lesser compared to the line, melt or edge but the quality makes up for it. The cold seafood was fresh and the crab legs were especially sweet (we had many helpings of it)!Then there was the usual salads, carving station and noodles cooking station (laksa, beef noodles and pasta).Desserts were lovely too (pity there was no crepe/waffle/pancake station). Loved the chocolate mousse cake (the chocolate was rich with a crunchy/crumbly base).Only coffee and tea is included in the buffet price. All other drinks at extra charges.A lovely surprise in the evening was when we exchanged brief greetings with Chef Aaron Foster as he was making his rounds to check on the food at the buffet stations
5
Staff are very friendly and helpful. Value quality is superb. has a good range of seafood that includes lobster, oyster, sashimi, prawns, snow crab and many more. Restaurant has a great view too. Dining is relaxing and fulfilling with superb ambience
3
It's a nice place with limited nice looking food. Especially when I'm vegetarian. It's a try once and will never return place
4
The price is affordable and the place is beautiful. Though the time when i visit, there were a shortage of floor staff but the staffs on hand there make sure that all the customers are well attended to. Will love to go back again if I will to entertain guest on special occasions
4
We have a farewell dinner for our colleague at the Seasonal Tastes restaurant. The food was superb with a decent selection of wines and the dining ambience was excellent, with an fantastic skyline view.There are some minuses though: the staff completely forgotten about the special "treat" that we arranged for our colleague. This lack of attention needs to be addressed as what was promised was not delivered (or remembered) at all. To bring things into perspective, we had similar farewell dinners in other restaurants and every single one of them remembered about the special "treat" for our colleague.From navigation perspective, we could use some signs to draw attention to the restaurant as it was located among the business towers and visitors could be confused on how to get to the restaurant
5
Reserve a table for a two facing the sea.Atmosphere was good and quiet for a Saturday Dinner. Food was good especially for the seafood which are fresh and tasty. Dessert bar (ice cream!) left me with very good impression. Using UOB card will entitled the 2nd person to have 50% discount off! Quite a good deal.

Selected this restaurant over the Chinese New Year to avoid the usual 'shifts' at Chinese restaurants not to mention inflated prices. I have been to the buffet here on a weeknight not long after their opening and was not too impressed. This time, I was quite blown away by their CNY lunch buffet. Not only were there several Chinese dishes including CNY ones, they were delicious and very palatable. The service staff was efficient and pleasant and the asking price of S$55++ just made everything so perfect. My favourites were the roast goose and the kong bak pau. What really stood out was the amount of seafood on offer - crayfish/lobster was offered in multiple dishes...it was unbelievable. All dishes were promptly replenished except I was a bit slow with the dessert so by the time I reached that stage, the macaroons had run out to be replaced by kueh lapis....a small matter as I enjoyed myself thoroughly tucking into the appetisers and mains. If the restaurant maintains this standard post CNY, I will certainly be back again
5
Seasonal Tastes offer a large array and spread of quality seafood and delicious cooked Asian and western style cuisine, for their Sunday Brunch.We thoroughly enjoyed their fresh chilled lobster which you may request their chef to grill instead, if one does not enjoy chilled seafood such as crab too. There is also a selection of raw meats, which can be grilled on request.Their cooked food selection is decent, and they have home made sausages, and a noodle bar for laksa etc.Their dessert spread was also attractive with many cake and cookie offerings, and the ubiquitous ice cream and sobert flavours. Try their unique and refreshing avocado ice cream. It was Halloween time, so some dessets were shaped in cute Halloween designs.Coffee or tea is complimentary, and our Brunch buffet also came with 1 decadent glass of champagne, wine or beer or soft drinks, each.We sat beside their sweeping floor-to-ceiling window, and enjoyed a beautiful view of the sea and Singapore skyline.The Seasonal Tastes was rather quiet in the marina bay financial area on a weekend, so this is the perfect and condusive location for couples and families who want a more exclusive and quieter dining atmosphere, for chilling over a Sunday afternoon from 12pm to 3pm.Service was impeccable.After the satisfying and sumptious buffet brunch, we were treated to a skilled piano player who played many relaxing contemporary and popular tunes, in their beautiful Level 32 hotel lobby.HelenSingapor

I've visited the restaurant many times. There are good spread of foods and with reasonable price. I like the live station and dessert bar at most, the chief cook pasta in front of you, it is very taste. In addition, For SPG member can get 20% off. It's definitely worth the price.

We made a reservation in October 2016 for the Christmas buffet dinner for 3 persons and had requested for a table near the window. The location is within the Marina Bay town centre at Asia Square and away from the shopping district.The food selection was comprehensive; international cuisine with the usual Christmas fare. The buffet was divided into several sections, each catering to the different types of food. Like buffets served by other reputable hotels, the restaurant also offered pasta, noodles and meat fresh from the stove.However, service was disappointing. Firstly, having arrived before our reservation time, we were not given the table by the window as requested. Instead, we were told that there were no such table left. When asked, the wait staff or associate as the restaurant addressed them, informed us that the requested table will only be allocated to diners who made early reservations and not on first-come-first served basis. We explained that our reservation was made about 2 months ago and the associate offered to check with his manager but we were given the poor alternative of a small table instead. We decided to remain at the same table.The table where my husband was seated was not stable and shook when he was cutting his food. The associate helped to clean the spilt water and the manager offered to find us another table. We declined changing our table and suggested the manager place something beneath the table leg so it becomes more stable. The manager gave us the impression that he would assist but did not return after murmuring to the associate that the problem does not lie with the table.Next, when I went to the washroom, the associate thought I was leaving the restaurant without making payment. Whilst I recognise the misunderstanding may have been due to me carrying my handbag, the 2 diners with me were still at the table.Notwithstanding, the same associate probably tried to remedy the situation by his attentiveness. For instance, when getting our orders for coffee and tea, he made the extra effort by going to where I was (at one of the food section) to take my order instead of waiting for my return to the table.Despite the generally positive feedback we have heard about this restaurant and whilst we were satisfied with the buffet spread, the service standards have been found wanting and should be improved. We have been to other Westin hotels for buffets but this restaurant has left a slight bitter taste to our experience
4
Seasonal Tastes offers a wide variety of selections, such as cheese with crackers, salads and customised pasta types (you get to choose the kind of pasta you want and tell the staff how you'd like your pasta to be done). There's also Indian cuisine and dim sum choices (although not many). The dessert selections could have been more, in my opinion. They could perhaps include more macarons selections and fruit cakes (apart from chocolate ones). The ambience is great, giving visitors a splendid view of the city area, if you're near the window.
4
I love this place because its never crowded and its always spotless and service is not too bad too. But I've always felt the food variety is not fantastic for the premium they charge, so as the quality. The view is fantastic though, and I get SPG points for dining here so no complains about that. Short of the usual Westin food standards
5
Had a great anniversary dinner. Food were awesome. Staffs were friendly, especially to Kumar & Bernie. Great job.
4
We organised our daughter's birthday party there. The seafood are very fresh & the staffs' service are excellent, and very attentive. my family are very pleased. even my guests love the food there.
5
The weekday dinner buffet was really nice. Great spread, good service. Food ranging from meats to seafood, crayfish, sashimi, indian, singaporean (laksa) etc. Drinks are separate to the buffet price. They also offer you a 20% discount if you are a Starwood Preferred member. Recommended

Skip the buffet in this otherwise very pleasant hotel. every dish tried had no taste and even left a sour taste that lasted for quite a while after dinner. Most of the food looks good, the choices are numerous but what a let down. The chef needs to go. Don't waste SG$68. Instead run to Tatsu for sushi located in the same building, just next door

SPG members get a 20% discount when dining here there reason we came here to eat. Dined on Saturday lunch with the restaurant only having a few guests. Yes, only about 7 tables were occupied! The spread was very asian with limited number of cuisines in my opinion. There was salad section and live kitchen for satay, pasta and laksa noodle. At one corner are some indian dishes. The dessert section didn't come that attractive as well. Heard they used to have that yard long brownie but sadly it wasn't offered that day. Good the great view saved the seemingly boring experience at Seasonal Taste. Though the price is not that expensive but I really think they should improve

This is our second visit at Seasonal Tastes. Although there are slightly lesser variety then the previous time, we had a pleasant dining experience.The seafood was fresh and there were a good selection of desserts! Must try their chilled prawns, oysters, beef, pan-grilled fish, chocolate tarts and double chocolate brownie.Please give our thanks to Husni Zaini. He was very thoughtful, friendly and attentive. He offered to retake our pictures, ask if we were starwood preferred guest (for the discount) and upon overhearing our conversation, gave us the direction to Raffles Place mrt. Great service! We will be back! :

I came here for a friend's birthday celebration. My first time to come to this restaurant so I was curious of what kind of food they have and how much it would cost me to have a buffet without wine. The food selection isvery minimal. Salad bar doesnt even have enough greens to impress me at all. The food are not that tasty and the service was bad. The staffs were fast to clear away the plates full of untouched food by the time you leave your seat. So, you need to ask your companion to at least watch your plate if ever you are to leave the table . The staffs never ask if you need to have your glasses refilled. You always have to look for them and ask them.Very dissappointed to find this place boring coz it was literally empty. Why ? Food does not taste good and the price was on the high side.I will not recommend this place for a large group of people coz you would surely pay a fortune for a very lousy service and minimal amount of food

We dined here as we were staying at The Westin. Ordered the fresh chicken green mango spring roll (S$14), ham & cheese sammi (S$19), and the nasi goreng (S$18).Prices are higher than usual in a hotel-based restaurant, but the food was fresh and tasty. Nice ambience too
4
This Restaurant has a very good ambience and a nice spread of cuisines. The view is somewhat obstructed due to ongoing constructions, but nevertheless a pleasant sight. The staff were extremely polite and tended to all our needs promptly. The dessert bar gets 5 stars easily! The spread however is woefully limited to Asian cuisines only.
5
National day dinner was at a discount of $51. The waitors were attentive and cleared the tables and topped up water promptly. The spread was incredible. So may things to choose from. However the laksa was disappointing. It was too salty. Overall the local food was average only, except for the fried hokkien mee and claypot fried rice.. The seafood, sashimi and dessert were wonderful. The restaurant was kind to accede to my request for a table overlooking Kallang
1
Tried several local dishes as well as the buffet while staying at the hotel, and found everything to be bland and basically inedible.
4
Recommend to go for dinner for the buffet. It has all kind of food and it is not overpriced. The service is very good and quick. Try the ice creams or the lemon yogurt sorbet!
4
Wonderful spread of food. Food looks of good quality, however a tad salty at times. Many food stations, but unmanned, which is all right for a local as I know how to cook my own noodles and seriously, live stations are a waste of manpower. Dessert station very pretty and great selections. However seems more cream based even for the tiramisu and cheese cake. Needs more fruits to be complete

This restaurant is on the 32nd floor of the WESTIN hotel. I would certainly recommend this restaurant for a leisure lunch or dinner. Unfortunately the buffet was over by 10:30 pm so we ordered from the menu. The non-veg burger was excellent and so was the roast of chicken with jus. The view from the 32nd floor was nice. It was only the service which was a complete let down. In the menu the chicken shows up as grilled, so I asked if the same could be roasted in a pan with the skin and served to me with chopped carrots cooked in butter in a pan.Before I could complete my request I could make out that the waiter was not interested in going that extra mile for me. Its when I said that he should call the chef that he said that he would check with the kitchen if the same was possible. During this period i lost all delight in dinning at the restaurant. I was finally given my dish the way I wanted it. It was very tasty and the portion was respectable. My rating is AVERAGE as I was dissapointed by the service. The bread which arrives before the meal was excellent to. Oh yes I had a mash room soup which was excellent to. The kitchen staff is professional but the restaurant staff needs to be pulled up to serve their guests in a rewarding manner
2
Considering the restaurant being inside the well know hotel but serving a plain food for the buffet lunch was unexpected. Choice was poor and unattractive for the looks then the taste was nowhere near nice so one can forget about a second round. Desserts is also dull. Staffs are busy walking pass by without worrying if any customers would be looking for something! Then chefs at the stalls were unable to communicate in English!

I've been having a lot of misses trying different seafood buffets but Seasonal Tastes has surprised me with their service and good spread. They have a good variety of cold seafood and sashimi and they are constantly replenished to maintain the freshness. The food are nicely lined up, which makes it easy to see what's available at a glance. The meat and fish are prepared on the spot and the live station includes laksa, tom yum and chicken noodle soup.The desserts include both western and nonya pastries, chocolate fondue, fruits, etc. I like the unique ice cream flavours that include blood orange and avocado.Apart from the food, I would say the service and ambience is good. Scenery for the side overlooking Marina is much better as I could only see construction on the other side.The price is slightly towards the high-end but there's 20% discount for SPG members
3
Went to Seasonal Tastes at Westin several times with family and colleagues as our office is in the same building. Lunch and dinner were considered average considering the price we paid. Service level were mostly sub par with exceptionally good ones on a few occasions only. For a 5 star hotel and the price they charge, service should be better and consistent. One of the positive though is that they have an ice cream counter with wide selection and topping.Went there for Chinese New Year reunion dinner twice for the past two years. My family felt that it was very difficult to get service such as refilling water. Food selection was also not as good as the previous year. For tea, were were told that only English breakfast tea. I wonder what is the difference in cost to offer other selection such as camomile tea which they do offer until mid last year.Did a staycation at the hotel Apr 2015 and had breakfast then. For breakfast their selection and quality is in line with other 5 star and SPG hotels that I have been to. I like the waffles that were freshly made.Would I go back again? Yes, with colleagues, for the location. Not for my family as we should be able find somewhere better for the same price range

This is one of the two restaurants located in the Westin Singapore. I had breakfast there each morning. They offer a fairly complete buffet of both Asian and Western foods, as well as the option to order from the menu. The omelet bar is very good. The bacon is cooked just the way I like it: crispy but not burned. There were many choices of fresh fruit and a huge variety of breads and rolls, as well as several fresh fruit juice choices. I ate dinner there two nights. Dinner is also a buffet with the option to order from the menu. In the case of both breakfast and dinner, the menu options are not extensive and the buffet was a better choice. The first night, one of the waiters showed me the various options that were available: soups, salads, pastas, fish, fresh lobster and crab, beef and chicken dishes, breads and potatoes, sushi, desserts, fresh fruit and so on. The dinner that night was good, although somewhat expensive. Coming back from sightseeing late the following night I decided to try the buffet again. It had been good with lots of choices the first night, so it should be the same or similar the second night. The second night, the choices were much more limited. It was Friday night, and as I later learned, it was Fish Friday. I am not a huge fish fan, but enjoyed some lobster and crab and salad. Even the salads were not as extensive (no spinach or fresh lettuce and very different dressings).There were no potato side dishes. There was curry that was spicy and even the desserts were more limited. When I got my bill, it was 20 Singapore Dollars more than the previous night. I asked why and was told it was because it was Fish Friday. I asked why I had not been told. There were some hurried conversations with the manager and I was again told it was Fish Friday. I said it was not right and had I known I would not have chosen to eat there because the meal was not nearly as good as the previous night. Finally, I was offered 10% off the bill. I accepted that, but it was still more expensive and I informed them that I would let Westin management know how disappointed I was. Overall, this experience takes the pleasure and satisfaction out of the Westin experience and I would hope that management would make some changes to this situation

We were pleasantly surprised. Tucked up in the corner of the Westin Hotel, the restaurant had a lovely view and cozy atmosphere. Although the buffet wasn't huge it had plenty of options and the wait staff were attentive and pleasant. We really enjoyed it and there is a discount if you are an SPG member
3
Went on the last day for the Taiwanese buffet and I got to try the giant mochi, bubble tea, fried chicken and some taiwanese specialities. Nonetheless, some items like the stuffed drumstick and oyster omelette which was what I was looking forward to was missing from the buffet line. Staff could have been much more attentive as it was difficult to get their attention and I ordered a bottle of wine which I had to constantly asked for my glass to be refilled
5
We had an amazing sunday brunch there, lobster, oysters, just everything you can imagin and dessert are to die for!!!
5
In some ways a standard buffet breakfast, but it has it all from personalized eggs to pancakes and great fruit. Not cheap though!
4
A very nice restaurant for couples to have meals on Sundays.
The cooking station cook the food on the spots with a wide spread of items. You can have champagne to go along with the meals too. The dessert spread is also good.
5
the breakfast buffet is what you would expect in a 5 star hotel. eggs as you like them, delicious fruit and a great view. i recommend it.

To be honest this is one of the few places that is hard to review. Have some plus points here and low points there but I will just break it to two as these for me are the most important factors - food and service. Food quality in this restaurant is good. Went on a seafood night and I must say I am really contented with the quality of each dish. Although not much of a selection which I don't really mind as I prefer quality over quantity anyway. Then the service. Limited number of staff to the point that i have to look for one several times just to clear my plate. Also have to ask a chef/staff couple of times to refill food which is I think not acceptable especially with the price we are paying. Won't mind going back to eat here but definitely it is not our first choice.

I organised Xmas Dinner for 16 friends last month, Dec 25th 2015. This included free flow Champagne and a turkey buffet dinner. Despite the dining room looking the part, with many well turned out food stations, the food delivered, for the price paid did not live up to our expectations.In addition, there were many features of a turkey Xmas dinner that were surprisingly not available. No stuffing to accompany the turkey, no roast potatoes, no brussel sprouts, and others. The desert station was well decorated, but spartan in respect of Xmas far like Xmas pudding, trifle, mince pies. It was as if the chef had no idea what to put with a turkey, other than rice, which from an established international hotel was a huge disappointment.The food served was at best average, with dishes being short of flavour, in some cases a little dry. The dining room was half empty, possibly a suggestion the Singapore knew something we didn't, as other top hotel restaurants were already fully booked by the end of November.The waiting service was very good, keeping up with drink orders well

The 5 of us spent 12 amazing days in FABULOUS, BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS Singapore - Oh Gosh.. just can't wait till next year.. We all absolutely loved the place..!!We did a lot of eating: and one of those sessions was at SEASONAL TASTES, 32nd Floor, Tower 2, Westin Hotel, Marina Bay.Yes, an ALL YOU CAN EAT Weekend Dinner BUFFET - AND WORTH EVERY CENT - A HIGH QUALITY VENUE offering HIGH QUALITY F & B'S....WE TRULY AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT:- HIGHLIGHT for my teenage sons - The Dessert Station - A self contained carousel counter enclosing staff who served 'all the wonderful sweet stuff' you couldn't really serve yourself with...- HIGHLIGHT for my mother - The View of the bay, and beyond, out the floor to ceiling windows...- HIGHLIGHT for me - Charcuterie; Cold Lobster Tails; Roast TurkeyJUST ONE ONLY NEGATIVE: Definitely not enough staff - We could have spent so much more 'dosh' on Beverages.. if 'some-one' had been around to take the order...!!!##PLEASE.. rectify this before we come again...!!!Visited in December 2015 for Dinner

Seasonal Tastes offers buffet lunch and healthy a la carte lunches with jaw dropping views of the eastern anchorage and the container port in Singapore. We opted for the a la carte menu. Nothing jumped out at either of us as a "must eat" unfortunately. The menu seemed scatter gun and the buffet is a standard Asian five star selection which anyone who has lived here has seen a thousand times (and is done much bigger and better elsewhere)The selection of salads was uninspiring and the portions were small. My friend tailored the salad he had chosen with chicken breast and halloumi on the side, and taking this "build your own" approach was sensible, although the chicken breast portion was very small. I opted for the prawn and fennel and orange salad which was also a tiny portion, so I had a bowl of bland asparagus soup to accompany it. Even the cappuccino to close was served in a small cup. In short we'll be going upstairs to Cook & Brew next time as there is no compelling reason to return - Seasonal Tastes is very dull and lacks a coherent cuisine or philosophy to differentiate i

Bite size vada (Indian snack) was addictive. Seafood including crustaceans was fresh. A wide selection of dipping sauces for the crustaceans and it's a non stop enjoyment.You are spoilt for choices of desserts. Avocado ice cream was my favorite.However, local laksa was underwhelming and needs more taste of dried shrimp.Service was good. When they ran out of laksa and the soup was waiting to boil, they offered to send it to my table.Depends on where you sit, you do get a nice view of the marina bay area but there are also building constructions going on.The name "Seasonal Tastes" is boring and could use a more exciting name
3
Our group of 8 visited the Seasonal Tastes on last Friday to try the seafood dinner.  We enjoy the fresh oysters, sashimi, crabs, prawns. The rest of the food items are just average. Love the choices of ice cream. The only set back is the service. Coffee took a long long time to come and we have to keep asking for it.They should have provided an area for us to self serve the coffee
4
Very good selection of western, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Singaporean food.
Also love their fresh carrot juice and fruits every morning.
Tips: Cappuccino when they ask you for coffee/tea!
2
Had lunch for 40 SGD and was not satisfied at all. I wanted to try the local food and I felt it was taste less. They have to do something to improve the kitchen.
Service was good and friendly !

Food wasnt fantastic and not much selection for the breakfast and buffet seafood dinner. try to go for breakfast early as around 930am it gets crowded and people have to Q to get seated

I had a business meeting with a colleague and 2 clients on 13th October. We arrived @ 7:00am as the clients had another appointment @ 8:30am. Tea/coffee/breakfast was ordered by 7:05am. My tea arrived. It was lukewarm. Our simple breakfast orders were eggs with toast and side dishes of avacado and smoked salmon. The 'toast' arrived first after about 20 minutes but the bread was still soft. Then came the avacado and smoked salmon but after another 5 minutes. 40 minutes (!!) later, our eggs still hadn't arrived. I complained to the manager on duty, who did absolutely nothing nor acknowledged us when we left 15 minutes later (by now we had to wolf down our breakfast). Definitely not the pathetic experience one expects from a quality hotel such as The Westin.
4
Enough food stations to standoff anyone. The cold cuts, salads, oysters, prawns and baby lobsters are great starters. Baked whole salmon, roasted beef and turkey meat are delicious. Japanese sashimi n sushi. Local laksa, noodles and chicken broth soup. And desserts of fruits, gelato and cakes topped off the meal with coffee. Worth the price for meal. Strongly recommend u try it. Make reservations early to avoid disappointment.

We have been there for lunch! Lunch was ok and we got what we expect!But: Officially, they promote 20% discount on the complete bill! However, suddenly that does not count because of e certain reason (in our case: that does not count on Sunday lunch... Reason: it is Sunday ?! What?!)Really said! Of course, in front of my friend I do not want to discuss about that topic. In the T&C it is not mentioned that it does not count on Sunda

I was here for lunch and enjoyed it thoroughly. The variety and spread is not as much as some other buffet restaurants but the great taste of the food and dessert more than makes up for it. There were a few live stations and you can request for the enthusiastic chef to make your favorite pasta with your own ingredients. I had spaghetti with tomato sauce and it is one of the best that I have tasted. The other live stations are the Laksa and the sandwich station where you can pick your own bread and the sandwich artist will make you an awesome and yummy sandwich. Ingredients for the sandwich include great meat such as smoked salmon, turkey ham and even boston lobster meat. Some of the other must try are the mushroom soup and the chocolate & caramel seasalt gelato ice cream. SPG members and Maybank Elite or World Mastercard Cardholders enjoy a 20% discount currently which makes it even more value.It's my first visit here and i kinda like this place. The view is not bad and also the ambience and design of the place makes me feel like I am holidaying in another part of the world. I don't give 5 stars rating for a buffet establishment easily as being a regular hotel buffet foodie, my expectations are higher. But this outlet deserves it for taste, service, quality and price. I will be back again very soon for the dinner
2
Some colleagues & I had the lunch buffet yesterday. We were disappointed with food quality - fresh seafood that was tasteless or tastes dry & have been sitting in fridge too long, pork rib from frozen ribs, asparagus soup was tasteless, dessert mousse was dry instead of creamy & smooth.The salmon sashimi & salted caramel gelato were the only 2 items I liked.So unlikely we will be back for the food.The environment & sea views from the windows were nice. Price was ok
5
I hate buffet's like fat kids hate salad. However, this was really good and I really enjoyed it. A great range of seafood and meat. Excellent salads, sushi and noodle bar. The desserts were a highlight. The view is great and we couldn't fault the service. The price aint cheap but it is better value than comparable buffets in 5 star hotels in Singapore.Highly recommended

My partner celebrated my birthday in the restaurant on 3/5. It was a surprised plan that ended with beautiful memories and a satisfied customer. The variety of food was acceptable with an international fare offered in various cold and hot stations. The overall taste of the food agreed with our palate. We enjoyed the cosy setting of the restaurant using lights that automatically adjusted its intensity from evening to night. The music played in the background was chill out genre that made it appropriate, relaxing and classy for dining. The interactive layout of the open concept food stations was clear with sufficient room to move from one to another. The highlight of the restaurant was the floor-to-ceiling windows that shows off breathtaking views of Singapore's city skyline especially viewing it in the evening from 32nd floor.We appreciated the good service received. Most of the chefs and servers were polite, interactive, friendly and attentive with a smile on their faces. However, the grouchy and impatient female server at the dessert station should reflect and make more efforts to improve her level of service and to better manage her attitude so that it is consistent with her peers in the positive and professional representation of the team and the restaurant.I am thankful that the restaurant has arranged a table by the window for me to enjoy the view while dining with a great companion and being looked after by a team of lovely servers.I would recommend this restaurant for special occasions celebrations and sharing the space and the moment with your loved ones
3
Good view. We liked the fresh carrot, water-melon and sugarcane juices, but food quality is average, vegetables are not fresh.
5
The breakfast buffet was excellent. Plenty of choices, made to order omelettes, etc. Too bad didn't have any seafood choices - other than smoked salmon.
5
Delicious food. Excellent portions. And friendly staff to answer questions and make recommendations. I had the buffalo mozzarella and the chicken and both were delicious.
3
The view is amazing from the top of the Westin Hotel at Seasonal Tastes. Buffet was nice, but not sure I'd put it as the best I've had. Nice seafood selection.
3
Quite pricey. Big buffet, but not the best. Lacked descriptions and selection of meats. Breakfast was ok but also pricey.

It was a fateful Saturday 14 March 2015, where several of my friends had gathered to celebrate two upcoming birthdays of my fellow buddies.The restaurant was situated on the 32nd floor of the Westin Singapore.Upon reaching, the counter staff checked us in to our seats and to our awe, the seats were humongous. When we walked in we were appalled by the selections and the setting of the fare that we would be trying that evening.Service staff was friendly but abeit too prompt as one of the lady staff cleared my plate immediately once i finished my food with a few strands of vegetables left (I was going to finish that!).Nevertheless headsup for the food, the seafood on ice selection was fresh especially the oysters, freshly shucked.I had several pieces of prime ribs brisket thingy and found it not bad as perhaps the doneness was medium?Overall, we had a great time and enjoyed our session especially at the dessert station.Good ambience and food, I will be back to try their fare again

Stayed at Westin on the eve of Valentines Day. We decided to try their breakfast buffet at Seasonal Tastes. The sea view was panoramic. Great way to eat breakfast while chatting with friends. The food selection though was just average for me. It didn't enticed me to get up and try the rest of the dishes. The bacon was a bit salty for my taste. My partner loved the cheese and the pastries. I loved the waffles! It's very crispy, freshly made and very tasty especially when I added the maple syrup and almonds.Breakfast Price: $48 if I remember correctl
5
The only reason why I gave this restaurant 5 stars was the great sea view that few other seafood buffet restaurants could compete with.The range of seafood was rather limited (just a counter). However, be it the oysters, mussels or prawns, the offering was very fresh and succulent.The cooked food segment includes most Asian cuisin (there was a special segment for Indian cuisine). I like to eat fried rice, so I would taste some whenever I could. I could only say the fried rice here is bland. The fried noodles were amazingly tasty (the soup was 'absorbed' into the noodles very well). However, in general, I would say "give this section a miss".The dessert section was up-to-par. There's no oomph, neither is it bad. They do serve gummy bears, though. It was the first time I come across gummy bears in a buffet.In conclusion, the seafood (and the great view) is more than sufficient to make up for the disappointing cooked food section and the not-so-memorable dessert section. Would it be better if they have more seafood options? I can't say. I was already full by gorging on that limited variety. I can't imagine having more to choose from

Had a awesome dinner at the seasonal Taste @ Westin Singapore. Especially like the Harbour View from the table specially arranged by Ms Candy Lee for the kind gesture. Good ambience, excellent food and service in allPrice is also reasonable and a discount of 25% for SPG member and Westin Inspire member.Strongly recommended!Dr E. Cho

We were there on a Friday evening and place was busy but not packed - that's great since noise level was not high. They had a great spread of westin and Asian cuisines, all with the usual trappings. Food quality is reasonable high but not great. My grilled sirloin wasn't tasty and my had had last mee which she rated "averwge" only. On the other hand the cold cuts were nice high quality. On the dessert side, the avocado gelato was just amazing. It's not too sweet and very smooth and creamy. Overall a recommended place for get together with friends.
4
We had one breakfast in the Seasonal Tastes restaurant, which had a wide choice of food, from continental to Asian and the good old full English meal with sausages, eggs, bacon etc ‚Äì and the bacon was beautifully crisp.
3
Love the service and desserts are really nice except the very dry chocolate cake. The food spread is alright and reasonable . Nice quiet place to chill with friends till closing
4
I had a chance to have lunch here twice and the spread was infinite! They cater to all cuisines and there are numerous live counters. Their seafood spread was quite decent. I think the best part of this restaurant on the 33rd floor (of Westin) is the view
2
Headed there for annual dinner with friends as we try new places to eat on special occasions. Decided on westin as we have never been there. I was late while my friends arrived there. There were already complaints when I arrived. Water was replenished but on an individual request basis. When we asked for it, it comes. When clearly all glasses were empty but only the one who asked gotten replenished. Clear sign of lacking in being service orientated. Most counter had no utensils like the laksa counter was always without soup spoons in the 2 times I went over. Each time when we asked for it, had to always wait. The last straw was when my friend asked for milk with her coffee. It never came. Make it an issue to the assistant manager and no apology was given. It was only after speaking to the bartender who my friend asked who was in charge of the restaurant then it was highlighted. A 50% discount was given in the total bill and a bottle of white wine as a service recovery. But I think the experience and the lack luster in the menu is something I will not return. There are truly better buffets in SG like one reviewer claimed. For the label and the organization (Westin) on a whole, is truly disappointing. Hope you guys will source out some improvement for a revisit.

We had a great meal here on a Sunday night. Miguel from Spain met both my Wife and I when we arrived at the hotel separately and was especially gracious and charming, my wife commented when she joined me at the restaurant. Top tier front of house managerial talent.I‚Äôd tried to book a few times and It was actually required for me to book a table a long way in advance, and I‚Äôm not sure if this says the restaurant is popular or my pull is low. We asked for a window as the view is pretty good, and got this confirmed on the day.Food was for the most part pretty good with all but the tom yam and sashimi (salmon was ok) not hitting the mark,though the deserts, oysters and cooked food were pretty awesome. In summary you's really go for the view here and arrive to watch day turn to night for all the ships - go before more building spring up and obscure the view
4
Had Champagne Lunch here with family and new baby. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the lounge area has some great views out over the coast. Everyone is very professional and helpful.The Champagne lunch was delightful with lots of choices, and we wern't rushed at all.To end the meal the deserts are lovely with plenty of choice, too much!!!!A lovely family afternoon spent with great food, in a lovely venue.Have been here before and would definately return!

We had an early Thanksgiving lunch at Seasonal Tastes restaurant. We decided to avail of a credit card promotion which offered a reasonable discount to be used for this restaurant. The buffet was quite extensive but the taste is just average. Nothing noteworthy to talk about. The ambience is normally what customers go for since its on the 32nd floor of the Westin hotel that affords a view of Singapore's skyline. There were a lot of diners when we were there during lunchtime so the buffet at this location is probably popular with the office crowd
4
Went for a Saturday lunch buffet during the first time as I had read good reviews, and subsequently for a weekday lunch.I was really impressed with the views upon entering the restaurant. The selection of buffet was decent, although not as big as one would expect when compared to the other hotel buffet spreads- however this can be expected as the price here is also much lower.There is a salad station on the left near the entrance (it appears to me the selection of dressings is larger during the weekdays tuna weekends). Opposite the salad station is a pre-mixed non alcoholic drinks. After the salad station is the Japanese station. It seems that the sashimi was refilled more often during weekdays than weekends.Nearby is the pasta/noodle station, followed by a few international fare stations. There is a small chinese fare station right at the end and Indian fare station. In front of the Indian fare station is the bread/cheese station. My favorite station is the desert station, which is located near the entrance. There is a chocolate fountain - the first time I went it was a matcha chocolate fountain and the second time was a strawberry chocolate fountain. The selection of deserts include local nonya kuehs as well as cakes and tarts. I also like the selection of ice creams (which varies), there were flavors like coconut, avocado, dark chocolate (heavenly).Sign up for the Starwood card (it's free) for discounts on the buffet price
3
View on 32nd is awesome! If you are not afraid of height, seat next to the window and you can have bird's eye view. Buffet served has a theme. The night we went was Seafood, so you have same type of prawns cooked in different ways like grilled, fried or raw.I won't say food is fantastic. For the amount of money you pay, choose wisely what you eat
3
we went there for brunch.1st the misplaced our reservation so we had no table,but somehow the manager arranged a table in the lounge for us.food selection was fair but far behind other hotels.in general its was ok but far from wow.i will go back to give it a second tr
5
The service is excellent. Views are wonderful. Food is excellent. However, it comes at a price. S$52 for breakfast is a bit steep.
2
have booked a table to celebrated our wedding annicersary, the place is very nice and cosy, but the foods varity is so so, not to my expectation, for the price of S$55.00++, they don't have osyter on ice, i was s dissappointed.
3
The Sunday brunch, The Brunch Beats, is of average food quality. Selections are limited and not much seats. Limited chef specials being dished out as well. Great views at the moment as the surrounding lands have not been developed.
1
Surely the people who think this is a great sunday buffet have never visited any of the other brunch venus in Singapore. Not only does the food selection pale in comparison to everywhere else, it is never replenished during the three hours of service. The lamb leg was reduced to a carcass of bones by 13.10 and never replaced. ( Aside to the chef, when you cook a leg of lamb, save some juices to make a gravy with.) Mutton Curry was good, but again just an empty pan for the last hour of service. 4 choices of cheese do not make a cheese board for a hotel of this standard, I have a bigger selection in my house fridge. Lobsters also thin on the ground and replacements slow in arriving. King crab legs should be split before placing on the buffet. No Sashimi at all, no salmon on the Sushi table, from my experience of Singapore Sunday Brunches, Sashimi and Sushi are among the most popular items. Suggest the Westin Brunch Team, and a few of the reviewers on this site, visit some of the better brunch establishments such as Pan Pacific, St Regis, Fullerton etc, to see just how it should be done

The food here are really delicious. It is definitely worth going for the buffet. Besides, seasonal taste provides a really cozy environment as well as a good view of the whole Marina area. Besides, the team of service staff were really good too. Special Thanks to Husni as well as John Ong for the great hospitality provided

My family and I had the buffet lunch here.We enjoyed the wide array of local cuisine, seafood, fresh sushi and sashimi and Italian food. The Nonya desserts and home made gelato were of very good quality.The serivce here was very professional, prompt, friendly and customer oriented. The wait staff are well trained to give all diners a lovely dinning experience by providing excellent service.The setting and ambience is elegant but yet casual and cosy. Tables are set far apart so there is lots of privacy between tables for long private conversations. The restaurant, situated on the 32nd floor, offers stunning panaromic views of the Marina Bay Area with its floor to ceiling glass walls

Had a team lunch. The views are fantastic. The food is of good quality. However the selection is not as varied compared with others I've sampled. Enjoyed the make your own pasta. Cold seafood is fresh. Service is good and comes with a smile.Would say this is a nice place to chill out

Was in West in Hotel for a one day conference and had lunch here. It's a buffet self service style lunch at 33rd floor ,I think.Vast array of food from tandoori to Chinese,Japanese,local,Western and more. Salad, ice cream, wine, they have it all. Nice decor and long glass windows shows off the surrounding sea and city.Taste 4/5Hygiene 5/5Price4/5Service 4+/

Overall is a great experience!Environment : Very spacious. We had sufficient privacy even though the restaurant had a few big groups of more than 10 person in each table and yet the restaurant does not sound noisy.Food: We felt very pamper! The moment we started with our first course from the buffet line, we were so surprised that Drunken Prawn and Grilled Prawn was served to our table. We love the carvery as well, especially the roast pork!Service: Special thanks to JOHN and his team! Not forgetting Tony and Levelyn,( hope i did not leave out anybody) very friendly and attentive staffs, our empty plates were always cleared promptly!You guys are Super Star :

At $158.00 per person and being the Westin my expectations were high. The venue is gorgeous. The interiors trendy, comfortable. Staff were good but seemed rough around the edges. They need more polish. Food was good but not exceptional. More communication on what is on offer would be appreciated to maximise the experience. Would I go again. Absolutely yes.
