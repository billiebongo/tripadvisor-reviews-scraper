We went for dessert expecting only waffles but it actually has the usual cafe offerings of burgers, fries, etc. for a normal meal. The waffles were very nicely done. We tried 2 flavours, red velvet and the traditional plain one - both were very good. Unfortunately, they had run out on the charcoal one. There were 16 flavours of ice cream. We tried 4 flavours but the durian was our favourite. The salted caramel was disappointing. Each flavour came in a huge scoop (larger than most other waffle places). Worth a visit if you are in the neighbourhood.

Wow! We found this place on line, writing about waffles and ice cream...We went there and ordered a waffle each with ice cream... My tip, either share or dont have any food before you go there..They are huge, freshly prepared and so tasty!best waffles ever, we had the Red Velvet waffle, with fantastic ice cream flavours.We were informed yesterday they will start serving lunch and brunch deals from June onwards. If the waffles are anything to go by, the place will be packed
