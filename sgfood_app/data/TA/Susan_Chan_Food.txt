I always try to grab at least 1 meal at Susan Chans' on my regular trips to Singapore. This is just good wholesome value for money food.

many people go there for lunch for their mixed economy rice. It is kind of expensive but I guess that's not surprising because it is just off Orchard Road. I personally kind of like the prawn paste chicken they have there!

We came by this place by surprise having no idea what to have for dinner until this old lady greeted us by the front entrance of the shop, so we decided to give this a go.The food we ordered was "Tofu HotPlate", "Sweet sour chicken" and some other dishes. The interior of this place is very basic and I can't help but feel at ease with the surroundings - perhaps the Chinese food served are displayed in a very home-style presentations reminiscing of my old childhood times, that's why. The flavor is excellent. Very typical, nothing special, but it has soul to it - a staple "ingredients" that is so, so rare to find nowadays amidst a bustling vibrant city like Singapore. Susan Chan Food is like a hidden gem to me. Truly recommended

OK your in Singapore, don't you really want a great food experience? Well Susan Chan is it, certainly not fancy but you will not be disappointed in the food or the price. Located in the top floor of the Far East Plaza, just off the busy shopping district of Orchard Rd. Great place to get a great meal. This is the kind of place that makes a visit memorable. This is also a great shopping place, have fun, we did
