The cafe is situated not really near from the mrt, however you be surprised there is a crowd at the cafe. Food will pretty okay and atmosphere will soothing
4
Great atmosphere and deco. Lovely place to chill. Just for a coffee. Food is mediocre and overpriced. But understandable due to high copyrights prices
4
Nice and beautiful place for a dinner date. Love the menu and the ambience. The drinks are also very tasty. Will come back again.
3
Not as good as I expected. There are a lot of space to improve. Warm beer was served. Decor was disappointing. VERY COLD inside. BTW steak was not bad.
5
If you’re a fan of Friends TV show, then its a MUST GO place. Veg options are limited but one can have Pizza, coffee and shakes. Geller shake is chocolicious.

We started this cafe hunt recently. Mainly to try the dessert and coffee. We found the dessert easily cost $20 here.

As a F.R.I.E.N.D.S. follower, I booked our table for 8 as early as December 2017 for our visit this week.I’ve been warned that the food is expensive. Trip Advisor warned me that the service is poor and there was nothing special about the food.So stripping it down to the essentials, it was novel to appreciate the sets replica from the TV series.To my relief, the Janice OMG baby back ribs did not disappoint (the compressed fruit mentioned on the menu turned out to be just watermelon and melon cubes which I left untouched).The Rachel Green’s cocktail I ordered was very good.We also had the Ross-ti for appetiser. This I can recommend. The mushroom appetiser, one can skip.Pizzas were good, I’ve been told by our guests. Monica’s vegetarian lasagne was good.Credit goes to the fact that Central Perk catered for my kids’ requests for a cheese and tomato pizza as well as plain pasta with butter and salt on the side. I am thankful that the lady serving us at least came back to our table of what we would be charged for these special requests.Service was - I would expect - as humorously poor as Central Perk’s. It was so hard to get anyone to serve us. I had to get up a few times to get someone to take our main dish orders. The servers did not really seem motivated to keep their clientele which I thought was pretty funny. Maybe if they lowered the menu prices, they would have been more motivated for us to order more food and drinks. Past 9 pm, they were clearing the garbage bags out of the main entrance even if we were still in the cafe.At the end of the day, we did not let the hiccups ruin our visit. I really was there for the Friends’ memorabilia. We had a quiet night catching up with our friends rather than sitting waiting on a queue on a busier establishment or being served in a rowdy bar. Central Perk felt like a neighbourhood cafe. Did I mention that there was the big screen showing Friends’ re-runs? My 10-year old had a crash course on what the TV programme was all about!I got 5$ off our bill but buying a Chope voucher. But that’s it... be prepared to pay lots for the novelty and to see the Asian-version of Phoebe, complete with the ponytail and blue eyeshadow :0)
3
Staff lacked the knowledge of ongoing promotions especially the chope vouchers. They were friendly and accommodating to our huge group of 13 pax. Food was served relatively fast as well. Food was average and more to the higher end except for the Aglio Olio which was tasty. The real deal is the ambiance especially if you are a friends fan like myself. The Foosball machine and the photo props were a plu
1
Crayfish was not well cooked/ still raw at head portion. Portion is small. Was billed twice for item. Explained to staff twice, eventually item was removed from bill. Sofa was main draw at restaurant. We had several customers coming to us to request to take photo with the sofa. Had to remove our belongings so they can take their pic. Very disruptive.
3
Overall themed design and decorations are quite on point. Screen set up to show the TV series’ highlights was unnecessary, and makeshift backdrop put up to block sunshine glare made the place look shabby.Coffee was overly milky, food was average but the staff was friendly. Definitely a place to visit once if you’re looking for good photos or if you’re a fan of the show.
3
Reservation was made and birthday celebration indicated. But table not ready when we arrived. Reason being that someone else has taken our table. Eventually given our table after 20min wait.
4
Though on the pricey side, the food is pretty good and the ambience is wonderful. It helps that we managed to get to sit in THE couch and we simply spent the whole afternoon watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S again!
Would love to do it again!
4
I love watching Friends and spam-watched it so I was very eager to check this place out. They did a very good replica of the movie set and the food was delicious though albeit slow. It was fine because they constantly screened Friends. Must-try would be the candy helium balloons! It was sticky but great fun..
1
We were so excited to go, especially since we are such huge Friends fans, and walking into the restaurant and seeing the "stage" was brilliant. But then the service and food let this restaurant down in a big way. After ordering some tea, we had to get up and go and find some milk and sugar. Every time we wanted something from the waitress we had to go and find her. She, in the meantime, was standing against the bar, watching the re-runs of the show on the big screen!We had to ask them to clear the plates, had to chase up drinks orders, but when we asked for the bill, they were there in a flash! And to top it off, it was wildly expensive! I took great offence that there was a service charge included in the bill, as we had NO service. I would have refused to leave a tip if it was an option. We will most definitely never go back and warn people off. Terrible
5
We stumbled across this restaurant by sheer chance as it was raining, it was across the road from our hotel, Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay and we had just flown in from Australia. It's based on the TV show "Friends" Big screen showing episodes of the show. We had pizza which was quite good. Prices were reasonable. Staff very friendly
4
This cafe is PERFECT for fans of the Friends TV series. The decor in this cafe is really similar to the movie set, not just on the set in the cafeteria, but also the set of Monica's kitchen, chandler and joey apartment backgrounds (complete with dog statues, cabinet sets, billiards), ding dong games, phoebe's creepy artworks, Rachel's wedding dresses, Monica's chef shirts, Ross's dinosaurs fossils Employees are very friendly, do not hesitate to ask for their help to take your photos.The weakness of this cafe is the location is hard to find, because it is in a place that is not crowded and rather remote. When I get there,i have to ask a few people around and not all of them know about this cafe. Please note that the cafe is located in Central Mall not in Clarke Quay Central Mall, because the location of those 2 mall are very close and many people get lost in Clarke Quay Central Mall. The easiest way to get here is to take the MRT and get off to Chinatown then you turn left to Upper Cross Street
4
It's the replica of Central Perk cafe in the FRIENDS series! Awesome ambiences and service where we can re-watch some of FRIENDS series or just chill and relax. The coffee is great and we love the garlicky french fries! We also took picture with the miniature of Monica's kitchen
4
The ambiance is really nice. I loved every moment that I had inside the coffee shop. The food is good too. What could be better is the serving time. We waited for more or less 20 to 30 minutes before our food arrived. Nevertheless, the customer service is more than what is expected. I wish I had more time to spend in the restaurant. If given the chance, I'll definitely be coming back
5
Came here for coffee & a photo opportunity on the replica Friends TV set.If youâ€™re a fan of Friends this is a must visit on the bucket list. Great atmosphere watching reruns of Friends whilst enjoying the TV set & sipping away on a coffee
5
Had dinner with a cousin who is also a fan. They have trivia nights with prizes to be won. There is merchandise shop too. Half section has nice ambience with the legendary central perk stage, the other half looks odd. Joey's meaty pizza was good. Pork ribs too. The only con is you need to walk a distance to get to the cafe from Clarke Quay stn
4
Great atmosphere for a chillax session with friends. Great service from the crew.
Mains are a little pricey.
Coffee served in cute oversized cups, same one used by Ross & gang ;)
4
All the memorabilia from the series, good food and service. Had the phoebe pizza and the joey frappe both of which were really good.
3
Celebrated friend birthday where we ordered pork rib - quite soft and tender, big portion best to share and seafood stew- not much soup and the prawn are overcooked. I like the bread toasted just nice that goes well with stew and mushroom soup!
5
Some interesting food choice. All were good. Except for the Pizza with the biscuit base taking some getting use to.
5
As fans of the TV show FRIENDS (my wife and I are currently re-watching the whole series), it was great to be able to celebrate my birthday at Central Perk. Prior to our meal, we had a ball taking photos on the orange couch and at Monica's kitchen. And we were also pleasantly amazed looking through each of show props on display at the restaurant that we almost forgot we were there to eat. Though there were no performances nor events that night, we still had a great time watching old episodes of the show while dining. Apart from the nostalgia brought about by being fans of the show, our feedback for the restaurant itself is also good. The staff were courteous and friendly and the food was great. A must-try are the Chandler's Thanksgiving Chicken and the Janice's Oh-My-God Baby Back Ribs. Oh, also a must-try are the Flavoured Edible Helium Balloons. They not only taste great but are fun to try as well :
4
We grew up being fans of the FRIENDS series. It’s great being able to walk “on set” and reminisce the good o’ times with hubby. Good, friendly service! A little slow on a lazy Sunday afternoon but that’s no issue, was given a wonderful sofa seat to chillax. Food was average for the price point. We would bring friends back again! Especially friends who also grow up with Rachel, Ross & gang
3
Me and my better half are huge fansof the famous sitcom 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'. Hence this place was a must visit on our Singapore vacation itinerary. The place is well decorated. They have the famous central perk couch and the entrance area where Pheobe performed. Their food is average. They are pricey but that can be understood because they are licensed to use the name. Overall the place is great even if you just want to go grab a coffee.
5
This is the best place to be the FRIENDS geek that you are! I'm a big fan of tv show FRIENDS and I came here only for the photo ops on their FRIENDS props but I'm surprised to find that the foods here are also that good! I had the baby back ribs or as they call it "Janice's OH.MY.GOD Baby Back Ribs" it was so good I forgot the bill was so expensive. They have lots of food choices and these are on big servings so I recommend coming here with FRIENDS. The whole cafe really makes you feel like one of the characters in the show, props are everywhere; Monica's kitchen, Joey and Chandler's room stuff are there you name it! I had the a lot of pictures walking out of here. The cafe also plays FRIENDS episode on the tv. You'll really never get enough of FRIENDS here. I love this place and I totally suggest you make a visit when in Singapore! Tip: don't order lemonade :
5
We stayed at the hotel Just opposite which had very bad coffee so we tried here one morning and so glad we did!The coffee is amazing, lots of different blends and options and the coffee was so creamy we came here 3 times in 5 days away!Maybe a little over average price but it’s worth it. (£10 for 2 lattes 1 with caramel)Very cool place and they play friends non stop what more could you want!
3
The Atmosphere was excellent and made you feel as if you are in their cafe. The staff were slow and unresponsive, the food was poorly planned, we had our main delivered while we still half way through our entree, had to ask twice for the drinks to come when nearly finished the meal. Could improve
5
We were treated so well and everything was perfect. The nostalgia was so perfect. I want to go back!
5
I loved my Joey's Sandwich with the generous amount of fries and the customisable coffee is great. We were greeted by friendly staffs and a continuous flow of the sitcom
4
Nice place to chill out with friends and love ones. Would defintely recommend others to visit. Do expect abit of walking from mrt to cafe.
4
The coffee was good yet a bit over priced and so was the chocolate cake .But is a very good ambience , and the staff was friendly too.
5
Nice place for family and friends gathering. Guys, bring your babes there and if its their first time, they will be impress by you. The Sugar Daddy speaks...
4
It's a friends themed restaurant which is ideal if you wanna catch up with your friends. Great food and lovely ladies who serve you with warmth and wonderful hospitality. Joey's latte, Joey's big breakfast, delicious pasta, juicy apple cider everything was great. Once a while if you are ok to spend a little extra, then you should go to this place..
3
It is something you need to visit! However, the location is so hard to find that even locals don't even know it exists. The food is ok but too expensive! The coffee was like a cheaper version of starbucks and yet again expensive. However it was really nice to sit and watch friend
4
Went to Central Perk for Ross Trivia night and the event was very good. They have prizes for almost everyone as long as you participate the trivia. They even have ballot prize for those who will order Ross food menu. The host is also entertaining and even the people who went there to participate the game. The place is good for chitchat, coffee/beer drinks with friends. Food is nice, though a bit pricey. But we definitely enjoyed our time on that day!
2
This restaurant is lovely to look at but that's where it's stop. Food was average. . Just ordered pizza. But staff need to learn about hospitality. ..Not friendly nor welcoming and I don't think I seen any of them smile. The whole time we were there !!Plenty of other places to eat.. give this a miss
5
I am an avid fan of Friends and I really love the idea of this themed cafe. It was so surreal to see some things that iâ€™ve been watching in the different episodes. I keep on watching back Friends and i still enjoy it a lot and visiting this cafe brings a lot of memories of episodes I follow
5
Excellent service, amazing ambience and an absolutely great replica of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Any and all Friends fan would Cherish this place. Has some great desserts, Lobster, mac&Cheese and beverages!
4
A place that brought all the memory back watching this sitcom... a place FRIENDS fans should visit... It was a Trivia night on Tuesday and learnt a lot more about FRIENDS in this night...
3
There was nothing special about the cafe. The only interesting in the menu was the edible heliem balloon. You get to hear yourself sounds like a cartoon character after inhaling the helium. Other than that, it feels like a starbucks cafe.
3
The place is nice and cozy with all the friends decors but the food and merchandise are too expensive.
1
Swung in here desperate for coffee to revive from jet lag. Service off-hand and slow. Coffee ok but not remarkable, unlike the price which was eye-wateringly expensive, even by Singapore standards. Served in mugs the size of buckets, but only half filled everything about the place failed to impress. Maybe I just don't like being ripped off....
4
Great way to spend your day. There is a wide selection of appetizers, mains and desserts, with interesting names featured on the show. If you're lucky to get the couch, you can lounge and enjoy your meal in the company of Friends, which is shown on a large projection screen through the day. However, for some other seats, you may have to crane your neck unless you have the space to manoeuvre your seat to get a better view of the screen. Do have a look at the memorabilia collection at Central Perk too
3
If you loved the show, then this worth going and having a look at. After reading the not so good food reviews we did not have anything to eat or drink. We did look at the menu and the prices seemed a little steep. All the set decor and different props are all really cool. There is the couch and the window, all really well done. The souvenirs on sale are outrageously priced. One visit is all you need to make
4
I went to the cafe with a friend and really loved the atmosphere and decor. I also liked the fact that they were playing episodes of FRIENDS so we can enjoy while eating. However, the price of the food is quite high for the quality of food. Hence, it would be great to visit the cafe as a one time thing out of novelty, but not as a regular thing as it is too expensive
3
The restaurant was pretty quiet on a Friday night. Most patrons are there for drinks and snapped pictures. There is a big projector screen showing episodes from the series. Service was good but I think the food is a tad bit over-priced for the quality they served. It is that kind of place you will only go once
5
We were going back to our hotel by walking from chinatown and before we reached the hotel we saw this huge cafe, since I was a huge fan of friends I told my family to have some coffee before we go back to the hotel. The lady welcome us and arrange the table quickly. So my Mom had the Phoebe Peanut Frappe which the waitress recommend. And I had the Lightly roasted latte in big cup. Most of ur ordered Sandwich with fries, and my husband asked if can make special orders since its not from the menu, then they able to make it. I really want to sit at the ionic orange couch so when the customer leaves I asked the waitress if we can shift there. She respond so quick and add tables and chairs. My husband love the coffee and ordered atleast 3 cups. The food is fine and served fast and hot. Superb service! Would love to come back again when we visit Singapore. Thanks to all the staff and to Central Perk.
4
Love the FRIENDS videos that are playing in the background - really added on to the atmosphere but pricey food.
3
Good ambience and F.R.I.E.N.D.S vibe but overpriced food. Food was just average. Won't be back again.
5
It lives well upto the hype. Good atmosphere. Good food. Great service. Definitely gonna visit again.
4
Servers are very welcoming and helpful. Food is tasty but i feel that it is a little over price. Ambience is good as it looks exactly like the sitcom Friends.
5
Good good ....lively music esp. smelly cat on Thursday's...... new bar recently opened....pleasant staff .... in the heart of the city.....
3
The set up like Central perk from Friends is a great idea for anyone who loved that sitcom, so we were delighted to enjoy this. All of our drinks were good. But the food was very disappointing. One of my daughter's dishes was barely warm and we had to ask for it to be reheated. My pasta dish wasn't very enjoyable either - the flavour was odd. Only the ribs tasted ok according to my other daughter. At a guess much of the food is cooked beforehand and reheated (for ribs that's fine but not for the other dishes). Would recommend only going here for a drink to enjoy Friends re-runs in the Central perk set up
5
This is the best place to hold a catch up session with your pals. It might be on the pricier side but totally worth its great ambiance, interiors ( spent a long time taking pictures at every corner of the place along with the props), delicious meal and good service. Would definitely be back again.

My family and I have been longing to visit Central Perk cafe, known as the remake cafe from the famous FRIENDS sitcom series. The last time we tried to visit, they were closed as it was a Monday. This time, we visited on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't too crowded but we made a reservation in advance just in case.We were seated on the famous orange couch (like seen in the series where the main cast always sit) and it really brought nostalgia to us as we love the series!Service was good. It took us a while to get our order as there were limited staff, and most of them were running around busy. The coffee took about 10 mins or so to arrive, and the food came first.For the food, we ordered a Rosti (named Ross-Ti in the menu), as we've always loved having Rosti as a family because of our love for its combination of fried cut potato with cheese. But unfortunately, this Rosti didn't satisfy our taste buds. It was a small portion for its $14 price tag, and it was almost tasteless. The coffee was alright. Again, small portion. It came in a big mug but served only less than half. But the way they served it was interesting. Each blend of coffee were named after the series' characters such as Rachel Green's coffee having a sweet taste while Chandler's coffee was strong and with a smoke taste (because he is known to smoke in the series). So we were quite fascinated by the concept. I didn't think the coffee was overpriced or poorly priced though. We loved the ambience of the cafe. They played episodes of the series on a projector and we truly enjoyed it from where we were seated. There were a lot of decorations and props as remembered from the series such as Chandler and Joey's foosball table, Monica's kitchen, etc.Overall, it was a memorable experience and we enjoyed our visit. But the service, the food and the coffee could be improved. If you decide to visit, keep an open mind about everything and go for the nostalgic experience and the love for the series
2
Nice location and atmosphere (American style bar/pub) - at least at first view.They were showing old episodes of "Friends" - much too loud, you could hardly have a talk. Servive was rather poor, they could not even inform us about the dishes they serve. High price level for food and drinks, which is standard for central Singapore.Last and least - the food the quality: we had two kinds of salads which were both horrible. Hardly any dressing, portion too small, not satisfying for the price
3
Spent about $100 just for two dishes plus a side and a drink. Had the Joey's salami pizza, average, had a weird taste with the pumpkin and also the lobster pasta, lobster probably were like a few week old as the pieces were puny, nothing bigger than a thumb. Mac n cheese was decent part of the meal, but that's about it
3
Nice venue for some catching up. Place a bit hard to find. Food and drinks are expensive. Best is to go once, try it out and be your last.
4
The atmosphere and settings is exactly like the series.
Great for the fans.
The selection of food and drinks are limited though.
4
The atmosphere is unlike any other.. but the prices are pretty steep.. so unless you are a die hard avid friends fan, the price may not be justified.
4
nice ambience, a nice place to chill. Food was alright, a little on the pricey side.
But really a good place to chill with your friends on a friday night.
Not very crowded.
2
Inflexible menu, no kids options, missing items from order. Agree with others, it theming over substance.
4
Overall our experience at the FRIENDS cafe was a great one. But I'll just mention ONE bad point before I go on to the rest. All the staff members were cheerful and helpful, except for one young girl who was rather pouty and glum from the moment we entered the cafe to the time we left. We managed to catch a glimpse of her name but we won't publicly name her. But we hope the staff can be reminded to be professional especially if you're the one receiving people at the entrance! Ok, the good things:1) Food was good. Portions were reasonable. But do note that prices are more high-end. 2) Calling early to make reservations is worth it as you get the more sought after seats. 3)It was a good journey into the world of FRIENDS, with regards to the mockup apartment wall (Joey & Chandler) and Monica's kitchen. You can even walk in through the brown cafe door as though you're walking in from the streets of NY. Fun! Erm but at the retail section: merchandise is quite expensive. Eg a coffee Mug for SGD59!4) They were playing random episodes of FRIENDS. Fun to watch and eat and feel almost at home!
4
Central Perk is definitely a must visit restaurant for people who have been watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S through out the years. The ambience is amazing, they play the series on a big screen. The food is not that great and expensive. One must visit this restaurant strictly only for the ambience
4
Great place to visit. Little pricey but good experience the edible helium balloons we unavailable s they ran out of helium gas but they gave us the cake and ice-cream that goes with it for free. They play episodes of friends on a drop down screen which is cool except everybody seemed to just watch it rather than socialise
4
The atmosphere is really relaxing and nostalgic.The foods – didn’t really live up to its price.Coffee was great – you get to choose the intensity of the brew and your own blend (latte, Americano or cappuccino).Prices – too expensive.Staffs – they were all accommodating and really friendly
4
Have been a big fan of the FRIENDS Tv Show since I was young and by visiting the Central Perk Singapore I could recognize almost everything since it was all related to the show. I was impressed with the idea that they showed episodes of the Tv show on the projector for the visitors to enjoy.. I myself saw 3 shows while I was having tea. We had tea and the chocolate mud cake (Joeys fav I suppose) and it was good.Overall it's a must visit for all FRIENDS lovers!
4
It was a pleasant surprise that the food was pretty good actually. Fans of friends should flock to this place as the place is a replica of the TV show.
3
When the restaurant has a special lunch menu they should ensure not to run out of items, especially if only 8 people order it. Salads are just a bowl of leaves. Service is poor. Coffee is good
4
Went for the lunch at this place. Food is decent there but quite pricey. However it's a must-go for fans of friends.
2
Was not value for money. Can do much better with the menu and the volume is too loud to have a conversation.
3
The experience was certainly tailored for fans of the show. So much attention was given to the details: the interiors, the menu, the meechandise. They were even screening the show. If I were a massive fan, i'd be bleeding with delight. The food was good, albeit on the pricey side. I wanted to eat more, but was quite conscious of the price. In here, one pays for the experience, not ao much the flavors of the food. Don't get me wrong; The food is not bad! Just know that you are in the restaurant not for the food, but for the ambience.
4
The café was everything I'd hoped as it looked very similar to that of the TV show. Wouldn't be called Central Perk if it wasn't, now would it? I loved everything about it. The ambience and how they played episodes of FRIENDS on a white screen with a projector. They had bits and pieces of replicas that belonged to the characters on the show. My favourite one was Monica's kitchen as I know the characters from Friends were always at her crib. And as a child from the 90s, I grew up watching them though it was only during my teenage years that I understood their inside jokes. I've always liked the characters being together, so I was lucky to have had both my boyfriend and bestfriend with me at the café enjoying our coffee in large cups as we ate good food, whilst watching Friends episodes. Best time ever!Moving on, the food was great though it was a bit on the pricey side. However, it was expected since Singapore in general is expensive and that was something unique. The spinach is one of the best, as well as the pasta! Oh and don't forget the coffee! Thumbs up for this café
2
We're Major Friends fans who were likely to forgive most atrocities here but it's way too much. Can the staff BE any more un-enthusiastic about the theme menu? *chandler style* And c'mon, they gave black faces when we requested them to take photos for us at the memorabilia area where it's meant for fans to snap away! Food was ridiculously gross, tasted like plastic melted inside the instant food.. and $35-40 for mains, $30-35 for pasta... no thanks! The only good thing is the cafe was so empty that we managed to get the centre sofa facing the huge screen showing snippets of friends! If only the prices were more reasonable and quality of food slightly more decent, it would be bustling w friends fans and their families!
3
This cafe excited mixed emotions. I'm a big fan of "friends" and I was really delighted at first when I saw all decorations. They are really very nice! On the other hand, service was very poor. I came at 9:45 pm and asked waiter to make coffee, but she said that they have just washed coffee machine and now they doesn't serve coffee. I asked one more time, because most of all I wanted to drink a cup of coffee at "cental perk". But they said "NO". I can't understand, how is it possible not to serve coffee an hour and a half before closing (working hours 11am-11 pm)??Heavy disappointment!
3
Definitely worth it for all FRIENDS fans, I think they did a stellar job of recreating the decor and feel of the FRIENDS show. However, the most iconic "couch" from Central Perk cafe requires a minimum $400 spend which, consider the couch can only fit 4 people at a time is really quite ridiculous.If it's so coveted, restaurant should consider doing a rotating basis for the couch so that all patrons can have an opportunity to have a turn and capture photos there. Prices are on the high side but is to be expected for such a themed cafe. However, I feel they could have upped the portions for what they are serving. The coffee only fills half the mug, why so stingy?
4
Got bombed with episodes of "Friends" upon entering the cafe. Shop fit and decorations replicate the TV series and definitely a hit with fans of "Friends". However, came for the food and surprisingly found the coffee to my liking. With 4 types of roast/beans, you can find what you like to perfection. Always like my espresso with a good roasted taste but not too much acidity, and found their Joey Tribianni beans perfectly suited. Mudcake was really rich, but then again, it is a mudcake. Will go back for a meal, but hopefully not with "Friends" blasting throughout the entire meal
3
Difficult to find this place. I went there because i am big fan of friends series. The place is big. I love their theme ..good place to hangout. But very expensive. It was fun to take pics.
5
For a fan of the show Friends, there is NOTHING BETTER! No detail is over looked, the set, the menu, everything! So much nostalgia. The food and coffee were great. But the ambiance made it feel like being a kid in a candy store.
4
The place gives people a nostalgic feeling. Huge place for friends to chill and have coffee. Food is quite costly.
5
Really exciting if you're a fan of friends but food is quite overpriced. But still a must-visit at least once in your life with your Favourite group of friends!!
3
Decent bistro food for fine dining prices eg a small slice of choco mud cake costs $16 and a cup of latte $8 (although it is a large cup). My friends and I were there more for the novelty factor but unlikely to visit again.
4
I went with my mother and both of us are super fans for Friends. The design wasn't totally comply to the original TV series scene but about 70% is the same. I was very surprised about the food, they tasted very yummy and it wasn't usual for theme cafe to have such high quality food in Singapore. But I have to say that the dishes are a little bit pricey. We ordered Monica's Pasta and Baby Pork Ribs, together with Matcha and Hot chocolate. Will recommend their Baby Pork Ribs
3
Details of the cafe interior was well taken care of. Ambience was perfect. However service was very bad. No smile on their faces, unprofessional ways of serving food. Rosti was beyond terrible. It was severely undercooked, tasted like crunch raw potato. It was tasteless too. Food was not worth the prices.
4
I went there for dinner with a few friends. The atmosphere is very pleasing, a lot of nostalgic decoration which will bring you back to friends' movie scenes. They show in a wide screen some episodes from the TV series. The staff were very friendly and cheerful, they offer great service.Having said that, be ready to spend if you go to this place. In general, I think per person you will easily hit $50. If you order fancy drinks and dessert, you might spend around $80. The quality of the food is alright, but not fantastic.Well...it's a themed cafe, so we all know what to expect. Do make sure that you bring your camera and take a lot of pictures while you're there

We loved the tv series so we just had to try Central Perk (F.R.I.E.N.D.S Cafe). Was there at 5pm on a Saturday. Place was a bigger & more spacious version of the original. The sofas with coffee tables were obviously favored by patrons over the dining tables & chairs as the former were fully occupied. Maybe because facing the sofa section was a huge screen showing episodes from the tv series. As such, some customers were watching & laughing, feeling right at home. The other section had a smaller screen. Some of the food were pricey for the quality. Monica's lasagna ($26) was a bit dry & the eggplant in it was tough. Chandler's mac & cheese ($14) was such a small portion and it was too al dente. Creamed spinach with wagyu bacon ($14) was also a sad small portion and a bit watery. The garlicky french fries ($10) was good though and so was Rachel's green salad ($13).Coffee too was dear at $8 each. Good coffee in big mugs...yeah but still. We had 4 lattes, namely : Chandler Bing, Ross Gellar, Joey Tribbiani & Rachel Green. The servers were a stark contrast to the cafe's warm ambience. They were aloof & cold with dead eyes. Not a hint of smile. Like robots. Creepy. Note, on top of the prices quoted above there's additional 10% schg and 7% gst so "ouch". We'll probably go back for the novelty of the place but not anytime soon.

Central Perk, right across the street from the Holiday Inn Express at Clarke Quay, is a fun place to relax and walk down memory lane. Episodes run all the time on the TVs, and some memorabilia from the show is also on exhibit. A very unusual (at least to this American)find in Singapore

It was pricey, but you pay for the ambience.... and i went there on trivia night, which was very interesting! Worth a visit!

Briliant place. Had joey's ride along sandwich (the one that joey took a bullet for) for 21 SGD. Great staff as well.

It was a very good experience to enjoy the food and atmosphere. I feel as if I was in the TV series myself. 👍👍

It took forever to get our mediocre food and forever to get the bill. I would only go here if I were a Friends fanatic.

Great concept- but sadly, food wasn't as good as what I paid it to be. It was nice to have a big screen with Friends episodes playing one after another and the service staff being on beat with the claps for the theme song.

I'm one of the greatest fan of Friends. Hence the expectations were really high when I first heard about the opening of Central Perk in Singapore. I saw a couple of attempts in other cities, mostly they were not even close to the original one.Well, this place really wants you to feel like in the scene of Friends, just like in the Universal Studio or DisneyLand. The atmosphere, the furnitures are all look like the original one. There is a fan store, where you can buy collectibles. And a huge screen showing the episodes, so you can constantly check if it's really like there.The menu is pretty ok, the name of the foods are trying to recall the stories from the series. However wasted opportunity that they are not offering the most obvious food that is coming from the sitcom: 'Joey's special'. Even more disappointing that when I asked the waitress if they have it, she was just looking at me confused and wanted to suggest me to choose something else from the menu. For those who don't know, 'Joey's special' is very simple: two pizzas.Otherwise the staff is friendly and helpful, however it's not enough to cover the huge place. One or two more waitress could give a faster service.Last but not least, the food. Honestly it's a disappointment. The quality barely acceptable. I would expect way much more. We ordered Mac&Cheese, which arrived 3 minutes after the order, providing that it was warmed in microwave. Second dish was a Ribs, very simple tasting. Finally we had a cheesecake which tasted very artificial.Summing up, if you are a Friends fan, I would suggest to visit to place, it's fun, but don't expect too much from the catering. Better just have a coffee, watch the episodes and laugh a lot

It was a very spacious cafe, much to our surprise. Menu was really cute with everything Friends infused into it. If you love the series, you would love the place! Except for the fact that you would not see the live chicken and duck that Joey and Chandler keep as pets, everything else is somewhat made to look just like what you see in the show. We ordered three mains and a side; seafood stew, turkey and the lobster pasta and the MAC and cheese side. Overall, the best dish was the lobster pasta, cooked al dente, and at the right spice level! Seafood stew, turkey and MAC&cheese were pretty much average, nothing much to mention. Just take note that it's a rather pricey experience, so be prepared to pay for it. I ordered a cup of jasmine tea and it cost me $5. Friends merchandise is also being sold there, with their coffee mugs sold at $49.90 Worth a visit, at least once.

Stumbled on this place, when travelling past in a bus and boy was I in for a treat. As a crazy Friends fan this was like a Mecca for all things friends. The restaurant shows episodes of friends while customers are in a friends themed restaurant. There is also a display like section at the entrance showing glimpse of different sets with the ability to purchase gifts. Food wise there is a wide range of food and drinks, all names or linked to friends episodes. The dessert and drink I had was tasty, but overpriced. Service was great. Managed to spend more than a hour here, definitely would come back again

As a FRIENDS fan, I was very anticipated to go there and I wasn't disappointed. I love how the cafe dedicated a part to each of the members by displaying items unique to each of them. The service is great too as they were able to show us around and introduce us to each member area. The ambience of great and I loved how the eating area is modeled after the original Central Perk itself. The food and coffee is good, especially for the coffee, where the taste is customizable based on the qualities of each member. However, while ordering a cup of coffee for myself, I only shared a pizza with my friend as the food can be quite expensive

If you are feeling a wave of nostalgia, then head on to Central Perk. Yes, the same cafe that Rachel works in and where Ross, Chandler and Joey would hang out. It’s the Friends themed cafe that replicates the atmosphere quite well and is also the only one in the world outside of the United States that is officially licensed by Warner Brothers. It is a novelty restaurant, so the decor and atmosphere is the bigger draw instead of the food and servings, but once you step inside, you might be asking yourself, “how you doin…

Serving sizes are small, and rather pricey. Food was average. Order a stack of pork ribs for about 30 plus dollars. A small plate of calamari is 14 dollars. Overall service was slow, perhaps they are understaffed.
5
Such a layer back atmosphere! So many different scenes in one spot allowing you to reminisce on all your favourite episodes! Absolutely loved it! Will be back!
4
Everything was in themed, including the names of their dishes. Interesting menu and friendly staffs, but the food is pricey.
3
Apart from the set up of the cafe, nothing much. Food was below average, the sautéed mushrooms we had were drenched in salt ( we turned to see table beside us had left a huge portion untouched as well), our truffle fries were equally salty that we were jokingly asking each other if the chefs were so busy & slammed with orders that their sweat was what we tasted in our food! Drinks- nothing much to comment. Atmosphere- live band, too overly loud with kids ( probably followers of the band) cheering, screaMing their lungs out. We had to scream our orders to our servers/cashiers & amongst ourselves. Location- okay. Old MoMo club area. Alittle too far off for a cafe,( not for a club back then obviously!) Interior- Love it , definitely the only reason why people go there & probably the only reason. Arrangement of the seatings are really bad. Congested. We had to get off our seats for the next table to get out. Our chairs were literally back to back. Service- The only thing that I can give props to was their service. Tiptop, immaculate service. From the ease of changing my reservation, to getting orders sent quickly and correctly. Friendly, young staffs! Really good ! Overall, not coming bad. Unless the menu change, the sound system has to go then probably yes.

Central Perk is a good place to hangout with friends have something to bite and glass of beer. Although the chair is not that comfortable, I think if we had the table with a sofa it will be better. The crew was very nice, they serve you with smile. I found the food was pricey for its size and have average taste.

Food was kinda pricey but the entire set up made up for it! Major F.R.I.E.N.D.S fans would love this place because they practically recreated everything on set. Kudos to the team for the detailed effort! Our total bill came up to $91 for 2 mains, a slice of cake and 2 coffees. In terms of value for money... for this price I'll be better off at a buffet. But like I said, you're mostly paying for the theme :)

I am a F.R.I.E.N.D.S sitcom fanatic so when I heard about the opening of the cafe, I had to come & see for myself. I have only great things to say! I loved that every detail was carefully considered and elements of the original cafe in the sitcom was present in every nook and cranny of this restaurant.The sitcom was playing on the big screen. Merchandise was sold in the cafe. We could play Fusball for free!I would go back there again just for the atmosphere!Minus: Hard to get the staffs attention as they were busy. Food & drinks are overpriced and nothing fantastic to rave about. Menu could have been more extensive.Location was obscure...had to rely on google map

First of all, the only good thing about this cafe is when they show the hit series sitcom, F.R.I.E.N.D.S, bringing back those old days! Food are terribly OVERPRICED with below expectation!!! With that kind of price we expect a good service and good food but service is just average! They usher us to our sits BUT never give us the menu until we ask for it! FYI, the place is NOT crowded. I order their special brew made coffee BUT the coffee is like third quarter of the cup! I rather buy coffee at Starbuck or Coffee Beans with that kind of price. The Mac & Cheese (Mac and Cheese is my favourite, you cannot lie on my taste buds) is more of Mac & Truffles, Truffles taste too strong, not much of a cheese. Chocolate mudcake not worth because i can get Coffee Club mudcake at the same price! At first we wanted to buy their main dish after a very bad dessert and side, we change our mind. This is my beginning and my last. I rather spent that money on PAUL and TWG. Sorry i'm being honest if comparing the price and food to other fine dining

The setup was not an exact replica of Central Perk but it was really refreshing and cosy! The environment was really spacious and neat. The food is expensive but understandable due to their high franchise fee. A lot of effort has been put into creating unique menu items that represent the characters or food in the TV show. Their coffee is affordable at $8.

They've certainly spent a great deal on making this place resemble the actual Central Perk cafe in the Friends sitcom. Beautiful! Fans of Friends would love it! But I have one problem, and that is the food. It's not priced appropriately for a casual café experience. At $110 for two people, it is as expensive as a fine-dining restaurant. (Mains were $40, coffee was $10, dessert was $20). The food and drinks quality didn't match the price point. They may get people coming once, but it'll be tough to get them coming back more often. They've got to consider that their market, fans of Friends, is a declining market as the sitcom finished more than a decade ago and isn't getting more followers. Fans of Friends are those in their 30s and 40s who probably have kids. Something worth considering when designing the menu. Maybe add a kids corner too. If this place is to succeed long-term, they've got to grow out of the novelty and be known for something more than just a Friends-themed place. Also, a casual café experience with fancy fine-dining prices isn't going to work.

Central perk was a great experience especially for friends' fans. The cafe lives up to our expectations in terms of the theme and authenticity but food was quite expensive and not worth the money
4
The food is kinda large portion and love the flavour. Purely based on friends theme series. Fans must visit and the few whom are not aware of the series will enjoy the theme as well.
4
Very nice place to be, it has been re-created exactly as the show, ranging from all the big moments on show to the very small things as well. Must visit for all the friends fan.
5
Visited last weekend, good vibes and good food. Definitely coming back. Service was speedy, food arrived promptly! Kudos to The Central perk team!!

Nice service, attentive staff and certainly plenty to satisfy fans of the show from Phoebe's macabre artwork to Monica's kitchen set up so there's lots of photo ops. The menu has lots of cutely named items - Joey's meatball sub and even a full turkey (no Rachel trifle though) but it's really expensive - a small piece of cheesecake is $18 and postcards are $6. One visit probably enough but I can't imagine having the budget to hang out as much as the friends cast ever did

My wife and I went with a friend to celebrate the New Year. They didn't really have any specials going on and the crowd was pretty low key leading up to midnight but that was great because we wanted low key. Some might think this is a gimmick. Something that you'd find in Taipei but this place is really well done. My wife and our friend were super impressed and both of them are big fans of the show, which is why we ended up there. I love the concept of being able to watch episodes while there. I would honestly like to go hangout there for a cup of coffee and to chill and watch the show. We had 2 lattes with different coffees in them and a dessert. The dessert was really good and the coffees were surprisingly tasty. After 10 pm, we got drinks. They had an ale on draft that I'd never had before and the girls got cocktails. Everything on the menu is tied to the show by name and show reference. It's pretty cool for anyone who remotely knows F.R.I.E.N.D.S. The one knock is that the bill was a bit high. 8$ for coffees and $12-16 for wine and beer is normal (in Singapore). The cocktails are $18 I believe but the mains were $20-45 I think, which is high for what's supposed to be a cafe. All in all, I'll stick to drinks and dessert at this place along with a few episodes of Friends

New York City has the first Central Perk cafe and now I am proud to say that Singapore has the second one in the whole wide world.If you are a fan of the TV series, it will be such an enjoyable visit to this place. it is like walking in the filming set! They even have the signature couch and if you really want to sit there, reservation is advisable. And you probably will be in the limelight of envy and jealousy for occupying the best seat in the place. When I was there, they were playing episodes of FRIENDS and it is a great way to remind ourselves again how funny the characters are and how smart and funny the episodes are written. The cafe is huge but given the location is just next to a hotel across the road and the popularity of the TV series, it will be good to reserve a table before gatecrashing. The foods are all named after the characters. It is fun reading the menu but the prices can be quite steep. My friends and I had 2 pizzas at a "special" price of over $40. The coffee is at a more affordable price of $8. But, I am not complaining because the dining experience is worth every dollar spent. It is also very interesting to see the waitresses are constantly helping the customers to take pictures next to the props. I can see they are very happy to do so. The service staff is friendly. Well done

Fans of the show will be pleased with the design and thought put into this place. The decor is designed with extreme detail to recreate the show and set, along with character walls and Monica's kitchen. Even the menu is full of references and thematic food (which also tastes great). In addition, the service is excellent with very attentive, friendly staff. Overall I really enjoyed the whole ambience and it was an experience I'll definitely come back for. Even if you aren't a fan, this place is still really worth a visit :
5
Definitely check this place out! Some might say that the menu is overpriced and all and it certainly is on the high side, but the experience delivered was on point and the food served is definitely not your regular cafe standards! Service staff are mostly good looking too!The mushroom soup was really special, the scent of porcini and truffle really shows effort from the chefs! I had the Monica's Aglio olio and it was heavenly. The pasta was al dente and very flavourful. Served with scallops and prawns I can't say that it's not worth my $24!! Mudcake was so rich I believe you won't find the same just anywhere. The candied almond on top was special too.All in all, this place outright beat my expectations and I'll definitely return again. Two thumbs u

Hey guys! if you're a fan of FRIENDS you should check out this place! this place is HUGE! it's an exact replica of the whole set of central perk! they even screen endless episodes of FRIENDS on the projector so you can sit back relax, eat/drink whilst watching the famous sitcom in the 90s. Even if you're not a fan, you can still enjoy the ambience with yr family and friends. Their coffee is amazing and their food is superb! Excellent service! Your trip here will be worth i

If you are a fan of FRIENDS, this is the place to be. If you aren't it is also a good place to have coffee at, considering they have 6 blends available. Food is great, however comes at a price as well.

Central Perk SG is a fantastic representation of the Central Perk from the TV show FRIENDS. The food is so good and everything is so thematic! I love it, they've really gone all out and put in so much effort for the fans!
4
As a FRIENDS fans you should definitely check out this place. The Central Perk set recreation was on point, it made you feel like you are there. They even have some Friends most-famous memorabilia on display at the entrance.The food and drink was worth the price too. Moreover the staffs are really friendly.All in all, a must visit place :
5
Central Perk SG lived up to every expectation i had! The ambience was very warm and welcoming with enthusiastic and bubbly staff. You could see a lot of thought went into the presentation & taste of the food (The cheese cake left me having goose bumps in my mouth..) (I don't know if that's even possible, but it did ) They even had a museum section for each of the six characters!! And my absolute favourite part was when everyone, working & dining in, tried to clap along to the theme song! Overall, it was a great experience ❤ It is a must to check them out
5
The setting of the restaurant was specifically designed to look like a studio set of Central Perk, and it is evident that much effort went into the decor. You can find the iconic orange couch, Gunther's bar and Phoebe's performance stage here. The menu is very well-thought with food items re-created from the show. Janice's OMG Baby back ribs and the heavy fudge chocolate mudcake tasted so good!!!! Price is a little high but it is worth it if you consider the experience and the quality of the food. Even the plating of the food is very well done and pretty
5
Stepping into Central Perk SG was like taking a trip down memory lane. Everything from the deco to the food was meticulously planned out. Food tasted as delicious as it looked and staff were very friendly and enthusiastic. They even had a museum section dedicated to each of the characters! You can even watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S episodes with your friends while you dine. Overall a great experience
5
For a FRIENDS fan, the experience is just out of the world! 5 Stars. 1.The decor. It is almost like a dream come true. Monica's apartment, kitchen, joey's fine Italian craftman cabinet, pacman machine (its functional) and just so much more! They even have a alfresco area made like the streets of New York! 2. The Menu. Every item on the menu was so thought through. Everything is related to the show and the amount of effort that went into it is just amazing. Even the plating is just leaps and bound above usual cafes. 3. The service crew. I was served by this lady and the moment i walked in they gave us a tour of the space. They explained the coffee menu to us and it was just so thematic. They even clap together during the Friends opening song! All in all, its more than a cafe, its really an experience
4
When we first walked into Central Perk, we thought it was a great representation of the one in FRIENDS and we liked how the seating away from the 'set' are directors seats, maintaining the TV theme. We were greeted by very friendly staff upon arriving, and they gave a clear description of the menus. We ordered the garlic chips to share which was the highlight of our meal - we even ordered them twice! The pizza and linguine we ordered were nice, but we felt that they could have been better priced. For dessert we had the cheesecake - it was very beautifully presented and tasted good! The drink: strawberry earl grey was very sweet, but yummy!We also got taken on a tour around the character sections which was fun, and got to play some pacman in Monica's kitchen - which is also very close to the real thing!Overall, we had lots of fun here and would definitely go back again
