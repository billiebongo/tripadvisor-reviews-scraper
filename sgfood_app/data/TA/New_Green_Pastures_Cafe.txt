Yummy vegan sushi recovering from #InternationalSushiDay, this place has an awesome and very fresh selection of vegan foods and also organic quality. Together with the sushi I enjoyed a freshly made apple juice.

Inexpensive vegetarian restaurant at 4th floor of Fortune center. Friendly service, but food wasn't that spectacular, tasted like my mother's cooking. Brown rice available, healthy food.

Yong tau foo - it is a dish of varied simple and complicated ingredients...but variety cannot save this dish if there is no "killer sauce". At this organic vege place run by the friendly owner Aunty Sophia, the items are already chosen for you..so no hassle of deciding what to pick. You get a bowl filled with colorful ingredients and beautiful textures of chewy and crunchy items..stuffed bittergourd, corn-on-the-cob, carrot, seitan, shitake mushroom among others. The sauce does not kill, it just makes you fall deeply in love with it ...gently and slowly with each bite. It is a beautiful blend of earthy, yet light taste with subtle aromatics. You do not even realise that time is passing and your bowl is getting emptier...a totally in the moment experience...at the end there is only bliss and a smile on your lips. Consider having their yong tau foo if you need a new way to meditate and experience profound now-ness. Best enjoyed with zero conversation

I came to this small vegetarian restaurant hidden away on the 4th floor of the Fortune Centre earlier in the week for lunch with a friend. I opted for the Japanese bento box which looked like a real bento box but instead of having fish and meat, everything was actually vegetarian. The food was quite tasty and I wouldn't mind coming back for another visit

Managed to steal a lunch on a work day with my wife at her favourite vegetarian restaurant. It's I. Fortune Center where there are many vegetarian options. The different is that it not full of mock meat but mainly from fresh organic ingredients. Making very meal here refreshing, not heavy and feeling good

I have been going here for years. Every time in Singapore I will get here as often as my busy schedule allows. The food is not just healthy, vegan and organic but innovative and delectable. And of course the ambiance and the flamboyant knowledgeable owner is always ready to answer any questions regarding the food to fill your mind not just your belly. As well, I can pick up some organic foods and oils while I am there. I have tried a number of restaurants of this type in Singapore, but this is the one that stands above the rest. You will not be disappointed

Really good genuine organic vegetarian food. Been eating here for the past 10 years now. the standard of food is still the same. The owner is passionate about healthy vegetarian food. I have tried pretty much everything on their menu. Sophia makes sure there are 5 colors of vegetables in her meals. High price but real organic food used. She also uses proper filtered water that is alkaline. Her restaurant has been around 20 years now. I have patronized her for the past 10 years and her standard and quality is still the same with extra new dishes. Love this place suitable for vegans too

The place is overpriced. We are regular here. We love their unique vegetarian bibimbap . The thunder tea rice is great as well. They have some free soup kind, which is quite bad:) Soft pillow sandwich is awesome, that's my another fav. The place boasts of 99.9% pesticide free, which makes me feel good. Overall, I enjoy the fact that I can eat at some great vegetarian places like this in Singapore (that heavily relies on MSG and preservatives

Great healthy vegetarian food! The cafe is located on the 4th floor In The Fortune Centre. The food is fresh and tasty. The place has a relaxed , homey feel to it. It is a cafe & organic grocery store. I highly recommend sandwich, brown rice set and thunder tea rice! Sushi rolls ( without rice) were ok, but nori was too tough too eat because it wasn't moist enough ! The presentation of the food was great and the portions generous enough ! Prices are reasonable for organic healthy meal - not more than 10$. I really liked the place and will definately go back
