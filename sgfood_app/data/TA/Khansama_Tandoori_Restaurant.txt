The food is just amazing, so tasty. Big portions and always feel full after.
The butter chicken and samosas are both great, we’ve been back many times.

Loved it here, staff great, the service was good and quick, the food was delicious. Good value for money would visit again when back in Singapore.

A very goo option for the non veggies .. Butter Chicken and Naan is what we had and it was awesome .. gulped it down with a coke and had a tandoori for starter .. a typical Indian affair but worth every penny ...

Went there for business dinner with Indian friends. Food was quite good with reasonable price. The dinning place is small and outdoor.
2
We came here for dinner. We ordered few dishes and also some drinks. The waiter was extremely impatient and rude. We just merely asked some questions regarding some drinks, but the waiter not only rude but also extremely impatient when answering our question. As for the food, it's quite decent but it's extremely salty. When we complains, the waiter just said that's their standard

Little India is crowded and busy. We sat downstairs but under a fan. Tables and chairs was big and heavy. Amused at their rating on the menu..."probably best Indian restaurant in northern Singapore So many choices and we preferred to do some tastings. I wrote everything on a piece of paper.We enjoyed our tastes of India very much. The vegetable fried rice was the highlight.Prices were average fir this type of restaurant. Highly recommend if you visit Little India.

Have been to this restaurant before and found their food was ok.Recently I had from few of my friends that this is a good place to dine ( considering the budget and quality of food they offer ) so decided for a second visit.My Visit:As I was visiting with my wife (before even I ask) I was happily offered a seat at the first floor.The Ambiance:The ambiance looks quite good actually with Indian feel ( although one of the recent reviews states that they have modified their ambiance and the previous one was better)The Service:The chairs are very heavy. If not for me then atleast for my wife I would expect that the waiter would help in handling the chair while visiting (I have seen this in India and maybe that might not be a norm here)The service is slow . Considering the restaurant didnâ€™t look overcrowded we found that the service was slow. Also in India I have seen that the waiter would serve the main course from the bowl in the plate, and also serve the naan, look for any further help required such as when the bread/veggies start to finish and the customer might be looking for ordering/refilling. I am not complaining but these are good to have to make a difference (considering Khansama serves Indian cuisines)The Food: We ordered veg manchow soup(came with sev instead of fried noodles), assorted pakoras ( they were okay ) mix veg ( the garnishing was good ) and naans ( naans were perfect)The Good: While in Singapore it is very difficult to find restaurants offering free drinking water- I think this is the area where the restaurant scored while with free drinking waterAt the last I would say we might have made a wrong choice by ordering non-tandoori food at a tandoori restaurant and wish that our next visit will be a pleasant experience

Popped in here for a cold beer and a quick lunch. Hit the spot. I had a chicken tikka and a Roti. Everything was cooked fresh and was delicious.Beer was icy cold too.There were lots of other people in the restaurant eating larger meals and their food looked good too.Very reasonable prices
3
The restaurant is located in the middle of Little India, very convenient to walk from Little India MRT station. Food is adequate in the portion size also with a fine touch of North Indian Style cooking. Flavour: 3/5Portion: 4/5Service: 3.5/5Staff Friendliness: 4/5Ambience: 2.5/5*** PS chairs are very heavy and uncomfortable.Recommendation: Chicken tikka & Rogan Jos

The curry was actually OK, Butter Chicken was tasty but in Little India that wouldn't be surprising. what I didn't like about this place is that you feel like they are rinsing you for every penny. As soon as you sit down the guy is at the table waiting for you to order and suggesting you add yoghurts etc but he doesn't make any sensible offerings. It just felt like he was seeing what he could get you to add on....from bread to special rice to starters. We then asked for a curry with veg rather than Paneer and he said definitely and then it came out with paneer. he just seemed uninterested and just after billing you a huge amount. In the end it came to $160 Singaporean for 4 people - no starters and just a few beers. Seemed ridiculous when down the road you can get the same for less than half. He probably didn't realise we have been to this area many times because we had the Inlaws with us so we looked like typical unassuming tourists but I instantly latched on to his game. I would be very careful if you visit here as a tourist, just make sure you don't over order. Location is great and the guys hawking the street do a good job of selling the place to unassuming tourists but they don't approach any locals
5
If you are a hungry Indian vegi in Little India area, simply head for this place. There is very little that goes wrong here. Prices are a tad on the high side.
4
very much down the earth in all food service and price.fee like home made food here with family is i suggest must eat place.
5
Definitely worth getting out of your hotel. Food is flavoursome with marvellous spices. Recommend a visit here. Little India is great too.
5
Excellent place to enjoy Indian food.
It's very tasty. All served by very nice and friendly staff. If you are not sure what to order, just tell the waiter who the food supposed to be done.
3
Well it's in little India . There are more than 100 places to go and have food. But it's highly recommend if you wanna have north indian. It would be among top 10 indian restaurant in Singapore if they keep serving like this. Very reasonable
5
We’re from the UK and came here on recommendation. Absolutely some of the best Indian food we’ve ever eaten. Staff are on the ball, helpful and confident.
5
We went twice for dinner , felt like home ,well mannered staff,down to earth owner, extremely well prepared dishes veg & non veg both ,indian beer, and that too at a reasonable price in Singapore,what else one could wish .Thanks .We r coming back this evening too for dinne
5
Khansama Tandoori is across of Sri Veeramakaliamman temple, which also a must visit place for tourist when comes to Little India. Khansama Tandoori offers an authentic India cuisine. I had cheese naan, mutton rogan josh which is a baby lamb cooked with herbs and spices cooked with dhaba style, chicken tikka masala and bryani for lunch. Before you order, it's better to ask the portion of the food first. Since their serving portion is quite enough for two for one serving. The food was delicious and the staff was also responsive
3
The food is excellent here and I’ve been many times. It’s one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore as it has a lovely ambience, dim lighting and an Indian feel to itI visited last night and was totally shocked at the new decor. The lovely authentic feel has gone and it now has overhead bright lights, white walls and resembles a clinic. I am really sad that the old Khansama ambience has gone and think this huge mistake will affect their trade.I’m sadly now reluctant to go bac

Was in singapore with office friends recently and took them to khansama. They had neer been there and were craving for indian food. So took thwm to my favourite indian food joint in little india, singapore. They were very finger licking happy with the food quality, taste and ambience, though we all had only vegetarian food. Just loved it
5
Was greeted by a gentleman that was extremely friendly and nice. He suggested the butter chicken and the chicken tika masala (not sure if I spelt that right) but nevertheless it was astonishing! Definitely will be going back again during our stay in Singapore!
4
Our group of four stumbled across this restaurant while exploring Little India. We were seated upstairs in the air conditioned section and had a delicous meal including naans, spicy curries and black lentil dhal and mango lassi. We will definitely be back!
4
Food was excellent, just in Singapore where there’s great cheap street food it hard to pay $5 for a bowl of plain rice to go along with your curry and naan.
5
Over all on of the best food I had on my trip to Singapore and definitely one of the best Indian food I have had in my trips abroad.Their Daal Makhni and Mutton Rogan Josh was amazing and Chicken Biryani A’s expected was just slight above average.Will come here again whenever in Singapore!
4
Perfectly located and delicious Indian restaurant right on the corner. I shared the butter chicken and garlic naan. I loved the food, the location and the prices which all made up for the service that was a bit on the slow side. Honestly, it was a casual laid back day in Little India so the slow service was not really an issue
5
I was seriously impressed by this place when I visited last night with my husband and his parents. I have always loved Indian food, the spicier the better. This place gets everything spot on. The flavours are incredible, I had a chaat (peanut) and Chana Masala for main course both of which were incredible. I am a vegetarian but my mother in law had the Butter Chicken and I tried the sauce. I can honestly say I have never tasted such a delicious curry sauce before! It is so so flavourful, a shame they don’t do a Butter Masala for us veggies! We all came away saying how much we enjoyed the food immensely. Another thing is the service is so warm and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble, the lady who served us was so kind and patient in explaining things on the menu. When one of the curries was too spicy for my mum in law they took it away and added yoghurt for her. The price was also very good for four. I have eaten at Banana Leaf too and it just doesn’t compare to Khansama. We will definitely be back
5
Stumbled on this place by pure chance, walking along the road and handed a menu, typically I would dismiss this but it looked busy so thought "I'm hungry, why not" so glad I did, the service was excellent and the food exceptional. I would highly recommend. I have 5 days in Singapore to sample it's culinary delights and so far it's off to a fantastic start
5
We stumbled across this place just walking through Little India and decided to sit and have a meal. We shared the Tikka Mix and a few naan breads. The chicken just fell apart and it was hard to choose a favourite! We went back the following night and had their butter chicken with cheese naan and it was SO good my husband and I didn't even talk through the whole meal - we were far too involved with the food!This restaurant actually gave me one of the highlights of my trip! I asked to go into the kitchen and see a tandoor as I'd never seen one before. They graciously escorted me to the kitchen and allowed me to watch how it was all prepared and made. Being a naturally curious person; this was perfect for me :)Note: This place is expensive in terms of other food in the area. You're looking at anything from $14-$19 a main

We came there for our 2nd dinner in Singapore due to word by mouth and we have been so positively surprised that we ended dining there every other evening!We tried hard to order something different everyday, and everyday we fell in love with something new.Here is an extremely picky rating of our dishes, even though they all deserved a 4 or a 5 :- palak paneer and baighan barta (2 vegetarian dishes) were a bit disappointing by lacking of "power" in comparison with the "meat" dishes. However they were cooked very finely- Daal Makhani could have been renamed "Heaven Makhani" it was so deliciously buttery and the lentils perfectly cooked- we ordered Butter chicken and Chicken tikka masala on 2 different days, but thought there was no difference in the taste. We might be wrong, but in any case, they deserved 5 star on our 2 evenings- Fish curry Amatsari style: discovered by surprise because we wanted to try something we've never had before: we have not been disappointed in any way!- Samosas and Naans were also a category even higher as anything we could have rated 5-star so far.For drinks we tried the Al-Jeera a slightly salty and spicy Cumin/Mint drink we fell in love with! It feels like you are drinking a liquid mint chutney. Addictive.Fair prices, very fast and friendly servic

Hi Everyone,I visited Khansama, after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and also through word of mouth, so I decided to have lunch there and invited a couple of friends to join in.We placed our orders and to our despair were served stale Cottage Cheese Tandoori ( Paneer Tikka) and Under-Cooked Chicken Platter. We requested the Arrogant waiters to look into the same but seems there attitude towards customers isn't right and they left us a deaf ear and brought the bill.Its shameful that after paying a hefty bill they never bothered to even fix our dishes.My Rating : 1/2 StarAvoid this place at all costs.
5
Took parents in law there; tikka chicken and butter chicken were outstanding.
Did not expect such quality at reasonable price.
We will be back!
4
went there late at night, had the daal (lentils dish) ever.
asked the staff for a not too spicy mutton dish and her recommandation was on top.
the naan are fully loaded with goodness and well done.
4
If anyone wants to experience the real taste of Punjabi cuisine then he must plan a dinner at this place. Food is just awesome and not overpriced. I truly recommend the place for dinner or lunch. I frequently visited this restaurant with my wife.
4
On holiday in Singapore and had really good lunch here whilst exploring Little India. Atmosphere was good, service good, food great.
5
One of the best Tandoori restaurants in Little India, consistently great food, prices are very good, and have a big variety in vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Great ambiance, service and friendly wait staff. We will be going back when back in Singapore
4
The Indian food here is mainly north indian punjabi food. It is good. We tried butter chicken. Dal makhani and alogobi with nun and roti. It was tasty and reasonably priced.
5
This small restaurant, located midway down Serangoon Road, opposite the Hindu Temple in Little India is a nice way to enjoy some authentic Indian cuisine. We have used them many times, as we live in Singapore, and they never fail to impress. Best for Dinner. Prices are slightly higher than the usual Little India restaurants. They have tables outside along the sidewalk, and have managed to create a cafe atmosphere, most other restaurants in Little India fail to deliver. Their food is very authentic, not too spicy as they cater to many of the expats living in Singapore. You can enjoy an ice cold beer with spicy Indian food. Great combination. and you get to watch the havoc going on around you
4
The Indian food served here is of very good quality though it is expensive then the other Indian restaurants , the service and quality of food deserves a visit to this restaurant. That have a choice of open air seating and ac room as well. The tandoori items are fabulous. Quantity enough for two people if you are a normal eate
5
This review is for the outlet at 87 Science Park Dr. This is generally an excellent place for lunch, with their buffets serving near full-house crowds on weekdays where I have eaten on countless occasions. Last evening I had the opportunity of hosting several guests for dinner at this restaurant. The starters of various chats and masala papadam were excellent as were the various main courses we tried. Especially good was the tandoori broccoli. We also sampled the entire dessert menu, and were not disappointed. My guests who were from the UK and Hong Kong loved the good, saying it was the best they’ve eaten. I highly recommend this restaurant. Great food and ambience.
3
I had been to khansama restaurant a few times and have also ordered at home so I can confidently say it’s good indian food. The quality has been fairly consistent and good. However the restaurant has very very slow service and are very inefficient to manage if more consumers come on a night. I had this experience twice and after that I have decided never to visit the restaurant again. First time I went on a weekend with family and second time closer to Diwali and both times it was horrible experience. On Diwali time after waiting for 45 min we got a table and we thank the staff for the same but it took more than an hour after ordering to get our food. Worst of it the staff at first floor particularly the manager lacks courtesy and doesn’t believe in talking to customers properly. I would still say the place has good food and hope they learn how to manage efficiently.
5
One of the best restaurants in Little India. Reasonably priced. Gr8 variety in veg and non veg. Good quanity of serving and well priced.
Gr8 staff which is very friendly and flexible to serve you food the way u want it
4
Chiken tikka and chiken tikka masala as well as chicken korma were very, very good with garlic naan and saffron rice. Butter chicken a bit too mild, but I guess that how it should be?
3
Strewth!! Maybe we’ve been unlucky, but having now been to two of the top curry restaurants in Singapore, we’ve not had a meal that’s better than ‘average’ yet. Maybe we’re just lucky to have so many good curry restaurants in the UK...
5
Nice and beautiful ambiance, great food, both open and closed seating available. Quality and quantity both upto the mark. Value for money. As there tagline says probably the best north indian restaurant in Singapore.
4
Seated fairly quickly, wait staff were good. Ordered onion bhaji- crispy, flat and not oily, tandoori chicken- really tasty and big portion, garlic naans- good size and chicken tikka masala- slightly too salty but still had good flavours.
5
This place is about a 7 minute walk from the Little India MTR station in Singapore. You walk through amazing shoppes on the street before you arrive. We were lucky and it was close to Diwali when we visited to everything was beautifully decorated.Our food was unbelievable and good portions. Enough to keep you entirely full! We ordered Paneer Tikka Masala which was spicy but nothing unenjoyable, as well as Shahi Paneer with 2 butter naans, 1 basmati rice and 2 King Fisher (large!!) beers and our bill was $60SGD. Cheapest beer we’ve found in Singapore too! Can’t go wrong with that! The staff was happy, friendly and our food came out in under 10 minutes. A gentleman who worked at the restaurant offered to take our photo for us for our memories as well, it was really a wonderful experience and we are going to order delivery from there tonight before our early flight in the morning. They deliver to Marina Bay Area.The menu is extensive, 20+ pages and has so much to choose from even though there is no beef or pork which is fine with us.Definitely visit this place if you’re an Indian food lover in the heart of Little India, Singapore
5
Excellent Indian food. This is not the very best I've ever had, but its easily better than 75% of what you'll find. However, what stands out to me is the sheer size of the menu. I've never seen such a diverse variety of options.For the price, this is very hard to beat. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Little India.I was lucky enough to sit at a table close to the edge of the restaurant, under a fan, and watch the world go by. A delightful time overall
4
A north indian restaurant right on serangoon road opp veer kaliamman remple, you wont miss its employees inviting you to the place for a mealIt has open air seating downstairs and indoor airconditioned seating upstairs, it serves north indian food.The food is tasty, and its not totally budget price. you are paying the price of what is expected in an average restaurant in singapor
5
After walking around Little India to find somewhere for dinner we came across Khansama Tandoori Restaurant. What a treat! It was all we were looking for and more. We couldn't eat all our food but gave it a good try. There was so much food and it was all very tasty. The service was excellent. We arrived early but lots of people obviously knew its reputation as it soon filled up
5
We dined at Kansas Tandoori on a Thursday night and had the absolute best food and experience. Open air on a street corner in Little India, chaotic, lively, absolutely authentic Northern Indian food. Their chicken curry sums it all up, fragrant, not too hot but strong flavours, with great Naan bread and washed down with a couple of Tiger beers. Heartily recommended for any traveller to Singapore, could just be my second favourite Indian in the world after my local in Thundersley, Essex. I'm coming back every trip through Singapore, Maralyn also loved it and that is an achievement
5
Was walking around Little India and dropped in for a beer and snack. We had a half serve of Chicken Tikka which was so tender and tasty. We also had the vegetable samosa which was also very authentic. Nice local vibe. Great service.
5
For our first foray into Little India this restaurant won our hearts...and stomachs! Mixed chicken tikka entree sensational flavours and chicken Manchurian amazing! Seriously worth a visit!
5
We went for lunch and had a delicious meal. Butter chicken was sensational with a really lovely smoky flavour and a little bit of heat. Really good sized portions (we definitely over ordered!) and friendly staff. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for great Indian foo
5
Found this place near to our hotel, so glad we went here! Very tasty food, we had chicken kebab masala, mushroom paneer, rice and a garlic naan along with Kingfisher beers! Curry was really tasty, we eat a lot of curry in the UK, and this was up there with the best. Definitely recommend this place, you won't go wrong
4
After finding this place from TripAdvisor we stumbled upon this restaurant located on a corner of the main road and side st. It appeared clean and organised with many workers who spoke English well. We ordered mutton and chicken with naan. The food was absolutely delicious and I would recommend this place to any traveller! Only down fall was it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive, but worth it!
5
Walked past one night and went back the next after reading a review. I had the chicken tikka for entree which was perhaps the best I've had (and I've eaten a lot of Indian). I followed with the mutton Rogan Josh which was nice and spicy. A reasonably priced meal and a lively venue- I really enjoyed it
4
On our last night in Singapore we ventured into Little India to have a look around and have dinner. There were quite a few place to choose from and we had nothing to guide us other than a "gut feeling". This place was busy which is always a good sign and we were given a take-away menu as we passed by, so we were able to look at their food offerings without feeling pressured. After deciding that we would eat here, we were quickly shown to a table and given menus. The food was delicious: in particular the vegetable samosas as a starter and the butter chicken as a main course, best I've tasted. We ordered far too much food and ended up leaving some, their portions are generously size
5
I have been visiting Khansama restaurant for last fourteen years and have enjoyed every visit the best food available in Singapore. I like sitting outside near the road and enjoy the crowd. The choice is unlimited. Everything is top quality. The owner is always there talking to customers and looking after the operations. The price is very decent and quality perfect
5
In search of good Indian food, we came to this restaurant! Initially hesitant, we thought of settling for basic option of dal. To our utter surprise, food tasted awesome!! Service is quick and food is yum! Staff is extremely warm and helpful.When craving for Indian food, this is the place to be! Singapore mein Indian food khana hai, toh sirf Khansaama pe aana hai!!
4
We were walking down Serangoon Road looking for somewhere to eat and were shown the menu by one of the staff standing on the footpath. After reading the menu we decided that this was the place for our first Little India meal. We weren't disappointed, it was everything we had hoped for. A nice cold Kingfisher to start things off before our food arrived. The dishes arrived quickly and were good sized servings. We enjoyed both dishes very much. Give them a try it's definately worth it
4
Less authenticity happening now as it's much more busy from all the tourists. Many tables on the pavement which is annoying
Wife likes the chickpeas and tandoori chicken
5
Open till late hours, friendly staff. Must eat dal makhani, biryani and aloo mutter. Everything we ate was very delicious
4
Located in Little India Khansama is a nice choice for having Veg and Non-veg Indian food. But it is little over-priced in comparison to the service they provide. We had to wait for 10 mins just for a water bottle!
4
After hearing good reviews my friend and I visited on a weekday night! We ended ordering too much food and were so full!Had a white tandoori chicken beautifully roasted, as well as roasted paneer which was so delicious! We also shared naan and a portion of butter chicken! The food was very tasty and authentic according to my indian friend and we were so full! Would come back!The staff were also very friendly and a gentlemen who helped us take photos did a very good job taking from many angles for us! Thank you
5
After staying in Thailand for a few weeks I was looking forward to some different cuisine in Singapore. We were handed a menu as we walked past and once we'd finished our souvenir shopping we headed back along the street and were greeted by the guy who had given us the menu. We chose mixed seekh kebabs and a chicken curry with naan bread and samosas. I am from the UK where we have a lot of Pakistani/Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants and so am hard to impress when it comes to flavours from the subcontinent. However, the depth and subtlety of the flavouring of the kebabs and the curry was a very pleasant surprise, I enjoyed the mint yoghurt dip too.The portions were a good size and my only regret is that we could not return to sample more of the menu. We will most certainly return next time we are in Singapore
4
Ambience: feels somewhere in India.obvious besides they create little more desi looks. distinct and visible. Food: chicken tastes so good. Except tandoori chicken . I don't know how it went wrong. Price: it's premium can't judge it.Buffet on weekdays u can avoid if u are looking something great. Ala carte mughal style dishes is tasteful. Service no complaints
4
Had a really good cup of Massla tea- spicy, milky and hot. We ordered the panir puri. The puri was nice and crispy but the rest of the dish was ordinary. The piping hot Somasa was really good. Freshly fried, good stuffing and crispy edges. Served with the chutney it was a really good accompaniment to the tea. SD19 for 2 people not really the cheapest but satisfying. Place was clean and comfortable. Service was good.
5
My husband & I went to this restaurant when we were in Singapore last month. I was searching online for good restaurants in Little India and this place was recommended. I am so glad we went there because the food was absolutely delicious! Really authentic food with so much flavour. I would recommend the prawn entree and lamb bhuna! The staff were friendly and helpful too. Highly recommend this restaurant
5
Went to Khansama after having received several recommendations from Indian friends. We were not disappointed! The food was amazing. We had amongst others chicken tikka, dal makhani, butter chicken and potato curry. everything very tasty and rich in flavour!The service was also good and whilst we were eating, the staff entertained our 7 month old baby - she was totally amazed by the level of attention she got and we were enjoying our delicious food in peace. Will definitely come back! Thank
5
It is located in Little India and accessible by foot from the MRT station. They serve very nice indian food. The naans are very soft and moist. You would like to try the butter or cheese flavour. You can have it dipped on their curry and other sauces. Curries are a must try here depending on your preference. The price is affordable and the meals would satisfy your taste buds
5
Authentic Punjabi food, perfect, very tasty indeed. This definitely one of the best in Little India Singapore.
3
I visited this place on recommendation of young kids...not a good place for me. Chicken tikka was hard non chewy..dal Tarka was good and so was the tandoori roti.
Staff is good except the chicken tikka did not match my liking
4
I ate dinner here one night and it was delicious. Just sorry I wasn't staying in the area longer to be able to dine there again. My requirements for a gluten free meal was expertly met, with full understanding of what was safe for me. I started with the Hot & Sour Vegetable Soup, "yum" then had the Fish Curry and the Mixed Vegetables. This dish also included a good amount of paneer cheese. Both dishes were perfectly well spiced and balanced with just the right amount of fire and heat, as well as being of a good size. The decore is nothing outstanding, but certainly was made welcome and well looked after. If I'm in Singapore again, will definately dine there again. Their menu is very extensive. Highly recommended
3
My family (two adults and two teens) visited Khanasama Tandoori Restaurant on Sunday evening. A friendly man ushered us in off the street with the promise of great air conditioning (it was!) and yummy food (it was!).The restaurant is obviously popular with locals and tourists alike as there was quite a mixture of both.The menu is extensive, and we enjoyed our food, although we found it rather expensive in comparison to similar places in the area.Unfortunately, the very friendly man who ushered us in downstairs was not representative of the staff upstairs who served us - those men were unhelpful and not particularly welcoming or friendly. I'd have preferred to sit downstairs where we felt welcomed
5
When in Singapore you must try this restaurant. Best Indian food I have tasted in a long long time. Be careful the portion sizes are quite large and can be spicy. Just ask to keep it mild if you don't like it to hot.I will be going back again next time I am in Singapore
2
We went because of the good ratings and we where very tired to go for another place. It was a mistake. The food (3 out of 4) was good but not really special. Prices on first glance ok but side dishes are very expensive. 6.50 SKD for one ratio rice is unreasonable! In total dinner for 4 (4 main dishes plus 4 drinks) for 105 SKD is for the quality way to much.
2
My family and I went to Khansama for dinner believing the many rave reviews.We were directed to the upper level dining hall. The place looked a bit run down and cramped. Though there were many tables available, we were offered a makeshift table. When we refused and started to move off, we were called back and then offered one of the available tables. Very bad first impression.We ordered Chicken Tikka (Boneless) and Mutton Sheek Kebab for starters. Chicken Tikka came with a big bone. Sheek Kebab was overdone and slightly burnt. The cauliflower was missing in the Gobi Manchurian with only flour mostly. It was a tad too salty. The meat and the curry did not blend in the Mutton Rogan Josh.Overall, a very disappointing experience. I would not recommend the place to anyone. There are far, far better North Indian restaurants in Singapore
4
One of the best North Indian restaurant in Singapore!Whenever we decide to eat out or even plan a party, Khansama is always considered.My recommendations...Start with a masala papad ;)Starters.... are usually good .Chicken tikkas, achari tikkas, mutton kebbas etcMain course...I like the parathas they serve. Especially if you are ordering for a party, go for parathas instead of normal tandoori rotis.Graveys are also decent, I don't have any personal favourite. Biriyani..not exactly their forte. Opt for Jeera rice and Daal Fry instead.Sweets....KheerGulab JamunGAJAR HALWA ( MUST HAVE)Excellent place to eat with a large group and maybe a little too noisy to have a quite dinner.Overall, the place is like a reliable buddy whom you can always count on.

While we were strolling through Little India, we were looking for something to eat. We were a little off put by some places as we were flying out the next day. First warning was having a man stand out the front begging people to come and try the butter chicken. It not a meal we ever order anyway as we know there is much more to Indian food than butter chicken. My husband said that he recognised the name of this restaurant from strolling through TripAdvisor and that it rated good. So we decided it would be ok. We ordered a chicken korma to share with some naan. The curry was a few pieces of chicken in a sauce that just tasted of only cream. Not what I have come to experience as korma. The naan was burnt but it was okay to eat around those parts. When we left, the place was full of tourists and no locals to be seen. A few days prior we enjoyed an amazing night at another Indian restaurant but this place left a bad taste in our mouths.
3
Having read so many rave reviews, we were excited to go to this restaurant. The dishes were fab although not nearly as cheap as depicted in many reviews. We did over order and I guess this could have been highlighted by the serving staff who weren't friendly
5
Friendly service and the tandoori is fantastic. We had tandoori chicken and the prawns both brilliant. Chicken tikka, rice and the best naan (flaky and crisp).
4
Food was good, not great. Prices are mid range. Sweet and salty fresh lime soda mix was much too salty. They almost forgot to bring cucumber raita and we received it after we had eaten other food already. 4/5 as the place met our expectations.
5
Great dinner with 4 kids from 10 to 14. Perfect.
Very good and nice service.
And the food is really excellent ! I was also there in September with an Indian friend and he confirmed it's excellent.

It was our daily dinner place during our one month stay in little india. We tried almost every dish. All the dishes were tasty and mouth watering..
Service was good. Staff is very friendly. They make friends on very first day.

Recently visited this restaurant with high expectations .Took sometime to explore their big menu.- Asked them to serve water in the process of selecting items from menu.- Given order.. no issues with taking order- asked them again to serve water because it was not served earlier.- Waited and waited.. asked again for water . - Frustrated and Lost patience and went to the counter and asked for the water and drinks that we ordered.- Finally drinks were given and after few minutes again reminded to serve water. I don't know if they had issue with serving water.Never mind, the food was served and no issues with the Taste, look and feel. Everything seems very good as per order, except one item for which they apologised that it is not available.Very stuffy on level 1.. difficult to move chairs.. very heavy.Mid pricy but I am ok to pay since the taste was good. I will not forget my experience of getting Water served very late since my full family were starving for water for long time.May visit??? may not visit again.. :-) I wish all the best for this restaurant

Wandered around Little India and saw this place - I had been planning on going to the chapati place across the road, but had no cash and couldn't find an ATM - so I settled on this. Sat on plastic chairs on the street it wasn't fancy - but I did really enjoy the food.Had a large (650ml) kingfisher and ordered Chicken tikka, rice, Mutton Vindaloo, and a garlic naan bread. All was excellent - the beer was very well priced at $8.50 a bottle, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. With a bill of well under $50 I really couldn't complain at all

Just returned from this restaurant and wanted to review it right away. This is some of the best Indian food I have ever had! We ordered the chicken Tikka starter, mixed chaat, mixed raita, mutton kabab masala, saffron rice and garlic Naan . Every single dish was excellent. First time for chaat and didn't know what to expect. It was delicious - garbanzo bean flour balls and wafers in a sauce that was both sweet and savory. And it was a cold dish so it seemed to be more like a dessert to me.The chicken Tikka was cooked to perfection and the mutton dish was spiced well, hot enough to warm your mouth but not so hot as to interfere with the flavors of the sauce.I highly recommend this restaurant and will surely return before I leave Singapore.

The story how they got me in the retaurant:---————--When you pass this restaurant, there will always be someone trying to call you in. I passed, on the way to another restaurant. They stopped me and told me to eat there and have butter chicken, I said no. And added that I am vegetarian. I kept walking. They stopped me again, told me, they had vegetarian food, too. They said they were the only restaurant in Singapore offering 10 times the money back if I am not satisfied. I couldn't really believe that, but I thought ok, if they are bragging that much, maybe the food is good indeed - they said I should look it up online but I currently don't have a smart phone. I answered no, I didn't want too eat there, and that it was too expensive for me. In the end they convinced me to stay by offering me to have a meal for the money that I had in my pocket, which was 12 Dollars. That was still more than I was planning to spend for my dinner that night (I planned 8 in a different place), but ok. I wasn't sure whether this was some kind of marketing strategy and what I would get for 12 Dollars.The food--———--After ordering, I realised that I should tell them to make it less spicy because they won't think of that themselves (I am European and too much chilli is bad for my guts and kills the taste for my tongue). So, I found a waiter and told him.Later, I got the food. It looked quite good. The taste was really ok, rice was good, naan normal, nothing special, and the cheese in the palak paneer was super nice.But it was too spicy for me. There was also some weird kind of flavour in it, it tasted a bit burned. I didn't won't to complain about that, because It could be a special Indian spice that I haven't tried yet despite the fact, that I am eating Indian food every day and cook Indian food myself, but I am not Indian. I also missed some salt, which is not a problem because I could have asked for salt.Change request badly fulfilled-——--So I requested some cream for the palak paneer, because otherwise I couldn't eat more of it, my tongue and stomach were already burning.It came back, less spicy. After a few spoons I realised that it was really greassy and the spinach was swimming in oil! It was a bit too salty now, too. I stopped eating because it was really disgusting. Also, the burned taste was much stronger now. I told the guy who had pushed me into the restaurant, that the food was too oily now and a bit too salty as well. He ran away and started some conversation with some other waiter and I was left alone.The discussion--————--I was still hungry and ate some naan, then I went to the waiter and asked what we will do now, because I did not like the food.So, a discussion started. The 10-times-money back promise was, of course, a lie (I never expected that money, I just didn't want to pay for food that I couln't eat because it made my stomach feel bad).They turned it around that I should not have eaten any of the food if I didn't like it, that they tasted the food and it was not too salty and before also not too spicy and also that the amount of ghee in the dish was normal after reheating (it was extremely oily! Before the change it wasn't!). They denied adding ghee and salt (it wasn't salty enough before the change! Now it was too salty!) - but I couldn't either see any added cream. They also said, that I had told the waiter too late that I didn't want it spicy and that the food was already prepared at that time, which wasn't true. And that they were doing me a favour to give me such a discount and that I shouldn't eat in such a place if it was beyond my budget. I rather felt like I had been pushed into the restaurant and pushed to spend more than what I had planned. They also said that they were the best restaurant and serving hundreds of people per day without complaint and that I couldn't have everything according to my taste if I was in a different country. I said they had promised 10 times the money back if I wasn't satisfied, a promise that I was not expecting to be fulfilled, but I didn't want to pay 12 Dollar for that food because it made my stomach feel bad, and offered to pay half of the agreed price, but they were too proud to take such a small amount and let me go without paying. I even wanted to offer 8 or 10 Dollars, but the manager didn't let me speak anymore, so I left, hungry

Located in Little indian the restaurant offers a great experience to enjoy amazing food while you sit on the terrace of the restaurant.
Service is efficient and food choices are all you can ask for and more :)
3
Overrated for the food quality. I expected authentic North Indian cuisine but I found it rather bland. With them renovating the place, it's in a slight mess at present. With a 120$ bill for 4, one can find better places to eat.
4
The hotel offers a great variety of Indian food. Of you are a food lover, then it's a very good place for you. Taste of the food is good.
4
Chose this restaurant based on reviews here and the fact that it was very busy. Great food and service!
3
On the corner of a road off Serangoon Road you will find this traditional tandoori restaurant. It was recommended to us, and we weren't disappointed
The food comes in huge portions, so be warned. Don't order too much!
4
They have delicious tandoori chicken and samosas too. Was craving for Indian food and was not disappointed. Staff very diligent and professional. Would come back again again. Great place if you appreciate good Indian food.

This is an honest place serving good North Indian food at a fair price. Unlike many nearby rivals it seems to use good quality ingredients.The pepper mutton was tender and the prawns succulent. Jugs of Tiger beer helped wash it all down.A small criticism was the Naan which was a bit chewy and undercooked.The mixed chicken tikka to start with was outstanding and should not be missed. Cheerful service in a casual setting make this one of Little India's best spots.You must book at weekends
1
I was at Khansama couple of days ago . Honestly this place is seriously over rated .You will get hawker centre standard of sitting and service for any good restaurant prices .Waiters will put the dishes on table as if they are doing us a favour, and if you ask for water , they will give you a bottle of mineral water which is added to the bill . As for my personal experience, since afternoon I ordered Chhole and 2 bhatura ... no drinks . ( later I had to find out they have charged for mineral water ) , to my surprise my bill came to S$18/- which is way more expensive than any 5 star restaurant. They had charged for chhole separate and bhatura separate. LOLWell , have decided not to go there ever again 
4
This place is dimly lit, almost like a street dhaba in the Little India area. We tried butter chicken, naan, roti and Jeera rice. The taste is authentic, and the price is not too bad. (the south Indian restaurants around are a little cheaper though and you can alternate between the two cuisines

We visited singapore on our honeymoon and decided to go visit little India and this was one of the top rated indian restaurants there. We had booked a table but when we arrived they gave us a make shift table on the street corner like hookers lol. It was very uncomfortable and an akward small table. Everytime vehicles turned the corner and people walked past we felt like we were just in the way and being looked at!We were told as soon as a table would become available they would move us to an actual table. Despite the restaurant being full with no available tables, the hosts were still trying to attract more diners and offering them tables somewhere where they could have placed us instead! we had to remind them that we were still waiting on a table! Eventually we were given a table inside the building and upstairs where it was still baking hot but atleast we weren't sitting on the street corner! The food however was yummy and affordable! And I can say I didn't have a dodgy indian food belly the next day :) which is always a plus!
4
Very dimly lit & weird decor. The service was very slow. But the food was very nice.
Almost like dhabha style food you find in india.
5
Not anywhere on top restaurants to dine in on trip advisor but worth a try
Loved mixed platter (entree) and pepper chicken breads were thin n crispy
Service was prompt was to full to try deserts will be back for it
4
Tandoori Chicken and Fish Curry are two of the dishes that you must order. Tiger Prawns are always fresh and juicy.
Chicken and Mutton Dum Briyani are some of the dishes that will definitely your taste bud.

Called in here whilst on a shopping trip to little India - nice venue sat outside.I had the mutton kebab - honestly am not sure what was wrong with it but as a regular curry lover this was way too spicy was like swallowing molten lava!! Inedible! Apparently all their kebabs are marinated for a day but tbh it was stupidly spicy!Wife had mutton saag (spinach) and that was a decent portion and delicately spiced so top marks for that. Had butter roti which was also very good - I asked for water due to the hotness of my kebab / didn't expect to get a bottle of mineral water that I had to pay for tbh as normal Indian places provide a jug of free water.Masala tea to finish was nice - of my kebab was edible I'd have give it five stars - waiter clocked I couldn't eat it and merely laughed! Either snide racism or a funny sense of humour am not sure.Reasonably priced but I'd wished we had simply gone elsewhere which I did across the road to get some actual edible food!
2
I have been with my family in this restaurant based on the positive comments on Tripadvisor. Unfortunately we cannot confirm these positive comments as our dinner was rather regular and the Chicken Tikka I had was not good at all. The Naan bread took ages to be served. The Lassi drinks were very good though.
4
Indian food we ordered was delicious .However , service can be improved a lot .Bit costly for the quantity they serve .The attenders need to be more friendly (welcoming ) . In such a lavish restaurant , one surely expects tissue box atleast on the table 
5
Thanks fellow reviewer's after walking around little India put in restaurant's nearby and liked the reviews at this restaurant. Amazing Indian flavours and big variety. They don't serve beef or pork but they serve everything else including lamb, chicken and seafood. A must go to if in area
5
Read the reviews here so we had to try it! we had dinner with my husband and cousin, ordered different things and could not remember the dishes names except for the rotis and butter naan, the taste was amazing! one of the best indian restaurants we have tried it was definitely worth the travel to little india, it wasn't as expensive as other restaurants in Singapore, even the beers are a value for money, they do get very busy for dinner so make sure you get there early, the staff were all very friendly as well, next time your in Singapore make sure to visit Khansama! Highly recommended
5
As a UK ex Pat with some Indian dining experience, I can honestly say that this restaurant has the best curries north of the South Pole!The service was top class, the food wonderful and the prices just right.We dined upstairs and the place was packed by the time we got to leave, I will be returning to this venue again before then end of our Singapore Trip, there is downstairs and outside dining available too. My daughter is vegan and enjoyed a superb DallThe restaurant is also tastefully decorated and furnished
5
I'm breaking my rule by writing a second review for a restaurant. If you love Indian food and you find yourself in Singapore, don't miss the opportunity to visit Khansama.Forget the slightly tired decor, and the occasional surly waiter. The food is just spectacular! I'm not exaggerating. My favourite Indian food anywhere in the world. This visit we had Butter Chicken, Chicken Kurma, Aloo Jeera and 2 garlic butter naans. Washed down with a large bottle of Tiger and water. S$56 total. Fantastic value for what I would consider Indian fine dining.
2
The food was great, it was made fresh and tasted great but the service was quite honestly horrible. The reason we believe that the restaurant deserved a 2 star rating is because although the food was close to amazing the service was bad and service is a great influence to how we felt the experience was. The waiters would pass us and not acknowledge us when we were raising our hands and such. They neglected to take our order for a good 10-15 minutes. Not going back
5
I sat down here on the spur of the moment back in 2012 and recall it being one of the best Indian meals I had ever had.Being back in Singapore I just had to see if my recollection was correct.It was.Magnificient chicken tikka masala and naan. The cucumber raita is a must to balance the spices and it goes great with a big bottle of Tiger.Highly recommend for quality food in the heart of Little India.
5
Wow this restaurant is amazing! We sat outside for lunch one day and we were not disappointed.We had the popadoms for starters and for main lamb rogan josh, chicken jalfrezi, a small plain rice and a garlic naan bread. All where delicious. We have never had a garlic naan as nice as the one from here. All staff where very attentive and accommodating. We will be returning on our next trip to Singapor
5
This place had some excellent Indian food, so much that we had guilt for leaving what we didn't eat. This is essentially a corner cafe not to different from a majority of these at each corner of the intersections of Little India. Plastic chairs and standard affair, you don't come here to be wow'd by the decor, you come here for the food, and it delivers. The staff was courteous and prompt, it has my favorite tagline (on the menu) of all the restaurants in Singapore, which is "Probably the best Northern Indian food in Singapore". I would have to agree
5
5 stars review for this place! We went to the upper floor for lunch. We Tried different naans with mutton curry, chicken and paneer. Food and Service was good and place was clean and not too loud. I love the design and the little bells on the chairs. We got vey decent prices as well. I wish i could return to try more dishes! Also they offer some kind of anis candies that you can try on your way out. Its hidden in a little ja
5
We found this place by accident after having a walk through Little India on a busy Sunday evening. We sat in the upstairs section of the restaurant. Service was fast, food was superb and the price was reasonable compared to other places in Singapore. We will visit again if passing through Singapore
5
We've been to this nice restaurant during our Little India visit and will definitely come back if we are again in Singapore.We had Butter chicken and Gobi Manchurian together with Cheese Naan and we were stunned. Taste was amazing, best Indian food we've ever had
4
This place was buzzing at street level when we arrived (a Monday night), but they ushered us upstairs where we were only one of two parties, so the atmosphere wasn't quite the same. DÃ©cor was typical heavy ornate Indian style chairs and carvings on the wall. It looked a bit dated and shabby, and a lick of paint would have gone a long way. Our starters were chicken tikka masala, pappadum with tomato, onion and spices on top, and cheese kebab. To be honest this would have almost been enough to serve as the main, so we were reasonably full before the mains came out. I would recommend just getting a selection of entrees to share instead of ordering mains.The menu itself was more akin to a phone book than the typical menu, Gordon Ramsay would probably have a fit if he saw how many items were in there. It was reasonably well structured into the main food groups (chicken, mutton, vegetarian etc) so it didn't take us too long to decide our order.We ordered three different mains (Butter Chicken, Chicken Mughlayee, and a Mutton Rogan Josh). Unfortunately they had run out of chicken mughlayee and without consulting us first, they served us two butter chicken dishes instead. The meals were great, but it would have been nice if someone had asked us first if we were happy to have the butter chicken or something else.All meals were delicious, and none of our party were left wanting. Pricing was quite reasonable, staff were obliging, service was efficient and we were satisfied. If we are ever back in Singapore, we will definitely go back and hopefully get a table in the more vibrant downstairs/street level area
4
We were three big guys who had dinner here and for a total of 95 SGD we had more than enough. Everything was delicious but the mutton biryani was heaven. The butter chicken was, as weird as it may sound, a touch heavy on the butter. I warmly recommend this place
2
I have been to this place a couple of times and experience had been pretty much the same. Their service is good, but I think food is just about ok. Ambience is good, but this restaurant fails to win your heart in terms of taste. I found some food was served fresh while some was not for eg butter milk was a bit sour. When requested to replace, they smartly tried to change flavours by adding sugar and black salt. It was a bit downer. They serve veg, jain with limited options, non-veg and hard drinks! Price is also on the higher side and not worth the overall value that you get.
5
Stumbled on this restaurant after hours of walking around Singapore. So glad we did! The chicken tikka masala is the best I've ever had. It's a great place to stop after shopping and have a beer and some grub. Great place!!!!!!
5
Solid quality North Indian food, maybe among the TOP 5 Indian joints in town. Never fails to satisfy ..
5
Went three times over a week. Butter chicken is amazing, you'll easily get a couple of starters and curry with garlic naan, rice and a beer for about 20/head. Great and affordable
4
Decided to visit it for a good Sunday lunch.The menu had us drooling.......Eventually after lots of deliberation we selected an assortment of dishes hoping it will represent what the restaurant is famous for.The flavors were overwhelming, I just had to have more and did not know where to go next.There was a big problem!!! We ate and ate and even more. But there is a limit on how much food a person can eat and then there were still food left. I hope some poor fella got the rest as we saw a few haggard beggars on the street.I am delighted to learn they do deliveries. Instead of having "airport food" during transit, call the guys for a delivery. Im prepared to sit on a concrete bench to have another Khansama meal. Perhaps a smaller order this time
4
It is a nice place to eat Indian food when you are craving for it badly. We had been there for a lunch and had ordered paneer kadhai, naan, roti, daal tadka and jeera rice. It was tasty meal with a lovely touch of Indian spices. Do visit!
5
So good we went twice. First with my son then second helpings on our last night in Singapore with friends from St. Andrews. Onion Bhajias and mixed veg pakora for starters followed by butter chicken with saffron rice accompanied by naan bread washed down with pitchers of Tiger beer. Great food served on our pavement table watching the world go by in Little India
5
Navdeed handled me and my friends, mostly foreigners visiting Singapore, like champions. Because most people in my group never had really high quality Indian food, Navdeed worked with us to come up with a practical menu for a 3 hour meal for 22 of us. We could not have been more satisfied. Khansama beats out every great Indian restaurant in the US by far, even the ones with Michelin stars. Khansama competes on quality with some of the best in the U.K., and I challenge any to consistently find better even in India. The menu is also super unique with many traditional, modern, and rustic dishes. What is surprising that they have found a really great balance between their variety and ability to expertly make each dish. When you try something here, you may initially think that, "oh I've had this before," only to be surprised by how fresh and flavorful it is. They actually make their own spices and blends fresh which isn't surprising given the flavors and aromas.Regarding decor, I think it is what of the better Indian restaurants which a designer feel. You will find very little tacky amenities that typically find their way in many soulless Indian restaurants. This is a proper sit down place that you can come to on a date or with friends and family. I would improve the chairs upstairs as they are unnecessarily heavy and huge, but the place has a charm and ambience that matches the passion found in the food.Service is overall good, though I wish servers would be a little more passionate and animated. They are usually very attentive and receptive to feedback so I cannot fault them on service. Unlike many Indian restaurants, you can feel like they actually are empowered to make the customer happy.To conclude, Khansama in Little India is a treasure and worth the special trip. If you find yourself in Singapore, just go to Khansama....it really is a must!-V

When we first got there we received pretty surly service, but after we talked the servers' ears off, service got better...so that was good.Been to this restaurant a few times over the years and the tandoori is okay, if a little dry...if you're going to Melaka...save your money and go to Pak Putra for Tandoori.The chicken korma was a real surprise though--it had a nice sweet hazelnut taste--which should not work, but was delicious in the Singapore heat...we were actually not recommended by the staff to try this dish for some reason...but it was the best dish we tried.The naan, rice, and tandoori were pretty average and the total bill added up to over $50 sing/cad/aus for 2....would I consider this good value--no, not for lunch--but everything has gone up in price in Singapore over the past 5 years.Our tandoori was not made to order and I would only go back if I needed tandoori chicken and could not get to Malaysia
4
Everything we ordered was well spiced. The paneer, the dal, both delicious. Good naan too. Ok service and a bit pricy, but most things in Singapore are pricy.
5
Soooo spicy but so good!! Was good service and quick! Had a mix of everything and all of it was good, but very very spicy
4
During a business trip we went here to have indian food. We really enjoyed the papaadums and the garlic pranws with saffrane rice. I think I have to come back here!
5
My partner and I were heading to Little Indian for a meal and this restaurant was recommended by our Taxi driver so we decided to visit.
It was brilliant, the food was authentic and full of flavour. We both loved it.
4
Menu is too large for me, but food is OK, meat a bit dry, but it was tasty and good seasoning. Good indian restaurant.
5
Whilst visiting the Little India district in Singapore, we came across the Khansawa Tandoori restaurant in Serangoon Road. We decided to have a meal and were very pleased with our decision. We sat outside and ordered our meal with the help of one of the attentive staff. We didn't want anything too spicy and we advised the chicken korma and Malai chicken. The quality of the food was excellent and much appreciated as was the friendliness of the staff - there was a torrential downpour and thunderstorm as we ate, but the staff ensured that we remained dry..!
3
I ordered, Papad Masala, Plain Naan, Masala Tikka Chicken, Aloo Gobi & Bindi Masala. I expected much more from the food quality at those prices. The service was inattentive & very slow... One waiter actually made it seem to us that he was doing us a favour to take our order. The food portion was good, the taste was ok -- I've had better. But it had a very thick menu. So maybe others, who go in bigger groups & try a wider array of food would be better judges of the food quality.
5
This was the most delicious meal. Great service as well. A group of 4 we had, Butter chicken, chicken masala, mutton rogan josh and the most yummy garlic cheese naan. A meal that was very reasonably priced. 5 stars at a bargain pric
5
The food was just outstanding! Probably the best Indian food ever, and I've traveled around - also in India. Superb samosas, excellent tandoori chicken, great lamb, mouth-watering black lentils, just to mention some. The service was smooth and it's a good idea to sit outside. Inside, upstairs, there are no windows and no air-conditioning. I can warmly recommend this restaurant. You won't be disappointed
4
We are pure veggie. Me & my wife just got out of little India MRT & were searching for Indian Restaurant. Suddenly a person come in Front of us & requested in Punjabi to try their food. We were not sure but also were hungry and the way ( confidence of the person) request was made, we thought to gave it a try and mind you food was really delicious with fragrance of Indian Spice. Thanks Khansama for Providing great service to people like us in Singapore. All male & Female staff there was Hindi/ Punjabi speaking and very courteous & friendly. I forgot the name of the lady from Mumbai. She was really helpful and tried to serve food as per our choice.Thanks to whole Khansama Team
5
Popped in for a few snacks and left so full I could hardly stagger home! Huge menu but staff made recommendations which were excellent. The butter chicken and Dahl were absolutely the best and I will be dreaming about them for a long time! Very good value for money! Restaurant is typically Indian with heavily wood furniture and bathrooms that could do with a refit!
5
We tried this restaurant by chance. As per previous review the butter chicken was excellent as was the poppadom . For those who like something mild try the Malai chicken. The sauce is made from cream and cashew nuts really subtle. We ate outside. The food was served piping hot and the portions were very generous. The naan were much lighter and crisper than those in the UK. A really good mea

During our last visit at Singapore we stayed at Hotel Parkroyal, Kitchener Road. The hotel is surrounded by many Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants. So people from Bangladesh love to stay in this hotel. Once we went to this restaurant for having tandoori chicken. We ordered for tandoori chicken, mutton kosha, fish. Mango lacchi of this restaurant is really tasty one. This hotel has two separate corners veg & non-veg. Foods are tasty enough with good service by stuffs. Price is also satisfactory..
5
My wife, teenager and I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking through little India. To our joy were greeted by attentive staff and amazing food all at very reasonable prices. If you are going past this place makes sure you stop in to enjoy a real taste of great curries, delicious Samosa and our favourite Tea Tariq. They also deliver island wide!! A real treat for travellers
4
The food quality and quantity is good But the food is bit spicy you have to tell them in advance if you want it less spicy They deliver the food to your hotel We ordered it from our hotel and they were punctual The rate are also ok
5
Having moved from Sydney we were looking for good Indian food and this restaurant was excellent, good was great and service was quick.
3
The food here is ok espl when u are tired of shopping in Little india and need a place to rest ur legs.The chair will be quite heavy to move.We had found this a bit not comfortable.But the food is very cost effective
2
Visited this restaurant with friends. Booked it for 12 seats. Though starter was good, it's really a cramping place, you can't move, even the servers feel difficult to serve the food. Price is bit higher side.Recommend management to make spacious seating arrangements
5
It's outdoor seating on the street, there's lots of action and good cooling fans overhead. We really enjoyed the food and sevice. This place also serves alcohol which was very welcome. We had achari tikka and murgh makhani both of which were excellent. The tadka dhal was complex and tasty. Naan and tandoori roti were a little small but fresh, hot and tasty-just order more as you need them. Value was good too
3
Husband and I were excited to visit Khansama for our anniversary. The customer service at the entrance was amazing but not so much once inside the restaurant. The guy who took our order was disinterested and aloof. He seemed more attentive towards other tables. Might be because we looked too South Indian (my assumption). Food was not fantastic as well. We only liked palak paneer, the rest were def not worth the money we spent. Vegetable fritters were a little burnt and 2 pcs were uncooked. Fish tikka was average. Kashmiri pulao was the worst. Dry rice mixed with tutti fruitti, nuts and raisins. No taste and it was super bland. :(Overall I wish we went somewhere else.
4
Had food here with one of our guest and the food was quite good. the tandoori is nicely made. food served hot
5
One can find authentic Indian food and items here. Famous for its non vegetarian items. You can't miss it out
3
Had a great Indian dinner here.
Went in at 7 PM and chose upstairs seating as it was aorconditioned.
Food was great and some items were quite spicy.
Had a mixture of some vegetarian with meat dishes.
Would definitely recommend.
4
Khansama tandoori restaurant . I had heard a lot so went to try . The food was super specially the paneer and pani puri . A nice place

After a week of mostly Chinese food, I was desperate for a good curry. So we headed out to Little India. I'd been researching good Indian restaurants in SIngapore in TA but nothing caught my fancy, so I thought let me follow my gut instinct. Thank God for that because I discovered this restaurant. For starters, the name appealed to me, and then I saw the chefs in the window at the tandoor - and I thought why not. Nothing pretentious about this place - it's simply an eatery. Apparently they have a restaurant upstairs but we elected to sit out at a table by the street. With my vegetarian partner, it's always a problem for me to try more than one dish as I sadly can't eat as much as I'd like to. Long story short, we ordered one saag ghosh or palak ghosh (however one chooses to call spinach and meat), a dhal and a bitter gourd dish (karela - something I hated as a child but which my partner absolutely loves) with butter naans and rice. I must add that I have developed this crazy method of judging north Indian restaurants by two dishes - butter chicken and saag ghosh. Don't ask me why but I simply love these two dishes and if the restaurant can convince me with these then I know I'll return. Although, I don't expect these dishes to taste the same in every restaurant, it's what the chef makes of them that tells me a lot. And also, I believe these are my two signature dishes as a cook so that's the benchmark I judge them by. The food came fairly quickly and one bite of the butter naans and we were both swooning. I cannot tell you how delicious they were. SImply scrumptious. They were light, fluffy, not as voluminous as many, buttery as hell and nothing short of to die for. The rest of the meal was going to have to deliver now! And it did. My saag ghosh was different but delicious as was the dhal (which I usually am not particularly fond of - you can tell I'm a real carnivore!). The karela was good too even if I say so myself but I haven't been converted. So long story short, if I visit Singapore again then I shall return, ideally with a group of non-vegetarians and try out the rest of their food. Highly recommended to all lovers of north Indian cuisine I'd say - even if based on just 3 dishes

Try the cheese naan, butter chicken, gobi manchurian. Been here for the past 10 years. The food is good just qty getting lesser. The dish holding the food gives you the illusion that its a lot but its actually very shallow. Wish they amend their ways. Otherwise I have yet to bring a friend who didn't like the food.

I stumbled across Khansama and was warmly greeted by a gracious and polite host who tempted me to experience this Punjabi haven. I sat outside and enjoyed the best lamb rogan josh I have ever had anywhere in the world. I would also recommend the romali roti. The food tastes like home and all the waiters are efficient and prompt. I enjoyed the food so much I went back two nights in a row. I was treated like an old friend. I can't wait to be back in Singapore to experience this delightfully authentic and good value north Indian cafe again

We stumbled onto this restaurant. What a jewel. The decor was awesome and the waitstaff was very friendly and spoke English. The food was absolutely delicious.! Authentic and Affordable

Business dinner with guest from overseas. We were seated on the second floor which was full at 8.00 pm.Typical Indian food. Great selection of Naans. Most of the curry dishes tasted (looked) the same, somewhat on the salty side, not super spicy but generally acceptable for the price range. We had some starters (normal) and several jugs of ice cold Tiger beers.Order taking and Service was similar to other Indian restaurants in the area, I do wish that the servers did speak some level of English (again this is not unusual). I comment them on the patience with taking our order as everyone on the table had the choice to pick two dishes.Overall, a pleasant dining experience

Went there with family after finding abt them on Google....coming to the review:-1. Location: right on the road...walking distance from popular "Mustafa" on Norris Rd connecting to little India main road2. Ambiance: my first dinner was on the road side seating...in sync with Singapore style...clean and good in a nice weather...the A/C dining room is there upstairs...nice Indian look..but sadly during my visit they were under repair3. Service: service around the ground level tables was good...little on the slower side when it comes to first floor...cannot make out the reason :( yes, the waiters might be little weak for the English language...but hey...u r going there for food...not English language classes... Indians on the other hand can freely communicate in Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi etc.4. Food:- coming to the main point...the food is really good...clean and hygienic...ask for spicy prep if you like it...my recommendations...tadka daal...if u r missing home... Other things I had were aalu ghobi( decent) , Shahi paneer( little on sweet side..good for children)... Crisp rotis where served ...though running service is slow...so order in advance....They also obliged us with ginger tea....which was a nice change.....The entire food will be little low on spices and salt...may be to suit everyone...so customize for yourself and enjoy the yummy food

The waiter didn't speak English. So another waiter/manager/who knows had to step in. The guy was quite rude from the beginning. My friend ordered a starter, man bread and a main course. I ordered a nan bread, raita to share and a main course. I asked how long we had to wait when it had been 40 minutes. He said: it's ready in one minute. The food took 20 minutes more. 1 hour in total. People who arrived 30 minutes after us got the food before us. The food arrived, but no starter and raita. He then told us they had sold out the starter. When we asked about the raita he said: Just start eating! You don't need raita to start. He was so rude. We thought about leaving, but we're not that rude. And then the waiter asked us if something was wrong. And we said yes. A lot is wrong. He didn't care about what we were unhappy with and we didn't get an apology. The last thing that happend was that he gave us the wrong bill. This was dining gone wrong. I don't know how the food tasted because it was a really bad experience.

During this year Diwali holiday me n husband visited the little india serangoon road, because of the advertised on tv we think we should try this restaurantBut my regrets its waste money But is terrible it so salty all the food we order all same we try to do complain but all the waitress n staff like very buzzy with their on. One lady waitress she can speak english OMG I see also a lot of costumer complain about very long their get their food n bad service My advice for this restaurant don't show advertise like big restaurant without your upgrade ur quality. With the competition around the Indian restaurant in that area I don't this restaurant can survived (my only opinion)
4
Good variety of indian food. Service is great. Full marks to taste. Spices are perfectly balanced. Rare to find such indian food in singapore.
4
Nice biryani, served with love. The chicken biryani with chicken curry and mutton b with m curry. Value for money place: both biryanis cost 10-12 SGD.
4
Really good North Indian cuisine at reasonable prices. The staff are friendly and the menu is extensive. Worth a visit if you are looking for something a bit more than the banana leaf / Prata restaurants that are prevalent in Little India.
5
India is one of the richest cultures in the world. Went to little India a day after deepavali to tour our sister in law when we passed by khansama resto. we had a snack. Just some naan, prata and buttered chicken curry and some drinks. their food honestly is a bit pricey but it is worth every penny. The buttered chicken is so delish. The cheese prata is really tasty. And the naan. Superb. if craving for indian food, will definitely be back here. Had to order another 3 sets of naan to satisfy our cravings. ;) - and i don't normally rate restos. ;
4
We ordered a pretty standard set of dishes, tandoori chicken, masala fish, lady fingers, raita, garlic nan black dal, and papadam. All were good. Since it was Deepavali service was a bit slow but we got what we ordered. Wait staff a bit curt, maybe from having to work on a holiday?
4
Was there last night and the food was just amazing. Tried the paneer and naan and it was excellent. The food wasn't very spicy which was good. Bit on the pricy side but if you are a tourist, it's something you need to try out!! Apart from the 15 min wait to get a table and then another 20 mins for the food to arrive everything else was fine.
2
It's a typical Indian restaurant in little india. Food is ok/good but overpriced (steamed rice S$ 5 !). The service was very slow and we had to wait over 1h to get our food. From the point we mentioned to wait more than 45 minutes service got very unfriendly. All in all: i wouldn't return to this place or recommend it to anyone
4
Important: They don't serve Pork or Beef.I had a wonderful meal here. Love their Bryani rice so much.Every time I pass by here the staffs will surely invite you to eat there.They have seating upstairs with air conditioning. They also deliver as well. Call 62990300 (10am-12:30am
4
I was very close to giving this 3 stars, but my husband convinced me that the waiters are doing their jobs by being so pushy - these guys are kings of the upset! I ordered tap water and was brought bottled; I'm a white westerner, and there were Indians who had tap. ;) Anyway, the food is really delicious, and the service is fast. One of the best options in Little India. The tandoori, in particular, is a stand out
4
Butter Chicken, Garlic Prawns and Mutton Curry. Add a basket of Rotis and we were good to go.The authenticity of the taste was something that will stay with me for sometime. The service was quick and prompt.The only reason I removed a star was for the ambience, I thought the lighting was just not enough.If you love Indian food and are in little India, make it a point to visit Khansama
4
Khansama Tandoori has large variety of north indian dishes with great and regularity in food quality. From tandoories to curries and briyanies, a large menu is available.
Located in little india, it has a nice terrasse to enjoy outdoor sitting. Definitely a good to go!
1
Worst service ,i asked for water 3 times but no one cares to serve water also.Service os too bad and food is not worth of price
3
It's Indian Resturant style having non vegetarian chicken, mutton,fish,prawns and egg
They don't serve pork or beef
They have kebab ,biryani and fried rice
They have hot line for delivery 62990300 from 10am- 12:30 mid night
5
Seriously decent food. Super delicious. The tandoori is so soft and moist. If you go there, have to bring your mate Greg with you though, he's the one who knows what the dishes are called so's to order. Too many choices.
5
If you are looking for an authentic tandoori chicken or nan or any good North Indian cuisine, this is the place. Very good service and located in serangoon road which is very easy to get by road or mrt
4
Enjoyed a good and very affordable lunch. Tasty variety and attentive service. A good option for indian!
3
I didn't have high expectations for the place with all the guys trying to pull people in off the street, but it was centrally located in Little India and we were hungry. It is fun to sit outside and watch the action go by. Service was a bit spotty - first dishes (tandoori) came super fast, but then big gap with out the naan, yogurt (needed for the tandoori to cut the heat) and other dishes. Asked for tap water and got a bottle instead. Tried to make us order more food at the beginning despite the fact that we only were able to eat half to it.Food was good to very good with nice seasonings. Tandoori chicken was great, as was naan. A bit overpriced though, for example charging $5 for simple steamed rice.Will probably explore other places before returning
5
We didn't get better food anywhere else. We ate our 75% meals here and loved it. May be we didn't/couldn't find any other equally good restaurants but this was our saviour. Delicious starters and main course all were good. We tried both vegetarian and non vegetarian and none left us disappointed.
3
After seeing this place come so highly recommended, and with little good Indian food available where I live (Siem Reap, Cambodia), I made the effort to go check this place out. The food was nice enough, and there was lots of it which is great for the quantity over quality kind of feast we all crave once in a while, but that wasn't why I was there. I had a far nicer meal at a lesser-known spot in the same area just days earlier at about 1/3 of the cost
5
Awesome Indian food! Loved all we ordered-- must try when you're in Singapore Go for the samosas, chicken kebab, chicken masala and again that cottage cheese thing which was the best dish during the meal ever!
5
Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a sumptuous tasty curry at a very reasonable price ...
5
what a great restaurant. spruiker called us in - bit dubious about heading up stairs, but once there our taste spuds were treated to an Indian sensation. The vegetarian kebabs were fantastic. Loved the food so much we went back three times!
5
And I don't say that lightly, having eaten in Birmingham and Leicester.
Service was great too, and we plan to go back tonight
4
Good food and good service. Outdoor seating added to the atmosphere of being in Little India. Plenty of activity going on around the restaurant.
5
I ate here three times and thoroughly enjoyed every meal.The chicken tikka was especially good and the breads very tasty. Great service too .Thoroughly recommended .
3
I have been coming here for the past five years. The food and service is fantastic. A very popular restaurant with both locals and foreigners alike. The restaurant is clean however the toilets are disgusting. I hope the restaurant management reads this comment and fixes this problem as it ruins a really great restaurant.
4
Khansama has become our go-to place in Little India and we enjoy people watching from the outdoor seating (as long as we're near a fan!) with the music playing to buffer the sound of the traffic. The menu is huge and everything we have tried in our three visits has been very good. We ordered sweet lime juice, cheese and garlic naans, papadums, daal makhni, mattar paneer, butter chicken and saffron rice and on previous visits we have had chana masala and palak paneer - all delicious! Service is always excellent, friendly and prompt
5
We chose to dine here based on reviews and close from where we are staying. The food they served surprisingly delicate and perfect taste. Little India area is hectic yet we were happy that we chose to sit outdoor and feeling the night breeze. Probably one of the best Indian restaurant we ever tried. And ladies, we warned you, all the waiters are beautiful gentlemen. *wink* We might come back for another menu and big beers
4
After a long and tiring day at Legoland at across the border .. We touched down at Khansama .. With the only hope that we want to have some good appropriately made "butter chicken"..and Khansama didnot disappoint at all !! We had a lovely time .. Lovely food .. My kids loved the place too .. Thank you .
5
Husband & I went here late on Sunday evening (9:30 arrival). Sat outside with plenty of fans so nice temperature to eat. Little India is a busy place so you do get to see the world pass by at a fast pace. The service was great & food fantastic. Paneer tikka our favorite, could almost become vegetarian. Washed down with Kingfisher large beer. All up less than $100 for the 2 of us that was 3 large beer bottles, 2 main curries, 1 starter (the paneer tikka), 1 Roti, 1 naan, 1 pilau rice, raita (yum), plus we had pani poori to start.Will definitely go back when next in Singapore
5
They have bar counter that can serve my cocktail. I saw the sign for good value of buffet. I will bring my friends there next time. Service is excellent.
5
I have eaten here literally 10's of times and their food is just over the top authentic. I love to home deliver their food. They have very good tandoor items and desserts are also very delicious.
5
Excellent service, had lunch there and food was very nice and fullfilling. This place is located on the corner street in Little India. It has a very good menu and the tandoori dishes were excellent. Highly recommended.
4
Overall very good food and enjoyable experience. Service very friendly-- food quite good. Vindaloo a bit disappointing.
5
Awesome lunch real Indian taste 😋 good presentation and very best in price my family really like it
4
I ate here twice during my recent trip to Singapore. This brings my total visits in the last three years to six or seven, with all but one eating outside. Why do I keep coming back to this place? The quality of the food. It's very good. The owners are Punjabis (my peeps). They cook my faves very well: Amritsari fish (fritters); mutton kebab; malai tikka; paneer tikka. The breads are very well made. They have a huge menu, I've probably only tasted 5% of the dishes. They have beer in big bottles - the perfect accompaniment. I always leave this place full and happy and looking forward to the next visit
5
This restaurant sits on a street corner in Little India. It offers great Tandoori food, so stick to the (boneless) Tandoori chicken dishes. I've had the skewer, which means that the chicken pieces are placed in a nice, but extremely spicy (!), sauce. If you can handle it, you will truly enjoy it. You will eat simple, good, but not cheap
4
In the midst of Little India is Khansama restaurant where we were able to have a peaceful afternoon meal. Starters were tasty and freshly prepared and the mains ordered were ample such that reluctantly they were not finished ! As tourists, perhaps the service could have been a bit more enthusiastic seeing as we paid $100 SGD for food and drink for 3 people. Recommended nevertheless for quality
5
Love the food here! we are returning customers, and whenever we have visitors, we'd bring them here! Please be aware thought that Khansama has another restaurant in Singapore, and there the food doesn't taste the same, not nearly as good! I highly recommend the Khansama at Serangoon Road
4
They cook on demand so it makes food better but service a little slower wich was ok for me as it gave me time to watch people go buy...I ordered (by reccomendation) a 5 chiken pcs degustation... 5 different flavors woth naan bread and indian beer for approx 30$... wich I find cheap for Singapore!I reccomend for lunch if you are nearby
4
Humble place, humble service. Good Food (8/10)- especially Biryanis are very tasty and value for money (Chicken- 9.50 SGD, Veg- 9 SGD, Mutton- 10.50) with enough quantity for 1 person.
3
A good Indian restaurant, specializing in North Indian dishes. Offers tasty food at slightly above average price.
Food service maybe slow and restaurant may get crowded. Ambiance is too dark and lighting is dull.
4
What a wonderful surprise we stumbled across in the beautiful India sector . Must go here , upstairs is a treat of amazing cultural antiques and atmosphere. The drinks are cold and the staff are warm and helpful and smiling.Wow they said may be best Indian in SgpCertainly the best I've ever enjoyed so many fantastic choices and flavours , served with tasty side dishes and brilliant presentation,, lovely appealing well priced menu ,, we are hard to please and this restaurant is Top

I went to the Little India branch for a birthday treat from my friend on June 2.Everything was going on fine, food was served quickly and was good too. However, lo and behold, a cockroach scurried across the table, making me jump up in fear and disgust. Staff who attended to us did not even ask what happened and didn't react when I said there was a cockroach. Eventually only when we told a manager, he apologised for it. It's left such a bad taste i don't think I'll ever return there.
1
My girlfriend and I went there for lunch today. We have already been here a couple of times in May 2016, the food was absolutely delightful. But today, it was different. Things have changed. First, the menu is new, which was a good surprise, the old one was quite oily and in a bad shape, old. Some items have been removed, and prices have risen. Anyway, we ordered our favorite half-chicken tandoori, fish Amritsar curry with naans -- cheese & garlic, and plain. Second surprise came when the waiter brought our food. The chicken tandoori portion was way smaller than our previous visits, but still as tasty. Another disappointing surprise, naan breads were also smaller than usual, by half their sizes!!! Food is still very good, no doubt about it, but portions are smaller and more expensive now. Despite that, we gave them another chance by ordering additional dishes for our dinner. The takeaway portion was even worse, the butter chicken was too salty, and my cheese and garlic naan had no cheese at all and was even smaller than the one I had for lunch, just like the plain naan.. I no longer can recommend this restaurant to anyone
4
We visited this place 3-4 times during our stay in Singapore. Overall, the food is good with some dishes exceptionally well and some not so much. Their Dal makhani is very good while malai kofta is bad. Aloo parathas with curd is a great breakfast option.Service can be improved
4
For the food a definitely go, however the staff can do its best more often. It takes quite a while to get their attention and drinks. Food doesn't come at the table at the same time what makes it a little bit annoying when you have your tandoori chicken but nothing to eat it with
4
We went to this restaurant twice and loved the food. We went to their upstairs dining area and did not eat outside next to the road. The place was crowded both the times and the waiters were friendly.The variety in both veg & non veg options was quite elaborate.The only issue was Air Con wasn't good enough both the times and when we complained, they politely replied that it's at minimum temperature. The service was quick. There was nothing exceptional about the ambiance and there was nothing that we disliked
4
A resident friend insisted we eat here... I have to agree the food was good.The surroundings were rubbish - literally. A rubbish cart drove past doing their collections as we ate on our pavement table.... and one of the waiters followed along spraying his can of air freshener....The toilets were very basic. The wine was surprisingly good.The bill was cheap, and we ate our body weight in food!If you like basic and eating with locals, then go
4
We went to this restaurant twice in our short Singapore trip. First time we came across this place while searching for a good Indian restaurant for take away. The owner is very soft spoken. He suggested very good vegetarian food. The order took a little longer than normal but we loved the taste. We had forgotten our backpack there, fortunately I had got there menu so I called up and they kept our bag securely.Next day we all went for lunch there, had a satisfying and delicious lunch and tool our bag.
5
Very Much Indian restaurant in heart of little India.Food was authentic Punjabi and a very nice environment.Go for first floor seating.Cant get better than this in Singapore for lovers of Punjabi Indian food.
5
Located in Little India
Seating upstairs
Tandoori chicken was delicious
Butter chicken was very good
Dum chicken Biriyanni tasted authentic
Naans were fresh and warm
Affordable, tasty food in modest surroundings
As a fellow Indian I must say the food was delicious
Will return.
4
The food was very good indeed, lots of variety and very tasty. The location is right on the street so don't expect a peaceful romantic dinner!
2
I have frequented Khansama many times, mostly at their Science Park branch. This review is on their Little India branch.When I placed my order, I reminded them not to make the food too salty as and to serve the tandoori fish at the same time as the other main dishes. In 5 minutes, the tandoori fish arrived and it was way to salty. It then took another 40 minutes for the other dishes to arrive which was unacceptable.When the wait staff were reminded to check on the dishes, one of them gave the curt reply, "coming," while the others couldn't be bothered. Although the food was finally served, I swear that I will never frequent this place again
1
Long waiting queue. Once you sit they misinform you on the serving time. Don't even consider coming on a weekend...they can't manage the guests
4
I've been here with my family in June 16. It's a mid sized Indian restaurant at the heart of little India... looking for good Indian food as fed up eating hot dog and burgers after spending huge amount. I was recommended by one of my friend. It was great experience.....tasty Indian food from chat papri to butter chicken and best place to have it. Service: Good...good staff and their hospitality.....Overall Experience: Great Indian food away from India. Love to come again and taste dal makhni....
4
Located on the main serangoon road in one if the corner..with a loud punjabi music on the ground floor and peaceful sitting on the next floor..nicely managed with quick service..being a veggie..we ordered hara bhara kebab which was spicey and hot with chilled beer..and for main course roomali roti with daal makhni and paneer kadhai..good in quantity for 3 pax 2 main course dishes are enough..mid range good indian restauran
4
craving some good north Indian food and some friends took me here. this place is the real deal. We ordered some kababs, with good old Scotch, goat meat/mutton bhuna and something else I cant recollect with real tandoor roti. meal was so good I ate the same thing again after a couple days. I would go there again, for sure
4
Good restaurant. Weekday buffet is fantastuc. Only complaint is the mutton. Lamb is served instead of goat. The dishes are meant for goat meat and not lamb meat. Anyways, chicken dishes are excellent. Chicken pulao is my personal fav. Wraps are a bit pricey. Tandoor items are great value for money
4
I've been here twice, in March & recently on 07-June with my family. It's a mid sized Indian resturant at the heart of little India, the taxi drivers can find it over google map or you can use the MRT & walk down to this place. I'm wary of eating Indian food abroad as its often "fake Indian" food by that I mean the kitchen is run by Nepali, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or to put it people from Indian sub-continent other than India. Often the food is anything but Indian, at best an imitation of Indian food. Khansama is not such a case, this is a true punjabi food place. Pls note, if you are a south Indian food lover this is not the place for you.Food: We are a Indian family (from north of India) with a very strong taste of flavor. My wife is vegetarian and my daughter only prefers Indian food, while I'm an non-veg. We ordered for chicken tikka, dal makhani, paneer butter masala & naan. During my first visit, I had mutton saagwala & dum aloo. The food is as authentic as it gets, I strongly recommend the dal makhani & dum aloo. Their breads are absolutely excellent and you have a good experienced hand running the tandoor.Service: Average. I wish they smile & greet you. Though they get the order right & place the food on your table.Decor: Now this is confusing, a north Indian restaurant specializing in punjabi food has a completely south Indian decor. It looks dated & I think they can go for a complete revamp. Overall Experience: Great Indian food away from home. You can safely trust them to dish out genuine Indian food each time
5
Khansama restaurant is one of the best restaurant in Singapore which serves the best Punjabi delicacies . one must go there as the food served is fresh and the service is also very good . good luck!!!
5
We always love the food at Khansama! (Not recommended for people that can't handle spicy food!) The service is good but the food is just great.
Huge variety of food, including vegetarian meals.
4
I am regular visitor of Khansama restaurant on Serengoon road. Lot of variety of Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian. They also serve liquor. Dal makhani is must try in vegetarian.
4
Super sexy Indian Punjabi food. Went twice fir dinner...best tandoori chicken in town. .. All Indian staff. Punjabi music..lovely food.
4
Chicken Tikka and Kadhai Chicken is extraordinary. Paneer Tikka is equally good. Ambience and service is average.
3
We spent a Saturday night wandering around Little India and settled on this restaurant for a meal. It was really busy and almost all the tables were occupied. We were outside on the pavement and it was good to watch the hustle and bustle of the locals. Our drinks order was taken promptly but after that the service seemed to disappear. We waited ages for someone to take our order and once it was taken we waited and waited, and waited for our food. When it finally arrived the waitress explained that they were exceptionally busy but that excuse didn't sit well with me because there were people who sat down after us and got their food before us. Anyway, we tucked in to our meal and it was nice, nothing exceptional (which is what I was hoping for from the Little India district) and to be honest I found most things unusually oily. It was an experience and Iâ€™m glad we went there but I can get a better Indian meal back home in New Zealand
5
We visited this restaurant in April after reading previous trip advisor reviews. I have to say, we were not disappointed!The food was fresh and very tasty and the staff were all very friendly. We had been looking for a decent restaurant to eat at since we arrived in Singapore and this was one of the best that we came accross. The prices were very reasonable compared to other indian restaurants in Singapore, would definitely return here
4
On our first evening in Singapore, a friend took us to Khansama Tandoori Restaurant. Since she lives in Singapore we went along and said "ok!" and we were so happy we went. We were seated outside on the sidewalk, and enjoyed watching the evening unfold. Ordered a couple of Kingfishers, a bottle of water and food. Onion Bhajia, Chicken tikka masala, Kashmiri naan, Mixed Tikka ( fantastic flavors) Bindi Masala, vegetable biryani, and mixed raita. Really good food, all served with a smile. A fun place for eats. Just be warned it is spicy and it is hot, but well worth the "pain"
4
Had a lovely experience at Khansama. Ordered Breads - Garlic Naan, Tandoori Roti, Butter Naan and Stuffed Tomato curry. It was creamy and delicious, though I tasted a spicier version at a different place. This was a surprise and nevertheless enjoyed thoroughly here after a busy shopping in Little India. It's a bit costlier considering the Little India standards but a real good treat even for Vegetarians.Food - 4/5Ambience - 3/5Service - 4/5Overall - 4/
4
On the last day of our Singapore re-visit, just shopping in Little India, a gentleman was standing outside the restaurant giving out promotional leaflets. OK it was lunchtime, we were hungry so in we went. Upstairs to the air conditioned dining area and seated. Started with a nice cold beer, studied the menu and ordered. Our food arrived and how delicious it was. We have eaten in many Indian restaurants and this is right up there
4
It was a delight to make a quick stop and try out the local delicacies - tandoori fare in particular, rice dishes and the desserts. They even do home deliveries.
2
We had memories of great food with Khansama Science Hub branch. However, our visit last evening was a disaster. We ordered, Malai Tikka, Tangdi Kabab, Dal Makhani among other things and they tasted pretty awful. I'd probably never go back again.
4
We really enjoyed this restaurant in "Little India". Chicken Korma, Daal Makhni, and their special Chaat dish were excellent. Slightly expensive but we would certainly go back. Rest room was not so clean, though expectations may vary.
4
200 rupee or similar and visit here. The food is amazing. Taste, taste, taste... It's budget dining with a much higher Resturant experience. Simple but bursting with flavour
5
We came here after reading a food blog - and we were really pleased with the meal. Chicken Tikka Masala was extremely rich and smokey- it was actually one of the best we've ever tried. Palak Paneer was great too. Roti and Naan arrive warm and crispy. Overall, we had a great meal
4
We have eaten at this North Indian restaurant twice recently and on each occasion with different friends. The food is great and it feels a very authentic Singapore eating experience sitting outside under the five foot way. In particular we have enjoyed the mixed tandoori chicken, the vegetarian samosas, the black lentil dal, the vegetarian curry, the delicious cheese naans which are so tasty and light; and the saffon rice. Really cold Tiger beer is available as a glass or in jugs. There are so many restaurants to choose from on the Serangoon Road but give this one a try; it's a very good bet
4
We visited previously and knew was a good stop so ventured for a cold beer on a steamy day. Naan bread was lovely. The beer was very cold and refreshing. The skies opened shortly after sitting down which saw a cool change but lasted only a moment and the steamy Singapore returned - the beer was still cold! Is a good place to visit and welcoming.
3
The food wasn't awful, just about average, but there is far better available and at better prices. Costs around $30 per person which isn't great by Little India standards.Toilets were revolting, which makes me question the hygiene level of the kitchen. Seemed to be hundreds of waiters with many of them standing around staring.Mostly for Western tourists. Go somewhere else in the neighborhood
4
Visited khansama along with friend who is staying in singapore.. He took me here.. And we were seated on top floor.. Starters chicken lollipop ordered and came quickly with Tiger and Kf.. Ordered butter chicken with garlic naan and food was delicious.. Service was fast.. Ambience dimlit with dark black red colour.. Walls.. Liked the setring. Prices were moderate.. Quantity was fulfilling..

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service extended by the staff. We had 3 dinners out of the 4 nights we were in Singapore at Khansama. Their menu is elaborate and we tried quite a few dishes during our meals. The food was consistently good and we highly recommend it for great food and prompt service !!

The veg north Indian food was way to good then expected. Service is very good. Worth going if you are craving for vegetation north indian food in singapore.
4
Dont fool yourself with the exterior and interior. Take a seat at the street and order some chicken kebab, chili prawns, naan or something else. Tasty and as spicy as you want it. S$ 50 for 2 should cover it. Service ok, free wifi.
5
My 5+ Star Hotel Concierge suggested Khansama as a great casual place in Little India. Excellent advice. The food was excellent with just the right amount of spicy flavor. My main waiter, Venkat, was supported by an army of others. I have a difficult time recalling better food combined with such fine service. The prices were reasonable. They had Kingfisher in bottle or draft:-). I cannot wait to return

Pax- 6Place of delivery - ECP BBq PitOrder- Chicken & Veg Biryani, semi cooked tandoori appetizersThe delivery was made on time which was really important to us.The appetizers were well-marinated and semi-cooked as requested.We used the bbq to cook it completely along with some store bought sweetcorn.The Biryani was flavorful and tasted fantastic. A wonderful experience overall.Pros:Quality of foodServiceSpecial requests entertainedQuantityCons:A tad bit low on etiquettes (people shouting and yelling in the background while the customer is trying to get across the order

I have been coming to this place for years and it's truly good North Indian food. If you have friends coming, drop by this place, if you are craving for a great Chicken Tikka give it a go but get the bigger portion. This is yummy, full of flavor and great value. Their prawn masala is yummy and their butter chicken is good. I am going again tonight - just awesome food at a decent price with ice cold beer and waiters who remember you. If you see negative reviews of this place - you can ignore, the vast majority of feedback is very positv
5
Probably one of the best indian hotel in little india...we randomly chose the restaurant to have dinner and to our surpruse the food was excellent...proper dili wali dal makhni with authentic taste...i loved the food and the service was also good...aust try rest. For north indian foo
3
Decided to try something different as I usually dine at bare foot down the street. I had mixed Tika plate and saag cheese dish. Was fine, just not special. Service was not so good, as other reviewers have noted. This place is by far tourists, so probably more of a one time customer base. You won't be upset eating here, but probably not thrilled either.
5
When getting out of the MRT at Little India station, we have asked 3 pedestrians about a good Indian restaurant but nobody could help us. So, we were wandering around looking for places to eat. That is how we found Khansama. However, for the first glance, we did not feel that it was our place. Only when two American tourists approached us stating that they have never eaten such delicious Indian food, we sat down. And we did not regret it. The food (Chicken korma) came fast, it was great and enough. The mango lassi was also superb. Not to mention the price - which was pretty reasonable. OK, the view is not of top quality, but hey, we went there to eat. All-in-all, we had an excellent dinner there
5
If you are a vegetarian and travelling to an asean country & what more could have you have asked for if you find a place where you get good, tasty veg indian food.Service is good even if you check-in for dining around 11 @ night. They will put efforts to cook really good food for you. It is worth trying
1
Dont go here is you want a meal in a hurry or even a in a reasonable time.The service was appalling (over 1 hour for our meals to arrive of which I lost my appetite by then) and the delightful aromas of the garbage truck parked along side the restaurant for 10 mins whilst it was emptying bins was in fact the only highlight
3
This place used to serve great north indian food, however lately its not that good. The food quantity and quality has decreased quite a bit. The seating area on level 1 is quite cramped.
4
Dropped in for a lite bite after a visit to the Hindu Temple across the road.
What a treat. Really tasty and not too spicy. And very reasonably priced.
Was a pity we only wanted a little.
Definitely a place to return to
4
Authentic North Indian food in Singapore! Also got to have some Indian beer.Would recommend anyone looking to have authentic Indian food to check it out
5
This one of the best Indian food that you can get in Singapore when it comes to nann and butter chicken. The cheese nann are to die for! They got it right! We always go there when we have north indian food cravings. However do note that it's on the expensive side, we spend at least 30 bucks per pax each time
4
Our visit to this restaurant has been good. They have two places to serve food. 1. Street side2. A.C hallStreet side can be fun for casual dinners with friends.Get into the first floor to experience the AC hall well decorated with Indian mythological sculptures. This and the lighting, ambiance were the ones factors which impressed us more.Food was fine. Service can get better
4
Stopped in for lunch while touring Little India. We enjoy Indian cuisine and were delighted to get the real thing. Had the vegetable somosas to start--delicious and large portion. Shared the chicken curry and tandoori chicken both were very tasty and nicely presented. Service was good and not a long wait for food to be delivered to table. Definitely a solid yes recommendation
3
Khansama is good if you don't eat there too often. The food tastes great but is rich and laden with oil. There was some isssue with the meat a couple of months back. I usually stick to roti and dal and a vegetable. The staff is attentive and friendly
4
Just came back from here and had a really nice meal. I went for a dish recommended by the waiter which was a vegetarian dish of cottage cheese in a spinach curry sauce, it was something I've never tried before and it was amazing! I also had the black lentil daahl which was also excellent. My boyfriend also enjoyed his butter chicken and lamb curry. Oh and the samosa starter was top quality too.Service was friendly and helpful and the price was cheap! A glass of wine was $8 which I've not seen anywhere in Singapore yet!Great value option for a casual meal
4
This restaurant had delicious Indian food. We dined with a group of friends with 3 strollers and all managed to fit. Tables and chairs were large heavy wood and a little difficult to move around in the restaurant. Cost was a little pricey, but so is most Indian food world-wide, Little India is no exception

Called the restaurant Dec 31 at 2pm for a 7 — 7.30pm delivery as we were having guests over for dinner that evening; figured a five-hour head start should be, well, more than reasonable. 7.30 came and went… Called at 7.40 and was told "on the way." Waited, then called again at 8 and was assured "20 more minutes, maximum." Waited some more, till 8.30, and this time they tell us their delivery man was "stuck in the rain, cannot come out." Stuck where? "Stuck" is as helpful as they get, but another delivery man will pick up our dinner from the "stuck" delivery man and arrive in 15 minutes or so. Needless to say, our dinner did not arrive. Yet the restaurant insisted when we called that the delivery man was "downstairs" our apartment — but there was no one in sight, and no answer when we attempted the delivery man's handphone.By then the delivery was two hours overdue. Did it ever materialize? We don't know because — our dinner plans utterly ruined and ourselves completely embarrassed — we had no option but to take our guests out for dinner after all

Average food but deliver to your hotel below 50 sgd.
Paneer tikka ,we ordered was tasty .Other things were average .
They provide complimentary Onions with the food which is a plus point
5
you should try yourself without fear ambience good service good food quality good music air conditioned and open air dining experience
4
Visited this restaurant for dinner and tried different types of dishes. The restaurant is primarily good for punjabi dishes. Chat and chinese dishes are average. The service is good, the seating arrangement is nice. I would recommend this restaurant for punjabi and mughlai dishes
4
Lovely food and good service. Best chicken tikka masala I've ever tasted.
The place is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants in the area, but it's worth it in my opinion.
4
Its conveniently located in Little India . Few minutes walk from Little India Station. We love to enjoy Indian food and this place has amazing food to offer at very reasonable price compared to other restaurants. Good variety....
Dal Makhani is very nice :)
5
Place which serves Indian food which makes you feel like you are in India. Channa Masala and Dal Fry are excellent. Fish items can be avoided.
4
Going purely by the quality of North Indian cuisine served and price, Khansama is a top pick for North Indian food in Singapore. I've always lamented on the lack of authentic Indian food in Singapore, but Khansama stands out as an exception. What I appreciate more is the modest pricing - makes it one of the most value for money places in town.On the flip side, don't expect a swanky ambiance or a 5 star service. But, they make up for it with their authentic, value for money fare! Thumbs up to it
1
We were excited to check out this place last night, as it was the #2 ranked Indian restaurant on Yelp. After we had ordered our drinks in the nicely decorated upstairs dining room (with AC), I spotted a mouse scurrying under the table next to us. Needless to say, we quickly finished our drinks, paid, and did not order food. So gross.We told the waiter about the mouse, who decided to just hang out under the table (presumably waiting for his buddies). The waiter did nothing!!!If you see one rodent, there are undoubtedly more. I guess this is okat standard fir India but not acceptable in Singapore. Travelers beware
2
Food was tasty. However, the visit was marred by poor service. The server refused to offer gravy for our naan when we finished the gravy from our dishes, and insisted we order another dish. I'm sure there are better establishments out there serving the same or better quality food. Or hopefully they will improve their service
5
Most restaurants in Little India close for lunch and don't reopen until dinner around 6 pm, so I was happy to find this restaurant open at 5 pm. I was actually recruited to come eat here from a host passing out menus at the corner. The menu is quite extensive and it was hard to decide. I went with the chicken tikka masala with a side of rice and butter naan. Wow the food was delicious! The portions were large and I ended up doing taking half of it to go. I also had the dessert of the gulab jamun, which is like a fried doughnut ball in a sweet syrup. Highly recommended
5
We were suggested lot of places by many. Then we had suggestions from few local Indians and we were very happy with our choice. We really enjoyed good veg and non veg dishes.
5
me and my friends visited khansama 10 november 2015.Restaurent was quite good.Space was very big.staff was very humble.Now food was superb we ordered paneer butter masala mmmmuuuhhhhhhaaaa lovely very good keep it up.
4
Great Indian "street" food serviced on tables situated on the pavement. Was busy with both tourists and locals.
5
On the main road in Little India, it serves incredible Northern Indian food, and very cold beers.
A real find .
5
I have tried food at restaurant in Science park drive. was great buffet. Mango lassi is great. Also, buffet serve great food with delicious dessert. Mouth watering.
5
For me this is one of my top five Indian food experiences. I can be unimpressive by run of the mill Indian at times but this place is outstanding. Indian street food of the richest and tastiest quality. Cold beer and wine selection to accompany and served by enthusiastic and attentive staff.
5
One of the few places for authentic Indian food , much better than the over hyped usman restaurant , I would prefer this coming in from delhi , the staff was polite and suggested to my liking , the roti and naans were as they are served in delhi
5
Our favorite north indian restaurant in Little India -- excellent tandoori meats and breads, great curries, and a relaxed atmosphere -- the terrace downstairs is great for relaxed outdoors eating, and the upstairs A/C room has more decorations and is also very nice. Great service, and excellent food for a good price. In my opinion, better variety of menu options than some other restaurants that specialize more in being spicy than having a variety of different types of curries
5
Some people probably don't know how to order food if your giving this place a bad review, gotta stick to the basics. Chicken kebabs, fish tikka, palak paneer, butter chicken, and some garlic nans. Food was good, sat outside and people watched as well, has wifi as well as a bonus. Recommend this place for sure for your Indian fix
5
We have been to this restaurant several times over the years when we have visited Singapore. We have watched it evolve from bare tables and no decoration to the tables with cloths and statues of goddesses watching over you while you eat. On our first visit we asked the waiters to choose some vegetarian food for us. Obviously it was good as we have returned often. The food is delicious, ample and service is efficient. As the sign on their building says 'probably the best North Indian Food in Singapore'. We would probably have to agree
5
Stopped here because it had good reviews and it loved up to them~ we got the Mango Lassi, tandoori chicken mixer, mutton Rogan Josh, saffron rice and plain naan and prahta. All very good
4
Good food, been there several times and always consistent. Good to sit on the sidewalk - they're always willing to add a table for you if they're full.
4
Nice north indian food cooked and served by north indians. the taste is very close to authentic. as authentic as you can get without cooking food on wooden stokes (Bhaati). The menu is quite good and comprehensive and prices are mid range.
5
Seriously the best indian restaurant in Singapore price wise and also veg and non veg dishes went there all parts of the day and evening terrific service
5
Best punjabi food in singapore. The waiters are fluent in Punjabi Hindi n English and very friendly. A tad bit expensive but so are other restaurants in Singapore. Even plays punjabi n hindi music. Sit outside on the streets for the best experience for dinner time. We had 2 main course dishes with 6 rotis (wheat roti like India) rice 1 beer kheer n a milo drink n bill was 56 dollars. Worth the money definatel
2
After our first visit in September'15 we went there a couple of time for weekday lunch buffet. Yesterday, while we were there waiters served us warm water in transparent glass. My friend noticed how dirty they were from outwside with multiple finger prints clearly visible, Yuk..When we bought attention to a nearby waiter, he agreed to change glass but casually said "These are just finger-prints, pretty normal". Well hygeine level is questionable. Not sure what practice they have in Kitchen.Also, after several visits we have noticed that taste of food is getting average. Like yesterday sweet was "Carrot Halwa". It tasted artificial, looked like on top they have added some kind of syrup. Also, it was not roasted properly.With the exception of Aloo-Gobhi (Potato-Cauliflower veggie) ecerything else was prett ordinary in taste
5
They have 2 branches, one in little India and other near science park. If you are any place near these areas and wana try good Indian food (vege or non-vege), this is THE place u wana go to. They have never served me anything that i love less than 100%. My recommendations would be for u to try Kadhai paneer, dum aloo, daal makhni, naan, jaljeera. All said, they do screw up their quality sometimes when u get the food delivered, so check that
5
We chose not to enter this joint on first pass. Spruiker out the front handing photo copied menus with promises of deliciousness and value???? A recommendation sent us back and we were truly surprised. The food was knock out!An extraordinary array of Indian dishes are on offer and what we selected from the expansive list was so delicious , so authentic, freshly prepared, flavoursome and good value....loved it....and sort of sorry that we judged the book by the cover
1
They were caught passing off ( selling) beef as mutton.On a technicality they avoidedgetting jailed/fined.Stop patronising them after reading about this in the newspapers
5
E This is one of my family favorite restaurant.we usually go upstairs and start our dinner with pain puri . All the food items are with punjabi flavour so the food tastes very good .nan is also nice and crispy .in all a must to go and dine there 
4
Don't let the exterior put you off. Inside is good. The menu is pretty comprehensive, the staff are friendly and the food is really good. We all left very satisfied. Price and quality were matched well. Given more time I'd go back.
5
I have travelled all around India, eaten Indian food in the Middle East, been to all the top curry houses in London, Birmingham etc and this is hands down the best I have ever had. Truly amazing food.
5
Cheap and great food with good ambience and great customer service - what more you need. Thatswhy it is always full here. SO if coming in a big group, do remember to do advance booking.
5
I tried this place after long time and I was pleasantly surprised that this place has improved tremendously ... Food is really tasty and reasonably priced ...
One of the really good place in Singapore to enjoy Indian food @ reasonable price
2
We were sitting upstairs and it was quite dark and the airco was blowing exactly into out table. The service is not very impressive. Food was ok, but nothing extraordinary. If you are looking for an authentic Indian restaurant, I will not choose this one.
3
We've now been to Little India in Penang, Kuala Lumpur and here in the last two weeks. This place was recommended to me by a woman from Punjab- she said the people love it here.Most of the staff were ok. The guy who took our order was the friendliest and pretty good at his job as he managed to convince me to order extra bread and yoghurt!The Aloo Gobi was so flavoursome but should have been in a lot more sauce. It was very, very dry. As vegetarians we have had many different versions of this dish and it should never be dry!Not impressed when we paid. The waiter who took our money acted way too cool for everything. Slick, greasy looking hair and a lame attitude. He then had a full on 10 minute conversation with an Indian couple whilst we sat like lemons waiting for our change. I had to ask three times for our money. We eventually approached the counter to make it very clear we were more than ready to leave.The men outside were very nice when we left, asking us if we enjoyed our meal. The restaurant is beautifully decorated.
5
During my five days in Singapore travelled from Stamford Road to Little India four days to have dinner in this restaurant. Does I need say more. Very affordable place with authentic Indian taste. Kingfisher beer available. Will recommend to all my friends. Will visit again. They can deliver food to your hotel room as well
5
Went to Science park branch of Khansama. Heard that this branch is quite good but never tried before.It was simply the best indian food I ever tasted in last 10 years in Singapore.They had weekeday buffet lunch at 11.90++ and I was surprised at verities on offer.Good selection of food for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Tandoori potato with some spice was one of best appetizers I had followed by some Raita (flavoured yogurt) and some chutneys n salad.Few varities of Rice, tasted Jeera rice and was good. Had mix veg (not overly spiced, pepper chicken and mutton vindaloo.Naan and Tandoori roti were delivered fresh to your table.Now the best part, dessert of Chilled Badam Kheer (Almond flavoured rice cooked in milk) was out of the world and we had second servings. Fresh food, delicious and prompt service and not to forget the price tag of 11.90++, cant ask for better deal.Simply the best indian food ever tasted in Singapore. Highly recommended

We went to this place for dinner last night (Sept 4.2015). It was very busy but we managed to find a table to sat down enjoyed the Mango Lassi which was excellent. We order lamb Kebabs for appetizer. It was quite good which full of flavor and aroma. The main, we order 1. Dal - very good2. Chicken tikka masala - plain3. Palak paneer - very good4. Lamb Rogan Josh - very good 5. Saffron rice - nice and fluffy For drink was 2 bottles of tiger and Lassi. The bill came out only 90$ including GSt so we have to put 10$ for tip coz no service charge in this place. The services was very good. I called a few of waiters a few times and got very quickly reactions. They deserved tip. Also my hubby said he ate in other branch at 87 Science Park for Lunch buffet quite a few time coz it's close to his office. He said it was also very good there the price for buffet very cheap likes 16-17$. Too far for me to go check those lunch buffet out. I definitely return to this place again.
4
Restaurante well located in Little India. Food was good even though I have eaten better Indian food in other locations.Staff was really nice to us (we were sitting upstairs). Room is dark but we enjoyed the atmosphere exactly like that. In conclusion: not the best indian restaurant we have been but would certainly return if needed something to eat around their location
4
Very tasty Punjab food ...liked all the things. The dal Dhabi wall was too good but the lass had to be tastier . The ambience is nice
5
Foods there are really yuuummmy... especially the chats... we go there when we visit little india and feel like having chat! price is ok. Staffs are friendly. Not a halal restaurant as they sell alcohol but there is no pork or lard.
3
Since this was first Indian restaurant I tried in Singapore, I found it to be good but after some days when I tried other places like Ashok Tandoor & New Alam, I discovered that khansama was a very costly option for indian food lovers
3
The restaurant upstairs was dark and dingy, the decor tired and untidy. One of the seats at our table was ripped, junk was visibly and untidily stored above the bar. Service was inconsistent, we were waited upon by a variety of people and one our drink orders was forgotten. The range of dishes offered on the menu is so enormous it is almost overwhelming. It was so diverse I was totally indecisive as to what to order
4
I've been here a few times and never disappointed .I like to order a few small dishes and share and everything is served quickly by the friendly staff. Lots of aromatic flavours and herbs, not too spicy or heavy . It's a bit noisy outside but the atmosphere is great, I like to watch the street action . Inside is cool and elegant Indian decor for those more comfortable eating in a cooled place . Totally recommend
4
The food at Khansama (Little India) is always authentic either Veg or Non-Veg.We ordered Paneer pasanda along with Dahi Chicken (tried first time), Roomali roti and rice.Paneer was excellent, prpbably the best we had anywhere. Gravy was rich and sweet and paneer was fresh.Dahi chicken was ok, not worth ordering 2nd time. Service was prompt
3
Been here 5 or 6 times now. Naan bread amazing and tandoori chicken is fantastic. Had this the first few times with an ice cold beer. Service very good although a little pushy trying to get us to eat there. Tried a few other things on the menu such as the curries but they were watery and disappointing. Last time we stuck to the chicken as it really is good, as is the naan. Also last time a HUGE rat ran past our table (outside) and into the restaurant, but I guess it's the same all over Little India and many other places in the older parts of Singapore. Would still go back although what brought me to the TA site today was looking for a different restaurant to have Tandoori chicken at! This one was top of the list.
4
Straight to the point, if you are a fan of bharwa karela (bitter gourd) then this is the place to go!!! Khansama serves delicious north Indian food and no way that you will be disappointed though the service is little slow. We waited for almost 45 minutes for our order to arrive. The hotel has also the strangest ambiance and decor I have ever seen as it is a mixture (not blend) of rajasthan, south india, gujrat etc etc. Another thing which is not pleasant is that it is dimly lit even when the walls are of really dark color. But all things are unpleasant only till the point the gorgeous, delicious food arrives and leaves you lost in the culinary heaven
5
My wife and I were attracted to Khansama by a smartly dressed employee handing out photocopied menus on the street! Normally I wouldn't have even accepted the flyer, but the place looked clean and upmarket. We returned an hour or two later and were offered inside or outside seats. We chose inside, and were delighted by the plush furnishings and beautiful decorations. Service was prompt, polite and helpful. We waited 15-20 minutes for the food to arrive, which for us proved it was cooked fresh. We ordered Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Masala and Aloo Jeera, with a selection of naans, washed down with Mango Lassies. All were delicious. Just enough heat to make a point, without drowning the other spices. Nicely balanced. We shared a portion of Gulab to round it all off. S$56 all included, which I would consider reasonable for mid/high range. As we were leaving, the chap on the street checked if we had enjoyed the meal. Nice touch. All things considered, one of the best Indian restaurant meals I've had. We'll definitely be coming back
5
We found a wonderful restaurant called 'Khansama' at 166 Serangoon Road. We chose as they had an upstairs air conditioned very posh seating area. However we were very pleasantly surprised that the food was terrific and being from India, I know my Indian food - another added bonus was that our meal was cheaper than the UK too at less than S$20 for a main plus a drink
5
Had the best dinner there. Garlic naan was the nicest we've ever eaten. Chicken tikka much better than ours at home and the butter chicken absolutely superb. Would've loved to eat there again but only a week in Singapore! Highly recommended
5
Love the delicious North Indian cuisine at Khansama.From the Veggie baingan bhartha to the silky channa palak or rich dhal to the tandoor pomfret and the romali roti and delicious breads. The Chilli baji are worth trying too. One of Little Indias best restaurants
4
Consistently good Indian food in the heart of Little India. Great to sit on sidewalk watching the passing parade and eating great food.

This is one of the prominent Indian restaurants in Singapore situated in Little India : the hub of Indian population. This has enabled this restaurant to acquire an Indian surrounding , complete with the noise and the clumsiness outside. In a clean and organised city like Singapore this area is an island of untidy chaos. So the restaurant too reflects this spirit. When tables are full and some tables need to be rearranged to accommodate groups of various sizes , this restaurant very much resembles the chaotic scenes in Indian eateries at peak hours. The noise level too reflects this. But this is not a negative feature because the guests seem to expect this scenario. The food is really good which is the most important factor for the guests. No one asks the question ' why should we come to such a un-Singaporean spot when we have options of more decent eateries serving same food'. Indian food is best savoured in an Indian environment seems to be the guiding principle. To complete the picture , this restaurant also has spread tables at ground level on roadside. The main restaurant is on the first floor to be approached through a stair case. Images of Indian Gods and Goddesses adorn inside and outside of the restaurant
5
I was in Singapore on a day trip desperately on the look out for Indian food.I was lured into this restaurant by the Tandoori Oven.The waiter was extremely helpful, not friendly, but gave good recommendations for my budget.I ordered a saffron rice with butter chicken as he said it was the most popular and I could tell why, it was soooo succulent and flavoursome, creamy and rich.I had a garlic butter naan bread and a mango lassi.The naan bread was expertly cooked. I sat upstairs, it was very dim and regal with black and gold furniture, It felt a little like a dungeon and I felt as though I was being watched by the other customers in the restaurant as I ate. However the food was delicious and reasonably priced, I would recommend this restaurant but sit outside to watch the world go by, don't sit upstairs
5
We were recommended this restaurant by a family friend who lives in Singapore and it was unbelievably delicious! The restaurant is set in the heart of Little India and delivered one of the most welcoming, authentic and flavoursome Indian meals I have tried in South East Asia. The Menu is extensive and has something for everyone - we went for the Black Daal and Paneer Tikka Masala - both were authentic and very tasty! We will be back for more no doubt! We finished the meal off with a delicious masala tea and left as two very satisfied customers
5
Give the tourist traps in the malls a miss: this delight in Little India is definitely worth a visit. Easy to access via the MTR (Little India station) and the walk to restaurant with all the sites, colours and sounds of the neighborhood providing a great prelude to an excellent meal. Very reasonably priced and a really interesting menu of favorites as well as some new tastes. One of the more interesting areas in Singapore that is often better known for places with less character and charm
4
Seriously good Indian food. It is not very cheap, but very much worth a visit. In the heart of Little India, we sat upstairs which is air conditioned. We missed the buzz of the street life but is was extremely cool and pleasant. Chicken Tikka was excellent. Definitely recommended, and we would certainly return
4
Khansama Tandoori Restaurant is the perfect spot for a real Indian meal. The atmosphere is very relaxed, although the place can be quite busy. A member of the staff is always there to attend to you, very friendly indeed. My colleague and I visited after a busy day installing our stand at The Affordable Art Fair. Arriving just after 21:00, the restaurant was busy with many Indian families. I took this to be a good omen of what was to come. Amazing food and ambiance wide selection of very tasty food great service affordable. Happened to just see it, i wasn't really looking to eat but most restaurants there were empty and it was bustling so I went in and I was not disappointed.The two of us chose a chilli chicken, palak paneer, yellow dhall, mutton rogan josh, saffron rice, garlic & onion kulcha and a butter naan. What a feast! Each dish was really packed with flavour. Food was yum. Wish they are more spicy than it is. We washed our meal down with a jug of tiger beer to share. The restaurant attracts a mix of locals and expats and appears to do a good trade. The bill came to SGD 83.40 for two including tax but not service charge. No doubt you could find cheaper, but would it taste as good? Overall it was a great dining experience in a breezy alfresco seating. Price is not as cheap as expected but still very reasonable. I enjoyed it a lot!Would come again and ask which curry is the one that comes in the bucket!

This is the Indian restaurant to eat at! Its at Little India, the happening place. Well this restaurant is always busy, but once you get a table (outside), you just have to sit back and enjoy the food and the music. You are served authentic Indian food, with a very good service level. The Chicken tikka is great, so are the currys and the naans! The prices are on the high side, but I guess it is worth, compared to restaurants in Little India! Go for it!Six of us got a table outdoors, which was nice and breezy. We enjoyed -Pappadums - were crispy but a tad salty. Still enjoyable because of the whole black perrercorns.Non Veg Tandoori Platter which had an assortment of different flavours of chicken Tikka, Chicken Kebab, Mutton Kebab, Fish Tikka and Tandoori Prawns for $35. Value for money!Chicken Biryani is so fragrant and fluffy I took a few servings! And it was all gone before I could go for the second round. Absolutely delicious.Cheese Naan, Garlic Naan, Rumali Roti, Butter Chicken, Bhindi Masala all excellent â€“ as usual but I must compliment Palak Paner (cottage cheese cubes in spinach) which was warm and melted in my mouth, yummy!! And I was informed by the staff that the cottage cheese is daily imported by air from New Delhi.I must compliment Khansama on the impeccable service. Very attentive and accommodating. You might want to sit indoors at the second level if u prefer air conditioned dining. With a bottle of wine, bill came up to $25 each, which I felt was reasonable. We were all absolutely stuffed and happy

Stepped of a conference to get lunch in Little India. Fund this verry good little indian restaurant. Frindly staff, food came promptly, it was verry tasty not to spicy, reasonobly priced. Got the gajar halwa for dessert, it was excellent.
3
The view inside is pretty bad but food is good. A little over priced but good place to have a family time. Pretty crowded during holiday

Food served were fresh and very delicious. Restuarant's theme is fantastic taking you back to heritages. Paneer and chicken gravy were too good.

Had dinner at this restaurant with family. Food was delicious and mouth watering. The restaurant serves vegetarian and non-vegetarian Indian food. Ambience is very good. Service is very fast. Recommend this restaurant to Indians visiting Singapore and those who love Indian food.

I has my dinner today at khansama Tandoori restaurant and i have to tell you it is real delicious authentic Indian Food. Their chicken dum biryani it is very delicious and fragrant, and i highly recommend to have the biryani with mixed raita. You should try their chicken karahi and chicken tikka masala with paratha or naan. I highly recommend this restaurant

I have lived in Singapore for 3 years and have tried many North Indian Restaurants. This is hands down one of the best places for food, environment, food, atmosphere, and food. Khansama is in the heart of Little India located at the junction of Norris Road. It can't be missed as you will be approached one of the waiters with a printed home delivery menu. The staff is wonderful and the chef/owner often will come to the dining room to talk to the guests, explain his take on the foods, and recommend from the menu and off the menu if you so wish. In addition to fantastic non-spicy food, Khansama will also cater to your spicy side and add different levels of spicy "heat" to any dish you wish to your liking.When compared to some of the more touristy establishments. Don't be fooled. This place is amazing.Go there and then go there again and again. If you are only visiting Singapore, make this one of your dinner engagements. You will not be disappointed

Every time I'm back in Singapore I will always try to make it down for a meal here. Trouble is always to get a convenient parking close to Norris Road which is the cross street where this restaurant is located.Amazing butter chicken, and my favourite, the mutton biryani.It is not easy to gain such loyalty with a frequent traveller but this place has won my stomach over. Looking forward to be back again

We were in Little India in Singapore, it was getting late, we were tired, we were hungry and although this restaurant looked less than inviting we decided to give it a go. What a great surprise!  After initially sitting outside we asked to go into the air conditioned interior. We went up the stairs into a lovely room with ornate Indian furniture. The staff was gently spoken and very pleasant. The food was excellent and plentiful. The samosas were delicious as were the kebabs. When we left the staff kindly tried to flag down a taxi for us but as it was a one way street and we wanted to go in the opposite direction we were unlucky but they really did try. Would definitely recommend a visit
4
While I did my pre tour research on Indian Food in Sinapore, this restaurant didn't feature much in any review, So it was natural I avoided it in the first go. But when I was bored with the regular Indian available in a much hyped- low service restauran I thought to give Khansama a try and they did surprise the entire family. Khansama's taste is equivalent to best available even in India. Best part, not even taste, prices are even matched to Indian Standards.Go!! Just give it a try
4
The buffet at this restaurant in Science Park 1 is worth it.Usually one vegetarian item will be good and if you are lucky then both!Rotis are not replenished regularly.The soups are usually good.The restaurant has undergone some ineterior renovation.It is a family friendly restaurant.Food id Punjabi style
5
visit to Little India took us into Khanshama Restaurant. A couple of Tigers and a sample of vegetable pakora made our stop worthwhile. The staff were helpful and chatty. One had worked in Edinburgh! We shall return.
4
Order and eat without eating without thinking twice. The quantity is food and ingredients are fresh.
If you love Indian food, go here when you are in Singapore.
4
Service was slow.food was good . environment was good.menu can be improved.waiters standing at the roadside and calling customers looked cheap way of approach.should maintain dignity.
5
We have tried Indian food in a lot of places around the world, but this just made our day! Don't look for a view or style, but you will for sure eat one of your best meals that you will ever have.
5
I have been going to this wonderful restaurant for many years and seen it evolve, upstairs at least, from very rough and ready with Bollywood movies on the TVs, lovely views onto the streets etc. But the views are gone and it is a lot more sedate. That said, the food and service are memorable, and some of the waiters even remember the fat, sweating foreigner demanding yet another strong lager to go with the sublime chicken tikka, perfect rogan josh and garlic naans that should carry a health warning, they are so tasty. Don't try to kiss anyone for a week, and even giving the taxi driver instructions involves a fog of garlic
1
Been to this restaurant 3 times, and each time it just gets worst! To start with, while walking on the streets, a waiter will call you/ stop you and try to FORCE you to eat at this restaurant! Not too cool. Then once you accept to eat, you will be asked "Sir please give us 5 -10 mins we will try to get you a table". Then you wait for 15 mins, yeah! Once you have a table, you wait quite a long time to get the food, and its definitely not worth. Nothing like authentic food - just plain currys and I have the feeling that only the names are different but the spices/ tastes are all the same! Surely there are much better restos in singapore! Skip this one
4
This place shall score more on quality of service than quality of food .We decided to have a early dinner on on of the evenings and were humbly sold by the server on the serangoon road of Khansama.The inside restaurant was too cluttered thus we decided to sit out side as it was breezy evening .The Drinks were average as my beer was just cold enough but the fresh lime soda salted was absolutely flat .The Starters again were ok , although the main course with naan were well up to the mark in freshness and spice levels .The server was very courteous , but would I go again to the place . Might be because of service .Good Luc
5
A nice Indian restaurant located in Little India. It serves great traditional Indian dishes. Try their Chicken tikka, saag paneer, butter chicken, pappadums and fresh naan. My all time favorites. All dishes are very tasty and offer good quality portions. The good thing about this restaurant is the tables outside. You can enjoy the busy street life in little India. Summarizing I would say: Nice food and a good evening out with friends or family. Enjoy
4
After a morning wandering through Little India, this spot looked promising and reasonably priced. I'm not too well-acquainted with Indian food, so I ordered something I knew -- chicken biryani. It was delicious! After tasting the garlic-cheese naan, we had to order another. Everything was very fresh, and cooked with whole spices (cloves, cardamom, chilis). I loved the way the flavors danced in my mouth. We liked it so much that we came back the next day and had the same meal. I'm only giving 4 stars because the service is a little perfunctory -- not bad, by any means, but not exactly warm and friendly. But the food is the star, as it should be
4
This restaurant is located in Serangoon Rd in Little India. The stairs to the restaurant are dimly lit but upstairs is spacious and old world. 6 of us went for lunch and ordered chicken tikka and samosas to start and then half a dozen main dishes with saffron rice, garlic and cheese naan. All the dishes were delicious but some of the mains could have arrived a bit hotter. For the variety and quantity of food we ordered the bill was very reasonable and the service was very good. I would definitely go back
5
I am a big fan of Indian Cuisine. I tried their Rogan Josh, various naan breads and chicken tandoori. They were very delicious and rather affordable. Only drawback to this area is the difficulty of getting a cab late at night.
4
Nice north indian food (especially their dal makhni n panner tikka), reasonable rates. Easily approachable n a must try it out as its good.
5
I was introduced to this restaurant by a good friend and each time I visit Singapore, I must pay yet another visit. The quality and taste of the food on offer here is excellent....try Papadum Marsala, Chicken Tikka Marsala, Aloo Gobi, Cheese Naan all washed down with Marsala Tea. You will be in heaven and very happy to be there !
5
Really enjoyed the aromatic Chicken Biriyani, moist Tandoori Chicken and tasty Garlic Naan. The staff there were very neatly dressed and their service were rather good. The ambience on the second floor (with air conditioning) was very pleasant. This is probably the best Indian food in Singapore! :
4
This place served great food for an inexpensive price. If you like indian food you cant get disappointed. Also the waitor made good recommendations on what starters to get. Overall the service could perhaps get some improvement for a full score - they seemed a little bored and bothered at times - but food and value weighs up by far
4
We chose this restaurant off the back of other reviews / blogs and were pleased to have researched prior to hitting Little India (which is rather chaotic on your 1st day in the city).We dined in the upstairs area with is clad with wooden carvings and huge ornate tables and chairs. The menu is largely North Indian with a wide selection of both Meat and Vegetarian options to suit most.We opted for a couple of Samosas to start that were well spiced, crisp and served with a great green chilli dip. To follow we had Mutton Biryiani, Malai Chicken, pea rice and a Gobi Paratha to help it down. Again each of the dishes was well spiced, flavourful and a wonderful break from some of the mediocre curry we get in the UK.The meal came in at around $65 SGD and left the 2 of us stuffed. Service was friendly, food came promptly and there was a good buzz in the restaurant. If you are in Little India this should definitely be on your list of places to dine
4
As I had takeaway, I can't vouch for the service, atmosphere, etc. What I CAN vouch for is that this is really good north Indian food at a decent price. There are so many north Indian restaurants in Singapore, least of all in Little India, but so many of them serve generic Indian food (and, heaven forbid, you should try their buffets). The reasonably-priced a la carte menu at Khansama is quite a relief. The food was excellent, especially the spicy lamb kebabs
4
We have tried the food here for quite a few times and never get disappointed. Taste is perfect with right blend of spices .All the food items veg or non veg have a great taste, even the home delivery is pretty fast.Chicken tikka, butter chicken, rogan josh , mutton saag, dal makhani, kadai paneer all were really nice but we ordered chilli paneer and paneer had no taste as if just coated and put along with dry stuff and it was really spicy.Must try to enjoy North Indian food with a reasonable budget
5
We decided to visit this place due to mere energy and smiles on the face . We decided to sit out doors to enjoy the weekend hustle of the little india . Then started the journey of taste from amazing Panipuris to paneer tikka and crispy Aalloo tiki .The chilled beers and hospitality of the servers made us just sit and relax in midst of the madness around .The main course was equally great with an egg masala and some naan and Romali rotis .If you are not a big fan of taste and not decorations and presentation on the plate . It's. A great pic .Cheers and keep the good work Thanks
5
Our 4th visit to this restaurant. We have never been inside, instead sitting outside on the footpath. The staff are always friendly and the food is alwayd good. The menue is quite extensive so it takes some time to choose. Luckily the beer is cold, so you can have a drink while choosing the food
4
Staff were great, service was good & Bill Shock for Singapore in a postive rathe rthan a negative for a change.
3
If you want a pit stop when visiting Little India, this no-frills little restaurant gets the job done in a short time: we had a Cheese Naan and a Mulligatawny soup with tea and lassi and were satisfied.
4
Very good food and okay price! ~50 dollar (SGD) for 2 person including 2 main courses, rice, naan, raita and 4 drinks. If you dont like spicy, tell the waiter whfn ordering.
4
The dÃ©cor in this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired!The mutton biryani and chicken tikka that we ordered were realty tasty, the gobi paratha was average tasting but filling.The boti kebabs took forever and were really bad. This dish should definitely be avoided here!To give them due credit however, they did not charge us for this dish after we told them that it was really bad ...
5
We visited Khansma on a busy Sunday evening, the food was excellent and very reasonably priced. The fact they serve Kingfisher beer was a bonus, we had the tandoori mushrooms to start (lovely but spicy). For mains butter chicken and vegetable manchurian, both we're amazing and toned down in spice to our request. A must try while in Singapore
3
No doubt that the food is good i oredered the chicken tikka masala, naan bread and biryani rice. But the bad thins is i need to wait for about 30 mins for my order and i think that staff dont care they dont even inform me that my food will be delay and the moment i fallow up my order thats the time they check it. The food is really good but if service continue to be like this i think its not worth it to visit it. Maybe if you have all the time in the world.
4
One fine day when we dint feel like eating home food, too tired to cook something yummy, when mouth just wanted yummy Indian food, with Singapore's home delivery charges I think its best to just step out and eat, that's when we found khansama, Wondering how it would be we just trusted the ratings in trip advisor as we always do and took a chance, to a surprise food was yummy but again the chicken 65 curry we ordered dint feel too fresh but its 2 days since we had and our tummy's are al right ;) so it must have been find...just dint feel it fresh, Achari chicken tikka is something which i am going for again to khansama, loved it. green chutney is amazingggg never liked green chutney in many restaurants but its just tasty here all this achari chicken tikka 4 pieces, chicken 65 curry, 1 garlic nan and 1 roti all this costed us 32$ SGD which was fair enough i felt.... looking forward to visit again soon, want to try jungle tandoori next time as I believe its a part of khansama group :)keep it up guys, but again the table and chairs dint feel very comfortable, table is too high for the chair and is very heavy to pull, but its fine, I would recommend you to make a booking before visiting the restaurant as we did so you can choose on where to be seated, and the restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived, food arrived in 10-15 mins fair enough considering that it was crowded that day.I would definitely recommend it but may be not for a very big occasion, may be for a casual lay dinner, don't expect too much of ambience, but food is YYYummm !!
5
Had a great Northern Indian meal here on our stopover back to Australia. Enjoyed the street scape, helpful suggestions on menu from lady who seemed to be running the show - our kids loved it. Did over order but particularly loved the chicken tikka, mutter paneer and lamb rogan josh - if we could have would have taken leftovers back with file or journey home
4
I had dinner here two nights in a row, first night whit chichen tikka, butter chicken and bread, second night just for fried rice and chicken. Both nights was great food and very helpfull staff. The last night i forgot my bag, and when i came back the staff had it ready for me, nothing missing.Can only recommen
5
I stayed in singapore with my family for 8 days and for continuous 8 days we had one of our meals at this place...The food here was too good be it dal makhani , veg biryani , allo gobhi.etc etc everything tasted just perfect...Try this place it wont disappoint you at all ...its located in little india which is very easy to reach either by taxi, mrt or bus..If you love indian food khansama is THE PLACE in singapore...
4
The food is good and fresh. Decent service. The prices are fair too. A good place for getting Indian food
4
Khansama is a highly recommended Indian restaurant in Singapore. while this does not have the ambience of a great business meeting restaur ant, the food here is authentic, classy and definitely worth trying again. the service is quite fast and its open till late. if you visit Little India and do not want to go 'SOUTH INDIAN' IN Terms of your lunch or dinner, this would be an ideal place to visit. Prices are reasonable
4
I recently had dinner at Khansama with two work colleagues. We chose to be seated outside in Norris Road, and one thing we did notice was that the majority of patrons on the night we visited appeared to be tourists. We each ordered entrees and mains plus dahl, palau rice and roti, which was too much for us to eat. We would suggest for a party of three to only order two mains and two rice if you are also getting an entree and dahl! The cost for our meals (including drinks) was $130 SGD, which we thought was reasonable value. We were generally happy with our meals - I ordered the mutton vindaloo for mains and while it was considerably milder than I expected, it was certainly hot enough for my two companions! Our only issue was one of our entrees was brought out well after our mains when we had nearly finished our meals.We would be happy to return.T
4
A friend recommended Khansama for good Indian food, and it was certainly a good recommendation!Location: Farrer Park MRT. Located near Mustafa, where you can buy anything you need in the world, 24/7.Food: We ordered a spread of dishes, including Palak Paneer, Manchurian chicken, Malai chicken and dishes I cannot remember the name of (sadly). I enjoyed every single one, especially the Palak Paneer (although I'm biased towards this dish) and Malai chicken.Will definitely return (am craving the Palak Paneer as I write this review)!Decor & Service: Love the decor as well, and the fact that they did not chase us when my friends and I were just sitting around chatting after finishing our food. Although, do note that food takes a while to be served, so if you're in a rush, this may not be the best restaurant for you. Other than that, Khansama is definitely worth a visit
4
It happened to visit Khansama Tandoori village at Science park. We love the ambience and quite spacious. My daughter like the Paneer sheekh kebab and Mango lassi. They have more options for Vegetarians. It is good option for family dinner its away from Little India/Seragoon crowd
1
Today we thought of giving a try to khansama as I heard good review from couple of persons. But this was really very bitter experience for us, we never had before . Pathetic tasteless food with waste of time and money, even our tummy got upset after having little food of that place. We ordered first veg manchurian and mixed chat bt both were tasteless. More salt in manchurian n chat was disappointing .. In main course, gravies n naan .. Bt gravies were so heavy in eating.. N naan we're not good at all.. We left all our food as it is.. N left.. Really very very disappointing.. I will never recommend this place to anyone n will never visit this place again. There are lot more good restaurants in singapore having quality food with superb taste. I really don't understand why people come to this place .. May be they are not aware of other great restaurants. We spent 28 sgd per person
2
We heard some pretty good reviews about Khansama and visited the place a couple of times. Unfortunately, we gave it the second try despite our first experience not being very pleasant. Food first, very greasy and feels super heavy on the stomach. Indian food's all about flavour and seasoning and not oil, so they get it completely wrong. Despite having a pretty exhaustive menu, many dishes taste pretty much the same. The staff seem pretty uninterested in the proceedings. Overall, it's not an Indian restaurant I would recommend
2
Very slow service though food is not that bad. Comfortable seating, so ok place to go, if your tired after a visit to Mustafa :), but not if you're very hungry because it takes ages for the food to be served. Ok, but not the best place for Indian food in Singapor
1
My purse was stolen at this restaurant in the middle of the day. There were very few patrons there when the theft occurred. I would not recommend that anyone go to this restaurant. The staff/management were absolutely no help. In addition, the food was substandard and overpriced. There are plenty of great Indian restaurants in Singapore. This is not one of them
4
wide range of items on menu, quick service, tasty north indian food, reasonable price.the tandoori chicken and mixed kababs are great. another must have item is - agra chat.their cheese naan is soft and not chewy at all.butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, dahi chicken, chicken 65 fish amritsari, garlic prawns are very tasty. portions are usually enough for 2-3 people.among vegetarian category, daal, malai kofta, panner butter masala are excellen
4
Khansama is a good place if you are looking for some north indian punjabi cuisines. Food was good and service was great. They also provide free delivery to hotels.
5
Don't be deceived by the exterior. Go inside to experience authentic Indian cuisine in a delightfully ornate setting. Great quality and good value. Very helpful staff.
2
Went there on a Saturday night for dinner. I have been there months back during lunch. Some of the dishes are great; some OK. The egg dish, really 8 bucks for 2 eggs scrambled with vegetable-- a bit overpriced for what it is. We ordered 4 dishes for the 2 of us. Service was slow-- not sure intentionally so my partner can down another large beer before the food come. Observed that they do a fair amount of take out orders. And the place was not full. Upon our arrival, the "sir"- Caucasian man got a greeting while the Asian lady was not even acknowledge. I often noticed this at certain restaurants here in Singapore, just because I'm Asian that does not mean I'm a non-existence. For that matter, I won't be returning even if the food is decent. My message to the restaurant owner-- train your waiters to acknowledge all customers
4
Singapore has a lot of India population. But that does not mean every eatery/restaurant will have good north indian food. However, Khansma tandoor restaurant is way above the rest of the restaurants serving north indian cuisine. The staff, the cook and the food is genuinely north indian. A must go for savoring real indian food.
4
I do visit Khansama when Im in Singapore, as Im nostalgic about eating here regularly when I lived in the city. Nevertheless they serve good north Indian food and for Indians looking for North Indian food which is closest to what they would get back home this is your best bet. Eating out at Khansama was never disappointing, and this doesnt matter which outlet your eating at
4
My hubby and I went here on the spur of the moment. We were not disappointed. Everything tasted authentic and to perfection. Mango lassi, Dahl makhani, raita.. Everything was perfect. Would recommend this place to everyone. Oh and my hubby says not to forget to tell you about the samosas. They are awesome
4
Once you get passed the touts out front, you will be looked after by the attentive staff. I had a very satisfying meal of chicken reshami and vegie pakoras. The naan was a bit on the greasy. Price was a bit more than other places nearby but your paying a premium for the place I suppose. All in all I'd go back
4
Appearances can be deceptive and this is the case with this restaurant. We were walking past and were stopped by one of the waiters and given a menu..as the kids were hungry we thought we'd give it a go... Aloo Paratha, Paneer Pakora and Papdi Chaat all cooked to perfection, tasty and well presented... A gem of a place... Go on give it a go!!!!!!
3
While I'm not an expert on Indian cuisine, I have eaten at enough Indian restaurants to know what is and isn't good. The wait staff here are very attentive, but our outside table was right near the corner of Serangoon Rd, so it was quite noisy. Being a Sunday afternoon didn't help as Little India is at its busiest.The menu is bewildering and busy, so we took a stab at 2 entrees and 2 mains to share, plus rice, drinks and bread. The starters were ordinary - the chicken tikka was tender enough, but the potato kebab was more spinach than potato and the patties were overcooked and hard.The rice was nicely spiced with cumin and the mutton masala was tender and tasty. The black dahl was pleasant enough but lacked punch. The garlic naan was, however, spot on. Nicely charred, with a garlicky punch, it was the perfect foil to the mutton.We ordered a drink each to start and had to order a second round due to the spiced ness of the food. We were not offered water, although there was a jug of chilled water on Just remember whenever you dine out that Singapore restaurants add tax and a service charge to your bill, so it may not be the value you thought
5
Okay, so it's in little India and may give some guests the feel of a 'tourist trap'....Not so, not all all. We do Indian everywhere we go and this was our third Indian meal for the trip...the other two, one of which was at the renowned Punjab Grill, were just so so...we thought, where better to go than little India for real Indian? After passing up a few places for lunch that were truly tourist traps, we ended up here. Do not eat downstairs along the sidewalk! Escape the humidity to the upstairs air conditioned room where you will find beautiful authentic wall carvings and furniture...the service was average, but the food was AMAZING! The butter chicken was to die for, not overpowering on the spices and delicately balanced. The chicken tikka was cooked perfectly, just hit all of the high points. As for the chicken tikka masala, was creamy and one of the best I have ever tasted overseas, better than anything in the US for sure! We ate like kings, three of us! for approx S$ 88.00. Fantastic meal at an outstanding price considering what we have spent for less...This is a place worth putting on your to-do list! We shall return
4
We went to Biopolis branch of Khansama on a Friday afternoon. We had their buffe for $12. It was very tasty. Though it was a bit crowded and food was getting exhausted, and we had to wait, we enjoyed it thoroughly.
3
I am a kebab fan. I found bit of coconut or what tasted like coconut in them. Yuck! Even the chicken gravy had the same problem. Not going there again. Also, i had an upset stomach the next day:(
4
Went to this place during a month in singapore. Really enjoyed the food. Decent traditional choice at good prices. Would recommend trying here.
4
The place feels like a tourist trap, as a person is actively and continuously recruiting customers at the premises (Little India branch).However, having read the reviews on TA, I decided to give it a try anyway.I love a good lamb or mutton vindaloo , and have eaten dozens of them all over the world.In Singapore I think I've tried the dish at around 10 Indian restaurants, and I can happily tell that Khansama had the best version of them all.Come to think of it, also the naan and the samosa were pretty good.The service was very attentative. The toilet was a bit dirty and very basic, which is in line with most other Indian restaurants in the area.. Also, the price is reasonable: Comparable to other Indian restaurants in the area.I'll be back
4
Visiting Singapore for business and our Indian Clients took us to the Science Park location. From the moment we entered the authentic decorations told me that this was going to be a great food experience and it was. We don't get much Northern Indian food in Atlanta........... so the dishes with a little spice were an added treat to the fantastic flavor. We had the lunch buffet, and for $11.99 it was a steal.............. especially for Singapore. I will go back during my next trip
4
They had only mutton vindaloo (center) and chicken tikki masala (right) but both were fantastic! The mutton vindaloo was absolutely amazing. They must have cooked it for a really long time for the mutton to be so tender, infused with spices and vindaloo sauce. Especially liked those with tendons! Rating: 4.5/5 The chicken tikki masala had a thick sauce and the chicken they used were thigh parts so it was very tender. The cream sauce blended well with the chicken, and they didn’t overdose the chicken with spices so you can still taste the freshness. Rating: 4/5Visit my blog for complete review ^^ http://dineordie.wordpress.com
3
We were canvassed to eat there. Having read reviews on TA I readily agreed. Went upstairs and seated. They started cleaning the table after us being seated. Armed with knowledge gained from TA I was very cautious in ordering. But the quantity was insufficient. Food was very good. In the end they slipped us a bill for 140 SGD instead of 80 + SGD. This I brought to their notice and it took a very long time to rectify it and bring back the balance. I dong think I will go back there again
4
Totally agree with this review title “Great food - attentive or pushy staff?” but great food and although pushy staff, very friendly with the great Indian Smile.Awesome authentic Indian Food which is all absolutely delicious but we as the staff were a little pushy we over ordered zills and ended up with way too much food. They need to back off a little so if you are reading this guys, "Take Note" Back off a little because for every person that comes back, as we did, (ate here twice) many wouldn't come back and may not recommend you. If it works then ok but its dam annoying. Recommend ordering entree then move on at a course at a time. Great place to eat
4
I was really tossing up whether to give this 5 stars because we had a fantastic meal here. The service was very good and we were given great advice when choosing the dishes we wanted. Nice cold Kingfisher beer served in ice cold glasses really went down well. In my opinion you would be made not to try this restaurant. Try the Mixed Tikka for starters which was just yummy
5
Buttered chicken and garlic naan was super yummy. We had our fave chicken tandoori and its delicious and spiced just right. For a simple dinner for 2, we spent SG$41.A bit pricey and quite a long walk from our hotel, but well worth it. More people started to arrive around 8pm and got pretty crowded. We'll definitely come back for more
5
Absolutely delicious! One of the best places for Indian non veg in singapore . Value for money! You might find the hotel bit congested.
4
One of the best indian restaurant in the neighborhood
The food was excellent
The service is prompt and smiley
Choose a table not right under the air-conditionning
3
Food was very good. Prices are reasonable. Quick Service and staff are very courteous. A very close proximity to all the hotels and MRT and could be easily accessed from various locations.
5
Authentic north Indian food in the hustle bustle of Singapore. .....bit expensive, but worth the spend. ....can give any indian speciality restaurant run for money for its taste. ...
4
The food that I had was good, and all the staff were very friendly. I was by myself though and it was clear they were eager to get the table free so I felt a little rushed. Overall good though.
3
It was going to be a quiet, reasonably priced, quick, quiet lunch - this place was recommended.Got seated upstairs and it was quiet - so far so good.Explained I only wanted a couple of starters - not a big meal. Felt I got upsold a bit too much.Food arrived timely - ticked the quick box.Sure the food was very, very nice (...maybe a little pricey than I expected??). Paneer shashlik was delicious, felt I got upsold into a Butter Chicken (it was good, but I didn't need it!)Mango Lassi delicious.Staff were attentive and checked on how I was going, but somehow I felt that it was mechanical and not genuine.I didn't finish it all - too much food!It was great food. Sometimes there is a fine line between attentive and pushy - can't help feeling they pushed too far over that line
4
I love this place. The food is excellent. The service is decent for the cost....but really its about the food here.I absolutely love the mixed chicken tikka plate, its my favorite starter. Really can't go wrong with much on the menu here. Channa masala and Dahl Makhni are also fabulous.Only downside is that it can get pretty noisy and claustrophobic upstairs...otherwise its a great choice for indian in SG
5
Yesterday my husband and I spent a full afternoon walking Little India. We decided to eat at Khansama and were not disappointed. We shared the vegetable samosas as a starter and I had the curry chicken which was excellent. I also tasted the butter chicken that my husband ordered and was equally impressed. Don't overlook their fresh tamarind sauce and the nan was also delicious. The service was quality and for a city that can be on the pricey side, the overall meal was reasonable
2
We occasionally visit this place close our home. It has got a rural themed somewhat weird decor. You could like or hate the life size buffalo mannequin squatting at the entrance!We had gone there for a special occasion and the experience was marred due to bad service. They took such a long time to serve simple drinks that we had to walk to the bar to serve ourselves. After the ordering was complete the waiter warned it was less for the number of heads urging us strongly to increase the quantity. When the food arrived at the table, we found it was too much. We spoke to the manager to cancel the order citing their mistake - he declined and offered to pack to for us to have as lunch next day! He added - that next time we can get it right with the experience we earned. Well, we are never going back for to use our experience

I sat down at this restaurant because I was hungry and it was the first one I came across after deciding to eat. I'm very glad I did as they served the best food I've eaten in the Little India area, probably the best Indian food I've had in Singapore. There was a bit of a mix up when my appetiser was delivered to the wrong table, and I got theirs, but not really an issue as when I got what I'd ordered it was delicious. The trouble was, the appetiser was large! When my main arrived I couldn't finish it; no problems with portion size here. All in all, highly recommended

Khansama was recommended by the hotel staff. Samosa's and naan were excellent. The curries ok. Good and attentive staff, & reasonable price. Had cheaper over the 3 days. But not better.
4
I had the dhall, and chicken tandoori and the chai. Food and service was very good. Definitely recommend.
5
One of the staff coerced us inside, and we relented when we heard they had air conditioning. But the food and service did not disappoint. We ordered lots of dishes and had plenty of food; prices were quite reasonable.

Situated right in the heart of little India. Went here with my work team of 12 people. Service was ok , though 3 of us never had our order taken as we were away from the table. The waitress soon recovered this though. The food came out hot n tasty and almost all at the same time. Some achievement. The cooking area can be viewed on the lower level which is a great way to ensure high standards are maintained. Recommend

In Singapore, I liked very few restaurants for their Non-Veg (mutton) and these are the best in this.Also I have given 2 parties in this restaurant and staff are very supportive an flexible in terms of arrangements.Quality taste is much better than other options available in this area. I recommend mutton items we are planning to have anything, its best over here

We were looking for somewhere reasonably priced to eat in Little India. This restaurant is upstairs at 166 Serangoon road. The decor is nice with heavy wooden tables. We had a savory pappadum - a large one with spicy salsa, five pieces of chicken tikka - all different flavours, rice and kashmiri naan and garlic naan. The food was excellent and the drinks prices were also reasonable. Good attentive servic
4
For the food and attentive friendly staff we give 4 stars and if we had to rate our company for dinner, we'd give them 5 stars as we had a great evening! Chef needs to improve on the rice though, otherwise, a very good dinner was had by all of us

The restaurant is located in Little India street and offers decent Indian food at reasonable price. However, we had to wait for 25 -30 minutes after ordering the food which was not our expectation . Otherwise, it is a fine place for Indian food. You can also visit Mustafa Mall located near this place for shopping

Don't get me wrong, this place is OK but doesn't deserve the accolades others have given it based on the meal we had there recently.We were given a table on the busy foot path with no option of dining inside even though there were tables available. The waiters doubled as touts trying to attract diners and we almost felt we were being used as "bait" to lure other westerners.The food was good, not great but fresh and plentiful and the waiters were attentive and made suggestions as to what we should order. The bill came as a surprise though, just under $100 including 4 beers. We pay less in Australia for a comparable meal. Contrast this with the two delicious Chinese meals we had on other nights just a few blocks away which cost a third of this
5
this is also popular with locals nice rates & tasty food juicy and delicious tandoori chicken & fish snacks it is near mustafa & after tiring with the shopping bills it is pocket friendlly with taste like a home town staff is also well known indian guys to serve you better don't miss it .........

We went in this restaurant 2 times last week, there was excellent, the specialities were famous and the staff very pleasant. we recommend this restaurant without hesitation.
4
Some of the best Indian food we have ever had - very authentic. Starters were a highlight. Service was good, would recommend if staying in Little India.
5
We enjoyed the very friendly and helpful service. All the dishes the staff recommended were delicious. Try Panni Poori for a surprise with every bite. Mango Lassi was nice but expensive. The ambience outdoor is authentic. We had an awesome evening!
5
We have eaten at Khansama on our last two visits to Singapore and have not been disappointed. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. The recommendations of the staff were spot on and given the number of Indians eating here I would say it is popular with the locals as well. My sons have also eaten at the Khansama at Biopolis (near Buona Vista and Holland Village) and highly recommend it for those working/living/visiting in this area of Singapore

For all those tired of visiting the hawker centers around singapore, i suggest a visit here to get an Indian flavour.The malai & tandoori tikka were sublime...Moist / juicy & tender...The sheek kabab spicy & juicy.The punjabi butter chicken was the highlight of the dinner which when eaten with rotis & the biryani filled our hearts with joy.The chinese food is the " Indian Chinese"....most indians will find it very familiar.The place is open till late & last orders are at 12:30 & the service can be extended if you insist.....Also another surprise is the availability of Kingfisher Strong beer & Old Monk rum :-)DO visit it & you'll remember the good tandoori joint back home...

The ambiance was fantastic very romantic and cosy .The waiters were attentive ,pleasant and knew their menu well.The menu was extensive with descriptions .Tried the Malai tikka(chicken) which was fantastic one of the best I have tried in an north Indian restaurant . Masala popadom and mixed raita were good .With grated cheese on the popadom and the raita was thick and creamy.But the brinjal pakora,palak paneer,and prawn tandoori were a let down .I couldn't taste the brinjal in the pakora and it was hard ,where else the paneer was made with old spinach thus giving it a bitter taste ,the prawns were dried,hard till inedible .The briyani was also a slight disappointment as there were mixed frozen vegetables in it and was a tad too dry with them not using long grained basmathi The strawberry lassi tasted like it came out of a pre packed bottle also .Would defiantly try other dishes still and visit the place .Its not too pricey either and reasonable .One can get there by exiting Farrer Park MRT Station with a 8 minute walk to it

My wonderful friends took me here when I visited them in Singapore. Could equate it to standalone fine-dine restaurants in India. The food was tasty, rotis soft and it was filled with Indians, obviously enjoying the food. The staff was a little bit confused but I think they ended up doing a good job in the end. You have old Bollywood music playing in the background and Amitach Bachhan and Shashi Kapoor on the flat screen TVs. It's more Indian than restaurants in India! Would love to go back sometime

Tempted to seek out the Khansama restaurant as recommended in "The Hunt Singapore". Nestled within Little India, a very relaxed place where you feel very welcome; a cool piece of respite after a long and hot walk exploring around the streets. The staff were happy and helpful with selecting the best choices from the menu. The decor was authentic and the music was fab. We started with a delicious selection of tandoori chicken and followed with butter chicken and another prawn main dish. The Butter naan was superb!! Highly recommend this gem within Little India and will return if ever back in Singapore in the future. Excellent food and value for money

I am sure most of the North Indian public would like to have their desi styled Non Veg and Veg for a dinner after having lots of noodles. Sarso ka Saag here was Yummy and also Paneer Tikka Masala. As I am a Vegetarian but did hear with my co diners that food is YUMMY. So a Good Place to go.

I went to this restaurant wid my parents.. the ambience was something which was quite different n gud.. the service was gud.. n da food was damn tasty. Only complaints are tat da waitors dnt serve food in ur plate.. u hav to self serve.. n other one that i had ordered for boneless meat n still was served wid bones as da waitor forgot to convey it to the chef.. but the dish was replaced immediately on informing them.. the service was commendable.. all in all a fine dining expeerience.

If you wanna eat spicy , real taste of north india go to that place. i always enjoyed thier food. Best time is if you can go in lunch time, buffet. Low price nice food.

Ive struggled to find decent barbeque (indian or otherwise) in Singapore (not a place to go on a low carb diet!!!) but Khansama hit the spot.Their grills are divine (not the kebabs though - stick to the tikkas). In fact everything Ive tried there, grilled or not, has been excellent. Their tandoori oven means that their bread is excellent - try their mint naan. Their curries are perfect: not too oily and just the right amount of spice - ive tried their kadhai, dupiaza, mysore and their dhaal gosht (daal with lamb tikka). always 10 out of 10. Its also reasonably priced. Depending on how much of a glutton you are, 15-30 sing dollars will get you a great meal with a beer. I cant say much about the ambience as i always sit outside... so youre left with the ambience of Little India - not my favourite but the food makes it worth it! Enjoy

This restaurant is pricy comparative to others in the vicinity but it is a treat after the grottiness of most of them. The food is very good but the service is a bit patchy although vey friendly. This is a place to eat and linger for a bit rather than eat and go. We had a variety of dishes, all good sitting outside with a fan and felt just fine, full and fresh but for this paid about $60 for two whereas the adjacent cafes where the locals ate cost about $10-15 for the same thing. We ate at some of those too and the food was great but if you want the ambience it has a price which we found well worth it for a special occasion

I had been to this place twice and this place has never disappointed me. Ambiance is good. Walls with carvings of Gods makes u feel inside a Temple if you sitting at the back. An Old wall Clock which look like "DEAD" is actually working.Nice Seating arrangements. Need to be done something with Roof with cracks. Service can be sometimes sloppy as waiter are very less. but apart from all i go there just for Indian Food... Home food away from Home. They make it same as restaurant sin India and that's the specialty. Any Indian away from home for long knows how it feels when u get your home country food and its great when it tastes same. Try tandoori Nonveg items as they are good. You will love chicken and mutton gravy items too. In veg i liked Dal Fry, Mix veg and Mushroom Paneer. They don't have Kadi Pakoda on menu but they will prepare it for you on short notice and you will love it.I love the place and you will find many foreigners enjoying the food there. As all that matters is food, ambiance is secondary.If you had find the post helpful, kindly click on same to keep me encouraged

We had lunch there today. We ate upstairs. There were lots of locals eating so I thought we were in for something special. We were talking to a fellow seated outside- probably the owner- who raved about the place. Said it was number one. Well I beg to differ. Very average meal. No vege samosa available so had these little vege rissoles which were dry And hard. Then chicken tikka which was good. Slow cooked lamb Rogan Gosh. Dont think so!! Cooked for about an hour. Was hard but at least not too spicey. Beer expensive. For the price we paid felt it was overpriced. I've eaten loads of Indian food in many cities. This is down the bottom of the list. Not impresse

When I go to Singapore I never miss the opportunity to have a dinner at Khansama.I'm a customer of this restaurant since almost 10 years now, but I'm really not yet tired to go there every time I can.The food is excellent (you must like spicy food of course) and the location is nice. I usually eat not along the road but at the first floor...Moreover, what guarantees the quality is that the restaurant is largely frequented not only by tourists, but also and especially by local indian community. What a better prove to say that the food is good?I have only one regret: when I started frequenting this place, the forniture was cheaper but on all the walls there were big screens with non-stop Bollywood videos going on for all the night. Now it has been restructured and it is for sure nicer, but I miss the videos: they were creating a real great atmosphere

This place does no way deserve to be so highly rated. Food was ordinary and I asked for spicey but was very bland. Waiters were useless and it is wayyyyyy overpriced. They made me pay for water when everyone around me had free tap water. I wont come back again and I cannot recommend this place. The only people dining were tourists who probably like me read the reviews, I think that says it all as no locals were here, only westerners
3
Staff was very friendly and on the toes for the service, but the food was very average.We had a chicken tikkat butter masala, with naan and fresh lime soda.Quantity of food was good, but Quality was missing, just like any average restaurant, Certainly not upto the mark like they advertise themselves as best in Indian Food.Nothing to complain about though, just not upto the value of money paid for the same.The best food I had was at Indian Summer write opposite the Mustafa Center, But I cant find that Restaurant on TripAdvisor.Nothing against the place, just not that good
3
I was there with my family on 14th Oct.The ambience is average they are trying to force fit as many tables as they can. I have to literally stand up to allow some at my back to move out. Its really tough to have a conversation.Baring few staff seems to be confused, its kind of extreme one knows its business completely and other is just naive. Food was good can say had one of the best kebabs in singapore...compare to any other good indian restaurants i have been to.I will give a thumbs up to food though it is at higher side, the per person it will at least cost SGD 20 with one drinks. Good place if you want to have quick indian food and move on, not recommended for ppl who want to hold conversation

I am regular visitor to Singapore because of my business. i am sick and tired of eating at khansma from years but whenever i try at some other place i regret. This time also i tried at Copper Chimney at syed alvi road and i am sorry to say that i was badly disappointed. I will be writing a review on their performance also in trip adviso
5
Good surroundings, helpful and friendly staff and damn good food, especially the tandoor dishes. What more can I say!
4
Looove the food in this place!
Best Butter Chicken and Tikka in the country!
Oh, and lets not forget the Samosas and Naan!
Seriousy good food.

I tried both the Castle (in Biopolis) and the Village (Science Park) and found their food to be very good (for a non-Indian who likes Indian food). I go for my favorite dishes and always found them very tasty and enjoyable .
5
Right in the bustle of Little India is this great restaurant. Tandoori chicken is great and there are heaps of vegetarian options. Also large bottles of Kingfisher beer at a good price. What more could you want ? Toilet could use a bit of a clean
5
We discovered this place by luck and we have been immediately got attracted by the awesome spicy smell.. We took the best decision ever! Khansama is one of the best Indian restaurant I've ever been also considering London, US and Italy!Food was great, portions were big and waitresses were very nice and friendly.The place was full of tourists as well as Indian which remarks the extremely high quality of the food served here!Recommend to everyone to stop by!!Minor remark for some of you might be table dislocation. I strongly recommend to eat outside being aware that tables are on the sidewalk.. this made our experience even more interesting and unforgettable
4
We often go to this restaurant and quality of food is consistent and rates are affordable.you should try chicken kebab masala and rumali roti, for rice its Egg biriyani. they also make amazing Dal fry. overall we enjoyed this restaurant and recommend this for someone who is looking to have authentic Indian cuisin
5
I have been living in Singapore for the past few years and I would strongly recommend Khansama to anyone who is looking for authentic North Indian Food in Singapore. The staff is very friendly and the pricing is very reasonable. The restaurant is open till late in the evening and is a place that one can visit even after finishing their day time activities. Must try the tandoori items served at this restaurant as they are authentic. So for authentic north indian food in Singapore do not go anywhere else. You won't be disappointed. The pricing is very reasonable both for food as well as for drinks

We came here a couple of months ago and went back tonight. The food was the same, same presentation, same quality. We really enjoyed it. We ordered malai chicken (Starter), mutton bhuna ~13SGD (quite hot), garlic naan ~4SGD (really well baked) and basmati plain rice ~4SGD. Portion are pretty good, prices are fair, quality is very good. Drinks are also well priced where a large bottle of Tiger will cost you ~7SGD. The only downside is that the staff is pushing a too much to my opinion, and the price for starter are as high as main course. A good place to go, and I would definitely go back

a typical little india restaurant on the second story. we were quickly served with cold drinks when we got in. the beers were only available in big bottles.we ordered for the three of us some tandoori chicken starters which were pretty awesome and spicy enoughthe waitress gave a great recommendation for the mains and the amounts to order. we had palak paneer, butter chicken and chicken massala, accompanied by naan and bryani rice.the taste was great and again lovely spicy. it felt it was made with love.a bit of a downer were the not so clean toilets and the shabby ceiling and walls.certainly get back for food but the owners should pay more attention to the overall experience

Most of the restaurants in little India specialize in south Indian cuisine but here tandoori and northern Indian is there speciality. I usually gave the vegetarian dishes - black lentils, Auvergne curry and a purÃ©ed spinach dish I sampled recently were all very tasty as is the bread served fresh from the tandoor. The tours outside are a bit off putting but the good more than makes up for i
