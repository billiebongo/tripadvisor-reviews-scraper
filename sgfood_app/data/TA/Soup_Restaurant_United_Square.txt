The food are delicious and so are the desserts. I specially like the soup as it really tasted like home-cooked. We have ordered the traditional set menu and all dishes tasted well.

The food is average, even the most popular Samsui chicken also taste so so. The 招牌豆腐 and the fish also not tasty. Not recommended.

Overall an average restaurant. Food quality is acceptable. Waitress was considerate to advise us when too much food was ordered.

Always a delightful experience whenever I dine here. Service staff are highly attentive and courteous. Food is always good. Love the Samsui chicken which our all time favorite.

Don't get me wrong - the Soup Restaurant offers good food, not least their signature Samsui Chicken which is not only tasty (think Hainanese chicken rice-style chicken) but also healthy (eaten with chopped ginger in sesame oil, wrapped in lettuce). Most of their other dishes, even the mains, serve only as side dishes to make up the rest of the meal. And their waiting staff are more than competent in their roles, eager to help when selecting from the menu, and generally friendly. What I do wish, however, is that they wouldn't use stools for seating, and that there's more space in their restaurants. Ok, I'm just being nit-pickity here but our most recent dinner here was in a 'private' room that was simply too cramped. Coupled with babies crying in the next cubicle, it was simply too noisy, and that made it hard to enjoy ourselves much. Better luck next time, hopefully

This popular chain restaurant never fails to impress with its Samsui Ginger Chicken. In fact, every table had the dish on it. Spread the chopped ginger on the succulent and tender chicken pieces, wrap them with lettuce leaves and we have ourselves a bite of its signature dish. The order taker was very helpful in recommending a few dishes once we told her of our dietary requirements. The Claypot Salmon could do with a little less salt, but that is just my opinion. Service was efficient with our chrysanthemum tea constantly being refilled.To maximise the space, each table was placed close to each other, but the patrons did not seem to mind as all of us were engrossed eating the Samsui Ginger Chicken

Ordered 4 dishes: mee suah, fried fish belly, broccoli with beancurd mushroom and luffa with egg (all in medium size) for 4 persons (none of us is big eater), portion has become much smaller than 5 months ago, the luffa dish is incredibly tiny. To make things worse, all of us were super thirsty after the meal, which has never happened before.Service is always below average since day 1. Should have spent money elsewhere

We are a family of 3 that visited the place for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place has interesting white decor and has fairly decent seating area. Owing to the popularity of the place, there are long queues of patrons. We were ushered in quickly and got a table overlooking the pharmacy joint Holland and Barrett. Does feel like a mannequin on display with people gawking from outside. When we sat down it was extremely noisy with the sounds of crockery being banged. Soon in full public view, the garbage was ceremoniously wheeled out from the restaurant in a covered bin passing our table!!! Bon Appetit!!!We ordered the large helping of Hometown Tofu, Chicken Steam Rice with Sausage in a clay pot, Chinese Tea, Chrysanthemum tea, Orange juice. The waiter assisted us in suggesting that the tofu had shrimps and we requested for tofu without it. The food was served in 10 minutes. They brought in the tea, juice and a plate of boiling peanuts. Though the tea were unlimited, we were not offered any tea refills. The Chinese tea was normal and the Chrysanthemum one was a refreshingly sweet taste. The peanuts were boiled and tasted good. We thought they were complimentary but they were charged in our final bill. The claypot chicken was ok but the ginger fried rice was very tasty and highly recommended. The orange juice is bottled not fresh. The tofu was a really large serving, well prepared and very filling. This is also recommended.Our total bill was SGD 60 inclusive of taxes. We were charged SGD 1.20 for the packed wet tissue!!! Maybe you are better off carrying your own tissue!!!! Not many options for a strict vegetarian but is highly recommended to get a feel of Cantonese Cuisine.

Simple steamed chicken with garlice served with lettuce and cucumber, the Samsui Chicken is a must try should you visit the soup restuarant. I have patronised them many times and the food served are pretty simple but nice. The vegetable, Tofu and the double soup make a perfect chinese meal. Service can be slow during weekend lunch crowd and prepare for a short queue.
