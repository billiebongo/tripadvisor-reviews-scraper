I love the fried rice at Uncle Leong Signatures! Service was also really good as they constantly check on what I need throughout my meal there.

its chinese and seafood restaurant. the orange pork was tendered, the fried fish sliced was also tasty. its located inside waterway point mall. reasonable price for seafood menu(crabs and shrimp).

Very decent offer by a famous seafood brand in a Punggol Mall. The seafood selection was fantastic and the service was prompt and professional.

Celebrated my daughter‚Äôs birthday with my family. Great service with great food. Been back many times and will always be back as long as we have crab cravings. Thank you!

We didn't order the signature crab dishes, only ordered meat, vegetable and egg dishes. The taste wasn't outstanding but acceptable.
5
The service was very good! Friendly and helpful service staff. The food was very good and value for $

Happy dinning experience via chope! Everything seems to be fine except the sitting, table very small, no high round table for 7-8 sitting.

Most of the big names in the seafood restaurant business have a certain basic level of service. Just wanted to point out some oddities at this outlet in Waterway Point.For a round table of 10, when the sharksfin soup was served- we had to scoop it ourselves.We had to request for the dirty plates to be changed after 6-7 dishes had been served. But overall food service (speed of serving dishes) was quick and spread was a lot.It‚Äôs a convenient place, albeit pricey, to dine

Generally the food is very good. But there are service staff that kinda sometimes spoil the experience. Had a good uncle who was friendly and knows what he is doing. But also a Chinese staff who was either trying to do sales or trying to help. Can‚Äôt decide which. She tried to push their set menu quite fervently even when I told her there are specific dishes I wanted. Of cos the cost of the set was higher than what I wanted. Even size of the dishes as well. She kept harping on how many people we were. But don‚Äôt we know how much we can consume? And obviously we should be ordering all dishes based on number of people. We have people who are allergic to some food. All in all, our family like the place so we are repeat customers. But each time we visit there would always be issues and usually it‚Äôs with the Chinese staff.

Second visit this year. My must-haves are the crab beehoon and butter cheesy crab, great to dip the fried buns in the creamy sauce. Honey pork ribs and stuffed egg-tofu were very yummy too. Hot plate venison was a little tough (overcooked?). Finish with a refreshing soursop juice .. overall great meal!
5
Our third time. Food is good. Delicious every visit. Totally worth my money. Service is excellent as well. The staffs are friendly and nice. Very good dining place for family and friends who loves seafood.
3
Serving is slow. And Price is not cheap. They only have 1 price for each item. So if u want more goto add on. So add up the price is consider on the HIGH end. Will not visit again cos not worth.

Favourites Signature beancurd, crispy milk chicken, cereal prawn, yam paste, soursop. Spacious restaurant
5
the food was nice. it was serve quickly and pipping hot! üëçüèº service was good too. not very crowded on a friday night.
2
food does not taste really nice, price are really high, no atmosphere at all... i won't go back anyway.
5
The ease of booking is a plus point for a crowded place.
One thing, we have 12 of us and the big round table does not come with lazy suzy. So taking food is a hassle. We have to stand up to pass plates around.
5
Excellent food this is my 3-4th visits this year!!
Love the convenient location near mrt and setting.

This is my first visit to Leong with my family.Overall verdict: this is a winner !Their popular dish is the chili crab but we opted for the salted egg butter prawns. We also took the crispy milk granules chicken, fried fish (marble goby) in soy sauce, and stir fried spinach. Awesome combination. Best dish for me is the fried fish and salted egg prawns. Just a little caution on the rice serving size. We ordered seafood fried rice, yangchou and crabmeat rice, after the waitress said one order is good for only 1-2 people. Actually, size per order is apt for 3-4 people. We ended up with so much rice.Best beverage with this meal is hot chrysanthemum tea. Don't mind the price. Quality is assured at Uncle Leong.

I used to go to TPY when I have craving for crab, but, this time I went to Waterway Point and we order the signature crab as usual, the food is nice, and the place is clean & comfy. It is a little bit pricey compare to TPY and other outlet, other than that the food is always nice
5
The butter crab was excellent .. ordered fried buns to dip in the creamy butter sauce...YUMMY!. The Nescafe pork ribs were also very delicious, and aromatic. Didn't like the seafood you-tiao. Dishes are reasonably priced. Recommend to get the Chope vouchers to save some $... Service was great too with several changes of plates without having to ask. Location is a plus.. easy access by MRT.

Decided my order. Waitnress hard sell seafood. If you don't order any, she won't bother to entertain you üòí
3
Food is good however service is slow. Environment is very noisy and it's hard to have conversations.
4
Overall a nice experience. Friendly staffs around and nice food. The wait for dessert was slightly long given the preparation time required. Will go again
5
First time to try restau in waterway point. Food is sumptuous esp. the prawn shrimp. Service is good. Staff are very helpful. Place is accessible and atmosphere is suitable for family or friends dinner.
4
Food was yummy that you don't need any sauce to go with it. Service was good too. Price a little steep
4
Their seafood hor fun is very nice. A bit higher price than the usual and the staff can't understand english very well so ordering is a bit hard.
4
Food was served rather prompt and the service waiter are rather helpful. Variety of food on the menu differs from the other outlets as well!
4
Overall, the food is pretty good. Although the price of the crab is quite steep, the crab is fresh and delicious. However, it will be better if they could re-arrange their seating as it was kinda cramped with no space in between tables.
4
The serving time was quite long and we had to wait for 20 minutes before the first dish arrived. We also had to remind staff twice for our subsequent orders. The salted egg crab was finger licking. The Thai chicken mango was too sweet. Will return for more crab.
4
Tried their Mother Day's menu. First time eating there. Food was delicious but not cheap. Perhaps partly due to Mother's Day. We ate chilli crab, Shimmering Sand crab, crab meat sea cucumber fish maw in thick sauce, Hong Kong steamed red garoupa, soy sauce baked prawn, herbal chicken, Sunkist pork ribs, celery with baby clams, white baits vermicelli and bean paste pancake. Might go back again
4
Reasonable price, good environment and staff were diligent in changing plates. Suitable for large group too. Crab is a little pricey but was huge in serving
4
Food was great. Slight deterioration compared to the first time when it first open. Could do better. But all in all still quite palatable. Would visit again
4
Reasonable price, food is good with many variety, friendly staff too... We will definitely recommend to friend and family and will visit soon.
5
Loved the golden sand crab and chilli crab the most! Crab menu was extensive and it will take several visits to try all (:
3
Staff are friendly but food portion is small, especiallt Mao Tao and Drinks. Price is general higher than its another branch in Punggol.
However food taste is still good especially chilly crab, butter crab and other seafood.
2
food was average. ordered the chili crab. the crab was big and succulent. but the sauce was quite salty. may want to try other flavours
4
Crab was good. Small crabs considered big. Fresh and juicy. (Drunken herbal crabs)Cereal chicken was nice too.Food served fast and crab was last dish and we can slowly enjoy!Specially remmend these 2 dishes though we had more. My family love the crabs
4
Conveniently situated in a mall with air-conditioning and ample parking, this outlet of the well-known chain serving local seafood is good for family meals and gatherings. Besides reasonably priced delicious dishes, service is prompt and although seatings for big groups are limited due its causal dining layout and lack of private rooms, their helpful staff are always ready to make adjustments to ensure you have a good experience and will return. Good value for money indeed

They are famous for their crab. Try the crab bee hoon soup (they can top up more bee hoon and soup), chilli crab. Some of my friends like the golden sand but not me. Pepper crab was a disappointment too. Lacked the intensity of flavour.Crab bee hoon soup would be my first choice and was not wowed by it too.Their side dishes are average too. If you must, fried brinjal/aubergine is decent.If you are near Waterway Point, and fancy getting your hands dirty, come and try.Tip: don't wear white. Splash splas

Went there as a group of 10 adults, 2 kids and 1 infant on last Saturday, we were told that guests only get seated after they placed order at entrance due to manpower shortage, hence I got a little disappointed but family was still excited about our crab feast. Ordered 3 types of crabs - signature (creamy side), black pepper (voted fav among us) and chili crab. We also ordered qing long veg, 3 eggs vege, steamed fish (fresh and no stinky muddy smell), beancurd in wok (yummy as it stays warm long enough), 2 yam rings (awesome ones which are hard to find as they aren't overly oily), horfun and prawns. Service crew were polite and careful, especially with our table due to the 2 kids who wandered around the restaurant, playing.
