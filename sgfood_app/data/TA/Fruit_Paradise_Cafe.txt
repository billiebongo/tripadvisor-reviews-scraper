Plenty of variety to choose from, I had the banana and mango tart it was to die for. Not cheap but did taste very good. Order product by using tablet on table items then brought to your table

Delicious and beautiful fruits cakes. Price is a bit expensive for 1 small slice of cake and a jar of Rose buds tea for S$10.80.

Unique Dessert especially the strawberry Tiramisu. Other things that is good is the hot tea which you can get a refill of Hot water

Looking for a relax ambience after a hard day shopping in Vivo shopping mall.. IMO this is a good place to relax and enjoy the taste of the fruit pie with new experience everytime I try a new variety. Friendly waitress ushering to your seats and you can take your time to order your favorite fruit pie either by looking at the hard copy menu and asking the waitress to serve you or simply use their iPad attached to your table and order. I would advice select the promo set variety with a drink good enough for 2 person.

The food displays were what attracted my partner and I into this Japanese cafe. Plastic food never looked this good. Primarily serving tarts, cakes and all things sweet, one would frequent this cafe after a meal somewhere else. You are warmly greeted the Japanese way as soon as the staff notice you waiting at the entrance. A notice on each table subtly says that no sharing is allowed. We ordered the Chocolate Banana Tart and the French Mango Toast and both were beautifully plated on large white plates, giving the illusion that the serving portions were huge. You can never go wrong with cake and ice-cream. Service was minimal as the orders were sent to the kitchen via an iPad on each table. One would also walk to the cash counter to pay when you are done eating. A great place for desserts

Fruit Paradise has gorgeous looking tarts - they look fresh and fruity and bursting with flavour. We got the Mixed Fruit Tart - came with strawberry, banana, chestnut, and chocolate cream. The tart shell was super dry, the chestnut flavour was totally absent, and the fruits were sparse. Huge disappointment

My bf and I use to love coming here for tarts and tea every once in awhile, and yesterday decided to have a quick dessert before our movie. We should've figured by the crowd of 2 other patrons that things would be different. The tart serving size has shrunk by at least 30%, but the plates certainly have not. So it looks like an even more miserable serving. But worse, we ordered a coffee with the set and it was the nastiest coffee we had ever tasted. It tasted like burnt black crap in water that had been sitting on a stove for days. We asked how long it had been there and the staff said 8 minutes. LOL who are they kidding? Then when we explained how terrible the coffee was, we were offered not a fresh brew, or a tea, but milk. We are black coffee drinkers, but we are also nice people not wanting to make a mountain out of the situation. Milk can't fix repulsive. we couldn't finish another sip, but still had to pay the full price. We will not be returning. Only the sales of their full tarts can save them now. One star because the staff were not horrible, and the other because though minuscule, the tart is still pretty delicious

This is my 3rd time to this chain and today I went to the outlet at Punggol Waterway with my family.We attempted to order a few cakes but they were sold out and we had to change our orders twice.When the cake came, it looks pretty BUT the crust tasted burnt. I think they may have over baked the crust hence causing a burnt buttery taste.I hope they'll improve

Dont forget to drop by for a teatime treat super tummy cake with loads of fruit and nuts with a fruity tea as well..Fresh cream no synthetic cream. Many outlet in Singapore. Love this one at Vivo City.

The cake here was good but so shocked they refuse to serve ice water. Isn't that illegal? I'm so surprised as everywhere in Singapore gives the option to just drink water.

The cakes are a visual delight and the taste is even better. I had the caramel and nut which was delicious. I love the quirky ordering system where there is an iPad on the table and you place your own order.

Just had lunch and wanted to look for a place that sells cakes for birthday celebration. Chanced upon this Café and it offers quite a good variety of fruit cakes. Ordered 2 flavors of cakes and some drinks to celebrate birthday for someone in the family. Café has quite a relaxed atmosphere and great for mini birthday celebratio

If you have a sweet tooth Fruit Paradise cafe will take care of it with different varieties of your choice at S$9.80 with a drink.If the listed drink doesn't sayisfy you, you can add $1 to choose the one you desire. I chose my tart with nuts and caramel and it came with strawberry and banana.To enjoy my tart I chose the Japanese yuzu peach tea which was light and it complemented my tart well. A good resting place after a tiring shopping spree

This is one of the best fruit tarts I ever try in my life so far. Highly recommended the banana chocolate tarts. It is so delicious. The drink like coffee and soda is also very good. A good cafe for stop after some good shopping in the mall there

Love the fruit tarts here, they always looks so pretty and appetising, looks like they are waving at me and asking me to eat them.... most of the time, i have to give it to the temptation...well, they do taste fresh, with lots of fresh fruits plus the fresh tart cookies and the yummy cream... it is hard to not love them!Weekday they always have this tea time promo , $9.80++ for a slice of tart and drinks...Service is not so great when i visit, it was a weekday so probably less staff... well, doesn't really matter as long as the food is good!We took the opportunity to re-visit SEA Aquarium as they are having a buy one free one ticket for Wednesday!http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/11/eat-and-play-wednesday-sea-aquarium.htm

premise - simple and basic. very utilitarianlocation - vivocity = tonnes of parkingstaff - we just grabbed an empty seat and ordered via the ipad.... not much human interaction except for a manager that was smiling when serving and a grouchy Filipino serving us the drinkscrowd - applicable to everyone? hahaha.... it is!food - LOVE the tarts..... awesome stuff. i knew i ingested at least 50 million kcals, but worth itverdict - come 1 come all. and get fat together. and u know what, after finishing everything on the plate, u know that you want to get fatter cos these buggers are WORTH every Kcal

Passed Fruit Paradise Cafe many times when in Singapore but wasn't until saw a food programme which happened to showcase milk/dessert products from Hokkaido...Fruit Paradise Cafe was quickly put on a list of food places to visit this time round. We were not disappointed. The tarts were creamy and light and just pure heaven on a plate. The service was good and a very very pleasant experience and one we will for sure experience again when next in beautiful Singapore

Was in Bedok Mall looking for something to eat when we chanced upon Fruit Paradise Cafe at Basement 1.Was interesting to see the wall display of all the very colorful fruit tarts and fruits. They looked too good to resist.We had no regrets. There were various types of fruit tarts to choose from besides some Japanese rice dishes and drinks.There was a weekday special comprising fruit tart and choice of drink at $9.80 per set. We ordered the mango tart set as well as a milk puff. However the milk puff was sold out and we switched to nutty caramel tart.Love the mango tart with the sweet mangoes in light cheese mousse. The nutty caramel came with salty caramel cream on sponge cake with caramalized mixed nuts and fresh fruits such as bananas and strawberries.Hubby loved the tarts so much that he ordered another set. This time, he tried the chocolate banana tart which came with fresh bananas and almond flakes on chocolate base. Thought this was a little too creamy but hubby liked it as well.:

We popped in at FPC for dessert after a nice dinner at the Raffles Mall food court and ordered fruit tarts and cappucinos. I have never seen a fruit tart that looked sooooo perfect! I thought it was a plastic mould in the cabinet. This gorgeous custard flan/cake was wonderfully light and the fruit flavours were divine, not too sweet but very delicious. It was heavenly! Yum!Cappucinos were good too. Next time I will return and try the fruit teas..

First time had Japanese Fruits Tarts in Singapore. Good quality and range of selections cater to our needs.The the value set with a cup of salon tea with a tart at $8.90 only. Otherwise, you pay $7.90 for a tart & tea at $3.90They also serving fruits tea with fresh fruit. But the tea pot need pay more attention in cleaning before serving the customers.Tips: look the the value set at $8.90 only
