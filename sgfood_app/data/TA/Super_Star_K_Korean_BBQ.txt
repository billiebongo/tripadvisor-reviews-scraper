Located in a popular area filled with many other Korean bbq restaurant, this outlet serve authentic taste bbq with friendly staff ready to help ..streamed egg & black pepper pork is really nice! Worthy of a try..

My first taste of Korean food. Loved the format with fresh BBQ being cooked in each table. Loved the pork belly and the extra hot dishes along with the sides. And of course the lemony shots to accompany the meat. Great service.

Cold outside and it is past lunchtime, it is about 2:30pm, not busy at all, only few tables have people seated, so I thought it will be nice to have a quick hot and spicy soup to warm up a bit. Ordered a sea food &tofu hot and spicy soup. Disappointed when I saw the size of the soup, small bowl, half full as well, not very spicy either, no prawns inside. After they served my soup, nobody asked me if I am ok, if I like the soup, nobody to tell I would like some salt and pepper, because the soup was rather tasteless and not even 1 prawn (my favourite). For Â£8.50 the price of the soup, I expected far more than that. Even China town is a better choice.

It was a very authentic korean BBQ restaurant with good quality meat - be it pork or beef/ marinated or original. Kimchi soup, Kimchi pancake, seafood pancake were really yummy too. The Korean BBQ order came with the steam eggs, one of the highlight to me

party of 4 went to the circular quay outlet for lunch. as usual place is crowded and always with people waiting inline. we had army stew, seafood pancake and steam egg. the army stew soup is better than another we went but the ingredients has a lot less meat in it compared to the other but this is made up by the soup base. serving staff are not willing to serve extra portion of side which is usually generous in Korean food culture. the minute we stop eating we were kinda asked to leave
3
There are 3 outlets in Tanjong pagar, be sure to check which outlet you booked. service is good, the staff refill the side dish frequently upon request. They will BBQ the meat and keep an eye so they meat won't be overcook.We can focus on eating :) Food is consistent but not outstanding. My only negative feedback for this place is the meat portion is slight small and each portion cost $30+, not so value for money. Average spend per person (for 5 ladies) is $55 with soju included
4
I had eaten there an taken away a few times, food tastes very good, surprising for a chain restaurant, doesn't feel like one.They use MSG, thy said no, my friend let them know he gets rushes and discomfort so they said yes it's used is all soups and other dishes. So he ordered something else instead

Super star Korean BBQ is a chain restaurant with several outlets, each differing slightly in standard and service. For me, I like the Clarke Quay outlet the most. But every outlet is not bad. This is above average Korean BBQ amongst others in Singapore. In the TP area, I would most often dine at Super star for Korean BBQ. Meat is good, not great but really loved the steamed egg and seafood pancake. Servers don't speak too much English...well the Korean ones but they kinda cool better. So put up with the language barrier ya

Had dinner at this K BBQ joint with family and friends. It's no fine dining (that's not what they are going for) but the food was very flavorful and the service was prompt and friendly. We really enjoyed it and hope to go back before we leave

Went super star k once early of this month. Found few outlets with same name in a same street, was actually confused which outlet we had visited, haha. Overall food was ok, sides were ok, service was ok. Few types of beer were available. The staffs were kind enough to allow us to bring in fried chickens from other shops, bt not the alcohol. Overall is in my ok-to-go lis

The ramyeun was awesome!! Meat was good but expensive :( they have free egg too!! And everything is clean and importantly its charcoal grill BBQ! Normal bbq shops are lately using electric BBQ instead! Overall I would recommend this place!

I've been here before and we enjoyed our visit then but went again last night and found it to be devoid of customers and staff disinterested. What's really annoying is that I passed several other great Korean restaurants but wanted to go here again, what a mistake. The host, perhaps owner was not welcoming at all and the only time he expressed some energy was presenting the bill to see if we'd leave a tip, a first time for me that I didn't. Do yourself a favor and try to other shops on this great foodie street, this one is a sleeper zzzz

This outlet of Superstar K is our Favourite. They have another outlet just down hr street to cope with demand but stick to this as there is just something that makes it special. I would only give the other outlet 3.5stars . We are regulars and highly recommend the unmarinated beef ribs and kimchi soup. 2 pax will set you back 85 sgd but the quality of the meat is fantastic and will beat other steak restaurants because it is cooked over charcoal instead of gas. Highly recommend this place If you are a tourist. But prepared that your clothes will smell and not appropriate for a hot date that u intent to score...

i wanted to try some Korean BBQ food while i am in Singapore. The following are my likes and dislike:What I like:1-Its seasoned beef ribs ;It wasn't tough2-Its staffs' help with bbqing the food3-one could go shop around after obtaining one's queuing number; you would get a call from the restaurant to say your table is ready.4-Unlimited serving of side dishes 5- You would received a free bowl of steamed eggs if you order 2 meaty dishes. What i didn't like: 1- too cram; we were only half an arm length from the next table; too close for comfort2- we were sitting on stools which were very uncomfortable3-table were small; we had difficulty finding room on the table to put our food, bowls , chops sticks etc4- I ordered a Korean sausage with rice soup . i was surprised when it arrived; there wasn't any sausages in sight but pigs' intestines (found out from its staff) Note: due to it being a cram restaurant plus pipping hot food and hot charcoal were about i do feel this restaurant is not suitable for young children. I also didn't see any room left in this restaurant for strollers

Went with my friends and 1 of them is a Korean. She enjoyed the BBQ very much and mentioned it's 1 of the best that she had tasted in Singapore. Cold noodle was not available for ordering as she was craving for cold noodle.Had 2 bottles of soju after meal. Pricing for the food and the sojus are a little expensive than I had anticipated
4
Found this restaurant online, and thinking to check it out with friend. We reached there around 7.30pm and there already a queue waiting. But the good thing is we no need to queue it the ordinary way...stand there and wait. There's a machine outside, what you need to do is just key in your name, phone no. and no. of paxes.Then you can just feel free to take a stroll at other places, while waiting for the restaurant to call you when there is table available :) We have tried the seasoned pork neck, seasoned spicy chicken and pancake,with 2 bottle of soju and 1 bottle of hite beer (i was thinking the hite beer still at $7/ bottle promo at first, another reason for me to choose this restaurant at the first place..but too bad , the promo no more..) . The foods tasted good! And the staff will help you to "BBQ" the meats, what you need to do is just wait, the lady who help us cooked the meat was very friendly and helpful. The meal came with ordinary korean "ban chan" (side dish) and a nice steam egg! If you are not a big eater, and with the no.of pax not more than two, then i think 2 meats plus a soup / pancake, will be a quite stuffed and satisfied dinner for you and your friendThe only dissapointed part is when saw the meats came in a small portion (i'm expected a little bit more with the price they put), a bit pricey. Except this, others thing are all good~the environment, the food, the service and the staffs. It's nice place for friends to chill ou

With a city/state like Singapore, where it is really expensive to eat already, Super Star insists on single customers buying 2 covers. Now, how are you going to eat 2 peoples' food...and of course pay double! That's why I think this is a poor customer approach - and I don't care that others do it too; it isn't right
5
This was my third time visiting Super Star K. I really love the side dishes (especially the potato salad), the well-marinated meat and the steam egg! The waiters are very friendly too!Yes, you will definitely need a bath after eating as you will smell of charcoal!Will be back for more next time

We visited the restaurant for dinner based on a Korean friend's recommendation. On arrival , we were directed to another branch a few steps ahead - the menu was absolutely similar.We ordered spicy chicken , pork ribs and some spicy pork soup. Loved the BBQ (staff were great to help !!) We couldn't help order another round of raw meat (beef this time) for BBQ and loved it even more !!The service stands out too !! I would highly recommend this restaurant any day for enjoying the best Korean BBQ in Singapore !! Don't miss it !

The food was good. The waiter assumed because we are white that we did not know how to cook the food, and thus cooked it for us, but never bothered to ask us or explain what the dishes that came with the meat choices were. She was also very jittery and was yelling at some other employee in the back, which made us feel quite uncomfortable. The whole experience was quite uncomfortable to be honest. Price wise you should know that they add 17% tax +service to the total. The food is also pretty expensive for the amount given, although all the prices are on the menu for one to see. Like mentioned, the food was good, but in conclusion I think it is too expensive for the quality and amount, and the service is subpar
2
Seafood pan cake is 29 sgd and 10% service fee ,and another 7% gST! 100 for 2 person , the price it's ........ Aggressive !service just ok
4
Simple, healthy, tasty fare and reasonably priced; the staff were friendly, the environment was pleasing, and the place was clean - I will definitely be going back.
5
First time eating in a restaurant like this and I will repeat. Helpful staff who turned and cut meat for us.
Pleasant atmosphere.
Good time had.

The street and district of Tanjong Pagar is packed by Korean BBQs. SuperStar deserves its name. Great atmosphere and easy going people for a good night out with friends. Strongly can recommend the Kimchi Stew. Further meats all good and quality.

Went with family and friends and the food was simply awesome....! The Black Pepper Beef was the highlight of the evening, followed by the tasty Belly Pork
and then the mouthwatering Spicy Pork....!
4
it was really packed but we simply love the food especially the steamed egg. Waited for what seems like forever for a table though. Would strongly advised to skip weekends. They are open for lunch now though! Spicy chicken was my favourite! Spicy & good! The downside was we reek of BBQ smell after :
5
Staffs are friendly, food are delicious and fresh. Love the steam egg so much, we must order every time we go. I don't eat beef but all my friends said the beef is tender and nicely cook, best place to eat beef. I like the pork too, attendance there make sure the meat are not over cooked. Love the spicy seafood & tofu soup too. A must go place

Went for BBQ lunch on a Sunday at K2 outlet (circular road) and this makes it a plus point as the restaurant is not crowded at all. Service is good and fast too as at a point in time, ours is the only table being occupied in the restaurant. The staff bbq the food and serve us readily. We ordered chicken (2 times), pork jowl (2 times) and pork neck and some other stuff.. total cost is around $160 for 4 pax which i guess it's still worth it since the food is nice compared to some korean buffet bbq food. Recommended for people who wants an authentic taste for Korean bbq food :

Very well marinated meat! Love the BBQ chicken & also the spicy chicken alot! The most ultimate was actually the steamed egg as a side. Could never get enough of it. Awesome services provided by the team of crews there. Apart from the reek of BBQ smell, everything else was great! Be prepared to wait during dinner hours especially on weekends too! Thanks for being so SUPER

Restaurant is not crowded which is an added point, we came on a Saturday afternoon 12pm. Food is good, service is OK as there was only one other table occupied when we arrived. Price wise it was on the higher side, overall recommended for die hard Korean Food fans
4
Food was excellent. Genuine small Korean restaurant, with state of the art barbecue tables. Small, unassuming, but very friendly.
4
Food was of good quality, place was small but buzzing with young people. Located in the Tanjong Pagar area near Chinatown along rows of Korean eateries. If you want a break from cheap fast food, it is worthwhile visiting this place.

Had a good meal at this Korean restaurant.Venue - Tanjong Pagar Mrt station exit A. Its just behind Orchid Hotel.Food - We had the Ginseng soup, Pork Neck, the more expensive cut of Beef and 3 layer pork. If you like soft type of pork, go for the pork neck, it was very yummy and we had round 2 of it. The 3 layer pork is good too. Refillable side dishes.Service - Had a pleasant lady who turn and cut the meat for us. Atmosphere - Korean style table ( you can find plenty of this style in Korea .... ( I like ) )Is it smoky ? - Not to us and the restaurant was full. Do go early on weekend.Verdict ~ Will visit again....

Went early on a week night to avoid the after work crowd. Got in easily, and even when we left at 20:00 there were empty tables. The charcoal grilling really elevates the grilled meat to another level. Small side dishes, but still came away happy. The minium order of meats is nota problem. Servers could use a few days in charm school, but the good food trumphs their gruff attitude

I came here on a Friday raining evening with my girl friend. The restaurant was full when we arrived and we need to get a Q-no. to be put on the wait list. I like the Auto-Q system machine that is placed outside the restaurant. We simply just need to key our mobile number and the machine will pop up a Q number and we just need to wait for them to call us when there a table available for us. The ambience was good. We ordered pork belly, chicken meats, kimchi soup and Makgeolli (Korean rice beer). They gave us complementary steamed egg and a few sides dishes (bean sprouts, anchovies, potato salad and sliced fish cakes). They use charcoal for the grill which make the food taste nicer. The food quality was good. The service staff are very friendly and they even grilled the meat for us. I definitely will re-visit this place again. This restaurant is along Tanjong Pagar road thus it not easy to find parking lot if driving. My advise is to take public transport or taxi

I'm coming here more and more often. Every time I get to know new super tasty menu items and the service is really great. They take care of you, your drinks and also the meat on your grill, your only job is to enjoy the wonderful food. The small dishes you get around are very nice, especially the steamed egg

Went to this restaurant to try after hearing good reviews and good reviews. Internet reviews can never be trusted, have to be selective when you read the reviews.When i visit the place, already expected a queue. The staff is rude when asking to wait. Order food and drinks. Beef is good quality, expect no seasoning. Extremely over price, 5 thin long slices of short ribs beef for $28 and 2 slices of chicken for $18. (see photo) Drinks only came 45 mins later after we ask twice. Will never come back again. There are better korean bbq with more reasonable price and friendly service staff

I been there few times already since 2013. Based on my understanding, this restaurant is run and own by a Korean family. The food overall is quite good, but the services is very worse and bad. Just last year, when the service began to eat give me a good impression will smile at least. Now they are very stingy to give a smile, not friendly, not cordial. Even the stuff and the owner if the restaurant. I Will find an other Korean restaurant, at least I'I I eat happily .

We have been to Superstar K a few times in Tanjong Pagar and have always been very pleased with the service, quality and taste of the dishes. Based on those past experiences we ordered takeaway from Superstar K's Telok Ayer branch namely kimchi jigae (kimchi stew) and doenjang jigae (bean paste stew). Turned out to be a big disappointment. Both stews had hardly any ingredients inside -- meagre morsels of meat, a few slices of cucumber and tofu bits countable with digits on each hand. In fact, we thought we had picked up someone's leftovers by mistake. While we haven't dined in at the Telok Ayer branch, we thought this experience was a terrible 1st impression. Saving grace was the very polite waitress who spoke over the phone with my girlfriend. We decided to send them photos of the rather sad looking "leftovers". We sincerely hope they will improve

Korean BBQ restaurants seem to be the trend in Singapore now. Located at Tanjong Pagar, Superstar K is definitely worth a try for Korean BBQ, as their complementary side dishes are delicious as well as the quality cuts of meat used. The waiters even grill the meat for you!Although not as cheap as BBQ buffet like 2D1N, you don't have to queue for hours like buying Hello Kitty either and squeeze with K-pop crazy teens at the buffet table.For the full story as well as more photos, check out my review at:http://sethlui.com/food-review-superstar-k-korean-bb
