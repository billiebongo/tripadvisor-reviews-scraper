The restaurant is located near Bugis and within walking distance from nearby bus stops. The restaurant is a great place for gathering and for family. Food are really good at reasonable prices

If you are exploring new places to visit, KINS is definitely the place to go. Lured by the pork steak promotion, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the pork steak was. I thoroughly enjoyed how juicy and tender the meat was.

The pork chop is very nice! Will definitely visit again. The environment is very quite too, best to go with friends or couples

This was my second time dining at KINS and their food never disappoints. Excellent food and customer service. Also, the lunch set is value for money!

We felt the warm and cosiness of the restaurant. The food is good and really value for money. We've a variety of main course and starter, especially the fries with truffle sauce. The owner, Louis, and his parents did the serving and we really felt like having dinner in our own home. Immediately after our dinner, my brother in law made reservation to bring his friends the next day. This shows how good it is and I'll be bringing my friends there soon

Have been to Kins quite a number of times.Food is good as usual, I liked their beef carpaccio.Chef is accommodative to our request - requested for carbonara with less salt and no bacon for my kids as don't want them to have processed food. Chef replaced the bacon with mushrooms and offered to serve the carbonara on 2 plates for my 2 kids who were sharing

The portion of the thick cut fries is big~ like their mushroom soup~ kinda disappointed with the specialty pork steak as the meat seems to be overcooked, it's tough~ The sauce is good though~Good thing is the food price is nett and there is free wifi and it's near a pokestop~ :

The striploin steak was substandard (not well seasoned!) and tough although we ordered medium done. The Pork Steak was delicious though, with nice sauce and good meat. On a side note, their sides (mashed potato, and garlic mushrooms) were very delectable!Food could have been served faster. We waited quite a long while although the other tables were already fully served

We ordered pork steak, salmon and crabmeat pasta. The food was nice and the portion was decent. When we were there for lunch it was still quiet and not very crowded, hence, making it a good place for a good catch up with friends and family.

A really neat café along the artsy aliwal street! The food was absolutely DELICIOUS, we ordered the carbonara and pork steak (chope exclusive at $10). So, even with our drinks total bill for 2 only came to $28. Super value for money since no service charge nor GST. The ambience and décor of the café is lovely too. Had a great time, will come back again for the carbonara ^.
