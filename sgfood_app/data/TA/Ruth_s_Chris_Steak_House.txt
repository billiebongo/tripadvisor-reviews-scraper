Steaks are a must here with a good choice of cuts. A surprise wow factor is definitely the cheese cake dessert, one of the best around. A very big portion good for two or three diners to share
5
From the service to the drinks and the food. All round yummy and definitely worth coming back. Pricing is decent for a good piece of steak and they were so accomodating to my infant son
5
Another visit, another great meal. Steaks are really good -best in Singapore for my money. Sides likewise. Fantastic onion rings (for example). Top wine list. Finally - great, unobtrusive service. Never disappoints, this place.
5
We had very nice steak for our business lunch. It’s just simply juicy and delicious. The crab cake, lobster bisque, and baked potato were nice as well. Service very good , very Ruth’s Chris.
5
We had the crabcakes and scallop for appetiser, and they were AWESOME!
For steak, we ordered the filet and ribeye, and they were juicy and tender.
4
Inside the Mandarin Hotel, it looks as the other Ruth's Chris around the world. The environment is less "warm" than elsewhere. Very expensive and very good meat. Good wine list.
5
Efficient, welcoming, and knowledgeable staff, together with top-quality food and drinks. Highly recommended.

It was a birthday celebration and we love the steak here. The service is pretty good and the portion is just right. The price is steep but it is worth it. We love the crab cake too. The dessert is just so-so. Ambience is good. Their sour dough bread and whipped butter that goes with it is heavenly
5
Finally we had a chance to visit this place. This upmarket steakhouse features modern settings with wood panel walls, sleek black leather chairs Nd thick carpets. We ordered the asparagus salad and the crab and corn chowder. Both were excellent. Of course for the mains we had the ribeye that is well marbled and deliciously juicy. Our son had the NY strip which is slightly firmer but still tender and flavorful. A satisfying steak dinner.
4
The service was good and the food was yummy. I couldn't finish then steak but it was great. One note is that the steak needed more salt when cooking. It was great but an extra sprinkle of salt when cooking would have taking us into stunning.The apple pie was awesome. Wines have you even more heart palpations than all that steak but selected an okay bottle for $180.Worth a visit when someone else is paying
5
This is easily the best Steak i have had in Singapore. Although expensive but it’s fulfilling and juicy. Ambience is amazing as well
4
Given the prices everything must be perfect in delighting clients. I did not feel that. I felt lile a normal guest at a high end expensive restaurant leaving wondering if rhis is rwally worth it.
4
service was great as well as the food. Decoration is a classic steakhouse you will find that it will never go wrong, with strong emphasis on food as well.
5
Had the classic set menu. All the items were wonderful and portion was good too! I wouldn't have thought value for money would be the phrase I would use for a place like this but this certainly was. I can't wait to go back.
5
It was a birthday lunch celebration for a friend who is there for her first time.
The experience was awesome. Quality food and attentive service staff. We would definitely come back again!
5
The Filipino gentleman that was served our table was attentive friendly without being imposing. The sizzling ribeye is juicy and satisfying as always. Glad to see restaurant filling up! Would be perfect if corkage is slightly lower n if the lovely cheesecake comes in a smaller portion. Weâ€™ll be back! Thank you
5
We came here to celebrate my bf's birthday and we have to say the quality of the steak from Ruth Chris has been consistently outstanding. This has been a place of confidence whenever we like to enjoy a good steak. Not to mention to service from the staff is friendly and helpful
5
Had a meet up session with friend i hadn't seen in a long time and being meat lovers, we decided to pay a visit to Ruth Chris. We ordered 1 Salad, 1 Starter, 1 big Steak, 1 side and 1 dessert. All to share and we left very satisfied. So for noobs at Ruth Chris, beware the portion sizes. they are big. And our steak wasn't even the really big one!Tastewise, it was classic steakhouse fare, simply presented and very yummy. the genrous use of butter also made everything rich and unctuous. meat lovers owe it to themselves to give this place a try
4
We had dinner there a few week ago to celebrate a special occasion. Overall, it was very satifying. The foods, drinks and services were great. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The red wine was very nice and the desert was also very nice. Will do again very soon
1
I took my family for dinner and ordered two dinner sets. One Steak was overcooked and my rump tasted oily and had a taste of sourness to it.We couldn't finish both and made a suggestion to the waiter. The manager came later assure us that both steaks are fresh and tasty. All my family agreed never to go back there again. Especially we chosen this restaurant over the Moreton steakhouse nearby.Its pricy and i will not recommend this place to anyone
5
Went there with the family for a birthday celebration. Always a favorite for special occasions. Kids are welcome too
5
Excellent place for beef lovers.
There's a distinctive butter fragrance on the steak when served. I ordered medium rare, which melts in your mouth. The 12oz premium ribeye seemed much bigger than anticipated, and all the side dishes were huge.

We asked around for a good steak restaurant in Singapore, and this place was mentioned. We didn't book, and as we entered I could see that we didn't need to, as we were the only ones there.!! The first thing that astonished us was the price, probably 3 times the expected for Singapore. But we thought that such a high price must mean its good quality - we couldn't be more wrong. The staff were pleasant enough, but didn't engage and make us welcome. We ordered of the set menu, and started with two salads. The first;(asparagus) had 3 small spears of asparagus and the rest was simply a pile of leafy greens. The other salad was (supposed to be) a Caesar, it was little more than a plate of chopped up iceberg lettuce and a few croutons. Never mind we thought, steak to come. We ordered the best quality lean steak (well done) - what arrived would have had a street dog turn his nose up. It was cheap, nasty, fatty and one was almost raw (not well done as requested) - they had tried to hide its poor quality by covering it in pepper. The accompanying vegetables were no less awful. We then waited for desert, which was again a huge disappointment. Overall, this was probably the worst meal I've had in Singapore (or anywhere for that matter) and would advise everyone to stay away. We dont like to make a scene, so didn't complain. But you would have thought they knew our displeasure as all the meals were taken away barely half eaten. I even think the waiter was embarrassed delivering a bill for slightly under $400. We probably shouldn't have paid
2
Came here for lunch with highly recommended reviews. Ordered appetizer scallop and crab cakes. A porterhouse, a filet Mignon and lamp chops. The appetizer were good but the steaks were a total disappointment. We came with high expectations and ordered the best cut filet Mignon but the meat turned out abit mashy and powdery. The porterhouse has no sizzling juicy feel to it. The lamp chops were abit dry. The meat really failed us.
3
This place really doesn’t live up to the expectations of the Ruth’s Chris brand, in fact I would say that the Ruth’s Chris experience is non-existent.As a steak house it is OK, the food was good.Do not visit expecting the Ruth’s Chris level of charm, service, presentation or quality
5
We are repeat customers of this restaurant. And having tried the dry-aged steak in Chicago recently, wet-aged steak in Ruth's Chris is of a different flavour. Alot of the seasoning matters in this case. I would say this is worth a try and the kitchen has added value to the steak with well-proportioned seasoning. The meat is juicy and flavourful.This doesn't disappoint.
3
Yes it's a Ruth's Chris steak house but it wasn't amazing as in USA! The NY rib steak meat was tender and delicious but the side dishes nothing special (simple purée and spinach with cheese). The meals are really very expensive over priced for the service and quality! We came half an hour before closing, they didn't say us anything, but they have served as very quickly. When you are paying to pay over 300€ (without wine) for dinner for two persons you are expecting minimum of attention and quality of dishes!

Firstly, this place is only for beef eaters. Second, you will really appreciate this place only if you seek top (note I did not say good) quality steaks.Otherwise, you will be thoroughly disappointed with it's menu and price (The word Steak House is in the name).It's in marina Mandarin, so obviously the decor is brilliant and the service top-notch. They only serve USDA beef (no Wagyu here), but it's probably the best US beef you can have in Singapore. Price-wise, it's on the higher side, but then compared to the high-end steak houses in Singapore, it's on the level. Taste - phenomenal. I always try the rib eye and share it (it suits two people just fine) and it is always done to perfection and served on a plate of smelting buttery goodness.Try some of the appetizers, especially crab cake - they are hearty and flavorful.You can go their with friends, family, date, double date or special occasions. It's suited for everything (as long as you are a beef lover).Revisit Like hood : I already have been there 3 times. So, go figure the chances :

Hubby and I felt like having steak and I heard that there is a Ruth's Chris just recently. Since we've been to many steak places in the past and all of them were so-so, we decided to give it a try, since we had a very good experience at Ruth's Chris in NY a couple of months ago. We were not disappointed. I had the petite filet, my husband went for the same with shrimp and we ordered the potatoes au gratin and the grilled asparagus as sides. OMG it was delicious! Definitely the best steak we had in Singapore and in a long time. It's not cheap though, but it was really worth it. Will definitely be back shortly for more! Also, service was very good and prompt, a perfect Saturday night! Thank you

Went to have dinner with my friends. Overall ambience is ok as there are only a few tables occupied on the night we went. Service is good however the staff did not forewarn that the steak plate is very hot. The meat cut for the price is on the steep side.
5
Excellent restaurant, wonderful food and attentive and friendly staff. It is too bad they don't offer a happy hour as they do in the USA. I would definitely recommend to others.
5
Nice ambience, good service, spot-on Caesar salad, tasty vegetables, perfect steaks, delicious creme brulee for dessert. Great dinner and now our favourite in Singapore.
4
Great resfauarant with poor personal attention and service. No smile no personality and most dont really understand the menu anx themes..
1
My steak was great! Selected the place mainly due to location. This is a steak house so why not order the overpriced filet lunch deal ($65) that comes with ... well a dash of butter. Fair that ordering a steak is just a steak (if this was in Italian place!) but a bit of garnish would be in place. We ordered two side dishes to share - nothing spectacular. My steak was indeed rare as requested, a feat not a lot of places can manage. However, my guest's steaks, requested medium, was very well done - and even served on a hot plate to further cook it! We should have complained but really could not be bothered to wait around as we only had planned a quick lunch. A streak place that cannot manage the basics was the impression we were left with. We are not in the 80th anymore! Steak in itself is really not regarded high end! A much better steak experience can be had for the same money at Equinox just across the road. My money go there next time. Total bill was just shy of $300 for lunch for three (Including two soft drinks).
5
Have been to the Singapore Ruth Chris many times and the steaks, food, and atmosphere is outstanding. By far our go to steak house with amazing wine in Singapore - no one can even come close to this in Singapore. Always we are met with outstanding service with attention to detail. Going again tonight.....see you there

If I were to choose one word to describe the Ruth's Chris franchises, it would be inconsistent. There are those that truly feel like a luxury steakhouse (Denver), and those that are woefully funereal and subpar (either Atlanta eatery). I suppose the Singapore restaurant is somewhere in between. The setting is posh; the wine list is vast; and the food is mostly up to RC standard (save for the Harvest Salad - which lacked cheese and featured stale, nay soggy, cajun pecans). However, the service was truly regrettable. If you are going to drop 1000 Sing dollars on dinner for three, you should be fawned over - just a little. Instead we felt rushed throughout the entire meal (though there was no wait and we did have a reservation). Appetizers + salads were served all at once, and there was no time for lingering before the main courses were plopped in front of us. Our waiter seemed to be omnipresent (in a hovering kind of way), yet often too apprehensive to approach the table. He seemed, at best, resigned and tolerant. And at worst, just in a hurry for us to pay the bill and leave so he could go home
5
Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, I had a filet while my friend had a ribeye. The steaks were very nicely done and we were satisfied with it. We also had crab cakes to share and a cheesecake for dessert after that. I personally loved the cheesecake and I would comeback here again when celebrating some special occassion

Went to Ruth chris for my anniversary celebration this year, was contemplating between going to my usual hunt of Morton's of Chicago or to give this a shot, my husband and I decided to give Ruth's a try to see if it is comparable. Started off with a confirmation from the steakhouse about one week before my reservation, i felt the person over the phone could have been a little friendlier as she sounded a little monotone when I asked if they had taken note of my request for a more cosy seat away from the public since I was going to celebrate my anniversary. She said they noted the request. That dampened the mood a little as she sounded like they didn't really bother that the occasion was special, so fingers crossed before the special day. The day we went to the restaurant, the ambiance was not what I expected, too well lit, was expecting dimmer lighting for more mood, but it was bright and not as cosy as Morton's. We were given a booth seat just beside a table of 4 people, oh well, so much for the privacy. The first impression really wasn't very impressive. There was no special notes on the table congratulating the occasion, unlike Morton's. The last time I brought my husband to Morton's for his birthday, they customised a menu with his name on it! This time in Ruth, no special set up for surprise, just a normal dinner feel. Ordered their cow boy steak and new York steak, braised mushrooms and casear salad. The new York steak came and both my husband and i felt the steak was overly salty. We tasted the cow boy steak and it was fine, told the service staff about it, they brought it back to try it themselves and came to tell me it's their norm to have it seasoned that way. We suspected the chef smokes, so preferred his steak more salty. As for the service staff who tasted as well and agreed it was not salty, it might be because they didn't want to offend the chef. Oh well, then why was the cowboy steak not as salty if the standard was like the new York steak? Does it mean then that the cow boy steak was not seasoned properly according to their standards? We felt a little offended when they came back to tell us it tasted fine to them. As if they were telling us indirectly that we were the ones with the strange taste buds. But nevertheless, they 'offered' to replace another new York for us without salt this time, and even though it still tasted like there was salt in it (possibly because either the chopping board or the pan already had some salt leftover from the last piece of steak), it tasted like the cow boy steak this time. Portions were huge, we felt we ordered too much steak, and could have been better off ordering just one steak to share with perhaps another main instead. Ruth's gave us a little surprise towards the end with an anniversary cake, but when served, service staff did not indicate that the cake was on the house, just served to us as if we ordered it. We had to ask if it was on the house as we didn't want to take things for granted. Overall experience, service could have been better if they had been able to emphathise with the customer. Being a fine dining restaurant, they do not bring out the essence of personalised service. It would have been better if the restaurant had just changed the steak without commenting that the steak was actually cooked to their norm when their other steak was obviously less salty. That made us question ourselves if they actually do have a standard themselves. Salad was pretty good, but not over the tops, braised mushrooms was not fantastic, didn't finish that. Plating was quite terrible for a fine dining. Just a piece of meat on a sizzling white plate. Overall presentation of food, we've seen much better. Probably won't be back for more. Morton's would still be preferred for the more personalised service, more smiles over there as well. Spent about the same amount as I would at Morton's. Ambiance would have been better at Morton's, food tasted better at Morton's, no sent back steak which was too salty there too. Presentation of food is definitely better as well. Oh well.. didn't felt super happy like when I was at Morton's, but probably an experience to know which is better now

Everything was delicious. The appetizer crab cakes were chock full of fresh crab meat. The lobster bisque was rich with a hint of brandy. The highlight of the meal, the steaks of course, were perfectly seasoned and served on sizzling hot plates which kept them warm more than halfway through the steaks. Even the asparagus and Hollandaise sauce were on point. If I had to complain about one item, it would be the dessert. Whilst the chocolate molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream was delicious enough, I felt the chocolate used could be of richer and the cake slightly denser, perhaps in a smaller portion to balance the richness. But that's really my personal preference for desserts. Service was great too, and ambience was nice and relaxing. We will definitely be back
5
Based on Internet Advice I went there for a Steak and got a great one made perfect to order. The staff was very kind and attentive. Prices are not unsubstantial and the surroundings of the Marina Mandarin in terms of architecture are debatable. Doesn't take anything away from the food, though
5
We went here to Celebrate a birthday. The food was wonderful. My husband ordered the steak with asparagus on the side. I ordered the crab cakes. We enjoyed a fine red wine. Fantastic evening. Amazing service
5
This is our go to spot for the best and I mean the best steak and associated food with outstanding wine. It is on the more pricier side but worth every penny of this excellent restaurant.
Cheers!

Dinner on Friday night, steak n food was good but the services weren't good as my Friend didn't have the clear reminder about the hot plate n accidentally burt his fingers .. , the waiter wasn't offer any assistance n just stood there ... disappearing evening .

In all the years if travelling around the world, staying in some of the best hotels and eating in some of the finest restaurants, this was actually my very first experience of a Ruth's Chris Steak House. And I have to admit to being seriously impressed! It wasn't the quality of the steak so much - a good steak is a good steak - it was the whole concept. Red hot plates, good menu choice, excellent sides, efficient but unobtrusive service. Put simply: High class comfort food!Between the five of us dining, two of us had steaks, one had lamb chops and one had a starter (foie gras) as a main course. I had the stuffed chicken breast, which has to rank as one of the best chicken dishes I've ever experienced. The two diners who had the steaks enjoyed them, although in both cases they felt that the centers were a bit more red than they would have ideally liked (not un-typical as steak houses tend towards meat that should still be mooing in the field!).Desserts were wonderful - crème brulee was about as perfect as you could get (it didn't need the unnecessary fruit bits on top - a good crème brulee stands on its own, unadulterated!).Really the only slight disappointment was the bread service. One type of bread and not very inspiring. On the other hand, sensible (large!) butter portions - something many restaurants overlook.This Ruth's Chris is located within the Marina Mandarin opposite Suntec

Had lunch with a colleague and a client. Had the gumbo to start, the ahi tuna stack as my main and the 3 of us shared the Apple crumble and bread pudding. The gumbo was nice but a tad salty so I would suggest asking for less salt if you're like me. The tuna stack was wonderful. Would definitely order it again. The desserts were huge. Good thing the 3 of us shared 2 desserts. The Apple crumble was very good but the bread pudding was a little cold which wasn't really to my liking. With 2 glasses of wine, the meal (my companions also had starters and mains) cost almost $600. While the quality of the food was undoubted, at almost $200 per head for lunch, it was a little on the pricey side. Not surprising there were only about 4 tables that were filled. Service was excellent as you would expect
3
Ruth's Chris Steak House is inside the Marina Mandarin, but not part of the hotel. The food is very well prepared and presented, with very attentive staff.I went there with a colleague after we decided not to go for the $60 per head buffet in the hotel, which we could not justify since we only wanted a very light meal. We had a small entree each and a very small salad, which was exactly what we wanted and very satisfying.To my great surprise the bill came to $140. I know I saw the prices on the menu, but we could have gone to the buffet with far greater choice, still had a very light meal and paid less
3
My wife and I have lived in Singapore for just over a year and like to treat ourselves to a night out occasionally. We're both huge lovers of steak (I'm Zimbabwean and we basically eat beef two days after coming out of the womb) The service is great, but for the price, it's not so incredibly memorable that I'd run back in a heart beat. I don't mind splashing out, but the experience should hit the mark and unfortunately this fell short.My wife and I shared:2 x petite filets (250g roughly)1 x mash1 x broccoli 1 x sautéed mushrooms1 x peppercorn and brandy sauce1 x still water (15 bucks a pop for Fiji water)1 x bottle of their cheapest Pinot NoirBill (after 17% taxes): SGD 497...As I said, the money isn't an issue if the experience is memorable and real value is had. I've eaten at quite a few steak restaurants around the city and this is definitely the most expensive we've encountered, even when compared to a "celebrity chef" restaurants... The dishes required better seasoning (I know this probably personal), and there weren't many sauces available for choice.You won't have a bad experience here, but value for money is what needs to be addressed for this to get a better rating
5
This was my fourth visit to Ruth with my family.. We had a wonderful time together enjoying good service and food. I mist say that Ruth is my favourite steakhouse in Singapore. I am particularly i pleased with the service . Unlike some high wnd restaurants , I was not pressured to order extra dishes.
5
Wowee it's been 3 days but I can still smell the perfect corn-fed marbled ribeye sizzling in front of me. It ain't cheap, but quality never is. The sides were magnificent too, wife fell in love with the sautéed potatoes in cream while I demolished the creamed spinach. Darn just writing this is making me drool! The weak point was probably the chopped salad, but it's a distant memory now. Meat 4eva

Awesome place for succulent steak!Our main orders were either ribeye or New York strip, all seared to perfection. Soft, juicy, tasty. Nicely paired with corn and fresh asparagus. However, what made the meal better was the appetizers of sizzling blue crab cakes and Ruth's chop salad. Plus, nothing better with the steaks than a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. Great meal. We ended our meal with desserts of chocolate lava cake and cheesecake with slices of strawberry and raspberry. Pricey meal but worth every penny.
4
It was a very nice surprise to have such quality steaks and to have such GREAT service. It's not cheap there and I know Ruth's Chris isn't but this one was really expensive.
4
Steak is marbled and tender; need a little more seasoning though. Crab cake is good - made with real crab meat. Dessert is awesome and huge.
4
Limited menu selections but the steak and chicken are tasty. Service of staff adds a personal touch. Place wasn't rowdy, hence suitable for small cozy celebration between couple or with small group of friends. 2 main course (without beverages) costs SGD160.
5
Great meal, the steaks are served on a sizzling plate, excellent, almost candle-light atmosphere, Service Level is average
4
Service was very attentive, felt really welcomed here. The crab cakes and prawn appetisers are sooo good, we wanted to lick the plate. Dessert portions are huge, so share one if you don't want to feel super stuffed.
3
I think I still prefer their competitor, Restaurant "M" better.
Their steaks are average.
Ambience is so so.
Service is ok.
5
I was so lucky and entered this restaurant at dinner time without reservation.Steak was great and I fully enjoyed it.Service was great too!
5
Service staff were all very polite and friendly. The food were amazing but you can give cream of spinach a miss. I love how their steaks were served in a hot plate!
5
Experienced two meals here in February and March whilst staying at the hotel. The restaurant is renowned for it's steaks but serves other dishes including seafood. On both occasions we chose the 16oz Ribeye and the staff were very amenable for us to share as it was so large. Accompanied by Gratin and baked potatoe and mushrooms all cooked to perfection. The service was exceptional on both occasions and the best we had experience around the world in a long time. Although expensive I would recommend for that special treat
5
Being only in town for a couple of days, I've managed to squeeze time off and enjoy a quiet dinner.The place still looks immaculate despite being opened for 5 years. Had the appletini which the barman, Wilfredo does perfectly with a garnish of apple star. My usual ribeye done to perfection served in a hot plate laced with butter and chopped parsley. Service was impeccable as I was dining alone, manager, Ezan came by to say hello and check if I was enjoying my steak. Attentive but yet not intrusive! For the money paid which was not cheap, I'd say it's worth it! I'll be back!
4
Warm Classic setup with friendly staff! Serving rustic cusine Which are very well done!! Had the shrimp cocktail and chop salad, and had 2 different steak to share. Portion wise was great!! Serve on hot plate!!
3
Just average.. no big Hooha .. Cut is still the best.. Wolfgang puck .. Ruth Chris is overrated.. not so special..
1
When I arrived here I was offered water which I happily accepted to wet my whistle. When I received the bill it became apparent that the water wasn't complimentary but was extravagant still water from Fiji which set me back 15 dollars for a 1 litre bottle. Don't go to this establishment it is a snooty overpriced tourist trap and I was robbed. Would you pay $15 for a litre of water
3
Not a great location off the lobby of the Mandarin Hotel. Just didn't feel very special and felt more like an old tired hotel steakhouse. The floor plan is a bit odd as well with the bar (nobody there and dead) in a separate area of the restaurant. Steak did not taste like it does in the US despite them saying they ship all USDA meat in. Service was alright but there was really nobody in the restaurant
3
Dinner in hotel location. Nice ambience. Spinach salad & crab cakes good. Salmon poor & improperly grilled on just one side. Sirloin steak poor-thin cut-25%fat throw away. Served on a sizzling plate--so medium rare turned out to be quickly well done on the bottom. Had an expensive bottle of Napa Cab--unfortunately no good food to go with it. Head waiter was very sympathetic & took the Steak & salmon off our check
5
My husband a I had a excellent meal from a' la cart menu. Both our starters and steaks cooked just beautifully. We found that they serve large portions so one main meal would have been big enough to share with the sides. Staff really friendly and helpful
4
My family loves steaks and it dawned on us that we should give Ruth's Chris Steak a try. The service level was commendable, and the ambience was welcoming and cordial. We were satisfied with the salad, crab cakes, and barbecued shrimps. The star dishes i.e. the steaks (filet and ribeye) did not disappoint as well. Serving the steaks on buttery hot plates was a clever touch, as the rich flavours and aromas were greatly enhanced.But the desserts were a let down. The chocolate molten cake and creme brûlée were just so forgettable!
3
The staff were attentive, the ambience is great and food portions are generous. However, the reason I rate it 3/5 is because the food was just average for the price you pay. We went as a group of four and the total dinner price was 800+ SGD. The ribeye steak was large but because of its thickness, it was also cooked unevenly. If you do go to ruth's, I recommend you just go for the petite filet and then desserts. In my personal opinion, their desserts are much better than their mains. Their mains are pretty average

On a short trip to Singapore I find myself alone on a Sunday night before my Monday client meetings. I'm staying at the marina mandarin, so why not have a steak in the in house Ruths Chris. I have been a fan of this chain for years.. And have been to my local Hong Kong one many times. It's always good.. But never GREAT. But you know what you're going to get. Good steak, good steak and price range that's not extortionate. And so it was.. A classic and standard operating procedure carried out. Service was perfect. One niggling point I always had in the hk branch was the wine list. There was never any casual wine by glass that wasn't totally mis priced. So it was a pleasant surprise to find the Singapore branch to be different with a nice list of sgd25 per glass red wine. I had a no fuss meal. Petite filet. Broccoli. One glass of red wine. Perfect. Highly recommended
5
had lunch with a friend the other day. decided to check out the restaurant. was not disappointed. service staff are top notch. menu is pretty impressive. i loved the plating and portion of the dishes.. small, delightful and totally yummy. lovely place to come and have a nice meal. reckon it's on the high end but once in a blue moon, it's worth every penny. compliments to the chef !
5
We decided to go for a steak and Ruth's chris steak house certainly did not disappoint. The food and service was impeccable from start to finish. This restaurant is by no means cheap but it is definitely worth a visit.
5
my wife and I had 2 meals in this restaurant on our visit to Singapore for a great steak try the cowboy rib eye meals are not cheap but you get what you payed for wine list is also good
5
We came here for our wedding anniversary and we're very impressed. While very expensive, the food was amazing (especially the lamb chops) and the staff really friendly. They went above and beyond and brought out a delicious cake as a gift for our celebration.
5
This was my first trip to a Ruth's Chris Steak House and I was very impressed with the quality of the food. I was being entertained at a business dinner so can not comment on the final bill but all other aspects, i.e. food, service, ambience were excellent
5
Hubby booked this restaurant for my birthday few days ago. We loved the restaurant setting, very cozy and romantic for celebration. We ordered quite a feast, lobsters bisque, crab cakes, prawn, Steak and cheese cake. The food was awesome, we loved it but we couldn't finish the steak because we ordered a huge serving. The waiter that serve us was very attentive and we have a complimentary cake from them because of my birthday and they also took a picture for us as souvenir. The food was expensive but with quality. Crab cakes and prawn was very tasty, Steak was cooked according to our requirements. We will go back again
3
Had the Petit Filet with shrimps and it was pretty good. Pricey, but I'm still undecided if the food was worth it. I love the setting of the restaurant. It was very intimate and great for anniversaries or a nice romantic date. Service-wise... Well the hostess chose to completely ignore me and pretended I wasn't right there. It's pretty obvious when you're the one talking and her replies were towards the one who wasn't. Maybe she was having a "speak to men only day" or I must have stepped on her foot in the train before, I don't know. Luckily, the server was very professional and hospitable. We were treated very well throughout dinner, and I like that he came out with all the desserts to present them to us instead of just throwing us a menu. He was also nice enough to offer to take a photo of us and print it out in a nice little card. Overall, I wouldn't mind having dinner there again.

We are regulars at Ruth's Chris in the US, expecting the quality and service of this chain. The steaks were excellent, however unfortunately this place in Singapore is totally outrageously overpriced. Our bill was over 700 Sin $, for four guests. The manger was very nice and professional, however his staff is not properly trained. Our waiter could not pour one single glass of wine without spilling. The table cloth looked like the beef was slaughtered on the table. He then admitted that he had just started to work at RC. When I used some gift cards, which I got in the US, it took a long time to get them processed, and on top the restaurant decided unilaterally to give me an exchange rate well below the official rate, resulting in an overcharge of US$94. We know Singapore is expensive, but this was just a rip-off. I will never go there again, and under no circumstances recommend anyone else to do so

We went for business dinner at Ruth Chris as our overseas visitor wanted to enjoy a good steak. This place was recommended by a friend so we went there. Fatal mistake. The service was very mediocre and the steak – less said the better.Initially, we waited at the bar area and ordered wine by the glass. The bottle must have been opened last year! It got changed after our guest pointedly asked questions about it. We didn’t take any more chances and switched to ordering wine by the bottle for dinner.At dinner, the bread served was white bread so one of our guests requested for a more whole meal or brown bread. The response was that they could serve us “peanut butter” to make the bread brown. We couldn’t figure out if this was meant to be a joke (it was in bad taste) and it started the dinner on a wrong note. Two of us asked for the steak to be done between medium and well done (more on the well done side). The person taking the order checked twice before confirming it. The steak came in on the rare side. It was also quite buttery! When we pointed out that the steak wasn’t cooked the way it was ordered, the service attendant assured us that they will fix it. The solution was to throw more butter on the steak and heat it up even more so that the outside was burnt brown and nothing happened to the inside. There was now more butter in the dish with burnt pieces floating in it. It was singularly unappetizing (see photo).The steak was a disgrace to a steakhouse of repute. It was a very embarrassing dinner with business guests in attendance. The only reason I have give 2 stars was that the other two orders served were reasonably decent

Just like anywhere else. Singapore's Ruth's Chris steakhouse is no exception. As good as it is in the states. Superb steaks imported from the US. great crabmeat. highly recommend mushroom stuffed with crabmeat and any steak on the menu. Service was excellent as well. Great experienc

Our visit to the restaurant was a gift to ourselves for a great job at the ADEX 2016. Service and ambiance was superb - food was prepared meticulously, steak was cooked 100% correctly. Definitely fine dining, still water was $15 sgd and glasses of wine started at $2

I was really impressed with the service I had tonight and the food was what I expected of a high end steak house.
Great for a special occasion or a business meeting. I would recommend and return.

Perfect steak house in Singapore; very yummy and cozy steak house Resto. With good view and ambience. Fast and friendly staff, variety of food was perfect; and the steak soooooo yummy and tasted

Food portions are massive, we enjoyed our steaks. Couldn't eat all our sides. The chairs are really wide so they were very uncomfortable. You have to lean forward the whole time as if you sit back in your chair you are too far from the table.The food prices are ridiculous. I know Singapore is expensive but seriously this is a joke. We ordered 2 steaks and 3 sides and 4 drinks and the cost was almost SGD400
5
Nice dinner here with great steaks just as expected in the US, tender juicy and of course served in butter, good for business dinners but very expensive if you are doing this on your own!! Recommend the rib eye and fries, lads and soups are also goo

Went here last Saturday for the second time . the fillet steak was excellent as was the service. However I do have to question the price. I have eaten just aswell many times for less than half the amount. £50 for an 11 ounce steak ridiculous
5
I always go to Ruth Chris for steak and it never fails to disappoint me ! I really enjoy the steak here and the service is fantastic ! The steak is sizzling hot when served and their desserts are really delicious and one portion is so big, 2 people can share

My husband and I love a good steak cooked perfectly to how we like it to be done. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse definitely meet the mark. We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and I casually mentioned it during reservations and they surprised us with a birthday cake for my husband and took a photo for us and printed it inserted into a card as a gift for us.Great attention to details. Service staff were attentive yet not intrusive.The 11oz filet was too big a serving for me. Both my filet and my husband's ribeye were cooked perfectly rare, so tender and well seasoned. According to their website, all steaks are USDA Prime served sizzling on a 500° plate - every bite is as delicious as the first. The last bite definitely taste as good as the first.The sizzlin blue crab cake is something different filled with lots of crab chunks served on a heated plate.Our meal felt a bit too rich with butter in the heated bread, crab cake and steak.Our meal cost us about S$248. Definitely recommend for a special occasion

Good steak but if you’re a hotel guest (as I confirmed to my waiter twice before seating and once on arrival) you must confirm that you can room charge your meal. In my case even right after asking for my bill and again signing to my room I was suddenly told that I couldn’t charge to my room.After speaking to the restaurant manager who would only say that they had spoken to the hotel duty manager and informed that "some guests cannot make room charges." This is where it gets interesting and as I wasn't satisfied with his answer, I approached the hotel duty manager who was in reception who explained that he had had no contact at all with the restaurant, nor had any of his reception staff who then called the restaurant who when challenged couldn’t even recall who they spoke to 5 minutes earlier and yes room charges can of course be made by hotel guests.Good food, terrible service; take your credit card and expect the worse

This restaurant was super hard to find. It's located inside a hotel up on the 3rd floor. When I called to make reservations and get directions, the person on the phone did not tell me this, thus, took us about an hour to finally find the restaurant. And carrying around a 9 month old baby while trying to find this restaurant wasn't too fun. At any rate, after we finally found it and settled in, we had a good experience and enjoyed the famous steaks that Ruth's Chris is known for.
5
I dined here with some work colleagues for dinner. We each had steak and a selection of side dishes as well as a couple of bottles of wine. The staff were extremely attentive and friendly. The streak was very good and an excellent selection of wine. All-in-all a great night out.
2
Very few diners, therefor, the ambience was not welcoming. The steaks were excellent but were astronomically expensive. I would expect to dine for a whole long weekend for this amount.

Lovely & Cosy place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Attentive service and awesome steak cooked to my kinda perfection.
Will go back to celebrate my spouse's birthday.
Must try their crab cake :)

We booked through the concierge at our hotel, and were told we may not be allowed in without a jacket and tie (very wrong, atmosphere was extremely casual). We had not been to a Ruth's Chris before, so didn't know what to expect. I am glad we didn't dress up. The service was good, but way over the top. Our waiter played everything up way too much. He gave the same cheesy lines to every couple he approached, and at one point was making us quite uncomfortable, inappropriately flirting with me in front of my husband. The food was good, but not amazing. We live in Alberta, Canada so we are blessed to have some of the best beef in the world. Maybe my tastes have been spoiled. My steak (filet) was nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth what we were charged. The bill came out to over $500 Singapore dollars (equivalent to $500Cdn) for two people to have steak, shared potato gratin, shared asparagus that was woody, a glass of wine and dessert each. I was absolutely astounded... and not in a good way. We asked the waiter if the service charge of 10% on the bill was a gratuity, and he LIED and said no, it was a tax, so we tipped an extra 15%. He lied right to our face... We will not return to a Ruth's Chris, anywhere, ever... It is so extremely overpriced it is insulting. I can get a better meal at the local pub in our little town for one fifth the price. I can go to a beautifully decorated haut cuisine restaurant and get a five course meal for that much money, heck... I could feed a small nation for a month for that much money. We took our entire family (6 adults and two children) to the Longview Steakhouse in Alberta, (rated in the top 10 steakhouses worldwide) it cost us less, and the service was better. Sorry if I missed the point of this restaurant somewhere along the way, it is highway robbery. If you haven't been, rest assured, you aren't missing out on anything special

Tried all the different steak houses and still like Ruth's Chris best. Just get the ribeye 16oz, the 12oz is less marbled and less juicy. The porterhouse is not as good as the ribeye despite the price tag. The blue crab cake is good, the asparagus too. I love the sour dough bread and cream. The Au Gratin is very nice too. The dessert is good, cheese cake and crÃ¨me bulee. The steak in Singapore costs more than the ones in US. In US, my bill in Ruth's Chris is 70% of Singapore's after conversion

I first went to Ruths Chris in New Orleans for my 12th birthday thanks to a wonderful lady named Dot Domilese. Mrs Fertel was still very active in the running of the restaurant. Tonight was a very nice reaffirmation that the tradition of great service and great food is continuing even here on the other side of the world. The bone in ribeye (for me) and the salmon for my wife were cooked and served to perfection. The NOLA decor was a nice touch as well. Our server, Jose and the manager Faizel are top notch and added to the experience. If you're in Singapore and want a true American steak experience, this is the place.
5
WOW - the best steak we've had. I had the Petit fillet and my husband had the Ribeye. Cooked to perfection and so tender. We shared two sides - Wedges and Asparagus - This was the perfect amount (any more would have been a waste). Bernard was a delightful waiter. Service A1. We will certainly be returnin
5
We enjoyed a meal at Ruth's Chris steak house. 4 of us plus a baby. The shrimp starter was fantastic, the prawns were plump and the sauce tasty. We ordered 2 12oz rib eye, 12oz New York strip and a petit fillet. The steaks were all juicy and cooked perfectly. We ordered 4 sides to share (broccoli, mushrooms, fries and wedges) at approx $20 a side these were pretty pricey. We were celebrating a birthday and given a complimentary birthday cheese cake and a photo of the family around the table. This was a nice touch and a great demonstration of the service quality. All the staff were very professional and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely go back.

Me and my wife went there on our first wedding anniversary. Nice place to go eat with friendly staff. The place is pretty big and spacious, maybe a little bit too big when you see how many guests were there but then again it could be because of their upper price class. We had a huge steak for around S$300 + 7% taxes and 10% service charge. The steak was as ordered and tasted really good. I think the sides should be a little bit more for this amount but the steak was perfect and tasted amazing. The staff were really friendly but couldn't eat because someone always came by to check if everything was ok. Maybe it was just bad timing but when you are eating and got your mouth full , it's hard to answer your questions and if everything is fine the first time... why check every 3 - 5 minutes?Overall I really enjoyed this place, where you can have a nice steak, it's not crouded and you can enjoy your dinner and conversation without having to raise your voice to be understood. We also received a small cake for our Anniversary, really great gesture from the restaurant. Normally I would have given 4 1/2 stars but only to minor things: because the place is to big and the disturbance while eating....but at least you get service here... not used to that in Singapore
4
We fancied some steak and picked this place on a whim - it had some encouraging views on the web. We got there, were warmly welcomed with a very nice table by the window, and chose our food. The fillet steaks were delicious, the sides HUGE, and we had a great recommendation for the wine. Service was attentive (this is not common in Singapore) and prompt. Overall a lovely evening! I would recommend this place......but I was left with the nagging feeling it was all a little bit dull....I recognise this is me being a little bit fussy
4
I ate here last week and no doubt, the food, wine and service was very very good. Porterhouse steak was cooked to perfection with a lot of flavor.Good wine selection and very attentive service..The restaurant was very quiet (think there were only 3 other tables in use) which meant that it was lacking a bit of atmosphere. The outside area is great for a night view of the Marina Bay Sands and surrounding skyline
4
Ruth's Chris did not disappoint, The service and steaks were excellent. The price is on the high side but worth it.
The restaurant is located at the Marina Manderin Hotel

Wanted to have a good steak for lunch and Ruth Chris was one of the few steakhouses open for lunch. We had the crab stuffed mushrooms for starters, which were excellent. The steaks were all cooked perfectly. The sides of fries and asparagus were OK. One small complaint was that the plates used to serve the food were quite basic and utilitarian; for the price, i would have expected more.The service was great; very friendly staff who were not too intrusive but always there whenever you needed something.All in all a very enjoyable mea
5
Great service, friendly welcome, amazing steaks cooked to perfection, the whole evening was a delight, it's the perfect place to have a genuine American steak, Cooked the way it should be, black crust, rare in the middle for me. But they will cook it any way you want. I will come back here and go to the one in HK.
4
Amazing place , and the steak was awesome . Had the lamb chops as well which was par excellence Instead of the usual potato deiced to have brussel sprouts and baked tomato ... The tomato exceeded expectations . As for dessert there is a small choice but we had the bread pudding and was it reminiscent of years gone by .. truly authentic taste . The service was exemplary being very attentive yet unobtrusive ...somewhat a rarity these days ..
4
We came here for lunch today and tried the wagyu burger, which came with chips and a coffee. Price seemed reasonably at below $40 all in per person. We were the only people in the restaurant at lunchtime - I can only assume it's busier in the evening. Service was friendly and efficient

It was a good thing Morton's next door at Pan Pac was full, so my assistant recommended I have my business dinner at Ruth's Chris. Strange name but apparently a large restaurant chain in the US - Morton's competitor - that started out in New Orleans. So the offerings are quite American, with (very) large cuts of meat, salad wedges and the like.I didn't expect much, but was delighted by how good the steak was. I ordered the Petite Fillet - all others were just too big - which was an 8 oz steak, medium. It was tasty and juicy, and very tender. The way it was prepared with salt, pepper and who knows what else gave it a unique taste. The best I have had in a very long time, possibly ever.We ordered an American Merlot from Napa Valley, which was exquisite and a perfect match for our steaks. The desserts were huge, too, but we split a delicious chocolate cake, aptly called "The Chocolate Sin Cake". The service was pretty good, though it sometimes was hard to catch the eye of the waiters zipping by.It was pricey, but worth it
4
My family went to Ruth Chris during its 1st week or 2 of opening. Perhaps the staff was not well trained and the machinery was well oiled yet. The ribeye was fairly dry and the buttery plate was too greasy. You left the place feeling you had eaten chunks of fats and oils. We plucked up courage to go there again for our anniversary. This time was a surprising change. Staff were friendly and helpful. Service was prompt. The appetizer bbq shrimps and crab cakes were heavenly. The crab cake was rich with crab meat. We ordered fillet this time round as we heard that their fillet taste better than their ribeye. It did not disappoint. The meat was done just the way we wanted it. Soft, tender yet retaining its juice and beefiness. The molten chocolate cake was not bad but try their banana cream pie - it was simply delicious with a nice crisp a the top. Staff kindly gave us a chocolate cake for our anniversary and presented us with a nice family photoshot as momento. I used to think Morton's is the best but now Ruth Chris is not any worse in terms of food taste

Being from the United States it is difficult to get a steak in Asia. They mean well – just it does NOT taste like the steaks in the US. I found out that 99 percent of the steaks come from Australia… When I say 99 percent is because I found Ruth’s Chris is here in Singapore!!!When my steak came out on its hotplate drizzled in butter it made me feel like I was home again. When I smelled it – I almost cried – it was a real USDA Prime steak!! Be careful as the steaks with bones in them – the Porterhouse, the “Bone in Ribeye” are from Australia… (Just say no… get the USDA Prime)After my dinner, my body and mind were renewed – I felt like a million dollars – this is the place when you need a steak. Ruth’s Chris menu has stayed mostly the same – you order a huge potato for two, the salad has come down in size – just everything is wonderful. The asparagus comes with hollandaise or just plain and that is about it… This is not a fancy dress up sauce with grilled vegetables or a turnip mousse or any fusion at all – it is a “the place” to get a REAL steak… Order the Filet – both the petite and larger ones are great. It is worth every penny as it is not available (in this way – sizzling plate and USDA Prime) anywhere else. This is just between you and me – because when it comes to steak – it is serious business – or just don’t do it… Order the filet – and keep it quiet – I really choose to have my steak available when I come to visit… Say hello to John Porte and tell him Steven sent you!This is the only place we will have a a steak in Singapore - they are open for both lunch and dinner and they are always excellent..

Went for dinner with my wife and a couple of friends on the recommendation of our concierge 'Kennith' at Pan Pacific and I had one of the best bone in rib eye steaks (620 grams) I have ever had, sure the price was on the high side but when you enjoy a meal the price doesn't really matter all that much, my wife had a spectacular looking prawn dish which she thoroughly enjoyed. The service was exceptional, the manager came over to check that everything was in order and at the end of the evening he sent us complimentary desert wine which was a appreciated touch
5
This is my second visit to this restaurant and I'm afraid to say I ate there three nights in a row. After the first night steak I tried the stuffed chicken breast and was hooked. Portions are big but as several people have mentioned, it's a bit expensive. However the ambience is nice and the staff were fantastic. All were good but Bernard, Wilfred and the GM Mr. Subra (who offered me a dessert that I simply couldn't fit in, thanks anyway) were excellent. I will be going back. Special kudos for Mr. Subra for his efforts in dealing with an somewhat inebriated guest who wanted to argue that his 16 oz steak was not 16 oz. After he had eaten it. Well done
5
Should try this place... Should br a little expensive, but you will get satisfaction if you're a steak lover
Tried the more-or-less 600gr wagyu australian coboy steak, and the steak was so tender
They cooked it briliantly
Should try this place
3
A classical Ruth's Chris experience. No surprises but no disappointments either - despite the bill. 600 S$ for two steaks, side order, one dessert and a bottle of Cabernet from Napa - it's too much!
5
Excellent service, wine and food. We had a mixture of steaks and seafood and all was great! Disappointed that they didn't have any Sam Adams in stock.
4
Had one of my best tenderloins there, ever. Excellent and attentive service, cozy atmosphere. They also serve the typical american heavy cheesecake for desert (if one likes it).
Overall a hefty bill but probably worth for the meat you get.
5
we were greeted by polite,warm staff. fantastic service, always ready to serve us. food is fine and big portion.i have to mention that the manager (mr faidzal) really did a great job in serving and making all patron, not only us, feel comfortable and making our experience dining there a lovely one
3
The steaks were great, brilliantly done. Ordered a US sirloin to share, Caesar salad, and fries, with a prawn cocktail to start. Finished in 60 minutes. The waiter took away our plates, with left over fries, while my wife still had the last bite in her mouth. He didn't even blink. For $300 I expect more. Won't return.
3
Good steaks, friendly service (server brought us the wrong table's sides and drinks), as expected from a major steak chain. However, with this kind of price tag, you can find lots of other options in the city! With this price you would expect great service but the server made a couple of mistakes and seemed to be in a rush. Further more, they seated us next to a couple with a child (i have children so i have nothing against them) who was bouncing on the chairs, going between the table and wall etc The staff could have at least seated us (husband and I ) away from the toddler table, to enjoy the meal and ambience of Ruth Chris. If someone is looking for a good steak in Singapore, Ruth Chris will not be one of them
5
I was very very happy when my sister told me she's going to take me here for dinner. So I had a REALLY high expectation for them (poor them) but I ended up having a really pleasant time here.Our waiter was very friendly, I was satisfied with my steak (not a BIG steak enthusiast but still a foodie) but I was more intrigued by other dishes. I found the crab cake out of this world! If I can go to Singapore again and only have 1 meal to feed me throughout my trip it would be their crab cake. DEFINITELY a must try.The sides are amazing too, I recommend the Potatoes Lyonnaise if you're a fan of onions.And the dessert... the cheesecake was also impeccable (again, recommended)The ambience of the restaurant is pretty good too.So again, was definitely happy, and definitely planning to go again
5
This is my favorite restaurant to dine steak!! We have been to Ruth Chris's in US, & Hongkong, and we are always satisfied with the food and service. The one in Singapore is also the same!!Steak is a little bit expensive, but it is worth it!!
5
Liked everything........disliked nothing. Yes it was pricey, very pricey but the quality was on a different planet. Simply the finest fillet steak I have ever eaten, everything else I ate was also wonderful but the steak was mind-blowing!To top this all the staff are great, friendly but not pompass, attentive but not over the top. I am now a huge fan and when I return to Singapore I WILL be eating here again :-)Forget the cost....you only live once so treat yourself to this place for a special occasion
4
It was not really marvelous, but the rib eye was good enough to rate a 4-star rating for me. Service was good and attentive too. Overall a pleasant experience...
5
I've been there twice now, once with the family and last week on business. While the food really is nearly perfect in every way, a glass of red wine was 40 dollars which is hard to swallow. A great place is someone else is paying!
5
We went for a business dinner in a large group with 17 people. Food was excellent and service very good. As everything in Singapore is expensive, this too was no exception, but food was worth it.
5
Have been there in Hawaii during honeymoon, unforgettable, so I made several visit during my stay in Singapore. Prime Ribeye Strongly recommended. Thick, Juicy Steak on Hot plate(with butter). You could not resist against the sizzling sound of it! Wine not so good.
5
My wife loves good steaks. And that creates a constant challenge for me - to search out the best steaks everywhere we go - both when we're home in Singapore or when traveling overseas. And the fact that she associates hearty steak dinners with romantic rendezvous, the stakes were even higher for me.So that makes me doubly glad when she gave her lip-smacking approval for the wonderful meal we had for her birthday at Ruth's Chris Steak House. And while we certainly enjoyed the regular Morton's, I must say that Ruth's Chris is in a distinct league of its own. We started out with two awesome appetizers - cajun crab cakes and BBQ prawns done New Orleans style. The freshness of the crab and the amazingly smooth buttery white wine sauce, garlic, and spices with the perfectly grilled prawns were simply amazing. While I normally take every recommendation by professional food bloggers with a pinch of salt (since they're either paid or given free food tastings in exchange for par excellent reviews), I must say their recommendations of the crab cake and BBQ prawns were truly spot on. But hey, let's not get distracted by the appetizers. Since this is a steakhouse, the real benchmark here should still be the steak eh? And we were surely not disappointed. In fact, the signature ribeye was so delightful that my wife still hasn't stopped talking about it. Charred to a divine perfection, the USDA ribeye steak was so well-marbled that every bite oozed with such juicy-ness and flavor. The taste of the meat itself is perfect without too much marination fanfare - we were happy to just settle for generous dashes of salt and pepper and some herbs that we couldn't make out. And thankfully, we ordered only the 340g portion for S$85 each. I was earlier tempted to get the bigger portion for S$110 and was glad I didn't. The 340 was big enough - anything more and it would have been an overkill, no matter how yummy the steak is. Overall, I think Ruth's Chris has truly lived up to its reputation of being a fine steak house. It's so memorable an experience that we're likely to go back again
3
There wasn't anything horrible, it was just that this Ruth's Chris isn't a patch on the restaurants in the States. Also, I really dislike that they heat the plates to a ridiculous temperature (sizzling like mad) and serve the steaks covered in melted butter, bizarre.It was also pretty pricey (Sing $800 for 3 people but that did include 2 bottles of Muga Rioja) and the place was almost deserted (2130hrs on a Thursday night!
1
Looking at all the good reviews, I must have been terribly unlucky. Went there for my husband's birthday - both our steaks were supposed to be medium rare; his came out cold in the middle and mine was overdone. We are usually very accepting of average food and service, but what was appalling is that this is supposed to be a steak house, they charge close to $100 for a piece of steak and yet, they can't get it right. What's worse is that when we sent back my husband's steak (I didn't send back mine cos I was too hungry!), the waiter and manager weren't in the least apologetic. They just sent it back and came back with the 'warmed up' steak, which wasn't perfect but fairly acceptable. As it was a special occasion, we didn't make a fuss. To make matters worse, we ordered a molten chocolate cake, and guess what .... not molten in the middle!! Not sure what kind of chefs they are hiring here but they clearly aren't spending their customers' money on good chefs!Please don't go even if you have money to spend
4
Make it a special occasion for Ruth's - great quality food and beverages but the bill will shock some. The decor is oddly eighties but comfortable - try the scallops for starter and choose any steak from the very long list. Other mains are available if you don't want beef, but why come here if not for a big juicy steak?
5
Hello all, for those who follow my crazy travel schedule you will know I travel 250 days a year. Just had the best steak in Singapore ever. The meal was fantastic, eclectic wine list, rib eye steak and asparagus that makes you want to be a vegetarian. The service was simply peerless. Because of my travels, I like a bit of solitude for a meal so sat in the bar. What a treat. Halim the bartender is a true professional and had a delightful chat. The assistant manager Faidzal came by and normally I find that intrusive but this bloke was a delight to chat with and felt that ,even thought he restaurant was busy, was his most important guest. Effortless efficiency and charisma. The staff are perfect, the meal was quick.. You will NOT be disappointed. Say hi to Faidsal and Halim for me...Cheers R
3
Very Attentive and Good Service. The Waiter took time to explain the menu and patiently took the orders from our table. The Steak was a little disappointing and even though it was Tender and Juicy, perfectly done to medium rare, the Meat lacked flavour. Have had better Steaks elsewhere. For the price paid, would prefer to dine elsewhere
4
The steak was very good but the $120 per person for the set menu was expensive when they added tax, service charge and $15 for a bottle of water, $16 for a small Tiger beer.
5
The first stop of our itinerary on our first day in Singapore was to visit Ruth Chris Steakhouse! We met with my friend who was living in Singapore at that time. We recommended a lot of things that we ended up ordering more than half of what was on the menu. Steak was done to perfection, and still pink inside. Staff were very friendly and accommodating as well. Main course is ordered separately from the side dish. As you can see from our pictures, we ordered so many appetizers and it was so good... problem is, we couldnt control ourselves from taking more pictures of the other food because we couldnt wait to sink our teeth in the meat! Price is very expensive, but it was worth it for my family
5
First visited Ruth's Chris in LA Anaheim. Love the steak so much that I went back for 3 nights. The meat is juicy, tender, generous and perfect! It is almost the same for the one in Singapore but a lot pricier. Almost 4 times more! The ambience is good, the service is excellent! Will definitely visit the place again. The mouth watering steak without having to fly to LA is worth penny though
4
Had a quick dinner when staying at the Marina Mandarin and quite enjoyed it. We both stayed away from the steaks and had seafood and chicken which was excellent. Wine by the glass was good and the service also better polished than Hong Kong, Ended up being expensive as always but was pretty good overall
4
Repeated customer of Ruth's Chris around the world we had a dinner here. The restaurant is not easy to find as it is in an hotel.Traditional Ruth's Chris menu and setting. Very good food even if not as good as in the States, very nice service and staff.The only problem is the price as you have to consider to pay twice the price of the same food in USA.Nice but expensive experience
3
The traditionally serve their steaks in a sizzling dish...which still isnt my prefered way. Good location. Nicely laid out restaurant. Very attentive staff. They really need to sort out the airconditioning there. It is simply too cold.! It is not cheap either. A coule of drinks at the bar. 2 steaks...few trimmings ...1 bottle of wine and you'll be topping S$500 .
2
You know that feeling ... The one that says I fancy a steak ... Then you realise that you are in one of the food capitals of the world (Singapore) ... But the feeling still persists so you run to the familiar , in this case Ruth's steakhouseI ordered the bare essentials (fillet, spinach etc) but was disappointed with both. The wine choice by the glass was limited . The service was stammering and disjointed but pleasant and polite The experience was altogether lacking that special something that you might expect at this price
4
WELL DONE! Great steaks prepared just the way you want, yummy lobster bisque, fab crab cakes, heavenly cheese cake and the bread is to die for!What more could you ask for ....great service .... and that too!Thank you to the staff, keep up thegreat job
4
I tried Ruth's Chris Steak House in the States and it was one of the best steaks I had ever eaten. Naturally, I was quite excited when they opened in Singapore. The steaks here do not disappoint and were excellent as well. The recommended crab cakes were also very good. Service standard was very high with attentive staff
5
Shared a business meal with a consultant. Food was excellent (a bit pricey but it is Singapore). Service was very good, staff were attentive, well informed and our orders were done to perfection (i.e. "charred on the outside and pink inside"). Portions can be very large, even the sides are easily shareable. A very nice meal. We both noted that the service was very fast, we'd hardly finished our first drink when the meal was served

Impressed with its freshly baked bread and butter before the appetisers and mains. Crab cakes as recommended were delicious although we were glad we shared as one per person might have been indulgent and rich. The portobello mushroom platter suited the group with its combination of potato and tomatoes. Cleaned off my medium done petit fillet (as did my friends with theirs including a few who chose the ribeye). Our group of 8 shared 4 desserts (each was shockingly in the range of $25 but served in a sizeable portion) - a small slice of their Chocolate sin cake was served complimentary for the birthday boy - a must for choc lovers as it was darkly rich with just the right amount of sweetness. If not for the price tag of $9 per coffee, we would have completed our dinner with it. Great service by the staff including recommendations

We were in Singapore and looking for a good steak house, and our concierce proposed this resturant. The service was good and the steak was perfect. The side orders were a bit small, but that leaves room for dessert as well. The price tho was a bit to high for such a meal and i was suprised to see how expensive it was when we got the check. But for a good steak, this is one of the place to go to

Had a lunch with 2 guests on Sunday... however my filet(wanted it medium) turned out to be so overly well done, that it was more greyish brown than any ounce of pink. when the server came to do his customary service check, did not know how to do any service recovery on my badly turned out steak, when all he could say was: "I am sorry, I think becos you asked for your steak to be charred, they overcooked it." that's it, no offer of a replacement or anything. onion rings were on the slightly soggy side and water glasses were even toped up throughout the meal. We have to ask for water by gesturing our glasses in the air(and the restaurant was probably 20 to 30 percent full!) To be fair, we were in a rush for our food, however, it seemed that our steaks and onion rings were cooked much earlier in the hope of "helping" us with our tight schedule. But should it even be this manner of food planning? It was such an expensive meal that had no service standard and food quality to match it. I kept wondering how does such a upscale steakhouse I experienced in NYC, bore totally no resemblance at all in Sg. Sig

We were starving to have steak and decided to dine at RCSH. Warm welcome by a charming lady :-), and comes John who was attending us. We all had Ribeye, while mine was well done, mouth watering and love it. We also had fries which was perfect & crisp, sautéed potato with onion which was good and the best was the mushroom filled with crab meat.By end of the meal, I could not move, food was so good that I did not realise I ate more than I could :-

Initially great service, got a nice table. The waiter quickly talked tome about My order in a pleasent way. Ordered quickly crab in mushrooms and a rib eye steak. The mushrooms and crab was nice and a generous portion. Then Cameron the ribeye no. a to small plate. In addition i had ordered steak Fries which were totally uneatable. IT could have been a nice memory but the arrogance on the chips just took the magic our of it. Will not return

There's nothing bad to say about this place if only our welcoming was a little cold.. I guess our casual dressing code and late arrival without booking (the place was not full) had something to do with this.After we got seats, the waiter was very friendly and open to small talk, the manager went to check on us 2 times.The selection of wine is extensive and pricey but it's to be expected in a place with such good food and service.We didn't have that big of an appetite, but we ordered a starter meal each and steaks with side dishes as the main course... Big mistake. I finished it all but not my girlfriend.As for the quality of the food, it was impeccable. The cooking, the size, the flavors, the ingredients... It had it all. Their chocolate Lava Cake is truly something and probably one of the best in Singapore but I can't confirm.The setting of the place was very classy but modern, spacious and quiet, but a little too much air conditioned if you do not get there warmly dressed enough. I'd say go there with long sleeves or long dress.If you're looking for a special dining experience with your wife or a business dinner (like some table beside us)... You won't be disappointed. As my title says it's an awesome experience that only a few Michelin rated tables in France can top... So expect a steep price but only if you order a good bottle of wine to go with these marvelous steaks

We stopped over in Singapore on our way to China and didn't have a lot of time so opted for a steak.We were recommended to this restaurant and it certainly didn't disappoint.The steaks were cooked exactly as we had ordered and were delicious. The service was good considering how busy it was and the price was fair
5
If you want to get good staff and be prepared to pay the price this is that place.We got excellent chefs recommation shrimps 3 new yorkers 320g and one 620g fillet. Bottle of red vine and some dessert all together around 500€. In my opinion it was worth the money

Decided to come here for lunch after having been to the branches in the US, taiwan etc.Restaurant was empty when we arrived. There was a set lunch where the entrees are in small or regular portions, but pricey. The smallest 6oz tenderloin fillet is $65. Add $20 for a salad or soup or side, choose 1 only. The asparagus and potato gratin sides were average. The steak was very good though. We ordered the chocolate molten cake and it was a monster. Both of us couldn't even finish itGot ready to leave and it was still totally empty. The main reason i surmise would be the extragavant prices they are charging for lunch. Many fine dining restaurants here have $50-75 lunch sets, and with the $140 bill per person here, no wonder they aren't getting crowde

Took a private room here for a business dinner recently, steaks were very good, as you would expect, service great and a good selection of wines from around the world. Restaurant was expensive, our bill was high due to the wine ordered more than anything else. Overall an enjoyable experience, if you like a good steak worth a visit

When you want a superior meal go no further than Ruth's Chris Steak House. Rarely have I ever been disappointed in a meal, or service.

my wife and I had 2 meals on our stay steak was great wine list good service was good on both visits

I've been to a few Ruth's Chris and find the meals here absolutely delicious! The steaks are wonderful and the service excellent. This brand has done a great job to replicate this level of product around the globe. I will of course visit again.

This was definitely the most expensive restaurant I have ever been to... if they had displayed the prices outside I would not even had entered it. Once you sit down and see the menu it is too embarassing to say "sorry, this place is too expensive for me" and leave, so you make the best of it.I had an average steak, with a bowl of soup that probably came out of a can, a sprinkling of salad and an espresso coffee. No wine and no liqueur.The bill was the highest I have ever see for one person. I don't mind spending the money for something that only money can buy, but I could have had the same meal at another steak house just down the road at a fraction of the price.definitely not worth it; never agai

Dined there in early June.. It was fathers day so place was packed.. Even for a European craving steak I find Mortons just too big portion wise and was keen to give this a go.. The shrimp and lobster bisque starts were excellent. Steaks I have an issue with the volcanicly hot plate they are served on to make it sizzle.. The bottom half of my medium rare became well done before I got half way through.. Not sure I like the "sizzling" concept. Wine by glass or bottle very expensive in that it was better value for me to drink three potent but very good cocktails.. All in all not sure I would go back. Its on same level as Bedrock for me, but more formal and of course costly.It isn't Mortons , but then again I leave Mortons feeling I need to go for 24 hour lie down due to portion size. Service excellent , absolutely no complaints there

Dined here in early September. The steaks were good but not exceptional. If u want any side dishes this would be extra. The wine list was good. The food and the wine was exceptionally expensive. There were only two other tables occupied in the restaurant. The service was very attentive. Dissapointing considering the price of the evening, maybe u are paying too much for the name

Was here with a few friends (10 of us). This was everyone's first visit. Steaks were served on a sizzling hot plate, which they made it a point to change whenever you wanted to. The steak is ordered by itself, and sides such as vegetables have to be ordered separately. The food was great, the company was great. The staff performed well too! We had a wonderful night stuffing ourselves with large delicious chunks of meat and lots of wine

Had my first virgin dinner experience here and i was totally blown away at the quality of the food. Tried the crab cake and it was really good. The tuna appetizer was worth every cent too.Ordered the Salmon steak and the Rack Of Lamb for main. The salmon was well cooked with the centre still raw. Rack of Lamb was the winner of the night. I don't know what they used to marinade it but there is not even a hint of stench that is so commonly associated with the meat. Ordered the house cheesecake and the molten chocolate cake for dessert and the winner is....Cheese Cake. Price is on the high side but will come back for special occassion

great steak, but after a while of eating we realized serving on the grill results in the steak continually cooking as you are enjoying it. what started as medium might very well end as well done. still good if you don't mind that. had a cocktail myself & wine for my girlfriend, both were at best okay. make sure you get the seats with a view! rest of the tables are spread across the floor, and with the grill at each table, can make areas cluttered

Had a very pleasant meal here and enjoyed the food - crab cakes and steak. Could not fault the food and not surprised by the prices - we knew they would be high. I guess the shock was the price of wine which seemed outrageous and so we stuck to cocktails - they are cheaper than a glass of wine!!
