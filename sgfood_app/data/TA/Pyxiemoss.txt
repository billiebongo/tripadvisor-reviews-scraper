Ordered the 5-course dinner for two. Great presentation, very tasty and service is up to standard. The only things is that the waiting time between each dish is a little bit long.
5
Outstanding flavourful food at economical prices, and a couple of interesting cocktails. Service and drinks were slow, even on a quiet night, but the food more than made up for that. Will definitely return again.

We had the promotional 5-course meal. Right from starter to dessert, it was delighting. Creative play of flavour, texture and use of fresh ingredients. Kudos to the chef!

Went for a promo 5 course dinner and was blown away by how good the food was. Unassuming dishes and worth the price! Strongly recommended for its ambience too! They have good cocktails as well.
5
We went in earlier to an easy Monday dinner. The staff were friendly and the food was really delicious. The tasting menu gives you a sampling of the great dishes at an affordable price.

Went to try pyxiemoss due to the ravings of online reviewers however the snickers 2.0 was quite a disappointment with soggy rice crips and overly dry brownie mochi. Furthermore the cocktails came in glasses with an ice cube that took up 4/5 of the volume.

If you are adventurous try it, I am! I am not sure whether it worked or not but it was certainly different!
FoieGras IceCream Lollipop covered in White Chocolate with Grilled Chicken Skin as a desert. Fortune Favours the Brave!

Service was excellent, staff was friendly with a great sense of humour. I liked the concept of dining at the bar, more relaxed and fun. Great interaction with the bartender who not only know his stuff but knew the food very well too. I liked that they encouraged us to 'play with the food' and I love the bold combination of flavors & textures in the food

Went to PM to celebrate my dad's birthday and left a note on my reservation. We selected the $55 special menu and ordered a bottle of bubbly. They restaurant took pains to remind me of the celebration multiple times, calling and also sending me an email. When we arrived we we quickly shown to our table but had to wait quite a while for menus until we said we were hungry and wanted our pre-booked set meals to start. The place had a cool underground vibe and music was good although way too loud to hear the other people across you at the table. Other patrons seemed to be raising their voices to compete with the music. With each dish, the ingredients were explained to us but service in between meals was very slow. There were no top-up options and since food portions were generally small, we still felt peckish even after ordering a couple more sides. While the chef tried to be quite inventive with each dish, the overall experience was not quite value for money, especially for a family of four. It was a shame that the restaurant also missed providing value - added service by bringing my dad a slice of birthday cake or even wishing him happy birthday. Interesting experience but will have to do more to get us to go back for a second visit.

So we went for the 5-course Chope special tasting menu which i believe was smaller portions of what was offered in the ala carte. The tasting menu can be quite insufficient if you are there on a really empty stomach (even for a lady). The staff did recommend at the beginning that we may like to add on some other dishes. Food was average - none of the dishes was a wow. Felt like the food may work better as bar food instead of being plated as they did in fine dining restaurants. Ambience worked better as a bar too. Service i must say was however great
5
Nice and unpretentious. The staff were absolutely great and the food is good. Perfect for a night out with friends.
5
Excellent service, food and drinks. Highly recommended. Suitable for both small and large groups. Super vegetarian and non vegetarian options
5
I love this place - my second visit and the food was again surprising, different and truly superb. Love the small plates to share. Love the tastes.
3
Dishes lacked flavor and there was too much going on. Some elements on each dish were good but overall a letdown. Need to focus on the basics. Service was good. Atmosphere for a Friday night was a bit dead.
4
What i love most about the place was the ambiance and deco when we enter. Service was prompt and friendly as it wasn't too crowded when we were there last SAT evening. You are still recommended to make reservations especially if you have a big group. Food was a hit and miss. I love some and wasn't impress with some. What i love most would probably be the imberico pork and also the snickers dessert. The chicken crispies and seaviche are not too bad as well. I love the drinks that we had you can always ask them for recommendations. Extremely delighted with the service by Christian. It was personal and also professional. Overall, it is worth a try, but i wouldn't be back for the food, probably just the drinks. We spent about $110/pax for dinner and drinks

First time visit with some friends and not sure what to expect. The answer was: a treat. The food and drinks were very very good and the service was excellent. The starters of beetroot and goats cheese and the crispy chicken were excellent. For "Middle" the Pig, Chicken and Beef dishes were all delicious. It was a little unfortunate that the prawn and tuna dished were not available. Desserts were also interesting but not sure that every aspect of the playful take on traditional favourites all worked but, in the main, they were quite good.We had quite a section of cocktails both on and off the menu and the wine was very good and quite reasonable for Singapore.All in all, a very good evening
5
This is a small establishment consisting of a bar and restaurant, in one of the old shophouses along North Canal Road.Not exactly a fine-dining set up; more of a smart causal kind of place. They serve a modern European cuisine, but it is in no way pretentiousIn fact the food was very good the day my wife and I visited it. It matched in quality and presentation any fine-dining restaurants that we have been to.Service was fast and polite.Order couple of the cocktails and they were good too (even have bespoke ones).Prices were very reasonable; expect around $80 per pax without drinks.Highly recommended and will return.

A nice place tucked away nondescriptly, it has a blink and miss it entrance. That aside, once you go past the door, the place is decorated in a lovely vibe of industrial design. Nice wall, where all the alcohols hang onto a metal frame.Next we are greeting by a very friendly staff who ran through the specials of the day albeit it was barely audible due to the music. We opted for the 55 bucks set and topped up with additional dishes. The food all came, plated really lovingly. And each service staff took the effort to explain what went into the dish. Special mention to the chicken roulade. Very tender. And also the beetroot dish. Magnificent paring with goats cheese. And also the prawn, it had this insane umami taste that you would clear up the head for.The desserts were equally beautiful too. With the deconstructed snickers bar, but was abit let down by the rice puff that was slightly off. Still a very lovely place to check out.

Christian and his team provided 5* service and experience for our group. They went above and beyond and even prepared a couple of things off the menu. They also accommodated a few of our requests (as we had two pregnant people in the party) which was highly appreciated. Great tunes, creative and innovative. 1st rate experienc
5
Service was impeccable - the level of service is what you might expect from a high-end restaurant but nope, you get it from this mid-priced cosy joint. They are warm and very experienced crew.Food was awesome - I would describe it as excellently re-interpreted or deconstructed even. Some might call it hipster but i just call it an excellent night out
5
Tried The Pig and Joshua Prawns for mains and they were both impressive, in their own unique ways. If you don't have time, skip starters and jump straight to mains.
5
Small plates perfect so everyone can eat as little/much as they want and solid, welll-priced wines and drinks. Casual atmosphere that makes you feel like you can stay as long as you want - and great music that doesn't overpower the experience!
5
I absolutely loved this place.
The food was excellent. A couple of things were truly amazing.
I would say a place to go with a few people, as you can try more !!
Definitely be going back ... soon
5
Very creative menu, with thoughtfully and carefully prepared dishes. Everything I tasted (from my plate and the plates of colleagues) was delicious. The manager and waitstaff are attentive and professional. Highly recommended.
4
The Chef does create some pretty interesting dishes, which taste great for the most part; one or two falling short. Will be back, mainly for a light dinner and drinks as the food isn't hearty. It's not a criticism, just managing expectations.
4
Great food and drinks with good value for money. Somewhat hidden location since there's not so much else going on along North Canal Rd. Near to many other great bars as well so this is a perfect place for a date, and then continue on to have a drink at the next bar for example

Went for a quiet mid week meal to catch up with a friend. Off to a great start with a cool ambience, attentive staff and nice vibe about the place. No alarm bells went off when the waiter told us it was the chefs Birthday. So after a nice quiet start with our (delicious) shared entrees the party really started! Except we hadn't been invited. The mains came out just in time before things really cranked up but we ended up having to shout at each other to be heard for the rest of the night. Desserts took forever and we had to ask twice what was going on before they came. Only waited as the blokes were still hungry after the tiny portions of entrees & mains. No matter how good and clever the food is, there's too many other fantastic places in Singapore to eat. Maybe it's like this every night? Unlucky maybe but probably won't risk it again
5
Would definitely recommend this to everyone. Had a lovely evening with friends. The food was quite fantastic. The pork and the onglet were quite exceptional. They serve amazing sliders after 1030pm. Definitely worth the wait. Drinks were awesome as well. Had a really good banana rum house special. Deserts are nice too. Definitely recommend the banoffee. Service was excellent as well. Really good recommendations and staff were friendly and attentive. Special kudos to Christian for the best service I've ever had in Singapore.

Tucked in between some shop-houses, this restaurant has loads to offer. Upon entry , we were greeted by an awesome staff, with smiles all around and seated to our table. we started off with a few cocktails that were exceptional - Ginger Julie & SRWMC!! Geez.. you gotta try this.. followthru by a variety of their specials (as its Xmas!). Fish No Chips (yup you read right), Joshua Prawns, Idberico Pork Collar & then this incredibly juicy turkey roulade! We will def be back here and must call out Christian- whom waited us like a friend (there when you needed

Went there with my husband and was looking forward to it. Restaurant is nice but we did not like the food. Presentation is good but combinations of ingredients disappointed and did not work for most dishes. The cured salmon was lovely but we felt that you needed something more than just salmon. Same with the duck confit served with a fried egg. Small portions and quite pricey as we left still hungry after ordering 7 dishes between us...
4
Great food - unique combinations, strong flavours, and reasonable prices. Would certainly return to try their feature dishes which change weekly. Only drawback was slow service which could have been due to an event in the area.
5
Highly recommended this restaurant. Friendly service and v tasty food. Between four of us we tried all of the dishes on the menu and the specials. Will certainly be back

Must have tasted all 'the speshs' - the specials - in this hidden gem of a restaurant along n. canal road. My second visit for amazing and daring food creations by chef Tim ; the milk belly, pork neck, pumpkin and celeriac dishes were our faves. What is in the sauces please? Pyxiemoss has a handle on molecular cooking it seems. Love the pig's head terrine and duck liver mousse with brown butter and the schmaltz spread is to die for. Cocktail prepared for us to go with the food is innovative and has a twisted elegance with each sip. Charming crew who know their stuff, great service and delightful serving plates sort of completes the picture for a great foodnight out. This restaurant is the one to watch.
5
We were invited by family to have a meal there, based on a recommendation.The service is personable and efficient. It seems everything is done with a twist, so everyone took the time to explain, what was done to food and drink and why.If you are adventurous, I highly recommend letting them select the menu and the accompanying cocktails for you. You won't be disappointed
5
Not usually my mind of thing, but if you're up for a culinary experience (perhaps best described as a remix) instead of culinary retread, then don't think twice. Bonus: my two teens LOVED it, you can be sure they'll be nagging me to return soon. Whatever you do, don't skip the dessert.
5
We have been visiting Pixiemoss regularly since it has opened and each time has been great. The menu, drinks and wine list are carefully selected and presented beautifully. A lot of creativity and thought has gone into the menu, with the specials changing often. We bring our friends from overseas to Pixiemoss and give it two thumbs up. The pork belly dish is my personal favourite and banoffee dessert is worth the extra calories. Love it!!
5
The atmosphere was lovely! It was obvious that the owner put in much thought when setting up the restaurant and creating the menu. We decided to go ahead with three mains even though they kindly recommended with starters, mains and dessert. The owner (I'm assuming) was extremely passionate as he explained the drinks/ food of the day and the story behind the names of the dishes. Food was good, serving wasn't huge (more like fine dining) but we enjoyed every bit of it. My BF was a huge fan of their home-made brandy so give it a go! Overall, romantic and cool place that is worth a visit
5
It is difficult to describe this place. You really have to go and experience it. The food is very unique and delicious! The atmosphere is great. The best I can say about it is what the Restaurant Manager told us: "If you want to come in your black-tie, that's fine. If you want to come i your shorts and flip-flops, that's also fine. We really don't care. What we care about is that we serve you an incredible meal and that you have an awesome time." I guess, that summarizes it the best possible way. We did have an awesome time. Thanks, Pyxiemoss, we will be back

excellent dinner and a culinary discovery journey worth the table of much more expensive restaurants.all the dishes we took were original and creative both in taste and presentation.particular kudos to the dry aged Wagyu that was a special of the day.i am really impressed by the dinner i had for the price paid. menu is a bit short but there is certainly enough to return to for new experience.Team is warmly welcoming. Service OK (if you are served by the mgr, then you get all explanation and details - waiter is much less elaborate). Room a bit noisy, more tuned to bar ambiance than cosy restaurant. Wine list not matching the wonderful dining experience (i am not a cocktail guy, which is one of their selling angle)

Pyxiemoss manages to balance fine dining with good fun, incredible taste sensations yet satisfying food, brilliant presentation without the fuss and finials. The menu is long enough to be interesting and short enough to know that each dish has been freshly and meticulously created. It's the amalgamation of the intricate details that make the experience so good, from the classic children books gracing the tables, to the carefully chosen soundtrack. There are contraptions behind the bar that would look more at home in an operating theatre which add to the slightly irreverent atmosphere and mischievousness of the place. This is a restaurant you can spend an entire evening laughing, helped in no small part by attentive staff and effortless service. I'm a difficult guy to please as far as restaurant food is concerned. My wife is a dedicated carnivore whereas i am vegetarian, in Singapore this means i get 'the vegetarian option' whatever that is (usually uneventful and involving soggy zucchini) with over a third of the menu at Pyxiemoss being veggie friendly, and despite it being communal dining i was spoiled for choice. The chef even created a special interim dish of leek terrine, port aged cheese and pickled mushrooms which was tangy and moreish. My wife ate all manner of animal, so I can't really give a review of the meat dishes but i was assured that they were exceptional. The sea coconut 'Seaviche' was the highlight for me, fresh and unexpected. The wine-list was concise yet varied and the cocktails crafted with as much skill as the food. I think i probably had one too many.A fantastic evening out and the perfect way to celebrate our wedding anniversary
