Not my first visit here. Will always return to have my japanese fix. Affordable and yummy too! Highly recommended!

I had my birthday celebration there and we ordered salmon sashimi amongst other dishes. The chawanmushi is the best ive eaten so far. The salmon sashimi is so fresh. I had15 slices to myself! Please try other sashimi platter too. Value for money.

Cheap sashimi on mon and thurs! Good and fresh sushi but its a little pricey. Must make reservation coz the night queue gets really long!

It used to be one of our favorite place to go for great Jap food but the portion was much smaller and no value for money. Most importantly, it doesn't taste as great. It is obvious to see how much lesser is the crowd now.
5
Standing Sushi Bar had us sold on our first visit there. We ordered two unassuming donburi(s) and the taste and quality of the food absolutely blew us away upon the first bite! Definitely returning for the sushi rolls next!

Food is delicious. Service is ok. Location is easy to find near City Hall MRT. The restaurant's deco is simple

Got the all salmon all the time making on wednesday dinner, which means half price. The taste was great, the aburi salmon melts in your mouth, sauce was delicious. I've also attached the Wednesday promo menu for reference.It's rather pricey normally, but recommend a try for the salmon maki at least during promo time. You have to dine in though

Expecting a nice dinner after reading reviews. It was disappointed. Basic hot green tea tasted like plain water. Got it change n told waitress I like it strong n still got a lousy cup of green tea. Ordered the beef n was bad. Burnt n hard n no taste. Wat saves the dinner was the sushi but nothing to rave abt. As it's ordinary. Hope the food standard can be improved.

This was a little off of the tourist path we often find ourselves on in the CBD area. It was walkable from Clarke Quay but the directions given by our phone were a bit off.I was very impressed by the $3.00 salmon sashimi, the sunset and aburi salmon rolls were also delicious.I'd return to any of these outlets on a return trip given the freshness and how tasty the serves were. Even though it was a Monday night there were plenty of reserved tables. I'd probably book in the future, it did not cross my mind to do so this trop

My colleagues and I orders their bento set, and I must say it's very worth the money. Food is fresh and yummy! Heard they have other more exciting promo from mon-Thur, and sun, will try come back again, altot I suspect need to book super early and queue

Was there on Sunday and a salmon rice bowl. At 50% off - value for money and ingredients were fresh. Delicious!
5
Great japanese food, quality is better than your usual japanese restaurants. The price is also affordable.

Famous for their promotions but the food sadly lacking in quality.
Rice in particular was poorly done. Mushy and with too much vinegar in the mix.
5
There was promotion on Sunday and it was value the money. Food and service was good and service too.
1
Highly disappointed. Poorly trained service staff, with low self awareness and oblivious of what customer orientation means.
3
The sushi here is average. Prices are average. No ambience to talk about. Tables are too close. Service is also average.
4
Waitress were attentive and kept refilling my green tea when it's almost empty. Mentaiko chawanmushi is really good and hotSalmon sashimi was thick and fresh too.
5
It was a great experience, as reservations were done in advance, service at the restaurant was fast. The food is fantastic usual.
5
Known for sushi rolls, have to try Rockstar, and those sushi with the mentai sauce.
Service is attentive, with them refilling green tea constantly.

Every time I return to this place, the food never fails to amaze me. This is the place to go for quality sushi and sashimi. In fact, the food is so good, I'm always really tempted to not order more and end up busting my wallet!I ordered the potato aburi, gyu don with garlic soy dressing, san don with swordfish, salmon sashimi, Under The Sea and All Salmon All The Time. All of them are so good, I don't even know which to recommend! Okay, but if I were to choose one, go for the potato aburi. It is really unique and delicious!This is definitely a place I would visit again, and do look out for special promotions on different days

Sashimi was super fresh and the service was very good as well. Will definitely go back again. Heard they have a weekday offer so I'll be back on a weekday!!
1
Really shocked to see the small portion especially the fried rice. Quality of food was really bad Witt the price paid. Do not recommend!
3
Came here for dinner and ordered the teriyaki chicken and chicken Karage. While the rice is pretty nice the chicken is just average. Service is average as well.
4
Well located sushi bar in the heart of the arts. Try the rice don's that go for 50% off on Sundays. Sushi is always good as well. Recommended.
4
The food was good, value for money especially on their daily offers. The sashimi was fresh, although some food portion may be a little small.
5
The seats were reserved and we did not have to wait. The food was excellent. A pleasant experience indeed.
2
Food was mediocre - sushi were poorly made (you can tell by the way it was sliced). Most ridiculous thing was the octopus - $8 for two TINY octopus was seriously a ripoff. Not coming back here again
4
Had the sushi donburi and the 'under the sea' maki which was chef's special. Friend had the sushi and salmon roe donburi. Not blown away but decent food. For the quality of food though, I think they are bit expensive compared some similar establishments. Their miso soup is somewhat different with chunky veg n chicken, I prefer the traditional miso soup lot more. Suggest go during happy hours when they have some great promotions like salman sashimi for 5 bucks, and good drink options.

Had lunch with an ex colleague and close Friend. This is my third time there. We ordered the lunch menu combination with salmon as The Central feature. Cost 19 sgd and comes with a fresh salad, miso soup, salmon sushi, salmon sashimi, edamame beans and a tiny dessert. Very fresh and very tasty. My Friend had the pork combination and the second time the Friend chicken. Food was excellent - recommend this place highly

I enjoyed the vegetarian rice dish I ordered and my kids enjoyed the sushi, which seemed of good quality. What I did not appreciate was the unfriendly service. Very cold, basic service to start with and, when they got our dessert order wrong (even though she had repeated it back to us) and I asked her to change the flavor of ice cream, I actually got an eye roll! We will not be returning.
5
We came quite late, had only 30 min left for dinner but we wanted sushi no matter what ... ordered some of their signature roles, they have a huge menu, the sushi was trully great and price seemed fair ...
4
The foods are quite nice looking and taste not bad. The salmon is very fresh. Free flow of green tea.
3
They are fast, it's a typical lunch place. Not that cheap if you take a good selection of fish but I would come back again.
1
Went on a Saturday morning, there were only 2 other tables but food took more than 30 minutes to come. Not to mention service staff had really black faces. Food was okay only.

I went to some standing sushi bars in Japan - irritating (a stool doesn't take up much room) but ok for sushi since you can be in and out quickly. It didn't work very well for the standing steak bar that I went to, though.Anyway, despite the name, there is no standing room here, mostly normal tables with a few stools at a high table. Big range of sushi and I thought it was good quality. You can't really get cheap meals unless you choose just a couple of rolls or sushi pieces, but the sets, costing in the region of $20, have quite a lot of food in them and are certainly worthwhile if you want a lot of fish (plenty of other Japanese food too)

Patronized the outlet in Income@Raffles. Arrived early to beat the lunch crowd, and ordered a Garlic Gyu Don set. Came with miso soup and a Japanese mochi as dessert.The miso soup wasn't the kind i like and tasted a little off, but the Gyu Don was terrific. I really liked the beef slices and the lightly-seared fragrance coming from it, as well as the wobbly soft-boiled egg served on top of the rice.But while the food is quite good, service was not so good. They're pretty slow -- took a while for them to serve the food after we placed our orders. And the price is definitely quite steep.If the price could be a little more reasonable, I don't suppose I'd mind eating here regularly. But given their pricey food, I'll probably come only once in a while, when I feel like I need some good Jap dons

Came here for lunch today with a friend and opted for the chirashi set lunch whilst my friend chose a regular sushi lunch set. His meal was served more or less straight away but for some reason mine took about 20 mins to arrive, so that I started after he had already finished. Food was tasty enough but the service definitely needs some improvement
4
Food was good, it's my second visit to this branch. The restaurant had less than 5 groups of people when I reached, I wished that they could be more attentive to the customers rather than talking amongst themselves.Presentation of the food is good, sashimi is quite fresh as well, worth the money. I will go back for the food.

Went on a Sunday and they were having up to 50% off their Dons, ordered a total of 3 dons.Portion was good and we were very pleased except that the rice had a rather salty taste. Might be the vinegar they put for the sushi rice but it got a bit too much too handle after about 3/4 of the bowl. Sashimi was fresh. They were having promo for the lobster as well, not as fresh but worth the money as they did the lobster in 2 ways. (Soup was yummy). Desserts were overpriced, plating nice but taste was average. Service was good, could have sped up with the clearing of plates though, our table was very small for 5 pax. Place was small in general and noise levels were high

Came back here for a 2nd visit this week for drinks after work. The happy hour is remarkably good value: $5++ for beers, sake and selected small dishes of food. Only lasts until 7pm though so you have to make the most of it whilst you can! Doesn't seem to get too busy though so probably not the place to go if you're looking for a noisy pub to start your night
