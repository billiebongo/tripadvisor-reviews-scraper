Went there for an evening after dessert treat. Wanted to try something different from the usual ice cream cafes. Loved the variety and flavours. Thoroughly enjoyable.

This establishment was a surprise find.I tried the Vietnamese style stewed beef brisket - it came with generous chunks of brisket served in its light broth, carrots, potato wedges and nicely toasted sourdough.All tasted good and the broth was balanced (not overly rich).I gave an “Average” instead of “Very Good” rating as I prefer my broth to be hot instead of warm, and the briskets were not as tender as I liked.I am sure that the friendly staff would have obliged if I had made a request to have it heated again.The eggs, avocado and toast set my wife ordered was not on the menu but the staff were very helpful and happy to accommodate her request.This is a nice place to visit for a simple and reasonably priced meal

Sugarhaus is located in the small, and rather dated Serene Centre on Bukit Timah Road at Farrer Road - but don't let that put you off. For some years it was only a purveyor of good cakes, pastries, ice cream and beverages (I spied some very tasty-looking meat pies to takeaway), but more recently it added a steak place: "Fat Belly" that opens in the evenings. The menu is very limited, but what's on offer is good. Our short rib steaks were excellent, and well-cooked (not well done!), and we chose truffle fries and creamed kale for sides - both very tasty. The wine list is equally short, but just as good. Our glasses of Aussie shiraz were a good match for the steaks. No starters, but there are desserts - a choice of three, and ours were as good as the rest of the meal.The good food, plus pleasant, efficient service, and very reasonable pricing, make this a must-go place if you are in the area, and yearn for a decent steak

I was actually here for Fat Belly, the sister resto that serves only 2 mains (beef - flat iron & short ribs on their menu). For the price, the steak quality was really good. The sides were just as nice - sauteed mushrooms, truffle fries and creamed kale. Yummy. For desserts, we moved seats to Sugarhaus and had the "deconstructed lemon meringue" and mint choc ice-cream

During hotter days, one does not feel like eating much during lunch. Knowing the various options for dining around Cluny Court, walking past Sugarhaus made me pause. The food menu is highly limited and portions are not large, the music is soothing yet chic and not overpowering conversation, the ice-cream and waffles are the biggest draws, and the choice to go in and try a new place was not misplaced. Nice small varied selection of Dilmah teas. Homemade chicken potpie?Ordering a coconut sorbet to start, I was informed by a main staffer (who was obviously not a student) that the chicken potpie would take approximately 15 minutes to be ready, because they were making it from scratch. Dilmah's Arabian Mint Tea with Honey was a good complement to what I ordered. The coconut sorbet was rich in coconut and refreshing. You help yourself to water, the cups were clean and neatly stacked, and the water was obviously clean and properly prepared beforehand, because I did not get a stomachache. I was not expecting to them to be so precise, and the pie truly took 15 minutes to be retrieved from the kitchen, so I was impressed. The pie comes with a small serve of tasty potato crisps. For $8, some might consider the pie to be small. The crisp crust is flaky and not overly-oily, and breaking into it hastily without care might shower you with pieces of crust. The chicken and mushrooms were decently tasty, I appreciated the restraint in not going overboard with cream/milk/dairy and salt in the broth, and there was no MSG. This food item is a good-sized serving for tea or for a small lunch, but I wish there were slightly more contents in the pie. That said, paying $16.50 in total for everything seemed value-for-money and well-priced to me, especially when one considers the exorbitant rents in Singapore for F & B. If there is an obvious minus, it is not the cafe itself, but certain cafe goers sitting indoors and selfishly hogging the air-conditioned tables for 1 cup of coffee or one scoop of ice-cream while copiously using their laptops and/or holding long discussions (even after they have finished what they have bought from Sugarhaus), which results in tables not being available for much longer than they should be, and therefore inconveniences new patrons as well as the cafe itself. Student patrons showed far more consideration than certain adults. I was fortunate to have gotten a table indoors. I hope Sugarhaus can expand certain items on their food menu ie to 10 choices, which would be enough, but that depends on what the kitchen can cope with. Given what I have tasted, I would venture back to sample the waffles and maybe the cakes, and am not averse to ordering a pie again

I so badly want to give this place a 5 stars. You really can't fault it for the quality of the food they push out and the price they charge. Seriously ... its really great. There's just that little thing ... speed and service. It all feels a little chaotic, unsure and frantic. For example ... The menu is small and it should not take forever to make a waffle. But it does - even if you're the only person in the store. It's not uncommon for a waffle to take 15 to 20 minutes to prepare ... from pre-prepared batter?!?!Today was the straw that broke the camels back. It was fuller than usual. Being a regular - I placed my order and went shopping - informing them that I would be back in 10 minutes. I arrived to frantic staff (students) trying to make sense of the orders. I politely informed them that they could call me when my waffle was ready (as I live above the store). After an hour past ... I walked down to find a entirely new group of customers chomping on waffles ... mine was nowhere in sight. Yes ... they were no-doubt eating mine. Sensing my frustration ... I was given a complementary coffee (I don't drink coffee - anyways). I left again after being informed that the machine had suddenly started giving problems and it would need to be cleaned. They would call me shortly.45 minutes later - I was finally contacted to collect my waffles. They were cold and dry. Seriously?!?And while I'll invariably continue to support them (due to proximity) - I will bring sufficient entertainment in future / book in order to kill time. The decision to hire students is a smart one. It keeps the energy levels up. But one does expect some degree of service that is less remiss of student camp. I suspect the entire staff compliment are students. And while joking around and laughing make for great ambience ... it gets a little tired when your food is taking forever to prepare. One can only hope that one of the student hires will be a management student. Coz somebody needs to take control of this ship before it sinks! Tips:- Train your staff.- Keep things professional. - Manage expectation. - Keep some semblance of service ... even if you're catering for "student dollars". It's all a little NeverLand'esque at the moment with the adults out of the picture

Ice creams served here are varied and taste unique and delicious. What makes them better is that the price is so affordable compared to other Ice Creams Cafes. What I like and would highly recommend is getting the ice cream (Dutch Chocolate which is so rich in Flavour yet not so sweet or the unique Sticky Date Flavour with chewy pieces of dates inside) along with the fantastically made waffles which are kinda crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. There are tea time promotions for students like 1 for 1 waffles as well so that's great Ambience is fantastic and provides a good place to study or chat with your friends.
