Great food. Local food. There are about 7 shops serving different types of local food. Inexpensive and very easy on the pocket.

Right next door to the Hotel Boss with a good selection of food and drink in a cool air conditioned room. Easy place to get a $3 meal and drink.

A decent range of food available, this is an average eating place with no frills. Price OK, food OK - edible if hungry but nothing to write home about.

Came to this place whenever we stayed at Hotel Boss. So far I've tasted the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Veggie Rice twice (buffet style, order what you want and pay), Siew Mai and Big Pau at Kimly Handmade Tim sum and Tenderfresh Chicken (forgot what the meal deal was but for sure it was chicken). Overall, the food was okay and the price was reasonable. Pretty standard in Singapore I think

We eat here for 4 days and we tried mostly everything ! Hawker Type Food in a Clean Aircon Surrounding.It is right beside the hotel Boss where I was staying, very convenient and it offered different stalls selling different types of food at affordable prices .The place gets packed during lunchtime and dinner

Went up to the tenderfresh counter to order fried chicken. I told him i needed breast as part of my combo as I only eat white meat. I told him I dont. Mind paying extra for it either. He responded " You dont get to choose" in an extremely rude manner. Meanwhile the door of the kitchen is wide open and you can see all parts of the chicken ready to go, and it was not a busy night at all. Well they lost a sale and I will never return there.

This is an excellent place to savour some of the best hawker food in Singapore, in a very comfortable environment with free internet access. There are loads of choices here and the prices are very reasonable too. It's 24/7 and you will never grow hungry......the food here are absolutely fresh and of highest quality

It's a nice place foor all sorts of Singapore food! The different "shops" offer a large variety of well prepared dishes and the place has a lot of Tabels to sit. The option to Take - away is also given! Overall it's a nice place to eat and drink, and on top ot is cheap!

We tried most of the restaurants around the Hotel Boss and like FoodClique the best. We also loved that the prices were also much better than the other restaurants. Our family was able to find a little bit of something for each of us. The food is ready quickly and everything we had at Food Clique was quite good. Not every stall will be open 24/7, but there will be some stalls open all night, which is fantastic. Foodclique is a decent hawker food court near Lavender Smrt Station in the same building as hotel boss

As is the case in many places in singapore non vegetarians can have a ball. this place not too many veg options but the hot chocolate milo was amazing and we had it everyday bcoz it was good and cheap.
5
Clean, tidy and friendly staff. We were able to purchase food from a hawker style market for $5. Drinks were also available at good prices
3
We were staying at the Hotel Boss which is in the same building as this hawker centre. When we saw the sign that this place is open 24 hours we were excited that we had a place to go to after a night of drinking. Late at night, there were only two options - the dim sum spot and a to go counter of prepared food. The dim sum is really tasty so make sure to try that out & the prepared food counter had some good, simple dishes.During the day, everything else opens. My favorite was Seng Kee Laksa, but be warned that it really packs some heat

It is a small food court with various food (This place has limited number of food stalls) nearby Hotel Boss. It is just 2-3 minutes walk from Hotel Boss' main lobby.What I love about this place is the food was quite good and the price is quite cheap. I ordered Bak Kut Teh and it was only SGD$4.5 without rice (white rice is SGD$0.60). There are also western food (fried chicken, pasta, pizza, etc), fish ball noodle, fried rice and several more.Overall, I highly recommend this food court but avoid this place on lunch time (limited tables and seats)
5
This place is very cheap, compared to SEK, I can buy 2 or 3 meals here for the same price for 1 meal in Sweden. So worth it! The atmosphere it's very peaceful and the staff that's remove the plates after you go out is also very kind and wait for you to finish your meal without staring your soul out compared in other countries... no comments on that one. I usually come here first thing in the morning for breakfast and dinner later on. They're fast serving the food so you don't need to wait that long^
5
There are a lot of small restaurants or food stalls where nearluy everyone can find something tasty to eat at a reasonable price. Even if you do not like chinese food you can always find fried chicken or fish and chips, athough in my opinion it would be a shame not to try the local cuisine. TThis place is frequented by the locals and in more busy times of the day it might be a little difficult to find a table
5
I know this foodcourt just walking down from the hotel. Well, many choices you can find here and you will see friendly budget to have food and beverages. The portion and price are worth it. The taste is good. Don't worry, all things are affordable here. Fully recommended

We stayed at Hotel Boss which is situated by Lavender MRT station and this Foodclique is so conveniently located. Housed under the same roof as the hotel it is clean nice and air conditionned. Small court with a dozen stalls offering various asian foods for every taste: hainannese chicken rice, mixed vegetables, american fried chicken, noodle soups. And choices of sweet deserts. All are under 10 singapore dollars with average of 5 bucks. We eat here almost everyday. I recommend this without any hesitation
4
We stayed for a night at Hotel Boss. Foodclique is very convenient specially if you get hungry at the wee hours of the morning. But take note that there at only 5-6 stalls open at around 4am (including the beverage stall and the dessert stall that serves kacang).Tried the Pork mince fish ball soup (#2 in the menu) at SengKee. It was okay.Take note that there is a stall of the famous TianTian Chicken rice here.Place is very clean and well kept
5
We ate here initially as we had arrived very late at night and were staying next door at Hotel Boss. We tried 5 of the stalls in total during our stay and found them to be very good and value for money. You will pay double at somewhere like Bugis Food Junction. We liked the Dim Sum generally S$2/S$2.50 each. The Tian Tian Chicken Rice is very well known - S/M/L portions at no more than S$6 for a large. The vegetable fried rice and noodle stall were also good. If you get the eggs and kaya toast from the drinks stall for breakfast beware they are super soft and runny, possibly a good 2 minutes away from being a traditional soft boiled egg! This food court is open 24 hours but not all stalls are open all the time. Tables were cleared and cleaned efficiently. Small amount of outdoor seating if air con is not to your liking
4
Clean place with lots of seating area...sort of a food court. Food is tasty and very humbly priced. I loved the chicken burger
3
So many varieties of food to choose from. The food is not bad considering that it is cheap and the place is clean.
1
SUB-standards Salad and it's worth S$5.90
Fries are over cooked covered in mayo & cheese worth S$3.50. Totally unacceptable!! ðŸ˜¡
4
Excellent food court with multiple cuisine choices. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the options over here. Food options are predominantly Malay and Chinese.
3
The place is very nice and the staff was also very kind and quick. Prices are low compared to the other fast food places in this food court. Serving was so quick and got the value for the money paid and was tasty as well.
3
Adjacent to the Hotel Boss was a simple food court with good prices and a great selection of dishes. No direct culinary experience but good if you quickly wanted in some food.
4
We went here as it was next door to our hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed it! It was good value and we got to try a lot of different local foods and dishes at a price that meant it didn't matter if we didn't like it! It was always busy and had a good atmosphere.
4
The Foodciique is clean and well maintained by staff. The tables are cleaned continuously and the variety of food leaves you wondering what you will have, decisions, decisions? The cost of a meal is great and the meals sizes are plentiful. Great eating place for families.
5
This clean and tidy food hall is located at lobby level of the Boss Hotel, and offers a great variety of delectable eats. Tian Tian hainan chicken is worth trying and so is the veg/rice stall at the end. The Dim Sum stall is also very good
4
We happened to walk past Hotel Boss when we came across FoodClique. Interestingly, this food court has almost all the more popular local food, including the famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice which operated a stall here. We had chicken rice, salmon teriyaki, fishball noodles, fried kway teow, Japanese fried chicken and ice kacang. All were quite good. We wouldn't mind coming back again, although a wider selection of stalls could be better.
3
First night of our stay. Large choice of chinese food. Everything fried but I'm not sure about the quality of food. For sure, it is cheap. You eat with about 7S$. Anyway, it is a nice solution if you want to stay in the budget.
3
Good food but little choices. It's open 24 hours & very accessible to our hotel since it is located at the ground floor of our hotel, Hotel Boss.
5
very nice place to eat , clean and refreshing ...great food , many choices from breakfast to dinner at reasonable prices ...highly recommended
3
Some options with local and fast food. The food is reasonable, not expensive and convenient since is open 24h (not all the restaurants).

During my recent travel to Singapore during the Holy Week, I ate at this food court everyday for three reasons, namely: it is right beside the hotel Boss where I was staying, very convenient and it offered me 12 different stalls selling different types of cuisine. There's Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Western etc. I particularly liked the stall at the end corner serving 3 viands with rice for about SGD 8.00. I usually have a veggie dish with 2 types of fish and rice. I would say this place is a best kept secret. It is open 24 hrs but come midnight not all of the stalls are open. The place gets packed during lunchtime and dinner. Good choice for a filling meal
4
Clean and air-conditioned. Located at Hotel boss. Prices for food range from $4 -$10 and the portions are reasonable. It is 24 hours but not all the stall are open for 24 hours, only the fishball noodles, the rice/veg stall, the dim sum stall and the drinks stall are open throughout
4
Lots of smaller food court like restaurants connected to the same building as Hotel Boss. Great tasting food. Cheap prices. Eat In the food court or take away. Made me want to come back and sample all the food. Recommended if you are in the area...
4
This is an excellent facility right below the Hotel Boss. It offer varies of food and juice/drinks/coffee offers at a reasonable price. So people staying at this hotel need not travel distances or look for restaurants to eat.Liked the set-up, the food choices and pricing. Most I liked the seating area right out of this place beside the river.

We came to hotel (Boss) late at night (around 11 pm) from Sentosa Island. We hadn't had the proper dinner, only cup of pop corns. The kids are really exhausted and couldn't take any resto even in walking distance range. I remember FoodClique in the ground floor is 24 hour. So I took them here. We were looking for halal food. There are 2 food stalls who provide halal food. But one of them is right to close. So we took the other one. The food is really good. Price is fair. It would be nice to have breakfast here
5
This place was amazing. We tried 3 out of the many food vendors and loved every bite!The food was cheap (especially for a hotel location). Two dinners at one place was only 8.00 SD. Also tried their lemon ice tea; it was very refreshing.Would I go here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend to a friend? Yes
