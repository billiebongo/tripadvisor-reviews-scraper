We went for dim sum with another couple. I was not impressed. The facility itself was old and tired. The servers were particularly unenthusiastic. The dim sum itself was “meh”. I had better at food stalls in local markets. I’d recommend skipping this place.

Dim Sum in one of the oldest Chinese Restaurants. They push you to take food from the trolleys! This is a great Singapore experience with an excellent Dim Sum range

As other reviewers report, you choose your food from carts being pushed around the restaurant. The vendor stamps the cart number on your ticket when you select something. Most dim sums are 4.70 SGD with meat platters priced at 10 SGD. There were only two of us, but four would have permitted us to try more items as there are 3 or 4 items in each serving. We saw few, if any, non-Chinese in the restaurant and none of the servers spoke English so we were going on luck when we picked most items. One gentleman stopped by and helped us avoid shellfish items (allergy). Dim sum is served from morning to about 3 PM. Restaurant reopens at 6 as a full service standard restaurant, I.e., no dim sum. Researvations accepted for dinner, but not lunch

Went for Chinese New Year dinner here. Like the ambience which is very local and wedding dinner setting. Staff were friendly and prompt in service. Food was excellent and reasonably priced. Perhaps will try their dim sum one day. Could be hard to locate this restaurant as there is only a small lift to the main entrance on 7th floor.

I patronised Red Star Restaurant a couple of years ago and recently felt the urge of eating dim sum there again and found the place relatively the same on food, service, deco, etc.As mentioned nothing much has changed, the food's still good except that the bill was a bit on the high side for a simple collection of dim sum.Despite the higher than expected bill price, I would still recommend anyone wishing to savour good old school dim sum to go there

This restaurant is located close to Singapore Chinatown area. Not too easy to find. Very busy during weekends. It is one of the few traditional yum char restaurants where the various dishes are pushed around in trolleys and you choose what you want to eat without knowing is the name of each dish. An inexpensive restaurant and lots of dishes to choose from.

Do you want to find a place where there are no tourists? We have gone twice to find ourselves the only Americans among 500 Chinese Singaporeans chowing down on steaming hot dim sum. As our taxi driver told us, this place is old school— he went there with his parents, but it is fun, the dim sum is better and different than in the US— and you can try everything cheaply. They have soups, Bao, roast duck and crackling pig along with lots of dumplings. Come before noon for a shorter line, but the line moves quickly

We were delighted by this traditional venue and pleased with the tried and true cuisine served in style with a smile. This is Asian options with a cafeteria type feel. Service comes to your table and you decide the variety of table eats. A wonderful place to share a meal and conversation

When a Japanese visitor asked to go to a typical Hong Kong style yum cha place in Singapore, I struggled to recall of such a restaurant. We have many excellent dim sum places but my friend was referring to a no-frills eatery with dim sum offered on trolleys.Red Star was one of our pioneer Chinese restaurants and remains a local favourite for dim sum. And from the dated décor of the rather huge restaurant, they have seen many Chinese wedding banquets too. I can also imagine several weddings at the same time during the popular wedding season.Like I've said the novelty is that the dim sum are served on trolleys. You wait for the trolleys to come, pick your dim sum and the trolley aunties will stamp on a card on your table to keep track of your orders.The dim sum is very traditional and delicious. But if you are expecting fancy and dainty fare, Red Star is not your Orchard Road hotel Chinese restaurant nor Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure.Nevertheless, I like Red Star for its nostalgia. Bring your broadsheet newspaper to read as you yum cha

We had lunch here. Simply good and delicious dim sum at this restaurant. Don’t expect a five stars service or ambiance. Just expect good and delicious dim sum here. We ordered the chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, barbecue pork buns, pork ribs, glutinous rice with Chinese sausages, mushroom and chicken. We also had some porridge. All simply delicious. Will come back again someday.
5
Went with a local who had been many times...loved the atmosphere, great selection of dishes, service was on point

With business friend from vietnam . Dessert is great with Cantonese speaking waiter like those in hk. Range of variety is wide and range of quality is wide too the dessert is great . Tim sum quality vary widely
3
I find the place over-rated, the standard has dropped drastically. There is a lot of hits & misses. The porridge and custard are good. The rest just moderate. Some of the meat dim sum are below average, seemed tough and stale. Service wise is just average, nothing to wow about. The queue can be terrible during lunch time or weekends. Price wise is mid range too, can't say it is really cheap

I visited Singapore for just a couple of days and wanted to try a dim sum restaurant on a Sunday morning. The concierge at my hotel suggested this restaurant. It was about a 15 minute cab ride from the JW Marriott. The food was average and some it wasn’t quite to my liking. The menu was difficult to understand. I enjoyed the jasmine tea. It was simple yet flavorful. The interior of the establishment was quite run down. I wouldn’t recommend it.

I chanced upon this restaurant and decided to have dinner. Food wise, nothing special or great - I had beef horfun, crispy chicken and sambal kang kong. We also asked for iced water. When we asked for the bill, we were shocked that we were charged for the iced water. While I understand some restaurants' policy was to charge for iced water, I could not believe I was charged $2 per glass of iced water! When I clarified with the cashier, she appeared uninterested in explaining to me, but simply said in the future, I should have asked for tea and not iced water. This is indeed bad customer service and I feel that the restaurant should not charge $2 for one glass of iced water and the cashier's horrible attitude really puts me off. So what if you think you serve tasty home-cooked food (to me, it is not even good to begin with)? There are many others restaurants who can do better with good customer service. I hope this can raise awareness among fellow diners to think twice about visiting this restaurant
4
the only problem is to find the place. the taci dropped us there and told us "you have to find the place". Thanks to a chinese lady who showed the way.What an ammazzing experience: food excellent, waitresses are smiling and even if they don't spek or understand English they are out to help you. It reminded me of a chinese restaurant in NY city.You have to go there on saturday for a nice dim sum experience..
3
It's the Red Star Restaurant, probably one of the few old school Chinese Dim Sum restaurants left in Singapore that retains the old decor and layout.. Not many left after the demise of Lucky Restaurant (TPY) and the like.The decor is aged and the food while decent was not overly fantastic, people go there for the old school feeling.If I was to recommend a food item, I would say maybe their Char Siew Baos and the Har Gao.The chicken feet was not soft enough and the porridge only had a tiny sliver of century egg but hey, I guess people are not really here for the food.If you really need to go, do avoid peak hours because the car park can be quite a handful (you have to do a difficult 3 point turn at the top level of the car park if you don't get a parking lot)
4
I went to this restaurant 2 years ago but had no chance to visit there again but I always miss their food a lot!!! good taste with reasonable price but I can remember that their xiong long bao not quite good as I thought (I prefer this dish at Din Tai Fung).Anyway, other dishes are superb. I wish I would had a chance to try those yummy dim sum agai
4
Old nostalgic restaurant that still has pushcarts of dimsum offerings. Servers are helpful and will help you decipher their offerings. Choose what you like and they will run a tab for you. A word of caution, avoid the black sesame dessert; it seems to be factory-produced and was bland. My Singloong brand out of a packet taste so much better

Red Star has been around for the longest time. Located at Chin Swee road it is not easy to find, but once you realise it is just behind the Chinatown People’s Park area (10mins walk from OG taxi stand along the main road and you will reach the building), it really isn’t that difficult. We took a taxi which alighted us the bottom of the block of flats where restaurant was located on the 7th floor. Being a Sunday, we anticipated it would be crowded, thank goodness we were early at 1030hrs thus didn’t have to queue as there were still some tables left available. Nothing too glamourous at this old Chinese restaurant, place has been upgraded however still looks very old school which adds to the fun of dining at a nolstagic place. Atmosphere was slightly boisterious but not irritatingly loud. Staff were efficient to get you seated at your table and soon the aunties operating the various steel pushcarts would swarm to your table plugging their dimsums to you. So you had a few quick seconds to decide what you will eat and what you didn’t wanted. Once they place the food on your table, they will stamp an ink stamp on your table card to record your consumption. All the dimsums we ordered were yummy but my personal faves were Polo Bun ( pipping hot with pineapple jam egg custards), steamed blackbean pork ribs. Price is reasonable as we had 11 trays + Tea which came up to $55. The dining crowd consisted mainly of 3 generation families, some young families with babies and toddlers and also a few dating young ( and old) couples. Staff are mainly elderly aunties who are quite endearing. Loved our visit and will definitely come back for more soon.

Would bring visitors from abroad to this favourite hunt for dim sum. Not many restaurants in Singapore can you find push cart dim sum with ambience and decor of the 90's.
Dim sum were good and price are reasonable.
5
Old place nearby China town in Singapore. You will find a good quality of Dim Sum in this country.
Many kind of Dim Sum ready to serve and taste is really nice.
If you a Dim Sum lover, I suggest to visit this place
5
Located at 54 Chin Swee Rd, #07-23, Singapore 160054. Take Lift A up to 7th floor and you will see the restaurant. Go early before 12 to avoid the crowd and the queue. Good came out on Push carts and you just order what you want from the carts itself from the aunty with your table order sheet. Food was delicious and worth the price! Will be back

I was a little reluctant to return to this place after the really poor service experienced last time, but decided to give it another shot for the dim sum. They have the dim sum carts so the experience is quite authentic, but it was a little more expensive than expected (although I have no complaints about the quality of the food)

11/Feb/2017 - we reached the outlet at around 1.10pm after, what seemed like winning the lottery, wriggling our way into the lift to get us to the restaurant. Maybe thats the norm on Saturdays. The restaurant, huge as it is, quickly filled up.We ordered from the pushcarts - which seemed to be the age-old service staff's priority as the tim sum items have already been cooked and laid out on the trolleys.We concluded this as our request for a la carte menu seemed warped and lost in time.The long service staff know their drill but seemed fixed in their own area of responsibility. Stepping out of their comfort zone seems impossible. We ordered a pudding dessert. One came in a proper bowl. Another came in a disposable plastic ware which served a smaller portion. Both were similarly priced. When asked, the lady stared at us and retreated, cart and all, as though it was closing time.We asked the supervisor, who did better. She didn't stare.. only glanced. But, also, did nothing. Think functional, practical. Forget finesse, customer focus.Whilst discomforting this scene is played out daily and customers still flood the place no end... especially on Saturdays

Red Star is one of those famous restaurants that has survived from the 1970s. The waitresses still push the dim sum around in trolleys. I have been there a few times. When crowded, and if you are seated at one corner, the food may never get to you. The food is nothing to shout about. Check youlr bill. On one visit, I was accidentally charged for dishes I never ordered.oStill worth a visit if you have not been here
4
I've eaten here at least 3 or 4 times previously. It's the kind of place that locals know but is far enough "off the beaten path" to be relatively unknown to foreign visitors. The food here is very traditional Chinese/Cantonese dim sum, and good quality. They bring the food around on trolleys and small platefuls. To get the best out of it at a reasonable price I recommend groups of at least 3 or 4 people rather than alone or as a couple.The food is good, but they tend to be in a bit of a hurry for you to take more than you can reasonably eat. The spring rolls for example are big, and they will only serve you 3 of them at a time. If you're a light eater you might only want to eat half of one. Anyway it's all quite nice, and I think if you're in Singapore's Chinatown it's a good experience, and for not much money if you skip the beer and just go with Chinese tea. Budget around S$22 per head.This place is a bit difficult to find, it's on the 7th floor of a housing development board (HDB) estate around 500 metres north of entrance C of Chinatown MRT Station
4
It's really the old style Hong Kong yum char lau 饮茶楼 - time warped back to the 70s and 80s. I remember quite vividly how I used to "hang out" with my grandfather in old Chinatown where he would have his tea, reading his newspapers, chatting with his mates and 1 couple of dim sum dishes... and I was too engrossed with my char siew bao to worry about anything else!Yes Red Star brings back fond memories of my childhood in Chinatown! And my long gone grandfather!The decor is super ornate and stuck in time! The servers not quite that old, but a few still mumbling in perfect Cantonese... and the food carts, moving steamers and fryers still made their way to your table... "Char Siew Bao", "Har Gao, Siew Mai, Lor Mai Gai"... "Cheong Fun".... filled the air! So nice to see old style dim sum served in the well preserved manner... savour this before the "modern productivity and innovation" movement swallows up tradition with iPad-ordering!The food... well, not bad... I'd give it a 4 out of 5. The Char Siew Bao is good, Cheong Fun must-try... and the usual dim sum dishes are still good. What's missing is not the dim sum, but the accompanying chilli sauce - dried chilli in chilli oil - that's missing and very good mayo-salad dip to go with the har kok (prawn dumpling) and the undiluted LP sauce for the Fu Pei Guin (soya curd skin roll) and spring rolls! SIGH! The small things matter very much!Still I will be back for more of the nostalgia, Cantonese exchange and banter... before it gets modernised to the point of losing its identity, its uniqueness and the origin of HK-style yum cha

Found this place after online research, took some finding nearly walked past it if I hadn't looked up and saw the sign, have to go into elevator in a building that looks empty to the seventh floor where you'll find a big restaurant serving traditional dim sum being wheeled around by ladies, great food away from tourist area but only a short walk from Clarke Quay, a must do if you enjoy dim sum and the earliest opening place you'll find in a generally late opening city
2
I never want to step into Red Star Dim Sum Restaurant due to very poor attitude of the waitresses there. A waitress told my family that we will be charged for tea irregardless of whether we order or not. They seemed to be very unhappy when we rejected the prickle which was placed on our table. Thereafter, no one come forward to take order of our food. Regretted not leaving the restaurant immediately. Compared to the past, the food standard has also dropped. Not worth going any more
4
This is the best yum Cha we have had in Singapore , the service and the best thing about this is the food is so good and delisheous.
4
One of the rare few places that still has the push cart Dim Sum. A very large restaurant with lots of seats. The Dim Sum choices are plenty. Dim Sum is for breakfast & lunch. The restaurant serves Cantonese ala carte dishes at dinner.
4
Tried this for the first time with my friends over the weekend! Food was decent - the custard bun and the honeydew sago dessert were my favourite!
2
We weren't very impressed. According to my mother-in-law this place used to be way better. Dishes lacked ingredients, were served cold and service was rather poor. It was far too expensive. Ambience however, was quite nice.
3
Have been this resturant for.years when I was a kid back 20 over.years ago. The standard some how dropped. Forget about service level but it is not worth the money to dine in red.star resturant where there are.many good dim sum resturant such as Poey jade resturant at keppel club. Pricing wise acceptable.and good ambience. Need to.book as they can be very busy.
1
We were recommended this place by our taxi driver and turned up at 9pm on our last day IN Singapore. A lady walks up to us the minute we walked through the door and announced that there were no tim sum available and the kitchen closed at 10pm. Seeing that we had an hour, we asked if we could order something; she flat out said no, can't cook. I don't think they need business from tourists. Very disappointing
3
Our regular place for Tim Sum! They serve wide variety of Tim Sum, average you need to pay about $20 per person. Understand their air cons have breakdown for 3 weeks, will suggest to call whether has this been fixed before you que about 1/2 an hour for your seats and to eat in a warm and crowded place!
3
The food was just average. We were recommended to go there to experience "traditional" dim sum. Maybe we should have been on a Sunday to really experience it. We went there for lunch on a Wednesday and there were only a few occupied tables in the huge hall. Service wasn't better from what you'd expect from a traditional chinese restaurant, even if they weren't busy. The food was ok but seemed slightly overpriced. Not expensive for dim sum, but you can definitely get "finer" dim sum for that price
4
I pretty impressed when I step in the restaurant. The interior is kinda traditional Hong Kong dim sum style with traditional push cart. Highly recommend the custard bun and do not forget to order the red bean patties (豆沙窝饼), because it's need to wait up to 30 minutes
4
There used to be a time when the food Standard was getting lower and I stopped coming since. But due to the nostalgic atmosphere that the restaurant has, I've decided to come back this couple of weeks; several times.The food quality and taste standard have improved quite a fair bit. It's very encouraging as the restaurant is still an icon today at China town.
3
Went for a meal on a Tuesday night. Ordered squid balls and a seafood & pan fried noodle dish.
Very average - I'd be hard pushed to say it was any better than Bamboo Garden in Lewisham.
5
Singapore only truly authentic Tim Sum if you are serious about Yam Cha. Hundreds of Tim Sum in push cart, served to your table by aunties. The Tim Sum was great and kind of back to the 70's. Highly recommended
4
Was intro by my niece n nephew. We had a great time at tis restaurant. Dim sum was loaded into trolley, Lots of choices .For the famous roast duck you need to wait till around 9-930am for it to be ready to serve.Aircond was superb for a hit n sunny day. Great place for family gatherin
4
I have been eating at this place more than a decade ago. Still manage to maintain its quality. Try to avoid going there during public holidays as the queue will be beyong imagination. Good for old folks as it will recall a lot of good memories
3
There was a time the food was unpretentious and the servers actually knew the food and what was happening in the kitchen...Red Star it is. Old style dim sum picked off circulating trolleys manned by the old staff. If you are looking for some of the new versions of dim sum this isn't the place. Go if you want food like what it used to be and the atmosphere.
4
Looking from outside one would think a small restaurant being on the 7th floor, but what a surprise when you walk in - ballroom size well appointed restaurant. Great menu choices and drinks list with reasonable prices. The food we had was absolutely fabulous, and the service staff friendly and on the ball. No need to wave them down for a second drink. We can recommend the Yam Ring and Shredded duck noodles - yum.Yum cha dim sum is available daily. We'll be back.Cheers Niels & Mary, Hunpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Unde

There are much better Dim Sum options in SingaporeI brought my parents here for dim sum on the recommendation of friends. I wasn't particularly impressed it. The restaurant is pretty rundown. The food selection was poor (admittedly, we were here during the week - but there were only about 7 plates to choose from). The food quality wasn't that great either. It was difficult to flag anyone down for service (e.g. Tea). To compound matters, it's not the easiest place to find. I won't be coming back. Maybe if I loved close by, it would be something I would go to occasionally because it's convenient.
3
Food standard seems to have dropped compared to the past. Service like before.. so so, never the main draw. No pre booking allowed. Price fair. OK for family meal out but not a place for bringing guests esply if foreigners. Reasons- noisy and service not too good
4
This used to be one of our favourite dim sum place but we have not been here for more than 3 years. We went there last weekend because of our group size, we needed wheel chair access and we wanted dim sum. The restaurant was still as crowded and noisy as before. One of the favourite thing about this restaurant was the push cart concept of serving dim sum and we still saw many of them running around this big restaurant. The varieties of dim sum cater were still very good and catered for all tastes . We all agreed that the food standard has been consistent and still very authentic. We stayed for 2 hours+ and spent $303 for 14 of us, and overall it's still value for money and enjoyable
4
I have been going to Red Star on and off over the years, and haven't been for a while. We went this weekend because we wanted a dim sum place that would allow you to chill and read the newspaper while you have your meal. I was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant crowded. All the old favourite elements are still there: the push carts laden with food, the Chinese decor, the elderly wait staff. Some tips if you're unfamiliar with this place:1. Park on level 6 if you drive and walk up one flight of stairs to the restaurant. The restaurant is on level 7, and the only lift is slow and almost always full during meal times. The multi-storey car park leads you directly to the restaurant but not available on level 7. The one flight of stairs will be much quicker than waiting for the lift.2. DIY if you're hungry. The aunties will come by with their push carts, which is part of the charm. However, that may take a while, especially if you're seated in one of the corners of the restaurant. So, grab your table card, and take a stroll around the restaurant if you or the kids are hungry and can't wait
4
Lots of space for seating. Trolleys of dimsums makes it way around. Lots of food options to cater for all tastes. Very authentic feel. However for my visitors I would probably take them to din tai fun for their taiwanese and Chinese dimsums plus more.
5
Traditional old chinese place to hang out with family. They waiters serve you in cart by taking around various dishes and you pick and choose what you want.
The food is great and reasonably priced. A place worthy of visiting at least once.
3
The food standard and variety has been consistent for decades though many new dim sum restaurants have sprung up. It's the push cart kind of offering which reminded me of older days. The fried yam ball was the most memorable item, piping hot with right blend of yam and minced pork. Pricing has gone up considerably, hence we will likely not return as better quality dim sum and service done the ala carte way could make our meal more enjoyable.
4
We are here for our lunch. One time I like is they still have the push cart concept where we seldom see it nowadays. They have some nice dim sum such as century egg porridge, prawn flitter, Liu sha Bao (custard bun) and steamed rice noodle roll.All the waitress were very friendly especially name tag 7 m who went extra mile to help us. The waitress serve porridge was very nice too. I wanted to help her (quite old lady) to take the porridge to our table but she insisted to do it herself.We spent $103 for 4 paxs with about 20 plates.
4
Location: it's a little hard to find, it's located on the 7th story and there is only 1 lift. On weekends, reach early (before 10am) to avoid Long queues, which can reach up to 1hr waiting time. It's popular with locals, families, and it's a well established dim sum restaurant in Singapore.Food: push cart-style dimsum, you pick what you like and the waitresses will chop against the card menu. There's fried items like prawn dumplings, youtiao, steamed items like siewmai, hargao, chicken feet etc as well as other common dim sum items like congee, dessert, glutinous rice. There's a really wide variety of dishes to choose from.Service: ok. But the restaurant is so busy you have to try hard to get the attention of waitresses to refill your tea, get sauces, utensils. Sometimes I end up having to self-service

We have been here numerous times for its dim sum breakfast and lunch during weekends and public holidays, as well as ordering from the a la carte menu for weekday lunches and dinners. The seating capacity is pretty large, but be prepared to queue and wait for quite a while if you are having dim sum breakfast during the weekends. You basically queue for a carpark lot and then a table at the restuarant.Dim sum during breakfast and lunch is serve the old-school way - trolleys being pushed in the restuarant to serve the customers. More often then not, the trolleys do not get to move much as impatient customers walk up to the trolleys to order food items, instead of waiting for the trolley to pass by. Unless you have a lot of time on hand or are reading your newspapers, you tend to do the same. The food on the menu is decent too. The roast chicken, braised pork leg and hor fun, among others, are excellent. Some of the reviews here mentioned about the service level. Well, the service here is patchy. Some of the staff are fantastic and attentive, while there are some whom I wonder why they are in the service industry at all. Nonetheless, customers do not seem to bother much about the service level, and it's the food that brings the crowd in. This restaurant has been around for ages, and judging from the hordes of locals queueing for food, it must be doing something right
1
Came here for a CNY dinner having last visited maybe 8 years ago. On the plus side the food is actually quite decent. On the negative side is the service which is truly appalling with some of the rudest staff I've seen in Singapore, combined with very long gaps between courses. Really there are far better places to go. I doubt we will be back here again
5
On 7th floor, not easy to find or come across if you are not familiar with the area. Huge selection of different dim sum dishes, very efficient pushcart service. We spent 4 hours with a group of friends enjoying the variety of different things. Would suggest a must for anyone looking for traditional dim sum
3
Was told this place by a cab driver on the way from the airport. Thinking it was excellent, we took a trip after hotel check-in. Turns out to be average only. Plenty of locals though suggesting otherwise. Short cab-ride from Orchard Road, from memory about $7. Take the lift from ground floor to level 7
4
Went on the 1st of Jan with family for our first meal. Was crowded but the queue was moving fast... One of the best place to eat dim sum in Singapore with push cart style normally use in Hong Kong... The only disappointment was the porridge...
3
Dim sum is good, affordable but not a place for people whose's expecting good customer service. Pushcart available but customers have to 'wait for their turn' to be served and you may face so difficulty identifying which cart is serving your favorite food :)
3
Last few places in Singapore that serve dim sum on trolley service.
Standard dim sum staples found every where.
Go there for the atmosphere of large, noisy dim sum places of yesteryear, or to bring overseas guests for interesting dining experience .
4
Sunday morning go for breakfast need to wait for 1 hours plus. Best you can get someone to go que up 1 hour before. Food variety alot but must wait for the trolley to come.
4
Bring back memories of the old days with dim sum served on strolling carts. Not the place if you want fine dining but if you want good humble food at reasonable price this is the place. The Siew mai and Har Kow are reasonable in size. In many restaurants these are getting smaller and smaller. They have a giant Pow that is six inches in diameter. No kidding ! The Pei tan porridge is tasty. Dont order the three meat dish of duck, roast pork and char Siew. Big plate that cost $30. MeT so so .
4
A huge variety of tasty dim sum dishes that will leave you spoiled for choice. Not to mention, it's reasonably priced (our total bill came up to $157 for 4 and). The ambience is great, with aircon, proper seats and amenities. Interesting concept as well because the waitresses go around pushing carts of food instead of you ordering from a menu. The paper wrapped chicken (纸包鸡) is simply heavenly
4
Tim Sum on the old-school steamer trolleys. Not easy to find in Singapore.Tim Sum are generally tasty, although standards drop over the years.Do try the crispy roast pig skin, roast duck, roast meat, porridge, Siew Mai, Har Gao, deep fried soft shell crab, char Siew pastry, cold pig trotter, sweet and sour pig trotte
3
Im surprised it is not too packed with customer like me on a weekday. The dim sum is steaming hot when served and that makes it mouthwatering. Try a few dishes and glad that I made the right choice to eat here. Keep up with good food! I'll be back
3
Can't remember the last time I was there but the settings definitely did not change. The service was acceptable, don't really understand why some reviews mentioned the push cart staff were aggressive. Just say "no thank you" if you do not want the dishes from the cart and they will walk away. Always ask to be seated so that the staff will show you a table and give you an order chit. Of course if you are going at peak hours like Sunday 9am, expect queue and slow service. Food to me is so so, but I am comparing with higher end restaurants. In summary, a good experience especially for tourist and those that have not tried push cart style dim sum.

After trying many of the small restaurants near the Holiday Inn Express in Clark Quay, I was so happy to find this local gem. Situated on the 5th floor of a government housing estate, Red Star Restaurant serves good Cantonese food. Please note, I said "the 5th floor of a government housing estate", so don't expect fancy, it is very local and I read it has been around since the 70s. My guess is the recipes (They didn't know how bad MSG was for you back then), staff and decor have been too. I had dinner, fried rice and fish with vegetables, both just out of the wok (remember to tell them NO MSG). Service was quick, the portions big and the staff were friendly. Looking at other reviews it looks like that may not always be the case.I will be back. I plan on having brunch there tomorrow
4
We stayed at the nearby Hotel Re! during the hazy period and hence at times, we were limited to very local eats such as the Red Star Restaurant where we returned on two more occasions during our stay. During lunch, they serve the traditional push-cart with food, Yum Cha style (recommended by one of the taxi drivers) and it certainly did not disappoint. While some may say this is a sub-optimal comparison, but we felt that it was better than any in Melbourne, Australia (and the same is true for any small local eats compared to the Asian foods served in Australia). For dinner, it's a la carte but definitely worth trying the fried tofu with crab and broccoli - we loved that dish (and ordered it twice!).On occasions, it may seem deserted (contrasting with an almost fully packed weekend lunch) but do not let that sway you from dining here.
5
I love dim sum and this place didn't disappoint! It's not in a touristy area, so if you don't know about it, you won't just pass it by. The restaurant is huge and there's so much variety. Get there early, this place gets packed!
5
There is nothing flash about Red Star but you'll find fabulous dishes quickly served in this no authentic yum Cha restaurant amidst HTB apartments near Chinatown. Definitely worth venturing out to; ask for directions and take lift to level 7.

We brought overseas relatives there and they enjoyed it very much, especially the dim sum on the hot steaming trolleys. Because we went after the morning crowd, we got a better attention friendly service.
3
This place is good if you are keen to step back to the 70s.
Dimsum is only average quality and somewhat oily... But that's how we used to do it!
Overall, just enjoy the atmosphere!
3
If you are keen to revert to 30 years back, go there. Huge place. Reservation is a joke. Walk in, seat anywhere. Choose carefully. Leftovers are all over the place. Stick to the knowns. Aggressive behavior will set you back. Good luck.

We used to eat yum char often, but don't get to eat yum cha/dim sum often these days, so it was a great treat to have lunch here.Great service, lots of cheeky waitresses trying to get you to try their goods. Everything we ordered was delicious. Lots of hot tea being continually replenished. It's a fun lunch with a group of people so that you can try lots of variety from the endless carts being wheeled around. If you haven't tried this style of food, it's a great place to try

This restaurant did not really upgrade nor renovate her setting and kept her retro style. Hence, when you step into Red Star, it feels like you are lunching in a typical 1960s Singaporean restaurant - I liked that experience. Service was not impressive but they push their dim sum around in old fashioned carts like those used in olden Hong Kong. Food is above average; quite good to some extent. Expect a queue

We had dim sum here after hearing about it for the longest time. The place is seriously a place that time long forgotten, from the tacky decor to that odd smell you get when you first walk through the doors.The first thing that happens the moment you get your table is that you're swamped with waitresses wielding their old fashioned push carts. The bunch of them are pushy and to some point rude as they try to peddle their wares and try leaving extra plates of food on your table. It almost seems like they have a sales quota of some sort to meet. Be firm when you don't want something and tell them off if you have to.The food here really isn't impressive at all. The roast pork tasted overly salty and skin wasn't crispy so to me, it was an utter failure. The roast duck was barely passable.We ordered the usual staple of har gau, siew mai amd char siew pau. Those we pretty alright. We found a plate of marinated octopus which everyone swears they never ordered ( be extra vigilant of this scam).Service wise leaves much to be improved. From the pushiness of the push cart ladies to the fact that getting refills of hot water took the entire meal and when you order 2 portions of porridge, only one portion comes and they don't bother reacting to your order. This place has been famed to be old school and is a place best left in the past and forgotten. Wouldn't recommend it cos you're paying quite a bit for that ordeal

This restaurant is located at 54 Chin Swee Road. Food was cooked to the correct temperature but the price was not relative to the venue rental. It was a bit on the high side. Service is average as it was on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was packed. Typical Cantonese tim-sum with chinese tea
4
A little far from the centre but worth it.Old fashioned place but fresh food being brought out all the time so that it is actually hot.Perhaps our best meal in S'pore during 5 days.Don't look at the decor & compare to all those flash restaurants or dirty Hawker centres.We really enjoyed it- much more than all those fancy 5 Star hotels where old food is microwaved & served on fancy plates in a freezing cold environment!We thought the service was great- give them a Big smile
4
Went with family and tasted delicious dimsun. It got very asian flavor, coming from trained chefs/cooks, place and servers are good.
4
Good timsum. Traditional trolleys. Although standards have dropped over time from my childhood days, still considered good.
3
If you love a grimy and greasy atmosphere, this is the place to be. Walking in is like walking in the Chinese restaurants of my childhood. Service is fast and fuss free. The dim sum is served from a push cart. The portions are generous. For me, dim sum must be delicate, light-handed, little bits of perfection. At Red Star, they are robust and inelegant. So if you like the bold taste of pork, prawn and oil, you will love this. I like the skins in my har gao, bao, and siew mai thin and translucent, filled with good quality ingredients. So I don't think I'll go back again.
2
This is one of the few places that you can eat yum cha from the trolley in Singapore. The restaurant is located in an hdb area near the cbd. The restaurant itself is very large and they don't take bookings on weekends (I was told there are long queues). The place has a nice feeling to it but the food is average at best. You can't compare the dim sum to any of the Chinese restaurants located in the hotels etc. the food just does not make it here. I will not be returning.

At 9am, there was already a long queue outside the resto. Could be a good/bad sign depending how you look at it but for me it’s a good sign because I believe it means the place is popular rather than due to other reasons like.. non-existence service. This time I was proven wrong.We were shown to our table and waited 5min for the dirty plates to be cleared. Shouldn’t the plates be cleared first? Then we waited 10min before someone came to lay a clean cloth over the table. We later discovered that we cannot order food because no one has come to give us the order chit. Thinking that I’ve overlooked the chit, I approached the counter for it and was told to wait. So you cannot take one yourself but to wait. After 10min, I approached a staff who was giving out order chit at another table, because no one seem to come to our table. And I was told to wait, she will come over. After another 5min we finally able to order food. Out of the 5 service staffs that we talked to, only one has a smile on her face (kudos to her). The rest retort like we owe them money. Nevermind, perhaps they were overworked. The dimsum is nothing fantastic. And considering the price it’s definitely nothing to shout for (I actually had a bill shock). Dimsum was served on push-carts, and those push-carts are far and few in between. We saw many impatient customers approaching the carts to take the food themselves because it was just taking too long for your table to be served.Now why was there a long queue? I can only speculate that this is a resto famous during its prime, and still attracts a lot of senior residents who reminisce of the old days. Or, like me, was fooled by a recommendation in a blog. And indeed there are a lot of senior residents despite the air-conditioner being broken and it’s a bit stuffy. Yet many families are still queueing outside, mostly with at least 1 senior. I wonder when I’m in my senior years will I be at this resto again

I used to go to this place for dim sum a lot at least 10 years back. Have been thinking of a place to bring my oversea friend and suddenly remember this traditional dim sum place with push cart. When I reached, i got a shock as this place is totally packed but must say the turnaround time is quite fast. The food is as good or maybe even better than what I remembered. I think it should stay as the one most popular place for dim sum. My friend definitely enjoyed the very busy atmosphere and didnt feel out of place being the only ang moh there. He even went to the push cart and ordered a har kow and auntie bring it to him 
5
Came here for a recent business dinner and surprised how good the food was. A bit tricky to find amidst the housing units but really tasty veggie options (clay pot yams, fried bean curd, red bean pancake dessert). All very good and we had the place to ourselves until a large group came in. One of the biggest restaurants I've seen in SG. Not fancy and don't expect much based on appearance but very yummy and would return. Went for dim sum but not served after lunch so will have to try another time
4
Was a very lively place inside the restaurant and a very large gap between the outside quite atmosphere which shows one of those hidden popular location spots without any special signboard or to locate on the street level (located on the 7th floor). Very efficient way of serving by trolleys with each carrying different dishes and courses. Each trolley circulating between table and table and choosing the dish which each prefers. One of the server was considerate to change from the cold plate inside the trolley to a hot one by bringing from the kitchen. Taste was simple and folksy with good taste

My husband and I recently read a food write up on some of the nostalgic places to eat in Singapore. This restaurant was one of them. Not one to say no to dim sum, we decided to give it a try last Sunday and we were not disappointed. We took the har kau, lu sar bao, spring rolls, century egg porridge, beef offal soup, egg tarts and pan fried radish cake. They were all very good. My husband likes eating chicken feet (admittedly an acquired taste for most) and he says it was also very good. Even the pickled cabbage that they served as a starter was tasty. Dim sum ends at 3pm daily and we arrived at 2pm to a queue. It moved rather quickly because most people were already leaving. The dining area is huge and the dim sum is served the traditional way - on trolleys but because the place is big, people were crowding around the trolleys to get their food. Luckily we decided to go with the crowd othwerwise I think we wouldn't have gotten any food! You just hold on to your yellow card that's on your table and head for a trolley! That said, it's best to arrive early as most of the dim sum items had already run out by the time we got there. We had to specifically place our order for some of the items and thankfully they were helpful enough to inform the kitchen staff to cook it for us. We'll definitely be back again soon to try the rest of the items that we missed. A definite must go
3
If you are not prepared to queue this is not the place. A no. is given and you treasure hunt for your table. There are more patrons than food carts so hunt yes hunt for your favourite dim sum cart and a chop will be noted on your items taken.The century egg congee was good as it has been boiled for hours. The siew mai and the stewed chicken feet was flavorful. Carrot cake was slightly fried and the infamous roasted pork was sold out by 1pm. The other dim sum items need improvement as it is mediocre.It is nice to see ardent support of elderly industrious servers here who work tirelessly to help patrons satisfy their dim sum cravings

Quick lunch / genuine Chineese dim sum in Sing
No luxury but excellent food ... Chinese fast food ...
Good variety of dim sum that are served on a trolley which make it easy to choose your food.
3
Food was good enough, service and ambiance were typical standard Chinese. Neither bad nor remarkable.
3
Recommended if you wish to have dim sum and hang out with friends or family in the fun environment. Food is alright, We like the fried banana prawn. It was served by aunties pushing cart with alot dim sum on it. The place is large, if you can not wait till auntie push a cart to your table, you might need to go and get dim sum from aunties yourself. The restaurant is at Chinatown, we walked around that area after food. Its was nice to see local stuffs.
3
I ate at Red Star recently after a lapse of ten years or more. We were seated at a table next to the entrance, just the two of us. The food carts were long in coming; somehow we felt ignored! While the quality of the dim sum was okay and the price reasonable, we did not eat much because we waited and waited..
5
This place still does the push carts around the restaurant. We were able to make a reservation, which was great, else no idea how long you'd have to wait for to get a table. Plenty of variety, quality of food is amazing, a must-do when in Singapore
3
Some of the dim sum are not as good as it used to be. The century egg porridge is expensive and not as nice. You can still order the rest like char siew buns, roast duck meat and dessert. Overall for the 4 of us we spent around $200 so it's really quite expensive. The ordering system works like mâché where you will bring a card to the respective ordering zone to get your card stamped (traditional way) and after you have finished eating you can bring your card to the cashier for payment. That is when you will get a shock. Overall the environment is still very retro and old school with workers pushing their trolleys for you to order. But it's standard has dropped
4
I have had excellent, snooty and pretty dim sum in Hong Kong and Singapore, but the real deal full dim sum experience goes back to the traditional room full of people cart pushing can't stop eatin' dim sum at Red Star. You never would find on your own, but every Taxi driver knows where Red Star is. It looks like a middle to lower middle condominium complex, but the top floor (by elevator) is the ball room full of goodness you are lookin' for
4
Over the years been (since 2001), I've visiting this restaurant for group lunches. In a time where hipsters cafes & restaurants around the world are looking & feeling the same, Red Star's circa 70s interior & aesthetics is unique & is a worth visit for that alone.The fare is a no frills traditional dim sum which for me is fantastic, reminds me of childhood. For fancy top chef, foie gras or truffle on type of modern fusion dim sum (?), look elsewhere.But for a unique experience & trusty old school dim sum menu - Red Star is a winner
3
This is one of the older Dim sum restaurant in Singapore. The decoration is certainly a 70's theme - dark, deep red carpet and chairs and gold colours wall trimmings. I think they still do weddings here. A must visit before such restaurants become history and replaced by the newer and swanky Crystals Jades and Imperial. They serve Dim sum the traditional way - in a trolley. A unique Dim sum experience in Singapore but this would be more common in Hong Kong. The food was not excellent. Siew mai was not succulent, glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leave was just so so. Porridge and the steam rice vermicelli was good. About $40 for 2 persons for lunch.Its located in a HDB block. Parking is easy. If you don't drive - cab is easier. Nearest MRT is Chinatown - you have to mark towards Chin Swee Road (5 - 10 min walk if know how to weave your way through the HDB blocks)The experience was worth the trip. Should visit before it disappears forever
2
I'm a dim sum lover.After read mixing reviews about this place in different websites I decided to try it out. All staff were very friendly, variety of foods and desserts BUT all of them were bad.. Did not pass my lowest expectation at all... Oh well once time visit is more than enoug
3
if you first open up you should have a full menu not a paragraph. Also price is totally different online than on the menu.food is very little on your paint.
4
This restaurant is located on the 7th floor! Best to go during the weekdays as it can get really busy on the weekends and there are no reservations! I love my dim sum and just can't get enough of them! The phoenix claws are so soft and tender

Red Star Restaurant is probably the most authentic, classic looking Chinese restaurant left in Singapore. It practically looks like you’ve stepped back in time to the 1970s.Masterchefs Sin Leong, and Hooi Kok Wai, two of the remaining members of the multi-award winning Four Heavenly Kings of Cantonese Cuisine and disciples of Chef Luo Chen at The Cathay Restaurant in the 50s, continue this legacy. You might not have heard of them, but the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantonese Cuisine are largely credited for inventing our signature Singaporean dishes like Chili crab, Yam Ring and Yu Sheng. Due respect has to be paid for creating such fabulous dishes we love today.Red Star Restaurant’s layout and recipes have remained much unchanged since the 70s for more than 40 years, giving a very deep impression of nostalgia. Their classic metal chairs with red velvet cushions, carpeted floor and large wooden tables covered by a table cloth. Queue might seem quite long to get in, but I actually took about 15 minutes to queue only. Red Star doesn’t accept reservations, so do come early to beat the queue.Red Star restaurant also employs traditional cart-pushing dim sum ladies like in Hong Kong. There are around 8-10 different trolleys all stocking different items, so you might have to hunt down specific trolleys especially when it’s crowded
4
This is the second time in last one year we visited this restaurant. It was a novel experience to see how hundreds of customers are being served with close to 100 different type of dishes on constantly moving trollies. Every dish was nicely prepared. We had about a dozen different types of cuisine namely, Bananas with Prawn, Paper raped Chicken (soft & delicious), Spring rolls, Ha-Kau (i.e. shrimp dumplings), Chicken Feet, Prawn Rice Roll, Chinese Chives roll, Steamed fish head (ginger and black pepper) sugar cane prawn (very tasty) etc. All the dishes were served fresh and hot
3
This place was introduced in "Surprising Singapore" book, so we purposely went for a try. We would say there's nothing significant comparing to our local famous Dim Sum restaurant but if this your first try of Dim Sum then can give a shot. We didn't order much as we are having lunch soon but what surprised us was the way the waitress mumbled a comment of "then I don't know what you guys can eat" in Chinese dialect was a bit blunt. Partly because the variety Dim Sum was not really introduce properly which left us clueless on what to order
3
This is a nice place for people born in the 70s to reminisce the days when I was just about 10 years old. They still have the push carts serving the different varities of dim sum. I've tasted better dim sum so for me is really the atmosphere and ambience that I enjoy. Plus, the servers are mainly older folks so do be patient with them. A tad too expensive for my liking. Be prepared to queue on weekends
3
Each time when I am in Singapore I go to the Red star restaurant with my Singaporean friends This time I went there for an early breakfast. As it is still busy and no reservation can be made go early.By years the quality became lesser. We ordered a number of classic dim sum dishes, the amount of expected stuffing was poor and the ingredients were not fresh. So price/quality is poor.Red star is still an authentic and nostalgia dim sum Restaurant but I think it lost much of it famous and well-known qualit
2
Red Star is an institution started by the 4 heavenly kings (4 top chefs) Their early claim to fame was the invention of yu sheng and yam ring. The restaurant is one of the last few Chinese restaurants that is located in an housing estate with old school decor and service. Think of a big hall with tables, a small stage (meant for wedding yum sengs), metal leg chairs and peach color table cloths.It is probably most renowned for its old style dim sum, very reminiscent of an old Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. You get waitresses pushing carts laden with food moving from table to table, peddling their wares to diners.We ordered a number of classic dim sum dishes such as har gao, siew mai, steamed pork ribs and braised chicken feet. The taste of the dishes were passable but lack finess. In my opinion, ingredients were not fresh. This is especially true for the steamed pork ribs which tasted of frozen meat and has a strong porky taste. Definitely not using Indonesian pork.The other dishes such as Xiao Long Bao has a generous stuffing of pork yet completely devoid of soup which is a must in Xiao Long Bao. As we went on a weekday morning, there were not many tables occupied. What's frustrating is the long wait for one cart to even reach our table. The waitresses were more interested in standing by the side staring into space with their carts rather than moving around. In the end, it was faster for us to just walk up to the carts and order what we want.All in all, dining in Red Star is an experience if you have not tried. To say the food is good is probably an overstatement. However, I have to qualify that I have not tasted other dishes on the menu (non Dim Sum dishes) and they could be outstanding. But this is one restaurant that I will visit for dim sum only when nostalgia hits
4
Tried going to this restaurant but was overcrowded and decided to go on weekday instead.Steam pork rib is tasty, siew mai is meaty and gd. Liu sa pau is piping hot but I find the salty not rich enough but is better than many restaurant. Oh yes, I find the steam chicken tasted like those kampong chicken steam to perfection. Carrot cake is flavoured with chinese sausage fillings and yummy! I personally feels that the chee cheong fan with scallop is abit bland and the char siew pau fillings is not meaty enough and is disappointing as I feel that these are the must have for tim sum. Overall, I would rate the food as very good for the price and portion they served and no wonder is always very full on weekends
4
A traditional Chinese restaurant tucked away in a corner of Singapore not really known for eateries (and on the 7th floor of an HDB building, no less), Red Star serves up great food, old-school style. Come for the gaudy, chintzy 70s decor and stay for the great non-nonsense food, particularly sumptuous dim sums. Try the stuffed chilis - yum
4
This is a great dim sum restaurant. Service slick and fast. Carts laden with delicious bites. Ate way too much..was stuffed full and enjoyed every single mouthful.
4
easy to locate. food was good too, staffs were very pleasant and have a good knowledge of food items.
4
If you like Tim Sum in Singapore, I will recommending this restaurant ! This price with GST(7% Tax) is less then S$70 (include tea for 4 persons). Total about 13 items that I had ordered! Some pictures had attached! Very nice Tim sum as the restaurant is quite famous in Singapore with experience chef! The restaurant is located at level 7, not easy to find if you are the tourist! Please try out and you know the difference! Yummy 
4
This is gem of a restaurant that should be an institution in its own right! The feel of the 1960's is there with the decor and the trolleys of food with Cantonese Dialect speaking waiters and waitresses coming to your table is a rare sight anywhere else in Singapore (or elsewhere?). The very name of the restaurant goes back to the days of Mao. The food is classical Cantonese Dim Sum with all the varieties. There are some more modern dishes and some more Singapore than Cantonese dishes. But worth going to see what Dim Sum was like 'in the old days'. Go on a weekend early. Or else there is a very long wait
4
It is a old traditional Cantonese restaurant at the skirt of China-town on the 7/F of a HDB building.The decoration reflects the old practised of Chinese restaurant ways and management found in Singapore and in Hong Kong. It is nice to use the old way to serve the Tsim Sum by pusing the food cart around the patrons. The variety and quality of the food including Tsim Sum, roasted meats, Hong Kong style cuisine are about average, which is not easy to find in Singapore and Hong Kong now. The price in affortable, although it is still a little bit high compared with dining in Hong Kong. The service is of average. Don't expect too high. The Char-siew puff and deep-fat fried soy-bean roll are highly recommonded. The range of the Tsim-sum dishes from SGD 3 to 4 and the pot of tea is 2 per person
1
Extremely rude ladies pushing the food carts. They spent the last 2 minutes chatting about what to do after work, while I was standing there patiently, waiting for them to end the conversation. When I saw that they were not going to stop soon, I interrupted them as politely as I could and asked if I can be served a portion of the food, she told me to wait till she finishes her conversation. Food wise, there is nothing fantastic either. Interior decor would have been great 4 decades ago but even then, the musty smell from the carpet and chairs suggests that this place needs a major overhaul
5
The thing I like about this restaurant is it's way of keeping traditional practise and cooking method irregardless of how the outside world is changing, the way it sticks to it's way of having their waitresses going around it's diner with push cart serving various kind of "tim sum" during its breakfast hour.The serving of each share is generously prepared and cooked in it's original way just like old days in Singapore, although its location is a little out of the way for most but if you know the area well enough you can actually visit our infamous Chinatown within 20 mins walking distance or hop onto a bus & reach Orchard Road our shopping district area within 15-20 mins as well.Hope that more of such restaurant can be preserve so that Singapore will not lost its uniqueness of a multi racial country.
3
Was introduced to this by my father-in-law who used to live near china-town. Most patrons are of the middle age and probably staying or had stayed nearby. Best to place reservation because it can get quite crowded over the weekend. Try to book early timeslot.Food is nice and reasonably priced. Food is near to Cantonese style. Their roasted duck dish is nice. There is also roasted pigeon. They allow booking for birthday celebrations and clan dinners. Patrons are allowed to go on stage to sing on such occasions and this can become noisy at times
4
The conventional wisdom is that where the locals go, the food is consistent and good. We were therefore more than happy to be treated to a Sunday morning 'brunch' in this traditional Chinese restaurant by our Singaporean hosts, and to wait for a few minutes in a longish but efficiently managed queue; the restaurant was already filled to capacity by a few hundred earlier birds. For those who enjoy different tastes, like we do, this was as good an introduction to traditional Chinese fare as could be hoped for. As the only Westerners in the large room, I felt highly privileged to have been introduced to this place. A more adequate and affordable introduction is hardly imaginable. An experience to be recommended
4
Having heard about Red Star Chinese Restaurant for a while, I was yearning to try it as I love Chinese Dimsum (Cantonese-style food of light snacks or individual portions of food served in steamer baskets or small plates). Red Star Chinese Restaurant is located at Blk 54 Chin Swee Road #07-23 Singapore 160054 and the number to dial is 6532 5266. Yes, its in a HDB block of flats, just in case you are wondering.So, that day when Katherine* suggested we go there for Ken's* birthday lunch, I immediately agreed. This age-old, authentic dimsum restaurant was always filled with patrons, but I was prepared to wait. Fortunately, that day there wasn't any queue.The restaurant's decor is atypical of a traditional Hong Kong Chinese restaurant - red metal-cushy chairs, large round tables covered with white tablecloth, and patterned red carpeting. It provided a very cosy and heartwarming environment.The amicable wait staff pushed went around tables with their carts of dimsum - a first time for me as opposed to the usual manual order-taking. We were hungry, so it was not hard for us to choose from the hot plates of delicacies on the metal racks.The first dish we had was the Char Siew Sou (minced meat puff pastry), a buttery, fluffy pastry filled with sweet red pork minced meat. These triangular pastries came with hints of crispiness, especially around the corners, which made them immensely tasty.Their famous Egg Tart - baked fresh so it was piping hot from the oven, filled with eggy, fragrant, soft custard atop a soft, tart-like pastry crust.Then we had the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) - delicious, fresh and juicy shrimps wrapped in paperthin skins and steamed to perfection. And Braised Chicken Feet - tender chicken feet with almost crispy skin, braised in a salted-sweet sauce that was very lovely.We also had the Xiao Long Baos (tiny steamed buns containing minced meat and hot soup) - a delicious squirt of soup into the mouth is always delightful.Next, the mini pieces of Pork Ribs - softly cooked in a sumptuous gravy.

I really dont understand why this restaurant so many people eat here ...the food is really bad...and the chinese tea got no taste i order 香片..the dim and and the vege is cold one ...the is the worse dim sum i ever eat
20/100 points
5
Was introduced to this place by my local friend. It serves dim sum in push cart and you just pick those that you like. The dim sum were delicious and the place was very authentic dim sum house.
1
The only thing I like was the ambience and the waitresses. The food is horrible, the queue is horrible, the location is horrible. I went there 3 times because of my aunt, and their standard were kept horrible all 3 times.
2
Disappointing though suppose to be the cart driven dim sum. food is oily, place is rundown and feels unhygienic.
4
We arrived at 12:00 for Sunday Dim Sum breakfast and the line was quite long. But since the restaurant is pretty huge it only took like 15 minutes until we were seated.Yes, it wasn't the best Dim Sum I ever had - but it wasn't bad. But what makes this place special is the atmosphere, the waiters. And since there're so many locals the food can't be that bad as others write.It's a classic, and classics sometimes aren't the best. But definitely worth a visit
2
After my last visit, I vowed never to return. Even if the pull factor of having dim sum served on push trolley is good, I would have to say no.Ambience is purely retro and no frills. That is expected. Ditto the old staff and the pace they work.My grievance is the rather pricey food they serve now - more so for a simple joint like this. They have increased prices quite substantially over the past few years.The current pricing deters many from returning. They are comparable to 5 star restaurants.Service is slow and one must be patient
4
Indeed, I was pretty reluctant to go back there for our regular dose of Chinese dim sum and thank God, we decided to head there anyway.The dim sum has actually improved! We were there on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and maybe for the fact that it was a Thursday, the place seems I be understaff. I had to go chasing after carts throughout the meal. But really, thumbs up on the improvement in the taste of the dim sum. Value for money dim sum with a nostalgic ambience:
4
Red Star has been around for many years and my family has patronized this place many times. The places opens as early as 7am and it has a good spread of Dim Sums. We especially like the durian pancake, salted yolk bun, lotus wrapped glutinous rice and the Egg Tarts. The quality of the food has been fairly consistent over the years. However, do note that the push carts will take their time doing their rounds and many patrons will "flock" to the push carts to pick up the items rather than wait till they come by. If you wish to beat the brunch crowd on weekends, come before 10am
1
By 8am on a Sunday morning you would think that dim sum was in full flow. No chance. One trolley - yes, only one - being trundled about in a desultory way. The food on it was so overlooked that it might as well have been there from the day before. We were told that a 'different team' did the fried dim sum, and that they we'd not working yet. It was awful, awful, awful. Which is such a shame, because it used to be cheerful and good. It isn't now. Avoid
3
we like visiting this restaurant because it opens really early. You order your hot tea, it comes with an extra bowl of hot water to rinse the china tea cups. We like the porridge, the hoi sien juan which is minced pork rolled in steamed bean curd skin. We also like the Chee Cheong Fun (rice rolls) with light sauce, siew mai, steamed cha siew buns.The steam prawn dumplings were not too good though. the steamed custard bun with melted egg yolk within, used to taste really good. But I guessed after they had a change of cook/chefs?, the steamed custard bun tasted differently and we decided never to order this again.Service is slack perhaps that is why this restaurant charges 15 percent for services and taxes, rather than the usual 17 percent
3
food as expected. place can get very crowded. not all the kind of food is served every day.
very noisely
4
The different kind of dim sums and large choice of dishes from the menu is great too, tends to be busy and crowded during buffet hours, will be ideal to taste a little of everything
3
almost everything tradition, cart pushing around, waiter & waiteress are very friendly. it just like hongkong style except noise level... hehehe! worth to spent half of the day there rest and relax with family
3
If you are like me, a Hong Konger living in Sinagpore who need to satisfy his craving for Hong Kong style push cart dim sum early in the morning ( I mean like 7am), Red Star is your choice, or may be the only choice!The quality of dim sum may not the the best in town, but some of the items are quite nice. It is the environment that brings me back again to Red Star. It makes me feel right at home with the chattering of Cantonese around me. Early in the morning it is rather quiet, but from about 9am over weekends, it would start getting busy. When it gets busy it is worthwhile to go hunt after the carts and get whatever dim sum you want. That's what I do as a child living in Hong Kong going yum cha with my parents. The best items for me is the steamed rice in a ceramic bowl which is not available in push carts, you have to order it through the waiters. Try steamed rice with salted fish and pork patty, or steamed rice with minced beef patty and a raw egg.Amidst the modern 'tick what you want on a dim sum chit' restaurants, Red Star kept the old dining heritage which is slowly disappearing. It is a special place to bring children to especially!

I went there with my parents on a Saturday morning.There was no queue which was amazing considering it's always so crowded. We were seated somewhere in the middle which we thought was good. Strategic locations to catch the food carts we thought.We waited so long for the food carts to come. I would say 90% of our food were self service. I had to go after the food carts as they seem to be stuck elsewhere. Other people had to go after the food carts too. The dim sum could not be replenished in time.During payment, I asked for the service charged to be waived as I did most of the servicing myself. The cashier just shrugged her shoulder and said "company policy, must pay". She also gave a very nonchalant facial expression. No smiles, no apologies, no nothing.This will be my last time here

This place is hidden on the 7th floor of the apartment building, so you have to know about it, but boy was it good! The staff was very helpful when we were trying to decide what to order. We were the only non-Chinese people in the house and it was a very authentic experience. It can get crowded, so going for a late Dim Sum lunch is a good idea-- there were plenty of tables available when we went in

We asked at our hotel for a good dim sum place and red star was recommended to us because on the Internet site it advertised dim sum dinner as well as lunch.However, when we arrived, we were very bluntly, rudely told 'no, not dim sum' . When we tried to explain the reason we expected this menu the unfriendly maitre just walked off, leaving us with 2 grubby, tattered a la carte menus. We just walked out and wandered around to the people's plaza instead.....if you can't find the food you are looking for there....it hasn't been invented.I hope this review stops any others having similar experiences

You have to know where to go to find this great restaurant close to Singapore's Chinatown. Take the elevator to the 7th floor, and a traditional and exiting restaurant appears. We were very lucky to have our local friends recommend this, and guide us through the dining experience. The staff was pushing trolleys with different dishes around, and everybody piled around them. Just pick what you want, or wait until the trolley comes to your table. Try the jasmin tea! Very good food and a great experience

Was here for luch with my colleague and sad to say that the standard of the food and services had dropped since my last visit.The service was slow and was astonished to hear the captain complained:"everyone was calling and calling" when i called for her and heard her complaining under her voice. This is simply unexceptable, espacially from a captain. She needs to understand that the calling was due to the slow service or the absence of it. I am been very fair here as the restaurant is not even one-third full as we were here for a weekday lunch. The dishes were cold when they come and the porridge was even worse than the ones i had at hawker centre as it was thin, watery and cold. I guess i will not be visiting this place again and its sad as i was here since my school days. The atmosphere is good though, typical classic chinese restaurant settings. But its stil a restaurant and thus, the food and service must be good too

Very shiok dimsum. The staff will push a cute trolley around and you can select a wide variety of dimsum when the trolley reaches your table. Eat scallop rice roll, very delicious! The rest of the dimsum I tried were quite normal meaty ones to me. For durian lovers, must try durian puff. Extremely cold and thick durian, a definite fulfilling dessert to end the day. Usually crowded and noisy. Bookings recommended

This restaurant was recommend by our taxi driver, and is found just before China Town, on the top level of a car park building. The food was very good and plenty of it, service good.
4
Wonderful dim sum in a traditional Singaporean setting. Often crowded with a primarily Asian clientele so you know its good.
4
The wait staff are elderly. Food is still served on trolleys pushed around the cavernous gaudily decorated hall typical of a Chinese restaurant in the 70s. The food is great though and this is old school Cantonese dim sum. Well worth it.
4
If you want the Dim Sum the old and great traditional way Red Star is Ã  great place for you. It has been around fir 45 plus years and never changed. The location feels strange but the restaurant is everything you can expect from a genuine Chinese restaurant. You will meet local people and the food experience is something out of the ordinary. Go to Red Star and you will meet some authentic Singapore, there are so few lef

Carrot cake. Lotus-leaf wrapped sticky rice. All their dimsum, don't even ask what's in it, just grab and eat (unless you're not a meat eater). The scallops wrapped and steamed in a single, giant rice noodle. Really solid fare for Sunday brunch.A word of advice. Don't wait for the trolleys to come to you if the room is crowded. Ambush the trolley ladies as they emerge from the kitchen, and rape them of their steambaskets. Otherwise, expect to be sitting there for a long time with no food.The bill was 90 SINGAPORE Dollars, for 4 people

I used to go this place quite often with my grand ma. I always love the Century Egg Porrige, Char siew and Carrot Cake which my grand ma used to order whenever we visit Red Star.Recently, after a long over due, I had a chance to enjoy my oldtime favourites. The taste was still the same as I tried when I was young with my grand ma. Still the best Century Egg Porrige and one of the best Carrot Cakes.Service was good.Only the difference was, less crowded than previously used to be

We arrived around 10 am on a Sunday morning and was surprised to find the restaurant in an HDB complex. And an even bigger surprise was the jampacked large dining hall with a line of people waiting for table. Fortunately, the lines moved fairly quickly and we were settled for our dimsum fest. As the place the full, the pushcart ladies were always stopped midway and we had to go meet the ladies to get the dimsum we wanted.The dimsum was good, not exceptional. We tried as many of the dishes as we can. They have a few gems worth going for. I liked their charsiew pao and the sesame balls. The beef balls (which you have to order) was also good. Their cold cuts were quite good (also quite expensive relative to the dimsum they served. All in all a good dimsum that maintained the old style (HK) style dimsum
4
Come for the rambunctious, rowdy atmosphere and the push-cart trolley-loads of freshly made dim sum.I loved the food and the 70s vibe. The pushcart trolley ladies know their stuff and will persuade you to load on the delights.However, given the heartland location of this restaurant, I was quite taken aback by the bill at the end of my feasting. Still, it's not astronomical. Coming back for seconds
3
I was taken to Red Star by a local business colleague and was looking forward to some great dim sum. I thought the 70's style dining room might be a sign of a hidden secret but sadly the experience was not great. The food whilst OK, was of average quality and didn't seem to have a level of freshness and was often not served hot enough. The service was acceptable and efficient but is simply about getting people through a meal and getting another group on the table
4
This old-world dim-sum restaurant is always crowded. Coming here, you feel like you are transported back to the 1980s. You need to take a small old lift in a unrenovated housing estate, get your queue number and wait your turn in a restaurant that doesn't seem to have been renovated for more than a decade. So go early if you don't like to wait. Here, waitresses still push carts of dim sum around tables and you order from them, much like how it was done in the past, or in Hong Kong.Food-wise, it's not bad at all, by Singaporean dim sum standard. We loved the carrot cake, cha siu bun and porridge
4
A place from the old days, still very much crowded, nowhere like this in Singapore.
4
The food is average, but you can't beat the old fashioned feel of push cart dim sum! Also, the hustle and bustle of the place adds to the fun. Price is reasonable too.
4
Decent dim sum but you have to personally walk to the push cart with your favourite dim sum to get what you want during peak hours.
2
Over rated. More for the atmosphere. The food is coffeeshop standard at best. More likely for people with no tastebuds.
4
I walked past the Red Star at Chin Swee for years and only tried it for the first time this month. It was a return to my 60s childhood. The decor. The service model. A little off the beaten path, but close to Clarke Quay, visitors should try it for a taste of tradition In between shopping sessions. Honest food. Glad I found it

Red Star is something of an institution in Singapore. The restaurant is situated in an HDB block close to Clarke Quay and it is one of the few places where they still use pushcarts to serve dim sum. The place is pretty run down, the bathrooms need a refurbishment and you can have better dim sum elsewhere (e.g. Crystal Jade Golden Palace and Royal China at Raffles). So why on Earth should you visit Red Star? Simply because it is a nostalgic trip back to times long gone and it makes you feel like you are in Hong Kong. Every visitor to Singapore we bring here loves this place despite admitting that food was better elsewhere. It is also pretty affordable
4
The restaurant is located in a hdb block, but located near the traditional chinatown. Food is above average and shrimps in the dim sum were fresh. Not really delicate dim sum but I seriously think that it's above average. The attraction here is its nostalgic feel and the wonderful atmosphere when the restaurant is full every weekend. Price is reasonable. Do go early as the q is very long over the weekend. Reservation cannot be done here during the morning and afternoon dim sum rush

If you are interested in very authentic, traditional Dim Sum, I urge you to visit Red Star. It is the real deal. We were looking for a restaurant that served traditional dim sum including service from trolleys to show our visiting daughters who had never been to Asia. We checked out Red Star on our own in November and found it to be just what we were looking for. The restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center in Chinatown. It was full during a weekday lunch with no tourists in site other than my wife and me. All the other diners were local chinese, another good sign. We received a friendly greeting and were promptly seated. The servers were quite friendly and accomodating when they realized we didn't speak Chinese or understand all the items on the cart. Everything we selected was very good, the ingredients fresh and well prepared. Compared to some of the more trendy dim sum restaurants in town (which are also good in their own way) Red Star was very good value. We retruned in December with our daughters, also for a weekday lunchand our experience was equally good, maybe better because we tried more things given more people.The restaurant is very clean although it could do with some redecorating. We were told it is very crowded on the weekends and there is usually a wait for a table, but the trade off is that they have a much greater variety of choices on Saturdays and Sundays.If you are looking for novelle, gourmet style dim sum, you will probably prefer other restaurants. If, however you are looking for good traditional style dim sum (and oter authentic Chinese food, we think you will enjoy Red Star. It certainly fit the bill for what we were looking for on these occaisions and we look forward to returning

A popular Dim Sum Restaurant in Singapore that people waited outside the restaurant as early as 5 am in the morning just to get a seat inside. I think it is over rated as the food seems to have lose the taste when I tried them like 8 years ago. But try it if you want a feel of Singapore Kiasu-nes
4
Great variety of tim sum and local dishes like zhu jiao chu (pig trotters in vinegar). Love the deep fried stuff. Push carts, olden Chinese decor, located in an actual HDB flat. Must-visit for tourists and locals alike! Makes me feel like going tomorrow for lunch. haha.. Try to reach early though! Long queues from around 11am onwards.
3
one of the very few traditional dim sum BF places left in Singapore, long queue after 10am on Sundays
4
One of the authentic Dim Sum restaurant, I believe.
3
must try wu gok... the rest, average but still extremely value for $$$
5
yummy yummy!
4
Push cart tim sum
3
Ok ba. They say the egg tart is nice. I would give it a 3 star though i not particularly impress by it.
4
Red Star is not exactly a poshe Chinese restaurant as one would expect. In fact, its main target are local market, which makes its product very value for money as compare to the Tim Sum of other restaurants.such as Crystal Jade or Imperior Treasure with similar quality. One advice though, if you want to go for Red Star during the weekend, make sure you are there before 9:30AM, because the queue is long after that.
1
Stay away from this place.There's nothing redeeming about it at all save for their use of cute nostalgic push carts.The tim sum is terrible and the service is non existent.There are far better places to go to in Singapore for good tim sum.Red star used to be good, but unfortunately, it's definitely below average now
4
This restaurant is located in chinatown, a place full of history. Inside the restaurant, its spacious and roomy. However, do take note that during the weekends, the Q is extremely long for the morning breakfast session. They still have the traditional ah ma pushing the Dim Sum carts around. One drawback is that it may take some time for the auntie to reach your table. Anyway, the dim sum offerred is pretty traditional. They have some new items as well. Taste wise, not too bad, maybe a 7/10. Though the restaurant looks old inside, i still like the ambience there. It really depends on what you like. To me, its like travelling down memory lane, where my family used to head out for Dim Sum early sunday morning every week and those were the days:) As of the service, cannot expect much due to the large crowd during the weekends.Overall, i would say at least, you should try this place once
2
For a Dim Sum restaurant that has a long established 'reputation' this place was very dissapointing.The quality of the dim sum was of a very low standard with limited selection - and this was first thing in the morning at breakfast time.S $25.00 for a few bits of poor quality dim sum and stewed tea is a waste of money.I would not eat here again
2
sadly, not as gd as it used to be. but there's still a Q like b4. find tat the dim sim ain't as nice n is prettt oily actually
3
Old-fashioned restaurant for dim sum served in trolleys.

My Favourite Dim Sum !!
4
Nice dim sum but always so crowded during chinese new year.
5
Classic place for dimsum!
4
Above average dim sum
5
My favorite Dim Sum Restaurant :-)
Maybe becos we usually arrived early at 7am on weekends. So not many people; mainly old folks.
Har-kau; siew-mai; cheong fun (with char siew fillings) and lastly egg-tarts are MUST -TRY. The other dishes are just as good.
2
Prices are resonable but it is not worth the effort and crowd. Overrated IMO.
3
Authentic "push trolley "type dimsum, not bad for a sunday brunch gathering, but be prepared to queue for seats
3
good for cheap dim sum.
4
Hard to find such 80's theme restaurants nowadays... long queue on weekends but quite well worth the wait....
3
Nice dim sum in traditional setting.
3
Good place for early morning Yum Cha... Can be crowded at time... Must go early in the morning to get good seats...
4
Value for money restaurant. Their American duck brings back fond memories... They still serve the authentic cold dish. Must try their stir fried frog leg.
3
Not as good as before.
1
one of the worse dim sum i ever had in my entire life.
4
Here's the place to go at 7am for good dim sum...
3
Long queue is a draw-back.
3
the carts are always the draw for me.... and maybe... the egg tarts..... otherwise....
1
Dim sum is not nice ... need to rush for food ... bad!
4
yummy tim sum .affordable too. Feels like dinning in the 70s/80s rest
4
Another favourite. Great for dimsum...not so great for ala carte dinners. Very affordable dimsum items...tasty infact. Love the flaky egg tarts that are ever so popular and run out so fast. Oh, the stir fried vegetables with fish slices is fab. That aside, brings back fond memories of the olden dimsum places...PUSHCARTS!! nostalgic
4
dim sum - tasty..
3
Traditional Dim Sum on pushcart. Not bad.
2
This is one of the rare places in town where dim sum is still served on trolleys. Taste-wise... nothing impressive.
4
Traditional Push Cart Dim Sum. Start from 7am. Great to bring folks, they will love it.
4
my childhood dim sum place... quite nice lar...
5

4
Ala Carte Dim Sum Buffet's worth going for...
3
Ok lor, value for money.
4
Old-style pushcart dimsum but dimsum can be a little on the 'rough' side.
2
For morning dim sum on trolley
3
Really traditional dimsum, down to the middle aged waitresses pushing the carts. Quality is constant but unexceptional.
5
The Best Tim Sum you will ever had in Chinatown ... very traditional type of tim sum
3
Things has very much remain unchanged in the last 30 years for Red Star "Yum Cha" Restaurant, including the waitresses I think! :-p
Good crowd, traditional cantonese style cuisine. Get there early if you want yum cha, place is crowded at 7'ish in the morning.
4
Huge range of authentic old school tea-house tim sum! A bit ex though.
4
Very fresh and reasonable priced dim sum, always long queue on weekend morning. Very traditional push carts service.
3
Good Tim Sum.
3
OLd fashion Canto Resturant. If u want push cart style dim sum, try this. Reasonable price for its gd food. But Long wait, be early..
2
The tim sum are too meaty.. need to wash down with the strongest chinese tea you can find. But if you are looking for old traditional push cart tim sum on a Sunday morning to bring your grandparents.. go before 10am to avoid the queue
4
The place looks very Chinese wedding dinner but the dim sum's real yummy!
3
It's a nice HK ambience.Great variety!
1
Used to be better. The dim sun is not as fine as before.
1
worst dim sum i have ever tried.
3
Traditional is the word, food not as good as before but still ok
3
Food not too bad. But like to go there because of the 70s feel.
4
One of the few places in town to have Tim Sum from 7am - furthermore it is about the only restaurant that is still operating from the early 60s, the 5 famous Cantonese Chefs of Singapore; each has a share in this one. They invented the Raw Fish Salad, a popular dish served only during the Chinese Lunar New Year period
