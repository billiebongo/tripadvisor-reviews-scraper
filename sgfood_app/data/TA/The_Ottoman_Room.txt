Fat Prince and Ottoman Room are modern interpretations of Middle Eastern/Turkish food. It is neither of them but still good. Service is pretty quick, I would expect to see more alternatives on the menu. Prices are above average. Very nice atmosphere.

Excellent food, good products with great flavour. An edgy version of the classic Lebanese.
If you think it's overpriced, you probably don't have the palate for it.
A place with character and identity, good atmosphere and excellent service, a gem in Singapore.

The prices are in no relation to the poor food and the avarage quality of wine & prosecco. Definitely not worth going

The mezze tray here is epic beyond proportions and the wife reckoned was the greatest olives she ever experienced. A great experience that doesn't rape the wallet. Recommended.

Dunno why we choose it but it wasn't our first choice. The staff was over eager we didn't even sit down and were pushed the menu in our faces and told we have to order everything from each section.The drinks where ok but the food was mediocre for the prices asked SGD 33 for 100g sticky pork was a bit over the top especially when we where told we had to order a minimum of 400g. So we settled for some tartar which tasted like canned sun-dried tomato and basil tuna instead of tartar with a light bitter aftertaste. Some 5 slices of 18 dollars roasted pumpkin. When asked why this is special apparently it was roasted for 14 hours. So what ? Still tasted like pumpkin. Then there where other editions of foo where it said caviar and we saw lump fish caviar I think this stuff was around SGD23. Take in mind all this is like finger food sizes.The Beef was ok and the ink potatoes where tasteless. $300 later I still had after taste of this tartar in my mouth and was by no means satisfied. So I guess trying to hard doesn't always reflect in tasty quality food. Save your money for the real middle eastern food you be happier.PS: Some of the plating didn't worked for me eithe

Been to the old Ottoman quite a few times and love the menu. We usually order some starters from the Fat Prince menu too which works fantastic. Great ambience and service. Came back this time, its now Ottomani with a new menu and very strict rules...I am lactose intolerant and can just about tolerate Halloumi cheese (and love it!) but was told I cannot order from the FP menu, no exceptions! The new Ottomani menu is not very middle eastern as compared with FP's menu and honestly I didn't really enjoy the new menu as much and needless to say, the VERY STRICT rules. Not even for dietary needs, nor do they make allowances for returning customers. Afraid I won't be back

This is my second dining experience in the Ottoman Room - the fine dining area that is attached to Fat Prince. The first time I dined there I was impressed both by the modern take on middle eastern fare and attention to details in terms of dishes prepared. However, this restaurant is SORELY LACKING in service that should match its high standard. The food might be fine but the service is low class. For a restaurant that is high-end ($100 SGD a person on average), I would think the service should be on par. It was not. We were a party of 4 people on a Saturday night and towards the end of our meal we were repeatedly pressured to leave because we were apparently the only diners left in the dining area - at 10:30pm. There were other diners towards the front at Fat Prince but that didn't seem to matter. The priority was to clear the room in order to start closing down this section of the restaurant. THIS IS RUDE SERVICE and VERY UNCLASSY. If you aspire to be a sophisticated restaurant, you should have better service towards your customers. I would seriously reconsider ever spending my time or money here again

For an upmarket restaurant a private function room needs to be set aside for party bookings. A large group standing up and drinking until at least 9pm stood less than a metre behind our table. Diners should at least be warned about this when making the booking, particularly as the venue did not try to control the noise level at all. Disappointing as venue decor is very nice. Service was a bit rushed and for middle eastern dishes they should have a little more flavour

Spent a great evening at Ottoman Room.Atmosphere is a definite 'plus' with light exotic decoration.Service is attentive and never hesitates to recommend.Menu is extremely short with only 5 main courses which we all tasted. All of them came out amazing. May be not your typical turkish taste but a lovely mix of flavors.Wine recommendations were not fantastic as we tried some Syrahs that lacked body.Ended the meal with a cup of raki and left happy
