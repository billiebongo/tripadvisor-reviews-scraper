On the night of the light up ceremony in Chinatown, ahead of Chinese New year, we stopped at this tiny place on Temple street after looking at the plates of clients seated outside. We were seated inside, beside the sink, almost in the kitchen, wondering what we had gotten into. Until we got the food. We had the garlic sprout with pork belly, fried vegetable, tempura prawns and rice. Everything was absolutely delicious ! We will certainly go again on our next visit to Chinatown. At $$67, including two beers, it was reasonably price
