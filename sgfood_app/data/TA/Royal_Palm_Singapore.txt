Nice place for a group dinner. We had a team activity of drumming together and then a sit down dinner. The food is very good. Roasted lamb chops and Basa fish preparation was good.

We made lunch reservation of 16 people at Royal Palm OCC. As it had a 1 to 1 Promotion, the place was very crowded. I think they could do better with the line queue for food by having two lines instead of 1, as the queue had snake out too long. The restaurant did well with their Indian cuisine. Their red velvet and carrot cakes is great. The rest of the dishes were just okay - nothing "wow" about it. Service staff were great and attentive in ensuring that empty plates were clear as soon as they spotted them. Overall, not a good idea to come during promotion as it's way to crowded. Thank you, Royal Palm for being the place for our family lunch for the year end

Went there for a 1-for-1 hi-tea buffet. It was amazing and they keep on refilling. Luckily for me I'm not really the seafood lover. They refill like every 10 to 20 minutes for the fresh oyster and was gone in a blink of an eye. Well, the kebab and tandoori is nice. Chilli crab could be better, maybe it's just personal. The pizza there was a bit too crunchy but well, each restaurant has different style. Would recommend to go there once and try it out. Since it's on promotion now, don't wait. The downside would be that the seating capacity is quite limited, so make a reservation instead of walk-in

Dear AllThere has been many set back pertaining to this resturtant . We have no comments on the venue beautiful scenery of boat night life. Great hotels nearby. The staff of royal palm has a poor quality of customer service, Recently my daughter's wedding dinner was held many things went wrong and not cater to our needs and request. Hotel bookings for the couple was not made known of the reservation number. Staffs do have the standard of hospitality to go extra mile to serve customers.To my dismay the coordinator makerting staff doesn't seem to the exposure of arranging wedding events. Wrote to them emails slow responding.There is a lot of room to improve on service standards. Please remember if choose them you have to ensure that your presence are felt to ensure nothing is amiss before the events starts. This what happen to me

We chose royal palm for my sisterâ€™s engagement for its scenic view and classy ball room setting in the restaurant. We did have some hiccups along the way but the function ended up a success. Parking in flyer can be pricey and our event was held during the national day rehearsals leading to several road closures. It was stressful but with proper planning and by pre-amping our guests, everything went fine on the day.Our guests raved about the food quality. It tasted good unlike restaurants where the food tastes good during food tasting on the actual day i have heard many complaints.Setting of the buffet tables, service etc were excellent. End of the day our guests were very contented and so was our family.A very special shoutout to Anandh, manager in Royal Palm. With him around, we were felt more at ease and confident holding the function. Even before we requested for things to be done, he on his own effort ensured that they were done and took effort to ensure that everything went smooth. He was also very patient in explaining and answering all our questions and doubts. A marathon was also held along the restaurant on the evening our function was held but he with his experience assured us that it will be minimal disruption to our event and beared with every question i posed to him. Prior to the function, he sat patiently with us when it came to choosing the center pieces, table cloths, menu etc.Thank You Anandh for a great job done! Excellent customer service from you!Would definitely recommend Royal Palm to those who are looking for a classy venue with beautiful view

There is seating outside so you can enjoy the beautiful view. (You are also allowed to smoke).I was charged $5 for the smallest cup of mint tea. My husband had a large coke which was $5. As usual prices are ++. The thing that surprised me the most was the waiter keeping my change. I did ask for my receipt but never received my change.

The restaurant is located within the premise of Singapore Flyer at the 1st floor #01-02. I attended a grassroot gathering event and had our simple breakfast and sumptuous lunch at a function room at this restaurant. You may wish to consider the cost factor when organizing a event at this restaurant.First, I touched on the parking charges. I parked my car opposite the Singapore Flyer at a multi-storey car park. The parking rate is rather expensive and has been revised to $1.50/- per half hour or part thereof since Jan this year. I parked my car at abut 7.30 am and when the event finished at 12.30 pm, my parking charges came to about $15/-. Fortunately, there was a complimentary parking ticket from the event organizer. As such, it is imperative to check with the restaurant if it includes complimentary car park ticket if you intend to use this venue for your function.Secondly, if you intend to include a Singapore flyer ride for your participants, please enquire also on the cost. It is not cheap and is about $28/- after discount. Each ticket is valued at $33/- so you have to incorporate the cost of the ride into your budget. The plus points for this restaurant is: firstly, it is located within the premise of the Singapore Flyer and command quite a cool and scenic view of Marina Barrage and the Garden By the Bay. The chairs and tables are arranged outside at the open area facing Garden By the Bay and the Marina Barrage, so it has a great ambience and atmosphere for interaction when you take your lunch or breakfast. I found it relieving after a heavy sharing session inside the function room.The staff is very helpful and they are always around to serve you but the chairs outside in the open air was a bit wet probably due to the morning dew. I liked the way they cook the spaghetti and the fish for our buffet lunch. As noon crept in, the hot sunlight flooded the open area and the food for your lunch will be exposed under the hot sun. It should be consumed quickly. It is hot under the sun to consume your lunch at the open area. You should consume them in the function room.The function room is also spacious and well equipped with a stage and a comprehensive communication system.Overall, I have good impression on the cleanliness of the restaurant, the helpfulness of the staff and the good location
