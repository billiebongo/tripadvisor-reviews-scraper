Always get a great burger at Bergs. Two vegetarian options which can easily be made vegan, proper thick cuts chips and not-too-sweet ice lemon tea make any trip to Bergs a good one. Husband confirms that the beef and chicken burgers are good too.

Well cooked well balanced burger.
Excellent sauce combo.
Mountain Goat beers were a great match.
All service came with a smile!
Enjoy your time here.

Yum yum yum!!!!! Would eat here again. Steak sandwich is huge and well worth the price. Staff are pleasant, fast service and free wifi.

Went for lunch after hike on empty stomach.Even then, burger was so average. Patty tasted just like premade frozen patty that was cooked. Thin patty. No sides to accompany either. First thought I had wasthis is like a bl whopper junior, oh wait maybe not even as tasty overall, but for triple the price Ble

I’ve found a few tasty places to eat in Singapore but this was beyond expectations! Two veggie options, I opted for the good falla and despite my initial fear of not using cutlery to eat (no I do not like to use my hands) I found that this was perhaps the best burger I’ve ever ate! Red wine was served cold which again made my heart sink but surprisingly was actually alright (I will however stick to room temperature in future). I will definitely be back

As a family we visited Berg’s at Katong after a Sunday afternoon movie. Our first visit to BergWe ordered fours burgers... the fries, some are hot and some are room temperature (not warm)The patty for the veg burger is not hot... Luke warm suggesting that it wasn’t thawed properlyThe second burger, the bread is cold ...Left with no choice but to cancel the order, I question the service levels and the quality of food offered. A big disappointment ...

The burgers still taste the same thankfully and that's the only reason I still come back here. But over the past few months when I try to call and order so that I can cycle down and pick it up, they NEVER answer the phone. And my residence doesn't fall within the bergs catchment for delivery. So today once again after repeatedly trying them I get here and ask them why they aren't answering their phone. The staff tells me that it's been busy. I'm astonished with this hubris from what is already a gradual drop in service levels as I see fewer wait staff. This is the first time I've come across a restaurant that actively works to turn down. I asked them if this is company policy but they said no and the manager Theo didn't even deign to talk to me. Extremely poor service.

Used to be a monthly stop off here, one of my previously favourite and much advocated burger joints in Singapore. Probably visited 20 times or so.Recent visit though, rather shocking. Service bad. Very slow. Not proactive. No draught beer ... seems to be unavailable. Dodgy grilling, make sure you specify super well done. Beware the special offer for a “burger and beer” but doesn’t specify that you need to have a large burger to qualify for this offer.All those little things add up to a poor experience unfortunately. A place going downhill I’m afraid. Very fast

I love this place. It's fuss-free, laid back and their burgers are simple and nice. I tried the vegetarian falafel burger and my Friend had the beef burger. Mine was slightly dry but full of flavour and my friends absolutely loved hers. They have beers and wine to Go with the burgers
2
We had quite high expectations, reading some feedback: one of best burger places in East Coast. First of all, staff is not friendly and not attentive. Secondly, the burgers were not tasty, the meat was too dry. I found piece of plastic in my bun! Staff didn't really apologise. We will not recommend this place.
3
tried the basic in order to taste the meat and seasoning. it was pretty average.Ive tasted better. ambience is open and communal. service is fast efficient.
5
Huge fan of Bergs, they are genuinely good burgers and have great options for the kids, as well as Adults. Worth trying the specialist root beers and ginger beers if you are not looking at the micro-brewery options.
4
Nicely plonked in the middle of East Coast road this burger joint is a great place for a casual but delicious burger. Fab fat chips area highlight, there are two amazing veggie options and my carnivorous husband assures me the meaty burgers are good too.
4
Nice place to have peaceful time. Serving good burgers and beer. The quantity is adequate and variety is good.
4
Still one of my favourite burger joints in Singapore. Berg with cheddar cheese cannot fail to disappoint.Great ambience with wooden tables inside and outside and friendly service. Great location right on East Coast Road.Enjoyed the variety of beers here including the pure blonde and my Daughter likes the Jarritos sodas they serve here.The grilling is not as good as it used to be. Sometimes the burgers come out a bit under-cooked in the middle. Nothing that is going to make you ill but I think another minute on the grill would be a whole lot better and get Bergs back to the top of Teh burger joint list in Singapore

We were rather late to the restaurant. It is about 8.40 pm when my pregnant wife has a craving for beef burgers. Reached there and the place closes at 10. My mini berg burger is about 10 bucks and my wife's burger is about 14. Overall spent about 35 inclusive of a drink. It does satisfy the hunger and the beef patty is juicy, but overall it is not as impressive for a late night snack. There are a few couples that came right after us. They complained that the burger does not come automatically with fries (if you top up 5 dollars you get a drink and fries). Will probably give it a miss next time and try other burger joints around there
5
A large group of us dined here one night. We all had very different tastes but there was not a single complaint. The food was amazing we all left very satisfied and full !! would highly recommend this place if you are just craving something western 
2
Food was average. The seasoning for meat patties were not evenly mixed hence some parts of the burger were tasty while others were plain bland. The service was definitely not up to standard. The manager for the night was rude and kept staring at the diners throughout the evening, making the whole experience relatively uncomfortable. In addition, they had a sign that said "daily happy hour 5pm - 9pm". But when we enquired about it at 7pm, they said that they did not have happy hours. Very strange. Overall, the next time i have a burger craving, I would definitely head somewhere else. For example, fat boys just down the road
4
We've been here a number of times for the burgers and they are usually first class. Good size and good value for money. Quality is good and they cook the patty the way you ask them. Menu includes quite a few different types of burgers for those that don't like only beef. I have also bought a take-away from their Far East branch which was also good
3
With great anticipation I walked Bergs which is a short distance from my hotel. The reviews made it out to be that I would have a terrific burger experience. My order arrived without much of a wait. The patty appeared to be machine formed, which is a strong indicator it will not be a great burger. It was not overcooked yet flavor was plain and the texture was too dry for me. My rating for the burger is two and a half at best
4
This place reminded me of the best burgers I had at Ferg Burgers in Queenstown, New Zealand. The quality of the burgers are good and the portion is generous.
5
Stopped by Bergs and was very pleased. They offer a varied selection of burgers that exceeded my expectations.
Will definitely stop in again.
3
We had 2 burgers and fries. The Berg sized burgers are huge. I enjoyed having beetroot and pineapples in mine. Although... The beef patties were disappointingly bland and dry in both burgers.
3
Not much people during my 2 visits here. Burger is big and tasty. I came here yesterday and i noticed the staffs dont seem to enjoy the work. all with expressionless face. Hope they can put up better smile. Burger cost from $10-$20.

Surprised to find this burger gem of a restaurant near Katong area along East Coast road! Tried the Miss Piggy beef burger with crispy bacon strips and find it really good! I selected the small size burger versus the Berg size (normal). To me the small size is already sufficient! For an addition of $5, you get thick cut fries and cup of ice lemon tea! The BBQ sauce provide was good too to go allow with the burger and fries! Very casual ambience and staff are friendly. Apparently they have 3 branches in total. Will be back for sure

This restaurant had better rethink who they hire. I went in, sat down and was greeted by the wait staff. Then she disappeared. I sat there for 10 minutes. The guy behind the counter looked up from his video game and saw I was there and went back to playing his game. The waitress, I soon discovered was sitting with her friend eating. She finally came over. I made the comment that I thought she was a customer. And then she said "Oh that's okay" as if I were apologizing for interrupting her meal. At that point I walked out. Even though this is a chain restaurant people should take a little pride in their work and act with a little integrity. Never going back

Bergs have the best burgers in Singapore ---- by far. They have 3 branches in East Coast, Haji Lane and Amoy in the CBD. The East Coast branch is where I normally go. They have a great menu with different kinds of burgers. "budgie smuggler" Is good (chicken burger) but I normally go with the "berg with cheese". You can choose between normal size and "berg" size which is gigantic. The seating is casual but comfy, staff are really engaged with the concept and do a good job. But the thing that makes the berg burgers so good is the special sauce. Unknown recipe. The burger comes wrapped up in a grease proof paper and it's really super tasty. At the east coast branch they have pure blonde draft beer which goes very nicely with a "berg with cheese". All in all the best place for your burger fix in Singapore
5
I have been there a few times! And the burger never disappoints. My family and I love their "Miss Piggy" a lot. The beef in there is just amazing. It is extremely juicy and the texture is just right. I never liked veggies but I changed my mind when I had this burger. Not exaggerating but if really that good. There is a wide variety of burgers and you will probably find something that suits you! I went to the Katong outlet and the environment is great.

This is my second time eating Berg's burgers. First was the chicken based burger which I feel is must juicier than the lamb burger I had this time though. Price is slightly on the higher side but it's justifiable given its fresher ingredients compared to those at the fast food restaurants. I do hope they have pork burgers though.
4
One the way home with a small hunger in my stomach I stopped here, have a seat and ordered a Chicken Burger and a Ginger Bew. The "big" version was not so big how expected and from my opinion to expensive for this size but the taste was good. So I gave 4 stars because it is not bad to ear here.
4
Big westerner size burgers. Think ramly burgers supervised! Burgers are larger than whoppers and freshly prepared. Patty are juicy and succulent. Great for a boys night out
4
There serving was good for any big eaters like me. Try out their all day breakfast menus. I like them all!
1
We dropped into this place after hearing about it.
What an absolute disappointment!
We ordered a beef burger with cheese and a chicken salad.
The tastiest part of the meal was the iced water that we drank.
Not worth it.
3
After seeing some mention of Bergs, I decided to give it a try. Sadly I think their burger is overrated. Nothing to wow about and hardly gourmet in any sense. Give it a good and decide for yourself.
4
This small gourmet burger place in East Coast is a treasure cove. The restaurant decor and ambiance is kept very basic but quality of burgers is great! Once can even find a vegan burger here that tastes amazing.
3
My experience with my partner was great. Basically her presence adds a bonus that night. However, the burger needs a little tweaking for it to be more juicy as it is a little dry. The steak sandwich can be better too. The filling and taste seem to be beef teriyaki rather than a steak sandwich as it has a touch of stir fry to it.Ambience is surprising great for a small place though they do have a second storey that can serve more customers. I am satisfied with the service which was being done by a single waiter and a cook that night. Kudos to the 2 who were very busy that night. The waiter is both friendly and helpful. He comes with a great smile too

As an avid burger/sandwhich lover, good burgers are sometimes hard to come across. Either they're too small, the meat's funny in taste or its too cheezy, or the bread's too sweet. But Berg's burgers are full of honest, fresh and wholesoe flavours. The pricing for the size and quality is excellent. Okay, usually I would never pay $20 SGD for a large burger, who would, but if you saw the size and quality of the burger your jaw would hit the ground. Whether its the fresh lettuce, huge juicy meat patties topped with crispy bacon or the mouth watering variety of sauces, you'd know why you're paying $20. Great burgers. Great service and staff. Definitely a must do in Singapore. Spread over several locations, you'll find one near you wherever you are in Singapore

I often reference 'skimping on the fries' as a metaphor for bad service where service providers skimp on cheap things that cost them very little - but change your experience significantly. I wonder though when did it become ok for a burger places to start charging extra for the fries that make it a meal ? Last night I found two such burger places and thought it ridiculous that they would charge 4 or 5 dollars on top of a $15 burger for a few fries. $15 for a burger and I have to go to the counter and order it myself and no fries ? Now Fatboys (around the corner) is skimpy on the fries, but alt's and Bergs go one better by making you pay for them separately. Berg's is a decent burger - but they go crazy with condiments and there curry ketchup and overpowering aioli will kill your burger if you do not ask for them to leave them out or use them sparingly - or on the side

From the first impression, it looked promising. Their tag is "Gourmet Burgers" and their price (high) hints at it. Got a table, sat down and ordered. Lack of waiter/waitress means i had to work hard to get them to focus on what i'm trying to order, which was simple enough "Berg with cheese and a Steam Ale please". I had to repeat that a twice. Then after all that, i had to choose the cheese. OK. Not her fault. Only one person taking the floor. Clearly a cost saving thing, and it doesn't stop there.Be prepared to wait a while but that's OK. We can wait for good food. Burger finally arrives and it looks good. Took the first bite... hmmm... OK.. took another bite... still hmm. Quarter through the "Berg"er, i needed some ketchup. One guy in glasses begins running around the floor, i assume he's helping out the poor waitress. Doesn't smile, unfriendly and acts like his house just got repo. I asked for ketchup, he drops 2 packet of Heinz ketcups. What? No bottle? No gourmet sauces? Almost finished my burger and i realized my ale wasn't here yet. They (apparently) forgot about it although the system is automated (going by the tablet they use to take orders).The bill came to be 22+$ for a small burger and a draught beer. Let me correct that. It's 22+$ for a pretty lame "Gourmet Berg"er and a beer. The patty was tasteless, cheese wasn't enough and no fries... really?You know when you eat lousy burgers, and the patty always seemed to have some soft of un-chew-able pieces that reminds you of chewing tissue paper? And then you have to spit it out?.. what can i say.. welcome to "Berg Gourmet" burger!You have been warned

Visiting Bergs Gourmet Burgers was a very average experience...- Freshly BBQed beef- High quality buns- Home-made sauce- Special burger creations you can't eat anywhere else......is something you WON'T get at Bergs Gourmet Burgers. Instead they use instant-beef-patties, standard fastfood buns, creating standard burgers you could buy in any random fastfood restaurant for a quarter of the price. I found "Gourmet" only in their name... not in the burgers
3
We were craving something from home and decided to try a burger which was pretty good although not quite the same as a good aussie burger. Worth a visit if you are in the mood for a burger.
5
Best Burgers in town, great service and amazing choice. Definately worth a visit . Will be sure to go back again next visit
2
Their burger is below average. The beef have no taste and not juicy. More like McDonald standards but coffee house prices.
4
Great Burger, no emphasis on fries...its all about the burger.... and a friendly atmosphere and good price
2
This micro eatery is really overpriced: food lacks in taste, portions are small, salads are terrible. They have a large selection of burgers but they're nothing special. At the end of the day you'll remember the bill and not the food.
4
Reasonably priced. Went for the small berg with cheese, drink and chips $16.50. Couldn't finish it. Close to everything on the main road, some seating on the footpath in the shade. Well done.
5
Had a really delicious felafel burger here and also a mountain goat ale on tap. Chips were old style - fat and delicious. Service was a bit slow - think they were understaffed. Good vibe.
4
A nice burger joint amongst a number of other restaurants in Katong - a very wide selection of Beef, Chicken & Lamb burgers and lots of drink options from the standard lemonade/Ice Lemon Tea, to Jarritos bottles and up to draught beer from New Zealand. All served by very friendly staff...Some of the burgers can be a little bit overwhelmed by their sauces but are generally of good quality, well cooked and tasty.If you're a burger fan definitely worth a visit..
3
If you like service and quality food then perhaps you need to look elsewhere. I'll fess up I didn't have a burger I had the salad which was smaller than I was expecting. There is no table service so when travelling along it can be a pain if you are carrying bags. Although in Singapore this is not really a problem. More for those who would like a burger after a few hows in the pubs close by
2
Interesting burgers on offer when you look at the menu but the problem remains that the beef patties are of really poor quality: thin and very dry. I've tried various burgers and the chicken ones seems to be the best for overall flavour. Their signature double patty beef burger is terribly dry and had bacon cooked in the same fat as the burger. I'd love this to be a good local burger place but have given up as there's been no progress since they opened
5
Try their special white sauce and lamb burger. Both together are awesome... So good that you'll start craving for it every day.
4
Small place with a big taste and good beer . I had the berg burger my partner had the steak without bread she said it was great we both had a pint of the blonde beer a very good meal .
5
The burgers here are just right, you can get them rare or medium rare and it is a treat. There is even a vegetarian option, they also have good beer. I loved this place and would go back.
4
we stumbled onto bergs one day. ambience is ok but the burger and sauce were good. patty was moist and of decent size. will come back.
5
Used to frequent this place when they were in Changi Business Park. Yummy burgers, especially their lamb burgers. Ask for their special white sauce. It is truly addictive
2
Bergs is a very popular burger joint but somehow I've managed to get disappointed by my experience there, twice. The first time (Sept 2014) around the Lamb burger was too dry, and the Chicken Cajun a bit bland.I do understand food joints having their off days and so I decided to give it another shot in July 2015, especially since Bergs has such a huge fan following. The 2nd time there, I ordered the Cheeseburger and Chicken Cajun and not only were both bland, lacking in salt and flavour but the breads were stale! I had ordered a takeaway, else I would've definitely sent the stale bread back to the kitchen
3
Bergs continues to be a favorite place of our for high quality burgers. And it the place is definitely a welcome addition to East Coast Road. That said we have found standards dropping a little lately and wonder what that is about. The most recent visit for instance was not a success. The hamburger pattie was soggie (not from not being fried long enough) but perhaps which made the buns really sloppy and unappealing. Oddly the time before that we had one where the pattie was excessively dry and tasteless. Previous times were great... and we are not super fussy types so we might just come back for a couple of times more to see how things go.
4
I like the occasional burger, but it must be a good one. Bergs have a number of outlets in SIngapore, and I have only had good burgers from them. They are served the way burgers are meant to be eaten: by hand. Roll up your sleeves and get stuck in
4
This is not a very cozy restaurant, but have delicious burgers and a good selection of micro brewery beer. Most from Australia.You can choose between to burger sizes and everything is homemade. Even the ketchup. The Burgers are cheaper than the beer!They have good deals where you can top up your order with fries and lemonades for a small amount of money. For us traveling with children they have kids menu, high chairs and even spend some drinks on the children even if they don't eat.Visited this restaurant twice in February and March. Will go here next time in Singapore :-

The cafe is basic ... no issue ... the good is okDecent burger but i am not going to rave about it .. had much better By time fries came burger was 60% gone. Nice fries ... Yes id ho nack before going to the big boys fast food places but i will not be running there soo
