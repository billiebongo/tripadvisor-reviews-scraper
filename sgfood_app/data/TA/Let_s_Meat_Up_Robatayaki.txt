Great place for lunch. Choose your favorite meat with rice or soba. Very tasty. Tasty sweet potato fries or battered mushroom as sides are also a must try.

It's fusion food yet it's great. Burger bun different from normal buns & compliment well with their meat. Fries are the best !
Pricing on certain dish on higher range but worth trying. Coke with sour plum is yummy ðŸ˜‹

We went with our grand daughter and daughter. The food was good and fresh, but at the end of dinner waiter gave each of us a plate of melon. (We did not request) we thought it is part of set dinner, we ate them. Waiter gave the worst piece of melon to our granddaughter. I thought that was weird, any way at th end of dinner they charged S$40 per price of melon. The beef vegetable were expensive but we did not entertain a rib off by tripping us to eat the melon we did not order. If you want to be rip off go to this place. I wish I took the photo. Ever since then we never went back again.

Passed by a few times, was attracted by the food they are offering. Today finally went in for lunch. We tried the wagyu minute steak with rice, pork chop with soba and pork cheese fries. They are all delicious, price at mid range. Will come again to try out their other food

Went for lunch 1.30pm on a Saturday, place was pretty full. Tables are quite near to each other, squeezy layout. After ordering, we request to shift to a corner table because we had a toddler with us and the centre is too cramp. The male Chinese staff initially was reluctant and asked the manager while giving a so troublesome face to us -.- The manager agreed to let us shift there (no reason not to) then the staff reluctantly helped us.Hot green tea ($1.50), hot water refillable. Salad was generously drizzled with creamy sesame dressing, refreshing and tasty. Too heavy on the dressing though. Gyoza isn't like the normal thick ones, this is very thinly deep fried crust until crispy, the meat inside is so little that it is barely tastable. We got 3 mains, 3 proteins with 2 rice and 1 soba. The soba was boring, just boiled and serve. No seasoning no sauce. Rice too came plain and not the Japanese ones, just normal, only the teriyaki chicken's rice had sauce on top. The grilled chicken leg is boneless and cooked well, tender juicy and moist. Salmon too was really really soft! The steak on the other hand was a little tough and dry.Service was pretty good except for that one guy server. Food wise some items great but some still can be improved. All these food costs $71+ which was pretty affordable in town considering we had 3 mains, 3 drinks and 2 sides to share.

A great place for Japanese BBQ lovers as you get all the chargrilled goodness without the smoke and grease. Lots of healthy options too if you're watching your waistline.On my first visit I had the grilled salmon with soba noodles. The salmon was tender and not overcooked. I did not enjoy the soba noodles as much as they were served rather dry without any extra sauce or soup on the side. While I adore soba noodles, i generally prefer them served up the traditional way on ice with a dipping sauce on the side.On my second visit, my friend and I shared the grilled tofu and mushrooms main and another grilled chicken thigh with rice.Both were pretty tasty but the portions were rather petite.A big plus about this place is that it does not get too crazy crowded on weekends. Nice place to grab a relatively healthy bite before hitting one of the cinemas in the area

Came to give this restaurant a try and we did not regret it at all. My kids like the foods here. It is quite fusion but overall is good. Service is ok and can be improved to serve faster. I recommend this place to everyone who is nearby

Interesting fusion dishes. Good flavour but not accommodating to our simple request for unsalted fries. For the price, we'd expect they'd be able to. We always prefer fries without salt cos we already get too much salt from everything else and fries taste better to us without salt. Also, tomatoes properly prepared by cutting out the core is also quite basic. Two simple things that even fast food joints can deliver. Aside from these, dining conditions are a wee bit too cozy so don't expect a romantic dining experience when you're sharing conversations with the next table. On the more important note, flavours are interesting and different. Well worth the trip but not something I'd care to repeat. Well, at least not too often.

I had the Grilled Salmon with Soba. Generous portion for $14.00 for me. There's a choice of Rice if you don't like Soba. Comes with sides of Tofu & Pickled Cucumber. The cucumber was amazingly thin so it's tasty n good. I also ordered the side of Fried Gyoza with Pulled chicken. Very good too. That was my lunch...alot but good n will last me till dinne

Initial, I asked my friend, where should we meet? She replied, Let's meat up! I thought there was typo error on the message and she wants to meet up with me first but ended up the shop name was Let's Meat up! There were a list of meats for you to choose from and together with soba or rice. We had grill salmon with rice and chicken chop with soba. Additional, we ordered cheese fries and sour plum coke. You can request for additional cheese for your cheese fries. The cheese fries comes with 2 slides of meat which were delicious. I am not a coke lover but just simply love their sour plum coke. For dessert, we order sweet potatoes dishes. It's taste soso. Can skip! Try it
