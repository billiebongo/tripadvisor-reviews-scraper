Gorgeous romantic ambience, sublime sumptious spread, and to die for fresh raw oysters! And all this with excellent, attentive service! Will definitely patronise it again! Highly recommended!

AMAZING SERVICE AND AMAZING FOOD! Thankyou to Ganesan for making us feel welcome you were very attentive, Would highly recommend!

This is my first time having dinner at Melt Cafe and it truly resonates quality food. Great variety of cooked food that caters to all different diet. Desserts were unique as it catered to the theme of Chinese New Year.
5
A nice place for dinning. The place was decent for a variety of international foods. Love the seafood section, beef stew, mushroom soup and the desert bar. However the refill for the seafood and dessert bar was not far enough when the crowd gets in. Overall was great!
5
We had breakfast here 10 times during our stay and it was superb every time. Staff are absolutely outstanding as I mentioned in the Mandarin review. Evening Buffet was recommended by Ghurbal in the Melt restaurant. We were a little sceptical however, it was by a country mile the best buffet we have been to and I can recommend to anyone looking for a really god meal and some wonderful seafood and Asian food. Again the mandarin staff, simply outstanding
3
The venue is beautiful and service was good. However, we were not impressed by the selection that was offered. We expected much more for the price we paid
5
I have attended other venues which provides dinner buffets at similar price points and would like to commend Melt for being above and beyond in their service, food quality and variety. Some of the notable things are as follows:First, the temperature in the cafe and outside was perfect that it wasn't too cold or too warm as was the case for many other establishments. It might be a trivial detail but something that I appreciate very much. Second, I didn't manage to get the name of the staff that was helping me at the cheese section. As an ardent lover of cheeses, I found manage to get very good recommendations from this particular female staff and I could see the passion in her while she described the cheeses and the best way to pair and partake in them. Third, clearing and serving of used plates and water was very prompt. Fourth, staff react quickly to diners dropping food items and would cater to many requests that I have observed.There was literally nothing to complain about which is the usual excellence provided by an establishment housed within Mandarin Oriental
5
Service impeccable and the selection of Breakfasts fantastic. You can have a traditional English Breakfast, Chinese, etc amazing way to start the day so if you are staying at the Mandarin Oriental definitely a place to come
5
I met this person he does the greatest service and with courtesy. He enjoys working for people and to serve others.He does not get tired of his job.we liked all the food in this hotel.His behaviour is well mannered and a decent man.He does not get frustrated and always attends to every single customer.we are pleasured to thank him
3
The staffs are very friendly. However, i think it needs more variety, or maybe cause we went on a weekday there’s lesser choices. The japanese section was meh, while the rest was alright. The best part is the seafood section which was very fresh as well as the dessert.
5
Breakfast is to die for! So many choices from all over Asia. You could literally eat your full of the regional delights & not need to eat until dinner. Service is excellent too even when extremely busy & a full hotel. I cannot give a higher amount of praise. This is a wonderful hotel all through
4
Good serving of crabsAnd good service. Just for the bbq area, was slightly cold for the food. Else, it is a good place for seafood dinner
5
Phenomenal breakfast at the Mandarin. Very brought selection with excellent and polite service! Eat outdoor if weather permits!
4
Great variety of food for omnivores and herbivores alike. Eastern and Western food & desserts.One thing though, for a buffet its a pretty queer experience for food to be free-flow yet making it inconvenient to have utensils we need to eat the food.Used utensils were cleared and not replaced until requested for. Utensils set outside the used plates were also cleared. Utensils available to be taken by ourselves are restricted to those meant for the food nearby these - e,g chinese soup spoons near chinese soup. I was not able to find forks. Dear Melt, replace the utensils if these were collected, either that or not collect them after every use, especially when utensils were set aside by customers ok to re-use them for subsequent servings. Or educate customers how to place the used utensils to communicate to the service staff what to do. Pls allow us utensils we need to enjoy ur food from buffet!
5
 Foods were very various and delicious as well. But The most impressive thing was the service! All of staff were very helpful and kind.  Espicially, I am really want to say thank u to Avery who is a Korean staff. I went there for celebrating my wife’s birthday on Dec with my family. At that time, there were a lot of guests. So, a little bit messy. And all of staff looked so busy. But one of staff took care my table did her best. She smiled at us from beginning to end as well. I really want to recommend this restaurant.Thank u so much Avery. I hope to see u again next time:)
5
Never a fan of buffets anywhere .. especially in hotels but this was a joy. Absolutely loved the seafood and Indian offers. My son majored on meat !! As we were staying in the hotel ( excellent ) we even returned for a second night. Many thanks to Alex for encouraging us to eat here (!) and for looking after us. Staff are excellent.
5
I stayed at Mandarin Oriental Hotel for 4 days and i got complementary breakfast at this cafe. Food was nice and delicious.
4
We had our New Year buffet here and the selection was vast. Any person can find something tasty to eat
5
We arrived here Wednesday 3rd January staying for 3 nights.We decided to book Melt Cafe for the evening buffet on Thursday.Firstly we were served by Ganesan and Alex the restaurant assistant manager.Both were superb and a credit to the establishment.We had the buffet dinner at 75 Sgd each.We also had a bottle of Malbec at 140Sgd .The wine and food quality and selection were superb as well as the service.I was slightly disappointed being charged 32 Sgd for 2 x bottles of water when we had spent over 300 Sgd on food and wine. Having eaten at numerous Michelin restaurants over the years I usually expect water to be complimentary.However, this is just constructive criticism from me and I do not want to detract from the excellent food, and more importantly service from both Ganesan and Alex.Well done team and we look forward to seeing you again very soon

This review is long overdue having been to the Melt Café for its dinner buffet in October 2017. The buffet itself was terrific and the service attentive without being overbearing, but the real stars here were the Indian dishes prepared by Chef Santosh Kumar. Having spent over a month traveling around India and eating at some of the country's finest restaurants, I can say without hesitation that his dishes are nothing short of sublime, and if you crave Indian food you can save yourself a trip to Mumbai or Delhi and hightail it over to the Melt Café at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Singapore to experience true brilliance in Indian cooking. After sampling some of the buffet items available the evening we were there and telling Chef Kumar how incredible they were, he surprised us by making a couple of dishes just for us. I am still savoring the complexity of his butter chicken and the chicken biryani (presented beautifully no less) was nothing short of outstanding. Coming back to southern California and the eating the Indian food here only validates my opinion about his cooking as the Indian food here is generally lackluster and ordinary. Not so with the dishes we tried at the Melt Café and kudos to Chef Kumar for making our dining experience there memorable and well beyond anything we would have expected for a restaurant outside of India. If you're traveling to Singapore and want to have a top notch buffet along with insanely creative Indian dishes, make a reservation at the Melt Café and make sure that Chef Kumar is there in the kitchen

Brought my parents to visit Melt for the birthday and we were wowed by the service. Selection of food is ok and oysters were fresh. Great selection of dessert made up for the mains
4
Good variety of seafood. Dessert spread was impressive. Service was wonderful. Teppanyaki spread could be improved though
5
We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a week over Christmas and found our daily breakfasts at Melt Cafe to be the best. All ingredients were very fresh and the variety couldn't have been better, from continental breakfasts to asian cuisine and catering to all ages. We looked forward to breakfast every day and Ryan and his team catered to all our needs. The service was exceptional. The ambience of the dining areas and the facilities were also excellent. We were very happy and would highly recommend Melt Cafe! Caroline
2
We ate here twice during our 8-night stay at the hotel. Both experiences were highly disappointing. The first night, I ordered a salad and my husband had a raw tuna dish. The tuna looked to be leftovers from a sushi bar and did not taste fresh. The greens in my salad were wilted and the rest had no flavor. The dressing was unpleasant. The second time, my husband dined alone and had a similarly unpleasant experience. So -- we do NOT recommend Melt, which is a shame, as we had such a positive experience with every other aspect of the hotel.
5
Food presentation is very beautiful, service is quick and very efficient, friendly as well, definitely recommend to ppl considering Melt
5
It was a pre-christmas dinner. With a cozy ambience, my family and I were no doubt spoilt with the excellent service and tasty food
3
Firstly, I'm a UOB cardmember and there is suppose to be a discount. But they said is a festive meal so there isn't any discount and the confirmation email would have stated. Open the confirmation email and it's not stated. Also the card did state that the date is valid. In the end they still let me have the discount on the condition of signing up for a really complex membership. More importantly the food is mediocre compared to other buffet of the same price range. Lastly we are so shock that they didn't even bother to informed us that the buffet is ending and just cleared all the food like they are chasing us away. Not a place I will want to reccomen
2
So this is a Friday before the Christmas weekend. It seems they have added in more people but the same food stations so it seems awfully crowded. There are queues at the counters and the food aisles. I have to say I’ve had better buffets in Singapore. There were 6 food aisles / salads, soups, chinese, stews, indian, miscellaneous. The kebabs were nice but who serves turkey kebabs and no chicken? The live pasta counter was random, they had spaghettti and gnocci, and tomato and boulognese sauce, I dont eat beef so I took the gnocci with tomato sauce, so bland I couldn’t dnt go beyond 2 gnoccis. Salads were nice but no a-ha! Parts of Indian food were nice. They could have served breads hot but the naans in the dish were cold and hard. The chinese spread didn’t look appetizing at all nor did the soups. I didn’t try the sushi because there were long queues. The desserts were nice I have to say! For 85 SGD + 20 SGD for the wine, all adding to SGD 247 for 2 with taxes I think it was definitely not worth it. It was challenged on all fronts - variety, food presentation, taste and just the overall ambience with so many people and associated noise, long queues at the counters. I didn’t walk out satiated at all, as I would have wanted, for spending that kind of money. The service was nice, and the manager came back very quickly for feedback after I wrote similar comments on the feedback form. I’ll probably not go bad, with so much good choice in Singapore one strike is all you get unfortunately!
5
We were spoilt for choice at the buffet here. An awesome variety of food available. Fresh and cold seafood include lobsters, crabs, prawns, oysters. BBQ grill includes lamb, chicken wings, salmon, prawns. Cooked food include baked salmon, meat, beef stew, indian food, tom yam soup, drunken prawns, laksa etc. Dessert includes fresh fruits, chocolate fondue, cakes, tarts, ice cream, waffles.
5
Staff were professional and friendly towards us. We loved the atmosphere at the cafe. Large variety of buffet dishes to choose from and the food were delicious and scrumptious too. Will return next year when I fly to Singapore in the summer. I wish that I had taken photos of the place but oh well. Highly recommended for visitors of all different nationalties and cultures as well. One of the best places to eat at within Singapore.
5
Don't know where to start, The choice is amazing from continental to English to Asia. Once you have finished breakfast, there is no need to eat lunch, you are so full with the excellent choices they serve
4
The lunch buffet has a large variety and the food was flavourful and delicious. We were greeted warmly from the staff and they were very prompt in clearing our use a plates from the table.
5
We were there for pre-Xmas dinner buffet. The service was great! I requested to sit away from children and they placed us nicely away from the main crowd. The waiter serving us was very attentive. He was concerned as he noticed that my mum only had one plate of food... He came by to ask if everything was ok and offered to bring her tea. (She just eats like a bird and it has nothing to do with the quality of the food.) I watched other patrons do it so I did it too. I took cheese from the cheese counter...put them on fresh oysters and had the BBQ booth staff have them grilled. The grilled oysters were really good!!! I think their desserts are well thought through. They put yuzu mousse/cream in their green tea opera cake. They also had sea salt caramel in their moist chocolate cake. Excellent really! Unlike other international buffets which just have passable / regular desserts... I think Melts Cafe pays attention to their desserts! If there is something that needs improvement... It would be their wine selection. Granted that it's only $20 for free flow beer and wine... They only offer Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc. No Riesling nor Chardonnay! I would have preferred to pay more for a wider variety of wine. All in all... Definitely worth visiting
4
Average food not much hot food selection but cold food is good. Crabs are fresh attentive waiter. Grea
5
The buffet fare is excellent and value for money . But the service is the one that stood out . Special mentions to Alex Wong and Malou Garcia who looked after us & treated us like royalty . The morning breakfast also good as well with the exception of one dish - pastry for dipping in the congee on the morning of 11/12/17 was old and inedible so a complaint was taken by Marcus , the manager and the problem was rectifird within few minutes . Congratulations to the team at Melt Cafe for a job well done . We will come to stay in the Mandarin Orietnal again & sample your food agai

Internet showed melt cafe served the best buffet in Singapore, and we decided to give it a try as they also serve pre-Christmas lunch buffet at SGD65++ per person.We arrived around 12.45pm and was warmly greeted by the hostess and she show us the buffet spread. varieties of food selection from western, Asian, Indian, salads bar, seafood station (prawn, lobster crawl, mussels), desserts. Taste: overall is good. However, seafoods no replenish at 1pm and only left few lobster craw, few prawns, few mussels on the counter, salads turned dark brown colour and no replenish again, no cranberries sauce for Christmas turkey (this upset me the most), only left few fresh cut fruits like pineapple, honeydew on the counter and no replenish, No stollen bread but they promote it on the internet. No replenish for everything. I rated this as “average” is for the service team, but I will rate “terrible” for the food quality and selections. Attached the photo of their promotion menu but they didn’t served what they have promised. Not really a Mandarin Oriental hotel standard. Not worth the pricehttps://photos.mandarinoriental.com/is/content/MandarinOriental/singapore-restaurant-melt-pre-festive-lunch-and-dinner-menu?_ga=2.116728975.860313955.1512901907-344457369.151290190

Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Great variety of food and desserts - the only thing I can nitpick on is that the crabs were not the best quality and the black pepper lobster claws were difficult to eat (perhaps the shell could have been smashed open a bit so it’s easier to eat
5
We came here for both breakfast and a lunch when we stayed at the mandarin oriental. The staff was very courteous and the food was delicious. Would recommend this place.
5
Enjoyed a very good buffet here in a marvelous setting with friendly, helpful staff.Lots of choice... Seafood, Indian, Japanese., BBQ, western. The desserts were beautiful, creative and delicious.
5
Love the food. Lobster and oyster are fresh. Grill station is nice.The spread is huge and i will be back another day to taste the rest of the food
4
The buffet spread served many cuisines and catered a decent range of dishes. Everything was delicious and up to standard with the waiting staff always around to help kindly.I would advise that the buffet spread be widened to introduce more variety and the seafood station was mostly empty during the time I was present, with a few oysters and crabs only found at any moment
5
Brought my goddaughter here for her birthday lunch on 28th October 2017.Reservations confirmed promptly on email and it’s thoughtful that they asked if it’s a special occasion!Was one of the first customers to arrive into the restaurant at 12:02pm but was politely asked to wait a little while. I could see that the restaurant manager was briefing the service crew before the lunch rush and that showed how serious the Mandarin Oriental took their stellar service principles.Was shown to our table by the lovely hostess who asked if I was familiar with the layout of the buffet. As this wasn’t my first time in the restaurant, I just said I was familiar and was seated promptly. As I was waiting for the kids and friends to arrive, I could see that she patiently explained to every guests how the food were all sectioned and laid out. After everyone arrived, we started our feast! As it was a lunch buffet, it wasn’t as comprehensive as their dinner or Sunday brunches. Rightfully so, because the price is also lower for lunch. But they had plenty to satisfy! Cold seafood section had the juiciest huge crab claws! Lovely cold mussels as well!They also had cold cuts, a comprehensive salad section and cold starters. Melt is famous for their Indian selections and even for lunch, they had a variety of northern and southern Indian dishes on offer. Quite a substantial Asian selection as well, if Indian isn’t your thing.While their continental selection was limited, the roast beef made up for it! Succulent and juicy. The brown sauce accompanying it was sublime.Dessert line was good, with their Melt Chocolate Cake and Chocolate “sand” coming up tops! If you’re a fan of cheese, they have about 5 on offer from the mild to the deliciously ambrosial! All the while, service was prompt, efficient and warm. They kept the dining table spotlessly clear of used plates and water glasses were never empty.Highlight for my goddaughter was when a chocolate cake was brought out for her with our server singing Happy Birthday! The cake wasn’t a small slice but a whole cake! My goddaughter was obviously thrilled!All in all, it was a wonderful experience and Melt still ranks as one of the best all day/buffet restaurants in Singapore! Price is on the high side but service, food and ambiance justify every penny! If you want the absolute luxurious Mandarin Oriental dining experience, do try their Sunday Brunch as well! I’ll definitely be back

I visited Melt cafe for the second time after 6 years. I was very pleased that the quality of food has been consistent and has been good for so long. I was very happy that the staff were very friendly and very keen on giving us what we needed. The food was very good but I felt that the variety was a little lacking. There was a large presence of Indian and Chinese food but there was a huge lacking of Western style food. Pasta, grilled beef and chicken are some examples of food that is missing. I have to commend on the fact that desserts were definitely of the largest variety and were very delectable. I do hope that Melt Cafe would continue to modify their range of dishes to better serve regular buffet-goers such as myself and my family and I hope that we will see some improvements for our next visit
5
Service at the restaurant is wonderful. The servers were really attentive. Great seafood and value for money
5
My wife and myself regularly visit Melt Cafe for special occasions. The food quality is consistent with lots of high quality food choices. The dessert station is amazing with lots of choices.However, just a suggestion for BBQ station. It is better to provide seafood BBQ and Satay to bring the buffet to next level
5
Our family of 4 dined there back in July 2017. The staff was very friendly from the start: when phoning for a reservation I explained that I wanted to time our seating with the fireworks outside. Nisha, our waitress, happened to be the one who took my call, so she remembered my request and went out of her way to let us know when the fireworks started and when they did, offered to keep our table for us. Except that we had already started to eat and the food was soooo good, we didn't want to leave ( I sent the kids out with a camera instead!) The variety of food on offer is amazing, and I am grateful for the manager ( whose name escaped me, sorry ) to have guided us through the different stations: fresh seafood, indian curries, bbq station, japanese selection, and of course the desserts! There is enough to please the whole family and we certainly ate our S$85 worth!And the additional S$20 ( each ) for free flow of wine and beer must be the nicest touch ( though we didn't know about it beforehand and spent nearly S$100 on pre dinner drinks at the adjoining bar!!)Would definitely come back when we return to Singapore
5
Very friendly, attentive & helpful staff.. Nice food as well! *Thumb up* Have requested during my reservation for a small Birthday cake for my Husband and they remembered :
5
We had Breakfast and Dinner at the Melt cafe. Buffet Options were very appropriate and food quality was good. Service at this hotel is very good
4
This is an excellent buffet restaurant. A good mix of Indian, Chinese, Japanese and western selections. The fresh seafood like oysters, mussels, crab, shrimp and lobster is top notch! The sushi and sashimi were also fantastic. Wished they had roasted duck or BBQ pork.This is an excellent place if you are a guest at the hotel and want to dine in. Breakfast is also great with an excellent selection of Asian and western breakfast choices. The western choices include fruits, yoghurt, cereals, eggs (made in every way you want), bacon (soft and well done), sausages, hash browns, mini pancakes, cheeses and many more. Asian selections include noodles, soups, congee, stews and soups. You can load up here and not need anything until dinner - too much deliciousness to choose from - you'll likely over-eat. The blessing-and-curse of the buffet
5
Melt Cafe has been one of my favorite! The spread is pretty good and the standard of the food is there. In terms of taste for main dishes, it did seem to have dropped in standard by a little (as compared to the past; years ago).Nonetheless, the seafood quality is definitely there - eg: the meat of the crab is really sweet. Not only that, the dessert corner is definitely good!If not for the steep pricing, I would visit Melt Cafe pretty often. In sum, definitely a great place to dine
4
Had buffet lunch at Melt Cafe and was impressed by the spread and impeccable service! Will be back again!
5
Only had breakfast here and it was wonderful great selection of food and very fresh eggs cooked to serve , nothing missing here and staff are wonderful always smiling and happy to see you all in all a great experience
5
The meals here are many and varied but always consistently generous and flavourful. The Chefs are justifiably proud of the high standard of their food and cater for food allergies and corresponding variations to the menu. Thoughtful staff are ever ready to help and assist in ordering and delivering the beautifully presented food. Ryan's capable staff are a pleasure to confer with.
5
Ate like a pig... they cater to all tastes... love the spread and the service. Melt for a Sunday brunch and then sit by the pool... nice
5
Melts is known for having a wide array of dishes ranging from Thai to European but honestly the show stopper there is the Indian food. People could argue that going to a buffet and paying over a hundred dollars to eat naan and curry is a waste of money when there are other things like oysters and lobster. To those people I ask, have you tried their tandoori selection? I would just like to thank chef Santosh and his team of cooks for making my meal at melts an unforgettable one. Im not saying that the rest of the food is bad. It's just that when you have something that outshines the others so obviously it's hard not to make it the main topic of this review. Also the bartender whose name I can't quite remember (it was ganesan if I am not mistaken) was very attentive to our wants and needs.
5
We were staying in the hotel for one night and hadn't chosen anywhere for dinner, we looked at all the restaurants in the hotel then decided to go for this and we were not disappointed!! I usually don't like going for buffets but the standard of food and choice were outstanding. Lots of seafood, great curries, fresh nann and pasta station. The deserts were excellent and the staff were great in fact they went and got my desert and made up as if it had come out of the kitchen.We went for the drinks package of unlimited wine which I thought was great value, as I previously mentioned the staff were great and very helpful. Would be difficult not to visit here again if we were in Singapor
4
Seafood disappointing, lobsters tasteless, had been frozen, mudcrab claws small but tasted ok, oysters fresh, roast duck, suckling pig, cha sui pork, all very nice. Curries were very good, home made chutneys and pickles, naan all delicious, sashimi nice, salmon on bbq good, Desserts- you must have their signature chocolate cake- light and delicious, good cheese collection, free glowing Ruinart champagne with espresso martinis and other cocktails included for $158 plus 17% taxe
5
Good service the moment we stepped into the restaurant. The seafood was very fresh. The laksa and briyani was very fragant. All the other dishes were delicious. The dessert was aplenty to
5
Been to this restaurant during my short visit in Singapore. The buffet spread is second to none. I enjoyed the seafood selection and the homemade frozen yoghurt! Service wise, everybody were very accommodating and warm. Good food and good service are always the perfect combo
5
It was impressive. Both food and service was of superb standard. Highlight that I had was the Aglio Olio and 'spicy seafood soup' which is simply prawn mee soup which is pretty damn good as well. A must tr
5
The breakfast on offer is terrific with a great choice and good value however this could apply to dozens of hotel's I have visited across the globe.What's sets this apart are the staff from the initial greeting with a huge smile to the constant care throughout breakfast it really is the best breakfast experience I have had the pleasure of... well done and keep it up
2
seafood not fresh , v limited choice for the price i'm paying will never go back again super disappointed
5
My 3rd time for champagne brunch. Initially disappointed that vevue Clicquot was replaced but Ruinart wasn't that bad.The seafood was amazing as usual . Oysters , lobsters, lamb stew , luv the sashimi ebi and your cheese collection very very good.suggestions I have is to replace your Tom yum soup (mediocre quality), add more flavour to your danggui duck and consider adding more cooked vegs to the spread . Love the service. They were very personable and attentive. Kudos to them.I'll be back 
4
Very nice place. Just love the crabs and oysters. Quite good customer service. A suitable place for family with the young and old.
5
Had lunch here with the kids and the staff, especially the manager, could not have been more welcoming and friendly. Very good food, as you would expect
4
Had weekday buffet lunch with my colleagues.The varieties for the sushi/sashimi and fresh/cold seafood were too little, although the indian cuisine and dessert spread were quite good. Some of the dishes were too salty.Overall, atmosphere was pleasant, waiter/waitress were friendly and attentive
5
Friendly and attentive staffs taking care our needs. Food variety is ok and the quality is above averag
3
Food is alright but no surprise. Service is good. Wish could have more hot dishes, Not enough vegetables and desserts. Fruits are good
5
Had Christmas lunch and it was fantasic. Lots of choices for food so something for all tastes. Turkey, curry, BBQ and loads more. The staff are friendly and are always there to top up your drinks. Had such a nice time there, we are going to book again this year
4
I celebrated my 60th birthday in June 2017 at Melt Cafe, Mandarin Oriental, Singapore and really enjoyed the buffet dinner there. They have good varieties of food and very fresh quality seafood and the hot dishes are of very good quality too. Staff are very friendly, attentive and efficient. Environment is warm and comfortable. Will surely come back for the buffet again
4
The lunch was okay but the live session was underwhelming. The service from the server was fantastic.
3
The place and staff are undoubtedly very good and in line with Mandarin Hotel standard. The quality of food is acceptable.Mind you, I was quite hungry.I cannot judge the price since my friend paid for the tab.All in all, quite acceptable for a quiet meal
3
Above average food, mediocre spread, replenishment of food needs to be faster. Booked 1 month in advance but was given corner seat near to kitchen.
5
There was a wide selection of food, a nice layout of the area and great ambience. Staff were helpful and friendly && they even provided a birthday cake to mark the occasion :) Would recommend
3
Visited the restaurant for a casual family dinner. Good first impression with friendly and accomodating staff.Ordered from the ala carte menu for a mix of local and western food. Overall food were presented well but lacks the authenticity of a local flavour and pasta was not Al Dante as requested
4
Good food with fresh seafood and excellent staff service! Enjoyed the food and will come back again
3
I would rate this as an "ok" but not coming back to dine in again. expensive for the type of selections they have
3
It is maybe above average but equally cannot call it Very Good. The service is excellent and very friendly, the food overall is also pretty good but there is a but. This is a restaurant at a Mandarin Oriental and you feel like your at a buffet restaurant at a mid level hotel.The value is reasonable and it is clearly setup to serve a lot of people, but it shows. Both for breakfast and dinner it is just to busy and crowded, it doesn't handle the number of people well and for some reason feels dark and dated.The staff are great as mentioned but considering all the options in Singapore I really think Melt needs updating to bring it to the standards of something you would expect at an MO
5
Buffet style that caters for all tastes. Excellent staff. Food excellent too, always refreshed , piping hot. Some days there is a BBQ station too. There is European , Chinese , Japanese , Indian and Singaporean dishes. Never seen so much fresh seafood. Good value.
5
Probably one of the best buffet I've had in Singapore. I particularly like the ambience and presentation of dishes and the desserts at Melt Cafe. Food was of high quality and so is the service. Would definitely revisit when there's a promotion
5
Had breakfast and lunch there during my stay and the spread and food was quite nice. There juices and fruits and Laksa were amazing
3
The dinner a family reunion to celebrate the start of summer holidays. Melt has always been our choice restaurant in Singapore for family celebrations.Arrival:This time was rather disappointing. Firstly, the arrival experience by the hostess were lukewarm. There were 2 ladies but neither knew who was looking up for our names after checking who we were, and thereafter, neither could decide who should show us our table.Food:Excellent variety and an expansive cuisine options. However, plenty of areas for improvement.1. hot items were not hot. it is unacceptable to have hot soup in room temperature, or the hot dishes almost cold sitting in their respective gravy.2. bbq at the garden. it was almost like food rationing. there was a long queue, and after nearly 20 mins of queue, one is given a piece of steak, 2 sticks of satay, etc. It was ridiculous. I felt so sorry for the guests in front of me, seeing them in a begging state for more portions. Fortunately, I was a small eater. The chef, I felt even more sorry for him, in the heat, he was oblivious to the situation or the queue, he was just grouchy-faced, bbq-ing the food and rationing it at best.However, the second chef to the rescue managed to disperse the queue by producing more quantity suffice for self-serve. Suggest to work out your process and not have guests beg for 2 more sticks of satay to make it 4.3. Replenishment of food was slow and unattended. Chefs and staff walk about and without any attention to details. Dirty table top of spills uncleaned from the start of our dinner till the end. By the time, we were ready for desserts, we didn't even know what were the desserts available, as most plates were empty. We can understand why the waffle queue was extremely long.4. Ice-cream - Basic flavours for children and adults alike are strawberry, chocolate and vanilla. Why is there only chocolate and the rest are blended unpopular flavours.5. Chocolate Fountain - Suppose this is also mostly enjoyed by children, yet none of the regular children friendly items ideal for chocolate dipping were available. No strawberries, no grapes, instead pineapple and honeydew. Seriously?Service:Other than the hostess and BBQ Chef, we've identified two wonderful staff. Yay!Special compliments to:James, waiter (is said to be a Korean) was prompt in clearing the plates, refilling our glasses, and attending to the other guests around us.Vincent, Chef (Chinese) whom we spoke to regarding the lukewarm food and soup. He not only took immediate action but returned to update us that he has taken care of it. He even brought a bowl of hot soup, assuming it was what we wanted.Improvement on staff's attention to details, please

We enjoyed our dinner with the wide spread of food. The bbq station would have been better without the queue. But then again, that's what made the food fresh and hot.
5
Had a great meal with my kids here. Thanks to Alex Wong for personalized touch with my two young kids and for a great night

Was there for biz lunch and was disappointed with food and ambience. Canteen atmosphere. No oysters on ice for lunch. Only Indian food was good.
5
My birthday boy wanted to have a seafood feast and thus I chose this place. This is second time I was here. The seafood spread is good - lobster, fresh oyster, 3 different types of crabs, shellfish and mussels and cold prawns. The Indian food is still as great especially the on the spot made nan. The dessert and the cheese counters fantastic. I love their hotel marshmallow and truffle chocolates balls. The cafe even arranged for a small melt chocolate specialty cake for the birthday boy. Great service from the waitress- Iyna. Highly recommend if you want special.

The dinner at Melt Café was really great. The fresh seafood are really attracting. The taste of sashimi is delicious. Indian section, Chinese section, Japanese section, European section and deserts section made the complete dinner. The waffle and ice-cream, cheese with biscuit, chocolate cake and fresh fruits are the ending of the course.Hope we will go again and taste the nice food of this buffet

Went to melt cafe for lunch buffet after the renovations with a group of friends. Booking process was simple and efficient, arrived and got seated without fuss. Food was not as plentiful as originally thought. Pastries no longer as good as they used to be, live station staff was nonchalant and food prepared was very average. The mussels and lobster claws on offer seems to be frozen and not fresh, indian cuisines offered was plentiful. Macarons are really good but overall a poor and disappointing experience for a 5 star hotel buffet
5
Maitre D' and wait staff were all very professional and friendly. Seafood was plentiful in variety and very fresh. My favorite was the dessert of waffles, which I topped with maple syrup and chantilly cream, a nice touch. When we called for the bill, the waiter very kindly gave us an unexpected discount for the two grandparents in our party. On top of the UOB discount and 1-eats-free-for-every-3, we paid about $80 per person for a meal that had wonderful variety and great quality
3
All the seafood were fresh. The bbq station lamb n sausages were good. Salmon were fabulous. More varieties at the Japanese section will b good. Roasted chicken were good. Too back it doesn't come with rice. A small plate of rice with chicken will definitely enchance the dish. The laksa were light n refreshing. A good varieties of cut fruits n deserts. Waffle were soft n good. Like the cheese section with biscuit. A small oven able to toast the bread lightly will good. The display of the Indian food wasn't appetising. No colors & quality. The brani rice were so..so. chicken curry the rest really . Properly should remove the whole section n put something else more colorful n flavorful. Overall soothing ambience
5
We stayed for 3 nights in the Mandarin Oriental and had breakfast each morning in the Melt Café. The food and service is excellent, a tremendous range of foo
3
Comfortable & nice dinning environment. Overall food was average. Personally I like their pastries especially the chocolate cake that melt in your mouth. I was disappointed that they have run out of ice cream cone when I am ready to have ice cream as my last dessert.
5
The place was so relaxing. Very quiet . Not too much variety however the food was great . Fantastic. Remarkable. I mean I don't eat meat I love the seafoods , they were all fresh . Very tasty. Definitely I will come back there. Worth the money. They're Indian was so great as well . So love. Many selection of desserts and fruits. 1 thing I noticed though was they're Japanese selection, very little variety. Maybe they have cycle, I don't know. But other than that, sooo loovvveee itttt...!!!
5
Friendly service, excellent choice of food. Went there twice as so good. I don't eat meat but found they had plenty to choose from.Try the chocolate cake made especially for the hotel. Delicious
5
Celebrated Mother's Day at Melt Cafe and left fully satisfied. Melts Cafe never fails to deliver a pleasant and appetising experience

Singapore is the land of buffets. It seems every hotel has its own. The Melt Cafe has an international buffet with a special distinction: in addition to its very fine international buffett(Indian, European, seafood specialities etc..) it literally has a real barbecue located just outside the buffet dining area in the open air. There, one can order barbecue steak, chicken and so on - cooked in real time while you wait! I have attended many buffets in many styles, this is the first buffet which includes a barbecue!While it's not cheap, it's value for money.As a side note, inside the Mandarin Oriental and on the way to the Melt Cafe, there are many ornamentals and interesting artifacts......very nice decorations. Even the shape of the bar is worth a look
4
Standard selection of Western, Japanese, Chinese and Indian cuisine. Limited seafood on offer, and few Indonesian / Malay food. With outstanding promotions (perhaps year-round) and tie-up promotions with major credit cards like UOB (25% off), I could not ask for more. Service staff were patient, nice and very accommodating (pictures, free birthday cake, advice on which food is good to try). Good value
2
First timer, booked 2weeks in advance to celebrate hubby birthday, with restaurant confirmation in return. But upon arrival, my reservation no where to be found in system. i have show proof of booking. Allocated seats near plates collection point. My bag and seat spilled with curry sauce by supervisor. Casually cleaned my bag and seat with napkin. I have to repeat and ask for thorough clean of my seat and clean my own bag again. Apologised us with complimentary 2 glasses of white wine. Sushi not fresh and not properly slice into pieces. Two three piece joint together. Prawn is fresh. Food is salty. Another table guest also complained to the Chef. Revd a complimentary small birthday cake for hubby when I show my booking earlier. Overall, Disappointed despite high rating from numerous web review
4
It's not my first visit to Melt, but the food always impress! Fresh seafood - oysters, prawns, sashimi etc but the snow crab legs are too salty. Worth the money when you dine as a Dining Society member with good discount.
5
It is not LasVegas Style buffet (Good). This buffet has a great range of "Quality" Seafood, Indian, Pasta, Japanese Sushi, and outdoor BBQ.For an additional $20, you can add unlimited beer and wine. Fantastic value and the seafood is fresh = Prawns, Oysters, Lobster tails, Muscles, Scallops
5
Food was excellent. The variety was pleasing. Staff very courteous and very helpful. The environment was also very conducive. Overall money well spent.

Things we expect when paying 198 dollars a person for a buffet:1. Our glasses to never run dry.2. Dirty plates to be bused from the table.3. A minimum level of decorum and basic human decency from our fellow diners.Things we do not expect:1. The buffet running out of food.2. Children in the deep throes of a jelly bean binge running amok looking for (but never finding) their inside voices.3. "Selected Cocktails of the Day" which taste like rock gut alcohol and Koolaid were mixed in an industrial-sized rubbish bin the night before. I'm talking about you, Easter Martini.That said, I do give the restaurant high marks for their tandoori fish. And people seemed to enjoy the Easter Bunny's coquettish helper.Tip: Arriving at 11:50 will assure you a top spot in line for Sunday brunch, but you will also risk getting trampled by other guests when they open the velvet rope. Consider arriving at 12:15 because you are dignified human being and not a churlish buffoon
2
Sushi not fresh.Snow crab not fresh n tasteless. Not shark fin soup.Overall food not attractive. Why must write more than 100 characters
4
Good quality food. Love the clams & mussels soup the most. Oysters were tasty. Waffles and ice cream were awesome. However there is not a lot of variety of food and dessert. Some desserts are too sweet and the chocolate eclairs are too bitter.. Food aside, great service! Staff were very friendly and quick on clearing plates.
4
The place so enjoy and relaxFood also so fresh and nice.Never get bored, so enjoy.The waiters also kind and helpfu
4
We had soups and salads. We arrived too late for the buffet, which was still set up and really looked out of this world, with every type of seafood you might imagine. Soup, service and drinks were very good. I would love to try the buffet. Be warned, this restaurant is very expensive
5
Food was good and I love their Indian section particularly their curries! Waitress was very friendly too.
3
Food was average. Not much hot items selection. Mostly cold dish and Indian cuisine. Which is not my preference. I went there during my birthday.
5
I had an excellent birthday celebration for a good friend of mine at melts. The food selection was amazing and the service never fails to impress! This was my second time to Melts and I would definitely recommend the great experience to my other friends. The service staff were very attentive and cleared our plate efficiently. In particular, the service staff assigned to our table, Rami, was very pleasant. I could tell she was passionate about her job and went the extra mile to make us feel at home and comfortable. For example, she served us a complimentary Garlic Naan and encouraged us to try the Indian food selection. When she brought out the birthday cake for my friend, she sang together with me to celebrate his birthday. She was sweet and smiled every time she refilled our glasses or cleared our plates. Her excellent service made our evening and would like to thank her!
5
My first experience with Melt's Cafe is nothing short of perfect. The ambience, lightning, furniture and the layout of the buffet spread is simply elegant and classy. The buffet spread were very lavishly laid out and each individual dish were prepared and made to perfection.My best highlight of the dining experience was the staff Christie and Rani. Christie has a cheerful disposition and a beautiful smile. She simply makes the customer feel at home. Rani, the Indian server, is one of the rarest waitress I have ever seen. She takes pride in her job and she attended to the needs of every customers, and even strike conversations to ease the first timers (like me) into the ambience and setting. I am so comfortable dining with Rani as my server, that I will go back again just for the experience.THe staff on the whole made me and my boyfriend felt like we were dining as Kings. And this sort of experience can only be found at places like Melt Cafe
5
This is the second time I celebrated my birthday at Melt Café and I must say, I enjoyed the food and the ambience there. The staff were attentive and initiative to take a photo of us. The food spread is great and seafood were fresh.
5
There's nothing to not love about the buffet spread for their breakfast. Service was wonderful and I already am looking forward to dine here for my next stay at MO.
5
if you take your breakfast not in the quietness of the Club Lounge but visit Melt Cafe instead you will not believe what you see. A huge variety of everything you can ever think of awaits you, I think you will not find such a large breakfast anywhere els

Nice experience ,esp e birthday cake the staff prepare.My Girlfriend was surprise by the cake as I didn't told her anything prior to tha
5
Located on Floor 4 of the mandarin Oriental. Reasonably priced at just under £30 each for breakfast and £60 each for dinner. The range of international and chinese fare on offer was incredible, the service attentive and impeccable throughout. Well recommended
5
Since I was traveling for work, my days would begin really early. Breakfast would set my mood (how good or bad it was) and it soon was a pleasure to head down here quickly over several days. The service here was fast, and the options at the breakfast buffet are just right - not too many, which can become confusing, and not too little that it feels thrifty. The wait staff were also quite thoughtful. One of the best hotel breakfasts I've had
2
We were staying at the hotel and thought that we would eat in one morning impressive options many different cuisines We went for a continental breakfast which was OK but when the bill come it was more expensive that the ROOM SERVICE option for the same food!This is a real downer and was not worth the mone
5
Excellent help yourself buffet in the Melt cafe serving a huge variety of food styles in elegant surroundings. Very attentive service by the staff and the food was delicious
4
Despise the fact that the restaurant was way less crowded for lunch compared to previous dinners I've had here, the food quality was retained. While the variety of dishes is expectedly lower for lunch, the spread is still good for an enjoyable meal. Sashimi, sushi, a small seafood on ice section, asian wok frys, indian curries and tandoori, western stews and roasts and a decent cheese and desert spread are offered. Particularly worth noting are the well executed Indian tandoori roasts with classical condiments like raita and mint chutney. The desert selection is also luxurious for lunch and I enjoyed a great apple crumble. Overall, certainly worth a visit for diners looking for a buffet near the cityhall/marina bay/fullerton area
4
The services is good and waiters are very polite and friendly. Lot of food selection, nice deserts for deserts lover
5
Was looking for a hotel buffet for a team lunch and we were all very satisfied patrons. Every dish offered tasted good and a few of us actually went for a second round of their Laksa!In the month of March, pay by UOB credit card and get 30% off the lunch buffet!
5
We were welcomed pleasantly by Nancy and we were lead to our table. Paneer was our server the whole night who regularly checked on us. He’s friendly and accommodating. He offered us good selection of wine. Great.The buffet area is spacious and they have wide variety of different cuisines. It’s totally worth spending. I love the cheese and salad section. They have good seafoods with selection of lobster, prawn and salmon. They serve lamb, pork, chicken and tuna in the BBQ area and they have more than 10 types of sauces i think. Superb. I’m an Asian but I’m not fond of our dishes, seriously. Though the Asian Section is a must try. Interesting. In addition, they have maki, sushi and sashimi. My friends ordered garlic cheese naan which they paired with the indian dishes. I don’t eat Indian dishes but I can just eat the Naan the whole night. Perfect. The dessert is heavenly. I have tried the Thai sticky rice with mango and cream and I love it. They serve yogurt, ice cream, waffle, different cakes, chocolates and selection of fruits. Scrumptious dinner
4
Tried the Nasi Goreng here and loved it, though the place is slightly over priced but I'd say it's still worth i
2
I was told by the staff before I went for the buffet dinner that uob card has 30% off total food bill. During payment the bill comes out that it was less 15% instead of 30%.
4
Melt Cafe had a range of selection. Fresh oysters, lobsters, crayfish, prawns. They also have an Indian section
5
Can only comment on the food that was available for breakfast which was outstanding, actually one of the best buffet breakfast we have had in a hote

I visited Melt Cafe with my family twice during my stay at Mandarin Oriental last week. The breakfast experience was very good - there is a huge variety of buffet, where you can find everything from traditional eggs, pancakes or waffle to local dim sum, huge oriental station with indian cuisine, actually you will find there entering you will come up with. Only minor improvements should be taken, but the Manager is already on to that, what I was assured via email- some vegetarian option for dim sums should be considered and little more seasoning is needed in hot oatmeal and eggs on tomato and bread. But the greatest experience with Melt we had during dinner. Again the food variety in the buffet was enormous and everything was tasteful. Also we loved the indian a'la carte menu - vegetarian biryani was excellent and it has unique presentation. But what (actually whom) made this evening perfect was excellent staff - our host waiter - Genesan and amazing assistant manager Alex were incredible - always there, so nice and tactful and with great doze of humor, literally running towards you with everything you have ordered, we felt very pleased and taken care of. I am more than sure that they are those who had change this evening experience from good and tasty to awesome evening ;-) Thank you so much guys again
1
Had a business breakfast there today.Just dont bother.Had to ask 3 times for order to be taken.In end took over half an hr for food to arrive and it was cold when it did.Saving grace was they only charged for 2 meals, but so disappointing for a 5 star hotel
3
Food is ok, not that fantastic. Need to pay upfront to confirm reservation and will be forfeited if not turn up. Not really good practice. CHOPE should look into this. If I call myself, don't need to pay first. Using CHOPE need to pay, so next time don't use CHOPE unless this issue is resolved
5
Amazing Carbonara and The best homemade strawberry ice cream i've ever have in my life !! And also amazing service from Alex !!!
5
Excellent spread made extra special with the Festive Goodies and specialities. Got to enjoy a great time with friends this CNY.
5
Great variety of cuisines in one setting anyone would say it's value-for-money - Imagine free flow of lobsters (in several renditions) oysters and sashimi. We were very pleased with the quality.
4
The buffett for breakfast and lunch had Indian food, Chinese food and western food. They do not excel at any of the cuisines but they are all good quality and enough variety to make everyone in the party happy. Perfect if you are staying at hotel but probably not worth a trip outside of that
4
As buffets go this was decent.I am not the biggest fan of buffets and for the money would rather 've served, however good choice and really friendly staff.Would go again and much better value than the overrated colony at the ritz Carlton next door.
5
We had a fantastic dinner buffet! Both me, my mom, and sister. There’s a wide variety of food choices and the price wasn’t as costly as we had thought. I definitely loved the dessert and of course, the seafood . Innah, if I recall, and the other staff were all very friendly. We even received a free Shirley temple! I cant remember who it was but thank you. We’d definitely visit again
5
Definitely​ the best place to be at for a dinner buffet! I brought my mom here to celebrate her 55th birthday!! She absolutely loved every single station. As mentioned in all the reviews here, the Indian food selection was definitely their speciality! Desserts and the grill were beyond words! Last but not least, the service here was excellent. I'd be definitely back here again. Definitely worth the price as there's just too many to pick from!
5
Decided to have my husband's birthday dinner here. Service is superb from the moment we went in til we left the place. We both love seafood so we enjoyed the lobsters, crabs, prawns and oysters all we can eat! Will definitely be back!
4
Wonderful service & great food. Glasses of champagne &a some drinks were included. Do try the mandarin mojito. The only problem was the cost...$377 for 2 adults I thought was over the top.
5
Celebrated my mother's 50th Birthday here and I have to applaud the service rendered to us especially by Wai Meng and Rani.We had just three hours to do up some decors and Wai Meng was such a great helping hand for us.Extremely thankful to both of them for taking care of the guests that we invited and going all out to ensure that their cups were filled up and plates cleared up.A special mention to Wai Meng for staying there throughout.Been to many countries and places but I have never come across such a heart warming service.Please do let them know that all the guests that came sang good praises for them and made sure I write a review to commend them(:We will definitely be back!On a side note,the lambs were damn goood!Overall,thank you Melt Cafe's manager for partioning a cozy area to celebrate mum's 50th birthday and accomodating to most of our requests.Your team truly reaches out to many people and exemplary services as such will go a long way
5
I cant ask for anything more when it comes to wide array of food choices it would only be woth Melt Cafe in Mandarin Oriental Hotel! Plus all the staff was so friendly and accomodating! Soleil and Ryan always attends to all our request even getting the seats that we want plus getting our lobsters bbqued outside! So sweet right? And one more thing, i know that Melt always got french macarons but when i asked them that time they said they only have xmas log cakes as no macarons in the buffet line up..so when they saw me that i was a bit sad hehe they suddenly go out of their way by providing macarons for me! I super love the staff of Mandarin Oriental thats why i got membership with them now really worth it! Keep it up guys
5
I have stayed in many five star hotels but none of them was as adorable as this one, you really enjoy your breakfast, do not miss i

Very good products, this is just amazing, I recommend this restaurant, everything were tasty, stew dishes, fresh sea food, nice environment and decoration

We were staying at the nearby Ritz Carlton and decided to have dinner at a different hotel so we selected the Melt Cafe @ Mandarin Oriental. The buffet was excellent with a huge range of international cuisine. The Indian section was particularly worth mentioning. However, what prompted me to write this review was the fantastic level of service at Melt Cafe. Two people at this cafe really stood out. Firstly the Assistant Manager Alex Wong. He was brilliant and made the entire dining experience worth remembering (and even gave me the reason to write this review). Our family is vegetarian and Alex took all the time out to ensure we had sufficient items to eat and even ordered a few separate items which he thought would complement our buffet. Furthermore, he made sure the kids (7 & 11) were well looked after. The second person was the Waiter Ganesh. These two staff members really deserve all the praise. Well done Alex & The Team

Popped in here looking for a late lunch as a non-resident – plumped for the Melt Café as it did sandwiches – sat outside – walking through the restaurant noticed an extensive buffet with different cooking stationsMenus arrived and orders taken – and the experience began – drinks arrived with a bowl of savouries – then a bowl of tomato soup arrived as a complementary starter while we waited for the sandwich – then the sandwich with a couple of additional bowls of salad – plates cleared – bill requested – and then a selection of sweets arrived with ice cream – to be shared Then the bill which had a hefty discount - and finally a hug from Wai Weng for the New Year An amazing unexpected much appreciated memorable experience – thank you very muc
5
Melt never disappoints! Same good standard and great service from the crew. Fresh seafood! Definitely worth the money paid
5
Enjoyed my meal with a "long-time-no-see" friend. Premium food was served including lobster on ice, foie gras and bbq suckling pig for the mid-range price offered for a New Year's Day brunch. We were a little disapointed at first when we were expecting a membership discount on that day, nevertheless, the restaurant staff, Min Kyaw Hein, noticed we were a little disappointed and take care of our table service at most times. We were presented with food items not served from the buffet and that warms our heart. Despite many times of assuring we enjoy our meal, our table service is perfect till we leave the restaurant. I would describe this as an exceptional service provided by the staff even when our disappointment is so small. I would definitely come back again. Keep up the great service
5
Dine in with my working colleagues and we were satisfied with the food variety that was on display. The maine lobster was the highlight on the seafood bar and truffle mashed potato was the best among all the appetizer. Alex was very attentive and ensure all our needs were taken care off!
5
Our family of 2 adults and 2 teens enjoyed a wonderful Christmas brunch at Melt Cafe. The buffet was extensive with traditional fare as well as Indian, seafood, BBQ and sweets options. There was champagne and cocktails as part of our buffet price and the teenagers enjoyed all of the options available. All wonderful food and we all tried to eat something different
5
We had breakfast here four mornings in a row and could not fault the service or the fantastic variety and choices of dishes and cuisines available. The food was excellent quality and in abundance. We sat outside in the garden area which was lovely and preferable out of the air conditioning. Also had a meal there one night and the Nasi Goreng was fabulous. The waiter was very friendly and looked after us well. Even though we did not have the buffet he bought us some soup before our meal and also a variety of sweets to try at the end of the meal, which were delicious.
3
I was not impressed by the variety of food and the quality by a 5-Stars hotel restaurant.Disappointing experience
4
A fantastic spread of different Breakfasts for all tastes, English, Chinese, Japanese, American a truly great choice and service excellent.
4
Love this place. This was ours first visit and it was pleasant suprise. Nice food, nice ambient and excellent service. Adore Mandarin hotels all over the world. I would reccomended everyone to visit Melt cafe
5
Awesome spread, sorry I could not savor the full range.. happy all the same. The staff were attentive.

Staff was attentive. Food was great.A wonderful night well spent with friends.Both indoor and outdoor seating is available

Friends recommended the Christmas desk at the Mandarin Oriental when we first lived in Hong Kong and I couldn't work out how I'd fit everything in our oven. I was amazed by the service, you order whatever you want from an extensive menu and can either collect from the hotel or they will deliver at a time of your choice (for a small additional charge). Impressed by the incredible service, we have been ordering Christmas lunch from the Mandarin for over a decade now, and continued the 'tradition' when we moved to Singapore.It could not be easier. In fact, you don't even have to visit the hotel to avail of this service anymore, everything can be done by e-mail. The restaurant calls to confirm the order a couple of days in advance and again on the day. We had delicious truffled mushroom soup, foie gras terrine, turkey, ham & roast beef (with accompanying vegetables and sauces) and a chocolate log. Everything was delicious and delivered with typically impeccable Mandarin service. It allowed us to enjoy our time with the children, friends and family at home without the stress of having to cook, and had delicious Mandarin Oriental food throughout the afternoon. Thoroughly recommend
3
Melt Cafe has been a favourite of mine for many years. Go there if you enjoy lots of good seafood like crabs and oysters. The only disadvantage is that tables are close to each other and conversations can be heard.
5
My wife and I enjoyed both breakfast and lunch at this outstanding restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Buffet-only, we enjoyed an astonishing variety of superb food and excellent service with each visit. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available
5
Had a great dinner at Melt Cafe. Nice food and best of all, served by Akshay who is such a wonderful waiter. Asked where is the fruit juice counter and he introduced me more food after knowing where to get the juices.A patient and courteous waiter! We need more such foreign talent who can really treat us guests like us better!Thanks Akshay!From Satisfied Frankie
5
I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner during my stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Located on the hotels 4th floor. The staff are exceptionally friendly, and noting is too much trouble. A warm welcome is given to each and all.Seating is comfortable and the ambiance good.So often at buffets, the food has a monotony about it - not here. There is great diversity and appeal! There is an ethnic selection - Western, Indian, Malay, Seafood etc. There was excelled fresh seafood selection including lobster tails, prawns etc. All were obviously fresh and tasteful. Given it was Christmas there was turkey on offer - which tasted good - not too dry as you find sometimes, with a nice selection of trimmings. Good curry too - even for breakfast - I love it. Nice selection of drinks including freshly squeezed juices. Freshly cooked waffles for breakfast are excellent and to die for!!The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating.This restaurant is consistently good and a firm favourite with me. Highly recommended
5
We had our company Christmas dinner at Melt Café last Friday, 16 Dec 2016. Great food and ambience. All their staffs were very polite and responsive. There is this gentleman by the name of Akshay who was always making sure that we are having a great time enjoying the feast. A very kind and efficient staff at Melt Café. Without any reservation, I would strongly recommend everyone to visit Melt Café. (Vijay Suppiah

There's limited choices on the food but overall the ambience and service of the restaurant is excellence!
5
Awesome service from the staff, friendly and helpful. Good experience!
Food was great and lots of variety
5
Recommend to come. Will definately come back again. Brought my collegues here for team dinner, nothing but praise
5
We enjoyed a wonderful buffet and it was impressive .Lots of different counters serving a variety of foods !! Good places for friends and family,All the restaurant staff that we encountered were so wonderfully pleasant ,value of money highly recommended
3
Personally I don't find the buffet worth eating. I don't understand why it was ranked the #2 best buffet in Sg.I have dine there for a couple of times. They have Prawns, Lobsters, clams as seafood on ice. Quality is consider reasonable. Variety of cooked food is not as much as The Line at Shangri-La or Orchard Cafe. They have a bbq session.They do served quite a variety of cakes but not very much to my liking.Service provided by the crews were only so-so. They also don't provide you info on credit card discount when payment was about to make until we ask for it.Personally, I don't enjoy dining at the restaurant
3
Food is not bad overall. But the buffet spread is so spread out n even have outdoors that I missed out the grill section altogether! Seafood selection was so-so. It's quite pricey as well, at close to $90 even with 15% discount! Honestly I don't see much value here.
4
During our stay we tried Melt Cafe for breakfast. Nice place and nice food. The selection is wide, they have Indian, Chinese, and Western variety. Nice and friendly staff. The place is always full of it's hotel guest, full but not crowded.
5
It has been more than a couple of years since I have visited Melt the World Café since I was young, not to mention after they have been recently revamped and renamed as Melt Café. I was initially considering on going elsewhere for a lunch buffet, but I am glad that I chose Melt in the end. The staffs were very attentive and thoughtful to all our needs. Being a huge fan of desserts, their bittersweet chocolate gateau was definitely one of the best chocolate cake I ever had. I told one of the staff that I loved their chocolate cake and bread & butter pudding, but was kind of sad to see it ran out. In the next moment, she dropped by my table with 2 plates in her hands. One of which was the chocolate cake and the other, the pudding. Imagine the shock I had when I least expected that to happen. Talk about a pleasant surprise :)The Assistant Manager was also very thoughtful in explaining to me their restaurant changes and the food selections in detail. I was really pleased with the service. Besides, the environment was conducive, not too noisy nor squeezy, I could have a quiet and slow catch-up with my friend over the entire 2.5 hours lunch.And to add on, I really loved their Indian food selections which no doubt is indeed one of the best I have tried at hotel buffets. Thank you to the staffs and services I have received and I am really looking forward to come back here again
4
Wide variety of food. Bread with butter is nice, cheese is good. Seafood was good. Wide selection of Indian food. Laksa was nice. Dessert section was extensive. Ice cream is nice
1
Poor presentation of food it looked like a messy kitchen rather than a upmarket buffet spread. BBQ station cook portrayed an unwelcoming body language
5
I had breakfast 6 times at Melt during my stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Never got bored of the buffet combinations. Also had an amazing dinnner there as well. Highly recommended. The best buffet for breakfast and dinner I have been to
5
Service outstanding, thanks Raj! Selection of food unbelievable. Too hard to choose what to eat. Try a 62 degree egg. Mmmmm
3
The Oktoberfest theme started at the end of Sept. The beer portion would have been 5 stars. There were 2 choices of German beers on tap, and 2 type of wine. All unlimited. They were good.However, considering the price of the buffet without the alcohol is still pretty steep, the quality of the food disappoints somewhat. The only food that stood out was the stir-fried crab and the sea bass. Tried the braised lamb shank - bland and the meat was tough. There were some sausages and some selection of food, but it was much smaller than other buffets in Singapore.So go for the beer. If you are not drinking, then pick a different one
5
Our family went here to celebrate my mum's birthday. They reserved a nice table for us and a delicious chocolate cake for my mum. The service was really good throughout and when we paid, the employee in the restaurant even tried his very best to give us a discount! (Unfortunately I could not remember his name...). The seafood, especially the lobsters, was marvellous. I have tried lobsters in many cities but this one is the best by far (lobsters were cooked just right ... not "chewy" or raw). Will definitely return to the restaurant if I go to Singapore again
5
Great international buffet! Went there for the Oktoberfest special and we LOVED it! Even the Bavarian music was playing! As Much as we recommend this restaurant for its food quality and great service, we recommend Javed our waiter who made us feel special all evening long. Thank you Javed

I was kinda looking for this dinner, coz of the good reviews it has. Nevertheless I was not impressed. We went in Thursday night and few tables only are taken. The ambience is nice, but that's it.I know I'm not a connoisseur in terms of food, coz I have a simple palate. But the food for me is dry, I'm not sure if the only one noticed that. The quality of food is so-so and you will not come back again. The service was great especially "Sirikit" if got her name right, she is really helpful & bubbly. Nonetheless, if the food is always like that, no point of going back again

Enjoyed the ambience in the Restaurant. The food was sensational and the variety was good. A great value for money restaurant

Upon arrival at the hotel, a concierge showed us the way to the restaurant after noticing that we looked rather lost looking for directions in the lobby. At the restaurant, we were offered a buffet tour by the waitress, an initiative which was a first experience for me. The waitress brought us around the various food stations and provided brief introductions of the cuisines as well as answered any questions we had. The food was delicious and I enjoyed the assortment of desserts. The only drawback would be the price of the buffet, which I thought was too overpriced

for a casual lunch or dinner!We found a quiet table, because Buffet dinner was served. We ordered three different dishes. The taste was very good ! The staff , Alex and Wai Wai,served us very well

Was treated to a Saturday buffet lunch there for my birthday in June. Apparently there was some credit card promotion going on and it was really crowded even around 12pm. Food quality is nowhere near decent and food was not replenished in time due to the number of guests. I suppose it is not exactly the cafe's fault but I do expect more from a place like Melt.Thinking back, my previous experience at Melt was much better as it was actually the Sunday brunch (which does not have the same promotion and presumably, the crowd) and the food was really top-notch.I will recommend Melt cafe despite my recent experience, just not for the buffet promotion if it is still ongoing. It is not worth the painful experience
5
Never disappointed butter prawn and Pepper crab amazing. With the price and service is worth it the value the money and travel.
5
One of the best buffets in Singapore. Excellent food choice, full range including vegetarian, great selection of all kinds from all areas of the world. Service was good and for us parents who would like to have champagne and a brunch and take the kids on a Sunday (when your maid should be having her day off....) they even have a play area for kids which is supervised. Hard to beat in Singapore
5
It was our 2nd time dining in at Melts Cafe, surprisingly the staff still remember us. Melts Cafe has Good Selection of food, the staffs are accommodating and attend us whole heartedly, special mention to Rochell (barbie) Innah, Vanessa & Wai Peng for the good service!. to great service! Keep up the good work

I have never been to Melt Cafe before situated in the heart of Singapore. As we were there early..we enquier if we could enter..They told us to wait for awhile..As 630pm was the official dining time.So we decided to talk a walk nearby.But soon enough one of the staff (Thank you for the kind gesture)walked up to us and even called us by name..that we could enter the dining area.it Was really a nice experience. Upon sitting down.the waiter filled our glasses with water and even told us about the memebership scheme thay they have. We signed up for it.The rest was history.The experience was good.The staff attended to our needs.They cleared the plates fast.And they even have a cake for us.thaks so much. The over all experience was really good!Thank you for making our 4th Annivesary a memorable one!!! Appreciate =

The hotel breakfast here is outstanding. A Wide variety of cuisines offered, all delicious. Fabulous service and great quality.

Buffet lunch at Melt as part of a conference. I'm vegetarian so gravitated towards the Indian food section. This was North Indian food, not South. So I know North Indian food is super creamy, oily, fatty. But this seemed unnecessarily so. This not "clean" food, and why 5 star hotels persist in dishing this sort of stuff up is beyond me. This is fat people's food. Even the jeera rice was glistening with grease. The cuiliflower florets sitting in some sort of curry were nursing-home overcooked. And I can't say the taste was great. The other food item I noticed and ate (non-Indian), the bread, showed promise when you looked at it, but it lacked density. It's what I call "air bread". Disappointing, Mandarin Oriental. How about dramatically reducing the oil and grease you put in your food, and start catering for a more health conscious crowd who don't simply shovel anything down their throats
5
We had a fantastic brunch at the Melt café. The different and many food stations are fabulous. Thank you to Wai Meng who looked after our table and was so nice and helpful
4
Everything was pretty good here. Especially with their seafood and wines. Their staff were all friendly too
5
I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Singapore in August 2016 for 4 nights and I visited Melt every morning for breakfast and once for lunch. The buffet breakfast and lunchtime spread is mind blowing with a huge choice of dishes from all over the world. The quality, taste and presentation of the food was very high. It is difficult to pick out particular dishes as being any better than the others because it was all good, but the made to order omelette and all the fresh fruit selection at breakfast became firm favourites of mine and I also really enjoyed the sushi, sashimi and Indian dishes at lunchtime as well as the homemade marshmallows and the chocolate fountain. The best thing about Melt though is the staff, they were all superb. In a very busy hotel buffet restaurant they managed to run a very efficient yet personal service and they made it look effortless (even though I am certain that a huge amount of hard work goes into running such a well oiled machine!). The service was very attentive without being obtrusive and I was greeted by name at every visit. Many thanks and congratulations to the entire team at Melt for all their hard work and for making my meals at Melt so wonderful.
5
I had a few dinners here during early June and apart from the International/seafood buffet being so good, I dined here more than planned because the staff were superb. I would like to thank Mr Alex Wong and Javed for looking after me so well and I will definitely be back when next in Singapore.The service in this Hotel really sets it apart from many others, world class
4
For the price you pay which is definitely above 50+ for dinner. The food would just be rated slightly above average. But there is a wide variety of seafood, sashimi etc. some roasts, Indian cuisine etc. so overall it's not bad.
5
I had dinner with my friend in melt the world cafe. It's awesome to have the dinner in this restaurant. The food is amazing !Especially the Indian food .Server are always friendly and attentive who offered us sincere service. Excellent
4
The breakfast at Melt is very busy but the spread is awesome. It offers one of the largest selections of food we have ever encountered during a breakfast buffet. It shows the large size of the hotel but although it was crowded it never became truly disturbing. We tried to sit outside as much as possible since this location offers a bit more peace and calm. The food quality was excellent and ranges from Western to Japanese, Indian, Indonesian,etc...
3
Our expectations for the Melt dinner buffet were high. However, we were quite disappointed. The best part of the buffet was the seafood section. The other parts were average. The outside BBQ was not great - the staff there seemed quite uninterested in cooking for their guests. Halfway through the buffet opening time, we were told that there were no more chicken satays at the BBQ. We ordered a medium steak, but when it was served, it was rare.The dessert areas also appeared 'half empty' early on.We have tried numerous dinner buffets in Singapore that were much better than the Melt buffet, and we will prefer these the next time we visit
5
I just arrived the country and checked in to the hotel. It was 9:10pm and the restaurant would end its buffet in 20 min. I rushed there for a quick supper. What I found and received was a friendly welcome, big variety and delicious food, attentive services and above all surrounded by a bunch of restaurant staffs with warm smiling on their face. If you are in town, you should go and visit them. It is of good quality and good value.
5
It was a wonderful experience dining at Melt, we had buffet dinner to celebrate a birthday and was wowed by the extensive selection of food, the design and huge space of the restaurant - I didn't even know where to start. We were brought to our seat and was given a brief introduction around the restaurant. Everything was delicious, fresh and well presented. Waiters were very attentive, one of them quickly presented a crab cracker without me asking for it when he saw that I was struggling with the shell food I was having (the crab legs were fantastic btw). Water was refilled and plates were cleared very efficiently despite a large crowd in the restaurant.As it was for a birthday celebration, they presented the cake to us upon requesting for the bill, we were too full to have it but they suggested to let us take it away knowing that we were already full. Very thoughtful and we really appreciate the gesture. Highly recommended!
5
It was a celebratory evening with a diverse group of friends all with different tastes. The glorious buffet offered lots of tasty options for everyone. Food is of the highest quality.
4
Good buffet spread and we loved the live dessert counter with delicious crepes and waffles. Only complaint was that fresh oyster was not included in the lunch buffet menu. Remember to ask for complimentary parking coupon if you drive
5
Where l start l wonder!! We're welcomed and shown around the different array of fresh gourmet buffet selection of Asian and international food. There'd also sn option of à la carte menu however, my family and l opt to try the buffet and that was the best decision on the day.Our waitress was professional and very experienced at her job. As busy as she was would make recommendations and have the chef make us a new dish from stretch something l thought was exceptional for a buffet lunch. Food cooked to perfection and quite fresh.Next time you're in Singapore please visit Melt Cafe. Great restaurant and an absolute must dine experience
5
Our new favourite dining place in Singapore .Manager Alex and Chef Vinny have made this restaurant a delight to visit with quality fresh offerings abounding. If you have certain dietary requirements then make sure your alert the staff.. they will assist in every way.
5
The variety is amazing, but what really made the difference was their service and caring for their clientele. Really quite extraordinary. The chef for the Indian buffet took it upon himself to prepare special dishes for us, after we ended up chatting with him. You won't be disappointed, great value
5
Went for a small celebration for our daughter's 1st bday with friends. Ameya welcomed us and since we had pre-booked allocated us a nice corner table with hi-chairs as well as kids cutlery. Also allowed us to put banner as well as some ballons and helped us take photos. They also prepared a nice chocolate cake for our Daughter. Needless to see the ambience was good and it was spacious enough to not feel cramped. The spread was international including indian, Japanese, cheese section, local delights, Malay food, western food, seafood, cold cuts as well as desserts. Started with indian fish tikka and chicken tikka. They were yum. The lamb tikka was a bit hard though. Had lots of sushi and sashimi as well as fresh oyesters, crabs and lobsters. Tried all the variety of cheese followed by grilled black pepper lobster as well as all indian curries. Finished with cakes as well as sorbets. Wonderful experience with warm service.
5
Went for the all you can eat, all you can drink buffet for about sgd 100. Huge variety of food, some good, some exceptional. The highlight was the waiting staff who really matched the mood of our group of 50, joining the fun whilst still doing their jobs to a high standard.
5
I haven't had the pleasure of attending many Sunday brunches, thanks to early morning starts on Mondays, but this occasion was well-worth the wait!With an incredible selection of sweets and savories, the real show-stopper was the incredible service received from the attentive staff from the moment we walked into the restaurant.The free-flowing Veuve went perfectly with the delicious crab legs - the best I've ever eaten, and there were choices of several varieties! The hotel decor is stunning, which I wish was more visible in the restaurant that appeared a little more casual, but that would be my only complaint.I will definitely go again.
5
My family came here for a birthday celebration. We had dinner buffet. The first time we came here for lunch buffet. We prefer the lunch on the weekends than dinner on weekdays. Service is very good and we especially like their homemade yogurt. And the cakes are very delicious too
3
Wide variety of food to select from and on the whole quality was very good. Good service too. Let down one time when strand of hair found in food.....some may argue it's a one-off, but once is enough as far as I'm concerned. Do hope it's an isolated issue
2
we had dinner and we are looking forward for the whole suckling pig on the rotisserie, Maine lobster and claw, Jonah crab claw, snow crab and spanner crab UNFORTUNATE;Y WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE THE SUCKLING PIG IN WHICH THE CHEF INFORMED US "WE CAN ONLY HAVE LAMB CHOP AND WELL-DONE GRILLED BEEF.." Is that what you call "Melt Café signature outdoor barbecue grill" to choose from? what they have indicated on their website menu considering its saturday night, we had 3pcs of maine lobster and it took us 10mins to wait ( we've ask 4X's)as well as we informed the chef if they could replenish all the seafood unfortunately only the crab claw and prawns can only bee offered, they never give any reason though I ask the chef were are the variety of crab. I noticed the Chinese manager offer bunch of lobster personally served to our opposite table though we had been asking to replenish their seafood buffet. live seafood pasta station? its included on their buffet menu but sad to say, they can only offer mee siam!Made to order waffle? I was informed by the chef in high tone "we don't do waffle!"We heard a lot of very good feedback from our friends regarding their variety of food unfortunately they failed to satisfy us.we ask for sprite and it took us 25min to wait and follow-up to the service staff 4X.. my goodness considering they were not that busy.the birthday cake that was served by the manager in a manner he was in hurry, light th candle in front and DROP the cake, greet HBD and turn his back. you can really feel the negative attitude of professionalism.the only satisfaction that made us smile during was ambience, crispy fired fish skin and our wine..I hope they would react immediately before its too late
4
I have attended many business functions in the hotel and almost always had lunch at MELT. The spread is overwhelming in a great way. There are Indian, Japanese and Chinese that I always overeat. I highly recommend visitors for a taste of the variety of different ethnic dishes Singapore has to offer
5
great food and absolutely impeccable service .there is so much food to choose from . seafood, salads, barbecue, western dishes, indian dishes, Chinese dishes, Japanese food to name but a few. it is a super environment to eat and the service is really second to none . my favourite sunday brunch buffet in Singapor
5
Went for Lunch Buffet. What a fabulous spread!! Indian, Far Eastern and Med foods. Also great spread of Sushi. Good spread of sweets and Cheese to end your meal.
5
We don't usually go to restaurants with buffet style service for dinner, but this is an excellent hotel café. The restaurant is staffed by enthusiastic and helpful staff and the buffet offering, especially seafood, is extensive.
5
I made a reservation via Chope,Mandarin oriental Melt cafe emailed me the next day to confirm my booking and asked if I was celebrating any occasion.I mentioned I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and they noted it down serving a complimentary cake to us after lunch. Excellent service
5
By chance we decided to go for Sunday brunch due to over slept and missed breakfast. Once find in it was no mistake to chose it here. If ppl like seafood and consume a lot of alcohol must try this brunch. Selection of drinks are fantastic. Numbers of variety of food also a lot of choices from appetizer to dessert.Highly recommend to have great brunch on Sunday here!
5
My last visit was in Nov 15, and I always miss its food. I am happy to come here again. The food quality and variety were still excellent. My friend usually does not eat fruit during breakfast, but their fresh outlook attracted her to try. In fact, they were really fresh and sweet. Ice-cream with special flavor were provided in that period. Besides, there were other food with extra-ordinary quality. For example, we do not like normal orange jam, but the one in Melt was special, really delicious. The yogurt table was also a heaven to yogurt lovers. About hot dishes, I like potatoes dishes the most, good texture, rich potato taste.This was the first time my friend came here, and she was also very satisfied with the food. The quality of my favorite pancake was still good, but unfortunately, too many pieces were prepared at once, that made the pancakes stay on plate for long time; they became cool and a little bit dry. As a whole, Melt is still my favorite restaurant for breakfast, hope to come back soon
5
The cafe is the place were breakfast is served, the menu is extensive and you are spoilt for choice. Staff are very attentive, a very attentive staff and make sure you have everything you need. Didn't have any other meals there.
5
We were seated at Table 17 on 4 June 2016 and our server was the most attentive server you can ask for, given that the area we were seated in was pretty full. He offers to clear our plates once we are done and even tops up our juices where at other restaurants you have to do so yourself and wave half a day for someone to clear your plate during a busy lunch service. As we were celebrating a close friend's birthday, the advance confirmation with the reservation staff allowed us to communicate on this special occasion and a complimentary birthday cake was arranged. We will definitely be back again
5
This was my first time at Melt, but is a place I rave about! The food was incredible with an amazing selection of seafood - namely the Alaskan crab legs which I couldn't get enough of!! The staff always ensured your glass was topped up with delicious Veuve and I left there feeling amazingly full and tiddly. Best brunch in Singapore!! Can't wait to go back!
4
Had breakfast at Melt. While a am amazed and impressed by the selection available in their buffet, I am a person of relatively simple breakfast requirements. Therefore paying the standard price tag for some muesli and coffee was not a good start to the day. My colleagues however, who sampled a wider selection were very impressed
5
Amazing place and reasonable price. Service was excellent even the Chef very helpful. We dine during Indian promotion the food was good. Meet our espectatation in overall.

Celebrated my parent's wedding anniversary and sister's birthday at the Melt Dinner Buffet. Was met with impeccable service right from the start, as we were greeted at the entrance and entertained throughout dinner. The staff were friendly and prompt in serving us. The buffet spread was amazing just like we've heard so much of. The bbq grill had delicious & perfectly cooked beef and lamb, the cold seafood selection was excellent (particularly oysters, lobsters and snow crab legs), wonderful spread of indian cuisine (briyani rice, mutton curry, potato curries and paneer were mouth watering) and the desserts enticing (mainly the crepe, fruits & fruit juice section). Sashimi & sushi section was not as impressive compared to the rest of the buffet line. There were other hot foods (lobster laksa, roast meats, western dishes) which we just didnt have enough space in our tummies for. The overall ambience and quality of food definitely warrants a repeat visit in the near future
4
Good food: lots of varieties Great ambience: very comfortable Excellent service: do not need to be prompted Great value: food being replenished very often
5
We have been testing the 5 star breakfast buffets in Singapore and Melt must be in the top 3 for sure, if not the best.The service was impeccable and second to none for a breakfast buffet in SGP.Food selection was great, not the largest in town, but more importantly almost everything I tasted was good. Enjo
3
Standard has dropped. There used to be juices available which is gone now. Food variety not as wide as before. Their popular waffle at the dessert counter is no longer available too. Their recent renovation, while appeared brighter, with some changes to the dessert area, seemed to have led to a drop in food standard and variety, unfortunately. I'll probably go to other buffets in the vicinity instead (e.g. Edge at Pan Pacific, Colony at Ritz Carlton
5
We loved the dinner buffet. Yes, it's pricey, but it's a good treat once in a while. The spread is huge, and we were pleasantly surprised by the North Indian cuisine section. The curries were so yums! There was an impressive array of desserts as well, and the sweet toothed me was simply delighted. Hope to return again soon
4
We went along with our children and out of town guest. The food deletion was very good. The service was excellent. The only negative comment I have is that we booked this based on the fact that we where advised they had a play room for the kids. Which they didn't they had face painter/balloon making and a table for colouring in. Better than nothing but should have been advised. However Kids where still entertained. Food was great couldn't complain. Would go back and recommend. We sat inside but there is an outside area. There is also a slightly enclosed area if you are having a bigger group. It would be idea to book on that side.
5
Everything about this restaurant is perfect. The breakfast buffet and dinner buffet are plentiful and the food absolutely delicious.However what really made this restaurant special for our family was the lovely and attentive staff. The smiles and service were more than you could ask and everyone remembered us, they even remembered how we liked our coffee, and the wine we preferred. The staff were so nice to our children that it was almost sad to say goodbye. Mr Anshul Pathania the restaurant manager must be very proud of the professional,warm and generous staff he has working at the restaurant.
5
Lavish spread for breakfast - breakfast finishes at 10-30 am so for those still on India time, its easy to run out of time. Lunch spread is also lavish. Decent vegetarian options too. I particularly enjoyed the sashimi at the lunch buffet
4
So the seafood spread is already amazing with oysters, crayfish, prawns, crab and a little bit of sashimi. Laksa was kinda strange. They also had Indian and Chinese food. They have the ice cream with mixed in ingredients and a big cheese spread. Not cheap though.
3
lots of choices, good fruit and pastry selection but overall disappointing. food taste just ok. the best thing are the staff. very attentive.

Visited on 9th April for a Saturday lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the selection and quality. Melt was somewhere I have never been before even after the many other buffets I have visited around Singapore in different hotel.The buffet served has upmost quality with a great variety presented. Seafood on ice included lobster and one particular favourite of mine was the Boston Lobster Laksa, Macrons and the freshly made milkshakes. Although one thing to point out was that the beef carving was not very tasty and not very good. Comments were made through out our family so it can't just be me. Other than that, I can't find much fault in the buffet. I shall let the pictures speak for themself.One thing that stands out here I might add was the service, most buffet restaurant are plain and simple, with the server doing his job of just clearing plates and topping off water. However, here at Melt, our server, Ganesan was friendly and striked a conversation with us. Kudos to him and the team that supports him.I look forward to coming back as this buffet has great selection of food and quality is the key in a buffet, not quantity. Would definitely recommend this to friends and family
5
...I'll make an exception for Melt.I used to see that Melt featured quite highly in the Tripadvisor restaurant list for Singapore, and I was pretty bemused. How good can a buffet possibly be? The answer is very good indeed. Here's the bottom line: the range is fantastic, the quality (for a buffet) is very good, and the service is everything you'd expect at the Mandarin Oriental. What's more the price is very reasonable at $88 (plus taxes) per person for dinner. Just make sure you skip lunch
5
My husband took me here for our 2years Wedding Anniversary. We had read previous reviews and they were definitely true! The fresh seafood, curries and chocolate cake were to die for. Thanks so much to Ameya and Javed for making our day so special.
3
Compared to the much larger buffet at Edge in the nearby Pan Pacific I think this is over rated. Yes the food is good but not as extensive range of food, and it is much more expensive (wine, for instance, is $120 for an Australian Shiraz, compared to $90 at Edge). The experience was pleasant but I am unlikely to return.
5
First experience and couldn't fault the food or the service. Simply amazing ! A great evening thanks for your hospitality
5
We arrived tired and late but with a reservation for this Cafe. We thought we would grab a sandwich only to enter a paradise. Here was a full buffet to end all buffets. Each region of the world had food set up at separate stations. Very often buffets are soggy tasteless events - this one was not. Probably the best we have had any where in the world with each station more tasty than the other. If you love shellfish even better - fresh lobsters, crab, scallop, mussels etc were replenished every 15 minutes and cooked to perfection. We loved this place and is an absolute must - moreover each thing I brought to my table was checked to be gluten free and could be made without gluten if necessary - rush here it is an amazing experience
5
My wife and I had excellent experience on our many staycations there to celebrate our birthdays or our wedding anniversaries, even when not staying there, we would go back pretty often to have our lunch or dinner at Melt Cafe. Reason is very simple, for the greatest food and the even greater staff. Anshul who is the manager of Melt Cafe manages the restaurant excellently, his assistant manager, supervisor, his team especially Wai Meng are all always on the look out to take extra care of all guests. Every time we are back there, they never fail to impress us further and much much better than each previous time. They are always improving. Foo is also great, they are truly THE BEST restaurant in Singapore. Excellent place to have lunch and dinner or even celebration. They simply know how to make your time there and enjoyable one. It is definitely worth it. Lots of paring space and convenient even if u take bus or mrt there as the stations there served the red, green, yellow and blue lines
4
We enjoyed the Turkish specials but we were disappointed with the lobster, crabs and prawn as they did not taste good or fresh, perhaps they were overcooked? We don't normally go for dinner buffets but we had certificates. We know we could easily get an excellent dinner elsewhere in Singapore for the same or lesser price
5
A wonderful dining experience, with a mouth watering display of food combined with excellent service. We were in a group of four and opted for the lunchtime buffet. There was a seemlesly endless selection of food from varying continents, My husband was blown away by the crab pate... And the deserts?...An amazing selection of deserts and I mean amazing!!! Everything was relaxed and friendly and the staff discreet but attentive. Wonderful and well worth a visit
5
We came for a la carte but found ourselves indulged in Dinner buffet delicacies. The ambience, food,service everything was perfect. Apart from buffet options ,we ordered few Chef specialities as well and were equally amazed. Special thanks to Javed for making our evening memorable by his attention and service. Will come back for sure
5
The variety of foods available here is ridiculous. Excellent quality and value. So good it dampens enthusiasm to explore outside. Friendly, attentive staff. Every time I come to Singapore I make a point of dining here for lunch.
5
We came for a la carte but found ourselves indulged in buffet delicacies. It had amazing collection of indian dishes with some delicious desserts. Special thanks to Javed for taking care of all our needs throughout the evening. Will come back for sure
5
Everything is perfect about this restaurant. The food, the ambience and the service. We had the dinner buffet and ordered some chef specialities including Chef Santosh's vegetable biryani which was a classic delight. Desserts were mouth-watering and also had couple of glasses of fine italian wine. Will strongly recommend a visit for foodies
5
A quite exceptional buffet at both lunch and dinner - reasonably priced for what it is. Virtually every style of food you could wish for from seafood to Asian and fusion.
5
Cannot say enough about the buffet! We came in for a la carte, but ended up indulging in this amazing variety of food in buffet. Great starters with sushi corner, salad bar and breads. Then 4 sets of main course buffet, including Indian, western, Singaporean and Asian specialties. The dessert is a sinful pleasure, so do not hesitate to try their crepe with vanilla syrup and ice cream. The staff is brilliant! Special mention to Jo and Giruba, who were taking so much care of us! Bravo
4
We were very excited to try a buffet in Singapore and researched and compared a few of the best including raffles and Marina Bay to name a few, but we decided on the Melt.We were very pleased on a whole with experience, lovely ambience, food is fresh and delicious plenty to choose from my favourite the fresh sushi master kitchen could've just eaten this station all night and been happy. the currie were very nice and the lobster, prawns seafood was a treat. We budget for $180 for a couple all included, but were shocked to be billed for the bottled mineral water at $15 each and we had two. This left bit disappointed as the waiter should have informed us of the extra fee, rather than offer to pour into our glasses as we sat down thinking it was part of deal. Next time in Singapore I will try another buffet as while this was lovely, perfect service, beautiful hotel and food delicious it was a little under my expectations 
5
We dined here in February and thoroughly enjoyed the evening buffet. We had a lovely table outside. There was a wide selection of food available and the sushi and seafood sections were incredible. There is also an outside BBQ where you can have grilled meats and seafood. The service was fantastic and the staff were super friendly and attentive to all our needs. This is a truly wonderful buffet in a beautiful hotel and well worth a visit
4
I went there at 12 pm ,as a hotel club guest.I had previously clicked booking of 1 person at MELT as STAY Enchancement in addition to my 1 nite stay at hotel Oriental Club room.Wide spread of buffet with large groupa in one station featured Chinese food and another 1 large salmon in another station featuring Japanese sashimi, etc.One thing : BBQ station was located outside this buffet restaurant. If there is rain, guests willl have difficultly take BBQ food, eg. chicken , beef.I get a glass of champagne and a glass of cocktail.There is a mini buffet for little kids where there is a small table, and chair meant for them.Overall, it is a nice buffet restaurant, worth $186 (inclusive of GST and service charge
4
Melt does exactly what it says in the name - a fusion of world cuisine served in buffet or a la carte format. A little expensive but then this is Singapore. Excellent service
5
The buffet at he Melt Cafe is as usual very well laid out and the family always enjoys the food and servi
5
My wife recommended this place for our wedding anniversary dinner because she's heard rave reviews about the food! When we reached the restaurant, I was struck at the lovely ambience and decor. It really looked so exquisite. We were both impressed. We then decided to get some grub into us because we were ravenous from all that waiting, just to try out Melt's buffet spread. They had food, ranging from seafood, chicken, beef, lamb, Chinese, Indian, Western, Mediterranean, etc. They also had their outdoor bbq running since it was the Lunar New Year. The wait staff were excellent jn recommending what to start with as well as very polite and accommodating to our needs. Not only that, they were concerned about my bum knee and I greatly appreciated the gesture. Moving onto dessert, it was my wife's perfect fantasy. Their dessert range would satisfy every kind of sweet-tooth imaginable. I had to take a quick break from all that gorging because I was eating till my stomach could hold no more. When I got back to my table, I pleasantly surprised to see a cake dedicated to us for your wedding anniversary. That was sincerely the highlight the evening. When we left, we left with a smile on our faces. Now that's is the perfect way to end any evening. Will definitely come here again and will surely recommend more people to try this place out. Expectations of restaurant, met with success!Expectations of food quality/range, excellent! 10/10 will come again.
5
My friend and I have been so lucky to eat here on the same day the restaurant was opened after renovation. I was very fascinated by the outstanding and unforgettable choice of Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisine, the fresh juices and the tasty ad beautifully home made desserts. I loved the atmosphere here and the warm welcome of the super professional and friendly Mr. Jan Imhoff who talked with us sharing some of his hospitality experience. The restaurant Manager Anshul Pathania was also very welcoming and pleasant to talk to. They are doing a wonderful job, delivering an amazing service. Must do in Singapore;)
5
First, I have to say I do not like buffets but if they were all as good as Melt I would feel differently about them. I cannot say enough good things about the service. The staff here are attentive and eager to assist and yes it is a buffet. We dined for breakfast and dinner. For each there is a wonderful, large selection of items to select from which are consistently kept hot (or cold) and fresh. Breakfast included beautiful fruit and pastry selections, traditional Indian, Japanese, English, and Chinese cuisine. Freshly made Belgian waffles, pancakes and omelets were also available. For dinner there were chilled fresh crab legs, lobster, shrimp, sushi and again a wide selection of various cultural cuisines. The reason I do not usually like buffets is many times quantity overcomes quality but in this case not so. This was truly a delicious experience

Nice ambient. Must try out Lobster laksa and chocolate cake. Awesome! Sashimi is 'on demand', they will serve out individual plates. Great company, great food

Buffet lunch at Melt was part of our seminar package. What we were looking forward to, turned out below expectation in terms of food quality, variety and service on both days. I had a salad for two days in a row, both times the leaves were limp and tasted like they had been left out for a some time. I ordered a coffee and the staff taking my order did not make any eye contact or acknowledge my order. This gave me the impression that he could not be bothered with me. I have had many wonderful meals at Melt in the past, it is a pity that standards appear to have been compromised in these areas. Overall the ambience is still nice.
4
Melt is the best ! After trying the breakfast of another five star hotels with good comment, I realize that I cannot find another one to replace Melt. Same as last year, their breakfast still be one of the highlight of my Singapore trip. I was delighted to find that their standard can be kept. The pancake, Kaya, special juices were so delicious that made me ate a lot.Besides, I was happy to meet the attendant Wai Meng that served me last year, She was still friendly and able to provide hearty excellent service. Hope to see her next time

The spread included western, Indian, Chinese and Japanese food but the choices were limited for each type. There were only two types of sushi and some sashimi on the Japanese table. The Chinese dishes were not appetising as they looked thick and gluey. There were more choices from the seafood table but they ran out quickly and were not replaced immediately. Desserts too had not much variety. They only section worth mentioning was the barbecue section but it was situated outdoors and easily missed. It was also not accessible by wheelchair. For such a price, we felt we had better choice in Singapore
5
It's a very great place for gathering with friends or family... Nice food, ambience and friendly staffs, especially this guy by the name of Javed, he helped us a lot on the night... Will definitely be back for more!! :

Have been to Melt for the Christmas eve buffet and the food, the variety and ambience were excellent. For SGD 250 per head there was unlimited access to drinks (wine, beer, juices, etc) and a multitude of cuisines from European to Indian to Japanese and more. Lobsters, curries, breads, cheeses and a huge range of desserts. We sat for over 2.5 hours, listening to Christmas carols and enjoying the delicious food. The place is highly recommended for the value of what you get, including very friendly and helpful staff, who serve with a smile. Well done Melt
5
We had dinner on the 21st of December. The food was amazing. Wide variety of food. The barbecue was amazing. The Chef (Chef Vinny) we spoke to was very helpful in introducing the types of food available. We especially enjoyed the local selection. The black pepper crab is one of the best we had in a long while. Unfortunately, the waiters were slow in attending to us when we needed water and calling for the bill was a hassle. The atmosphere was very festive and joyous. Overall a very good experience dining and I would definitely come back one day
5
We have dined many times at Melt over the years and are consistently impressed by the food and service.The staff cannot do enough for you and make you feel important. The buffet is one of the best in Singapore and the food is amazing. Lots of variety. We have also ordered off the a la carte menu which is superb. Large serves and amazing food.Highly recommend this. Very good for special occasions too
5
Amazing variety and quality. One of the best that I've seen anywhere in all my travels. Only miss is the coffee, otherwise the food options and spot on. Not a breakfast for when you're in a rush - take your time to try all the different cuisines!
5
Highly recommended to try the food here. One of the best buffet spreads I've had. The Indian food was authentic and nice. All the staff I met were courteous and clean. Thanks for the great experience. Worth the price
5
We had a company annual dinner last Friday and was told that they are serving special menu for grilled steak, satay, lobsters and etc even thought the queue was quite long. The selections of the cuisines are plenty and nevertheless in quality. As for the dessert, there are plenty of hand-crafted tiny dessert which make you want to have a bite of them by looking at them. Overall, the food quality and decoration are certainly good despite of the kinda poor service as in like the response time is slow and inefficient. We had the 138++ package with the freeflow of beer, wine and juices but then eventually when we requested to have juices to clear the heavy food taste in our mouth, we've been informed we need to pay extra for the fresh squeeze juices which wasn't what we've been told in the first place.Anyhow, if you're looking for great food with higher budget, this is certainly a great place to go for, however, don't expect a warm and prompt service over there though

Singapore seems to be a city with lots of places which offer buffets. We chose Melt located in 5-star Mandarin Oriental hotel. I made a reservation via their online system which was easy - however, I afterwards sends some questions via email which were never answered. Not a good start.The buffet itself was tasty and good - not so much variety as perhaps in some other places but still plenty to choose from. The only downside regarding the food was that seafood station emptied very quickly from lobsters and oysters and it took too long time before they were replenished.Service overall was polite (as you would expect from MO). Although overall enjoyable experience I am not sure for the value for money - we had free flow of wines with the weekday buffet which totaled the bill for two SGD 204 + 17 % tax
3
The price was S$88++ and is quite acceptable. However, the spread of food was not so great after all especially too many Indian cuisines included. Service is average but ambiance is good
5
The food is well presented and delicious. The variety choice of food is what I like. The service from staffs in the Cafe is good. I am very impressed by the excellent and attentive services provided by attendant Wai Meng. When you sit by the garden side in the beautiful early morning for breakfast, the gentle breeze is blowing. It is really relaxing and enjoyable.

Last Friday (4 Dec) we went to Melt the World restaurant for my daughter's birthday celebration. It's the worst experience we had. When I made my reservation it was already fully booked and was placed on the wait list. After a few days they finally called me and told me I had a table but it will be at the entrance of the restaurant. When we reached there, we were given a table at the foyer near the toilet . It was a long walk to get our food from the buffet spread. I believed there was a company event as they were distributing door gifts at the entrance. It was very very crowded, you can imagine it's like queuing up food in a crowded canteen. Food was replenished very slowly. The BBQ station was perpetually long queue. When it's our turn, we were told we were restricted to only 2 sausages by some rude staff ! I see no difference than eating in a workplace cafeteria. We have been to many buffet restaurants and this is the worst experience we had had. The restaurant was obviously overbooked, and they are still accepting reservation. It's not worth paying $88++ for this kind of ambience, food and service 
4
Looking at a high end hotel, with a high-end buffet spread, I must say this was worth the money. With an array of dishes, the food selections were delicious and definitely above average expectation. Staffs were friendly and always wearing a smile on their faces, and very efficient on cleaning up your dishes after every meal you had. There was a great selection of Indian Food, with undoubtedly the best prawn curry I had. Western food selections were great as well with their thick and creamy clam chowder. Cold dishes were fine too with a great selection of crayfish, lobsters and prawns. Overall, it was definitely worth a visit and me and my partner will definitely make a trip down here again
5
The restaurant offers a wide range of food selection from meat, seafood, Japanese, oriental and a specialized egg station where they'll cook it for you on the spot. They also have very accommodating staff.
5
Loved this restaurant when we were staying at the Mandarin Oriental. The selection of food here is huge, and all cooked to perfection. We ate breakfast here every day and usually skipped lunch because we were so full. Like everything else at th Mandarin Oriental, but it was superb
3
Went to this place to eat thinking it was rated as top few buffet in town. But to my disappointment, the lobsters and oyster is very small in size. Oyster always running out. Fruits were not sweet. Overall, it's not worth the price
5
Will definitely come again. Just a little disappointed there were no oysters the day I visited. But overall the food was great and very good service too.
3
Expected more from a mandarin oriental for breakfast. Staff were friendly and the juice of beet, orange and carrot very tasty. The food was just not great. Dim sum just bland, the noodle station also not up to mark. The Indian food was ok. Belgian waffles were good. Overall they need to look at the menu and make some change
5
We had the Sunday brunch with free flow champage @Melt Cafe. The food & beverage choice is very broad and the quality of the products is just absolutely awesome. The champagne served with the brunch can come in Classic or Rose flavor of the Veuve Cliquot and everything in unlimited version! Definitely recommende
5
Joined the bed and breakfast package. The staff service was flawless, always cheerful and with heart. I know that should be expected in a five star hotel, but you just feel very welcome everytime they greeted you (and my father) with your last name. Even when they're busy serving others, when they saw you left, they never forgot to say goodbye. Exemplary service.Food wise, you never had enough of those bacon and eggs. What better way to start your day with such service and food. Hainanese chicken in the afternoon was also a treat. It's this place that makes me love the MO more
3
We first tried this restaurant few years ago, and thought the food was very good, so we came back this year taking our friend with us. We were little disappointed. The seafood as OK, seems very dried to us, and the buffet had lots of selection, however mostly indian. We tried the roast beef, and it was very good, so I came back for second, since they only gave me few small pieces the first time, and the second time, the beef was so tough, I couldn't eat it. The ambiance is good
4
Business Breakfast with work colleagues at Melt. Big buffet with lots of healthy options - soy milk, variety of fruits and low carb options
5
Good food, atmosphere and company!:)There is 15% off for citi/hsbc credit cards too! I would definitely come back again:)
4
Had dinner with my colleagues - excellent service and a wide selection of dishes. Love the lamb from the BBQ section snd the prawn from the seafood section.
5
We always spend important occasions here. The buffet spread is sumptuous and everything tastes good for me! My fave is the cold seafoods table, especially the lobster, which is almost always empty. So be sure to watch out when they re-fill it and be on your guard to get to it first! Lol! They a give small cake with written message ("Happy Birthday/ Happy Anniversary") if you're celebrating a special event. The staff are always attentive, courteous and always ready to lend their service whenever needed. Every visit to this restaurant is satisfyingly remarkable
4
High class environment expected at Marina area, there are quite a lot of food variety. Personally think is slightly expensive for lunch. But you are holding UOB Credit card, there is a promotion of 1 pax free with 3 paying adults.
4
We were there for my spouse's birthday. The buffet spread is really wide, the food tasted great. We were spoilt with choices. There were also live station for BBQ, satays or roasted chicken to select from. In addition to mention, we were pleasantly surprised when the staff offered us a small complimentary cake to celebrate the birthday for my husband. This service melted our heart, just like the restaurant's name Melt - The World Cafe. It was our 1st time dining at the hotel but we were delighted with so much praises about their food, ambience and of course their service. Definitely should try them!!! No regrets. 1st class buffet with world class service standards. Will be back for sure. Thanks Melt!
4
The outdoor grill is interesting and the variety of the food is fantastic. The ambience is great and the staffs are attentive.
4
The spread is quiet big for consumption in one evening. I would say the spread is one of the nicer ones amongst 5 star hotels and the ambience is much nicer than many others
5
Came here with boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary. What I really liked was the good service, and food wise, oysters, roasted duck, spinach mushroom (northern indian), and the delicate desserts. I am most often disappointed by cooked food served in buffets but Melt was good. Though oysters were not filled frequently and flat bread from the indian section was quite chewy
5
WOW after quite a few buffet breakfasts on our journey what a great surprise! The food was amazing the presentation was like something else! So much to choose from catering for all tastes and everything was clean and fresh. The restaurant has a lovely feel especially the outdoor palmed section. Loved it
5
We had the dinner buffet here last week and it was delicious! Many, many food options, plenty of dessert too. All very nice!! Staff and service was wonderful
3
Made reservations in advance and when they called me to ask my preference, i indicated a window corner seat. Upon arrival, they gave us a corner seat but turns out to be too cold as we were seated right under the air-con. We requested a change of table which they gladly obliged. Food variety was alright, although we were quite disappointed by the japanese selection. Sashimi only came in 3 types and were not frequently re-filled by the staff. The only cuisine that stood out was the Indian selection. Also, as we came here for 2 persons' birthday celebration, the staff informed us that they would arrange for 2 birthday cakes but only gave us 1 in the end. When we asked for the 2nd cake, the staff gave us a weird look and again, obliged to gave us the 2nd cake. For the given price of SGD 88 per person, I think there are definitely other buffet places out there that are slightly cheaper yet more value for money. 
5
Had a family buffet lunch there on 12Sept2015 to celebrate a birthday. It's located in Mandarin Oriental Hotel. There were at least 3 other groups next to us who were also celebrating birthdays. The restaurant will present you a small birthday cake with a candle if you inform them in advance. Food is delicious and quality is very high. There is a wide selection from local fare like laksa noodles to Japanese sushi and shashimi, Indian curries, Chinese dishes, roast meats and others. The dessert spread is very wide and you'll be spoilt for choice. There's also fresh fruit and juices, coffee and tea. I believe the more premium items like lobsters are only served for the dinner buffet at a higher price. We only visit once a year for special occasions and make use of credit card promotions like the 'one free for 4 persons' deal
5
I've always been impressed by the wide selection and the quality of breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental. Other than the local specialties, it has a good variety of Continental, Chinese, Indian, Italian, Japanese, and many more delicious sweets & fruits. Talking about sweets, I really like their almond croissant. I have stayed at many great hotels in Singapore, and the breakfast here is the best I've had in town
5
We lucked out to discover that for 10 days Chef Heinz von Holzen would be serving his magical Balinese cuisine here. What a delight! We just loved the specials he curated
5
Food is plentiful and cooked to perfection,breakfast and dinner huge choice and the staff are second to none,vast array of seafoo
4
Went to celebrate our company's anniversary. Spread was more than ample, cold seafood were superbly fresh and always replenished. Cooked food serves all exotic Thai, Asean, Indian and Western food, all taste great. Desserts were plentiful and hearty too.They added in small little touches that warm the hearts of many. We were asked if we were celebrating any occasions when we made a reservation. They presented a small cake with the tag" Happy Anniversary" that ended our celebration with a very warm touch indeed. Birthday cakes were also presented to other guests celebrating some others' birthdays too.No regrets and will be back when there is a next call for celebration
5
Had a great buffet there. Thought it would be a standard meal, but were a amazed by the quality and variety. They also were willing to go off menu for us and bring some specially made dishes.
4
PLENTY of everything. Excellent service. Variety of seating options, inside and out. Come hungry as the buffet is endless.
4
Not bad but it was just alot of food cooked aveage. The staff are great and the selection is good as well. Not sure i would pay for it. I managed to get a voucher.
4
The food was so so the bbq fodd was bad, not much variety... not value for money. The service was good.    
4
The office treated my family and my eldest sister to this restaurant for her birthday on Aug 12. There were a lot of food varieties. There were a lot of seafood, so it was a good bargain for seafood lovers. My eldest sister had tried the tom yam soup and only had one spoon, as she commented that the taste was neither here nor there. I had the winter melon soup which was surprisingly slightly bitter.  There is a lot of items from the noodles bar to choose from- pasta, spaghetti and laksa. I asked to substitute the crab laksa with the prawns, which was really nice. The soup was just nice to the taste. For dessert lovers, you would certainly love the dessert section, where there are a lot of varieties to choose from, and one of the office staff commented that it was so much that he did not really know where to begin with. The restaurant knew that it was my sister's birthday, so provided her with a cake too. As we were by then too full, the staff chose to bring the cake to cut, back in the office. The restaurant was doing a promotion, 4 for the price of 3; so it was really a discount, as 16 staff attended the lunch together
5
Our buffet dinner at Melt is an experience we will remember. The buffet offers a wide range of Asian and Western delicacies, including fresh seafood, Thai food, Italian starters, Indian food. There was also a fantastic selection of deserts such as tropical fruits, French pastries, and local deserts. The service was very friendly and professional. I would strongly recomment the Melt buffet dinner for a festive family meal or for travellers who wish to try out Asian cuisine
5
I was reading some reviews about the 5 best buffets in Asia and i found the Melt and as i was living nearby i decided to go. For europeans like me is very difficult to decide from a chinese menu what to order, so the option buffet is ideal for me. The food there is simply excellent and nothing to do with low quality buffets. Everything we ate was perfect, you can find there sushi, unlimited shrimps, lobsters, and seafood generally. Stuff was very friendly and brought us also a chef's special plate naan with cheese or something like that, actually it was like a pizza with cheese and garlic which was better that pizza. keep some space for dessert...too many choices and waffle for the end...Enjoy i
2
Tried the buffet dinner with my friends.
Quality of food is below average, although the spread is good.
Service is average with the junior staff a little green and the senior staff too busy.
3
Well, buffet in Singapore is not all that cheap so value becomes an important consideration. This place has good reviews so decided to come for my wife's birthday. The dessert station was limited. Although there was the usual chocolate fondue, waffles, a few cakes and Asian dessert/fruits, it was really nothing exceptional.Too much Asian cooked food squeezed onto a corner of the restaurant.Wouldn't consider this place agai
5
I have travelled to many countries.. i never had this type of buffet experience anywhere in the world..really Wide spread..so mannnnnny varities and options in starters , main course and deserts ..and everything tastes good..and the food quality is also very good ..inspite of so many options..each and everything is unique..i really felt like a kings dinner..its just lavish..staffs were amazing..overall a greatest experience ever.
3
The chocolate fondue did not have a supply of fresh strawberries, that was rather disappointing. Seafood could have been better given the price range. Stronger focus on a few choice dishes might yield better results.
4
My wife and I went for dinner buffet. The ambiance was lively and busy. The buffet spread had a wide variety of food and even lobsters and prawn were replenished often. All cuisines were well represented and had the authentic tests. We opted for free flow of wines and even though the choice of wines were limited (the red wine did not come up to standard - so we stayed with a Chilean white); our wines glasses were filled regularly.The grilled section was a bit disappointing. The meats were kept pre-grilled on the counter and were either tough or cold. Service was very good and attentive. The Asst. Manager (Mr Nedumpurath) came over to our table to check on the meal experience and even offered to get a special dessert prepared.The personal touch made the experience even better. I would recommend the restaurant for almost any occasion
5
We went to melt couple of days ago. We took the buffet there. There were 5 cuisine I guess I don't remember food was delicious and service was up to the mark. Best dinner so far in Singapore. A very big thank to service team. Thank you very much. Will be back soon...........
5
We went there with my wife on the last day of our trip to have something special and we were not disappointed. The buffet is elegant, the food delicious and the variety of cuisines incredible. It is worth the price and we took the formula with free flow of beverages and we found it good value for the price paid. Definitely a must do in Singapore. Try to avoid saturdays and sundays, since the price is majorated. A very good deal during week days
3
We were staying in the hotel and was recommended to try the melt. First impression look good, large selection of hot and cold. Very good sushi selection and good choice of shell fish, though lobster was a bit chewy, obviously frozen. The real disappointment was the roast beef, the little sign advertised it as 'Prime rib' what they served was strip loin or sirloin and quality was not good. It was 8.30 at night the restaurant just beginning to get busy I noticed they had roast lacquered duck after a few serving they ran out. Later I called the manager to explain that they can't sell the beef as Prime rib and they are misleading the customer, he opologised and the next day when I dined in there Italian restaurant they gave me a glass of wine 
5
Spread was great! Suits every taste!The entrée dishes have a wide selection from Western cuisine to Indian cuisine and local cuisine.The dessert counter offers excellent waffles with your own topping/sauce/ice cream and plenty of other pastries, tarts and cakes. Cheese board was great as is the fruit selection.This was my 1st visit and hoping to come again soon
5
~if we're celebrating, this is the place to be for a great spread and a sprawling buffet that beats the Line anytime~not a great place to 2 to dine only just because the food is so good but too much to stop yourself from going overboard, so best to bring a group to slowly enjoy the meal~the hostess always asks if it's your first time and will bring you on a tour of the buffet spread and it really does always impress~from the 4th floor, take a walk towards the Bar at Morton's and take a seat outside before 12pm for drinks, the desserts bar's right in front, down the steps to the right is the chef's prep station from the left to the middle is the island of fresh seafood and on the right is the sushi & sashimi bar...~I'm partial to their "keropok" (peppered fish crackers and the prawn cracker is not half bad too)... the other thing I always eat here is the garlic bread slices ... yeah carbs are my favsAnyhow, this buffet will have something for everyone and anyone will have something delicious nosh to nom
5
This buffet had everything for anyone. Well worth going to on a Sat or Sun morning, but will require skipping lunch.
5
so many stations and basically, every food category is covered. Bright clean setting in a fantastic hotel. I really liked the nasi goreng station. The ham and bacon station were excellent too.
5
Top quality buffet. Great family destination. Food from around the world. Good service and tasty food. Expensive so only for special occasions.
5
A friend spoilt me by taking me as her guest for the Sunday Brunch,,,,,,Warning.....don't have breakfast ......The service by our deligated wait person, faultless, we never had a empty glass,,,Vive Cliquo Champers, Cocktails, select beers....all, included in the set cost. I am sure my friend ate the entire stock of oysters ,,,there was crab, crayfish, curries, salads , just to name a few items of the menu, cheeses, ice creams, cakes, deserts, and,,,your never empty glass of what you were drinking....yes, a little expensive but not breaking the bank....a nice way to treat yourself and someone special on Sunda
5
Great hospitality with the Melt cafe, wonderful job. Excellent service from Anshul and Claire. Food was amazing and hardly to tried all. Too much variety to choose on. Amazing personal service from Emmanuel and Wai meng that serve me, my long waited oyster. My dirty plate was clear promptly, Claire was attentive to our needs. Homemade waffles was great. Same goes with the gelato. Wide selection of seafood and I have the best fresh naan in the world specially made by vickesh. Great dining experience from Melt The world cafe
5
One of my favourite buffet places in Singapore. I love buffets but I don't like the feel of the place being chaotic, crowded and unorganised. but with Melt, From the moment you step in at this restaurant, you will feel how cozy the place is. From the lights, furnitures and specially the food. There may not be as many variety of dishes as other buffet places here but you know there is quality on everything they serve. Maybe that's why I have not found any buffet restaurant yet that will topple Melt on top of my list. Only one thing though, they don't always serve their pistachio Ice cream which is really good
5
Firstly , it is not cheap. it is a buffet , but what a buffet.The food selection is very extensive , my wife is a seafood lover , which is why we went. It is not possible to say what they had there , probably everything, but they also had a BBQ chef who did BBQ seafood , which went down well.The service was very friendly but very efficient and non intrusive. I know its a buffet but where else can you take a lady (or anybody ) and treat them to a hundred course( or more ) meal with such attentive servic
4
Stayed at hotel for business conference for full week had all breakfasts and lunches here. The buffet has a very wide variety of dishes (Thai, Japanese, Indian, Western, Chinese, Italian pastas). Each was done to varying degrees. Well stocked and varied dessert and fruit, fresh juices every single morning. Not one dish really stood out, but the selection is fantastic
5
In May 2015, we held our solemnisation (20 pax) in the garden just next to the dining room, then we invited an additional 30+ family and friends to join us right after for the buffet. We chose this unusual arrangement (vs the typical Chinese banquet setting) because we wanted something less formal and thought a buffet would please everyone. Restaurant Manager Anshul, assisted by his team (special mention to Wai Meng) stopped at nothing to ensure the success of our event, from start to finish. Our guests noticed how pampered we were (not just the newlyweds but the whole wedding party), and were quite impressed. My husband and I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Melt, Manager Anshul and his team as they exceeded our high expectations
4
Still one of my favourite buffet place. We were there for lunch. Have been going there for the last few years. Quality of food has been consistent. Spread of food is good. With Japanese, Thai, Indian, Western and Chinese. The Indian section is always a delight. Liked the grilled fish and the curry section. Towards the end of the meal, the server brought us some cheese naan to try. At first I was quite full and thought we probably couldn't finish. However, the moment I tried, couldn't stop. It was really good! Service has always been consistent and good. Is always a delight dining here. Still one of my favourites.
5
Excellent service and a wide variety of choises. Breakfast especially is very impressive.
Could sit either outside or inside
4
we eat twice at the Melt restaurant and both times we were happy and satisfied with the quality of the food (the children loved the dessert buffet) and the service is like always perfect.
4
My mum and I visited Melt for Sunday brunch. The staff were friendly,welcoming and unobtrusively attentive... There was an extensive buffet spread and we were absolutely spoilt for choice...This is definitely a must visit for buffet lovers :)
4
Service was excellent. Had a dinner somewhere last month, with my friends. Aina was assigned to taking care of our table. We were seated and greeted. Buffet spread was good. BarberQ at outdoor area. However I notice half way through the dinner there was some drizzling via the route to the barberQ pit. They did provide umbrella for the diners convenience. But it would be great if they have a permanent sheltered route the the barberQ area.Aina notice that I could not take alcohol, she served me their Balinese tea instead. Great move on that.Plates was cleared promptly. Every time when I pick my, when I returned my table is always clean.Food was good. But the live station pasta disappoint me. Alio olio was too spicy and the salt is uneven. Very bad experience on the pasta chef.Belgium Wafer is a must try item there.
5
I only had my breakfasts there, but I was impressed by the wide variety of food that you can get for breakfast.- Several dishes per world regions (US, Asia, etc.)- There is a cook for omelettes where you choose your ingredients- Dim sum items- Yougourt, cheese, cold meat cuts- Bread bar (croissants, bagel, etc)- Fruit bar- Coffee/tea service (cofee was very good)....and more...
5
Go hungry! Monster buffet from all countries. The American table had three types of sausage, two types of bacon and honey roasted ham, eggs as you like them inlets too. Want dim sum for breskfast, Malasyan, Indonesian or Japanese breakfasts no problem. Belgian Waffles or griddle cakes? How many and with 8 different toppings. An entire counter of tropical fruits for the diet conscience. An attentive staff clearing plates and offering tea or coffee before your cup is empt
4
The food was quite good but not outstanding. Nevertheless, my friends and I had a lovely time as the service was very attentive. The understated and elegant decor and the well spaced out tables also scored points with us. In fact, every hotel staff we met on the way greeted us, which added to our positive impression
3
I don't understand why this place was included in the top 10 best buffets in singapore.. Their spread was nothing out of the ordinary..dessert choices are limited and not appetizing their presentation needs improvement... the only thing good here was the seafood stew with plenty of shrimps and mussels.
5
What a wonderful start to our stay at the Mandarin Oriental. After an overnight flight, we came in with tired and hungry teen boys. They enjoyed trying the amazing variety and we were most impressed with the quality of service and food. Even though the restaurant was full, every station was replenished quickly, everything was at the proper temperature (often hard to accomplish at buffets with high turnover), and we were well cared for with personal service from drinks to advice on local dishes. The local noodle soup with lobster was amazing. Everyone we came in contact with was warm and helpful. We are looking forward to returning again
5
A group of 10 went for a buffet on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was quieter than expected but good for us. The staff were very attentive and very subtle with their service. There was such a variety of food which was all out of this world. The sea food was fantastic. The curries from India and Thailand were also amazing. The in house made chocolate ice cream can't be missed. I just wish I hadn't eaten so much as I struggled to walk home....Would highly recommend
4
Service perfect. Food variety is very good. Food quality just good. Premises average. Worth it if you are staying at the hotel.
5
The food was exceptional and service provided outstanding. This venue is now our benchmark for any future venues we will be utilising.
5
Great seafood selection. Really good salmon sashimi, awesome desserts both variety wise as well as preparation wise. Even otherwise the food variety is great.
Service is really good. Extremely attentive and prompt service.
Highly recommended..
5
We love this restaurant having stayed at this Hotel for many years on our frequent visits to Singapore. All staff greet us as we arrive for our breakfast/dinner as members of "the family" the majority of staff are long term employees and this helps with service.We find the food wonderful and so varied from seafood through to sushi etc. Magnificent food and service. You must try it if you are around the Raffles area
4
Chose this venue based on mostly positive reviews. The entrance into the restaurant was promising: the soaring heights of the foyer of the Mandarin Oriental provide a suitably impressive beginning. The venue is vast - multiple counters spread over the seating area, each serving a take on different cuisines. Available were Indian, Chinese, Singapore "hawker" favourites, Japanese with the ubiquitous suishi / sashimi, "international" with salads, cheese selection, shellfish and seafood, European (well, Italian, really, with pizza and pasta) and a carvery/roast section. The dessert section was tucked away at the rear. Coffee and tea were offered, served to the table, while water on tap was offered as standard. This would really be the best venue to cater to a party with widely differing tastes, as I think you could safely accommodate all fussy eaters with the choice available. The venue filled out as the evening progressed, but you never felt cramped or overly congested. The worse seating was probably the overflow tables set out in the "balcony/corridor" area, while some very comfortable "sofa-type" tables looked tempting..(if possibly a bit impractical). Service was relatively attentive, with used crockery generally removed quickly. Service at food counters was generally prompt, if a bit impersonal.Overall, the venue and ambience was good for large parties. The quality of food was good for the variety on offer, but realistically, you would get a better standard of food if you went for a speciality a-la-carte restaurant. Prices were high with minimal discount, but a car-parking voucher was offered at the end. Nonetheless, a pleasant enough evening

I'm not particularly a fan of buffets but this is different. I had breakfast at Melt and it was delicious. They had plenty of choices and everything seemed to be really nicely presented (no packaging, everything was on some sort of a plate). There was Malay, Indian, Chinese, Local and International choices. The honey glazed ham was particularly the best thing
5
This place is great for breakfast or lunch especially because of what it offers on the buffet . The seafood and japanese selection is exceptionally good. Its a classy buffet , its not cheap so they have good things on offer , beautiful presentation and classy service . Everything about this space is well done , the decor, the table settings and the ambience . If you want a special lunch are hungry and want to impress this is the place to come 
5
Ate breakfast twice during my stay and, even though it was a buffet, the staff made extra efforts to serve me. Then on the 2nd day, they remembered my name and the server from the previous morning came by to wish me good morning - once again by name. I also ate at the dinner buffet - which was featuring BBQ this night. Besides the BBQ, there was extensive seafood and sushi selections
4
After service charge and GST, each person cost nearly SGD$100. It is international buffet, so will have different types of food. Western, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, India, BBQ and etc... The seafood is fresh but all cold dishes... The service not bad if the walk near you. If they are far away even they saw you calling them they will also try to ignore you. The dessert is nice, cheeses cake is a must try. Overall, 100 is too much.
5
The Sunday Buffett is exceptional ,the amount of different fish is great,the sushi is to die for,fresh salmon enormous ,king size prawns which the staff got topped and tailed when asked.if there was something you wanted the staff tried Their best to provide it for you.It's nice to sit outside where the barbeques is but at times a little to hot.The choice of food from different countries is good, the cheese and deserts unbelievable,and the chocolate fountains and pancakes ,are to die for, yummy yummy.The staff are always there to help or bring your food to the table,which is nice. You can guarantee you won't want to eat again that day
5
Just used for breakfast, great variety of foods to sustain any palate. Excellent service and a wonderful way to start the day.
4
I had dinner at Melt. The buffet was nice with a good selection. The food was good but not as nice as expected for the Mandarin Oriental. The service was very good and the staff was excellent.
3
Good service but at 54 sing dollars it's not worth it. Go to the shopping mall next to it through the interior stairway and have all your meals for this price not just breakfast and you won't melt away.
4
You can skip lunch having breakfast here with spread consisting of cold cuts, lots of meat, rice, noodles, porridge, desserts...nicely cooked and laid out for your pick.
5
Spread across five different stations, it is a breakfast to die for--or go right back to sleep after overeating. About S$50 per person so not inexpensive but go very hungry or feel guilty. Amazing choices and very good service.
5
Fantastic daily breakfast buffet which really set us up for the day. We ate there the evening we arrived and felt that we'd had a gastronomic adventure from around the world. Excellent friendly staff who greeted us by name each morning.
5
We celebrated my birthday with dinner at Melt. When my SO made the reservations, they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and he told them that it was my birthday. When we were ready for our dessert, they presented me with a small chocolate cake (maybe a four inch square cake?) that was very good. What we liked about the restaurant was the large variety of seafood and meats. I especially liked their lamb chops, lobster and scallops. Service was attentive. We went back several times and our plates were cleared before we got back to the table. The dessert station had a good variety of items. We tried some of the ice cream and it was very good. Memorable meal
3
The a-la-carte Food was reasonable but nothing to shout home about. The service in the first half was outstanding. They may have had a shift change as our original waiter then vanished and we struggled for service. Very disappointing as I am big fan of the MO group.

We decided to go Melt the World Cafe for our Christmas buffet dinner. The elegant hotel was decked up beautifully for Christmas, and this added a festive touch to the usual sleek, chic settings. The multi-cultural buffet spread was satisfying, and I was happy to see the important things such as turkey, pork knuckles, logcake etc that contributed to the festive meal this season.So, the exploration began with the station that serves the Turkey and Pork Knuckle - both looked tantalizing. I pegged this as the station I must go to. The pork knuckle was crispy. The turkey was very succulent to both our surprise - no joke, none of that rough texture we get usually when chewing on turkey flesh. The cranberry sauce was a fabulous accompaniment.Then there were the Asian food sections - with their hearty display of traditional Indian dishes at one counter, Thai food at another counter, and then the Chinese food counter with soups as well. I had the irresistable bowl of Black Chicken Herbal soup - lightly infused with herbal taste, but the perfect thing on a cold evening as such.Next, the Seafood section. I finally settled down with a plate of seafood comprising of lobster, scallops, oysters, crayfish, clams and prawns. The seafood was rather fresh.Last but not least, my favorite Desserts corner - with a large variety of macaroons, waffles, cakes, tarts, pies, Chinese cakes (kuehs) and fruits etc. I had the Pistachio macaroon (had thought it was green tea- but turned out alot nicer!), a minced fruit meat pie, chocolates in shape of tree trunk sections, lemon tart, fruit cake etc. Everything was a delicious palate sweetenerFor full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/christmas-dinner-at-melt-world-cafe.htm

MY WIFE TOOK ME HERE ON MY BIRTHDAY! If you love, crab, lobster, shashimi, fresh greens and many different international cusines, lots of pastries, cakes, ice cream and other deserts, then this place is for you! The service is great and the staff are very friendly. You will have a wonderful time. Be sure to make a reservation. This place gets full quickly. A little on the expensive side but worth it
4
Good taste but will be better if there is more selection of food. Nice ambience and the staffs were fantastic. Avoid the local staff though.
4
Very extensive breakfast spread. If you are staying at the hotel, a great choice. However, would not go out of my way to eat here or at any international hotel buffet for that matter.
4
the food is good, the quality and service is also appreciable.
Suites all pallets. Especially the choice of Indian food is better then many international hotels
5
A fantastic array of dishes and cuisine styles. Very friendly and attentive staff. Reasonably priced in a great location.
4
When I came her for the first time and the waitress said "let me come with you to explain the breakfast buffet" I wondered what exactly there is that needed explanation :-)
When I saw the size and variety of the buffet I understood.
5
We had an enjoyable Sunday Brunch at the Mandarin Oriental.Delightful ambiance, beautifully decorated with an array of various dishes, wonderful breads of all types, soups, starters, curries and biryanis, the aromas filled the room. One was tempted to taste of many a dish!!.Ah! and the desserts? an absolute feast for the eye. The staff were very helpful and courteous.
1
Sad and shocked to see and even to pay for Missing (AWOL) Good food:"roasted pig, sausages satay, mushroom, corn, tomato, lamb, and steak" no presence of any roast beef lamb or even the outdoor BBQ! Was told because its SUNDAY thats why its not available (Why couldnt you guys inform ppl at "THE OFFICiAL HOTEL WEBSITE")Strange for the Indian food ( Normally famous for being fragrant, full of flavor from the spices) is apparently quite tastless ! The Tandoori is just normal smokey taste chicken , i have tasted hawker tandoori and found it much better!Seafood, the lobster presented is cooked and the meat texture is powdery , defintely not fresh !Prawn, i took the cold prawn around 7.30pm not sure its the second or third refill, the cold prawn taste hard not juicy, shell sticks to the meat, took 2 thats it !Salmon was good.Melt's desserts, my partner felt disenchanted also the table beside us feel that way, did not perform up to par. Strawberries on a stick for the chocolate fondue was served one round only, when i asked around 7.30pm the young specky gal says no more one round only. Seasonal fruits like mangosteen were also out by 7.30pm , no refill till we left around 9pm. (How expensive can seasonal fruits be esp when hotel buys in bulk).Thai Tom yum soup taste like colored salt water, with non of the sour spicy taste of Tom Yam Soup...Lobster Bisque wasnt available only mushroom soup , tom yam and fish maw. Japanese food overall was just edible...To summaries , i felt overcharged and beguile by the previous good review..
4
I was visiting from the US and took my local team here. There were about a dozen of us. Everyone loved it and went back to the buffet many, many times. The seafood buffet was well stocked and everyone raved about the indian food. The homemade flavored marshmallows, ice cream bar and chocolate fountain were also a hit. Normally I am not a big buffet fan but everything here was very fresh and well prepared
3
I have heard and read quite a bit about melt so I kinda have a certain set of expectations... the expectations however were not met. Firstly, i am here for a wedding lunch but the service (or rather lack of) is quite appalling. My dishes were never cleared in the five times i left the table and my drinking water refilled only once. The crab claws in the buffet were all hard shelled dunarese crabs and yet were uncracked. Not sure if i was expected to bite through the hard shells with my teeth? And guess what, no oysters au naturale... like what?! The spread is acceptable with a myriad of delights from Thailand, India and Europe e.g. fried rice with green curry, cold seafood, roti and curries, braised lamb shanks and beef cheeks. I however found the food either bland or too salty. I dun think i will come back again in the near future.
5
I loved the variety of food they have at breakfast, the green juice is delicious, as well as the waffles I was craving some and I was very happy to find out that you have some made my day, fruit was fresh.Omelet station amazing service 
5
Was impressed with the service and the amazing food on offer. The variety and quality of food made it a beautiful experience to eat here. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.
4
The buffet combines Western with Asian favourites plus a number of cooked breakfast options in a very pleasant atmosphere
5
you are spoilt for choice and Toni executive chef will always do her best to make you what you want.
Malou and Ryan always greet you with big smiles ,and try to get you the table you want.
5
Staff were amazingly attentive, and food was very nice indeed.A casual atmosphere united with a glamourous setting.
3
Exclusive, quiet and luxurious place for buffet. Although a little disappointed with the not-so-wide selection such as cold triffle mushroom soup, crispy like crisp garlic bread, fishy baked fish, cooked food, sashimi (only available were salmon, tuna and octupus) and deserts. However, what I enjoyed was the Australian beef wagyu rump in slices, toasted chicken and seafood (crayfish, prawns, scallops, crabs..) Overall, nothing much to compliment except for the marvelous service provided. Um.. probably won't come again
5
I visited this place with some local friends. The buffet was unbelievable. Indian, Chinese, European, Japan and other Asian food in best quality. The service was great, the room very nicely decorated. Also the desert buffet way just great. If you like variety, this is the place to go. Have also a look into the hotel hall which is simply amazing. That is the place where "the dragon can breed".
5
Wide selection. I especially liked the BBQ stuff out in the patio. They have a carvery section. With Morton's next door the beef isn't too shabby. As for the dessert - the waffles are amazing!!!! Freshly made on the spot with a choice of toppings. I love the combo of waffles and icre cream
5
Recently we spent some time over the weekend in Singapore and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental. We had twice breakfast and dinner at the Melt restaurant. It is a quite busy restaurant, especially over the weekends. I would not recommend it for a special event but if you are with the family and you like to enjoy food, it is definitely the best place in town. The buffet offers a various choices of food (Asian & European), it is well presented, tasty and the staff is super friendly. Special compliment to Alex Wong for his superb service, kindness and special treatment during our stay
4
Fantastic food, great taste worth the money. Our waiter went out of his way to bring us special extras to try that complimented our food. Lacking is the atmosphere, more like a a big breakfast room in a hotel rather than a soft, quiet place to dine. Best to sit outside in the garden for less people or in the entrance area for people watching
4
Discovered this restaurant on our last trip to Singapore and enjoyed the food. Opted for the a la carte again to avoid over-eating in what appeared to be a sumptuous buffet. Enjoyed the lobster spring rolls, Hokkien Mee and Nasi Goreng. We were looking at perhaps sharing a dessert with coffee when the lovely bubbly waitress brought us complimentary small creme caramels and two chocolates! A nice touch
5
very polite and friendly staff. Variety of breakfast choice excellent and fresh. Outside / garden tables are recomended
5
The breakfast buffet was extensive and included in the price of the room. The evening buffet price was a bit expensive but the a la carte menu was suitable and the staff were very attentive.
5
Always a good time. The wait staff is top notch, not a single bad egg, ever. Amazing seafood and the craft beer selection rotates very often. They nailed the atmosphere and the kitchen is completely visible. Serious quality here.
4
They genuinely have chefs from every corner of the world cooking up whatever you ask for at breakfast and dinner.
The world's finest buffet
4
This is an extravagant and upscale buffet that will cost you about S$100 with taxes and service charge or more per person should you decide to tip your wait staff.You'll get a wide selection of local Singapore ethnic (Chinese, Indian and Malay) and international food. I particularly enjoyed the lobster laksa; the restaurant chef nailed this.There is a wide variety of other seafood - lobster, crab, mussel and prawns amongst others. The prawns were very good and tasty but the lobster and crab were disappointingly bland. I also enjoyed the salmon sashimi but expected a wider variety besides salmon and tuna.I tried the various Indian curries and naan. They were excellent and on point. Five stars quality hands down in my opinion.The dessert selection was equally impressive. You can go healthy and select the good quality cut fresh fruits, indulge in the decadent desserts like the rich chocolate tort or stay anywhere in between.The coffee comes freshly brewed by the cup. For such an upscale setting, one would expect the restaurant to provide a wide range of sweeteners including Stevia and Truvia. Additionally, one would expect almond and soya milk to be available. They don't; the restaurant has overlooked or ignore this aspect of dinner's choice although it shows that it pays attention to fine details in other aspects.The serivce is very attentive and I get the sense that the staff are there to serve and please. The ambience and setting is posh and upscale. I had a lovely dinner and would definitely return for a special occasion
2
We were there for the buffet dinner and its horrible. Food not replenish. Poor grade salmon sashimi. The cold lobster was dry and tasteless. The pasta counter took ages to cook my order and it came out so salty, it was inedible. The service was so poor that if I were to elaborate on it, there will not be enough space to review anything esle. The only saving grace is e dessert counter. Lovely waffles & ice cream
5
The Sunday brunch at Melt in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Singapore, is pricey but worth the splurge. Fantastic international buffet with free flowing French champagne, South American wines, beer and cocktails. We particularly appreciated the outstanding service of Hooi Nat Meng, who was so attentive, and able to provide expert advice on all aspects of the food and beverages. She did this with wonderful humour and a great personality. We were fortunate to have her providing for our every needs
5
Celebrated my baby first birthday w family(11 adults 2 child) on 17th August lunch buffet.. Total enjoyment of quality food and service.. Special thanks to waitress Wai Meng who was friendly n helpful.. Took pic n prepared it for us before we left the place.. Price on the high side but highly recommended..

We came to the weekday Melt international buffet for my birthday in August 2014, and my three friends and I were all extremely impressed with the service we received. We were the first ones to show up, and they were happy to show us through all the selections available. We were helped primarily by Santosh Kumar, the resident Indian chef, who was out on the floor throughout the service. One of my friends has a gluten intolerance and asked our server if they had any gluten-free bread, so the server had Mr. Kumar come to our table to take her request. Just ten minutes later he had a full plate of gluten-free bread, just for our table, since it wasn't featured in the main buffet. We were so impressed and thankful! A different friend of mine has a very sensitive stomach and couldn't handle most of the spices and sauces in the dishes, so she asked if it would be possible to get a plain cooked chicken breast. Lo and behold, not much later, there it was! Served by Mr. Kumar again. And I have to say, that plain chicken breast looked GOOD - it was cooked to perfection - I was jealous, and I had eaten just about everything else in the place LOL. I know we must have seemed demanding, but we truly did have a reason for it all, and they seemed to understand that.We were very impressed by the servers' willingness to help and Mr. Kumar's generosity in accommodating our group. I have to say, although I appreciated the variety of food and it was good, I didn't find the quality to be quite as good as some of the other hotels in Singapore that I've been to (e.g. Mosaic at the Carlton, Pete's Place at the Grand Hyatt). HOWEVER, in Singapore, exceptional service ALWAYS wins my vote! (And if you've been in Singapore very long, you'll know why I appreciate it so much haha.) The free flow wine at $20++ was a STEAL as well, one of the best drink options I've seen around. All in all, we had a great experience at Melt and I was happy to have spent my birthday with them :)(OH - and they serve fresh waffles with the ice cream bar....I'm just sayin'
5
Brought my bestie here for her birthday celebration. While cracking my brain for buffet, melt the world came into my first choice. And here, we came! Food spread again did not disappoint my guests and I. Oysters are replaced fast enough and fresh. Staff never failed to remind us to watch our steps while walking towards our seats. Clearing of plates is fast. Staff are alert to our needs. And they gave a small slice of complimentary Birthday cake to my guest as per request. Thank you very much. I will definitely come back again for celebration!
5
Big buffet. Superb range of food, including vegetarian. Great sushi. Good coffee. Huge desert bar - too many choices.
5
Have dined here multiple times. Definitely one of the best buffets in Singapore. Spread of food is fantastic, especially with the outdoor BBQ grill on weekends. The seafood and japanese sections are winners. Overall, albeit pricey, this is definitely a top 3 buffet.
5
We always have gathering in buffet hotel restaurant every 6 months and this is one of our best.We went there during my pregnancy, I cant eat raw food but the choice was spreadable. Very satisfied. As today, the price during lunch hour is about $100 per person. Please call them to make appointment
5
We recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, and for four days had Breakfast at Melt. The selection of food in that restaurant is so extensive, you could go for weeks and not have the same thing twice. There are two rooms, with about four different stations with different foods, both Asian and European. The staff were super friendly and on hand to get anything you want. GREAT breakfast Buffet
5
Breakfast,lunch or dinner the buffets here are just amazing.The food is so diverse and always plenty to choose from. the kids just love the waffle and pancake bar at breakfast and orders are always plentiful. From the egg chef, to the juice bar it lacks nothing and if it does the staff are always helpful in getting that rectified as quickly as possible
5
Melt-The World Cafe is one of the best buffet restaurant in town! We went there for our dinner and they required credit card information for reservation. Choices of buffet spread include a BBQ section, sushi & sashimi, pastries and dessert, Indian vegetarian, bryani & tandoori corner, roast wagyu beef, laksa, etc. We especially like the BBQ section, which is located outside the enclosed dining area - the roast piglet has a crunchy skin with tender and flavourful meat and my kids kept going back for their satay & BBQ prawns. Their salmon, tuna and octopus sashimi are very fresh - clearly an excellent choice for sashimi lover! Laksa with lobster is also addictive! Roast wagyu beef was tender and marvellous! Must definitely try their homemade mango ice-cream - not too sweet and went very well with the wafer. Note that the buffet comes with coffee and tea.The services are really first class! Since my 2 kids are not really big eater, they decided not to charge for their meal - a great gesture indeed! In all, it was really one of our most enjoyable dinner - two thumbs up for the restaurant! Tip: For extra value, you might want to use UOB credit card - currently there is an on-going 3-for-1 buffet promotion. 15% discount on total spent for credit cards from HSBC, Citibank, AMEX and DBS/POSB

We came here for weekday lunch buffet. It is expensive buffet but, worth spending. Five star quality food and service. Best international buffet we had so far in Singapore. Nice and clean seating arrangement, nice distance between tables so, you have your privacy. Easy reservation process. Staff introdeces to all buffet stations if you are a first time visitor. Friendly, helpful and attentive staff. Great service. Huge buffet spread. Japanese sushi, sashimi, seafood, thai, indian, local delights, pastas, cheese, cold cuts, desserts and many more..... Everything was just yummmm!!!!must try their indian selection. Chicken tikka and fish tikka was too...good. Also, dessert section was quite impressive. Freshly made waffels with homemade ice-creams, sorbets etc. must must try their... Warm chocolate fondant cake. Thumbs up to this buffet and Service. Highly recommended to all buffet lovers
4
I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental for a work conference and had buffet breakfast and lunches included in our package. Food was fresh, beautifully displayed and staff were friendly and attentive.The pastries and dessert section was amazing at both breakfast and lunch. Really enjoyable. Would definitely recommend a visit
5
During our last stay we ate breakfast at Melt. It is one of the things I will miss most from Singapore. Master chef Lincoln Lim and his staff laid out an amazing spread each and every morning. Excellent selection of top quality dishes. The service was superb. The staff remembered our favorite beverage order (two cappuccinos) and suggested new fresh squeezed juices for us to try each day. They took great care of us!We returned for dinner one night and enjoyed local favorites chicken rice and laksa. Fantastic dinner in a lovely and relaxed setting.
5
This was my first time to Melt and the reviews suggested we should be in for a treat, consistently picked as one of the top 5 western buffet venues in Singapore. Now I see why, the location was nice, the service was great and the choice of food superb.For me the fresh fish and dessert choices were the best, whilst the wine list was extensive it was a little pricey even for Singapore.It was my Dad's birthday and they presented him with a cake which was a nice touch.A good tip, you get 15% discount using HSBC cards
4
Amazing variety of food served in buffet, vast selection of dishes from a variety of cuisines, good dessert selection. I like the japanese section. Everything from soups, breads, starters to main course was delicious. Went for business lunch.
5
All the food~ Wide Range Of Selection
Thick Ham, Yummy Grill Chicken, Freshly Blended Juice, Omelettes and Waffles~
When we were lead to our seats, the staff get us juices before leaving us ~
5
The selection of food and desserts for both breakfast and dinner is outstanding. I must say I do think they are a little too expensive which meant I would not enjoy their food everynight but definitely worth eating at Melt. YUM YUM YUM.
5
Good price, amazing selection of foods; European, Asain including crab legs and lobster tails, curry's and vegetarian. Everything I put on my plate was very tasty. Loved it and would certainly eat there again!
4
Brought my family there to celebrate mother's day. Love that they have a wide selection of international cuisines, especially fresh seafood like lobsters, crabs, alaska king crabs. Food was delicious and dessert was ok. Certainly a place to be visited again!
5
There is not one thing I disliked about this place. The food is incredible, very well cooked and beautifully presented. The staff are attentive and friendly and make you feel completely at ease. My early morning visits here for breakfast were a delight and I would always dine here if I were to visit Singapore again. I will never forget one waiter who served my husband and I, he was funny and friendly; Jobin was his name. This is going back 5 years now but my husband and I still remember him!Great staff and fantastic food!!
5
We had the Bistro service last evening and it was excellent to say the least! You can go from a wonderful seafood experience, curries, Asian delights, and on to the high quality western dishes of roasts etc. The Chef greeted us we were early dinners and proceeded to explain all of the delightful curries that he'd prepared that day and offered for our tasting. The curries were prepared in the traditional manner from spices first and not gravy stirred into pre prepared ingredients. A wonderful culinary delight. I say give it try when next in Singapore

Today had the free-flow "champagne" Sunday brunch at "Melt" with my husband and 2 kids. We have lived in Singapore for almost 2 years and the Sunday brunch at one of the top Singaporean hotels is something to be savoured. These same hotels take great pride in their Sunday brunch and there is a lot of competition between them. We have had some fantastic experiences at Raffles, the Capella, the Fullerton hotel and the Shangri-la. Unfortunately our experience today was the first bad one we have had and disappointingly, happened at a place we least expected it - the Mandarin Oriental. Bearing in mind that "Melt" charges SGD 158++ for free-flow Veuve Cliquot champagne Sunday brunch we were shocked to discover that in the words of the "Melt" manger, they "dilute the champagne with white wine". This information was only offered once we pressed the staff many times as to why the champagne did not taste right. To be fair to the hotel, the staff were exceptionally good and the food was decent. They did not make us pay the bill but it infuriates me that management were so dishonest. That is absolutely unacceptable as it makes me wonder what other "short-cuts" are being taken with respect to things such as hygiene. Frankly speaking I would have preferred to have paid the bill and be provided with the proper product as advertised.Management and staff will blatantly deny what I am saying here, but I have absolutely no reason to be dishonest. My husband has stayed at the Mandarin for business before and only had great things to say. I just want to post this as many people go to Sunday brunches for special occasions - birthday, anniversaries etc and I absolutely want to ensure that people are getting what they pay for as that is fair and equitable
5
This is one of the largest and well balanced buffet i have ever had. Probably one of the best in town. It costs between 80 to a 100 bucks per pax depending on when you go. There is indian, thai, japanese (sushi n sashimi) and general western stuff. Sometimes even a bit of chinese and other south asian. The taste is very good across the sections and consistent. You have the bubbly free flow on sundays too. The seafood is very very fresh. Dessert section is very nice too. The ambience is bright and cheerful. The staff top it all up with their service. Must do. Have repeated and will do so
4
The diversified buffet spread in Melt is impressive and extensive. It featured a wide selection of iconic dishes from every corner of the world, from India, Japan, Chinese South East Asia, France to Europe and more. Appetiser, main dish, desserts and cheese...it is a feast for the eyes! The display is generous, well-planned with high quality fresh ingredients. And the cooking is authentic and convincing. Ambience is elegant and relax. Service is six-star, lots of attention to detail and well trained. This is far more superior than the other hotels' buffet. All you need are good appetite, great company and plenty of time to enjoy
5
They have an incredible variety of fresh delicious food from various countries. We had dinner one night and they had fresh lobster tails, crab and shrimp which was part of the buffet. Incredible
5
Great cheeseburger first night at hotel, just arrived. Fine service, free Coke (Often a $5 item in these hotel restaurants), good service. They were running an "Indian Food" promo, so gave me free Indian dessert. Delicious.
4
Pancakes, waffles, eggs to order, excellent service despite full occupancy. Good selection of juices, fruits, Asian and Western dishes.
4
Good choice, fresh juices and great coffee.
The range on offer caters for all types of breakfast, from the traditional english to continental and all asian styles.
5
Unbelievable variety of breakfast. Indian Asian Western all cultures catered for. Soy cappuccino no problem. Staff very helpful and nothing too much trouble
5
wow the oysters and Fresh lobster were nevel ever finsh , the meal was simply awesome wide range of food from sushi, indian, seafood to outdoor BBQ. they also have live counters where chef would prepare your drinks etc.. but it is extremely expensive to dine there roughly and 80 bucks with gst =
4
Dine on April fool, service was excellent. Thanks to Wai Meng, excellent service to our table, and also Alex and Anshul. Plates was clear immediately, cushion was offered to old lady, instant ant smile especially Waimeng, special hanks to her attentive service.Service undoubtedly was five star, but chef service improvement needed. There was a pasta station with lots of condiment for you to choose. I wanted an alio olio, the chef Lawrence reply me that thy do not have that in their list ??? As a five star luxurious hotel, the most simple dish also not available for the guest, I would say shame on you. The station consist of olive oil, garlic and chili flakes. I could even cook myself. But the chef claimed they do not have that... Quite disappointed on that. Yet the operation of buffet end an hour early. Disappoint on that as well 
4
During our stay at MO hotel, we also had dinner at Melt. It's a buffet restaurant and is quite popular. Many guests, families, couples, etc. it is a rather busy place and therefore, would not recommend for a romantic dinner. Go there, when you are very hungry. Great buffet, appetisers, sushi, Indian food, seafood, thai food, great dessert, etc. good quality of feed, friendly staf
4
Had breakfast and lunch at this 'buffet-style' restaurant several times during my week-long stay at the Mandarin Oriental. I found the choices of food cuisines offered simply astounding with consistent high quality. Service was excellent too, courteous and prompt, happy to accommodate people's individual preferences. With such a large restaurant catering for so many, how do they do it?Highly recommended
5
Had the opportunity to eat at this spot for seven days in a row! A great mix of Chinese, Indian and western cuisine makes for great variety. Fresh pancakes and waffles made to order are divine. Dim sum, tandoori chicken, sushi, you name and it is here. One of the best apple crumbles I have ever had. Come here for an amazing breakfast or great lunch or dinner. Buffet and al la carte
4
contemporary interiors ,truly world cafe .Nice selection of breakfast from differnt regions and very popular
5
fantastic choice of cuisine. A wonderful experience, with very helpful and attentive staff who guided us through the different cuisine sections available.
5
Great variety of food and fantastic service where no issue or request is too much for the attentive staff.
4
Considering the amount of money you're paying the food and variety is decent. I was expecting more variety. I don't see all the food that are in the description or photos. The bbq food also have very little variety. The dessert is also quite disappointing. Other than that, the rest of the food is quite good
3
We came here in mid-January for the Saturday dinner buffet. The décor was lovely and the buffet started out well but you could tell as time went on that this was not a 5 star buffet despite charging 5 star prices. It was 3.5 - 4 stars at best. The food was quite good and we did eat a lot of seafood but after an hour or so, as the restaurant filled up, you could clearly see that the place was either under-staffed or under-trained. I'm thinking a bit of both. Food was replenished slowly and some dishes not replenished at all. We were only able to sample everything because we arrived right at the beginning. I saw someone call the manager over to complain about the empty fruit platters before they were filled up more consistently and even then the presentation was very sloppy. They also frequently ran out of clean plates and I had to, more than once, go to different stations in search of one. As it got busier the buffet areas also got messier. There was a piece of sushi on the floor in front of the sushi area that was stepped on over and over again. It was still there an hour after I first noticed it. Same with a banana peel sitting next to the chocolate fountain. Staff would walk by but no one bothered to clean it up. Also, the condiments out by the BBQ area had a trail of ants crawling all over them. We have been to many other buffets where the food is always topped up and the place is clean and tidy despite a high volume of diners. This, in addition to the quality of food, is what makes an excellent dining experience. Sadly, The Melt did not meet our expectations and was not worth the price we paid

Try the Buffet Breakfast, a wonderful selection of both European and Chinese and Japanese dishes. In the evening a set Buffet Dinner is worth it (make sure you have a good appetite ) the Shell Fish, Oysters, meat dishes excellent and very good value. service excellent

We were treated to this wonderful Café by our host on the last day of our conference. As there were so many of us, we had a nice corner to ourselves very near to the table. I must confess I am not sure how much this Buffet is per person but what I saw and ate was well-worth the price. The ambience is lovely and you can just sit and enjoy the buffet without being the impression that you need to hurry along. The spread was also fabulous ranging from an extensive spread of seafood (my absolute favourite) with fresh oyster, lobsters, prawns to name just a few.The Buffet was international in that it catered to both the western and Eastern taste buds. There was Chinese, Indian, Japanese, western and several different types of food available. The BBQ was also worth waiting for. We made a bee line for the roast pork as we were told it was roasted to perfection and yes! so it was. The spread was also very generous and the F & B staff kept topping up on the food. The desserts were also really good. The macarons were done very nicely as were the other deserts such as the cheese cakes and the nyonya kuihs. The staff was also very attentive and the coffee was good too. I certainly will recommend this to anyone interested in going for an excellent Buffet Dinner in Singapore

The food here was really good. And an interesting variety. The sushi variety wasn't that special -- quite typical, but felt a bit limited.The other cold seafood bar was actually pretty good -- the staff did struggle to keep it fully replenished.The other problem is the grill is actually outside --- this is obviously to prevent the smoke from filling with dining area. However, it's not particularly well thought out as when it's raining, you actually have to walk in the rain to get to the grill --- strange. The fruits were almost never refilled --- this is a course I like to have after eating a big meal

We made reservation for our Christmas party. Food was ok for the dinner, maybe my expectation was too high. I truly enjoyed the wagyu beef. Had several seafood but surprisingly, no salmon dish is being served (except for the smoked one for the salad!). Got irritated with the snobbish Chinese guy who's making the waffle- piles of waffle are at the corner and he'll only give you a half unless you ask! He won't even dare to offer a scoop of ice cream. Such a turn off for his service. The rest are very attentive especially the Filipino staff- very commendable
5
Staff were incredible. So attentive and their recollection of my preferences was second to none. Did the buffet breakfast daily. Did the buffet dinner once. Great food if a bit expensive. Did A la Carte another night. Only planned a main and they gave us a complimentary soup and a desert.
1
Not so much the food quality, more the bad layout in a miserable room. Staff agitated as they are sharing the pain.
5
This buffet is extensive with a wide choice and a nice amount of personal attention from the staff. There is now the choice of dining inside or in a garden setting.
4
Very good selection, plenty on offer and good quality too. Freshly made fruit juice while you watch.
5
I have company gathering here during Christmas time. All my colleagues love the foods here. A lot of varieties , foods are delicious and fresh. The service staffs are very polite and friendly.The price is a bit expensive but sometime they will have credit card promo. This is the best international buffet in Singapore . We will come back again 
5
They've outdone themselves on both service and flavours. Really anything you could imagine seems to be available at breakfast time here. Our 4 year old delighted in the pancakes whilst I enjoyed some Indian options (ok, I did try the waffles too which we're light and fluffy - perhaps not on the waist line though?). Was without fault even at the busiest time of year, where the longest we waited to be seated was about three minutes
2
Celebrated my mum's bday at this restaurant as I've dined here once many years ago. First of all I must say this hotel/access to restaurant, is not kids friendly at all. - no lift access from car park. We had to carry baby in pram up 2-3 flights of steps. (Likewise, no lift access to shopping mall). - restaurant was split in 3 sections and to get to our table, we had to carry the pram up and down 2 sections to get to our seating. - Upon arrival I was told my guests (family members) have arrived. We were not directed to seats but were left on our own to located them (which wasn't such a big problem in an almost empty restaurant)- Some wait staff were not as personal and friendly as expected. Requesting for water, coffee and tea seemed like a chore too tiring for them. Service with a smile was clearly lacking.- food was decent though not out of the world. Commendable dishes: Tomato soup, beef stew, chicken wings, juices, waffles and home-made ice-cream. Many items shown or mentioned on website were missing in the buffet. Disappointing. Cut fruits looked like they have been sitting there since morning and cheeses had flies on them. There was a 3dine1free promo but I still felt it was not worth it and would have gladly visit it's neighbouring 5-star hotel for their buffet spread and service instead. Lastly, although we spent over $300, no complimentary parking is offered. Yet again, it's neighbouring hotels have done better. Unfortunately this restaurant has lost a group of patrons.
3
The cafe was very hectic in the morning during the breakfast buffet and as a result the serving staff was not as efficient as they should be. The hotel cannot keep up with the amount of clientele they are serving. It was a long wait for more coffee and the buffet was not refilled efficiently. I was frustrated. Two evenings we ate at the hotel for dinner and the service was better. Although we had a slight issue one night the assistant manager resolved the situation swiftly and made sure we never wanted during our following meals at the cafe. Food was fine for a hotel cafe

Came here with friends after their recommendation. We booked a table for 6:45pm and were greeted warmly by the staff upon arrival.The spread there is magnificent, espcially the cold seafood counter. Go early to get the King Crabs as they change it to the lower quality Snow Crab after awhile. THe lobsters there are superb and very fresh. The Indian selection there was probably the best in the whole buffet. Their spinach was perfectly done, lamb curry was really good and their chicken curry was thick and yummy. Briyani rice was well cooked too and their tandoori lamb, chicken and fish were good too. However, their pasta counter was a letdown. Ordered an Aglio Olio but it was really bland and disappointing. Turkey was good though.Deserts were fantastic but they stopped replenishing the cakes at around 8:30. Macarons were really good and the Belgian Waffles are amazing. Their homemade ice cream is really good too especially the pistachio flavoured one. Must try!!Cheese counter was good too but there were some flies flying around.Fresh fruit juices are the only beverages available but the jugs are not replenished fast enough.Overall, a very good buffet restaurant and will definitely come back again! All in all, you have to try their indian food
5
Back for the second time in the year. Always enjoyed the range of food there are served. Am always spoilt for choice. Had particularly enjoyed the Indian food section. The food are fresh and good quality. The service is always of good standards.As we are celebrating birthday, we are delighted to be given a complimentary mini birthday cake.Will definitely come back again

The Mandarin Oriental overlooks Marina Bay.Having read reviews on TA we decided to give it a go.Prices vary with or without alcohol.We opted for the complete 3hr package costing SGDâ‚¬185ppThe buffet catered for European, Thai, Singaporean, Indian and excellent seafood choices.No complaints at all with the choice of food or the quality and the endless flow of Veuve sent us home happy as Larry.Families with kids will love it. Kids club was very popular as was the sweet bar with every sweet and chocolate fountain you can think about.Worth every penny and definitely do it again.Staff were great. Leave your seat and drink is topped up when you return.Excellent Sunday
5
A must visit, fantastic food! I cannot rate this restaurant high enough. The staff are wonderful, and the food is to die for! First class.
5
Amazing breakfast buffet, every possible taste catered to, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Western and much more. Freshly squeezed juices and every type of coffee all with impeccable service. Make sure you book breakfast as part of your room package, its much cheaper this way.

We only were entitled to breakfast in the hotel but what i can say is that the Staff in this part of the hotel very friendly & an excellent choice of food!

After reading some glowing (and paid-for?) reviews on various food blogs, we decided to book a table for two at Melt's Saturday lunch. Heck, this was twice as expensive as the buffet we usually get at Raffles City, but we could certainly expect more upscale food, better surroundings and perfect service.Dead wrong. We arrived exactly at 12pm (the time of our booking) but were told to wait since they were not finished setting up the buffet. At noon ?? What a joke. Actually, the buffet was set up, but they had clients (a wedding party) they wanted to seat first, although they arrived after us. We more or less had to force our way to a table... otherwise I guess we would still be waiting!What about the food? Good, but nothing out-of-the-ordinary. Our cheap buffet at Raffles City has oysters, while this one doesn't! The salmon sashimi was good, but they stopped replenishing it for 30 minutes around 12:45pm. Replenishing was actually an issue for most dishes. I guess that's why they give you such small portions at the dessert and carving stations. If you do find the food you want (hurrah!), your next challenge will be to find a proper plate. Two issues here: 1) ridiculous undersupply : don't bother looking for a plate at the dessert buffet, that would be too simple... you have to go all the way to the fruit buffet to grab a plate and then come back to the desserts... the fruit buffet is more or less out-of-sight, by-the-way, so good luck with that ;2) cleanliness : you'll have to sift through two of three plates before you can find something you might want to put your food on. See photos.At least you could expect good service, right? Well, if you think 'good service' means having to ask two times to get a cup of coffee (as happened several times here), then you'll be pretty happy at Melt.A nice surprise at the end of the meal: Citibank card holders get 15% off the bill. Any card seems to get 15% off. I'm sure they'll offer 15% off if you pay with bitcoins. They are apparently trying to lower the price without appearing to do so. Well, the remaining 85% still hurt.The restrooms are very nice -- give credit where credit is due

I arrived mid-afternoon at the hotel after a long flight, an awkward time to find food. I'm glad this place was open. I had the seafood Laska, which was tasty and satisfying. Service was fine. It was a bit expensive but I expect that from a hotel restaurant
2
I should have realized when we could get a reservation at short notice - never a good sign - that this was not going to be the five star buffet experience we expect from Singapore hotels. Arrived just after 1 and hot food looked tired and oily. The variety was limited and really it was hard to find anything besides the sushi that looked edible. Service was good and it's a nice outlook on a tropical courtyard. But it's the food that counts and on this basis I would go elsewhere
5
The buffet breakfast ranks with the absolute best that I have seen. The range and variety of food was extensive and of high quality.The serving staff were exceptional in their service and they were all courteous and friendly. The staff greeting guests at checkin to the cafe were outstanding.The a la carte dinner that we had was faultless and the waiter's suggestions for some courses of the meal were right on the mark
5
I went there in July with my WIfe and Brother in law. We were mssing our family back in our country and wanted to cheer ourselves. That was my 4th Visit. Every visit makes me come our smiling. We enjoyed the food thoroughly.It has a an amzing spread, from cold cuts, cold seafood to bbq, cooked food and more from diff cuisine. Their deserts are one of the best i had had.BBQ is served out, so dont forget to walk out in the adjoining garden ad ask anything on plate their to be bbqed for you.It is a must visit. It was 70+ per person. UOB had 15% discount on total food. so real value, and their ever smiling attentive really makes my day everytime
3
We heard so much about this place and decided to come try and see for ourselves. Unfortunately, there wasn't plenty of seafood during lunch and our friend who was craving for crabs, got a huge disappointment. Also, the seafood that's really available during lunch was limited in choice. The indian section was good though, a sort of compensation. Service was so-so. Feels like they are understaffed. But if you had gone to let say Thailand, then you would agree with me that there's actually very little presence of so-called service in Sg. So if you compare it this way, then I guess the service is a little better than usual. It made the trip and price not worth since there's nothing much to indulge in. Going to take a bit of persuasion to come back again

As a regular guest of the Mandarin Oriental I was looking forward to dining at Melt on my most recent stay at the hotel.On arrival late evening I ordered the Nasi Goreng which has always been a favourite at Melt.What I was served with was a pale shadow of the Nasi Goreng I had previously experienced at Melt - but at almost double the price tag.There was very little food on my plate with only one or two prawns, and the fried chicken had been completely forgotten. The chicken was shown on the menu but failed to arrive with the dish. The whole meal seemed half hearted and unenthusiastically presented. This would be bad enough but at nearly double the price in place on previous visits it felt like insult was being added to injury.The whole menu feels like the prices have been vastly inflated from their previous levels. It could be the Formula 1 factor has gone to someone's head at Mandarin Oriental as the sad truth is that food now not as good as it used to be but at twice the price.This is not good.Food is far superior and far better value at all the outlets in Grand Hyatt. Never thought I would live to say this but it's now indisputable. My Nasi Goreng at poolside bar at Grand Hyatt was almost half the price and more than twice as good. They even remembered the fried chicken.I hope Melt can get it's act back together but it has fallen far relatively quickly. Think Formula 1 complacency has done a lot of harm to the Mandarin Oriental generally but to Melt in particular. Am sure it must show in the sales figures but is there anyone listening or giving a toss in Mandarin Oriental management

we were greeted in a friendly fashion, helped in our choices and the food range and quality of the buffet was excellant
3
was here celebrating my friend's birthday yesterday and realised that the quality of the food here is slowly going downhill. First the seafood was not really fresh, the meat on the Alaskan crab was flaky and the oysters were definitely not as fresh as we had wanted. the cream chowder was very watery and the chicken ginseng soup literally had small bits of chicken in them. service was still good though which was the only plus point last night. at the price of $88++ per person, I seriously think that there was no value at all
2
Sunday brunch at Melt was disappointing. I had read good reviews and it was recommended by users on the Singapore forum. Champagne brunch cost us $S 136. Free flow Veuve Cliquot champagne, choice of four free flow cocktails and four free flow soft drinks were included in the price.Service was excellent- our glasses were never empty. tables were cleared promptly and staff were friendly and helpful.Unfortunately the food was a let down. A fairly good choice from western to Asian food but not outstanding. Seafood - salmon and crayfish were very good; oysters, mussels and prawns were tasteless.At the egg station, the chef did not put enough oil in the pan and he had to throw out the eggs and clean the pan. Next attempt, he broke both egg yolks and overcooked the eggs.Chips were labelled roast potatoes, the ham was not freshly carved but left to dry out under a heat lamp and the carvery roast beef had obviously not been rested enough as there was a lot of blood on our plates. BBQ food was also available.Desserts were plentiful and the ice cream was good but don't waste your time here on Sunday mornings - try Mezza 9 at the Hyatt instead - better quality food and lots more of it however service is not as good
4
This has got to be the best buffet i have tried so far. not the best selection of food, but every item that is available is top notch. from my understanding, they also make the effort to change the menu once a month, so as to provide repeat diner a different feel every time
5
Another wonderful meal at MELT. We missed brunch because we woke up late but judging by how busy Sunday brunch at MELT has become, that was probably fortuitous. Sunday buffet dinner was just as amazing as we hoped it to be. Staff was amazing... attentive and constantly smiling. They all looked like they were enjoying their work so much. Jasper one of the staff, gave us a cake with a candle, and took a photograph of us and gave it to us in a Mandarin Oriental frame. Wow, we are certainly not going to forget our dinner in MELT quickly

We arrived in Sinapore late on Sunday after a long haul flight and were looking forward to a good breakfast on the Sunday to set us up for a day of sightseeing.... After waiting in a queue for about 5 minutes whilst they set up overflow tables in the vast souless atrium we were finally shown to a table inside the cafe. The place was busy and whilst there was a wide selection of food there were long queues at the food stations which struggled to cope with the demand. No plates, no glasses, no food - I had to remind myself I was in a so called 5 star hotel. After a long wait for the coffee to arrive (cold) I complained to the manager who simply said they had 700 people coming through breakfast that morning which was at the expense of service and the paying hotel guests. Go somewhere else as there are plenty of other places to spend your money.
4
I kept trying to remember that I was sitting in a five star hotel but wow this food was expensive! Everything we ordered was quite delicious (except don't waste your time on the ham and cheese sandwich): spicy curry, tom kah ghai soup, lasagna, texas chili beef burger. All yummy. After a beer or drink each, our bill was $40-50 per person. Quite a bit for lunch, I'd say!We had excellent service here, probably the best of all the restaurants we went to in Singapore. Our waiter made mango lassa (Indian yogurt drink) from scratch even though it wasn't on the menu! He kept bringing us nice little things and was very attentive

We came for Sunday brunch with friends who were visiting. We were told they had a supervised play area so thought that the children could have some fun as well. The play area looked promising with a kids buffet, movie and some toys but the supervision was nil. We found the children unattended in the play area twice and both times had to wait with all of the children several minutes for someone to return. It was not only our children in there. Twice while we were eating our children were brought to us in the restaurant and the children did not understand why. They were behaving and they said she just told them to come with her. Perhaps she wanted a break so maybe she was hinting that by bringing the children to us? Now onto the food. It was good and I really have no major complaints. It earns a star there but the service knocks that star off. Anytime we wanted a drink even coffee or water, we had to ask 2-3 times. 4 of us were passing around the same glass of water because we were so parched and had nothing to drink. It was embarrassing for everyone. I've never been so disappointed and irritable after what should have been a relaxing Sunday brunch. Never again

I have had the brunch and lunch here with my husbandDuring the brunch there are flavors from around the world, Indian, Thai, American etc. A great waffle station, desserts galore, two omelet stations, a lot of choices.The choices are good. It is all just good, nothing moreSame with lunchCheeseburger - the meat was cooked nicely but the bun was a sesame crisp on top that was over toasted and not easily enjoyedNasi Goreng, which was deconstructed so there was a pile of rice and fried chicken wingsWe shared the clam chowder which was not good at all! I think they used the burned lobster stock from Morton's next door and add cream.The highlight was the lobster spring rolls we shared, very nice but again not great at al
5
Can honestly say this was the best service we have ever received in Singapore. Even though a buffet dinner, the service was super friendly,professional, discrete and efficient. Compliments to Alex and Emmanuel who looked after us so well.The food is very good, not the best, but very good selection and well cooked. The northern Indian cuisine is a must and there is an abundant selection of fresh seafood. The grill is a nice touch, but better if you get freshly cooked orders to avoid over cooked food. Always leave a bit of space for pudding and then a nice coffee/tea with cheese.Not cheap, but a memorable experience. Thank yo

Love its paper prata and tempura. My mom loves its salad.
Good spread of buffet. Too bad no lobster.
Service is also very good.
4
The Melt at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel by far as one of the best international breakfast buffets. We have had both business meetings and casual dining at this hotel and would recommend to both vacationers and business colleagues.
5
Selection of food and buffet spread was fantastic - local, japanese, indian, mediterranean, thai, western, local desserts, cakes, juices. The manager and wait staff were attentive and friendly. Let them know if you are celebrating a special occasion. Overall a very pleasant buffet dinner experience.

What many others have said is true, a darn good breakfast buffet at Melt at the Mandarin Oriental. Great food, staff, set up and selection.Many stations and choices, bread, desserts, fruit, custom eggs, custom noodles, carving for ham, then Indian with curries, dim sum, several kinds of salmon, salads, traditional breakfast foods and more. I could easily classify it as an International buffet of sorts.I also liked that they told me when the buffet ended and even did not close it promptly at closing time. Then the manager even went around and asked if we guests wanted anything further before they broke it down, I had a bad experience earlier in this trip at the JW Marriott in Bangkok where the buffet as shut down promptly at the designated time and all food removed within ten minutes. So this was a hugely welcome nice touch.I knock a little off for service, I know it is a buffet and all, still not great service by my server, busy, not really attentive and I had to ask twice for my check and it took forever to get refills on juice. So, food and selection darn good -varied and plentiful. Service, in some ways great, in others lacking slightly. The buffet was Singapore dollars 54 inclusive so, about $39 US tip and tax inclusive. I would say it was worth it
5
It is my fifth or sixth visit and I find the place just gets better! Am there to celebrate my birthday. While making the reservation, the reservation asked whether I am celebrating any event and on the spot she told me I will be given a complimentary cake! I was delighted at the kind gesture.When we got there, the staff at the entrance was very friendly and promptly showed us to the table. Seeing my sister carrying a pram, the staff was quick to assist while we are going up and down a few steps. When I go to the ladies and having to get out of the restaurant, the another staff greeted me and said, " see you shortly." It is this very small gestures that made me feel very welcomed.The spread is very good. Being there a few times, I have concluded there is no way to try everything and I focused on the areas I liked. The western cuisine is very well done, with special attention paid on the cooking time of different meats and fishes, result, they are tasty and tender!The Japanese section, I enjoyed the soba. One of the better sobas compared to those I found in other buffets. Loved the Thai food section which always have boiled soups. The Indian food section is a must try! Many varieties of food and they are well done. Enjoyed the grilled tandoori fish.There is a section that serves wanton noodle. Pretty enjoyable too. Dessert Is not as memorable as other sections of the restaurant, but that is fine with me as I am almost full.I will definitely return again
5
This was my 2nd time visiting Melt and definitely not the last time. My friends and I all agreed that this was one of the best buffets we have visited so far. Probably because we went on a weekday and it was not so crowded. The staff were so attentive and polite. The Indian selection tasted better than the various restaurants I've tasted in Little India itself. The presentation of the food was very pleasing to the eyes (definitely not one of those buffets that showcases a mountain of food), small portions of well presented dishes. No matter how good were the appetisers and main course, please leave plenty of space for the desserts and cheese. The freshly made waffles and the homemade ice cream made me feel that I wish I had a bigger tummy to enjoy more chocolates and sweets. The weekday buffet package also gives you a range of juices to enjoy which is rare for buffets.Definitely will return to try the Sunday Brunch with champagne of cours
5
Had breakfast here and it was amazing. So much choice! Food was very good and they even make waffles on request and scrambled eggs/omelets. Lots of fresh fruit, fruit juices and you could choose from different types of breakfasts (english, indian etc). Highly recommend it, although it was a bit overpriced
5
Went here two times; both were really good. First time I had the buffé and my mom had the a la carte and she was brought appetizer and dessert without ordering it because the staff wanted her to be able to eat while I was pigging out on the buffé only to find out that they thought I had eaten so little that they charged me half price (children's price)! This is thought was such a nice gesture from the staff
4
We just went down for a coffee and were overwhelmed with offers of food. Staff seemed so worried that we did not want to eat but in the end tempted us with some small muffins. Our son arrived and ordered breakfast. Next thing a fresh fruit platter arrived and then finally his breakfast of salmon bagels and a salad! The staff are so attentive and made sure we had every comfort we needed

Whatever food you want - Melt serves. Pros:1. Food quality - be it Sushi, fresh squeezed juice, BBQ, Indian cuisine, raw bar, Melt has it and in abundance. The food is fresh and of excellent quality. I ate here for over 3 years when staying at the MO on business and more recently having become a resident of Singapore come whenever I have time. 2. The service: no need to speak at length here. Everyhting you would expect from the MO - attentive, accurate and efficientCons:1. Can be pricey BUT based on the quality and quantity it is a fair priced menu. Advice - go hungry, leave stuffed!2. This is a big restaurant with I would guess in excess of 400 covers. That has two potential issues - when quiet it feels dead and has no atmosphere. When busy it can feel like a work canteen. That said the restaurant is clever in compartmentalising the space so no huge vacuous areas develo
5
The BBQ is a must succulent lamb chop steak shrimp the works. Good sushi thai pasta n Indian food. Nice desserts n chocolate fountain. Attentive staff n good service. Full bar. A bit on the pricey side. Could cost upto S$ 100/ head with drinks.
5
We dined there twice in the morning. There are many choices of tasty food. The staff are efficient and services are very good. We eat full and are happy!
4
It is my 4th visit and I celebrated with my friend our birthdays. Loved the range of food. Found it to be more value for money to go during lunch. Liked the ambience which is clean and quiet. Will go back again.
5
Everything you could want for breakfast. Staff very good and food excellent. Only conplaint could do with more staff cooking eggs as long queue when busy.
5
Dinner with family on Sat night. Best buffet ever- huge selection of cuisines (salads, sushi, very fresh seafood, bbq to order, indian, japanese, italian - something for everyone) & the dessert bar is too die for!! Staff are friendly, efficient & very attentive - my husband was on crutches & our waiter brought selections to him. Typical Singapore prices - so don't eat during the day to get your money's worth
5
Went to melt on last evening of holiday totally beautiful food beautifully presented. So many choices difficult to know where to start! The only problem is getting full to quickly . If you do not eat any where else in Singapore make sure you eat here
4
Special thanks to Anshul and team for their excellent service. We enjoyed ourself with the buffet dinner. The seafood were fresh the chef keep replenish the food. But we were disappointed about the pork belly which the skin were soggy compare to 2 years ago. We like the dessert especially the wafers and the wide spread of fruits.

A disappointing brunch at another 5* hotel reminded me of how amazing the Melt is. It is by far favourite champagne brunch is Singapore. From the atmosphere of the restaurant to the quality of the food served, it’s simply a delight. From the moment you arrived, are ushered to your table and glass filled with champagne to when the staff all wave you off the service is impeccable. I have a tomato allergy and a manager saw me looking at the mango salad longingly, within 5 minutes he had a tomato free portion delivered to my table- I didn’t even tell him where I was sitting! The foie gras served with a variety of sauces is cooked to perfection in front of you at the serving area. There are also no fewer than 3 cuts of meat on offer in this area too. For meat lovers, there is also a grill station outside to cook your steak, sausages or lamb to order in the garden. There are no fewer than 12 cheeses on offer with a selection of accompaniments, all beautifully ripened. Whilst I am usually full before I get to buffet desert sections, I always make space at Melt. From the delicately presented profiteroles to the authentic bread and butter pudding- not forgetting the delectable macaroons there is just so much choice! The best thing about these deserts, they are not empty calories, you can really taste the quality of the chocolate and cream that have gone into them Over all, if you are looking for a Sunday brunch to host a special gathering or simply just to indulge I doubt you could be disappointed by Melt

Went for the Saturday night dinner buffet, excellent spread! Good:The salad bar was a delightSteamed crab claws were greatThe mashed potatoes with the various stews were beyound excellentChinese/Korean section was niceBad:The Indian food was not niceThe sushi section was okayThe grill was not interesting or tastyCan't wait to go back
5
Amazing buffet! (AND a la carte menu available)Usually, I am NOT a fan of buffets; however, Melt is VERY clean, VERY well organized, NOT cramped and includes an unbelievable selection of foods from around the world... All in one place!I don't think I have ever had such personal (remember your name, beverage, likes, etc.) kind of service at any other buffet! Servers are always smiling and always trying to anticipate your needs, wants and desires. KUDOS to the management and staff for setting the service standard very high ... AND maintaining it! Breakfast is included with your Mandarin Oriental Hotel room.Lunch (i didn't try it, but wished I had!)Dinner: Menu or buffet is excellent... Chinese, Indian, English, American, Japanese... they have it all! Prepared well and appealing to the eye! Be sure you're hungry!Thank you, Melt
4
This is the hotel breakfast room and it can be mayhem
Food choices +++++
Clean and serviced very well but get in early, ask for an outer table to avoid the noise of families
5
Sunday champagne brunch never ceases to please; even now with the kids there was something for everyone AND the staff looked after our kids after they finished. A very strong recommendation!

My wife and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for four days, and we had complimentary breakfasts at Melt included. I was BLOWN AWAY by the selection and quality of the food. Just an incomplete list of what they offer: a table each of hot Chinese, Indian, Western, and I think Japanese food; fresh dim sum; hot noodle soups; pastries; fresh juices; wheatgrass shots; various yogurts, mueslis, cereals; fresh fruit; I absolutely loved getting up and eating there every morning.Service was also fantastic, with quick table-clearing and help with obtaining new napkins/utensils.My ONLY regret about the stay, and about eating at Melt, was that we missed one breakfast as we got up too late

Been for a couple of Sunday brunch buffets with family and friends with the most recent being New Year's Eve 2012. Having sampled brunches at other similar level singapore hotels I would rate this one as above average but no more than that.Plenty of choice as I would expect from a hotel of this standard, but the quality on offer varies greatly. The cold/hot seafood and shell seafood is good, grill is just ok. The European style stations are pretty poor especially after an hour or two. The cheese plate is very poor.This brunch is well priced and offers very good value and as such attracts a large crowd.If you a foodie then give this a miss and goto the dolce vita Italian on floor 5 which is very good. But if you are a pile me high buffet eater who likes their 10 courses (and does not mind large football style crowds) at a very good price then this is worth a go.The New Year's Eve buffet was worth the entrance price alone just to get onto floor 5 later to witness the spectacular fireworks

Read about all the positive reviews on the spread, ambience etc.Went there on the 15th Dec, and they included festive items, such as log cake and roast turkey.Quality of the food was excellent. The outdoor BBQ counter also produced very tasty meats, sausages and satay. Food was also replenished very quickly. The chocolate fondue and ice-cream waffle was also excellent, and so are the cold seafood, namely the prawns, scallops and lobster. The service was also excellent, plates cleared quickly, water refilled. As we were celebrating my day's birthday, the staff also did a small birthday cake, candles and all. Well done!Overall, the atmosphere and ambience was pleasant and cosy, unlike some other buffet places such as MBS's Todai which is more rowdy and noisy. Did not see many items which was mentioned both here and by friends. Some of the must-haves, such as crab, and oysters, were missing. Sashimi was very limited, also looked forward to more cooked seafood items such as salmon etc but did not see much. the desserts were also quite limited, contrary to what was mentioned. Hunted high and low for macarons, mousse etc.At $98++, not worth for the "limited" spread at all

I had dined here before but this time I am reviewing about its christmas takeaway for a lunch party. Even though the spread was not extensive, I am appreciative very satisfied with the friendly service of the butlers and chefs. for more details and pictures : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/12/mandarin-oriental-merry-christmas-lunch.htmlhighlights include : Boneless Honey Baked Ham with heavy pineapple sauce & Dijon mustard, roasted turkey, macarons and the delicious logcakes

Reserved a table for 2 on my birthday. Impressed with the staffs. Attentive and they address me by my name when asking if I enjoy the food etc. Seafood and appetizer section was superb. Indian and chinese not much to look forward. Wide range of dessert. drinks not included. You can ask for wine or juice with a cost. I had white wine, about SGD20 per glass. Not too expensive, considering the place.Good atmosphere, the crowd there was not too rowdy. Food was replenished very fast. Ended the dinner with a complimentary cake. Price was SGD72++ not including the drinks

The Melt has everything a great restaurant should have. The service is outstanding, everyone knows your name after a day if you are staying at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. There is a wide selection of food for all nationalities and those that like to try new and exciting foods
4
I've been here thrice in the past 4 months.The service is top notch but the food is not fantastic. The salad station is great, and there's a large selection of desserts including home made icecream, chocolate fondue, local Ice Kachang, cakes, pastries and more. The main draw for many people is the seafood counter but as I am not a seafood lover thus I'm not impressed with it. My boyfriend loves the sashimi and said it's really fresh. The BBQ counter outside offers BBQ meats and seafood but the taste is just normal. Lots of fillers in the buffet including pasta, rice which were bland. The strange and very annoying thing about their pricing is that they consider Thursday as a "weekend". All other restaurants charge weekend prices for Friday, Saturday & Sunday but Melt charges us weekend prices for a weekday! Considering each person is around SGD80++ for a weekday dinner (but weekend price), I won't come here if I have the choice

The quality of the fresh seafood was very good, though a few people remarked that it was a pity they didn't offer oysters. I loved the fresh prawns and the scallops! There was a nice selection of cheese, which my friend was very pleased with. We loved the sashimi which was very fresh and of good quality. The cold cuts were also well-presented, and the salad choices were great.The pasta station was very popular, and I loved the mushroom cream pasta I had. The aglio olio was nice too, but could be a tad spicier. The roast beef was nice, but I felt that it was a bit cold and thus lost some of its flavour. The Indian selection was not much when I visited, most of it being vegetarian, and only 1 chicken and 1 fish choice. There was also pratas being made fresh for those who want one.The Chinese slection were the usual sweet and sour pork, which was really a disappointment. The chicken wings were nice, but they were tiny in size. The roast pork was only so-so, I could get better at coffee shops. The fish was praised by everyone, and the seafood stew was a nice choice.The BBQ station was quite disappointing. I had a piece of lamb that was dry and seemed overcooked. Maybe it would help if they didn't cook everything in advance, that's probably why the lamb I had was dry and cold. The baked potato was nice, but there were no sour cream or such to go along with it. The waffle station was popular, but I found the waffle not that tasty if it wasn't for the ice cream to go along with it. The cakes were delightful, though very rich, so if you're like me, you won't be able to handle more than a couple of tiny pieces. Overall, it was a good buffet, but too many "misses" for one that cost close to $100. I'll probably never come back here again, because for maybe half the price, I could go somewhere else for a decent buffet.I need to add the service was really good, everyone was very polite and quick to meet your requests. They come around to top up your water and fold your napkins when you leave the table. Plates were cleared promptly. They even had a little introduction tour around so you'll know where everything is

Comprehensive and good variety of food, high quality ingredients and free flow of champagne during Sunday brunch. Very laid back atmosphere and clientele a good alternative to the more established brunch locations.
5
It's one of the best place to go for a nice spread of food - not too much, just enough to satisfy the palate, and yet I have never yet hit the dessert table.... The food is just too yummy!
4
It offers a wide range of choices for breakfast. From fruit, param ham, croissant to wonton noodle and indian curry.
5
Melt does not look from the outside as attractive as what is inside. If you like Asian kitchen, International kitchen, seafood, sushi, and especially deserts you will love the Melt. You can also sit outside if you have had your share of air-conditioning already.
2
My friend and I went to Sunday brunch at Melt after reading the reviews and seeing the price tag of $25 to $60. My friend had made the booking, we ordered wine and got stuck into the food.Lovely experience all round until the bill came - over $300 for two 
5
This is the place for a familly sunday brunch. We love to go there once in a while (would go more often but a bit expensive).Located in an elegant Hotel, the World Cafe will stun you.Any Cuisine you like, you may have. The buffet stations are beautiful, everything is fresh. For me, the sushi are the best in Singapore.The kind and attentive service make of this place the place to start a good sunday
4
Catch up with girlfriend and spent about 3hrs dining & chatting. Ambience & privacy was great (but some corner was too dim) There's enough variety for each crusine, namely Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and western. I love the japanese section with enough sashimi and display. Seafood was fine but raw oyster aws only available from thursday to weekend. The Indian crusine is nice cos my friend enjoyed it. My only disppointment is the Tom Yum Goong, somehow the soup base doesn't tasted from natural ingredients. It's shldn't be so thick and salty. I enjoyed the dessert as well
4
Excellent choice of breakfast options. Just about every breakfast cuisine was available from your fresh made eggs any style station, to East Asian, Sth Asian, "American Breakfast" and Continental breakfast stations. Exceptional service at the breakfast buffet at Melt. Travelling with two young kids, we were looked after very well each morning, especially by Lara, who was kind and gentle with our kids and helped us a great deal.
5
one of the most amazing breakfast spreads.it made me work hard at fitness centre/walk an extra mile on way back from office to the hotel. and something really to look up to.Benedict eggs was the highlight and something must say had excellence -- day after day at breakfast table. The tall glass of orange juice or the amazing spread of breads... can say that can't do without and look forward to it next time am in Sg.A big reason to stay at Mandarin, S
5
I am a regular at the Melt World Cafe sunday brunch. Service is faultless and the food exquisite and a huge range. There is also an excellent children's room (on Sundays only) with food,movies,toys and carers. There are so many brunch buffets in singapore but this is one of the very best Highly recommended 
5
We had a fantastic meal at Melt, it has just about every cuisine you can imagine and when you have finished you can go and dip strawberrys in the chocolate fountain!
4
Wide range of selection and quality of food is the best. The only "cons" is the price is a bit pricy.
5
You want to chose between japanese, corean, indian, malay or european? Here you can. The choice of fresh juices is incredible.
5
There is no way to describe this place and the amount of food choices you're given. Every type of food you can imagine, all prepared beautifully. The big issue was only choosing what to have!
4
For those who have a small tummy, there's a wide selection here. So try in small quantity so you won't miss anything tasty. The Indian food and Chinese BBQ selection is really tasty. Don't forget the BBQ grill which is situated outdoor, they offer tasty satay and grill meat. However staff here can be slow when tw cafe is crowded. Nonetheless, we can't deny the food is tasty.
5
Having tried out just about every other champagne buffet brunch in this over the years we decided to give this one a go and have done so again and again since. Tremendous selection of food including great seafood, Chinese, Indian dishes and an outside BBQ set up. Unlimited, good quality Veuve champers, wines, beer and some cocktails. At SGD138++ it's cheaper than other, similar hotel Sunday buffets but seriously worth it. It's getting more well known and ever busier so will be interesting to see how long it will be before the prices go up. The surroundings are a bit dark and the garden views unnecessarily obstructed to my mind but you can't beat the food and top-notch service (Wai Meng's a particular star) so definitely worth raiding the piggy bank for

I recently ate both breakfast and dinner at Melt while staying at The Mandarin Oriental for business. I am a frequent guest at the hotel so know many of the staff by their first name and they have my favorite dishes waiting for me. With that said, this is one of my favorite breakfast buffets. They have numerous ethic stations (Indian, Japanese, Western, European, Chinese, etc.), as well as made to oder eggs and noodles - so there is plenty of variety. In addition, for the health conscious, there is fresh wheat grass, fruit smoothies and plenty of fresh fruit. On the weekends they have a champagne brunch and even more of a selection of foods. When I am there for a week, I will usually eat there one evening. The dinner buffet features all the ethnic cuisine, fresh seafood and several carving stations. There are always a lot of vegetarian dishes as well. I believe one of the chefs is Indian, so their Indian fare is some of the best. They recently had a guest chef from Lebanon and this was a nice treat. It's a bit pricey, but their service (especially from one of their supervisors, Ryan) is top notch
3
Heard many good raves and reviews on the Melt. Had pretty high expectations. Selection was pretty standard- Chinese, Jap, Indian, Seafood etc. The soups weren't kept warm that was a down side. I personally felt that it wasn't really worth the price. The food wasn't very fantastic, was pretty disappointed. However, I must say that the service is excellent and the ambience is really good
4
Had a birthday dinner on a weekday. Not crowded. Spread is good Food is mainly fresh. Some meat from the Middle East like Kebabs were hard and dry. Seafood is fresh and good. Mutton is good but steak can be better. Love the pumkin soup. V.good! Desserts was good too especially the chocolate stuffs. A couple of selection. Was too full to eat cheese and bread! Wine is way overpriced( what a disappointment- would have enjoyed the dinner even better!) so just had a glass
4
This is a nice place to have a gathering where you or your guests may have certain preference for food. Simply because the international buffet caters to almost all kinds of tastebuds! My dissapointment was how they had withdrew my favourite duck rilette. In place was a wider selection of cheese and hams. Japanese selection was available but forgettable when facing up to the might of the seafood and ethnic food selections. Dessert was comprehensive enough to keep the little one engaged throughout the dinner
4
A luxurious place to get a taste of Singaporean hawker food. I really like how I can make my own Rojak!
4
The food and service here were very good but the price was very high. I can't recommend it for anyone looking for a quick lunch/
5
The buffet was excellent. A lot of variety from a lot of cultures. I have realized I am not as adventurous food-wise as I thought I was and this gave me a lot to try along with many choices that weren't too far out.
3
On the day we dined there most of the food was cold or just slightly warm. Nothing special about the choices, which means you can find them anywhere else.
Personally this place is not recommended by me.
5
Have visited many buffets around the world and this one remains one of the best. The quality of food is exceptional. Highly recommended.
5
Had the most excellent Veuve Cliquet champagne brunch at Melt on new year's day! Everything was well beyond our expectations, although we had them very high. Superb food, immaculate service but still managed a laid-back ambience! Very strong recommendations!
5
The breakfast buffets (yes, plural: there is a European, an Indian, a Chinese and a Japanese buffet as well as separate counters for fish, cheese, fresh fruit, pastries etc.) at the Melt-The world Café in the Mandarin Oriental Singapore will take your breath away – and keep you going till dinner. What a great way to start your day
5
We went on a Sun for the buffet lunch as a belated birthday celebration and we could not have had a better time.The lunch buffet has a drinks option for approx $30++ which we opted for and the flow of drinks was constant from a Bloody Mary to start, Moet champagne and good still wines.As to the food it was fresh, the seafood standhad a good selection and was constantly refreshed, Oystery delivered to the table on order were fresh.Great selection of other hot and cold dishes constantly checked and refreshed. The outdoor BBQ had lamb on the spit and the sweetest lamb cutlets. Oh and lots of desert selections.When we had eaten our fill and were leaving the staff invited us to saty for another hour of eating.It was a great lunch
4
I have been to Melt for both buffet breakfast and buffet dinnerThe dinner was quite amazing with heaps of fresh seafood, western and asian dishes and a large array of desserts. The food is of a good standard and the service is excellentI would recommend this restaraunt for all occasion
5
We stayed in the Mandarin and tried The Melt for lunch our first day. We were hooked. The services were excellent. The staff took care of anything we wanted in a professional, efficient and personalized manner. Our drinks were refilled without needing to ask. The staff gave recommendations for food and then gave us recommendations for what we should do while in Singapore. Even getting us brochures to give us ideas. The food was fabulous and extremely gratifying
3
Nothing to brag about, but definitely have to dine there at least once in this lifetime. Service is top notch.
3
Not as fantastic as what I have read in this review but I think they have gotta work on the grill counter. The grilled food is not fantastic at all and the portion is so small.
The atmosphere is too dark for dining personally.
5
Not the cheapest buffet in town but it does serve a great variety of food. Service is worthy of a 5 star hotel and the food tastes great.
3
Not value for money, the seafood not fresh .The only nice food is only sushimi
5
We stayed in the Fourseasons hotel end of january over CNY and got a recommendation of friends to visit the dinner buffet at Melt. We arrived at Melt and the staff that welcomed us was very friendly and guided us to our table. The service the whole night was perfect.The food was very good and they have a big variety of everything you can imagine so we started with the Indian section with a great tandoori selection, after that Thai- a Tom yam gong to die for, they even had our favourite Boston lobster and a lot of different types of sashimi. For meatlovers there is also a big BBQ section with lots of different meat. Not to forget the huge dessert section. Gold for the hips, but just too good.Everything was presented in a very nice way and the taste was amazing.We will definately come back when we are in Singapore again and can only pass on the recommendation our friends had given us. Really worth i

I was visiting my sister in Singapore and we went to Melt~ The World Cafe at The Mandarin Oriental hotel to celebrate my niece's birthday. I was not happy when I smelt 'fish' upon arriving. Soon after the buffet dinner, my brother-in-law had a classic symptom of severe food poisoning. He was so dehydrated that we had to rush him to ER to be treated.The worse is yet to come! 4 other members of the family also came down with severe diarrhea and stomach aches. We suspect it was the raw fish that we consumed at the restaurant. My sister called the restaurant as well as the National Environment Agency to alert them of the problem. NEA promptly investigated the promises but we still have yet to hear back from the Food and Beverage manager, Philip Knuepser. My advise: Stay away from this restaurant!
4
What redeemed the experience and lunch over all was the excellent service and little added extras by Ameya. So it's difficult over all to rate this restaurant as its over priced for what we ordered and what was delivered however with all the little extras it turned out to be a very good lunch.190 SGD for some fish and chips and the lobster club sandwich and half a bottle of Cablis. That's just short of £100.The fish and chips: very thin fish perfectly tender and cooked well but only around 5mm thick so all batter and not much of the delicious fish. Chips a little luke warm and dry pea purée left un eaten. Lobster sandwich: awsome but would not put cheese in it as over powered the whole sandwich but generally sweet lobster. However the reason I liked this place over all is we were served little treats like Clam Chowder, to start as a little complemtary extra and a selection of gorgeous desserts and ice cream. Some of the best customer service we've had in Asia.

This is the second time I spent the New Year Eve in MELT restaurant at Mandarin Oriental. I enjoyed last year and I decided to bring more friends this time. I Booked a table for 8 people very early (at the beginning of dec) for the new year eve. The booking went well. What happened later was very unprofessional from MELT management and Mandarin Oriental.I was showing Singapore City to my friends who came to visit me on the 31st afternoon when suddenly somebody called me to tell me that my booking will not be secure if I dont make the full payment. This is something new, It didnt happen last year. Furthermore, nobody mention this when I booked. I was not happy they contacted me 4 hours before the event.They asked me to pay over 1,500 SGD in advance. When I asked them to accomodate me and put a hold on my credit card or pay 50% of the bill. They simply refused. I had no choice cause I didnt want to look stupid in front of my friends.Im very disapointed by the service and the few effort to accomodate the customer. For sure, I will not go back there again for 31st
4
Went there for new years eve, it was a buffet, the food was amazing, there was soooo much choice. We didn't know how much it was going to cost though so we were surprised when we got the bill of SD$420 for 2 adults! That was with no drinks just the champagne that was included. It was new years however. The atmosphere was ok. The staff were very nice
5
Being in Singapore for 2 weeks we decided to try a hotel buffet lunch for a change in first week and boy we were not disappointed. At the reception desk we were asked for our name and then were escorted into restaurant and shown all the servicve stations and led to our table. From then on we were addressed by name throughout the meal by friendly attentive and a first class team who could not do too much for us very impressive. We thought the food - espcecially the Japanese - was excellent and the desserts many served mainly in shot glasses were to die for. The cost S£80 peer head net of taxes and service we thought reasonable given the ambience atmosphere choice and quality (and quantity) of food. In fact we enjoyed our meal and the experience so much we returned again the second week and were greeted by Anshul who remembered us from our earlier visit (fantastic when you consider the number of people they see in a day) and once more were treated royally. Thanks again Anshul and all the magnificent staff at Melt
5
I had breakfast in this restaurent for 2 days and i must acknowledge it was up to the standard. They have Japnease, Chinise, Indian, American....all kinds of breakfast and freshly taken fruit juice. good variety of breads and cakes as well
5
We had breakfast every morning at the Melt and the array of different foods meant we could try something new every day. Excellent service and great food.
3
Read the reviews - went to see for myself and found an average hotel buffet at 5* prices- have had much better........
5
Melt is a great place to dine, their buffet has your appetite cover. Staff are super friendly, and always greet us with a great smile. The cafe is very well laid out, and very spacious. The overall food quality is of very high standard.
5
I am not a buffet person, but this place might convert me. This place has everything, you are bound to find both your favorite foods, and discover culinary treasures of other cultures.
Highly recommended, but come hungry.
3
Ambience: Worthy of a posh hotel but not exceptional. Adequate lighting, tables were a little too close together so chatter from other tables can be little noisy at timesService: As expected from one of the top hotels in Sg, they clear plates promptly, fold your table napkin etc Food: This is the letdown part for me. Honestly not much variety for hot foods especially Oriental. They do have good Indian selection while main star was outdoor grilled seafood and meats. Those took a while to queue and select then wait to be served. Lobsters great but not very fleshy so you need at least 3-4 halves. Desserts nicely displayed in shot glasses and was the pick-me-up after heavy mealOverall: For the steep price, limited variety and standard taste, once is quite enough :
5
As previous reviews have stated this restaurant offers the most marvellous buffet ---- yes it is expensive but on the plus side it does offer excellent value money providing you have an appetite to match the magnificent variety of food on offer. Quite frankly how anyone could ever find any fault with this restaurant is beyond me. Attention to detail by all of the staff was at the highest level and this was endorsed when the head waiter brought two glasses of champagne to our table as a result of our communication when booking that I was celebrating a special occasion with my wife. All in all a fantastic evening --- thank you to all of the staff
5
This is a belated review to recognise this is undoubtedly the best Sunday brunch/unch we had in 2011. I would be very tempted to divert INTO Singapore for a weekend just to experience this again. The price was very reasonable for the quality; the service outstanding; the kids club very friendly and a great idea for parents and kids to enjoy their time; the food choice and quality amazing. There are no negatives at all and everything was perfectly executed. It was outstanding. if you are in Singapore on a Sunday, just GO. You will be wowed. I hope to return asap!!
5
Singapore is known for great food, so during my recent 5-day visit I tried to dine at a variety of places (up and down the price scale, different neighborhoods, various cuisines).As I was staying at Mandarin Oriental, I decided to give Melt a try. Overall, I was very impressed by the outstanding service, and one excellent dish (I did order several things - but the other items are not worth writing home about).Melt does something I had never seen at other hotel restaurants. They asked for my room number (after asking if I'm a hotel guest) when I walked in. I quickly figured out why, as everyone from that point on addressed me by name (Mr. ___). Even the staff who poured water into my glass greeted me with "Good evening, welcome to Melt, Mr. ___". Nice touch! Throughout my meal, the manager came by twice to check on me, ensuring I'm enjoying my meal. I noticed he was doing the same to many other tables as well. Very professional indeed.The very fabulous dish I'd highly recommend is the Seafood Laksa. I have tried laksa in other places in Singapore, as well as in other countries, but Melt's version takes the cake. It was absolutely divine. It's not the cheapest version you'll find in Singapore, but well worth the price (S$28) in my opinion. The prawns, fish, and scallops were extremely fresh tasting. The sauce was rich and flavorful. If you're staying at Mandarin Oriental, don't leave without trying their laksa. Even if you're not, make a special trip if you're a laksa fan. You won't be disappointed
5
From start to finish, our night out at this restaurant was beautiful. We were warmly welcomed, escorted through the restaurant and introduced to the different food stations and attentively looked after all evening.The food was excellent. Liked the idea of all wines being served by the glass - no bottles.Alcohol makes the night expensive, however, for the overall dining experience of this beautiful restaurant, we didn't mind
5
We spent 8 days each including breakfast great quality top variety good loyal staff
5
This restaurant provides one of the better breakfast fares in the city and is an enjoyment to partake here. They have a great selection from English right through to Indian
5
Had breakfast included in our package at the MO and it would have to be one of the best buffet breakfasts I have ever seen.
Allow yourself plenty of time to browse and enjoy.
5
I have read raving reviews of this restaurant and what I found after visiting this restaurant is that all of what's been said of this restaurant is very true. My family and I had breakfast at the Melt for three consecutive days and we were always very satisfied. The selection is huge with a very international selection of cold and hot dishes, a wonderful pastry section, and a huge dessert section with a range of fruits available. You can seat outside enjoying fresh air or you can be seated in the air-conditioned hall inside. The restaurant is popular so lots of people are around; however, you do not feel crowded because of ample spacing between tables. By the way, the English breakfast tea that they serve is the best that I ever had, and I have previously lived in London for 4 years and that says a lot. Highly recommended!
3
was a toss up between Melt & Morton's next door but decided to go for variety. Melt 's also considered one of the better buffets in Singapore . Well, u gotta try everything once.... They have a seafood , Indian & Jap cuisine sections ... good cold crab pincers which i enjoyed. The buffet was ok but what stood out i felt were the desserts. Tiramisu, Mango cheesecake & fresh waffles with ice cream were the highlights for me. I would recommend this restaurant for those with a sweet tooth :
5
Spread was vast, food was of good quality, seafood very fresh, cooked selections all very high standard. Uses high standard of meats and variety. Has outdoor BBQ section on top of spread. Lobsters, foie gras is not a common buffet selection. Every food section has good variety/ Desserts were amazing! fresh waffles, fondue tower, cakes n pastries that keep you missing it even weeks after. Service on top of everything was also very good and helpful.Will love to be back for more
4
Melt had just about everything you could enjoy to eat the food was well presented and tastey. The only downside to it was the fact that it was very noisy and buisy. If you want to enjoy plenty of good food this is the place to dine,however if you want something a little more romantic give this a miss
5
Been to this restaurant a number of times and frankly, i may be bias as i had my wedding banquet here at Mandarin Oriental.Firstly, i would say that the buffet spread is fantastic and the quality of the food is great. They have the Japanese sashimi and sushi session where the Japanese Chef constatntly sliced out fresh salmon and tuna. They have this corner where they served indian food which is also one of my favourite, especailly the naan and the Tandoori chkn. Right outside the restaurant, they had the meat section where they freshly roast different meats and sausages. Next comes the desserts which is the most impressive i have seen. They serve the different desserts in a very small portion; so that we can have everything offered at the dessert bar which i think is very thoughtful. They freshly make waffles for you if you request and this can be found at the dessert bar too. In a nutshell, this place offered one of the most variety of food on their buffet spread, and this spread offers taste from different continents and we can truely taste the difference in the world's different culture at one place. They say that food is the best representation of a particular culture and i totally agree
5
Having read about great Sunday brunch in Singapore, I was already excited to try, but I never excepted the food to be so great. This is only regarding the Sunday brunch as I have not visited this restaurant any other time. The brunch for us lasted a couple hours, since we decided to do unlimited Champagne. There were choices of sushi, grilled food, asian food, raw seafood, just fried foie gras, desserts and more things that we couldn't even get to. Great service accompanied our many trips for more, with our plates being cleaned regularly and Champagne being topped off before the glass was halfway empty. Overall it was a great experience which I very much will repeat while in Singapore
3
Went there for dinner, so can't speak to their breakfast/brunch buffet. I found the food to be very good, but I didn't find it to be worth $100 a head, especially since the selection was mostly composed of food you could get elsewhere of as good quality, at far less expensive prices. Plus the wine was $20+ a glass. Service was good, but then again, at $100 it sure well should have been! Won't ever go back (for dinner at least)
4
basiiclly the hotel's buffet retaurant standard but MELT did provide varieties and special section for Indian food.
I tried the Wafer with Ice cream which is very good, but cannot find a Creme Bruelee'
3
It's ok but for Singapore nothing that special based on the price. Buffets are a big thing in Singapore many places do it better and cheaper.
5
You cannot imagine a more varied menu, incredible buffett, and service that is as good or better than the best Manhattan restaurant.
5
Best buffet in town!
5
I'm still staying at the Mandarin Oriental (been here since June 27) and will stay again on my return (from a short visit to Hong Kong) next weekend.I just want to take exception and write short feedback on the high quality of service at the Melt Restaurant in the 4F, most especially their Manager, Ms. Sabrina Lim. In spite of concurrent conventions, she & her staff (who are all top notch, to a fault!) were unfailingly prompt & courteous. She sets the bar for everyone else, with attentiveness, attention to detail & a never failing smile that makes the rainy Singapore day come up sunny. And the lady is charming & most kind - indeed, an Oriental jewel. Highly recommended
5
Only went here for breakfast but the food and service were out of this world. They even suprised us with 2 glasses of champagne and strawberries as they knew it was our honeymoon. To top it of they gave us a lovely photo of the occasion. Would definitely return here for dinner

Went for the champagne brunch. Pricey for me as they charge a very small child which at 2 of my favourite champagne brunch places the child gets to eat free. The food here was not bad but certainly not the best. Most memorable item was the nutella crepe. Seafood was fresh but limited. Foie Gras was disappointing. Not too keen in the interior. There are better choices out there

At the Melt you get real 5 star service. The food is wonderful. Lots of varieties. From different cultures.I have not been there for lunch or dinner so I'm not sure what it's like.For breakfast, simply, it's the best atmosphere with the best food and best service

Melt offers an extensive range of choice for buffet breakfast. It can get very busy so it would be worth booking. There is an outdoor area which lovely tropical plants and plenty of space indoors for those who prefer the air conditioning. Service is friendly, prompt and attentive. The buffet breakfast includes an egg station, noodle station, congee and dumplings, indian options, pancakes and waffles, pastries, a wide choice of yoghurts and sliced fruit. The juice bar offers around 7 types of juice, plus smoothies and wheat grass juice for the more adventurous. The expresso bar is also great as you can have a latte or expresso rather than the standard percolated coffee. They also offer a range of smoothies in shot glasses.Breakfast is approximately SG$40. If you are staying at the Mandarin Oriental it is cheaper to get an breakfast inclusive room rate

Super breakfast buffet with choices from Europe, America, India, China and local Singapore. Service is friendly and attentive.If you like to mix roti prada with eggs benedict and rice porridge congee, this is the place to go. All considerations have been taken into account - for example, two types of bacon, both crispy and non crispy are available.Its pricey at S$50/pax. Its also easy to bump into other enthusiastic diners running around the buffet tables.Excellent food and very enjoyable, worth a try at least once. Hard to justify the price, considering coffee, kaya toast, and eggs are available in the adjoining shopping mall for S$3.50

Not a big fan of buffets, but this is one of the best ... Every station is good... Loved the indian and dessert station best...

Attentive service. International offerings. This is an exceptional hotel with few good dining outlets. A bit far from shopping but the service here has been consistent since their The Oriental days.

Great Service! staff & manager very attentive to guests needs. pleasing variety, quality of BBQ section can be improved but other than that a worth while trip.

Simply one of the best brunch I have tried in Singapore. The spread is quite impresive and maybe the best kids room as per my childrens comments. I do suggest to take the free flow package as they will serve you all kind of cocktails included with the Champagne.Can't wait to go back..

So delicious! The food was incredible, and they baked all their own breads and made their own preserves and jams. Sorry mom, but the Strawberry-Rhubarb jam was even better than yours! At ~$50/person, the buffet was pricey, but the food was so good and there were just so many choices. The stations included: fresh fruit and juices, fresh bakes breads and pastries, cereals and yogurts, omellete/pancake station, cold cuts, western favorites like eggs benny and hashbrowns, Indian dishes and Chinese dishes including Dim Sum! Yummy

Another hotel buffet, this one is rather cosy. Counters not as many as Straits kitchen or The Line, but had enough variety to make a pretty good meal.

Went for their High Tea.. The spread was unbelievably little. Perhaps the lunch or dinner would be better...?

Great spread!!! Worth the money to go!

It's a international Buffet, I can't remember what I had in there, but the lamb and the beef is nice. It costs us around $72 per pax, but if you has DBS credit card, every 3 person can free for the 4th diner.

Buffet! Erm, lots of desserts. Seafood is rather limited, but the cooked food is good for a buffet. Western and Japanese sections deserve a mention.
