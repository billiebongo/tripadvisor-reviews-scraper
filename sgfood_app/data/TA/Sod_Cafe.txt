Visited a few times and went for the ice milk tea with pearls without fail. You get to choose a topping like pearls or grass jelly and your preferred level of sweetness - just add the sugar syrup yourself. Me likey. Only tried the truffle fries once and it had no truffle taste at all. Maybe the kitchen had an off day. I'll still go back.The free WiFi and warm service don't hurt.

If you need a air-conditioned place to hangout near your neighbourhood other than the usual cafes . This is a great place to do so. At least food and coffee are decent though the food portion is smaller than we would like it to be. The food serving needs to be improved on as compared to the price we are paying. Small and cosy ambience, service is alright. Free flow of water - iced or room temperature. Food has always taste good -- Try the truffle fish burger with sweet potato fries
