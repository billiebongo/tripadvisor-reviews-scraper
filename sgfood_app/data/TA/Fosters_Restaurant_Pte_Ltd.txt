Ordered the afternoon tea set. The marble cake and the sandwiches were ordinary but the baked scones with strawberry jam and cream were really nice.
4
Typical British type food is offered including fish n chips, steaks , Yorkshire puddings and cakes. Chicken and other meat dishes like beef are available.

We had a gathering at Fosters with old classmates whom we have not seen for over 30 years. Foster is the ideal place for such gatherings. The food is light and we had a great time catching up!Though the high tea variety is limited, it was perfect for us as our focus was to catch up and not to fill our stomachs
2
We visited and had the set lunch menu. The food was average and very small portions. However, the other people around who ordered the main menu look like they had much better food. We would however not return as the staff were incredibly rude and moody. There was no effort at all to make our experience pleasant. Overall, we felt more of an inconvenience than valued customers.

If their Valentine's Day menu is a close reflection of their regular menu, then no thanks. We live near by and have always walked past it, so this year my bf thought it'd be a good idea to eat here. The staff (save for one lady with short hair) seemed confused the whole night. It was mad noisy in the restaurant with the unnecessary loud live music, waitresses talking loudly while staring awkwardly at the customers and clanging the silverware loudly at the counter. I almost thought I was in a Cantonese restaurant. LOL We asked for a table outside and were lucky enough to get one. This romantic outside porch seating area is probably the only good thing at this establishment. We were served with a dinner roll each to start, and i SWEAR it tasted exactly like those frozen bread rolls you can get at the grocery store. Then I had the lobster bisque which i also wouldn't be surprised if they told me it came from a ready made frozen bag that was frozen a bit too long. Probably one of the most underwhelming lobster bisques I've ever had. My bf had the scallops and it was such a tiny portion like I've never seen at a 3 course menu. The scallops were smaller than the ones my family buys to chuck into steamboat. Sauce was nice though. The main attraction of the meal was my steak. It was a medium rare tenderloin. No complaints there. It was alright for a steakhouse. What was almost unpalatable though, were the veg that came with it. It was some sort of soggy fusion flavored vegetables. Im thinking soy sauce and ALOT of white pepper? Gross. That was a first for me. And hopefully a last. My bfs lamb was nicely cooked though he also though the vegetables were strange. Finally, the dessert for a crepe with ice cream also underwhelming. I could make it at home. Big eaters/hungry people might be in need of a bit more after. The meal with a glass of wine was definitely NOT worth the $100++ price tag. I would never recommend this place to anyone in the vicinity where there is much better food and steaks to be had for a fraction of the price just a 5 min walk down the road. In fact, I'm quite amazed this place has been able to stay open so long

Good service, but ultimately the food is ok for the price we paid. A good experience as a test bed for children and their introduction to British cuisine, but if you are hosting, we have had better elsewhere. However, the place is always packed with students and locals, so it must say something about the quality of the food.The restaurant is set in one corner of Holland Village and very traditional pizzeria feel to it. Small tables dominated by a bar in the middle and very cosy. Good friendly staff and very attentive

I have lived in Holland Village area for a while and I had seen this restaurant on a number of occasions! It always looks pretty busy in the evenings, so I thought it was well over due a visit.The restaurant is cute, hidden amongst greenary and low lights it has a lovely decking area for dining and then an old fashioned classic restaurant inside. The service was pretty good, I have to wait a while for my Kiev, but that takes longer to cook so that was fine! They give you bread after you order and keep your water topped up throughout! The food was A mix, mainly British with some Italian dishes! My food was lovely, veg was a little cold and said the Kiev came with potatoes, but it was actually chips! I didn't want those but hey ho! Nice atmosphere, good food, reasonably priced

Was very excited to try this steak place in Holland Village. Was impressed with the lovely surroundings and seating area. Service was attentive. Good wine selection.Unfortunately the steak is of poor quality. I would suggest they source better steak even if the price goes up, as this is one of the nicer restaurants in Holland Village
4
This steakhouse has been around 57 years - since 1960. Recently some friends came to town and we decided to dine at Foster's. With a VIP card, you are entitled to BYO one bottle of wine (no corkage fee). The soup and salad were great and so was the main course. The dessert was delicious. Perhaps their coffee could be better but overall a wonderful evening...thanks to the excellent serve

Went looking for a touch of nostalgia having dined there in the 60's when it was in Orchard. Pretty much everything has changed. Some would say much like most of Singapore. But the four of us all had steaks and rated them highly. So they have been getting awards over the years for a reason. Pretty popular for lunch on a Sunday
3
Reasonable prices, nice laid back ambience to meet friends.
Above average quality of Grilled Salmon , oxtail stew and combo set
Overall good Value for money. Would visit again for the tea set

My daughters and I were looking for a place to have dinner in Holland Village and were attracted by the ambience of the place. The interior is really appealing, like a restaurant you might have seen in 1960's New York or Chicago, cozy and charming in an old world way. My eldest daughter and I ordered cheeseburgers and I ordered mine medium. I was told that they would only cook them well done. The waiter didn't explain why, maybe out of health concerns? I put up a minor protest but eventually gave in and agreed to eat a well done burger. The burger was one of the worst I've tasted, not because it was well done but because there was so much filler in it. I think that the reason they prepare well done only is because otherwise it would fall apart completely. My other daughter's chicken tenders were also cooked "well done." They were more like chicken toughs and looked to me like a little pile of twisted and tiny breaded scorpions. We're going to pass it by next time we're in Holland Village
4
These were the best scones to date. They are flaky and buttery. Wonderful. The down side is that our have to wait until 15:30 and have to buy the whole "set" of cakes and sandwiches for a type of high tea. It is not the place for a nice morning scone with coffee.
4
I went to Fosters for dinner with my friends and was promptly greeted by the staff and shown to a table (we didn't make reservations). I must say that the waitresses were very helpful and friendly so we were able to get what we wanted both for drinks and food! We had a friend who joined us for less than 30 mins and the staff were kind enough to help squeeze a chair in for him to sit and clear the chair afterwards. 2 of us ordered Steak (medium rare) and 2 ordered the rack of lamb (medium). The timing of appetisers and mains were just right and the food were done exactly how we wanted! I had the steak, and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!!We also ordered the drinks which was quite reasonable ($15.50 for 2 alcoholic drinks). 2 of us had red wine and the other 2 had Moscato. The only problem we encountered was that they got the order wrong for my other friend - he ordered a moscato but was served a prosecco instead. It's a good place to meet up and catch up with friends as the place isn't too noisy (there's music in the background and at some stage a performer was playing live - but it is light music that's not too loud)

Went for dinner at Foster's on 13 March 2017 and was pleasantly greeted by staff. There was an 70 y/o old uncle who took great care of the tables and provided excellent service by recommending dishes to us and being thoughtful throughout the entire dinner. He was kind and helpful, and brought different condiments to suit our lamb and steak. Because of him, the entire experience was refreshing and I felt the need to go back to the restaurant to visit him again. I hope he continues working there and he really uplifts the atmosphere in the restaurant with his friendliness and helpfulness. Kudos to this uncle

SGD11.50++ per pax for their Devonshire Cream Tea SetComes with 2 scones, 2 mini sandwiches and a slice of pound cake. Choice of tea or coffee. FIRST OFF, HANDS DOWN the BEST scones I have ever had in Singapore. I need someone to teach me how to bake those scones!!Cake isn't too bad, but usually I request for them to change my cake into another scone, which they kindly obliged. Sandwiches are not bad as well, might be dry for some people, but I quite like it. I currently live overseas, but whenever I am back in Singapore, FOSTERS is definitely one of my must go places. It's a tradition for me to go back with my friends for our chit chat session. The best thing is every year I go back to Singapore, I know I will be able to taste the exact same taste that I have enjoyed since my teenage days
5
This is one of the best places I have found so far in Singapore. A very nice indoor area, fair service and a good food. I tried lunch menu which was really good and the portions were just great - not overwhelming. Sofas were really cozy and comfortable. Really liked this place
4
During our four weeks in Singapore we ate at Fosters 3 times.Christmas Day and New Year's Eve were both good with typical menus for the occasion. We ate in the garden which has electric fans if it gets too hot. There is a singer in the evening. We also had a lunch at Fosters. My husband enjoyed a Beef and Mushroom Pie extremely well presented and filled up to the brim with very tender beef in a rich gravy. There is a good selection of traditional English fare. Red Wine by the glass - at a reasonable price - is better than in many other restaurants where it is often tasteless and vinegary... The service is efficient and amicable. We shall keep a very good memory of this English oasis in Holland Village and will return next year when visiting our son

Came in at 9.30pm on a Thursday night. Ordered food & drinks service ok. Rib eye steak was not a Rib eye & we sent back to the kitchen. We requested dessert & was told this would take 20 mins for what we ordered so no possible. Rubbish service no ambience & massively disappointed! Won't be returning! The appearance of the restaurant leads you to believe an easy going atmosphere but a table of 8 x 20 somethings left, no one approached for 'one for the road' come on guys $200 walked out the door, if I was the owner of the establishment I'd be annoyed!!

Online research on good scones in singapore led me here. It's steak house. And has a nice feel to it. Been around 60 years so that has to be worth something. Was busy. But we came solely for scones. They were very nice. The home made jam and cream was good too. But my chamomile tea was not great. And the 2 scones were the same - plain. Ideally one should have had raisins. The chairs were super comfy. And we are sausages with the scones which was unusual but nice. The search for singapore's best scones continues....
4
Its so nice to be back at Fosters for tea. They still make the best scones ever! Should be more generous with the jam though!
4
English style food like fish and chips are good value for the money. Small restaurant with English ambience . Great for family and kids .
5
Cozy English setting. Comfortable. Could accommodate a long table of 11.
Had the set dinner. Mushroom soup, excellent tenderloin steak. Very good creme brulee. Very good value for money.
Well come again.
4
I went there for the tea time set. The scones were nice and soft. Cakes were nice and sandwiches were normal. Atmosphere was quaint. Decoration in the restaurant resembles that of an old American restaurant.

I tried Foster's with the intention of having a quick budget set lunch, in and out in 45min. The restaurant was one-third full when I arrived and I quickly placed my order. I waited for 15min for a bun to arrive. By that time, the restaurant was already two-thirds full. I asked for the rest of my meals to be served faster and the waitress's response was curt but she got the job done. The soup was served a minute later and less than 5 min after that, my medium-rare steak was served. She even offered to bring out my dessert and tea together which I was happy to have. While I was having my dessert, she asked if I would like to have my bill. It might seem offensive to customers but since I was in a rush, I was happy to settle the bill. In the end, I managed to leave the restaurant within 40min which kept me in good timing for the errands I needed to run. Food-wise was average. The fillet steak was very tender, probably not for those who like a little toughness and chew in their steak. Mushroom soup had real bits and slices of mushrooms so that was pretty good. Dessert was a small cup of fruit jelly. Total cost was $23.40.Overall, it was an OK lunch but not good enough for me to return. And unless you have time to spare, it will be good to let the waiter/waitress know to speed up your orders
2
The Manager,You and the old Uncle who served our table would probably remember us, there were five of us sitting outside on Oct22 for an afternoon tea. We complained about your filthy tea pot; it was not washed properly that traces of (probably) hardened milk/cream was not removed from the inside, blocking the water while pouring it. It is appalling that the most important thing that a restaurant need to focus (apart from food) is taken for granted. We couldn't stop thinking how filthy the rest of the kitchen things are. Anyway, your scones were delicious and Uncle was very polite and apologetic even if it wasn't him who's washing up the dishes

Celebrated my better half's birthday here with my adult children. We love the ambience and the set meals are really one of the best in Singapore. I had the salmon set ($17.90++) with mushroom soup. This is one of the best mushroom soups I have tasted especially when it is bundled as part of a set. Most places serve not great campbell-like soups that come with the set. So this one was a nice surprise - mushrooms that you can taste and very flavourful! The salmon was very nicely done with crispy exterior on a bed of mashed potatoes. Really enjoyed that! Dessert was apple strudel with vanilla ice cream - apple strudel was average for me but the pairing with the rich vanilla ice cream lifted it up a few notches! The coffee which topped up the meal was not any coffee off the coffee pot - it was individually made from their barista-style coffee machine with real coffee (Lavazza, I think). What an excellent meal!Tip : my son upgraded his soup to lobster bisque for an extra $2 (super worth it as it came in a large soup plate and my son said it also had lobster bits in it!). Wife upgraded coffee to latte for $1 and she liked it.Overall ambience is very conducive for a tête-à-tête with close friends or your significant other. Will definitely be here again
5
My favourite place for their newly baked scones since my school days. The revisit is both nostalgic and reassuring for me in term of their cosy antique ambience and yummy scones served with fresh cream (my personal favourite), butter and jam. The afternoon tea set comes with 2 scones, 1 butter cake, 1 sandwich and a pot of coffee or tea. The place has been around since 1960 and hope that the place will adhere to their heritage environment and maintain the food standard
5
Tea for 2. No frills but priced accordingly. Very popular. Scones really good. From Holland Village MTR exit B follow curve of buildings to left. At the end of the row and looks unassuming but well worth venturing into the cool interior. $23 + tax for 
3
This restaurant is a place still use sofa for you to enjoy your steak.The food there are nice and nothing flashing or to wow about.Service wise is okay.They have happy hour that serve two drink for only S$15++. Ice water is FOC.Average price per person: S$40-68+
4
Probably one of the cheapest afternoon tea set you can find in SG. Indoor seating is pretty comfortable and service was good. We like their freshly baked scones, worth it!

We came for lunch on 20/7. As we enter the door, a waiter who was seated by the door simply flag his arm at us to a table and return to counting the piles of receipts on the table, there was no eye contact or smile of welcome. As we walked into the middle an ungroomed waitress attended to us. We walked to the outdoor seats, she accidentally dropped the menus to the floor and stepped over it, she picked them up and put infront of us at our table like nothing has happened. When asked if the $48 steak is grass fed she said "Im not sure but I can find out" then later added her personal opinion " I should think so as nowadays most places serve plant-eating cow. I was shock at her comment, it wasnt the most refine yet unprofessional plus way she picked up the menus from the floor with her shoes stepped on them and put the same menus at our table. We had cod fish and chips since we werent sure about the steak. The fish were good, well cooked moist and crispy. Our lovely lunch was interrupted halfway by the smell of cigrette which we found out were their own staff having 'break' sitting behind us smoking and lunch. We cut short our stay, finished our $28 fish and chips we ordered each, didnt have the 2nd drink (which was 1 for 1). We spent $60+ for lunch here, didnt feel welcome, didnt enjoy our eating enviornment. We will NOT return. The food is 4 star, The service 1 star (since u can't rate lesser). Good fish and chips are widely available like at Jack's place or Fish & Co. We are happy to pay for more for quality but definitely not at Foster with run-down service and energy

Haven't been here in ages. Was not disappointed. Had 2 set lunches. Fillet steak and my date had the Norwegian salmon. French onion soup to start, flavourful and good to the last drop. Date had the mushroom soup. It was creamy but nothing out of the ordinary. Steak was cooked to perfection, done as I ordered it. A bit on the small side but made up in quality. Extremely tender. Regret not having it with English mustard and horseradish. Salmon was well seasoned, and pretty fresh. A tad over done but went well with the accompanying sides. Both mains came on a bed of broccoli, carrots and mash potatoes. Vegetables were spot on and not overcooked or underdone. Mash contrasted well. Must say that the portions were spot on and there was enough space at the end for the simple yet delightful ice cream and tea. Ambience has not changed since they moved here from Orchard but that is not a bad thing. In ever-evolving Singapore it is very nice to have a place that retains its rustic charm. A charming and very pleasant experience. And not over priced either. Highly recommend. :

Had dinner here last Monday. Have not been here in ages, was happy that it still retained its old charm.Dining at Fosters, the logical thing was to have a nice juicy tenderloin.It was.... really really good, nice and tender and absolutely delicious.Will also come back for afternoon tea one of these days
4
Went to Fosters with a friend last night, each of us had a set dinner which consists of an appetiser/soup, mains, dessert, tea/coffee. I am most impressed with service of the elderly attendant. He slowly and calmly explain each course, came over to check on us regularly. Love the creamed cod fish appetiser, moise and tasty. Pork chop is done right, could have a bit more apple sauce. The grilled salmon is a bit overcooked, loosing natural juice. Apple crumble dessert is pleasantly presented. Overall experience is good, we should come back again for the tea & scone
3
This is the second time we have eaten here.The service and atmosphere is good. We chose to eat outside which gives a very lush tropical atmosphere - fortunately with an effective fan.Entrees were good - the lobster bisque particularly so. The calamari was fairly standard but tasty.The main disappointment was my fillet steak (S$48+++) which was limp and insipid. The fundamental problem was that it was too thin. It is not possible to nicely cook such a thin steak medium-rare which is the way I like it.The fillet steak was much better
4
This restaurant is usually crowded even with both alfresco and indoor dining. Reservation is recommended. This is the 3rd time I've been to Fosters and it is still as amazing as the 1st time I visited. Only thing there was no live music entertainment this time round since he only sings 2 days in a week (Fri/Sat). We were there on a Sun late evening and ordered a cheese-baked cod fish as well as a pan fried cod with scallops and vegetables. The dishes were excellent! Although the wait for baked food is at least 20 mins. I had an Irish coffee too and it was wonderful with the whip cream. The bill size came up to $94 which i thought was reasonable for the wonderful food and cosy ambience
4
I spotted this place while shopping in Holland Village. The interior is much the same as they were in Amber Mansion. The furniture and dark brown wood brought back pleasant memories.I had their set lunch - Steak. For SGD19.90 the meal is value for money. The onion soup was a little too salty for me but my friends like the way it it done. The beef was done the way we wanted - medium rare, medium well and well. The sauce is just right - not too much or over powering.We were served with "jackfruit" flavored ice cream. Simply delicious. Is clean honest food - just like the ones your loved ones will cook for you.Service - attentive n discreet - excellent for business meetings.I will come back again for "honest" food
4
This is a nice restaurant, with a kids meal, and what I believe is an american style meals. The kids had a fish and fries menu, my wife had the lunch menu, and I had a US style Angus steak. I had to have a root beer float, which most people dislike, but to me it is the best, and it was delicious. The kids also enjoyed their own. The service was very good, and attentive to details, as my kids are kind of picky. The steak was properly done, but not to my taste, although they recommended another term
2
Called for dinner reservations. Wanted indoor seating which was full so the person on the phone said to go at a certain time to get indoor seating. Went there as advised and still full indoors. Had to wait and she wasn't apologetic for giving incorrect info. My friend's Angus steak was a poor cut but my tenderloin was good. Medium was slightly over cooked. Think for the price (<$50) per steak a la carte, we can't expect more. Drinks are at great price of 2 for $15+++
5
Still the best carpetbag steak in town thrown in with the best happy hour package leaves nothing to imagination. A perennial favourite.
3
A family cafe from a bygone era that has probably seen better days its neighbourhood Holland Village which has long lost its lustre. Still a decent place for a meal of traditional Western food just for the good old days.
5
Great oxtail soup. Must eat for every visit. Other food items are generally good. Service staff are great too. Worthwhile to dine here. For lunch and dinner.
2
We totally loved the ambience of this place. Enjoyed our drinks at happy hour. My husband is a steak lover and thought the portions were just not filling. The lunch sets were pretty decent nothing great.
5
I chanced upon this place when suggested tea at Holland Village. I thought i was so familiar with the modern eateries here. But lo & behold I was introduced to this charming English restaurant. Tucked at a corner hidden by the concrete of the pedestrian walkway. I'm charmed. Love the old fashioned setting. Old songs as playing for a gramophone. Love the hi- tea. Sipping my camomile, fruit cake, sandwich n scones. Yummy. Added this place as favorite.
5
A friend suggested meeting there for Hi-Tea and I was truly ignorant of the fact that Fosters has been around for a long time. I was really impressed with their scones and sandwiches for the price that they charged. The service was attentive and I returned with my Mum to give her the experience, which she thoroughly enjoyed too
2
The service itself (aside from an old uncle who exuded relax aura) is sort of a rushy. It’s not that staffs are rude or something, they are okay just that they run around the restaurant. To give the benefit of the doubt, perhaps they were short-handed that night. Nevertheless, waiters running around isn’t the best thing to have when customers are expecting to enjoy dinner in a relax setting. Food is not excellent, nor bad. I’d say in the “okay zone” What I didn’t like about it is the cost. For the “grilled lamb rack” served with a bit of veggies as well as regular fries (somewhat overcooked and dry), 42 SGD is too much. Basically, the range of prices they have at Foster Steak House is very similar to other restaurants where I’ve gotten better dining experiences. On the good side is their “order one cocktail and get two”. I had martini and it was good. There’s also a live band that sings pretty good songs. Though I won’t change my mind that the prices are a bit hefty for the quality of food they offer, the entire impression could have been on the 50/50 side, if not for the service that felt non-accommodating. To sum up the experience, I do not think I will fancy going back again

I can't believe it took me so many years to visit Fosters. It is unfortunately at a location which is very easy to miss. All these years I thought it was just a cafe nothing worth visiting. How wrong was I! We went there on a Sunday evening, saw it has 2 for SGD 15 premium house pour wine. Either Chardonnay or red so we settle for a glass of Chardonnay and it was surprisingly very drinkable! We had an AWFUL 2 for SGD 16 at Bedrock Somerset just a day earlier hence it was a pleasant surprise. The sofa seats table for 2 was great! Comfortable and tuck in a corner. Ordered baked mushroom with cheese and ham as an appetizer - tasty just like how you'll do it at home. Partner ordered a Fantastic steak and it was very good! At price of SGD 45, we thought it was a steal after the bad steak we'd at Morton's which is SGD 99. I'd salmon steak which I wanted it done at medium rare. The Salmon came out crusty on the outside and inside remains medium rare! I was impress! Portion is good but leave no room for dessert. We'd 6 glass of chardonnay and only cost us SGD 45. Is a great place if you want good food yet at very affordable price. However if you want to experience the "buzziness" of Holland V nightlife, you can't get it here.
3
Right at the end of the row of shophouses, is this cosy easily missed cafe. It's famous for steaks and the Devonshire cream tea set. We were there for a quick weekday lunch and so had their ham and cheese toast and Fosters club sandwich. Both were tasty though unremarkable. Came with large serving of fries and salad so the extra cheesy fries we ordered went to waste. Service staff were helpful. Decor is a little tired and has definitely seen better times.
4
I love the cozy feel of this restaurant in hip Holland Village. Great steak place-I had the Pepper Steak the first time I was there with colleagues from work. The place was packed (make a reservation) with great live music (guitarist). The next time I was there with family I had the Oxtail Stew I'd been wanttng since I saw it on the menu the first time. I'll be back
2
Over priced but nice environment. Service ok. Food poor. Steak is Not recommend at all. The texture of the steak is weird, dry and powderish. Seafood combo is only so so.
4
We have been there during lunch time. The 19.90$ menu is really tasty and includes soup, desserts and tea. However, the service can really be improved. Our waiter, at less, was not so kind. Anyway, its worthy to eat here.
5
Great steak! Reasonable prices and the option of the set menu makes it good value for money. The staff is nice and the atmosphere is short of nothing. Just a really enjoyable meal! Would definitely recommend it.
4
I enjoyed the daily set lunch which costs $19.90 because the soup was delicious, & the mixed grill I had was nicely done. For that price, I had a decent sized piece of beef, chicken & salmon. Atmosphere was homely & cosy.
4
ordered the set lunch of 3 grills. very tasty and portion is just nice. environment is very nice and service is good. set lunch comes with soup, main course, dessert, and coffee/tea. overall worth the price we paid for.
4
Lovely little setting for this restaurant/ bar in Holland V. We've been here a couple of times, both to eat at to take advantage of the 1 for 1 on cocktails happy hour (and pleased to say cocktails are a good size and strength and value for money, unlike some of the other bars in Holland V. Food is lovely, little bit expensive if you eat a la carte but the set menu is better value and the portion sizes good. Service is a little slow, but on a Friday and Saturday evening they have a singer who is really good (and again far better than some of the others in holland v). Definitely recommend, giving 4 starts only because of speed of service and price...
4
Fosters Restaurant, established in 1960, is a must to visit in Holland Village. There is MRT station (Holland V) at the door step of the restaurant. It is a English style decors with great food. The waitress who served us was polite and helpful with recommendations for drinks and main course. We tried the waygu beef ($98) and was really tender and tasty. Value for $ and you wont regret, but will regret not having it! You may wish to hit the restaurant before 8 pm to take advantage of the happy hours for cocktails and other drinks
3
Came here for dinner with a friend one evening with reservation. We found the service to be pretty good, although a little bit on the slow side. The ambiance was lovely - quiet enough for a conversation and beautiful interior.The food however, was a different story. It was very overpriced for what it was. My friend ordered the vegetarian pasta with mushrooms and asparagus - nothing fantastic. I went with the oxtail stew and searched long and hard for edible pieces of meat. The mashed potato was rock hard and the quantity of garden vegetables served on the side was pitiful.Given the price of the meal and how we left hungry, I was disappointed. I'll come back for drinks, but not a meal
5
We had an excellent meal at Foster's where the staff are somewhat telepathic as they attend to your needs even before you tell them what you need. My wife was amazed when she was asking my son what he thought the dessert for his set meal was and a staff who was a distance away came across and said that it was Creme Brulee. Either they read her mind ... or her lips.They also read my mind as I was looking to call them to get me a glass of water and the server came and offered me water.The food was excellent and you cannot beat this place for steaks !
4
This restaurant is around for more than 50 years. It is kind of somewhat hidden at Holland Village, right at the end, a bit away from the mainstreet.The lunch 3 course set is amazing value at 24 dollars all in. It includes starter, bread and good main and dessert. You can combine it with freshly pressed juices at 3.50 S$.The outdoor seating is very pleasant and the service is good, contrary to many reports written here. It is not super fine dining, but the quality and speed is very good. One of my favorite day-to-day restaurants in Singapore
4
I ordered the set menu with the tenderloin which seemed like a good deal compared to my husband's al la carte Fantastico steak. Both steaks were very good but not outstanding. The set meal included a desert and coffee which was a nice ending to the meal. Drinks were reasonably priced and the service was good. I'm sure we'll be bac
4
When coming to Singapore, we always make at least one stop at Foster's - for tea. Their afternoon tea is superb - the scones fresh from the oven and choices of tea are excellent. The environment is very relaxed and refreshing. (We also ate lunch at another time - it was very good and a bit pricey.) The Staff is always friendly - and helpful

About Foster's, I only have this to say, that it's been around a long time and they have to be given credit for doing the same thing without fiddling with the standard document too much. The restaurant has been Foster’s since 1960, but it of course has not been run continuously by the same ownership over that period of time. The current owners have run fosters for the last 13 years or so and have done a creditable job of keeping standards buoyant in this Holland Village institution, especially one of Foster’s pedigree.Looking over the newspaper styled menu, I notice that there are options, quite a lot of them actually besides grilled steer, which always leads me to be suspicious of a place that calls itself a steakhouse. Of course there are many examples of steakhouse menus that are as varied and abundant as a Bali market bazaar is with knick knacks and still respect their primary business model enough to churn out respectably grilled meat. I'm just saying that I worry, maybe excessively, when I sit down at an establishment that claims to do steaks and look at the menu and see not a short list of bar food, seafood options and a kids menu, that the beef may not be getting the attention that it deserves. The worm of doubt starts squirming, making me wonder if maybe the steaks aren’t going to be that good given the vast inventory of perishables that must be stocked to keep this menu afloat and of course, what the turn over on product, especially the steaks at such a joint would be. I’m just saying that I worry…maybe excessively…maybe needlessly.There is of course an al fresco dining option on the patio, nice enough, but watch out for the mosquitoes. If you’ve read my other reviews, you’ll know that ambience really isn’t an issue for me. I’ll squat in some dung hole if there’s a spiritual experience in a bowl in the offing. I’m just saying that it would’ve been nice for for the fans to have been turned on and maybe more regular visits by the pest-fogging folks. None of this really would’ve registered had the steaks been able to distract me enough.One last caveat before we talk meat. I’ve been coming here for some time but had not had the beef in a while, always finding myself here in the afternoon for a nice cream tea instead.Ok, a word or two about the steaks at Foster’s now.The Wagyu ribeye with an advertised marbling of 8 is ostensibly US beef. The steaks are cut too thin. This has been done to keep the cost of a steak below nose-bleed level, no doubt, but it does beg the question if a Wagyu ribeye should be put on the menu at all, in the first place, if you have to cut it so thin to keep food costs down? It is my considered opinion that to cut steak that thin is just disrespectful to the ingredient. If we can’t afford to eat properly cut Wagyu steaks, we should just not breed and kill Wagyu cattle. The thin cut resulted in a steak that was barely rare and what little flavor harbored in the marbling of that thin cut was almost completely smothered by the sautéed onions it was resting on. You cut meat that thin and rest it on sautéed onions, it could be kangaroo or emu and still passably to the casual eye and palate, be beef. I still enjoyed the steak, but I think nostalgia had more than a little to do with it. I would caution someone with no history with Foster’s against ordering the Wagyu Ribeye.The USDA Ribeye was similarly thinly cut and smothered in the same sautéed onions, too far gone to be able to show off just how good (or bad) this beef actually was. One other thing is that when you cut steaks that thin, the gristle starts to show its not so pleasant face more prominently than it should throughout the gastronomic performance of a steak dinner. Not outright unpleasant, but a little jarring. I suppose if you’re comparing this to what passes for steak at hawker center western food in Singapore, then this is pretty good; but not three times as good because this is what the ribeye costs at Foster’s. Again, I question the valuation of the product and where Foster’s is pitching it’s standard for steak cookery, what it’s target audience might be. Again, my experience here was saved by rose-tinted nostalgia

Had Christmas dinner with family after deciding that this restaurant was the one this year. The food needless to say was excellent, however the service was poor. Just a sum up, no smiles from the staff, seemed overworked. Need to work on this and pay attention to paying customers not one another.

For full review and pictures: http://grumblingstomachs.wordpress.com/Fosters Restaurant is a cozy steakhouse at Holland Village. Located at the end of a row of shop houses, Fosters has a nice alfresco dining area facing away from the bustling main road and walkways.A few days ago, I visited Fosters for the first time with some friends. We were having a lunch gathering for the last time before one of my classmate flies off for her exchange overseas. Thankfully, instead of a sad, weepy farewell lunch, our lunch was still full of our normal banters and laughter. I guess no one could stay sad for long in a restaurant that has such a homely, cozy ambience.Fosters offers lunch sets from 11 am to 2.30 pm daily, but by the time the group of us reached there, it was already nearly 2.30 pm. Prepared to just order from the a la carte menu, we were pleasantly surprised when the waiter told us it was not yet 2.30, and that we should order fast in order to enjoy the lunch sets. I ordered the fillet steak set, which consists of a tenderloin steak in chestnut sauce with mashed potato and vegetables, as well as a dessert and a choice of tea or coffee. This costs $19.90, a price which I found very reasonable.The steak in chestnut sauce had an interesting taste, very different from the usual black pepper or mushroom sauce that I’m used to. The chestnut sauce really contains chestnut bits, which gave the steak an extra unique texture and bite, something that I really enjoyed. The steak, however, was a tad too dry for my liking for a medium well-done steak. After that, we were served our desserts – apple pie with ice cream. I found it just average, with the apple pie tasting slightly sour.But all that can be forgiven, because the appeal of the restaurant really lies in its ambience – the homely feel that simply makes you feel welcomed. To be more specific, Fosters has an extremely warm Christmas feel in its decor. The Christmas lights, the reindeer’s antlers on the walls, and even a fake fireplace. Every detail in the restaurant’s decor contributes to the Christmas-y feeling that you experience from the moment you step into it, making you forget all your worries temporarily, and just feel happy. And not to mention, the waiters there are really nice people too, and hence bringing smiles to customers.For full review and pictures: http://grumblingstomachs.wordpress.com

Lunch dining on a comfortable cool veranda tucked away is a special favorite. Enjoy the ambiance of tropical vines, shade, and very large bees visiting the white trumpet flowers. The seating is comfortable and romantic.All set outside at the back of the main restaurant.A choice of soup, entree, dessert and coffee is unbelievable value. My favorite is always the petite filet steak. Very tender and tasty, The portions for a set lunch are just right .Service is very attentive and pleasant

I love how its is possible to change all the items on high tea set to scones! The set comes with 3 types of spread - butter, jam and cream. Be sure to make reservation if you are dropping by for high tea on a weekend. The cafe fills up real fast and sometimes patrons are being put on a 20 -30 mins waiting list

Long time ago, I often patronize their restaurant back when they were in specialist center, to be fair, the food is good but service is way below expectations . Back then , not sure about now, the owner of this restaurant is from hong kong, n he treats his regular customers very well . Once there was this credit card promotion that offers 1 for 1 dinner, the requirement was to call n reserve but i didn't because it was a last minute decision n when I reach there I was told that the table are fully allocated to this promo deal but restaurant wasn't full n it was 7 pm. While I walk away,I made a call back to e the restaurant n yes, they told me table available for this promo. I walked back n when the owner saw me, he literally turned me away say I cheat...omg..

Heard good reports about Fosters so decided to check it out. Starters were Mushroom Soup and escargot. The soup was so so, way to much onion and was not expecting onions in a mushroom soup. Six escargot were presented in their shells. Three were empty...........brought it to their attention and in fairness they returned with six more ( not in shells) . Partner ordered carpet bag stuffed with oysters and was just so so. I ordered the fillet steak. Meat cooked to perfection but way to salty. Soy sauce had been added with mushrooms and broccoli tossed on top. So this was a beef stir fry with a good cut of beef. Not what we were expecting and won't be returning. The Manager of this place has no social skills whatsoever and should not be running this place. His attitude, remarks and lack of interest were shocking to say the least. Great waiter service though

Food was good. Restaurant decor was nice and cosy. Only downer was the staff. We can hear the kitchen staff talking loudly from where we were sitting (near main entrance). They even have their own music going on in there. Service staff still need lots of training. No smiles, no thank you, arms were crossed when standing around doing nothing, plates were cleared without them even asking if they can clear it, proper cutleries were not set when you order steak and they do not bother if you had enjoyed your meal or not. Service at Swensens would have been better. All these really reflects on the lack of training. I am sure service is one important criteria alot of customers consider when patronizing a restaurant. If you are looking for nice (not fantastic) food and don't give two hoots about service, then you might want to try this restaurant out

Not in vogue but classic. Truly good cooking. If only they had a good wine list...

Western Food at the End Tip of Holland Village.
I like its Cod Fish. Its Pork Sausage is quite saltish for my appetite.
Cosy decor and lightings, with a Live Singer performing as background music --> A romantic ambience is created.

Amid the constant rivalry of the glitz and glamour in Singapore one seldom finds a classic gem such as this. Apart from their great traditional menu including English High Tea, I found Bubble and Squeak!! Seriously? I haven't seen that on a menu in years! It was delicious! They also offer Sunday breakfast (often difficult to find in Singapore unless you go to the hotels). Nestled in a shady quiet corner of Holland Village, Fosters has a special feeling of serenity about it. They are open from 11am to 11pm daily, and yes, they still have a seated smoking section outside. Hooray! My new favourite place, for sure

We found the meat in general to be too heavily salted. My "fillet fantastique" (NZ beef), done medium-rare, was good, but another that was "medium" came out tough and dry. Try the pork chop - amazingly tender and juicy, and the fish and chips are also good. I also enjoy going for their afternoon tea
