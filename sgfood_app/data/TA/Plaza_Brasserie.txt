Staff were so friendly and helpful. Loved all the buffet items. My family usually come here every two months and never get disappointed. The price could be a bit expensive but it's worth all the experience.

Priced lower than some of the other hotel buffets in Orchard/Marina Bay but really good for what you pay. Extensive selections of international food so you will be spoilt for choice!
4
Nice decoration with good service. The restaurant provide lot of selection from cool cuts, appertizer, main course as well
4
Do have wide varieties of selection for the breakfast buffet! Service provided is good. They do replenish the food quite promptly too.

We arrived late at the Pan Pacific Serviced apartments and went out for a small meal near our hotel. We did not waste time, we decided to enter the PARKROYAL on Beach Road and walked to the Brasserie.We both ordered light Singaporean/Malaysian meals and were not disappointed.Mine with a peanut based sate sauce was just so good and my wife's meal was also excellent.Served with speed, ate with a relaxed rush and then to pay. What a surprise, a discount when I showed my Pan Pacific Key.Arriving later in the evening in this area, why wonder go to the Parkroyal

The Crab buffet was ok . A little bit tasteless to my liking..especially the chili crab , salted egg & cereal crab. To my amazement, they never crush the pincer & makes my dining experience very difficult although they provide the nut cracker.. Ask the Chef why didn't do it since I've been eating crab all my life, his answer is the crab will break!! Huh? Anw the service was pretty efficient especially Shanil the trainee, & some of the aunties & uncles ..won't come back again for the crab buffet unless some improvements.

The plaza brasserie offers a huge selection of food from the buffet. There is also an a la carte menu. There is a wide choice of local food but the do cater for everyone's taste. The restaurant gets busy at the weekend so be sure to book.The breakfast is second to none with more choice than you could possibly imagin

We are staying at the Park Royal on Beach Road and thought it would be a good idea to eat in the hotel on New Years Eve as the service we had received in our first few days in Singapore had been excellent. Unfortunately the same could not be said about the Plaza Brasserie! Upon arrival we were shown to a table and left with no instructions on how the buffet worked and no enquiry if we would like any drinks. We had to ask one of the staff hanging around at the counter doing nothing! We eventually went round to the food and we were bitterly disappointed! There was very little left! One of our party is not a great seafood eater and was expecting to eat salads and then the roasted meats and vegetables - very little salads left and the meats were cold and dried up! The vegetables were sigh as if they had been sitting for quite some time! We didn't see a single potato as advertised on the menu the whole two hours we were there. There were very few prawns left for the others in the party either. When two of us asked the chef for a couple of oysters he looked disgruntled and threw them in the plate. There were no desserts left at the end and to add insult to injury the bill came to $440. We did t have very much to eat and one of us actually had next to nothing. Very very disappointed
1
Not much of a selection and even if there is, not meant for us as a Muslim. They had nasi lemak but with a non-halal chicken wing. The nasi lemak was served in a bowl which to me seems inappropriate. The chef was not friendly at all. Had to asked them a couple of times for services. So not professional! I even asked the waiter for further clarification on the food served but was answered in a "could not be bothered" manner. How rude! Will surely not come here again...the only reason we were here is because of my hubby's meeting
3
Many different cooking styles for the crab including chilli, black pepper, miso, rock sugar , salted egg yolk, petai, kimchi, Assam Better tasting ones were the Assam and egg yolk versions . However crabs not fresh some tasted bitter. Most had a flat taste. For that was a bit disappointed as there were not much of anything else to eat besides crabs. Only Plus point is that there is salmon sashimi however would not have gone for it if I knew the quality of the crabs were like that .
5
Good taste, great variety and prompt service from the staff.
I recommend this to all guests staying, particularly those staying a while but also to those not staying at the hotel. A good dining option.
4
Nice choice of food continental and Asian, people will find almost all the tastes. staff is good and helpful.
5
Definitely a must try. Large variety of crab flavours and many other dishes also. Price is reasonable too.
5
Part of my staycation over Labour Day - was a good and diverse spread for breakfast which included many local favourites.
5
Plaza Brasserie served the ultimate crab feast for a couple of months a year, and this year my husband and I caught the season and went for the feast. They have a promo rate of SGD99 for 2 pax on Mon-Wed, which was worth the price. More than 10 type of crab cooking styles to choose from, as well as fresh oysters (husband gave thumbs up), sashimi, and other local food. I highly recommend the Ginger Broth Crab. I ain't gonna say much, go try it out!Service was excellent. We were served water right after we were seated. Plates were also cleared fast and water promptly refilled, despite the restaurant was almost full house
4
alarge spacious cafe which is laden to the hilt with food. alas if you are gluten free and vegetarian, you are left to fnd for yourself. you will starve. the chefs dont care, except Chef Ken who was a nice man but we met him only once. rest of the staff does not care. No one cares. if you love meat, this is paradise.a commercially run place. if you want care and attention to your needs, run far awa
3
bad service and made my day so unhappy.During lunch we put aside few tea bags for drinking,to my horror a male manager(the moment we step in he never smile at all) came and say if we wanted to bring out we must pay (as if we are thief)I was so shocked that i couldnt answer him.We felt very embarrassed.Immedately he took the tea bag and gave us a big pot of tea with only 1 tea bag, I told him I would like more he tell me off to get myself and walk off.I will never recommend to all my friends to such a place.This guy need training if he wish to be in F and B, such bad attitude
3
Too many crab dishes and after trying them can't tell the difference anymore. Some of the crab dishes have been at the counter for long and became cold . Limited dessert and the cakes are terrible. Best dish was the steamed fish . The customer service can be improved . The kitchen staff was unwilling to take my order. The service staff could smile more.
4
Went for the crab buffet dinner. The spread was good with a good variety of seafood like oyster, shellfish and roast poultry. There is a total of 8 different types of crab offered. Other than the pricier cost per pax, it is worth a visit. Four stars only because you can get a more worthy spread with a more affordable price at a more higher class restaurant minus the crabs
4
This offers a great buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The lunch and dinner buffets were a bit expensive for my taste. All three meals offer a great variety and you can always order a la carte to get very good food at a more reasonable price. Great service, too
5
Had free breakfast with stay, Buffet, open 6am to 10.30am, plenty of choice and variety. Really enjoyed it
4
Had the buffet here a few times and always good variety and plenty of it. Service pleasant and friendly and also the a la carte menu is varied and not badly priced for normal hotel prices.
5
Currently staying at the Park Royal and can't fault the staff, friendly, helpful, and the breakfast in the Brasserie caters for all tastes both western and eastern.
3
Service was very good and for the price you get a fair amount of choice but crabs are kept warm so we're only juicy and fresh for the first 30 minutes or so
4
Had dinner with 2 of my colleagues last night to try the freshest catch fish buffett.the salmon fish head cooked in black bean sauce was awesome the steamed grouper in hong kong style was excellent -fresh and perfect. Oysters were GOOD.. Laksa was nice. not too over powering in flavour Did not get a chance to try the curry fish head as we had no room in the tummy for some more food.. value for money with the 20% discount using UOB cards. worth trying if you enjoy eating fish.will be visiting Plaza Brasserie with more colleagues in April to try the curry fish head

Was here one Saturday evening with extended family for dinner.Their website says that the cuisine time is "Local, International" so we were expecting variety. However, what we saw was mostly local (Chinese, Indian) and Japanese (Sushi and Sashimi). Perhaps the "continental" (mentioned on another part of their website) was represented by the various types of cheese, and maybe "western" was represented by the salads.We felt that the variety here was much less than the LIME Restaurant at ParkRoyal on Pickering. It was a shame because the last time we ate here (probably about 2 years back) they had much more variety.The Sashimi here was not very tasty. Several of our family members commented that the Salmon Sashimi was a little too "hard" for their liking (compared to those we get from good Japanese restaurants.)The Softshell Crab (another of our favorite dish when we visit Japanese restaurants) turned out to be oily and not nice.The Black Pepper Crab was a mixed bag. My wife, who is an avid crab-eater, felt that the crab was not fresh: some of the crab's meat felt soggy, others were soft and without the typical "bounciness" you expect in fresh crab meat.The steamed Sea Bass, which they steamed on request, was fresh. And they served the whole fish in a Chinese Restaurant style, which was a pleasant surprise.The Laksa was not as good as we'd expected. The gravy seemed diluted and lack texture. In comparison, we felt that even the pre-packed "Prima Taste" Laksa (which you can easily get in major supermarkets) had richer taste and texture.The other local food were generally OK, though again we were rather disappointed in the lack of variety. For example, there were only one dish of vegetables (you'd expect several different dishes of vegetables in a buffet restaurant).The cheese were tasty. They actually labeled all the cheese so you won't have to guess which is which, and we were glad they did.The desserts were generally nice, though we were quite disappointed in the limited variety.We were surprised that a number of the dishes were labeled Gluten-free. While we don't really care about Gluten-free food, we appreciate the fact that they labeled it so that those who need Gluten-free diet can eat with confidence here.The service was faultless. We've found the staff to be prompt, friendly, and attentive.We came here because we liked the food here the previous times we visited. But this visit we walked away feeling disappointed. While the price we paid were reasonable (for similar restaurants in similar class of hotels), we felt that the standard of food, and the variety, was not as good as our last visit

I went there a couple of times in previous years, really liked the dessert selection then. They used to have chocolate fondue. Their Indian food section used to have more variety too. (Now they only have curries and crab) When I went there yesterday with my family, fondue was replaced with doughnuts (not the fluffy kind, the cake kind) and other desserts. The durian paste (forgot the actual name) was nice and had actual durian flavour, the chocolate cake and tiramisu cake were both very light and was a bit tasteless. Flavour of the chocolate cake comes only from the cocoa powder dusted on the top layer. For the sashimi, I tried the salmon and tuna only. Tuna was very watery? but still acceptable (perhaps water from melted ice) Salmon however tasted weird to me, seemed a bit harder this time around. (compared to the previous times i ate at this restaurant and other Japanese places like Sushi Tei, Sakae Sushi and Ichiban Sushi) The person serving the sashimi seemed to be taking his own sweet time slicing the fish. Ice cream section had more toppings this time round, but sadly didn't have chocolate (my favourite flavour haha). However, they had other interesting ones which were really nice. I tried the green tea and durian ice cream. (they also had raisin and vanilla). Their cheese section had more variety, which was nice! Waiters clearing our tables were really prompt. Overall, I would not come back here again, I feel that the buffet at Park Royal on Pickering has more variety and better quality

I went for their Ultimate Crab Feast buffet this time!While there is so many selection of all sorts of crabs, like Honey crab, curry type, teochew style, cold crabs etc, The butter oat or cereal crab is blend and I rather have a cereal/oat biscuit instead (by the way, I dislike eating such biscuits) Freshness has to be the key to a food industry, they should cook in smaller portion(or at least monitor the no. of guests dining) , rather than cooking so much and let the crab warmed by warmer for so long!While seafood (like seabass fish is well steamed and it is their signature dish too) seemed to be their focus, they bring in TOO MUCH SALT FROM THE SEA, some of the items are way to salty! eg the roti prata curry sauce (fish) and the pepper crab etc, are just too salty! It is a surprise that they do a decent job to their roasted meat selection and hainanese chicken and traditional hong kong brewed lotus root soup tooNotably, they served jackfruit ice-cream, I didn't know that there is such kind of ice-cream!The other bonus is they do NOT even limit the quantity you want, you can have as many signature dish you wanted too! Though we are spoilt by the large selection of choices, the hotel/restaurant should be more focused and to dish out the best...Quality is MORE important than quantity, isn't it?They even served braised sea cucumber, though there aren't any oysters for the price we are paying at S$78++ eachNevertheless that is still a very good attempt as most buffets in Singapore could not even make a 60% mark, they easily nail 70%! Service is prompt too and Enjoy a 10% discount off buffets with a UOB, ANZ, DBS/POSB, HSBC, Maybank or OCBC credit/debit car

We were staying at the ParkRoyal on Beech Rd Hotel and ate at the Brasserie at lunchtime.The food and the service were very good. Prices were a little expensive but I guess they are normal for a Singapore Hotel.We would certainly eat there again while staying in the restaurant
2
After reading all the good reviews on the crab buffet, I made my reservation when they open their crab buffet offer. The buffet starts at 6pm for dinner. Staff seated the guest at 5.50pm. Though they told us the buffet will start at 6pm, many hungry guest already start taking the food. By 6pm, you can see most of them started to eat. Everyone just like mad people trying to get all the crab available. On my first round of taking the food, the crabs were quite big. After the refilling, the size of the crab shrink. Out of the 10 different choices of the crabs, the black pepper one tasted the best. The oats crab has burnt taste. And their tang gui crab is noting like the promotional pictures. This buffet cost almost $100 after the service charge & tax. Definitely not worth the value
5
Located inside Park Royal, if you wake up early and need to go out or check out, you just inform plaza brasserie about it and they will pack your meals and ready to serve round the clock
4
Buffet dinner noted with not many verities as compared to Park Royal Restaurant at Kitchener road. However quality of food is up to the mark. Service staffs are friendly .
4
Quality and variety of food was good. I was impressed that they even served freshly squeezed juices.
Service staff was polite and friendly and was very proactive in serving us. Will go back to try other food or just for their breakfast.
5
Wide range of variety of food for selection. Uses fresh ingredients especially shashimi. Nice ambience with excellent service rendered. I will definitely dine again at Plaza Brasserie
5
Every time there is suprise when back here for buffet... this time, they hv a "Live" meringue station....good job to the creative FnB team....

We had our first and last experience today at Plaza Brasserie , crab feast buffet . It was absolutely crappy & disgusting . Here's why :1) We had a man doing diaper change for his son ( about 4 years old right in the center of the dining area , right at the peak of the buffet period) Two couples who had the unobstructed view of this horrible disgusting scene left within a few minutes - probably unable to eat any more after the view they've had ( one Indonesian couple and one Angmoh couple ) None of the water/waitresses or the 2 ladies at the buffet reception counter said anything at all , they just looked and pretended to be busy !! We are parents too , but have never ever done / seen anyone do this before .2) If this wasn't enough , we had a 4-5 year old boy WITH DIRTY SHOES being carried around by his dad brushing over everyone's heads seated at tables . He was also throwing him up in the air ( Still with dirty blackish soled shoes) and playing with him when he had eaten . We were still eating :) , this was happening right next to the buffet reservation counter , in the central dining area , on the way to the plate clearing station.3) At the same time , there was a maid with 2 kids in a stroller using the dining floor as a park to stroll around the tables and pause to peek at what everyone was eating !! 4) We made this reservation last week but we were given a table that had its seating popping out unlike all other into the centre isle. When we requested for a change , we were told that all other tables were already taken. We saw two tables for 4 and another for two unoccupied but with the 'reserved' sign. No one sat at these tables until the end of the buffet time ~2.20 pm, they were empty all the while !! Another couple who came later than us and asked for a change of table and they were immediately given a good window view table without any hesitation. Fair ??? Plus , we were not the last name on the reservation list , our name was somewhere in the middle of the list but looks like there is a lot of partiality here even when you pay like what others do :(This is the worst buffet ambience I've ever experienced , totally unethical , no table manners and no one cares at all !! So if you really want to eat peacefully and enjoy your food without having to see disgusting diaper changes or without having dirt from kids shoes in your food or your heads, DO NOT GO HERE !!!And , one more thing, the food was just average , NOTHING outstanding like the other reviews that I read

This was probably the best seafood buffet I have had but... It's still a buffet and I wasn't impressed with the crab selection which was why I went. The fried shrimp were great, scallop dish was good. Sushi was good, I would go back again if in Singapore. That said, I went for the advertising of it being a buffet of the local crab dishes (e.g. Chili crab, pepper crab , etc.). They only had one crab option (salted egg yolk crab) on the Sunday night I went and the crabs were smaller and didn't seem as fresh as the chili crab I had the night before. I did enjoy the sauce and managed to make quite a mess of myself and my napkin which is to be expected.. Also, no dipping bread that I saw
4
Great selection of buffet items. If you love Roast everything, then this is the place to be! They have Roast Wagyu Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Pork Knuckle, Baked Bone marrow, braised Ox Tongue and even Kangaroo Tail! They also have this gastronomical dessert that is like dry ice, though i never tried it, people seem amazed by it. I absolutely loved their coconut ice cream!Service staff were polite and accommodating, chefs can improve on their interaction skills as some of them seem not so interested and just talk with their colleagues at the corner. another thing to note is though they close at 1030pm they start clearing their items by 10pm especially the dessert area. I even saw one chef taking some food on the buffet counter before 10, which i suppose is for his own consumption. Buffet Price: $65++ available for dinnerTip: Do come early if you want to enjoy all the items
5
Delicious breakfast buffet... We ate there twice. The first time, my 2 yr old was not offered a child's cup, utensils or plate, so I assumed they didn't have them. The second time, a nice older gentlemen who seemed to be the manager, brought them over, it would have been nice to have the first time. But otherwise a great and delicious breakfast with lots of western options
4
After hearing so much about their seasonal crab buffet, I have decided to try out which is only offered for dinner. as weekday & weekend rates r the same, weekends are fully taken up & weekdays are left with certain days only. As we fancy huge crab so we are not really impressed with it. having say that, it is still an overall value good for money consider the good variety of fresh seafood. gd variety of crabs cooked in diff style, fresh oyster regularly top up, sashimi & fish are served fresh on demand. some interesting dessert like durian puree, fig & honey ice cream with toppings. ask for complementary parking,all credit cards have 15% discount. but crab buffet is really a v tiring affair, hands & mouth are kept busy...hardwork
4
Warm welcome and food is nice. I have tried buffet breakfast. I have asked something new or customized instead of buffet which is available on the table and the chefs happily cooked in front of me. Nice experience.
5
The Brasserie is truly a remarkable in its service and choice and quality of food. One of the best I've experienced. The buffet price is less than at other 4-5 star hotels, and it's quality and choice just as good. Want to complement the patient, hardworking and smiling staff
3
New buffet spread promises live cooking stations that prepare seafood such as snapper, grouper, clams, mussels and crabs in a variety of chinese styles.Really quite impressive number of dishes, although I wouldn't say quality is the best. Amazing sashimi though, very fat and melts in your mouth
4
Nicely designed hotel restaurant for breakfast and a good selection of hot and cold food options. The staff were friendly and provided efficient service. Whilst it was busy during the breakfast hours it did not feel over crowded and there was always a good selection of food throughout
5
I have eaten meals numerous times and tried both a la carte and the buffet, you only say one thing the food is excellent and the only thing that is better than the food is the polite efficient friendly service provided by all staff; from the minute you walk in the door until you leave it is just simply a pleasure to be in their company.Simple it is a must do experience in Singapore
5
Re-visited the restaurant, alot of improvement have been done to the restaurant.The FnB team did a good job, the whole restaurant looks so much better compared to my last visit. My favourite is still the soft shell crab, durian prata and their promotion "HK style steam fish". Staffs were very attentive and friendly
4
Had my child's first birthday party at the restaurant. Booked in advance and replied from the staff were prompt and friendly. Buffet spread is considerably good for the price. Chose this place as it has a range of food for the young and old. Has been a place for gatherings/birthday/farewell many years! Traditional way of making prata! The kind where they fluff up the prata after cooking it. Softball crab from hot food section also something to look forward to. Service staff are friendly and attentive. A nice place to bring friends and family.
4
This restaurant is better than the other inhouse restaurant. But not much. The only upside to it is that you can either go a la carte or do the buffet. They at least have more choices buffet style. I haven't tried the a la carte menu yet
4
Besides crabs, there's also a selection of other buffet items such as fresh seafood, Asian delight and a dim sum corner. There's a variety of different flavour crabs to choose from in giant pots and we were spoilt from choices. The salted egg yolk crabs is still my favourite out of all. The crabs weren't fantastic but average as some of the meats were not fresh enough. Some of the items were above average while some fell short, but It's still a good deal for getting such a wide selection of buffet items for that amount you're paying. A visit to Plaza Brasserie's Crab Feast is a must for crab lovers, nothing beats than to indulge in unlimited servings of crabs with different flavours, as well as seafood, sushi and desserts. I must say it's one of the most value for money buffets in town!
3
I ate here 3 times during a recent stay at the adjoining hote. first visit was for dinner, late (10pm) and I felt the food was overpriced and low in volume. Taste wise it was good without being great. I also had two bbreakfasts here. The buffet had a lot of choice with a nice blend of Asian and European food. Quality wise it was not bad, however you could find much tastier at a hawker centr
4
We enjoyed the breakfast we had at Parkroyal on Beach Road, Singapore. There was plenty of food selection, and we found the surrounding were pleasant.
5
Really enjoyed our buffet, there is such a wide variety from so many different roasts to seafood galore, salads cakes deserts and it even had its own ice cream freezer with so many flavours and all the trimmings.
4
Fresh and quality food with excellent staff for your service. There is something for everyone at parkroyal.
Highly recommended!
5
Plaza Brasserie is an Excellent Restaurant where we had breakfast everyday. Only thing was we felt there could be more choice for vegetarian food and especially indian vegetarian food. Otherwise, the place is excellent with great service!
4
While somewhat pricey the food available is wide ranging Asian focus for the buffet. Non buffet menu available also. Food is fresh and service friendly. Wine list is on expensive side. Breakfast buffet very good value for a hotel as process usually higher in hotels.. Exceptional range of options. Fresh juices on the spot. Eggs cooked on spot to order. Reliable eating. Have stayed here on at least 5 occasions over last 3 to 4 years
4
Was there to celebrate my mum's birthday. Reservations was made a week earlier via hotel's website. Received a confirmation email the following day. Although it was a week night, the hotel was about half full. Service was superb. Plates were cleared almost immediately and plain water was top up frequently.Staff always had a smile on them. It was crab feast buffet so there were at least 8 types of crabs cooked in different ways. Sashimi selection was very fresh. Oysters were shucked only when needed. We went there in 3 cars and we all had complimentary carpark coupons for it. Only thing was I had informed reservations earlier that I would like to have a piece of cake for my mum since it's her birthday. However when I spoke to the staff, he wasn't aware. So he just took 1 piece of cake and some smaller pieces together from the desert bar. They could provide candles but it was not lighted when served as he doesn't have a lighter. I think that's 1 little thing which the restaurant might want to look into as I'm sure we are not the only ones celebrating birthdays there. Overall definately good experience and will be back
3
Tried out the crab feast. Various of crabs cooked in different flavors. Decent selection of food. Salmon and Tuna sashimi was very fresh. Oysters were availbale too. Shocker was one of the forks on the table had been used before. Informed the staff whom quickly replaced it
5
Plaza Brasserie has a fresh of variety of Asian food and Western food, such as Nasi Lemak, Fish ball noodle soup, Prawn noodle soup, Sushi, and Omelette including fresh handmade of carrot juice. They also serve food for vegetarian and Indian food too. The breakfast is value for money. Thank you for the excellent food and services
5
Plaza Brasserie serves a variety of food for all nationalities. I was surprised they even serve "Caviars" as topping on some delicatenesses unknown to somebody not familiar with it. The people are friendly and very accommodating. I was surprise someone recognizes me at some point as I make sure I stayed in this hotel and dine at this restaurant whenever I visit Singapore. My congratulations to its Management and Staff
4
Plaza Brassserie at ParkRoyal on beach road is an excellent place to have food. It offers a wide range of dishes for vegetarians too... I being totally vegie found no problems in getting a nice meal during my stay there. Staff at brasserie is too coordial & friendly. It was really nice to have spent time at Plaza Brasserie. The best place to have a tasty and variety food
4
Always impressed will the selection and quality on the buffet. My all time favourite are soft shell crab, durian roti prata, roast duck and sashimi counter. Not forgetting the friendly service staffs working there.It's an excellent place for group dining and family gathering.
5
I woud recommend this hotel to everyone. it is very clean and staff are ever so helpful and friendly. They help you in every possible way and wil change standard meals.
4
decent variety at a reasonable price, but nothing stands out
4
The food were fresh n delicious. The oysters were BIG & fresh as they were opened on the spot. The oyster omelette was tasty, the sashimi were fresh too, generous with the portion as well. The roti prata were handmade & not instant & yummy together with the fishcurry or vegetable curry. Both taste just as good.It was Thai feast when I went. I do not fancy Thai food, so not much comment but the rice was good n tasty.They had durian paste which I guess it is just pure durian without seed. Taste real good on its own. Potato soup was creamy and tasty. Siew Mai is jus so-so. Didn't see much variety for ice cream so I didn't bother to try. Moreover, I m not a dessert fan.The location of the hotel is 10-15 mins walk from mrt which is link to a run down shopping mall, the hotel and mall just don't blend. Worth a second visit as we were there for an OCBC 1-for-1promo. Each paid abt sg$50
5
most distinctive feature is its spacious setting. it relaxes you to enjoy a value local meal or just a drink. buffet main dishes are relatively more tasty among most buffets in hotels which i usually avoid. my favourite starters are sushimi before indulging in softshell crab and local fried rice. butter crab is very tasty if it is served. complete the meal with deep fried fish and assortment of salad and local dessert. i am definitely going back
3
It offered a better variety for breakfast than other hotels I have stayed here in Singapore. The problem I got is that it is too commercialized. No server is visible to assist you and attend to your needs. Their breakfast is too westernized aside from a selected few that is truly local. When I travel, I prefer to have a slice of local cuisine than what I can get at home
4
Had a great ambience, if you are late you could have sit in a 1 meters length table, well enough for you and ur partner. Sashimi counter was generous enough, Tempura and Soft Shell crabs was decent and surprisingly food of the day was the Prata and its Fish curry, I could have say its best in town. Desserts is again focussing on a local desserts like chin chow with longan, Fondue chocolate was a lil bit too much of its cocoa butter, can taste the repeated melted chocolate from couple days back. Self service Ice cream counter is great with a little child decorations and unique. One thing unique about this place is the coffee and tea also in a buffet counter unlike other buffet restaurant. Worth a try especially for tourist, diners mostly are local. Service staff attentive on clearing your plates, can add a little smile would be perfect :) Overall worth a try!!

As a restaurant within a hotel, it's obvious that besides the need of being value for money, the service and its atmosphere must also be up to the standard of a hotel. However, I believed I've seen none of the above mentioned qualities for this restaurant.As a first timer to the restaurant, I've promptly made a booking the day before to avoid disappointment. Then on the actual day itself, knowing the complexity of locating the hotel, I made an extra effort to go there early. And after several futile searches for the hotel location and entrance, I tried making a series of calls to the restaurant for assistance. To my horror, the restaurant's number was engaged for a continuous 1 hour and there was no routing to any other assistance! Worst, the restaurant did not even bother to make an effort to call back to ask for further instruction when I didn't turn up after the mentioned time. As a result, I've no choice but to head home with utterly disappointment. Having the above mentioned experience, I believed I would not recommend and will not be visiting this place again to avoid another disappointment
4
We enjoyed the international asia mix dinner buffet. Food is nice - interesting salad station with a lot of side choice. At chef station : crab, BBQ station, baked salmon, oyster, sushi and sashimi station served with friendly chef. Chicken rice and soft shell crab must try
3
I had a dinner buffet here in the middle of July, 2009. The food and presentation were quite ordinary and the levels of staff service and friendliness were definitely below average.The outlet is part of the Plaza Parkroyal Hotel on Beach Road and the service in the hotel is also quite ordinary, even by Singaporean standards. The waiters or manager didn't seem too pleased about me taking my time with the buffet and in the end, did not clear the dishes or fill up my glass with water. I took about one hour to finish the buffet and consumed quite a standard amount.The only exciting part of the dinner buffet was the freshly cooked section, where I could get freshly cut sashimi as well as cooked-to-order meals such as the udon and other noodles section. However, the cost of the buffet was quite high at around S$45 nett and, in summary, I don't think it was quite worth it, especially considering the less than satisfactory attitude(s)
