Great food within an old public housing neighbourhood. The food is fantastic and the prices totally affordable. Make a reservation if you want the choicest items on their menu.

What a unique place to have hong kong food. Try their noodles, soup and fried, fried chicken. Taste very yummy. This is the original restaurant. Accessible by car or bus.

Ordered a sweet sour pork, the meat pieces is not crispy and the vegetable and sauce is miserable. There is no tomatoes or pineapple. The baby kalian lacks the crunch.

This is a branch of the Old Chun Kee brand but it is an old branch so the taste had been maintained very close to the original shop. Always like their signature dish the hor-fun and bee-hoon soup.

Been here a few times. The variety of dishes are amazing, it is your typucal zi char at a coffee shop in hidden hdb market. There are many individual dishes to select and they are inexpensive ..less than $8. Portion is good and taste delicious. We also have family birthday here...ordered prawns, vegetables, meat, etc...and they cost a fraction of the prices at restaurant like crystal jade, etc..good for dinner or supper. Easy walk from commonwealth mrt. Walk towards the industrial building, pass a church and look for shop houses and then at one end is an old coffee shop. I think rental is lower and now most good food operators will move to older hdb estates to surviv

If you wish to have good zichar (Chinese cook-to-order street food) food and service - whether to take away and dine in - I recommend Hong Kong Street Old Chun Kee at Commonweath Drive. Around the corner from them is the more famous and popular Two Chefs zichar - always with a line - but I'd rather Old Chun Kee.The place is a old styled coffee shop with ambience nothing to shout about unless you are into old Singapore charm. But the food is good. Hong Kong Street is a franchise zichar is several parts of Singapore and famous for their sam hor fun (hor fun with sliced fish and bean sprouts), Fried or Soup Crab Bee Hoon, har chong (prawn paste) fried chicken wings and Fish Head soup or curry. Old Chun Kee does all these and more very well.These have been my family's staple takeaways as alternative to a home-cooked Chinese meal. The quality and taste have always been consistently good. When we have a pot luck party at someone's house, we order tubs of the fried chicken wings. The car may smell of the prawn paste in transit but everyone's not only happy with the wings but asking for more. Definitely no leftovers which is good to air the car on the way back.Last night, I tried their seafood white beehoon. They were very generous with the fresh prawns and clams; which must have contributed to the natural sweetness of the gravy along with plenty of cabbage.The stall is busy especially over the weekend but their service is always attentive and pleasant. This is why I prefer to takeaway which is always prompt. Despite their popularity, their prices have remained inexpensive for their quality and quantity.I cant vouch for all the Hong Kong Street outlets but I certainly recommend the Old Chun Kee branch at Commonwealth Drive

It's a simple place. The prices are a little more than a hawker. The food is a little better than a hawker. Our food was good. The proportions were smaller than we expected but good enough. The food tasted good. We had Lemon Chicken and also Kailon with a side of rice. It was a good meal to split between 2 people who want to eat lightly for a total of SGD$18.50. I'd only give this place 3 stars but they were so nice and helpful so they deserve 4 stars for that. Despite it being a good place, there's no reason anyone should make it a point to go here. We won't be going back. We'll try other places

The original stall at the coffee shop, started this dish over 25 years ago with huge chunky tioman fish slices/fillet. It is widely copied, where most other stalls deep fried the fishes. This stall had the fishes likely sauteed, retaining the original texture & flavor. Will have a soup with bitter gourd plus a bowl of rice. I am satisfied

The food court style Chinese restaurant is nicely positioned in the Holland hill area on one of the old low HDB houses.The restaurant is full and the staff is friendly however most staff doesn't speak English. We ordered lemon chicken and black pepper beef. Accompanied by chicken fried rice and plain rice. A point of net to go with it.The black pepper beef was nice and spicy, however the quality of the meat could be better. The lemon chicken was not great with also the quality of the meat being the problem. Rice was ok and the beer cold.The restaurant clearly saves on not buying the best quality ingredients for its clients. Thats a pity as the cooking is generally good
