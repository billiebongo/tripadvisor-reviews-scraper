the food here is really decent, albeit rather expensive given the small serving portions. nonetheless, the taste is authentic. i'm not sure if they add alot of MSG though, as all of us were really thirsty afterwards.

One of the better Thai restaurants. However in term of taste, i think not very authentic anymore.

This is a review for the Siglap branch. It was my first time to eat in a Thai resto here in Singapore and it was a pleasant dining experience. Service was efficient and the food was quite tasty. Among the food we ordered, I liked the Tom Yam soup and the Garlic Prawns
