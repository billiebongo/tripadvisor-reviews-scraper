Drinks are worth it during their happy hours and promotion. Food are fairly good but be sure to make reservation for Friday night as it will be very crowded and seats are limited.

It was a great night with the staffs being Super helpful with my changed reservation.
Thank you Chope for helping to secure seats on a busy Friday night!

Visited on a Friday late night hence the bar was really crowded. Got a bit too loud to have a casual conversation with my friends. But cocktails are great!
