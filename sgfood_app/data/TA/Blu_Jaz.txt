The place can get busy and packed at night. The food is good. I ordered the aglio olio. A good place worth visit if you like Jazz as they have live band.
4
like the jazz performance by random bands/ singers. best to be there before 8pm, otherwise it is hard to get seats.
5
Cheap and Intoxicating drinks.
Friendly crowd and staff.
Stirring live music in a lively heritage neighbourhood.
Highly recommended
4
A popular chill out place along beach road and Bali lane. Offer both in door and out door seating! Good choice are wings and hummus with bread to goes with drinks.

Ordered a salad and shawarma with lots of juices, all were very good. Music was excellent! Will be a fave stop for me from now on in Singapore.
4
Their jazz performers are very good! The food and the overall ambience of the place is also nice. It just gets too crowded on late weekends and the waiting time is long too, I hope they can do something about it. Still, it's a great place to hangout
4
A great place to chill out, have a beer and listen to jazz. A good friendly bar - relaxed. There are lots of places to eat around this location, so did not try the food but good music with a nice vibe. Ended up meeting lots of new people, so a good place to spend an evening
5
I visited Blu Jaz mid January. It was actually just a random place we sat down in after a long day in the heat - but what a surprise! We enjoyed lovely food, and good drinks the whole evening. The day after, we invited our whole school (since we were on a school trip) to Blu Jaz. We were served the best shawarma and the staff were extremely helpful and nice - even though we were 30 guests
4
We really enjoyed our evening here as it was so nice to sit and watch live jazz music. The food is ok but nothing particularly special. I had the falafel dish, which was fine: perfectly edible but not the best falafel pita I've ever had. Was a bit disappointed with the steak that my partner ordered. It wasn't cheap and although he said the steak itself was cooked very nicely, the amount of mash he was given was honestly a joke. There was barely one tablespoon of mash and about three little chunks of vegetables. It was an incredibly stingy portion and when I raised this with our waiter, he tried charging us more for extra mash and told us we could pay extra or that was it. Then he scuttled away and barely came near our table again, probably out of embarrassment as even he must have known that the dinner was pretty much just a steak and nothing else. Which wouldn't even be such a bad thing if it was a big steak at least! Come here for the music and a drink but eat somewhere else first
4
Both had burgers whilst sat outside (under a veranda) on our last night in Singapore. A nice end to the holiday. Good atmosphere and reasonable price for two meals and a drink each in Singapore (S$50-60). Some live music was about to come on as we left - had a reasonably early flight so felt we had to get home so unfortunately missed it
5
This is a cool little bar and eatery just off Haji Lane. Food is fresh and tasty and the staff are super friendly with prompt service. On a Saturday afternoon they have a great Jazz Band playing live, a great way to spend the afternoon.
4
Come here often when visiting Arab Street. Colorful murals, welcoming staff. Haven't had dinner here--only the finger food, which is fine.
5
Cheap delicious finger food. Wine was expensive as is everywhere in Singapore. Lovely little laneway decorated by graffiti artists.

We arranged a private party which started at 7pm and lasted about 3.5 hours. We were situated at the 2nd level. The food was served at the balcony. There were Burrito, Nachos, Humus, Pizza, Beef & Chicken Kebab, Chicken wings ; well the food was nice, but the drinks were not so much.I ordered a singapore sling, and it tasted like a juice. Next i tried to have the ‘sex on the beach’ and it became much juicer! Then, my friends asked for a jug of mojito, which was filled with ice - after pouring 3 glasses the jug is empty of alcohol, leaving it filled with ice.At 9.30 the bar was open to the public. The DJ started playing songs, but seems to be having trouble getting to pump up the beat. He plays songs from 70’s then 2000’s then back to 80’s again. Its like Beyonce’ back to back with Elvis Presly. I couldn’t get the beat up in my bones. But, as the night goes down, more people came-in and started to feel like a party. Thanks to all of those guys who enjoyed dancing on whatever music was playing. The dance floor is small but it great coz it does not feel empty most of the time. You’ll always feel like dancing to whatever music is on, even if its the 60’s. :)Overall, its okay.Thank
4
Located at Bali lane near beach road and opposite the new Duo residence is this pub and restaurant all into one! The have both in door and out door sitting and offer some good foods for friends to gather and chill out after a day of hard work! BRTon
3
This is a local stop for any Jazz enthusiast and worth a visit. Down a side street with a number of other bars you're unlikely to stumble across it. Busy, lots of people turnover just having a drink to 'experience it'. Place was ok. Food didn't look too appealing but go for the music and a beer.
2
The ambience of this place is good, and there is live music. However, if you are hoping to have a good cocktail you will be disappointed. We had Zombies and Long Island Iced Teas. They were all very weak, not properly done as you would expect in any place that knows how to do cocktails. They tasted like they had almost no alcohol in them. After 3 of these cocktails each, and spending around $120 in this place, we did not feel like we had any drink at all. We mentioned it to the waiter twice, nothing happened. Do yourself a favour and have drinks elsewhere before going to Blu Jaz
4
Great place for breakfast, lunch, or a great evening bar with good meals, really lively place. In the Arab quarter really close to our hotel, this was a great find. We are there most days. Juices and breakfast as well as superb coffee was made in their next door venue, juice clini
4
we found this place by accident. after visiting Singapore for the sixth time, we were disappointed with our regular hang out. a quick google search and we found Blu jaz.different live entertainment every night. most of them were excellent. a very relaxed and great value complex in a vibrant entertainment area, with an extensive food and drink choice
5
Like to express my heartfelt thank you to you and your team . Am grateful to know this venue through Raymond (from the Mexico kitchen ). Me and my team had an wonderful night that day.Thank you for the excellent service that you guys rendered.Will definitely have more events with you guys in the coming year.Will also recommend to my friends who like to hold any event .
5
I live in Singapore but this was my first visit and I have to say, the bar and the surrounding are oozes character and fun. Well worth popping by an d relaxing to a bit of jazz.
4
Blu Jaz is a Singapore classic. Live music, good atmosphere, reasonable prices for drinks. A nice place to meet and spend the evening. Outdoor and indoor seating available.
5
It is a nice restaurant with live music. The terrace outside is good and can listen to the music.
Food in really nice and cheap. Also they have Heineken or Tiger Draft, good price.
4
A nice place to have dinner. Good food, good service. Live jazz music was playing in the evening. Reasonable prices.
5
My daughter recently turned 18 and we had about 70 teenagers and 10 adults at Blu Jaz, Level 3 - it was terrific - great room - small enough to contain the kids but big enough for dancing. No room hire, drinks reasonably priced, food great for a party - they even decorated the room for free. Anuj was the event manager and very efficient and quick to answer questions in the booking process - Beth was the manager on the floor the night of the party and she was excellent. Kept us well informed regarding food and alcohol consumption. Projector for photos and mic for speeches thrown in and free wifi for Spotify music - great night had by all - thank you so much. We will be back
4
So the food was OK. Ate outside on the pavement and the service was quick, helpful and courteous. Happy hour made the value for money good. Went to the Magic show on the Second Floor, which started at 20:30 hours. Stayed for the first four of eight acts. These guys are learning their trade and we enjoyed the shows. The entrance was SGD10 and that's what you got for your money. Nice crowd. Good to see a venue giving new acts a chance
4
What more could you want? Blu Jaz offers nice food at sensible prices, and a live jazz band playing while you dine. Better still, the music was loud enough to be heard, but not loud enough to kill conversation.I'll definitely re-visit next time I am in Singapore
5
Went there with friends last night, the live band was great and come every 1 hour starting 10pm. Serve drinks and dinner .. book early if you want to be in the good view to the live band performance at level 1. A bit cramp but as usual for any type of bar. Good for celebration party ! I will come back again !

Visited this place on a Monday evening. This place is located across the road from Parkview Square and near to Raffles Hospital. It is about 5-7 mins' walk from bugis mrt (exit B). It has indoor as well as outdoor sitting. We choose the indoor sitting on ground floor as we tot it was pretty was warm outside but indoor was also a tad warm as the doors were left opened. The music and singing can get a bit too loud that it is difficult to hear each other talking. So, probably just chill and listen to the music.In terms of food, we ordered a platter for sharing and it came with nan and a variety of sauce which was interesting. We also ordered fish n chips, grill chicken chop, satay and 3 non alcoholic drinks for a total of around SGD85/- which was pretty reasonable.Food tasted nice though not fantastic.Overall, a good place just chill
4
The jazz bands, live music, three seating areas: up and downstairs and outside. We always sit outside then go upstairs for live music. Friends and visitors enjoyed Blu Jazz and all say they liked the food. I like the falafel platter and hummus. Sometimes it is a hit and once it was a miss. One so-so meal does not make me stay away. You can go by yourself and end up chatting with many foreigners having fun. I think it is closed on Sundays. We have eaten there at least 25 times as it is perfect after walking around its neighborhood and people-watching. You will see locals, expats, tourists, and students. Middle eastern and western food. Staff are marvelous. ALWAYS had our orders correct and wait staff friendly and good-humored
5
Organised a meeting for about 50pax recently at Level 2 of Blu Jaz. The ambience, food and service was excellent. Thumbs up to Anuj (Event Mgr) and Pawan (Flr Mgr) for their great service quality. Will definitely be back!
5
Great place, very chill. Workers here are very friendly and helpful. Items are reasonably priced as well
4
Very relaxed cool bar, but it is popular and can get busy. I've never had a warm beer here and the food is ok for a bar.
2
Came with a bunch of local friends. Apparently warm beer and fingers in glasses are tolerated here. Quiet a bad experience at this jaz bar
3
Probably I got an unwashed glass. The service was very attentive and immediately brought me a new drink. Overall we had a quite pleasant evening.
4
Was a great place to smoke shisha but this has sadly been stopped. Still a lovely place to sit relax and have a few drinks. The food is also good, especially the mid eastern food. Very friendly staff.
3
We were there in the late afternoon and it was buzzing. Sit outside to enjoy to colourful mural wall paintings and the vibe of people coming and going.Happy hour prices are pretty good - a pint of beer for S$10++, 2 glasses of house red for S$15 nett (though I didn't care too much for it).Come chill out
4
Went for dinner quite late no problems getting a table even though the restaurant was very busy. Great food very tasty and good sized portions, nice cocktails. Live singer proved pleasant entertainment during dinner, staff friendly and attentive no waiting around. All in all a great meal in a nice place would go to again without hesitation
2
I went to Blu Jaz for a drinks with friends. Some of us ordered bottle beers but unfortunately the beer was warm... I asked the waiter to change my beer but he informed me that all the bottle beers were at the same temperature (the fridge is open most of the time due to the high volume of orders)
5
Blu Jaz is an excellent place to escape the usual tourist aunts in Singapore. Situated in Kampong Glam, which is probably the most 'hip' part of the city, Blu Jaz lives up to its name in providing some excellent music, whether sitting outside or in. Drinks are reasonably priced ad food is good. Sit outside if you want to do a little people watching or admire the murals
4
Called for a drink and an evening snack. Good service and food. Great music both live and recorded will definitely go again
4
Organized Business Year End Party at Blu Jaz. Space is quite good and service is great. The free flow of alcohol arrangements is even better. Worthwhile to visit to de-stress, hang out or simply chill.
5
It's a great place to go, away from the tourist rush. All the bars and restaurants in the vicinity - Arab Street and Bali Lane - seem to somehow share a nice, unique atmosphere. Quiet enough to be able to meet someone you want to talk to but still live enough that you are most certainly not bored. Good service - they come back to ask you do you need anything more and to get you extra tap water and things like that. Affordable for Singapore and for what is a nice place to go out. Also good dinner if you're staying at one of the nearby hotels, especially as they serve food till quite late. Also good if you've just finished shopping at Bugis street as it's just a short stroll away. Food is actually quite good. I wanted to try something local so went for the hot but delicious Sambal Prawns
4
Just at the part of Bali lane off Ophir Road, this is a Jazz centric bar, with a good variety of cocktails and food. You can enjoy the outdoor seating with the surrounding walls laden with neon street art. Service is prompt in-spite of the large crowds. Food is decent, I really enjoyed the lamb "shawarma". Why i have placed shawarma within inverted commas is because the dish is actually just pita pockets stuffed with an asian style cooked lamb, however it is delicious eat. Drinks are made well. A good lively ambience overall
4
Nice place to hang out and have a drink or something to eat. It's quite affordable for Singapore. If you want to eat something, I would recommend ordering the "traditional food" as it is cheaper and a bigger serving than e.g. the size of the pasta.
4
So this is far away from the usual spots tourists would hang out. It's a simple place, indoor and outdoor seating, there's a band that we didn't really hear since we were outside. Happy hour till I think 7. They have a system where food can be ordered from other places but through their menu.A good place to chill out and watch people go by.
4
This is the second time we have private event with Blu Jaz.On March 16, 2017 we hosted a private function at Blu Jaz Level 2 for our overseas guests.The comments from our overseas guests were great: cosy and relax atmosphere, great Mediterranean buffet, beer and wine, and friendly service from Pawan (the floor in-charge), Siva (the engineer) and Anuj (the event manager).The cafe was also lent us a keyboard to our musician, and set up the karaoke for our guests to entertain themselves. All in all we have a wonderful time and beautiful memory to share
4
Went on Friday night and expected it to be really crowded, but we managed to get a table. Drinks were not really overpriced (compared to other pubs in Singapore), and the ambience was pleasant enough.There are different types of performances for different timing. So if you have any preference, you can check it ahead of time and plan for the timing to visit the place. If you're going there to enjoy the music and chill, it would be great to sit inside as the music is not loud enough to be heard outside (and speaker is not that great). If you are going there just to chill and grab some drinks, it's perfectly fine to sit outside
3
Stopped in to avoid the rain and had a few drinks. It's quite loud and does make use of some other cafes and areas around so you can find a quieter spot. Guinness was good and my lime daiquiri average with a slightly better lychee martini. All in all a little loud, a little expensive (although not by Singapore standards), but OK.
5
We were there for hours. Meal. Drinks while watching the band and then upstairs for dancing.Didn't feel Singapore-Rhian which is nice sometimes.Not cheap but food was good. I had Dory which was excellent. Pork Ribs and steak sandwich went down well too.Basically, it's as you imagine it will be from the name and in that part of town.Say it with me .. "nice....
4
As this place is close to our office we often have lunch there.
Daily changing menus and a good variety of food, also a good place for dinner or just a couple of beers
5
Blujaz is a great place to relax with a few drinks. Great food, live music with a big area to sit outside and enjoy the sun over a few cold beers. Quiet during the day but certainly livens up at night
5
The food is good, reasonable pricing and the people just so amazing! Anuj, Pawan and their team took very good care of us and always accommodating!
will definitely have another party there soon!
4
My friend choose this place for hang out. The service and food is perfect. Lovely decoration in the toilet.
Near by my office, so there will be the next visit after work.
3
this bar offers you with their al fresco atmosphere. They have a beautiful Mayan Grafitti at their wall. Too bad this bar close at 12 pm for weekdays. sometimes they have a jazz live music to lighten up the ambience.
4
The Blu Jaz Cafe has three levels and each had its own flavour of live music and vibes, even though they all shared the same food and drink menus. We were on the 3rd floor where a live band were covering rock songs, so it got a little loud to have a verbal conversation. The food was great for its price though. The non-alcoholic drinks menu was as good as their alcohol menu and portions were generous so you have enough for a night
5
We held a Christmas Party at BluJaz and it was fantastic. During the planning of the event, we have received great help from the event manager, Anuj. He is prompt in his replies with no delays and provided us with useful recommendations to the best of his ability in all aspect, from food, event layout to drinks and cater to all our request.On the day of event, BluJaz provided generous portion of food, more than sufficient to the number we catered, and people who attended the event all said the food was good. Staffs were friendly, and service was good even though they were short of staff on that day.Overall, we have an awesome and happy Christmas at Blujaz. It is definitely a recommended choice to hold a party/event.Regards,Kean
5
We reserved the entire level 3 for our company Christmas party, and everything went smoothly without a hitch! Anuj the event manager, was extremely accommodating and communicative from the start of our reservation, a month prior to the party. Service on the night was excellent - thanks to Ken, who was in charge of our floor. Food and drinks all arrived promptly, and technical difficulties with the projector were seen to right away. Everyone had the best time and it was all down to the comfortable, relaxed environment that Blu Jaz and their team offered to us. Thank you for a memorable night
5
We held our farewell party at Blu Jaz recently and the experience has been awesome. We reserved the whole of level 2 at Blu Jaz and the space was very nicely decorated. It even come with an outdoor area for the smokers. I didn't have much expectation on the food during the planning stage. But it turned out the food was one of the things that we really raved about. Planning with Anuj the even manager was almost seamless. It was easy and all had turned out well. Pawan our barman was also very friendly and attentive. We really had a great night. Thanks Blu Jaz for the great service and great food.We will definitely want to be back!
4
Arriving late in Singapore and just looking for a place to eat, drink and smoke, we came across blu jazz and were quite glad we did. A good menu and a good beer list that was not too expensive meant a great evening. Happy to come back
4
Situated on Bali Lane this place always seems to be a popular choice, lively atmosphere!
Boasting a decent food&drinks menu which certainly does the job and excellent live entertainment this establishment is well worth a visit!
5
Starting with excellent service staff, we enjoyed the cool jazz soundtrack playing and the delicious food. My husband said, "Wow!" more than once while eating his hamburger. The smoked tomato soup was different and delicious.
5
Very nice place for all kind of music, friday and saturday nigths, very good music on ground level.
Nice atmospere also
4
I had lunch at this place with my Singaporean colleagues. We ordered lunch set menu. It included very tasty soup, beef steak and coffee with small sweet. Very chip price. It was cost us for 3 people less than 50S$.
4
Nice restaurant in a lovely area. Friendly service, food is quick and very tasty. Jazzy music. We shared satay and shwarma, enough for lunch.
4
Located in Kampong Glam, this restaurant has good range of food both local and European. Particularly recommend the chicken satay, and Tiger beer
4
Love the atmosphere here, food taste was nice with reasonable prices.. Friendly Filipino staff. Recommended to have chit chat, lunch or dinner here. We took 2 set lunch with soup and Beef steak as main course only cost only 12 usd!!
4
Very warm and friendly servers. When you step in, they will ask you if we are here for drinks or dinner. Ordered a Grilled Salmon, Satay and Mee Goreng. Salmon is very well grilled, skin is crispy and veg was well done. We ordered a mix satay of chicken and lamb. The Chicken Satay was good however the lamb was abit hard for my liking. Mee Goreng was very well done according to my wife. If you like it more spicy, don't feel shy to ask for chili padi!
4
Great bar/restaurant/cafe.Very friendly and attentive staff,pleasant watching the world go by,sipping a beer or two(or a sav blanc ),at the side-walk tables.Didn't find out until we got back to Oz that happy hour continued up stairs for an extra couple of hours.Good memories of BluJaz,Singapore.Tom n Di
4
When we strolled through the Arab quarters we were looking for a place to have a nice lunch.We decided to sit in the courtyard of Blu Jaz - a little away from the street - and go for their set lunch which consisted of a soup, a main of either steak or fish, a desert and a drink. The fish one was 10 Dollars the steak one 12. It was really good. Tasty, good portions.The staff seems a bit in a hurry bringing the courses really fast and the courtyard is connected to a smaller side street so that people walk past you all the time while you're eating. But it was still a very good place to have an enjoyable meal for an ok price. We can recommend it
5
We had lunch here. The menu was diverse and interesting. The food was great. The atmosphere was very pleasant. The staff attentive and helpful. I definitely return!
3
This place not that great, was fine. Got live band, affordable price and if you're working nearby area, this quite good to relax after work. Kind of hard to get taxi tho
5
Just a quick one to say this place has great music and varied looking menu (didn't try as had already eaten elsewhere) and a nice street atmosphere. If you're in the area and like jazz - a must do.
4
Great little find when wandering around Haji and Bali Lanes, and the live music was a bonus! Cool and vibrant place!
5
Didn't eat but met for drinks here on a crazy busy Friday night. Great table service great music great atmosphere great night out in Singapore
5
1. The food here is nicely prepared 2. The staff here is super cool and remembers you on your second visit3. Comedy team management is friendly and talks with you after the show4. Drinks from the bartender are made well.5. Seating is comfortable 6. Crowd was fun with the comedians7. Comedians are great. Open mic night on Thursday was a blast.All in all this is a fun thing to attend for food, drinks and laughs
5
Good location with seating available inside and out. We chose an outside table which was pleasant as we could here the Jazz Band but could still have a conversation. Menu is varied with both western & eastern options, good quality & premises are licensed. Staff are friendly and service is prompt. Would eat here again
4
Blu Jazz is well-known for its live-music, drinks and vibe but it is also the location for comedy, spoken-word and other arts-related activities. During those nights, the place can get crowded on the second floor (if you knew they had a second floor) and spill over to the first floor at a 'sold-out' show. If you enjoy these activities, look up for Facebook or Peatix events before coming down. If you don't like a noisy vibe, avoid Blu Jazz on those days
5
We hosted our annual team offsite (~25 people) event at Blu Jaz CafÃ©. It's a great setting for a cozy informal discussion. Mr. Anuj, their event manager, helped manage all the logistics including projector, sound system, mikes, food, drinks, etc. We just visited the venue once to put in a nominal deposit. At the venue itself, Anuj was assisted by Mr Pawan as floor manager. He was most helpful throughout the day, solving technical issues in a jiffy, ensuring we had free flow of water, tea/coffee, juices, tackling our last minute requests to set meals out a bit early or a bit later... and doing all this with a smile. We had a great time. In fact, this was the 2nd time we hosted our event here and we'll definitely be back!Oh, did I mention, the food is great and it's pretty reasonable too..
4
The Blu Jaz is located in the urban district of Kampong Glam. There are many small individual boutiques, cozy cafes and bars. The atmosphere of the neighborhood makes you forget about the steel and concrete giants of the city. The narrow houses are built side by side. They usually consist of two floors. Everything around here exudes coziness, so does the Blu Jaz. Outside, you can take a seat on chunky wooden benches at thick solid wooden tables, where you most likely will have more than just one night cap. The music is loud, the atmosphere relaxed. And on top: the drinks and snacks are far from overpriced
3
Great location and music was excellent. Singapore Comedy Club was there and there were some good performances and some not so good. Staff were pleasant although beer prices were expensive.
4
Came for the food and stayed a little for the music. Everyone enjoyed the food and the service was good. We were on the second floor on the open patio. Was good until later in the evening when it became the smokers favorite spot.
3
The spaghetti cabonara was the most tasteless pasta I have ever had in my life. But it was a great place to just hang out and have some drinks. Service was average. Good atmosphere but a bit busy.,
4
A good place for a quiet lunch meeting wit variety of options and good preparation, although the veggie triangle was a bit too oily. Tortillas were awesome.
3
Blu Jaz cafe is in the "Arabic" side of town, not far from the Mosque. This area is the place to be a the moment in Singapore. This place has lots of seats outdoors so it's nice for a couple of drinks at the beginning or at the end of the night. But I would stay clear of the food as it's nothing special and Singapore has so much more to offer. Every time I see such a big and varied food menu (ranging from "local" dishes to Italian food!?) alarm bells always go off in my head.
4
Bustling with people... Blu Jaz is so lively and has a fantastic location.My Friends and I enjoyed the Cocktails and Wine. We had just starters and Salad and it was very tasty.The live music was good....too loud though....nice choice of songs..We loved the experiece...
5
This is one of the most chill places in Singapore. I recently had a farewell party for my colleague. We were very satisfied by the service of the Blue Jaz staff. They serve yummy meals and drinks. Service staff are super super friendly and efficient. Do contact Anuj for any party/celebrations and I am sure he will plan a wonderful theme party for you
4
We stumbled upon this place after a remmendation from a friend who said its tucked away, but very casual and a great place to sit back and relax for an evening, with sometimes live music, and good happy hours from 5-7pm most days.The drinks were great, plenty of options, and well priced, for Singapore. We didn't eat here, but the food looked good and didn't see anyone complaining.Two sets of toilets which is always good incase you need to go quickly, and both inside and outside seating.The service sometimes is a little lacking, trying to get someones attention to get service, but this sometimes seems a little typical in Singapore.if the service was better, i would of given this a 5 star! But i will be back, perhaps it was just a one off.Great place, worth stopping in with a large group, or couples, or friends
4
I went on the first Saturday of the month and it was the "Rewind" event of the bar. Hits from the 90s and many "old skool" songs were played! Greatly enjoyed the music and the atmosphere there. Live music was also available. Overall, a nice place to hang out to have a couple of beers with your friends
3
Bali Lane is a nice hidden away street with lots of Bars and Restaurants. Blu Jazz is clearly one of the more popular one. It was a packed Wednesday night. Food is just ok, prices are reasonable for Singapore The background Jazz music was ok. Service was so-so, not the most helpful, but it was indeed crowded
5
The burger here is pretty good, and reasonably priced. Drinks are about average price for the area.
Good music and good atmosphere for some evening drinks.
Probably 4.5 stars but feeling generous today so I'll round it up to 5
5
Terrific little place for a casual meal. Great family friendly menu and the staff were attentive and helpful. Meals served in a flash which I always like. Will be back.
3
Stopped in here after a quick tour of Bugis and a trip down Haji Lane. Cool vibe about the place, though drinks were quite expensive and nothing looked especially appealing on the menu.
4
Good option around the Arab street area and quite value for money! Liked the shish kabab, lamb chops, mousaka and the pita hummus!
4
June 2016 we went to Blu Jaz Cafe a group of about 20 ladiesWe started with drinks and snacks at the ground floor, we tried the house wine and had a couple of beers.Nachos to go with it.Next up we had lamb chops and Falafel and Baked rice as well as some fries and a few more finger foods.Soon it was time to go upstairs to the comedy show.The had an open mike evening and we took our cocktails and settled in.They had arranged theater seating.There were about 50 to 70 ppl and it was a full house almost.A couple of the comedians were so so just okay but some were a real riot. The best was an Indian guy called Rishi Mahtaniquite fun and funnyA great evening at Blu Jaz CafeMention to the staff on the ground floor very attentiv
4
This review is a bit late - but better late than never! Level 3 was a fabulous location for my husband's 40th birthday celebration. The space was perfect for the 45 people we had. Loved that we could bring our own DJ (Thank you DJ Dhash!!) and that we could party till late. The decorations were gorgeous and there was enough room to sit, stand, dance or eat. Anuj was super helpful during the planning stages and during the event itself. Very involved and communicative. The staff were really nice - I only wish they had helped to serve the cake once it was cut. Otherwise a great night for us - couldn't have done it without Anuj and his team. Highly recommended venue for your next event
4
This place had a reputation of very good jazz band. The place was packed at 8 p.m. Saturday night (yesterday). Indoor and outdoor seating were completely full. If you wish to sit inside and watching the band closely, you needed to come early. The jazz music here was excellent!!Cocktails drinks was quite weak. Mostly like a drinking mocktails. Estimate that was only half Oz of alcohol in it or even less. Order beer here and skip the cocktails. Food? I'm not risking my stomach here after reading so many reviews across websites. The service was decent though.
5
All of us are very impressed by Blu Jaz Cafe staff's professionalism, cool, friendly and efficient service rendered right from bar tender, server, Chef (Mr Mel Stewart) and F&B Manager (Mr Anuj) to ensure the foods quality are not compromised and the set up of the musical equipment etc. We know your staff's have thankless task.We enjoyed the beautiful ambiance, decorations and the foods especially the Nachos, BBQ Pork Ribs and Chicken drumstick and wings. Please extend our sincere appreciation to your staffs on-duty that evening

Wow! We just had our "Third time" celebration of our successful year end party hosted at level3, Blu Jaz with their excellent staff.Anuj, the event manager continued to display excellent organisation skills from set up to delicious menu offered and service to complete for with his fantastic team of people. In addition to that, he offered a value for money in offering a good deal worth the money. Anuj's team comprising of Ken as the floor in charge for that day, looking into catering, drinks and house keeping along with Terry. Both men made sure all fifty guests in the room were well taken care of with their warm hospitality and excellent service.In the last, we have had the same experience at "Piedra Negra" with Anuj as a remarkable event manager along with his team member,Pawan, floor in charge foR that day, continued to serve our group of forty adults with his warm smile.Along with that, our staff have had similar experience at Blu Jaz level 1, cafe, with Maan, another fantastic staff member with his equally superb colleagues who do not fail to deliver their smile along with out order of food and drinks.Well you must be still wondering, what is so great about this place ? The truth is that till today, my guests and I still remember the memorable three year experiences at Blu Jaz for the events we have been to here, along with the casual dinner drinks on weekends with our families and friends.We look forward to be served by warm and welcoming staff working at Blu Jaz, Piedra Negra and Museum cafe along with the outstanding event manger, Anuj, and his wonderful hard working team.Cheers

I went to Blu Jaz recently as neighbouring Piedra negra was too busy. Sadly, the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. We were seated outside with our drinks but wanted to watch the band perform so we took our drinks in. Within seconds, the waitress chased us inside with a bill. We proceeded to head back outside but our coasters were gone. We asked again for them and carried on drinking sitting side by side. Moments later, an elderly waiter came and asked us to move opposite each other to make room for others. I said no I want to sit here and to my surprise he said "Hey! We have a business to run here!" We was so disturbed that we finished up our drinks and walked to another section. I decided to ask for the manager to give him feedback about the poor service. He simply nodded and walked away!? No action taken. This place sucks so don't bother coming and don't waste your time unless you are fine with being treated poorly

Nice pub with live music.
Arab street has many Jae locations and this is one if it. Beer is comparably cheap and food is good.
5
Visit during the day and you will enjoy a laid back atmosphere, drinks and lunches are served.
Sit outside and you could be in the Paris or London bohemian scene.
Then at night it comes alive with great live music.
Great watering hole.

A perfect place to relax, have a drink and listen to some funky jazz after a busy day @ Orchard.
The coronas were nice and cold and the calamari tastefull and crisp.
This is a different Singapore, enjoy!!
5
Organised a dinner there with a group of friends, which was followed by a stand-up comedy show, as part of the M1 Fringe Festival preview, on the third floor. The staff were very helpful and the service was excellent. Mr Pawan served us throughout with lots of patience and a smile across his face. Event manager Mr Anuj was sincere and handled all my requests very well. We had a fantastic time last nite enjoying the dinner and comedy show.
5
Our Party was handled by Anuj the Event Manager who was very confident on delivery of all that was promised for the party on 15 Apr & YES, he delivered! My colleagues were very happy with the choice made for our party! I must say food was really good and drinks selection was great as everything was available as we were privileged to have Pawan as a Floor Incharge, who served us endlessly.Great job guys & definitely we will be back for more corporate parties with you, highly recommended for anyone looking for a funky cool pub with good food and set up! Thank you Anuj

We went here for a quick drink in the evening on New Year's eve to get in our obligatory Singapore Sling during our stay. The band was setting up when we got there, so there is live music, the atmosphere seems perfect for Jazz. Service was very good, and the cocktail was excellent! I can definitely recommend Blu Jaz for a drink
4
I first went here for the Chroam Party and i never go back. They don't have that anymore but they still have some RnB nights. Thay also have some jazz nights. I love the hummus and the baba ghanosh here. The lasagna is very tasty as well
5
I couldn't have been happier with the service Anuj and his team provided for my husbands birthday party. It was a truly memorable night, they did a great job with all the decorations and nothing was too much trouble! All our friends had the best time. The ambience was perfect and so was the music! Would highly recommend Blu jaz! Thank you everyone at Blu Jaz :)
5
I chose the 3rd floor of Blu Jaz cafe to host the project closeout event for my clients and company. Everyone who attended was pleased with the selection of food, drinks and sound system. Best of all, the seating was lounge style, with couches and chairs around the floor making it an ideal setting for relaxing and networking. The belly dancers were of course a plus! Events manager Anuj was very welcoming and helpful with customized menus and support. am looking forward to hosting another event there sometime in the near future
5
This is a shic night spot with everything on offer. Amazing live music and excellent tapas food and the experience of Shisha. It has a funky appearance with loads of atmosphere. I have been several times with friends and I would highly recommend you take the time to visit this wonderful night spot
4
Nice terrasse and quiet atmosphere.
Food is ok and service is pretty good.
The proces are ok for singapore
3
We stopped by for a quick drink and enjoyed the break. Our drinks were good and served quite quickly, however the staff seemed rather disinterested.
4
This quaint bar offers good finger food to nibble on as you people watch whilst enjoying, I think, the Best, freshly made Singapore Sling in town. No premix to be be seen. Try it for yourself Yih won't be disappointed.
4
Good atmosphere and a lot of menus to choose, also have chicha and belly show but you've to be there pretty early because it will be fully booked
5
We went to Blujaz cafe last Friday,22/01/20167 pax of my WIP guests,we tried your all dips, hummus, avocado, baba ghanoush...pita breads,chicken kebab, beef kebab,shawarma, and lamb chop, grilled Salmon fish,all foods was fantastic. we all really enjoyed the foods and the atmosphere,they're such a great foods,and place,we will sure want to visit your place again:)see you real soon,thanks all of yours well done..
5
I enjoyed a few meals in the terrace of this restaurant. Although it's in a quite traffic busy street, the terrace is nice with shade. There is a lot of variety of food in the menu and the prices are very reasonable. It's a big restaurant with very nice atmosphere.There are no major attractions in the area of the restaurant but there are quite a lot of pubs/restaurants around it

I did a corporate training dinner at Blu Jaz last year and was amazed at the value I got for my spend. Great food , lovely ambience of a private floor and excellent service by Anuj and Pawan made the event very successful.Its a lovely place to relax post work . I repeated another event here this year and had a very pleasant experience again. Highly recommended for a relaxing evening .Thanks to Anuj and Pawan again for looking after the group so well
1
I went to this restaurant last night (19.01.2016) and we were a group of 14 persons. Our dinner orders included Kofta, Sheesh Kebab, Baba Ghanoush, etc. Every single one of us was incredibly disappointed by your restaurant. The quality of the food awful; the service was questionable but the food was appalling. The Koftas were all burnt (all 6 or 7 of them) and incredibly dry. The provided sauce was just gooey and unnecessarily spicy. The Baba Ghanoush had no flavour... The only thing that tasted good was the pita (which I don't think you even make homemade). The service was slow and not very communicative. One person's dish did not come until 30 minutes after everyone else... after chasing 3 times for it! I can honestly say that none of us will be coming back if things don't improve
5
We recently had a birthday party at Blu Jazz for our daughter who turned 18. The restaurant manager Anuj was extremely helpful and sensible with ordering suggestions as well as providing wonderful support throughout the evening. The restaurant was specially decorated with lovely balloons and the staff tried their best to make the evening a success which it was!Thank you to the staff and especially Anu
1
My partner and I were looking forward to some Turkish dips and falafel. Boy were we disappointed. The falafel was like hard, dry golf balls, the hummus was unbearably salty and the service was non-existent.Avoid this place if you want good food. Try Arab street instead. Probably 100 times more authentic!!
4
Had an very enjoyable night out here ! Nice place good drinks quick service and good music. Food looked ok -we didn't have any as we are elsewhere-
Certainly worth a try
4
The best place to chill out.
For less than S $1, 300 for 21 pax, we get signature foods, beer, juice and good venue for jamming.
4
Found this by accident, huge menu choices, great food, cold, cold beer and super cheap...definitely worth a visit
4
Great atmosphere at night, great finger food. One of the best places in SG to hang out with friends and enjoy a beer. Make sure you order the pita breads with all the different dips.
4
BluJaz (yes, some letters are missing!) is a great place for fun, relaxed, efficient and smiling service. Actually much more 'genuine' and as such, better than Clark Quay to go out.Your taxi will drop you a few yards away, as this is a pedestrian-only steet (good)Close to Arab Street, apparently worth visiting as well (did not)Finger food is tasty. Better do a booking, as the place gets packed at night
4
Blu Jaz, which was close to the Village Bagis Hotel where I was staying, was a real find. Good music, decent food in a variety of styles, and good cocktails, again at reasonable prices. Both nights I got into interesting conversations with people...it has a large outdoor space and quick service
4
Nice place! Service is very nice. Shisha are good and they change charcoals regularly. They have a good menu if you want to eat or drink something, Sitting outside is very nice as it takes you out of the very clean Singapore for the time you stay there. Walls are great, very colorful. They also broadcast sports on the wall which is very well done
5
Bluz Jaz is a really lively place, we love the food, live bands that play there, drinks and the sheesha.We often visit there on weekends to chill and enjoy.Colorful wall art makes it appear so quirky and colorful.And yes, service is great too
5
Firstly, I would like to give a huge shout out to the Operations Manager, Anuj. He has catered to every single demand for our corporate event.We were being greeted with such a friendly and up beat team! Throughout the entire event, we were being served with such an unforgettable service.The food here is great! Blu Jaz made sure there were labels for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Everyone enjoyed every single bite!The ambience is awesome! The decorations have been catered to just the way we liked. :):)Oh, and if any of you are worried about music during your corporate event, Blu Jaz has a DJ who has superb playlist and is also willing to take in requests!Thank you Blu Jaz for such a wonderful experience! Double Thumbs up & to many more events at Blu Jaz! :):):):

Since my first visit to Singapore, Blue Jas has always been one of my favorite places thanks to its great ambience, good food, good drinks and attentive staff.
5
Located a short walk from Bugis MTR station, we came across this place only because it was known by a local friend who we were meeting.
Excellent menu choice and great cocktails.
A really nice relaxed evening just chatting, eating and drinking
4
For a quick bite or a filling lunch, Blu Jaz provides value for money. The staff are friendly and the lunch time service is fast and professional.
5
Good food, reasonably priced, best Singapore sling in Singapore. Lovely music. Staff were attentive. Worth a visit!
5
Me and my husband came to this bar a couple of time as it was so close to our hotel. Such a relaxed atmosphere and seemed like a very popular bar as it was quite busy. Lovely sat outside smoking Shisha and drinking with some local people. Everyone is so friendly
4
Just this weekend I met with friends at Blue Jaz. We were luck to get a table as the place was full. Service in Singapore is not too great, so don't expect much and if I could rank just the service, I'd give it 2.5 - 3*The music though is fantastic and worth going for at any time. Drinks and food are average (expensive) Singapore prices and they only have a small selection of vegetarian food options.
5
Excellent venue for a casual night out.Good background music and a buzzy atmosphere and some nights live bands.the service staff are very friendly and efficient even when the place is packed.It is a good idea to book a table if you are going with a group,you can do this on their website.There is a good variety of drinks and cocktails and a menu with a good mix of dishes.There are seats both inside and along the pavement and a side section which is the smoking area.The outside seating is great for watching the world go by.The food arrived promtly but it was a bit hit & miss,the falafal was very crunchy and dry inside,the chicken was also dry,but the duck salad and the spicy wings were very good.Overall it is a good place to go for a night out.My husband also went there for lunch and he said it was very good
3
Came here for dinner and drinks, and left slightly underwhelmed. The atmosphere of the place was OK, but the service, as some other reviewers have rightly pointed out, is quite shocking. We weren't so much ignored as overlooked, and one waitress in particular, had something of an attitude problem. We ended up helping ourselves to the water after waiting 20 minutes.The food was delicious, but the serving sizes were very small! We ordered the lamb chops and lamb schwarma, and dessert afterwards. I still needed a snack when I got home.I ordered a pear cider, which went down well in the Singapore heat, but my mom's house red was not great. I tend to judge bars according to the standard of their house pours, so this one was definitely only a 4/10.I think if I'd stumbled upon this place by accident as opposed to being told about it, perhaps I wouldn't have been quite so disappointed
5
We had done one of our company's workshop over at Blu Jaz, the staffs (Anuj & Pawan) had made things really easy for us. Everything was well taken care of! They are always full of smiles answering all our queries and needs. Price was really reasonable and food was good. What matters everyone was happy throughout the workshop! Thank you once again Anuj & Pawan for the awesome service!!ZaraSingapor

If you want a casual place with some great live jazz music then head to Blu JAzz in SIngapore. The music is amazing they get some amazing performers and some time the surprise JAzz with visiting musician in the audience add the fun. The place has a very casual feel to it. It has seating inside and also outside along the road and in a cooler nights it's great to sit outside and see the world or I should say traffic pass by! The food is good and not expensive and the music not loud and what else do you need for a great weekend! Highly recommended
4
the burger is delicious!! great for matching with beer. live band only played some days of the week. the staff are friendly.
3
Visited with my friends on a Monday evening.. Still a busy place at night.. Good open place for beer and chat.. Watch the games replayed on their big wall screen
1
It used to be OK mid eastern food. We just went there tonight with friends and the food was terrible from pitas to humus to the shawarma. Very disappointing experience... So sad!
5
My friends took me here for lunch as they'd been here before and raved about it. I can now see why they loved it. You don't even feel like you're in Singapore. The food and service was great. I look forward to going back again.
2
Everything is in the title. The place is cool, the food is good, but in terms of customer management there is a huuuuuge area of improvement.Apart from the never-smiling staff, do not expect any kind of customer relationship or friendliness there. They are running a business. You will never have any kind of arrangements even if you are a regular customer. You will pay the extra crackers for your cheese: 4sgd the 7 crackers, you can negotiate 2sgd for 4 crackers and if you really start to complain you can have the crackers for free. (just for information a box of crackers is 2sgd)This is quite a frustrated review, written after several bad experiences there. Whether it is amongst my friend or my company, we have decided to avoid this place for now on
5
Love it. The ambience, food and beer are all we wanted after a busy Singapore day. We were fortunate to see the amazing Justin Liew play live twice when we stayed nearby in early Feb. The busy main road is shielded by plants, but we found filtering it out easy. Staff are lovely. Have been going back every time we visit Singapore since it opened about 9 years ago. Not all the food is traditional Asian - its just very, very good
3
If you're in a group and are sharing bites, get the fries over the calamari rings because the portion size for the fries is substantial and a LOT cheaper. The calamari was about $8 or $9 for a few pieces, as opposed to a basket of fries for around $6-7. Also, the hummus is DELICIOUS and is a must-try. Go inside for a more lively experience - they have comedians and live bands playing on different nights. Outside or in the alley is a great alfresco place to hang.Service, honestly, was a bit slow and staff appeared sour and grumpy all night. It was understandable - it was Friday night after all - but when we asked for our order to be taken and was ignored for 15 minutes - not a pleasant experience. You just have to bear in mind that Blu Jaz is SO crowded on Friday nights and if you prefer more attentive service, head there on a weeknight
3
A nice place to hang out and relax with a few pints of beer. Food could be better though. We ordered prawn mango salad, chicken satay and grilled fish. They were all lacking in taste and freshness of ingredients can be improved. Service was alright but not impressive.We didn't manage to see the live band but will come back next time
4
we were wandering around trying to find somewhere that had a bit of everything - and Blu Jaz didn't disappoint. Great mix of Arab, Malay and Western Food. They had something to satisfy everyone in our group. Service was good and the price was reasonable (by Australian standards)
4
We were about to end our trip of singapore when we decided to have a late night out . First walked around arab street but later stumbled onto this place not to far . Very lively place with live music and bustling surroundings . Very hard to get tables on weekends we waited an hour but it was worth it . Ordered cocktails around the world , long beach island , moussaka and kebabs and baked chicken rice for final meal . We had a good time and may be a bit pricy if u haven't eaten in Singapore before but actually reasonable really . Many places to choose from . But this place had music and beer pitchers so great . Also lots of cocktails for the ladies 20+ !
5
Our family really enjoyed eating here during our holiday. It was lovely to sit outside and the menu was quite extensive. Service was efficient.
4
Good ambience. Brilliant place for a nice evening with friends. Plus 1 for the ambience. Don't expect much from the food especially if your a vegetarian. Will be surely visiting again
4
This is one of the few places in SIngapore in a prime location yet with affordable prices. The food is great, very tasty, and has a mix of Greek/Lebanese/Western styles. It is a great feeling to be able to enjoy a cold one right in the heart of Arab Street action. Definitely the place to start your evening. It is also nice for lunch on the terrace
3
We had moussaka hoping to get a rest from the usual local spicy stuff. Horrors! It was doused in chili. Completely spoiled the food which had no taste apart from the chili. The atmosphere is pleasant although the location is a little too close to a very busy road. I will probably go back but will not pick the Moussaka
3
I have been here many times with my eldest son but only for drinks, either in the alleyway or at the pavement tables alongside the road.It's a fun place, especially after an alcohol free meal in Arab Street with a good selection of beers and mojitos at $14 Sing each
5
I love it here for their music and food. They served varies of food and cocktails. Jazz music is played every night by awesome great musicians. I love the atmosphere at Bali Lane. The food here is of really good deal and taste and at affordable price tag too.
1
Nice atmosphere, but what a terrible terrible service!!! Of my entire life, I've never encountered bartenders with such obnoxious attitude. They were rude and I made to feel like a beggar asking for their drink even if I had the money to pay in full amount. 10% service charge was added to every bill, even though there was no service at all. We had to find our own free table, go to the counter, and "beg" them to sell us drink
5
If you like Greek food and fresh quality ingredients then this is simply one of the best restaurants in Singapore. The roasted Halloumi Cheese starter is exceptional, and everything seems to be made fresh on the spot. I have been to this restaurant on several occasions now and I'm working my way through the menu. The service is always very good, even though the Restaurant is spread over 3 floors and there is always a complimentary liquor at the end of the meal. The wine is reasonably priced too. Be warned if you want to go on the weekend in particular a Friday or Saturday then advanced booking is required
4
The place is a real gem in Singapore. They have tables outside the restaurant, in the sidewalk and in an alley. They also project images against the building wall (I saw a soccer game, but I imagine that it could be very artistic and creative in non-soccer nights). I saw that there is a stage, but they didn't have live music when I went, so they must have some music program. The food is very good and well seasoned. I recommend the moussaka. The village salad is also good. Prices are quite reasonable. Certainly will be back
4
Great for a weekday night chill out with friends. My friend had also told me about a jazz band but we didn't find them there. After all, it was a Monday night. But the place was still packed. I love the ambiance, and we got a table on Bali Lane, just outside the restaurant. Cool music, fair prices, and great ambiance.Service was great, the staff was quite friendly and efficient. Location is great, quite central and accessible
4
Went with a friend for drinks and dinner and really liked the place. It has a nice atmosphere and young crowd. The drinks (read beer!) are good without burning a hole in the pocket. Would love to go back the next time I visit Singapore!
5
went twice for mango lassie and cacik. good place. good atmosphere specially out. perfect for spending 45 minutes and munching potato wedges. if you close your eyes you feel like you are in turkey..
4
Lovely spot for a drink and a relax after shopping in Singapore. Quirky and singular, loved the hidden icons.
4
A buzzy place with a great atmosphere,good for dinner or lunch.Some evenings there is live music giving a really laid back relaxing atmosphere .The food is above average and not badly priced.I can recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore.
3
The place had great reviews so we planned to go, the service was good and the ambience was simple awesome, buzzing with people, however at the end the food was well below average, which was a big let down to an otherwise great evening.
3
We visited the Blue Jaz and the food and service was just great with an international menu and nice location close to Arab st and Raffles. Prices were fair.
4
This is a funky bar/restaurant. I went in the afternoon and it was not crowded. The food was the best I had on my Singapore trip. The service was good. The location is interesting and relaxing. Highly recommended.
4
We went there last Saturday to listen to the Jazz performance. Even though it was a Jam night, the quality was pretty good and so were the cocktails. The service was also efficient and the atmosphere was smooth and soulful, which is often lacking in the ultra-modern buildings of Singapore. Jazz was done by around midnight, which was unfortunate. Upstairs the club was billed as R&B and classic hip hop for more mature people, but it was more of a teeny bopper crowd. Nevertheless it was OK. The surrounding area of Arab street is worth walking around, taking in the architecture and sampling some of the middle eastern food. Overall it was pretty good
4
Blu Jaz is a Singapore institution, which is why this place is usually packed. I think they only play jazz once or twice a week, but live music was on most of the time I visited the place. They actually have 3 levels: ground, with outdoor or indoor seating, second floor for cheesy hiphop music and top floor for live events such as special musical guests or comedy nights. Food here is so-so. If you must eat here, choose local Singapore specialties as everything else is way overpriced. Better you eat somewhere next door and just come here for drinks
2
It was pretty busy so ill give them that. However the service was poor. I sat for a while ready to order and no one came even though i could see staff standing around up front. So i got up and went to them. Then the brought me the wrong meal and when i asked the waiteress about it she said it was the mousaka when it clearly wasnt so i took it up to another waiter and eventually it was sorted and i got my mousaka which was nice but i was expecting something better as id heard good things about this cafe. And i was still hungry afterwards. So not very good value for money. When i went up to pay the waiter was also a bit short with me. Would not reccomend
3
The review title says it all. I had to ask for everything...to be seated, menu, drink, food order, bill. My server came in the form of whomever I was able to flag down. I will say that the food was good and fairly priced.
4
Nice to place hangout with friends after a hectic day. good food options to choose from continental & oriental dishes. located in city centre so well connected with metro & cabs. Staff is friendly n helpful.
4
Went for some drinks and sheesha - laid back place with a good crowd. Not too expensive either and the snacks were tasty.
4
I so impress with their food on my lunch "Dory Fish Grilled" is such delicious . Is very simple and worth in what u pay . I will coming back this bar before I fly back home :)
3
Blu Jaz is a small pub near arab street. Its a quite place to have a beer and relax after a long days sight seeing. The drink and snacks menu is quite alright and not too expensive.
5
Wow. Loved the whole experience. We sat outside under the fans with the colorful mural on the opposite wall. The sweet sounds of jazz flowed from the restaurante as we chatted and shared finger food of pita breads with dips, calamari rings, mini kebab sticks and later a shisha. Great service and reasonably priced.
4
Here is a decent restaurant for middle east food in arab street. When we were there they did not have any music but the food was good and the service fast !!!!! The price not so cheap and not so expansive we paid $250 for 6 people with some drinks
4
We went there for drinks on a Wednesday evening. It was busy it we had to wait for a table for about 15 minutes. Drinks were good and not too expensive taken into consideration that alcohol is expenisve in Singapore. The crowd seems to be mix of expats and tourists
4
My husband and I live in Singapore and we are used to go to this place. This nice to have a drink with friends also. It's well located, close to Arab St. You can order shisha. Dishes are nice and not so expensive.Frequently, you can enjoy jazz music having some drinks. That's definitely a good place to party
3
I've eaten here twice now, mostly because it is close to where i stay. The food is mostly aimed at an international audience. I was not too impressed, mostly because of the lack of vegetarian options. What i ate (falafel & "mozarella" cheese sticks) was ok, but not great. Service is pretty quick for a packed place.
1
I ate here last night. Ordered satay sticks. Woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. Not happy.
4
The nice outdoor area and friendly staff give this place a relaxing atmosphere. The long selection of beers at a reasonable prices make Blu Jaz a stand-out place for a casual drink in Singapore.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the ambience of the area which was very close to the bugis area with all the diverse nationalities dining together
4
Nice atmosphere all around... Food is not great though... We have had better in Singapore!
Good music and friendly staff
4
Great snacks, hummus was great with the pita. Service was good. Beer was reasonably priced. Great crowd.
5
my last visit to Singapore is exceptionally great because of Blu Jaz....couple of months ago it was a rainy day and i am with friends sitting on a roadside table.the Indian staff service its really appreciable (anuj) he help us to decide with the food and drinks . i enjoyed the beef kebab and its was extremely great...the serving staff is freindly there..and i would really like to experience the service of blu jaz again, specialy want to see that staff(anuj) again
3
It's a nice place, chilled atmosphere, haven't really eaten here apart from some pitta and humos. The drinks here are good, great apple juice and that seems hard to come by here in Singapore, I have a picky 4 year old. The mojito I ordered was nice, very strong which I guess is a good thing. The menu looks great and I've heard great things about this place so I'm assuming the food is good. Abit pricey though, 2 apple juices, 2 cocktails, pitta and humos and 2 ice creams for $83! Maybe that's normal but I've been places and ate and drunk more for that price. I suppose it'd be good to check it out in the evening and I definitely intend too. Also the shisha is pretty good too, I've been to other places around Arab street and haji lane and the shisha has been abit of a fail, so was relieved to try the proper stuff especially as this was my first proper time. Definitely a must visit if you find yourself in that neck of the wood
4
They had live music (fusion jazz) when we visited the place. We had a lot of food, liquors and beers with a reasonable cheque.They had several floors opened for the guests. The second floor could be used for private party and has their own bar. The owner and staffs were very friendly and helpful
4
Arrived in Singapore late on a Saturday night and made a beeline for the Blu Jaz CafÃ©. Great start to our short visit to Singapore as it was buzzing and we loved just sitting with our drinks and a snack people-watching. The area is lovely to walk about - Bali Lane and Arab Street - all buzzing on a Saturday night
4
Blue Jaz is a great place to have a few drinks with friends. It can get very busy at times, so it is a good idea to reserve a table if you're going out with a few friends. The food is pretty good- we've tried various dishes and they have all been tasty. They play a lot of live music and you can get a shisha there too
5
On my way to a different location I passed at Blu Jaz and couldn't help staying there for the rest of the evening. Great band playing with only short breaks. Tried hummus which was gut. Service is fast and very friendly.
4
Went there so many times, close to downtown therefore super convenient for working people; expats and locals enjoy drinks, music, sometimes belly dancing, etc ... worth to try, worth to go again !
4
A nice laid back easy going evening spot for a drink and a bite. Nice mix of people there, helpful staff and good atmosphere.
4
It's always full of people and the vibes in the place are excellent. The food is good, the location is excellent, the music always flows, what a feel good place for a pick me up night!
5
Doesnt look like much, but looks can be deseptive. Food was fantastic, I had chicken curry and it was really tasty, hubby had beef in a black pepper sauce and said it was delicous. Can definately recommend.
1
Unfortunately the concept of blu jazz has changed. Food is still excellent, but the size of the plates are now very very small. Was there almost every friday and always happy. Maybe they try to save money with this new concept, but I definitly won't come back as this is just ridiculous

Weve been going here every year on our vacation for the last 8 years, taken friends and family and had about 60 meals there. This time it was disappointing. The seafood pasta dish had hardly any seafood and the pasta was tasteless and half the portion that we had last year. My chicken curry had 2 pieces of chicken, 1 piece of potato and 1/2 a bowl of sauce. Shame on you guys! We have raved about this place for years, this had become our absolute favourite small local restaurant. Would I go back? probably not

Stopped here for drinks on a Thursday night- awesome atmosphere. Great to just sit back and people watch/mingle. Big screen alfresco TV in the courtyard, shishka scented pipes to smoke, music. Didn't eat here but food at nearby tables looked and smelt divine. Great vibe on our stopover visit

Waiter took our order; a minute later his colleague came to repeat it to check - but it was indeed incorrect. We ordered bottles of water which they didn't even open and pour. Ok you might say - but in my view, not when you're paying nearly $5 for 250ml. Food arrived after a long while, and both meals - lamb shwarma and chicken kebab - were over cooked. $40 for 1 sandwich and 1 water each at a standard cafe is not good value. I've been here in the evening when the crowd and music get going; the service has been better, and they're quick off the mark with hot shwarmas then, but today's experience was really poor

The place has buzz, if you sit al fresco it's has enough set back from the road with a luscious green hedge in between to be able to totally miss out a very busy road, with a big banyan tree providing the cover. It's a brightly painted heritage building with tables on every nook & corner including the sidewalk outside with enough space however in between for pedestrians to walk thru without bothering the patrons. Surprisingly despite all of this the acoustics were pretty good even if you are sitting outside and they have a decent band belting out popular cover versions. There were a great variety of cocktails and the drinks were very well mixed. Food was good we tried a mix of middle eastern & Italian. Service was ok but then it was a very busy place. There was Belly dancing act as well, which was very average though they billed it to be as a high point with a named belly dancer...Prices were very competitive with a lot of other very average places around.Overall great, lot happening, It's certainly a place where one can go more than once..

Nice place to have some drinks and to eat. We tried steaks- were tender and juicy, try zing wing very tasty.

Put it on your to do list once you get in the arab district

A decent place for drinks, food and atmosphere. Menus has good variety and a very comfortable place to dine and socialise with friends or make new friends. On the edge of Arab Street and the bars along here have the tendency to solicit customers but Blue Jaz didn't which made it comfortable and appealing. Reasonable prices and a good find I think.

Blu Jaz is a place where you can really enjoy yourself. Great food (middle east) & great drinks - a lot to choose from. You can sit inside and outside. The best part of Blu Jaz is live music. Can you imagine having a great time with your friends and getting all the ingredients from Blu Jaz to fulfill. Been there twice and we go there more often. I promise !

This bar has a great atmosphere and has a really nice mix of cliental. Local business men, holiday goers and groups of friends catching up for the latest gossip. With a decent amount of outdoor seating, table service and the option of shisha for those that enjoy this make this a great place to pop and have a beer or 3

I like this place so much to the point that I always bring guests there whenever they are in Singapore for a quick visit.The food is great and very affordable - I would especially recommend the black pepper beef to people who love to eat meat.The atmosphere though is what makes this place more special than the rest - to see is to believe! I will visit again soo

This is a good place for casual food outdoors. The menu is fairly wide ranging from burgers and curry to salads and dips but the long island ice tea made it for me (perfectly mixed drink to enjoy along the busy thoroughfare) even though it was 15 singapore dollars( a bit pricey in my view for this kind of establishment). The food really is very average but along with Singapore standards decent quality produce and not grisly meat for example as you may find in its UK equivalent... They also have live music here if you dont mind non-AC premises in the hot city temperatures.

The drinks were strong but delicious- some of the best quality I'd had in a very long time. GET THE MOONWALK. The food was impeccable! Chicken schwarma, spinach feta dip, amazing.The music was great, the service was good. The atmosphere outside was beautiful like you were in this magic garden, very laid back, smoke some huka if you choose. Its off Haji Lane which is a cute little boutique area. We were let down by some other places- like this spanish bar up the street (worst margarita & most expensive margarita of my life)... and kept coming back- always ended up ordering food because it was so good.I miss it already

We are staying at the Parkroyal on Beach Rd, so Blu Jaz is really close (a few minutes, walking distance). I've walked past it a few times on my way to Bugis Junction and MRT and it's the only place along Bali Lane (running parellel with Ophir Rd) that has truly interested me.We went there tonight, a Saturday night, around 8pm and they accommodated us quickly and effortlessly without a booking. They have both western and local choices on their menu. I had the Beef Sheesh Kebab and got some pita bread to go with it (a good decision). The combination of the beautifully cooked beef, vegetables, mango yoghurt and pita was simply to die for. Stunning combinations of flavour IMHO. Hubby had the lamb chops and was similarly impressed (he would normally try the local cuisine, but was recovering from a bad experience elsewhere the day before). The whole meal cost us $SGD 94, but that included a number of coctails, wine, GST & service charge. You could do it much cheaper with just the meal and soft drinks, if budget an issue.We loved the ambience and the atmosphere. The combination of the crowd, the coolng fans and the music made it easy to ignore you were sitting out on busy Ophir Rd, even when facing it. Was a lovely night, temperature-wise, so this also helped.The service was lovely when you got it, but was occasionally a bit of an effort. We were right next to the cashier and in a way this didn't help things. It wasn't a big deal, though, as soon as you got the attention of a passing waiter, you were well looked after. And the atmosphere really helped - it was so nice, we really didn't care that we had to use a bit more effort to get attention.A great night - we will return (next time to try local cuisine on the menu) and highly recommended to anyone else

Before heading down, I called them to ask who was playing. The receptionist on the phone had absolutely no idea and just said "I dont know". For a cafe that prides itself on its music, ambience and "showing you a good time", this ignorance was stunning for a receptionist who's the public face of the cafe (on the phone). I made a few more inquiries and was later transferred to someone else who seemed to know what she was talking about. I later called to make a reservation for three, reached the same man who was oblivious of his musicians earlier, and was told rudely "we're full, no reservation". I had a few other questions and got the same rude answers, with absolutely no politeness or intent to help. Right then I decided to take my money and business elsewhere. I'm giving them a 1 overall rating for pathetic, rude, elitist customer service, and nothing for ambience, F&B and value as I never went there. Their website seems to be describing some other friendly cafe in a parallel universe

Nice little place at the edge of Arab town. Bohemian atmosphere. Bar/cafe. One of the few places serving alcohol in the neighborhood. Decent food for such a place. Jamming sessions on certain nights. Nice outdoor area. Upstairs somewhat eclectic..Great for Happy Hour sessions.

Hit this place late on a Friday night and you'll be in heaven. Consistently superb servings of sublime jazz with a comprehensive drinks and cocktail list, happy wait staff, with decadent atmosphere and furnishings. Long live BJC!

OK for casual drinks if you're in the area. The only place that serves alcohol around Arab Street.

Mee Goreng is pretty good for 6 bucks - the draught beer could be better though and the service is a bit hit and miss - monday night Jazz well worth it.

Great for cheap and good fish & chips. But the band... Not my thing.

Great chill out place after work

Soulful Place to chill out...

Nice ambience. They've got live sets playing through the weekend evenings. Quirky decor makes for an arty conversation evening. Affordable menu, and quite yummy too. Value for money indeed!

'Devil-may-care' jumps to mind the moment one steps into Blu Jaz. Indoors, you will find an assorted mix of whimsical decorative fixtures and furniture. Love the guest band nights.. you won't want to leave. Outdoors, it is best described as a purposefully absent-minded clutter of wooden low/high tables, benches, chairs and unrestrained plants. Chill al fresco if you don't mind the hard seating and oftentimes secondhand smoke. You can head on upstairs for lingering drinks after your meal. Food variety adequate, quality good. Would recommend to go for the dory fish.. while a typical dish, the one served here is definitely one of the better ones around, fresh and tender. Pricing: Mid-range, lower end; very value-for-money. Service: welcoming, affable. Categorically for a lazy night out with friends
