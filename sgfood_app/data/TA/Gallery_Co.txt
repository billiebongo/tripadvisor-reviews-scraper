Nice and quiet corner of National Gallery. Perfect to grab a coffee and snacks in between viewing the artworks!
3
Convenient place to grab coffee and sweets (there are salads and hot meals too) when appreciating artwork within the National Gallery Singapore. A bit pricey compared to other cafes, though.
4
Nice place to stop and have a coffee and dessert. The mains are also delicious and they have some interesting choices!
4
Nice place to grab a coffee and nibbles if you are in the area. Would definitely come back. Good to use the Amex Platinum card here for discount on the mains.

Stingy servings, paltry service, untidy upkeep- a let down for an.upmarket Cafe. Quite a disappointment
4
When in the area I enjoy coming here for lunch. The coffee is great and the mains are worth it with their current Amex Platinum offer. Always a satisfying experience
4
The coffee here was nice and they have some delicious desserts as well. Would definitely be back if in the area.

Super bad counter service. Staff are Super rude with really bad attitude. Why charge GST when it's self collection? And Reservations through chope don't work! Don't bother!

One of my favourites for lunch. Great tasting food and reasonably priced. This place has made me a regular!

First and foremost the food isn’t actually that bad. We had the otah tacos which were a nice refreshing idea given it’s a fusion of Asian and Mexican and complemented nicely with pomegranate and sweetcorn to give it pleasant mix of crunch and sweetness. The salmon was well done and tasty as it was soft and cooked through properly so the flavour was delicate but tasty. The mushroom pasta was great as it was topped with a poached egg that gave the creamy sauce an added delicious flavour when broken over the noodles. Unfortunately the overall experience wasn’t as great as the food as the service was a little immature and poorly run for the price charged. Firstly when we went to pick up one dish the other dish was plainly in sight but we were told to come back when the buzzer was triggered, only to come back and pick up the same dish. Asking for cutlery was also not as easy as it should have been as the staff told us certain items of cutlery were finished before checking, while the items we asked for were brought out moments after by other members of staff. If these issues can be rectified, this can be a fine cafeteria befitting the national gallery of Singapore, but until it is run professionally it will not fulfil its potential
3
The food and ambience is great not as noisy as the other eateries. Great for family with kids and a group of friends outing. Abit hot if you sit near the window.
4
Brought a friend here to take advantage of Amex Platinum 50%. A nice affordable lunch if you are in the area.
4
Love the ambience and look of the cafe. The staff were also very friendly and attentive to our requests. Will definitely return for lunch again!
4
I tried the Soy Ginger salmon and it was fantastic! Very tasty & fresh. Will come back and try it again!
3
We had the salmon and pork mixed grains. The salmon was decent, came with an eggplant salad which I wish there were more of. Mixed grains were good as well.
4
The food was good and place was nice. With a pop up menu that match the theme of the exhibition is pretty and delicious

I certainly did not expect this inside the National Gallery building. The floors were dirty, tables sticky, lamps covered in dust... When I attempted to pick up a tray for the food it was dirty, but so was the second in the pile, and the third and the fourth... I asked the lady at the counter if they had any clean ones. Not a word from her, she just continued discarding dirty trays until she found a semi clean one and gave it to me.Food was almost ok but the prices were outrageous. I do understand that rent in such a landmark building must be high but still.Only one of the employees, a very polite lady, seemed to know what she was doing and how to treat customers.There is another restaurant at the other end on the building. Mostly local food, better service and much, much cleaner

Weekends, crowded is a given. Poor management of assigning patrons to the seat, due to an open concept, there's only one staff placed at one side. One large group was seated at one of the ends and hogging up the whole area, even seats that they don't need. Ordered a low-fat drink, poor cashier got teased heavily with all the jargons of low-fat milk in front of a patron apparent it should be called skim milk but they used LOW-FATmilk. False advertising and the pursuit to be seen as hipster cafe is condescending, especially in such a national heritage place. They select (LOCAL) patron to collect their own drinks while offered to bring it to others (?) Sub-standard treatments are given. The food tastes mediocre. extremely poor management, terrible experience with steep prices. Not worth going
2
Prices are too steep for a casual cafe style and for the small portions.Many items not available on menu when I was there right at dinner time (7pm). Was told I couldn't use entertainer or Amex discount for special menu items AND full rack of ribs, but I was allowed to use it for steak and fries (same price as full rack of ribs!!). Amex discount was also only for mains, whereas other places (even Prego etc at swissotel) will be 50% off total food bill. The waves of rejections made me feel resigned and I ended up not enjoying my meal even though the food quality is up to par. Three stars simply for the polite and chirpy cashier guy who didn't mind me changing orders after I found out about all the offers I couldn't get.Unlikely to visit again though.

Came here to have a dinner. Brown rice was cold and certainly did not have a wow factor. At around 8pm, we ordered some ice cream from the menu and requested for coffee as well. The service staff said that the kitchen was closing, not completely closed yet and yet they could not make the extra effort to scoop some ice cream. this all happened on a Saturday night, in the National Gallery, on the day of an NDP rehearsal. We eventually settled for a green tea (one of the few items they still had left), and they were going to serve the tea in a disposable cup... until we requested for it to be served in a proper cup. Could not sense any warmth from the service staff, even more shocking as it being in a tourist attraction in Singapore.

The soy ginger salmon is my Favourite. Had it once again and was not disappointed. I will definitely be back for more.
4
Was pleasantly surprised. The set up pretty much matched that of a cafe, but the food was phenomenal! Staff also went the extra mile to ensure that the desserts were served just on time. Overall a fantastic experience.
3
The food was fresh and tasty. I enjoyed the brown rice, mixed grains with chicken very much. However, i was disappointed they stop serving water.
3
Gallery & Co is a cozy place but serves medicore food. The fries are too salty. Service staff quite helpful.
5
We had the otak otak taco. Serving was a little small but taste was fantastic. You won't go wrong with this item on the menu.
Staff were friendly too, but downside is that they do not serve tap water.
1
The food here is expensive. For the price I expect bigger portions, than again to be fair, the rent at the National Gallery should be quite expensive, hence the small portions of food at high prices. Maybe my food choice was wrong, I didn't really like their fusion kind of food, tasted strange and didn't taste good. The curry chicken on rice and eggplant salad was horrible, steak was small and tough for the price, otak taco came with 2 small miserable pieces of taco

Being weekend the place was rather crowded. Lucky I had the foresight to make a reservation before coming. But there was no reservation counter at the place, so I decided to join the queue to place order. It was quite a long wait as the queue moved quite slowly. Most will wait until its almost their turn to order then quickly grab a menu. The problem was most had not decided their order when it was their turn at the cashier. Wish that people had decided their order before queuing, not queuing because other people were queuing.When it was my turn to order, I told the staff about my reservation who gave me a as if not my business look. The other staff standing next to him, heard me and went out to look for a table. Interestingly it was my turn to order, the staff seemed to be busy with other stuffs. Took awhile to get his attention. One would be given a pager which acted more like a table number for the staffs to bring the dishes to you.This month the cafe just added a YAYOI Special Food Menu which consisted of an Appetiser ($12++), Main Dish ($25++), Dessert ($12.50++), and Bobba Tea ($7.50++).Main Dish ($25++)Pan-seared chicken, quinoa, fregola, pumpkin puree, pickled seasonal vegetables, shimeji mushroom The serving looked a tab too small. Overall not bad except for the slightly too salty over seasoned chicken.Dessert ($12.50++)Coconut mousse, mango curd and cubes, pumpkin sponge, pumpkin biscuitNice presentation with the pumpkin item served on a gold dusted black colored plate. The sponge was rather thin that one could barely tasted it. Overall it was overwhelmed by the coconut taste. The mousse was soft and light.Bobba Tea ($7.50++)black tea, passion fruit syrup, strawberry syrup, chia seeds, dragon fruit balls, tadpole IQ ballsThe drink was quite pretty in look. The drink was too sweet, lacking of the tea flavour. The tadpole balls gave bouncy texture

I don't see the restaurant enforcing on the use of reservation because patrons who did not make any reservation, will just sit on the reserved table. It's like a first come first serve basis. While i am lucky to get a empty table, it may not be the same. So no point of making a reservation in my opinon if the restaurant does not enforce it
3
The food was decent, thou portions was really small for some of the new items. The good-looking service staff seemed abit pretentious, well I thought they could have been abit more warm and smiley. Nice environment to chill out in for a quiet afternoon though it it can get really packed on weekends with the family crowds
1
The place is totally unsuitable for taking reservation. We made our reservation a few days before the date and had received the confirmation from Chope, but when we arrived, there was no seats reserved for us. They do not have our reservations in their list. We had to wait (just like normal patrons) to get a table. My friend who had also made the reservation on the same day same time also experienced the same situation. The "restaurant" was a self service concept similar to food court where patrons find your own seats and queue for your own food.If not for the amex credit card promotion for 50% off main course, the food, ambience and services are not worth the price
3
Came here for lunch today with a friend and opted for the spiced lamb. Quite tasty but the lamb was very fatty and the serving size was small. Still hungry afterwards. On the plus side service was efficient.
5
Had a good Saturday brunch with friends. The place looks a little understaffed though! The price point is reasonable.
5
Kitchen closes at 5pm, 2 hours before their closing hence I was not able to try their cooked food. Got the ondeh cake and a glass of mocha. I would say its average.
4
The cafe was nicely decorated and was a nice quiet place for chilling the afternoon away. Food was very decent as well.
4
Food is special and is value for money. The cake and dessert is good especially the oneh oneh cake. Highly recommend For this place.
5
it was nice place for a brunch at the national gallery. food was nice and service was good. no service charge so you have to order at the counter.
4
decent food, prices are reasonable, excellent cake and coffee. However i found the dumpling soup a little too light.
4
I've been comin regularly just for the delicious salmon dish. Coupled with Amex platinum 50% it is real value for money!

For a eatery that is the anchor tenant at the lovely National Gallery, this cafe disappoints in every aspect.First of all, all the tables are arranged to face the self-return stations which was an eyesore and appetite turnoff.Then I ordered the mixed grain bowl as recommended by the server. It was delivered some 15 minutes later, so I was expecting at least warm food. Nay. Everything was cold. And the rice was dry and hard as if it had sat out in the air con space without any care to ensure it stays edible.Terrible experience

Earl Grey, English Breakfast teas not served here. When I asked whether the cafe will ever serve more traditional teas like those requested, the response was, "I'm sorry I don't know, I only work here." I don't think she meant to sound curt, just lacked etiquette. Anyway, I did politely hint that was the very reason I directed the question to her because she worked here. We ordered cappuccino instead but regrettably it came lukewarm! :-( Do something management
5
Nice ambience with great food! The server were polite and the chef came to check if all is good! Loved the steak and fries and the otak and bulgogi taco! Will definitely be back again!
4
Very nice place at a great central location. Good food. Helpful staff. They even have a shopping area for you to purchase nice local artwork!
5
Brought my friend to try the otak otak and pork collar rice - still delish as before! He was raving about the dishes. Coffee's badly made though - diluted mocha. Loving the ambience too! After that, we had a walk back to the train station.
3
It was quiet and nice until lunch time wwhe it became crowded with families with kids.. the enture place so can be very of noisy. Probably is because is sunday.
5
I loved the food here. It looked fantastic, smelled delicious and its taste did not disappoint. It is good for the level of the general gallery café food. I would definitely happily make it one food stop for my future visits back to Singapore.
2
Overall, poor customer service! Why bother taking reservation when there is nobody keeping track? There is a "Wait to be seated" sign but really, this is more of a grab your own seat establishment.
5
Loved the Honey Glazed Iberico Pork collar with Tamari Butter Boiled Mushrooms. The meat and mushrooms were well done. Could have done with more rice though. I also tried the eggplant salad. Liked the crunch of the apple bits but it was a tad bit tasteless. Besides that, I loved the atmosphere of the place and great thought put to the design.
4
I like the ambience overall. Good place to come alone if you want to do some work or some reading. Good place to also hang out with some friends over coffee and tea. It's easy to get to from City Hall MRT, just 5 mins away.
5
Had lunch with friends. Order from counter format. Had a whole bunch of German tourist before us. I must admit, the staff was fast and polite and handled the crowds well. Food wise, it wasn't too bad but on the steeper side as portions were small. I love the lamb wanton! Steak wasn't the best but at least it was worth eating. Wish they would have some sea salt at the side to enhance the taste. It was such a pity the Flavours didn't come out. Wish they would serve complimentary water
5
We took a break from visiting the National Gallery, and had lunch here. It was not easy finding a table, but we managed. I had two salads (eggplant and marinated beet quinoa). My wife had the chicken dumplings. Both very good, especially if you like your dumplings on the spicy side. The chocolate cake had too much sugar, and the coffee was very strong. Otherwise, a good lunch, and not expensive
4
Restaurant was clean, cosy and ambience was great for dating. Food serving was unexpectedly small but tasted fantastic!
5
I made a reservation for two on a Tuesday evening. Nice concept, food was great. Really loved the ambience!
4
Ground floor of National Gallery, original and nice food.
Good collection of beer and wine. Nice spot in the evening or for when they have events.
3
Came here for lunch today and opted for the chicken leg. This came with some rice and a small salad including egg plant. I'm really not a big fan of egg plant at all. Rest of it was ok though. Service was efficient enough and plenty of seats.
5
Dishes were a fusion of Asian and western flavours. Been here twice, tried a variety of dishes and my fav has to be the otah otah tacos - refreshingly spicy and well balanced by the acidity of the accompanying fillings. Sweet potato taro pie is a green light too! :
4
Gallery & Co is a great cafe for the family. Located in the National Gallery Singapore, the kids have more than enough activities to occupy them while the adults can sit down to a delicious meal in a cafe with a relaxing vibe. The shop next to it sells nice books, bags and other lifestyle products with a Singaporean twist. The coffee is good and the Otak Otak Taco as well as the Beef Taco are must-eats. After or before your meal, a walk around the galleries is a must
4
Went there with a group of friends as we heard much about the ambience of the entire place. True enough it was really lively and bustling with people (mainly families with children) and the food was decent. However the counter staff didn't seem very well prepped for the crowd & was quite rude to me and my friend. We waited about 20 minutes for our food, but thankfully the quality made up for it
3
Ambience was cosy, lively and great for chilling. Ordered the otak tacos and chicken dumpling sound, both were decent with a pretty small portion. Price was on the steep side but fortunately the entertainer app allowed me to enjoy 2 mains at the price of 1.
3
A chic cafe in the newly opened National Gallery, good for a coffee or light meal but their menu is very limited and so are the tables. Food is of reasonable standards and pricing if you manage to find a table and order what you like before it sells out
4
This place stands out more for its cafe than the museum gift shop attached to it, in my opinion. I enjoyed the open seating at the cafe and it's occupied by local artsy folk and business people alike. This place has a wider and tastier selection of food than the Padang cafe in the opposite building. However, the gift shop next to the cafe is really pricey. I guess the museum has the final say of prices, but if you want local-inspired gifts without the crazy price tag, check out Naiise or megafash. Unless you want museum-specific goods, I recommend going elsewhere for gifts
