Poor service, poor management, overpriced cocktails. 5 star prices with one star service, disappointing. Totally unworthy the price you pay

I came to the bar on Saturday night and ended up returning every day for 3 nights (till I left SG). The wonderful, kind staff with Carmichael, Hermes (head bartender), Lucas (assistant manager) and Michael (assistant general manager) pampered me so well and made me the best drinks ever! Lucas was very attentive and lovely, Carmichael, Hermes and the rest of the staff created magic in my drinks, and succumbed to my every whim. I had the best time every time I came and I can't wait to return. The music, vibe, views and people make it one of the best bars I've been to in my travels. If you're in Singapore - Having a drink (or 5 ) at Spago Bar should definitely be on your must to do list!
5
If I could say one thing I remember from my visit to Spago it would be the barman slicing the giant ice cube so professionally and so unnecessarily to make my "love you long time" cocktail After a few more of those cocktails the evening was a fantastic blur, and one i wont forget in a hurry.
4
We dropped in after dinner for some cocktails and wine.The hostess was very welcoming even when the venue was bulging at the seams.At first we were seated at the bar and we ordered some cocktails and looked at ordering wine when we were moved to a table.The service at the table was beyond expectation; our waitress was serving many tables, but managed to be at our table often to make sure we were looked after.The wine was ordered at the able and arrived relatively quickly; the cocktails ordered previously at the bar must have gotten lost in the system, as they did not arrive until well into drinking the bottle of wine. The bartenders were under pressure for sure; just one of those glitches I guess.On the costly side, but a great vibe for certain; we will be back
5
We visited Spago Bar & Lounge principally to see the sunset over Singapore and enjoy a drink. We were pleasantly surprised with the easy access to the bar and the attentive service we received from all the staff but particularly from Kristina and Lucas Ketir. In addition to drinks we had some excellent snacks. We enjoyed the evening so much that we decided to have dinner at the Spago Restaurant two nights later and Kristina kindly made the necessary arrangements for us. Whilst having dinner Lucas came into the restaurant to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The dinner was excellent and we will certainly return to Spago on our next visit to Singapore
5
This place will be my favourite place, Located top of MBS, the view was fantastic.You can enjoy Singapore city and garden view with a nice breeze.I was thinking of having some finger food and cocktails, but food was so good couldn't stop ordering food, I cancelled my dinner and stayed at Spago with my friends longer than we expected. Also, cocktail is remarkably good too, It’s best to place for a date or hang out with friends.I highly recommend bringing a family, friends who visiting SG too
5
Most people go to Spago for the view, I go for the consistently on point food (best karaage ever, potstickers, laksa springroll, tuna cones and am obsessed with their sushi), delicious cocktails and lovely service.I am difficult and have been let down at so many different establishments in Singapore but I have never had a bad time at Spago. Honest truth
5
Went to Spago with some of my friends for cocktails and to see the amazing view of Singapore. Gardens by the bay landscape and sea view on one side then the infinity pool and city lights on the other, what more could you ask for. Staff were nice and attentive. Cocktails were so good. I recommend rough love and grin n bare it. And the food is to die for. Try the KARAAGE!. overall a great experience and my friends and I were not disappointed. Will be back there again. Definitely recommended

We stopped for a drink here before dinner at the Spago Restaurant. There are many different sitting areas in this open air pavilion on the top of this amazing building. We enjoyed one of their signature drinks "Peace & Love", which comes in a giant goblet with an orchid. The views from both sides were just spectacular--on one side you see the infinity pool and the city of Singapore beyond; on the other you see the sea. Service was not great, but we fully enjoyed the experience!
4
We indulged in pre-dinner drinks at the Spago bar prior to our meal in the adjacent restaurant (which is the subject of a separate review).Our waiter was exceptionally helpful and friendly, and we enjoyed our drinks as the sun set over the financial high-rise district of Singapore. The views in the other direction towards the sea were equally amazing, overlooking the gardens and domes and the super tree grove.There was certainly a buzz about this place which added to the atmosphere, so it was quite an unique experience, and definitely worth the expense.If you haven’t arranged to eat at the restaurant or if you aren’t staying at the hotel, I would recommend booking a reservation, as the place was packed 
5
Went for breakfast on floor 57 and it was fantastic! Great choice and tasted good too! Not mentioned the view yet but that is pretty special too!
4
I had breakfast here while staying in the hotel. The buffet spread was very good and vast. Though the place was little crowded, the service was good. Enjoyed the food here with a splendid view provided by the restaurant.
4
Just besides famous swimming pool over Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Relaxed location with good wine and drinks. Outstanding view of Singapore from sky deck ..
5
Instead of spending $25 to go on to the viewing deck, we spent $26 each on a cocktail here. It was easy to book on line, tasty and far less stressful. I highly recommend it!!
3
Came here for happy hour with some friends. It has an amazing view and a good happy hour menu ($14 for a glass of wine versus $30 on the normal menu). On the HH menu we also ordered the Laksa spring rolls that were amazing!! However I give them 3 stars b/c the service was very bad. We had to flag down a server multiple times and it took forever to get the bill. That part was pretty annoying.

In summary, ok but better to go to Ce La Vie or the main Spago’s.We went for evening drinks and a light supper while we stayed at the hotel for over a week. While it is on the same level as the infinity pool, the main Spago’s restaurant, and Ce La Vie, the view here is only good if you sit at the bar. Otherwise it could be any trendy bar with outdoor seating. Better to go to Ce La Vie for late night drinks and the view or Spago’s for food or the viewing platform if you just want to see Singapore.Wind and rain are a significant factor on some nights, which means you either sit at the bar which is raised and see everything but experience nature’s full force coming off the sea, or you huddle at a lower elevation table behind glass dividers and view obscuring shrubbery.Oddly, the food was nowhere near as good as would have been expected given they are attached to Spago’s. We did eat at Spago’s another night and I can confirm the menus are totally different. Spago Bar and Lounge only serves bar food. Lamb chops were tasty albeit very small. The quail was crispy but a bit dry / over cooked, good use of Thai sweet and chilli sauce though. But the beef (mince) sliders were so gristly that each one had something completely inedible in it. Staff very friendly. Some seats were dirty while others were broken or had worn cushions that they were uncomfortable after five minutes of sitting.Mixed clientele including families with children, older Caucasian and Asian gentlemen with their “dates”, 30 something locals looking for a pickup, and a few really underdressed folks in shorts and t shirts (hotel guests?) despite a smart casual policy. Wine list was from Spago’s so that was good.Overall, I think they could do more with what they have. At a minimum, serve better food
3
We went to Spago for lunch and were very excited to be in famous Marina Bay Sands right at the top. Spago is a beautiful place, with nice interiors and amazing view. Nice crowd. Our experienced was a bit ruined by service, the waiter didn't know the menu, couldn't explain the dishes, and overall impression of service is not enjoyable. Food is good, but not exceptional. I had prawn salad and would recommend it
2
I had barely sat down and started my meal that the waitress brought me the bill and see yo indicate that I should be on my way. I had to constantly ask for coffee. The food was ol but the English muffin for egg Benedict was under cooked. For the price 50 SGP I was disappointed. Great view however
1
Sat at the bar with my husband while we waited to check into our MBS room and we’re essentially ignored by the 4 bar staff for the entirety of our stay. Lounge was not busy. Had to flag down someone every time we wanted more water, $22 USD drinks, etc. not at all what I would expect from a world renowned resort. Food and drinks were good and being outside was nice but the lack of overall service and hospitality ruined the experience. Major bummer.
5
My husband and I decided to get babysitting for our children and have a quick night out in Singapore at Spago after a recommendation from a friend. It was such a wonderful night sitting at the bar chatting to the bar tenders and enjoying the views, cocktails and bar food on offer. The ceviche and pork are amazing and the cocktails delicious. It is expensive but well worth it for a special night out on holidays
3
This place is only worth it for the view. Expensive and service is not pro active enough which is surprising for a high priced place like this. Food is good but not fantastic.
4
Food is good in the high class. Therefore it is expensive, in small dishes but quality is justified. Not recommended for kids as not much for them to eat, but for business dinner or lunch it is the place.
5
The staff is amazing.
I'd love to be able to hire like they do. Every person is extremely helpful and gracious.
One in particular is a taller, Eastern European/Maybe Russian girl at the back.
Just a great Spirit.

It must be said at the outset that Spago is not all that easy on the wallet. But saving the costs of heading up to the observation desk offset the restaurant bill. We had excellent gourmet burgers while looking out at what is billed as the worlds largest rooftop infinity pool. It really is a sight for sore eyes. It’s almost enough to make me stay at Marina Bay Sands next time so that I can be one of the hotel guests laying about in that marvelous pool
3
Service was terrible. No order to what wait staff look after who.Exceptionally expensive. AUD $18 for a serving of fries. Alcoholic cocktails were well made. Salmon salad had pickled cucumber and turnips. Not to my taste. Staff couldnt find salt or pepper to save themselves
3
Went to the lounge for a drink and some light bite. We ordered the Grilled USDA prime beef sliders (very tasty, highly recommended) and pork pot sticker dumplings (just okay, no need to waste money on it). For drinks we had classic mojitos (on the sweet side). Great view and nice deco but the chairs and sofas were very dirty. A lot of old stains on the cushions and some of the pillows/cushions were very flat (needs to put more foam on the cushions). The place looks run down and dirty. One of the Chinese waitress was very friendly but the waitress that settled our bill look very sad and not happy at all.
1
I was at the Spago bar and lounge sitting down waiting to place my order and I saw how dirty stained and unclean all the cushion covers, chairs and couches were. It looks so unhygienic I would’ve walked out if it were not for the fact I was a guest. If this is the way they keep their lounge clean what happens in the kitchen?The mind boggles!

SPAGO located on 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Previously on this place was located the club of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and later they changed to SPAGO. I like to come here from time to time since it was opened and this year I've decided even to host my small birthday party here and the service was excellent. From all the restaurants on top of Marina Bay Sands, it has the best view on famous Infinity Pool and on Gardens By the Bay on the other side. If you don't stay in the hotel, it's your only chance to have a front view and make some good pool view photos! If you require a formal dining, it's better to go for SPAGO Restaurant. SPAGO Lounge has less food options, but the prices are much more affordable and atmosphere is more relaxed and cheerful. Even food menu is quite short, all the things I've tried including crab, burgers, oysters, salads, sushi and rolls, all were good. It's normally a que of people on Friday/Saturday, so better make a prior reservation. The worst thing is to get here, as it's slightly complicated. You need to go to a Tower 2 of MBS, take a special lift to 55th floor and later take a lift to 57th floor. For the first time it may be challenging.
5
Visited tonight during happy hour and got a table without a reservation no problem. The bar is comfortable with lovely, attentive staff. The cocktails are delicious and large. The food smelled and looked amazing, although we didn't have any. But the best part is the views out over the infinity pool with the Singapore skyline behind, and the gardens by the bay on the other side. Thoroughly enjoyable
5
A really vibrant lounge up on the pool level of the hotel. Great atmosphere, very good service, excellent view to beat no other and really good food. We both had the burger and it was delicious served with a huge portion of fries. All types of drinks from cocktails, wine to bubbly
5
Lovely buffet breakfast with lots to choose from , was busy but good staff helped with ordering etc. View of city is great, excellent way to start the day.
4
This place is definitely impressive and charming. They serve nice food and innovative cocktails. A must try !
5
Sitting at Spago and looking out at the pool was one of the highlights of my trip. A bit pricey I thought, but if you only go once, its worth it.
5
We were glad we treated ourselves to this very special venue. Not only for the refreshing drinks and yummy snacks but the fabulous views. We enjoyed it so much we had to go back again two days later. Staff were courteous and efficient. We had a minor issue on our second visit regarding the "happy hour" which was resolved amicably and professionally and more importantly - with a smile. Look forward to visiting again next year

Yesterday, I met up with my friend from Taiwan, and we went to have our lunch at Spago Bar & Lounge, located at the roof top of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.Spago has a fine Dining Room, as well as the Bar and Lounge, and both are on the 57th floor, beside the famous Infinity Pool. The two separate restaurants and bar belong to the celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck, and he is the only chef who had won the James Beard Foundation Award for Outstanding Chef of the Year twice.We had a lovely day, and it was very breezy. And we could enjoy the panoramic view of the city skyline. The food served here is the California cuisine. My friend ordered the Grilled Angus Beef Burger, while I ordered the spaghetti (Trippa ala Romana), since I wanted to have a full meal, thus the decision to ask for the pasta.In a short while, we were served our food. After spending sometime to arrange the food to take some insta shots, we realized that we had not been served the drinks which we had ordered. When a lady staff came to our lady, we told her about the drinks. She apologized for the wait and soon after, she not only served us our drinks, but also informed us that the drinks would be made compliment for us! Thumbs up to her gesture to please the patrons.As for the food, I must say that the Grilled Angus Beef Burger was excellent. Tasty bread, with the high quality Angus Beef. Gruyere and Cheddar Cheese with onions and garlic were the ingredients. Well, for the Spaghetti (Braised Tribe - some kind of lining in the stomach of farm animals, with Veal sweetbreads), it was a surprise to me to get so small a portion, as I often get very generous serving at Five Star Hotels. Nevertheless, the spaghetti was very tasty with ricotta cheese, pecorino cheese, mint and parsley. I would give a rating of 8.5 for the burger and 8 for the spaghetti.It was overall a very pleasant dining experience on the rooftop, with excellent views, high quality food. The atmosphere is very casual, relaxed, with the gentle breeze.I would like to suggest for those who like to go up to Spago, to have dinner instead. After the sunsets, the next hour - the blue hour with the sky not turning dark, the best timing to take excellent photos with the various office towers in the background.
5
Excellent food, fast and precise service. Very friendly and professional staff. Lucas, one of the managers made our day with his endless hospitality. Since we are new here we had plenty of questions to ask about food and wine, the venue the surroundings and about the city. We were absolutely impressed by how knowledgeable, friendly and approachable he was. We really appreciate that he always found a minute to deal with us while organizing his excellently-presented and super-pro' team. We definitely recommend to dine with these guys at least once while you are here. The salted caramel souffles was the best dessert I have ever had in my life and that's one of the reasons why I am so sure I will be back.
4
Really stunning views over Singapore and I would say def worth going. But service a little bit and miss. Friendly some of them but forgetful shall we say. I would have preferred to stay here to enjoy the infinity pool with the view. Nice food and worth coming up to for the view.
5
Went to Spago last night for a bit of a classy evening with my Dad. We had a great table reserved looking out onto the infinity pool and the whole of Singapore. Completelt magical experiences helped out by our lovely hostess called Kristina who was amazing. She was so friendly and welcoming. She introduces us to a lovely Philipino desert called "halo halo" that I very much recommend! Also had a gorgeous cocktail and some amazing exotic bar food! First class experience! Just wish I could have had a swim in the infinity pool
5
We had drinks and some light bites here and really enjoyed it.The food was lovely, the views were amazing at night and the cocktails and drinks were works of art.Every member of staff was very friendly and helpful and the whole atmosphere was very cool.Loved it

My wife and I went to eat here for my birthday dinner.Finding the place was a pain and when we found out where it was we had to take three lifts to get there and also had a problem using the lifts as we were not staying in the hotel and had no room card to use the lifts.Upon arriving at the restaurant desk we asked for table for two and were told it was full. We were then asked if we would like to be seated in the lounge bar area and we said yes. We were seated at a low small table in the middle off the area and noticed reserved tags on a lot of the surrounding tables with views.We were given the drinks and food menu and struggled to read them as it was so dark, others were having the same problem. Ten minutes later someone came to ask us what we would like to drink and we ordered a water and a gin. Fifteen minutes later we received them . We then waited for over twenty minutes to order food and never got any service at all. Eventually I stopped someone to get the drinks bill , this was the fastest thing I got all night !! There were certainly plenty of servers in the place but they didn't seem to have a clue what to do. The poor service , noisey music , bad lighting and difficulty in finding the place put me off for good.We left and went to db in the sands shopping mall. The difference in service was like night and day !
4
Nice lounge bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands. Bar food us very good although expensive but you know that before you go up there. Drinks and food menu is extensive. Certainly worth the trip
5
Went with friends for drinks and snacks and hat the greatest time. Amazing views from the 57th floor. Awesome drinks and great food. 5 stars all around!
5
I have visited, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills, but this Spago in Tower 2 at Marina Bay Sands, is a WOW experience! The views are amazing!! This is definitely a GO to place, if you have dined at other Spagos, around the world.
5
Very good ambience and what a view for a rooftop bar! Very good cocktails too! One of the to do list if you're in Singapore ! Highly recommended.
4
Yes, it's expensive at $26 a cocktail, but this is Singapore and there are happy hour promotions to be had. That said, get a seat by the bar at sunset, see the infinity pool on one side and the harbour on the other while enjoying a well-made cocktail, and enjoy the experience. When we visited the bar staff were busy, but attentive and the drinks were good. We are pleased we came!
5
I’ve visited Spago bar a few times with friend. The view is the best, vibe is unpretentious and service is friendly. Drinks are pricey but you’re paying for the view. It’s defo best rooftop bar at MBS. Spago dining room is also fabulous. I came here with family for lunch. They have a really good deal on the set lunch. Service was friendly and attentive, and food was delicious. Nothing too complex, just honest good food. The only improvement would be cost of wines by the glass, starting from around $24 for a simple red!
3
A real shame as we expected something better than what we received. Service was good. Choice of dishes was good. Presentation and flavours ok. Views were almost non exsistent which was surprising when considering we are on the 57th floor. Revisited for breakfast and variety was smaller than expected. We were told by hotel staff that it served American breakfasts yet the offering was far from the expected. Will dine at alternate venues within MBS in the future
3
The one thing Spago has going is the great view. Although I would recommend the garden view because the city view aka the pool view may not always be that attractive depending who is swimming in there. The open bar is great for people watching although can feel more hectic with the human traffic. The service is generally good although the last time I was there, they seemed short handed and a little hassled. The food and drinks are good. But be warned, when it pours and it’s windy, the whole place gets the rain and no matter where you are seated, you will get rained on. There are also structural flaws in the place that causes the rain to splash into the terrace when it pours. It is such a shame given the building is only recently built, our tropical rains are infamous that no thought was given to the rooftop when it was designed. We had to move tables three tines and cut short our time there eventually when the rain got to us even when standing in the middle of the terrace restaurant. In fact when we were leaving, we noticed the bar was covered with plastic sheets which only meant it is a regular occurrence. It be great if we could be rained in instead of rained out at Spago
3
its very hard to rate this place... We only had bar food and what we did have was very good quality BUT for the price we paid I would have hoped so! Im all in for paying for quality but this really was expensive and I cant help but feel they are cashing in on the fact people want to come here simply for the view from the top of Marina Bay Sands. And, if im honest, the view isn't perfect as you cant actually get to a good vantage point anywhere due to the pool being at one end. It was fabulous to see it but if all you're after is the view then maybe just pay the $20 to go to the observation deck. I cant argue that the food was good but was it worth the price tag...im not so sure
4
Make sure you go here for drinks at sunset. Enter via marina bay sands hotel (tower 2) and take the lifts to the top floor, do not need to be a hotel resident. Drinks menu is extensive and the view both sides of the hotel are incredible. One looks out over the infinity pool and towards the financial district and the other towards the docks / boat area. Drinks are expensive ($26ish for a cocktail + tax etc) but it is great for a novelty visit to watch the sunset one evening
5
Great location to take in the view over Singapore. Wine and service excellent. Iconic location that must be done.
5
Great place to check out the views of the city. They have a "reasonable" (this is Singapore so nothing is cheap here) Monday - Thursday from 4pm to 7pm. The staff was very attentive and the sunset was beautiful. I'll be back!
Hi You

Reserving a table for Spago provides much better value than going to the viewing deck if you want to get to the top of Marina Bay Sands. We had done this multiple times before, but our last experience was a disappointment. As we were wrapping up, we were informed that because we were a party of 8, we had an $800 minimum. That is their policy and is understandable, so we ordered another round of drinks from our server, expecting them to be delivered quickly so that we could drink them and be on our way. We waited over an hour. Ultimately, they did not bring the drinks and let us leave with our bill at slightly less than $800, but it ruined the remainder of our night as we did not have time to meet our friends at Haji Lane. All in all, we were very disappointed
2
It is located on level 57 of the Marina Bay Sands Tower 2. Make sure you get here early because the Marina Bay Sands is so large that you can get easily lost. The location of this is impressive because it overlooks the famous infinity pool where every guest of the hotel is trying to get a selfie. This restaurant is not air-conditioned so make sure you wear comfortable clothes as everything is outdoors. The website and information that you receive will state you can't wear shorts or thongs. However, everyone we saw was wearing shorts because it gets so hot up there. The food is okay but so overrated. We also ordered iced coffees which were disgusting. The worsted iced coffee we had ever had
5
I had lunch here today at the Terrace Bar and it was really very nice . Apart from being on the 57th floor with an amazing views. I chose the Spring Rolls and the Red Snapper both really delicious and very nicely presented.Impeccable service and I was really glad I chose to have lunch there today . I would love to come back 
4
I had one of the few best Mojito in Spago. Loved the ambient (open air concept bar) but it can be a little sweaty and heat during the day. Located on the 57th floor of Marina May Sands, Tower 2 you can have almost 360 degree view of the area. The seating were comfortable and also very professional bartenders/waiters. You may want to make prior booking by calling them because this place is crowded especially evening onwards. It can be a little pricey for Asians but the rest, enjoy and please try their Mojito

We had overseas guests who wanted an MBS view of Singapore - atop the famous boat. For years, we had entertained at Sky at 57 by Chef Justin Quek but the restaurant closed in June this year. So the next best alternative was the buffet breakfast at Spago. It bears Wolfgang Puck's name so we would expect good food but we were sorely disappointed. It did not even come close to the quality that we used to enjoy at Sky. Entry was at Tower 2 and dining was alfresco for breakfast. The view was stunning even though you don't really get access to the infinity pool. So we settled for breakfast and looked at the spread. Plenty of choices and there was an eggs station where you could order Eggs Benedict or even local fare such as 'Nasi lemak' or fishball noodles. There was the usual array of Western items - bacon, sausages, cold cuts, fruits and an assortment of breads. They also served dim sum and congee.The question that begs to be asked is - was the food good? Sadly, no. The congee was cold, the dim sum hard and tasted factory made and nasi lemak needed more condiments to make it faintly interesting.We would expect better since it is Puck's Spago. But I'm afraid it failed to impress. Service was good ... and that was the only saving grace. Would I go back with guests? No. I think we would have to seek options elsewhere. Certainly not worth the $53 per person charged
5
We couldn't book for lunch but did one better by going to the rooftop bar where we spent a delightful afternoon watching people go by, looking at the view of Singapore and the stunning infinity pool. It isn't cheap but if viewed as a trip out it was worth every penny. We had a huge plate each of burger and fries, a pudding to share, large glass of wine, beer and of course a cocktail for approx Â£100. After 4 there are sundowner special cocktails at half the price but we had arrived much earlier. Make this a part of your visit especially if you're waiting for a late flight home. Impeccable service, a stunning end to our holiday
3
Came here for a celebration meal for the five of us Struggled to get a seat in the main roof bar as it was full of people taking photos of the viewWe then walked a few yards to the restaurant avoiding hordes of swimmers wearing towels and not much elseAlso smell of pool made me feel I was at the local swimming baths Ina heatwave Food and service in restaurant was impeccable and on its own definitely five stars, but as an experience not sure at over $1,000 dollars it was worth it!!
5
We came here for sundowner cocktails and to watch Supertree Grove light show from above. If you aren't staying at the hotel, this is the best place to see the amazing infinity pool. Cocktails were in huge glasses with orchids in some. There is a viewing platform looking down onto Gardens on the bay. We stayed for a couple of hours and yes it was expensive but well worth it for us
2
as I was staying in the Marina Bay, I have had breakfast here one morning and it was really average considering the caliber of the Hotel and the Wolfgang Puck brand. Nothing to say about the view and the service which was good though.
5
The food is just sublime! Everything we had was heavenly. The cocktails are good too. Nice service overlooking the infinite pool gives a feeling of a nice club. The spring roll and the guava cocktail are highly recommended.
5
Whilst staying in the MBS, I decided 1 night to enjoy drinks on the top floor. Was not disappointed!! The bartenders where great, friendly and accommodating. Tried a couple cocktails off their menu, and then had another few chosen by the bartender. All this whilst admiring a great view of the sunset over Singapore business district
5
What a fantastic experience. The views from the 57th floor let you see all the way to Indonesia.The staff were friendly but very professional.The food was excellent although we thought it would have had less Asian influence in it and be a bit more European.The Lounge area is also great. you can eat snacks there or just have drink and enjoy the ambiance
5
Dinner at Spago was interesting and different.Its location on the top floor of Marina Bay Sands means great views of on both sides of the restaurant. We sat in the lounge area and it was cool with the night breeze wafting through the restaurant.Service was top notch as we chatted with the service staff on our orders of cocktails and bite-sized meals. The food was served progressively and this was ideal in between our cocktails and conversations. From time to time, the staff would drop by to enquire about our dinner. This was done in a friendly way without coming across as the restaurant's procedural requirement.A lovely dinner in an upmarket yet casual environment. Great place to socialize and chill
5
We were so delighted with a nice breeze and comfy sofas after being in the heat for the whole morning. It felt like being a member of a country club with pool, mason pathways and gardens surrounding the bar. Didn't look like we were high above the ground unless you see the top of some skyscrapers. We had a nice cider and signature drinks, which were refreshing. Their light bites are delicious: fried spring rolls, pork buns and homemade fries. The prices, just as the place itself, are high above the other places on the ground. But, hey, you also pay for the view, the taste and the service, which were pretty excellent
3
Let's just say...it's Marian Bay Sands.(I live in this city since 14 years and saw this city growing and flourishing, including the restaurant scene) It's always all about the crowd, which I found rather "Kiasu" on this particular evening. Just very common crowd, tourists, a very loud crowd of Mainland Chinese Tourists (sorry, but that was very obvious) right beside us, occupying a big table (no big spenders), taking pictures, making lots of noise and just being, who they are. No dress code, no particular attire!We celebrated a friends' birthday, who visited from overseas and insisted on going to Spago. We enjoyed. The Russian Waitress was very attentive and obviously perfectly trained! Anyhow, worthwhile visiting, have a drink, enjoy the view and have dinner at CUT!And if you have the chance...visit Spago in L.A. Now that's what I call a "Puck"
5
Top of the building views and food in this well run restaurant. First the view-as you would expect from level 57-spectacular! Food a mixture of Asian fushion and western-all excellent. We had a mixture of fish and steak, all excellent. Wine list well provided for. A great evening but save up
5
My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary at Spago. We arrived to Singapore, checked into our hotel and within 2 hours we were at Spago's Lounge and bar for cocktails to enjoy the views over the marina area before it got dark. The views of the pool and skyscrapers in the background was amazing. The place was packed as it was the weekend. After our drinks we went to the restaurant were I booked a table. The staff were very friendly and service was second to none. Bree was very friendly and chatted with us. We ordered garden salad which was well displayed and decorated to the extent that you hate to eat it. The mains were even better. We ordered Sea Bass and Monkfish and shared them as they were so good and tasty. Desert was delicious as well as it was recommended to us but I can't remember the name. It was a night that will be in our memories for a long time. To make it even better all the staff signed a card wishing us a happy anniversary which was really very nice. Spago is well worth the price tag

I write this as a local - almost 10 years in Singapore. Spago is one of my favourite restaurants for a special occasion. This place is exceptional because of the sum of its parts: The restaurant is situated on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands building, by now iconic. The view is amazing, even after many visits. A drink in the Spago bar is recommended before dinner to make the most of this view. One also gets to see the hotel guests in the infinity pool which adds a curiosity factor. Incidentally, the bar offers excellent food - a choice of tapas style bites and a couple of mains. However, as the evening progresses, the noise level rises to an excruciating extent. The restaurant itself is an elegant affair with mostly indoor seating and a handful of small tables outside. We had tried the full tasting menu on the occasion of a 50th birthday celebration and various dishes from the regular menu at other visits. The service for the birthday was outstanding, during the other visits sufficiently competent. Food is understated fusion as far as I can tell. European cooking with Asian touches, it all works for me. It is very difficult to find outstanding cooking in Singapore, combined with memorable surroundings and competent service. Spago does all this very well.Note, children under 12 are not allowed in the main restaurant. Unless you ask nicely and make sure yours are very well behaved. They sometimes make an exception

What a view! Simply beautiful and the pool is amazing. We came for just drinks (and crusty French fries) which tasted fine. I really like the music, well chosen.

We had dinner at Spago Bar & Lounge, not the restaurant... But I've seen many reviews of the bar here and I didn't find the TA page for the bar, so I guess it is the same thing. It is located at the top of Marina Bay Sands, right next to its pool. The service is good, the staff is friendly. The food is actually delicious. The problem is that we paid a lot and we got out of there feeling pretty hungry. If they want to charge us that much (for example, I think the cheapest beer they had was 15SGD) for food and drinks because of the location, at least they could actually feed us, and not give us "samples" of food for the price of (almost) a whole meal in other restaurants. Anyway, the delicious things we tried were: Falafel Macaroon, a thing I've never seen before, but it was really good; an well-conceived Ceviche; some delicious Bruschettas (Truffle and Chesse); and they made us a special veggie sushi, which was also delicious. As we were hungry, we also had some Cheese Sandwich which tasted really good.It was indeed a delicious experience but I would never go back and pay so much for this amount of food and drinks

go up to level 55 and take another lift to level 57 towards Spago but tell the hostess you're here for the lounge at poolside to be ushered directly to a table!both times I was here I'd gone to the Spago Lounge that's poolside without a reservation and if you wanted a more restauranty atmosphere this isn't it! the food is prepped in the same kitchen but the selection will leave you wanting...a great view both sides overlooking the sea or bay with the infinity pool and a very breezy bistro without aircon, perfect if you love the poolside windswept...~Grilled Cheese Sandwich was the only unpretentious dish if you will~Chinese Bao & Glazed Short Rib oh so super YUMz x2~Chicken "Laksa" Spring Roll yes this hits the spot with some spicy YUMz x2~USDA Prime Cote de Bouef um this is not a size for 2 Asians it's huge and a bit like full on what you get at a good steak house... frankly this was best for more ppl~French Fries ordering a side doesn't add much more if you have a main dishI'd been in 2015Feb & Mar with colleagues so the menu prolly changed but hopefully they kept the heavy dishes inside the restaurant and the super fun light & local creations which are YUMz at loungeside :

We got a recommendation to visit Spago, have a drink and snack, then look at the great view from the 56th floor, overlooking Singapore. We were not disappointed. Furthermore, the staff was very kind and compassionate towards us, as we had lost our cruise ship to engine trouble, and were grounded in Singapore. They offered to take our picture, and show us around the bar, so we could see the view

We took our family out for dinner to say thank you for having us in Singapore. Spago was just lovely. The view alone is worth it, over the Singapore skyline and of course, the boats down in the harbour. We shared many dishes as we wanted to try everything. The laksa spring rolls, falafel macarons and the sliders were particular highlights. Cocktails are what you'd expect to pay for MBS and are delicious. Service was generally ok, though the bar became overwhelmed later in our stay. Would definitely visit again!!

Visited this restaurant at the weekend, and was very impressed with its breeziness and the atmosphere. Spectacular views on around, including the Skypark of the MBS hotel.Enjoyed some nice spring rolls, and some beer in a relaxed seating style. Not quite as expensive as some of the restaurants at MBS. Bar and restaurant are separate and I chose to dine in the bar section.Nice place to relax and great views

Personally I find Singapore a rather dull place, but a trip would never be complete without a visit to my favorite bar. Panoramic views from 57 floors in the sky; wonderful service; and the best gin martini (and margarita for that matter). Hours can fly by as you enjoy the high life. 'Big Up' to Hermes, my favorite bartender in the world :)Cheers, Alex & Jo

Had a few great visits here at our stay at Marina Bay Sands. We only tried out the bar and the food they had there, not the restaurant since the first night it was closed due to a private arrangement and the other night we did not think about making a reservation so the only time they had left was 10 in the evening. But the burgers in the bar was so good and we got so much food. The cocktails are also just amazing, we had some really nice evenings, can't complain about the view either and nice staff

You have to be on top of the Marina Bay Sands when in Singapore, and as I didn't just wanted to go to the observatory deck I decided to go to one of the restaurants and have a bite and a drink.Spago is the only one that opens fairly early, it is in the middle tower of the Marina Bay Sands and I thought to just go and have a look.It was absolutely brilliant, the view is worth a thousand bugs, and I was lucky to have a stunning sunset to go with that.The service was lovely, I was by myself and the ober was very kind, had a little chat with me although it was fairly busy. I ordered a gin tonic Lychee and some sushi and springrolls to go with it.It all looked very fancy and tasted perfect, the combination of location, service, and food quality made it the perfect experience worth every single penny

Spago has a buffet brunch which is around $30 - $35 US per person. Unfortunately, while the view is fantastic and the service is fine, the food leaves much to be desired. The offerings include standard western fare such as scrambled eggs and French toast, but there is also Chinese dim sum, both of which were very average. I cannot speak to their dinner quality, but it's hard to beat the location, so that's probably the only lure for brunch

10/10
From start to finish it was a great experience
The lounge menu is amazing as we had 90% of the menu to share
The service was 10/10 with very helpful and informative staff
Thankyou

Stayed at MBS and picked Spargo as the breakfast place since it has a spectacular view of the Marina Bay; continental spread with great presentation. The best part of it is the staff there, they were making recommendations despite it being a buffet. High touch service, enjoyed it and swam it all off after, definitely go back there again

I visited this bar for a cocktail before going to the MBS rooftop club. The service was great - friendly staff, chatty and happy to make any recommendations or provide assistance. The cocktail menu is varied although not a huge selection. It is on the pricey side however the cocktail are large (not in the usual martini glass!) and you definitely get your moneys worth in terms of quality. The view at night was also beautiful

My wife and I were away on our 50th wedding anniversary trip and stopped over for a few nights to visit with our daughter and family living in Singapore.My daughter secretly arrange our visit to Spago which is on the 57th floor of Marina Sands complex. Marina Sands is a place I have admired from afar so it was especially pleasing to actually visit and moreso because the restaurant is adjacent to the amazing infinity pool that looks across a 180 degree panorama. May I say for a start that there is a 'trick' (for want of a better word) that the service staff do that left all of us gobsmacked - 8 members in our party ordered from what I'd refer to as a 'tapa's' style menu and this young lass remembered our order without taking a note. That is 8 people ordering at least 1 item some ordered two and then made a change to what they wanted. She then recited everything back pointing to the individual who had ordered. ASTOUNDING!! And I noted this happened with all the waiters.I make special mention of the Manager Glyn. Ssooo helpful and knowledgable and when my wife asked about availability of New Zealand she went away and came back with the menu from the main restaurant section and "Voila!"! we ordered one of the best Sauvignon Blancs that we have tried. My daughter mentioned it was our 50th Anniversary and a lovely plate decorated with good wishes was presented to us. A lovely touch.The menu was efficient and had an interesting variation of choice that even suited a 'picky' grandson - a change for him from burger and fries!! :)) And tasty. We shared all the dishes between us and as I say in the heading - Flavour, flavour, flavour.The view was amazing, the Singapore weather beautifully mild by Singapore standard and the service and attention made for an exceptional night that we were all talking about several days later. Without doubt the best restaurant that I have visited this year and probably for several years.Very highly recommended. If I could rate higher starts I would

Spago is located on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Tower overlooking the infinity pool in the sky and the beautiful Singapore city scape. The food and service are world class. It's not an inexpensive restaurant but the service is so good it takes a bit of the shock out of the price. You can arrive early for cocktails al fresco. The view is great but the music is loud and makes intimate conversation impossible. The seating, while comfortable, is not conducive to good conversation either. Although you are only steps away from the incredible infinity pool (one of the best and most unique in the world), you may not enter the pool or walk on the pool deck without a pass as a guest of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The only unpleasant part of Spago is the first floor level entrance and chaos of the MBS Hotel. But once you reach the 57th floor it's worth it. Our meal was delicious, presented well by knowledgeable and friendly staff. The cocktails very very well made and the wine list is extensive. I am already planning my next trip back with visiting guests. If it's in your budget, don't miss it

On business and staying at the Marina Bay Sands. I decided to have a night cap on the 57th floor and have a drink at the Spago bar. I am sure there are plenty of reviews of the restaurant but I simply sat at the bar and enjoyed a beautifully presented Old Fashioned and some chicken laksa spring rolls. The service was excellent and it is great value for money. Easy to get in if you are resident at the hotel and I saw others pleading to get in. Worth it

We visited Spago on a weekday afternoon. We were there as we want to check out the Infinity Pool at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Might as well have an afternoon beer. Forget the air condition and embrace the Singapore's humid weather at this joint. I think the weather made the beer so much more enjoyable. We spent the next hour chillaxing with our ice cold beer

What a fantastic way to start the day, a morning swim in probably the best pool in the world followed by a very nice breakfast. The variety of food is abundant, the service is very good, everyone will greet you with a warm "Good morning" or a nice smile. This is an exceptional place to eat I would thoroughly recommend breakfast here

This is the famous chief's restaurant. Only hotel guests are able to have a breakfast there. The price is S$43 per person (not including tax). Not many people know that we can have breakfast there because the hotel plans with breakfast are only restaurants at 1F. This is the secret place:)If you come early time (open 7:00-),you can get a good view table

The breakfast here at Spago is fantastic, but a little on the expensive side at $50 for a self service buffet.On the positive side, the coffee is great, which is generally a massive challenge in Singapore.The restaurant overlooks the pool on the roof of The Marina Bay Sans, it is open air, so can feel hot as there's no air con
