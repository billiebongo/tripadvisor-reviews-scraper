Obviously expensive, the rent must be exorbitant but the food was deliciously tasty.
We had Buta Don, FOC Gyoza and two Shiro Specials, great ambience with enthusiastic service.
The three adults loved it and so did my grand daughter!

It's a restaurant part of a chain.It's a really nice place with a beautiful atmosphere and the particular Japanese way to welcome and serve the clients.Food's really good and you can choose through a large variety or ramen but not only.It was my favourite in Singapore. If you like ramen, this is a good choice

Dined at this ramen restaurant for the first time in Singapore even though I've tried their outlets in Japan before. Service was very good as all staff were very friendly and attentive. Taste is as close as it could get to the original ones found in Japan. Love how the soup has slices of yuzu to add that little citrus zest to the flavour. Like it too that you can choose the doneness of the noodles.Ippudo always commands a long queue line, so be sure to go early or be ready to wait a while in the queue.Definitely a satisfying ramen meal!

The most expensive Ramen I have ever had for the same level of ramen restaurant i had visited. And for that level of service / type of resto, they should not have added 10 percent service charge on top of the high price Ramen they already sell in the resto. Ramen is my second favourite dishes after chinese food and i know how the ramen price should be and the it is away more expensive than Macau and Tokyo. ( I can not compare with Indonesian even I came from Indonesia ) Over all, The Taste of the Ramen good and is consistant with other ippudo.

Not sure why . But this outlet’s price tag for ramen is more than the rest of its outlets in singapore. Location and rent Marina bay sands could be the reason . Anyway i ordered the ramen and taste was consistent. But for this price it felt hefty for just a bowl of simple noodle

I love to try remen everywhere i go and one of the few places where you can get original Japanese ramen is Ippudo. Strong flavors, perfect - this is the ramen at Ippudo!!!!!Friendly staff, they very fast at times.Must try : Chuka Soba, Spicy Black, Tsukemen, Akamaru Shinaji ..

Dined there on 17th August 2017. I am a fan of Ippudo particularly at the Mandarin Gallery outlet. Where the standards have remained consistent since opening. But following my meal at the MBS complex, I felt rather disappointed. The soup stock was well seasoned but had no X factor. The fatty pork loin was over cooked. A key ingredient.The only redeeming grace; the service was excellent. The waitress even offered to crush our fresh garlic for us. Very impressed !!Alan LeongSingapore

The ramen here was nice.... but I'm not sure any ramen in a ramen house is S$18 for a basic bowl, type of nice. I know Singapore is expensive, but when you look at the comparison of the hawker style eateries that are able to serve you up a meal for around S$5-6, paying this kind of money for a bowl of noodles is a little rich. Great that you can choose how hard or soft you'd like your ramen, and I will admit, it did make my ramen yummy, but definitely still baulking at the price point. Especially considering that a bowl of ramen in Japan goes for around AUD$10 or cheaper, and I use to go to an amazing ramen place in Korea that made fresh ramen on site for AUD$7 a bowl. Even in Australia I paid AUD$12 in Perth (one of the more expensive cities for food). I know, it's in the Marina Bay district but it is still a restaurant just off to the side of a shopping centre food court. I'd only recommend this place if you were in the centre and craving ramen, which was the position I found myself in

We were really surprised that the Japanese restaurant facing the ice skating rink in Marina Bay Sands could serve you within 10 ,minutes. That is really efficient without waiting long. The staff was also good at service, attentive and you don't need to wait long for payment of Bill.It was just after the National Day rehearsal but the crowd handling was excellent.Really ordered ramen noodles, some add ones, they were delicious without high prices.I would recommend you this restaurant

Ippudo served a good bowl of japanese ramen and its located strategicly next to rasapura masters foodcourt. the ramen is quite good but the pork pao is not good

Was queueing for our turn for this Ramen stall and realized that the restaurant is famous in Osaka.
Ordered two kind of broth ramen, gyoza ans the octopus ball. All were delicious. Superb good food. However, it is better in Osaka I believe.

Had chicken ramen here and it was really good. They also have other dishes that taste good. Would go again.

One of the best and authentic Ramen in Singapore! Im in love with the pork broth and is so rich and flavourful!

The ramen was wonderfully delicious. You can choose the hardness of your cooked ramen. The karaage chicken is to dead for. Service was all right but can be better.

The broth wasn't as rich as I'd like and the chashu was chewy. Otherwise good and the gyoza was the perfect texture, some of the best I've had. The staff had been trained to shout like Japanese ramen restaurant staff but didn't have the Japanese service attitude - very hard to get their attention even when they walk right past you, and the ramen takes 20 minutes to serve even when the place is quiet. And they charge up to $25 for a ramen with the works yet it's no better than a $15 ramen at Liang Court

The Ippudo Marina Bay Sands restaurant has recently been opened and is located adjacent to the roller skating rink in B2 at Marina Bay Shoppes.Had lunch here today with my local friend who works nearby.It is neat and tidy, the décor is fresh with a real Asian feel - the menu has both sets and individual dishes to order. Staff were friendly and helpful explaining dishes when queried.For entrée we had Goyza's and Takoyaki followed by Unagi Don & Shiro Tamago as mains - we shared all dishes and were certainly satisfied.My friend wandered off to work afterwards...I think she enjoyed the meal as did I.If you want something different give this place a go when visiting Marina Bay Shoppes. - recommended

This is my 2nd visit for dinner. Consistent quality, does not disappoint ; Value for money. Costs about S$25/pax. Tea is approx S$6.00 per pot for 1pax. Friendly and cheerful service. Has counter bar seats for single visitors.Wish they had brown rice roasted tea as their roasted tea tasted more like Jasmine tea.Spacious setting. Free water!!

Well, I'm only going to Japan in June this year, hence I cannot compare in terms of authenticity. But honestly, it's one of the best that I have tried before in Singapore. They allow you to choose the type of noodles - soft medium hard. The soup broth is just DAEBAK!! (Very good in Korean). Though it's a little pricey for me, but it will be a place where I will come again when I want to give myself a treat

This is a quick service concept by IPPUDO, the famous ramen brand. They only offered chicken paitan soup base here, but the standard is as good as IPPUDO's usual offerings.Recommend to try their signature Kuro-Obi which comes with an umami egg and 3 pcs of chicken chashu - it's only at $12! Great dining option when you are in MBS.
