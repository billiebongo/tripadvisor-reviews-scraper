This wonderful teashop near the Singapore Art Museum is off the beaten track. Staff helpful and friendly. Enjoyed the cakes and tea/coffee. Hope to be back again soon. Good luck and enjoy!

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted with rows of bread, individual pieces and loaves. Down the counter to the left is the place to order lunch sets from a limited menu, including chicken karaage burgers and chicken stew. The sets are very tasty Japanese versions of European dishes and come with coffee or tea. Each set was about SGD 15. The bread here is so good! Try whatever flavors they have that day and take some home

We were extremely pleased with the array of pastries and sweet things to eat. Service with a smile, great staff. Recommend eating the Cruffin, just like a Danish on steriods. What a feast absolutely great, I enjoyed it some much I returned the next day for another bout. Just loved it. The coffee was great but was overshadowed by the orange juice. An excellent place to relax and enjoy excellent food

Feels like a food court or staff canteen with high price food. Cheese bread 3 slices $4.50. Apparently it’s a special Japanese recipe but too expensive. Bacon epic (wonder if it’s that epic) $2.50 a small piece. Bacon & cheese fried donut small piece $2.80. It didn’t taste freshly fried and was oily even though there was substantial amount of cream cheese filling. White toast $3.90. Sandwiches on promotion from $4.50. Tan Chong Motors staff have some good discounts but public have none even though it’s close to closing time. I wonder what they do with done much bread left. Would I be back? No. Average taste and expensive price.

We came here as part of a food trail, so we only got to sample 2 buns: one tasted like it had a crunchy melon crust, and another which had ham and melted cheese inside. Both tasted really nice, but were quite expensive too. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and would probably make for a good study/chilling spot

Asanoya is a bright, spacious and relaxing cafe with clean restrooms. It offers a variety of yummy bread products and a small selection of cakes e.g. yuzu cheese cake. In addition, there are hot breakfast sets as well as lunch sets besides cold sandwiches and potato salad. Even my very fussy mum loves their bread - chocolate bread, raisin bread, various tea breads - orange, blueberry, yuzu. My favourite items include the beef stew, curry donut, an pan, potato salad and cold sandwiches.What's great about Asanoya, is despite the extensive range of very good products, they continuously create seasonal specials and new products. There's never a dull moment for Asanoya fans like me!Staff are cheerful, helpful and usually efficient. However, when they put on new or casual staff, things may get a bit disorganised and service is a bit slow. Anyway, it's not a big problem as they usually have good supervisors and/or senior staff to ameliorate things

Asanoya Boulangerie is a great bakery with a broad range of bread, cakes and meals. Their cheese and bacon croissants are excellent but I found their lasagne toast something to die for. The staff are very friendly whilst the seating area is so clean, hygienic, spacious and well lit. The location is very central if you are having a day in the Bugis or City Hall area

I love the cinnamon bagel, and the turtle bread is soooo cute! There are some many different choices which can satisfy all your fantasies about breads. The coffee is also nice.I enjoyed watching the chef focused on his work on hand with a strong sense of dedication
4
Despite being located at a side road, the bakery and cafe boasts of a good crowd which is a testament to the popularity of their confectionery. Clean, light and airy, the place is good for small families and the working crowd for a quick breakfast or leisurely lunch.

Great Accessibility: Near CC2 Bras Basah MRT Exit A & 5 mins walk from Bugis+; paid parking lots available right at its door stepGreat Ambience: Excellent for those who seek serenity within this busy part of townGreat Taste: Perhaps the best Cheese Tart (SGD3 each, Buy 5 Get 1 Free), dined-in & the staff kindly offered to warm up the tart; Ice Lemon Tea ($4.20) is brewed daily & gave a nice hint of floral flavourGood to Note: help yourself to water at their cutlery/ pantry are

Popped in here for a quick lunch and coffee as the nearby eating places were so crowded. The food was not too bad. The coffee is good.
3
Ambience is nice and place is very spacious. Is good for small group of meeting and high tea. However, the cakes are not as good as what I thought of. The swiss rolls are too sweet which destroys the taste.

This cafe took over the premises of a Chinese seafood restaurant. Nice cosy place - offering another choice for a break after a visit to the nearby Singapore Art Museum (SAM@Q).

Asanoya Boulangerie certainly is a wholesome bakery. Their range of bread, cakes and meals is incredible; certainly out of range of your usual bakery. They recently opened 2 outlets in Central Orchard area and in the heartlands. Main store on Queen Street have lunch time and tea sets in their large spacious premises. All meals are freshly prepared at affordable prices.

We love this japanese named western bakery which is situated near to two catholic churches.Staff greet you when you enter the bakery and then leave you alone to decide on your choice or pastry or pasta. Pleasant place to be, near Bugis, if you need a place to rest your weary legs and enjoy a cuppa java after many hours of shopping

I like the matcha salted egg croissant. I went home and heated the croissant. So the goey part was nice and warm when you bite into the croissant and it gushes out. It can get messy! Be prepared. I like the cheesy tart. The filing is creamy and yet still quite light. I will probably go back and try their cafe / sandwich menu

Came across this cafe accidentally after departing from Singapore Design Centre. It's at the back alley. Was there on a Saturday & was surprised to see the place so pack in spite of the location. We ordered a variety of bread to share. The one that stand out the most is their Hokkaido cheese tart. The pastry price are a bit steep but they make up for their quality. Overall, a great tea n pastry session for family & friends.
3
With the cost of a bread set meal (a drink, a soup and a croissant set meal) going at SGD13 average, I think the whole experience is just so-so. Nothing much to laud about. Selection wise is okay, but honestly, I would not make a deliberate trip back for anything. Only if I happen to be passing by, and don't mind wasting some cash on an average meal
3
I chanced upon this cafe one Sunday morning and decided to have a go on their bakery. I have their maple walnut pretzel ($4.50) which is one of their popular items. I like the taste of the walnut with maple syrup but it will be prefect if the pretzel is less dense
3
Visited this place for a mid morning coffee and pastry. It's a bit off the 'beaten track' but not too far from Bugis. They have located in a large ground floor area which is decked out Japanese style. As for the coffee and food I thought it was very average. Service was ok although I got the feeling that staff were not trained too well. Prices were also a little expensive. To be honest there are better choices around that area.

Nice food and French pastries in the heart of Singapore. Good service and clean premises, close to Royal Hotel at queens where we stayed

especially when your hotel is next door. What a wonderful variety of bread and pastry confection for the connoisseur or anybody.

Read a lot about this place and many claimed it tastes so good. Abit of French Japan bakery in Singapore. Went with my mum to try. We ordered the promotional high tea set - a green tea Hokkaido cream matcha roll with peach Danish, and coffee. At offer price $8.20The charcoal roasted coffee was quite tasty. But would I pay for it? No. Together with the tea set? Ok. It wasn't so superb that I would fork out money for it. The Danish? Quite hard and dry. Chewy texture. No buttery fragrance. Nothing spectacular. Perhaps even genetic delifrance is better. The cake roll was soft and moist but a tad bit sweet. It wasn't bad but nothing great. It's not like it's a MUST to travel there to dine. There's plenty of Japanese style bakeries around. The usual price for the roll at $2.80 and Danish (I think over $3), not worth the effort. Not much service either. Not enough staff to clear tables after diners leave. The sugar and creamer baskets were not refilled. Too much hype for average food and service. I won't be back. Nothing to draw me there. Abit out of the way too. Beside st. Joseph's church beside the mortuary!

Probably one of the lesser known cafes in town. The bakery looks airy due to the high ceilings, glass facade and the ample space between tables. I was there for lunch and they had a set meal with soup and drink at about $14, which is reasonably priced. Not the first time there as I was there about 2 weeks earlier with my wife for some after-lunch desserts. The ice-chocolate with ice cream topping was top-notch I would say, and I really love the matcha with azuki swiss roll, not too creamy but just sweet enough for the taste buds. Would be a comfortable place to sit-down for an afternoon cuppa with a few friends. and yes, this is a bakery. The prices are a little steep compared to the neighbourhood bakeries though, but expect quality from their bread and pastries as well

A gem find in the Bras Basah area especially if you are attending the arts/museum events in the evenings. It has a spacious dine-in area for you to chill for tea or supper. There is a wide spread of breads to compliment your tea or coffee. I had the Tea bread which is flavoured with green tea leaves and condensed milk. The staff are polite and know their products. Great and friendly service! There is also a gourmet shop which sells jam spreads and dips

Went on a sat afternoon and it wasn't crowded. The place is big, clean and bright. The aircon was cooling for a really hot afternoon. Ordered the yuzu cheese cake ($5) and matcha azuki Swiss roll ($2.80). Both were delicious. Also ordered a white coffee ($5) and a Snapple drink ($3.60).Very nice place to relax in.

Came here for a late lunch/tea on a Saturday afternoon with my bestie. Asanoya is located on Queen Street, but away from the hustle and bustle that is Bugis area, yet within walking distance. The place is bright and airy, great for chilling out from the heat. Between the 2 of us, we tried 6 different items. Standouts are the tiramisu, yuzu cream cheese cube, with copious amount of filling which literally oozed out as you cut into the bread. The maple walnut pretzel is a best seller, but we found it could be softer. This place is also family friendly as the tables are not too close together so you can push your pram through, and there were several high chairs available (and they were clean). Service is friendly and very efficient. Will return again to try the other items

Everything is super fresh and looks good enough to wear!

Unfortunately I just drop in for coffee and cake, and did not partake in any meal. The staff is very friendly and polite. The dining area is well lit and clean; the decor is all white, I feel that it could do with some colour. The prices are slightly on the high side

Dining here a few times in 2 days was probably one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore. The food was delicious and affordable. The place was so clean and modern. We're definitely going back, or we'll keep an eye out for it when we go to Japan
