Italian Restaurant by Indian Chef?
Food is ok but not any special...
Very expensive for what is served..
1
Dropped a glass of wine on my Wife and did not even apologise! Well if that is the level of service you expect feel free to go to this place! Never going back again!
5
As soon as you walk in here it smells like Italy! Lots of good choices on the menu, it was hard to choose! The food was delicious, the chef from Italy was excellent
5
Had 8 dishes over several days and all were perfect. Great friendly service in a good location. Well worth going to if I was in a different part of town,
5
Went here because it was only 200m from our hotel in bencoolen and wanted something not south east Asian for a night. Lovely thin pizzas with authentic toppings came quickly with Italian wines and beers as well as an off-the-menu simple pasta with tomato sauce for the kids (1 and 4).One of the best tiramisus I've had for a long time but only complaint was it was too small!Overall excellent experience and would recommend if you wanted something not local

My family & I wanted to have a last dinner in Singapore so we thought we would head to the Pizza place down the road. We were definitely under dressed however still went in. We were very surprised at the friendly welcome. The food was the best we have eaten! We have been to Italy & couldnâ€™t believe how delicious the meals were. I would highly recommend to eat here. Absolutely sensational.
5
Been here a couple of times in the past with my family and their standards have been fairly consistent. As for their service, the floor staff are all warm and accommodating.Attached with this review are the pictures of the food we ordered. Their Angel hair pasta, vongole and truffle parma ham pizza is a must try!

We basically drove passed the restaurant and I thought "this looks nice" what I did was to see their TripAdvisor ratings and decided to park nearby and dine there. There's a few things that comes with a dining experience.Hygiene 4/10As I arrived I quickly asked where the lavatory is and it was really shocking to find out that it is probably the worst restroom I have been in Singapore at this kind of restaurant. First of all, you must loop round the outside of the building to get there, second of all, it is not only small but the it is just so industrial looking with stainless steel sink that sounds loud and water splashing. Last but not least, just like most places in Singapore, it does not have papers or towels to dry your hand. I also found out that there's some disgustingly dried pasta still lingering on my fork but they quickly changed it.Having experienced all that I started to wonder if I have wasted a meal? But the food really made it up the whole way. Food and wine 10/10To me, it is not easy to find super authentic western food in Singapore esp pizza. This place have made it. They use the stone oven and the crust is nice and crisp and the pasta is even better. we ordered a Frutti de Mare and it was YUM! It is just like what you would taste in Italy. They also use the very homey looking Italian style plates and that certainly adds to it.Even though I did not order wine, I have had a look at the wine list and they carry a good enough range from the standard cheap Italian that can be bought by glass to a half bottle and the premium range of Sassicaia and Antinori and the price is acceptable as well. Price 8/10It is what you would expect from the settings. The bills comes at SGD 95.93 for two people after GST and service. I find the pricing a bit awkward though as the main is so expensive in comparison.Starter (Burata) 22.80Main (Pizza Margherita 23.00)Main (Seafood Spagetti 23.90)Dessert (Profiterols 11.80)Service 8/10Good service in general but I have noticed a few things:1) no bread... that hurts as I would expect all Italian restaurant to serve fresh bread before the meal without saying.2) they never asked but served both the starter and the main at the same time. I ordered dessert as we are finishing and they do ask if dessert can come straight away or afterwards. Parking 4/10Even though the building it is in is very nice and reminded me of the Raffles Hotel, they DO NOT have parking. The nearest parking will still be more than 5 mins walk away and not the most convenient one to pick up your cars at as you'll need to walk into something that looks like a back alley and took us a whole to figure out where the lift lobby is.SummaryFood was amazing and as authentic as it gets. The price is reasonable overall but for some reason, starters are very expensive. If you do mind about the restroom or the ease of parking this probably won't be the place for you. The wine list is good enough and price is reasonable too. I personally will definitely go back again

We went here for an evening meal. We highly recommend it as the service was great and the food was very good. We started with the bruschetta that had fresh tomato. For mains my partner had the Margarita Pizza and I had the Penne with Bacon and Mushroom which both were vey nice and reasonably priced. It is in a very good location opposite Bras Basah MRT
3
This restaurant came highly recommended by locals but for someone that lives in NYC where there's an abundance of excellent Italian restaurants, this restaurant unfortunately was just okay. Went there with a large group. Tried traditional dishes which like pizza, bruchetta, fried calamari, pasta with white clam sauce, and spagetti & meatballs in a red sauce. Food proportions are on the smaller side. No complaints about the service which was attentive
5
The restaurant is located in the Singapore art museum. It’s a typical trattoria but the food is superb. The wines are great and the service too. I thoroughly enjoyed a long lazy afternoon
5
Wonderful authentic Italian, great service, they really looked after us extremely well and as the title says the best caeser salad I've had! to quote my mother in law Barbra.
5
I can strongly recommend this restaurant for the great and authentic Italian food.
Excellent pasta, prosciutto, mozzarella cheese, pizza and meat.
We also tried a very good Amarone Wine....
The place is near Bras Basah and City Hall MRT.
The staff is very professional too.
5
Came with spouse for an evening of italian dinner, ordered the bruschetta, two pasta dishes, wine and tiramisu. All were good and seasoning was spot on. Some italian places are more heavy on seasoning, but we find this place was easy and nice in this aspect. Recommended if you are in the mood for italian! The murals on the walls are nice touches, and overall a pleasure to be here

I have been a couple of times and I have never been disappointed - it's like an Italian family restaurant, not too big, a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I had a very good risotto with porcini mushrooms, just the right creamy consistency. I was offered bruschetta on the house, nicely prepared with toppings full of flavour. The service was friendly and I am looking forward to my next visit
2
We live only walking distance from this restaurant, and had been looking forward to trying it for the first time.I like the decor and ambience, and I liked the range of the menu. The clams for starter were a big portion and we shared them, and were good. Unfortunately we both found our mains (carbonara and pork medallions) unpleasantly over salty. I mean badly over salted. For this reason alone we agreed we wouldn't return
4
Visited the restaurant on a Sunday night. The restaurant wasn't really crowded when we arrived but reservations should be made in order to avoid disappointments. Service was prompt and menus were handed out quickly. Level of attention to detail remained constant throughout our dinner.For starters we had the burrata and cold cut meats. It's really hard to screw dishes like these up and the thinly sliced cured meat was really flavorful but not too salty. The fried calamari, fish and prawns were we ordered were well cooked. With the fish and prawn cooked to just the right doneness and the calamari not being too tough.Moving on to mains, a pizza, lamb main, the sea bass, carbonara and ribeye steaks were ordered. The portions were hearty and all the components of the dishes were well cooked.Having been here many times, this is the first time I'm leaving a review because the food and overall service was consistently good throughout all my visits here with my family.

Located in the Singapore Art Museum along Bras Basah Road, over looking the Singapore Management University. The serving size is more than the typical restaurant in Singapore. Food are quite good. The crispy bread served are very light & tasty. The tomato based pasta I had was steaming hot, but taste average. But all other dishes we ordered were good, especially the tiramisu & chocolate ice cream. We were served some pretty good shot of liquor on the house.The staffs here are very friendly & helpful. One of them walked with us outside the restaurant & showed us the better place to catch the taxi.
4
The minute you enter the restaurant, one can smell the pizza in the grill. So good. Immediately felt hungry. Service was excellent and the waitress should be commended - pushing us in and remembering us. Menu was very traditional - none of the new age items in other Italian restaurants. Best dish of the house without doubt is the seafood risotto. Excellent. Other dishes were good but could keep eating the risotto non-stop!
5
There are very few times in Singapore when you can combine great food and service consistently. I've been to this restaurant four times in the last year and we can always guarantee a relaxing and delicious meal. It's our go to authentic Italian meal. When we splurge for the bottle of wine, it actually tastes good (a rarity in SG Italian restaurants). We like to sit by the window. It's a great date night
4
Three of us dinner there for dinner and enjoyed the decor, food and service. We would dine there again.
5
If you do you would like to have a delicious Italian pizza in Singapore this is the place for you. This is a great place for Italian food in a tavern setting, It reminds me of a restaurant that your Italian cousin would own.
5
I came here for lunch with my 4yo daughter. We loved it. I literally made a reservation to come back with my wife on the spot. Try the Limonata liqueur. Very nice with their apple tart desert.
4
This is a great restaurant - and one my kids really enjoy eating at. Food is always good and the service on point. No overly pretentious - but too casual. Good location near the MRT.
5
I've frequented this trattoria since it's Prinsep Street days. The food is always excellent and easily the best Italian comfort food in Singapore. Nothing pretentious.... just well cooked and with generous portions.
5
Am so impressed with the service that I just have to give a review even though I have yet to enjoy a meal. We passed by the restaurant and decided to pop in for a drink. Ordered a limoncello and a bottle of still water. Accidentally spilled the limoncello so ordered another one. Though we just ordered drinks, the service staff served us complimentary bruschetta taster. They were delicious and well presented, bread was right texture and the blend of tomatoes/ flavoring was well balanced. And when we settled the bill, the restaurant only billed us for one limoncello. Will certainly be back for a meal. Love it when a restaurant place service as a priority.
5
On each visit to Singapore we make a point of eating here and each time it seems to get better if that is possible. The food and service are excellent and whilst slightly expensive this is justified by the quality of the food. Staff seemed to hover a little too much but better this than being ignored if we required something. A good range of authentic Italian dishes and well worth a visit
4
Had lunch with my girlfriend. We had ordered baby clams, salami pizza and red wine. Love the selection of wines. The pizza was great with the crispy crust. The clams were fresh too. The location is within walking distance from Bras Basah station, around 5 minutes. The service crew was good, attentive in their services. I think the experience will be excellent if the crew bothers to smile.
5
I love this restaurant! The food is delicious! On the two times I visited this trip I had the lasagna and cannelloni. Both were very good, as was the caesar salad. Along with your meal the waitstaff will bring you a crispy, warm flatbread seasoned with garlic and butter. Delicious! The wine is quite nice as well. Highly recommended
4
Ate once in December, and another time in January, after visiting artwork at the nearby Singapore Art Museum. The Caesar Salad with Salmon, the Vongole and the Tortellini were good choices. Service in the restaurant was friendly, but undermanned (or otherwise, not very well trained because the restaurant was not even half-full around 1:30pm). Sincerely hope that service improves in this quaint restaurant
1
Refused a table indoor, the owner shockingly aggressive and rude. His own staff later confessed he is racist to locals! Never had such treatment by any restaurant in Singapore.
4
We had tortelloni and cannelloni. Both straight from the oven, and delicious. Service was not particularly friendly, but satisfactory.
5
If you are looking for a really nice place to dine then the Trattoria Lafiandra would be a good choice. The food was excellent with a main course costing between $30-$35. The service was both efficient and friendly. I would highly recommend it.
5
Chef Cataldo its the best in town for authentic southern italian food.
Try the tagliatelle della nonna.
5
We tried almost everything on the menu so far and in all our visits it never disappointed us. The service is really friendly, the chef makes every dish to perfection and you simply cannot stop eating as it's all too good. It's always clear they use the best Italian imported and fresh local ingredients and when you pair this with clear passion for food that the chef displays - you get an awesome meal each and every time!
5
Had a wonderful dinner and the food was better than I could have imagined. The starters were out of this world; the calamari and bruschetta were awesome. The pizzas were divine. We could do half and half. They were accommodating to our preferences. Pastas were divine too. Must try; carbonara and lasagna ❤
4
The food was very good, tasty and proper italian. The service needs to improve, we were 3 people and the three dishes came in different times, and the focaccia (starter) came together with the last dish. Although this, I must say the food was very good
5
Hidden away in the Singapore Art Museum, Trattoria Lafiandra is a great lunch or dinner venue in the Bras Basah area of town. Great pizzas and a wide range of Italian cuisine to suit all the family. Ravioli to die for and superb fish.Family and authentic Italian run by chef Cataldo Lafiandra.Worth a visit
5
We stumbled upon this little Italian restaurant after visiting the art museum. It was really nice inside, the service was outstanding from the moment we arrived, the smell of the food was mouth watering. My girlfriend ordered the seafood pasta and I had the lasagna, and garlic pizza for entrée. Best was the tiramisu for dessert, omggggg wowwwww this place is absolutely yummoooooo
5
A great place to come for authentic Italian food. We visit each time we come to Singapore. There is always a warm welcome, the staff are attentive, efficient and friendly. The menu is extensive with mainly but not exclusively Italian dishes. The place has a good atmosphere, the tables not too close together and there are frescos adorning the walls with views of Italian landscapes. The food is always delicious. We look forward to our next visit
5
A piece of Toscanny in Singapore. Good Valpollicella house wine in caraf. Good atmosphere and great hospitality.
5
We like Italian food and the restaurant is probably the best in Singapore. The menu is extensive, the food very good and the staff polite and friendly.
4
Great atmosphere and real Italian cuisine in this restaurant located near SAM museum. Will recommend for a casual lunch or business lunch! I ordered a pizza which was good size (too much for me actually) and a tiramisu which I found very good too.
5
Relaxed atomosphere and authentic Italian cuisine. Variety of menu from antipasti to dolci will certainly make both lunch and dinner joyful. Especially the pasta is lovely tasty with perfect al dente.
The matching of panna cotta with wild fruit source is next to none.
5
This is a very nice Italion restaurant and the food is excellent with friendly staff who speak good English
4
Pizza's was excellent and very tasty, we recommend this place if want eat pizza.Atmosphere was nice, when we stay there same time there is 3 Italian groups so have little noisy but it's nice, Italian style.Place look nice and clean, staff was nice and food come fast
5
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. I ran along the street and found this place is very cozy. Then I had a chance to have my first dinner there with my friend. It was very friendly environment. The people there are happy about their jobs and good knowledge for pairing the wine. I was surprised to see the bill though.. it's much cheaper than most fine restaurants in Singapore. I continued to Trattoria Lafiandra several times and never disappointed. Strongly recommend to anyone
1
Poor service. Very rude owner/manager.My husband and I went to this place searching for a good pizza. Even though the service was not so good we liked the pizza and we went back there some timesLast time we took a friend there to show her the place. We ordered two pizzas and tap water. The staff visibly didn't like the fact we didn't order any drinks, desert or coffee because different people kept coming and making sure we didn't want something else before actually bringing the tap water or the bill. We asked for the bill and requested to take away the left overs. When this guy, who we assumed was the owner, brought the bill he complained yelling "three people, two pizzas".We couldn't believe in what we just had heard so we thought we didn't understand, but when we were saying thank you as we were making our way out, the owner kept yelling "three people, two pizza" and was moving his hand like showing the exit and literally expelling us from the place.My husband stopped to talk to the owner but he just repeated "three people, two pizzas" and said out loud the amount of our bill. My husband tried to understand the reason of such behaviour but the owner didn't listen and just touched my husband's shoulder telling him to leave.We were never was so badly treated. We found it really rude and we are not ever going back there

Reviews for this place has been good and I shall confirm its really good!It's the best mushroom risotto ever!Premium ingredients, great taste! The first mouthful got me all excited because it's so flavourful. Maybe they added loads of truffle oil.. Our food came piping hot, I mean really emitting lots of steam. And towards the end, my risotto is still warm. How awesome! I'm so full but I still want to finish every grain. We had the eggplant with cheese and tomato as starter, the cheese is solid, chewy, the dish is also one of the better ones we had. The place is very accessible by train (beside bras basah), and by car (park at Manulife). A full fledge Italian restaurant located in a old prewar building.. This setting is somewhat similar to a typical trattoria in Italy. Surely.. Awesome place and food, reasonable pricing. We will be back to try the pizzas! We saw a guy finish a salad and a whole pizza all by himself.. Must be really good

After visiting the National Museum of Singapore me and my family saw Trattoria Lafiandra which was just nearby. Initially there was no available table left inside the air conditioned area. So we waited outside while having some wine. After 20 minutes of wait we were ushered to our table which was located nicely at the center of the hall. For starters we got the "Selection of cold cuts and greens from the chef" and "a basket of Garlic pizza bread with rosemary and olive oil". Both were good. Each of us had different orders but the Osso Buco stood out for me.Really liked the service and ambiance of this Resto. No wonder it's full.
5
Tasteful and reasonably priced Italian in Singapore. Wonderful pastas and pizzas, great service.
Recommend, worth of every cent.
5
We love the location and ambience of this place. Last night's Ossobuco alla Milanese paired with Merlot and Pizza Capricciosa were delicious! Thanks for a another great experience! Next visit we'll try the Costolette d’Agnello al rosmarino :)
4
Tasteful Italian food with original Italian "homemade" twist. Great selection of wines. Friendly service. Good value for money.
5
We eat here two nights and loved every mouthful, lovely friendly service and a real Italian feel to the place.
5
Been here a few times but a year or so ago. Still as good and I believe they would have a very good base of regular customers. Excellent pastas and pizzas and other Italian dishes.
4
No visit to Singapore is complete without a trip here. Garlic bread is good. Pasta is good too. Go here and you won't regret it. Bit expensive but worth it. Cost around £25 each.
3
I had been invited to lunch here by a friend and had looked up the menu and read the tripadvisor reviews.As I arrived slightly late the basket of garlic bread had cooled but tasted ok.Next arrived a small plate with two tiny pieces of bruchetta on and two little piles of salad with I think a ham or salami,being vegetarian I tried the tomato bruchetta which was quite tasteless.We had a glass of the prossecco to acompany this which was well chilled and crisp.The staff are very friendly,efficient, attentive but non intrusive,they even asked if we would like to move as a large group came and was sitting just one table along from us.Our mains arrived, my pizza margherita was rather large,I had ordered it with chill, the chilli flakes arrived in a little pot.The pizza allthough thin was rather soggy and greasy,not crispy at all,the chilli flakes definately helped,but I still only ate half even though I was quite hungry.My friend had a baked pasta Tagliatelle alla Nona Teresa which was also quite a large portion,but was a bit on the dry side.We had a glass of very nice red wine to accompany this.We passed on dessert but did have coffee which was good.We were also given a complimentary shot of Limoncello which was a nice touch.The restaurant has a nice ambience a pleasant setting and is in a good spot,but the food did not live up to the hype and I have eaten much better Italian
5
My fiancÃ© and I have been visiting this restaurant about once a fortnight for the last year - it's become our regular when we feel like a nice hearty meal and a good bottle of wine. The service is very good, efficient and friendly.Everything we have ever eaten here has been great, we usually end up having pasta but the pizzas are also delicious, thin and crispy, the salads are fresh and the starters that we have tried are all great. We can't fault this place, every time we have a great meal and a great evening. It's not super cheap, but it is very reasonably priced for Singapore! We'll definitely miss this restaurant when we leave Singapore.
5
I have been there different times with friends and, every time I've loved it. Real Italian trattoria food, great taste in every dish, from the pizza bread to the pasta pesto with vongole, from the lamb chops to the fiorentina steak, the taste of the fish absolutely good, the desserts; we always enjoy this restaurant. Cataldo, the owner and cook, really knows is job. Very good restaurant

We live locally, have been in several times over the last year, the first handful of times we were extremely pleased, we really felt like we had found a great traditionalItalian that could be our local.We had an incident about 4 months ago, where we had a hair in one of the dishes, it's one of those things that can happen we understand, but weren't impressed at the way ur complaint was handled.This evening we have been in for dinner, my wife, 2 year old son, helper and Myself, I had a starter, melon and Parma ham (excellent) my wife and helper both had the lamb chops, which were also excellent, I shared with my son a pizza, every time we take him in he has a margarita with some garlic on, and that's what we asked for this evening, the pizza arrived and us a ridiculous amount of garlic on it, not only that the garlic was in large chunks that were hardly cooked therefore they were still hard and very salty and bitter.I asked to speak with the manager, after being asked what the problem was I informed that I felt there was an excessive amount of garlic on the pizza, making it salty, overpowering and also the fact it was so large it hadn't even cooked.Her response was, 'you asked for garlic, I will speak with the chef'The owner is an older Italian guy, who clearly has some good relationships with some of his older longer term regulars, but once again! Upon being informed of our complaint he came out to the front of house and well let's just say if looks could kill, but more to the point the way he looked us up and down and lack of any apology, I just felt to be to much.Iv lived in many city's across the world, we eat out 3to4 times a week, Iv never before been left feeling so unwelcome from a restaurant owner!To the point I have purposely signed up to tripadvisor to leave this review.I had really enjoyed the food here 95% of my visits, I would have rated it 8/10 for traditional Italian food.But after this evenings experience, I will never visit again and would not recommend it either, shame as its in a fantastic location
4
I don't normally like Italian food but my husband wanted to go there. So glad we did it was amazing. Enjoyed every mouthful. Highly recommend this restaurant .
5
Excellent authentic Italian restaurant visited on numerous occasions over the last four years, food is consistently good, staff friendly and helpful, not the cheapest but then Singapore is not cheap.
Would recommend it.
4
Was hosted to lunch here yesterday. Good ambience and friendly staff. There is a good menu with appetizers, meat and pastas. Desserts is also quite delicious.
5
Good Italian Resturant. Chef is Italian from Bari and that's says much.
Good food a bit expensive.
Parking in front of the Resturant just next to the entrance to the Singapore Art Museum.
Excellent service
5
First of all i went to Trattoria LaFiandra since day 1, therefore I have to like to come back.Since I'm Italian I think my judgement for Italian food is severe, at trattoria I found many great dishes that are even better than Italian restaurant in Italy.Nevertheless let's start point by point:1) Location: is located at the art museum of Singapore originally a National monument, what to say more?? Is a lovely place, really beautiful. But even grater is that you can park just in front of the restaurant. Really rare in Singapore.2) Restaurant: Inside the decoration is nice, clean and tidy with great paint of Italy in the wall. 3) Food: Many choices, mostly all dishes are good but i suggest to try the gnocchi (hand made), the cotoletta alla milanese and as starter the cold cut (frash burratina and nice parma ham are always available). Wine selection is really large and you can try some of the best Italian wine like Amarone, Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo etc..4) Service: is really attentive and professional, the chef is hyper and thats the way a chef should be.Price: Of course is not cheap but please do not expect to get a Ferrari at the price of a Toyota
5
The reviews on this are correct- this IS great Italian! It is in a unique setting - part of an older museum. Very charming. I would recommend the primavera pizza. I had this on two occasions. The pasta dishes were awesome as well. The wines are reasonable. The staff is very attentive. Everything was great
5
Our second visit to Trattoria Lafiandra whilst visiting Singapore. Loved it so much the first time there was no doubt we would try it againâ€¦YUM! A delicious meal in an authentic Italian Restaurant. Service, food & wine were all exceptional. Very good value for portion size (pasta) and house wine. Thank you, see you again soon
4
Our second time to this restaurant, and while the food was as good as we remembered, the service was too rushed. Caesar salad was great to start, but our pasta with crabmeat (which my wife loved) arrived even before we had finished the salad, with my pizza margharita (also excellent) not far behind. We didn't order any wine, and after our first visit learned the "would you like some sparkling water at exorbitant prices" trick (we brought our own water this time but found they would have served us a carafe of filtered water if requested). I can only guess that the rushed service was because we weren't ordering high ticket items like wine, mineral water, dessert, etc. So it was an excellent meal in record time, but made us feel like second class customers, which I suppose was true enough.
5
This was a delicious meal in a lovely restaurant. I asked the waiter for a recommendation, and he suggested the homemade lasagna. I'm glad I followed his suggestion, because this lasagna was melt in your mouth. I preceded this with a caesar salad and some of their warm bread. Delicious! There is also quite an extensive wine list; I had their house Pinot Grigio which was quite good. I enjoyed this dinner immensely. There were two large groups at the restaurant, but that did not affect the service, which was excellent. I look forward to returning again
2
After the success of the Dome I thought I'd try the equally charming mirror image.Oh what a shame. Room is great. Staff are not. Food is poor. Calamaris tasted frozen. Pasta dish overcooked. Wine expensive. I know, I know ... it's Singapore - if you want Italian go to Italy... but sometimes, you can have too much rice. I'd walk past this and try the Dome
4
One of the most authentic Italian food experience in Singapore. Both the food as well as deserts were a great tasting delight. Recommended for vegetarians. The best part is the location as it is situated in the same building as Singapore Art Museum.
4
Enjoyed our evening with friends at the Trattoria Lafiandra, being a large group we tried a lot of dishes and no one was disappointed
Good atmosphere, the wine flowed well and we came away feeling we had received good value
4
We were recommended to this restaurant by a client and were not disappointed. Excellent food at reasonable prices and centrally located. Friendly and prompt service. Reservation recommended for dinner.
5
on our thrice yearly visits to Singapore, my wife and I and our son always have dinner at this excellent and friendly restaurant. The service is prompt and attentive by most friendly staff. On all occasions the food has been excellent and authentic Italian. The wine list, whilst not exhaustive, is good and not over-priced. We shall continue to visit the restaurant on our future visits
2
I visited Trattoria Lafiandra looking forward to good authentic Italian food.WOW was I disappointed!I came today around 12:00 and the place was mostly empty.I was greated by a friendly waitress and shown a table.Another waitress, not so friendly, took my order. Why do they keep her around?I ordered the involintini with eggpland and mozzarella. I am not sure whether the food was microwaved but this is the first time I received this dish with all the mozzarella in chunks and not melted. That was a disappointment getting cold mozzarella in a hot dish.The taste was bland bland bland.Later I received a few small pieces of toast as compliments of the house.The waitress said they do not have ice water but later another waitress brought a carraf of cold water to an adjacent table. I assume she just wanted me to order the expensive drinks on the menu.I also ordered a pizza .For some unexplicable reason it arrived 15 minutes after I finished my appetizer. other table receive the food but my pizza was nowhere to be found.I received a nice size pizza BUTAgain bland bland bland blandThe olives were of low quality although I paid 24.50 ++.What's with this bland food? does the chef not taste the food?I paid 50$ for two dishes....wow so expensive for this bland tasteless food.What a shame....I will skip this place

4 of us visited the restaurant on a Saturday night. It was quite busy, which is usually a good sign. They have a quite extensive menu with lots of Italian favourite dishes. Plenty on choice of pasta and pizza and a good range of meat and fish dishes. We enjoyed a bottle of Chianti, which at SGD98 is a bit pricey, but it was very good. " of our party started with a salad of tomato and mozzarella cheese, 1 had the fried calamari and I opted for the melon and Parma ham. There were 4 empty plates. For mains 1 of us tried a ravioli with mushrooms, 1 a Daviola pizza and I had an escalope of pork alla Milanese. It was a very generous size, as were all the dishes in my escalope was so large I couldn't finish it which is very usual for me. After a break 3 of us had the vanilla ice cream and 1 had the tiramisu. At the end of the meal we were offered a complimentary Grappa or Limoncello. The service was attentive but not intrusive. It can be quite expensive but f you choose from the menu wisely and maybe not have 3 courses it can be reasonably affordable. The table decor is covered chequered table cloths which is very in keeping with the style of Trattoria. As one might say very Italian but that is what it is and it works well. It may not be cheapest you can find in Singapore but if you go I am sure you will enjoy the experience
4
Ordered pizza (salami, olive, artichoke, mushroom) and pasta (crabmeat) for our mains. Pizza melts in your mouth with good flavour. Pasta is nice but not extra special. Caesar salad was delicious - nice amount of sauce and fresh crisp lettuce. Topping all off with old favourite tiramisu. Solid italian feed that we will keep coming back. A little pricey though - but you'll expect that with the location.
5
This place isn't cheap but this is Singapore and nothing is cheap here. The food was excellent, the wine was not too outrageous (we paid one third more for the same quality wine in an Italian restaurant in the raffles center) and the pasta and desert were outstanding. The wait staff were friendly and very competent (unlike the staff at the previously mentioned Italian restaurant in the raffles center who were straight off the street). In a very expensive city don't let the prices of this place put you off. For Italian food it's quite reasonable. Doubly so when you consider the quality of the food :) The desert was excellent. Portions not too large. Best meal in Singapore so far.

I hosted a group of six for a team-building function at the Trattoria LaFiandra. We were seated quickly, and the service was very attentive throughout the evening. Also, the food was very good, but the prices have noticeably increased since our last gathering at this restaurant. As the restaurant filled with people, the acoustics made it difficult to converse with other the person immediately adjacent (some sound absorbing material on the ceilings/walls might help enhance the atmosphere during peak dining periods)
3
Was here on a date with my wife. Service was good. Decor felt like i was on a fake stage set in those poorly painted back drops of Italian country side/decor.Food was ok, but nothing stood out to make this Italian resto be one of the best in Singapore. I was expecting a little more considering the prices
5
Lovely fresh cuisine, nicely prepared, excellent service, reasonable priced by Singapore standards. Really nice to find a small intimate Italian restaurant keeping to its true values. Highly recommended
5
Great ingredients (e.g. burata, prosciutto) that make dishes taste properly. Never struggled to get a table.
5
We have become regulars at this restaurant because of their delicious, traditional, home-cooked food which is well-priced. The staff are all very friendly. I can highly recommend the lasagne with a nice glass of red wine!
3
Ordered egglant roll, highly recommended by the owner. But nothing to shout about. The only brillian stuff is garlic bread. Ordered four maincourse; lemon fish, parma ham, baked chicken and ravioli. All average except fish, average good....
5
Looking for a meal after a long journey we didn't stray far from the hotel. An Italian restaurant ( which are plentiful around the world) that had a great atmosphere. It felt very cosy inside and the staff were very attentive without being intrusive. We had veal and a seafood marinara as main course. We shared a bottle of Chianti to relax ourselves
2
My first experience with Trattoria Lafiandra left a bad taste and I would find it hard to be convinced to give it a second chance. I found the place to be disingenuous and cunning. In ordering the tagliatelle salmon with Gorgonzola I specifically asked if they had Gorgonzola or if they used Blue Cheese upon which I was presented a good sized sample of the Gorgonzola to be used. What happened when delivered the main course was that I was presented a tagliatelle salmon carbonara overflowing in a white sauce with absolutely no trace of the Gorgonzola either in taste, smell or in color! Putting this to the attention of the staff, we were then given crisp bread with the very same Gorgonzola as "compensation" which we politely declined.When paying the bill we noticed that two items "given as a complementary" once we sat down at our table - and not ordered - were added on to the bill. This was also pointed out and eventually removed from the tab.The only reason I give this a two star is that the rolled eggplant dish for starters were acceptable - otherwise - give this place a miss - there are plenty of Italian food outlets in Singapore much more desirable than this disingenuous place
5
After eating a steady diet of Asian food, this restaurant provided a delicious change of pace. Located in the same building as the Singapore Art Museum, it is a lovely spot with tables both inside and out. The wine selection is very good, but take note that the pours are not very generous. The wait staff was helpful with suggestions and continually attentive. Your meal will begin with warm, thin bread--most delicious. You'll need a little time to get through the menu. It is varied and extensive. I ordered the pasta with shrimp and zucchini and enjoyed it very much. All in all this was a delightful, relaxing meal
4
Stumbled across on the way back to the hotel. Glad we did! Friendly service, comfortable room to dine in with fresh warm thin bread served, a delicious insalata mista and absolutely perfect spaghetti arrabiata. Wine was flavourful and overall, for Singapore, reasonably priced. Would go back in a second. Food was freshly prepared to order and delicious
5
Love this Italian. Been there over 5 times in a few years. It's got great food, good service and won't cost a bomb either. Bit hard to find but once we tried it then it became our favourite. Tonight we had garlic bread, gorgeous. Calamari. Minestrone soup. Ravioli and tagliatelle. Just divine we will be back one day. 2 people eat for about Â£50-60 pounds or 100-130 SG dollars
3
We were craving for some Italian food so we decided to try this restaurant just outside the Bras Brasah MRT. We always passed by this resto every time we pass this area.For our starters, we had their calamari and pizza carpaccio. I love the pizza and the tenderloin was so delicate and tasteful. The serving was quite big also. Then on to the main course. I wonder why we never chose their pastas. We decided instead to try their Sliced Grilled Beef Rib-eye and the Breaded Medallions. The medallions were nice but to starchy and big that I had a hard time finishing it. I though that the medallions would be serve in small serving but it came out to be one huge medallion. Hehe.I would rate the resto as average as the price does not justify the taste except the pizza. It was just so-so for me. Plus there was one Ang Mo waitress that was very snobbish and looked very grumpy. Total bill: $12
5
We had a great evening. I had the sea food risotto and it was perfect. My wife had tagiatelle bolognase that she raved about. The crowing glory was the tiramisu that was the best we have ever had. It's also large enough to share!
4
Enjoyed dinner here - wine of the month was really good and the food was delicious. Highlights included the eggplant parmigiana and the bruschetta, which was very fresh. Very nice ambience also.
4
Like its name, the food is very Italian and their dessert is just as good! A cosy restaurant in a convenient location, this place is good for gatherings.
5
I came here for lunch before visiting the Art Museum.
They offer a set lunch for $28 ++.
The food, atmosphere and service was amazing. I look forward to visiting again.
3
it's a busy night yet this Filipina waitress greeted us and accommodated us in a very professional, conversational manner with perfect English! She made sure we had our drinks and passing us over to another waitress for our food orders, who we find hard to understand. Service done by this filipina is worth coming back! And the food is great
4
Made a reservation for a birthday for a friend, really homely decor that puts you at ease. An European lady that attended to us was both professional and friendly. Portions were big. Only reason it was not 5 star was because they charged us for the birthday tiramisu
2
This restaurant was the first we tried due to it's proximity to our hotel. The food is good but nothing special. I ordered a pizza Carpaccio which I didn't like at all but the Bolognese pasta which my partner ordered was quite good.However, the service was terrible. We were served by two waitresses. One didn't talk at all and she seemed to be always in a rush. and the other spoke so softly that we couldn't hear much of what she was saying.On the bright side, the ambiance of the restaurant is lovely and other customers seemed to be having a good time. Maybe with different food choices and different waiters, this place could be a nice place for a meal
4
This place is really handy and the food is extremely tasty, the service excellent and the surroundings convivial. Shared the mixed grill with the better half and there was enough for lunch the following day too! The lasagne was also extremely good too. Not the cheapest by the time you've added 2 bottles of wine, but you get what you pay for. Will certainly be back
4
The food here is really good ....nothing pretentious but good wholesome Italian cooking. The staff are great and the service is attentive and pleasant.The only downside is that it can get pretty noisy due to large groups of diners .... I recorded a noise level in there last Friday night that was getting up to 90dB on occasions ! so if you want a quiet dinner don't go on a Friday night ..... am sure its not always like this though.Well worth a try ........
5
Not much to add that I haven't before.... Great food (prosciutto with mozzarella, great bread, followed by pizza / pasta / steak - all good). Very enjoyable and relaxed atmosphere, good aperitifos, decent house wine, what's not to like!?Service is always perfect, never a complaint. We were all stuffed so had a single, delicious dessert between all four of us, plus some limoncello... Subsequently given another round on the house!
4
We was here many times. Nice location and ambiance.Excellent food and fast service.Quite expensive but dishes worth the cost. Have a complaint only for toilettes. Have to walk on the other side of building to get in.
Will return with friends.
4
I'll visited the trattoria lafiandra yesterday and it was grateful and worth it because the staff assisted me in a nice way.and the food was so delicious.So nxt time that I will take dinner in a restaurant,I probably put it on my list.
5
Trattoria Lafiandra gives you the opportunity to satisfy your hunger with gourmet pizza and quinch your thirst with Italian wines. I love this place and will definitely come back!!!
5
We enjoyed two meals here, and would travel back again just for the food and the excellent service. Just amazing
5
It was a great experience to have a dinner in this italian restaurant, which is awarded by Tripadvisor few years ago. We have tried to eat there once and it was a fantastic experience. From the meal preparation, romantic atmosphere and even the staff service, are really awesome. We enjoyed eating there since the foods are genuine italian foods. The meals are mouth-watering. Truly delicious and worth it to eat. I thought we were in Italy. So we're gonna comeback when we visit Singapore again
5
I tried many dishes in this resto because i dine there with my family and in laws,so we order a lot and everything is beyond my expectation..pizza and pasta is really great!!!i love the ravioli!!!my family always recommend trattoria to friends who would travel and explore sg..dessert is also a must try in this resto and talking about the atmosphere of trattoria lafiandra its like im dining in italy!!!:):):
1
First They told me the wine is sweet, but actually it is dry; the manager explanation is the wine compare to others is sweet! Second I asked them to give me a bit to try, the staff said ok but they end up serving me the whole glass, I asked why the manager told me they don't do tasting; last but worst is there are a lot of sands in the dishes and manager said it is normal. The way the manager talk to me is look like he wanna beat me up. It is an horrify experience I will never ever go back ever
4
This restaurant has been around for ages - shows that it has good steady stream of returning customers. The pizza is good , freshly done on the spot, wide selection of pasta and mains.My colleague had the lamb shank and it had three huge pieces! At first the price of Sgd42 on the menu looked steep but after it came with 3 pieces, it was worth the money. This place is so versatile. Business or leisure meals, romantic or catchup sessions with friends can all be conducted her
4
This cozy restaurant is located in my Secondary 2 classroom when this Art Museum was St. Joseph's Institution; so much for schoolboy nostalgia. It is cozy because it is not too large to be overwhelming or too small to be intimidating, and service is attentive but discreet. The seafood soup is truly delicious with a generous serving of mussels, clams, shrimps, bite-sized pieces of fish, etc. sitting atop a slurp-tasty thick soup. This, together with an order of bread, is good enough for a meal in itself. Outstanding
5
Despite turning up just before closing, the kind staff accommodated us without problem. The service and atmosphere were perfect, very traditional "Italian family" feel to the place. Food was fantastic, great prosciutto and mozzarella starter, lovely big pizza, decent fresh pasta and heart wine. No complaints, looking forward to going back soon. Oh, and they were not snobby at all - offered to pack our inevitably unfinished pasta and pizza, which we gratefully accepted!
5
Well worth a visit. While the pizza is good the other dishes are great. We were in town for business and ended up going several times. Staff were really friendly and helpful too. Thanks for looking after us
5
This restaurant is fairly small but has a good atmosphere and the staff are very attentive. The food is traditional Italian cuisine and was exactly what wanted. I can recommend this restaurant.
5
good and well trained staff (a plus in Sg), nice location and authentic italian Pizza, personally my favourite in town.
4
Found this Italian restaurant by sheer chance as it was very near our hotel, ie. about ten minutes walk away. Would thoroughly recommend it to anyone in Singapore for whatever reason.Excellent food, a good wine list, friendly and attentive staff.As good as you'll get in London or Europe.In fact we liked it so much we dined there twice. Oh, and by the way the prices are very reasonable too.Well worth a visi
5
I came here one night as my stomach felt homesick and expressed its desire for some Italian food. It was not disappointed. The food came quickly and was delicious. Most importantly, the recipe did not seem to have been altered to cater for international customers; it was the original one, whether you like it or not. The portion of gnocchi was good, but the portion of meat (saltimbocca alla romana) would have been enough for a couple of tall young men. Good location. Pleasant atmosphere inside. Also very importantly, the prices were in line with the market and reasonable for the quality offered. Recommended

@thekuoknowsTrattoria Lafiandra reminds me of school. Not because the food is tasteless and bland. Far from it. It is simply because where the restaurant is situated today is where I spent my teenage years at SJI learning the three "R"s.Lafiandra is probably one of the best restaurants in Singapore for basic Italian food - the kind of food that an Italian mother would be proud to call her own.It is wholesome; it is simple and, most importantly, the portions are generous.The bolognese sauce - a litmus-test for any Italian restaurant - is rich, colourful and packed full of flavour. It ideally complements the pasta, which is cooked to al dente perfection.The pizzas are just divine. They are thin and crispy, with just the right amount of cheese and toppings to make every mouthful an open invitation to go back for more...and more...and more.Trattoria Lafiandra cooks good Italian food and serves good Italian food. If you are looking for la dolce vita in Singapore, then Trattoria Lafiandra comes pretty close to it
4
This would be one of my favourite Italian places in Singapore for a few good reasons: the food servings are reasonably sized, the service is very attentive and professional, ambiance is "unpretentious-casual-chic", and the prices are commensurate with the central location, within the arts precinct of Bras Basah.Above everything else, the quality of the food is really good. Every time we go for dinner, we come out with a contented smile. The squid-ink pasta is a rarity to find in an Italian menu these days, and LaFiandra makes a superb version of it.We will keep coming back for more
4
Pleasant dining experience. Good selection on menu.Server was very attentive. I had mushroom risotto - was delivered very hot to the table. Good flavor but rice seemed a bit overdone as I prefer al dente. Very nice tasting bread and had excellent flavor on the caprese salad - huge portion - would easily have covered two diners
4
Hubby dear surprised with me a date last night by taking me to this restuarant. We got a nice seat next to the window and the waitress was very warm. I told her i was a vegetarian and she recommended me the eggplant with basil starter. The food and wine served here are the best so far. Further she recommended riviolli and i loved every bit of it. Tiramisu was too good. We had a great time and a lovely ambience too
4
We often go to Lafinadra and the food is consistently good. The red table checkered table clothes and general ambiance are pleasant and you can eat outside or indoors.The grilled Bass is excellent as are the thin pizzas. Price is not cheap - one salad, one fish, one pizza and half carafe of house wine $140 Sing more than enough for two people; upper medium priced for Singapore. I could do without the staff pushing wine/beverages to the point of it being a bit annoying, but I'll go back
5
This was a real surprise, you feel in italy !!!
A very obliging waiter who suggested us a nice bottle of wine served with class, the waitresses attentive and very friendly and the food ... just super delicious !!!!!
Definitely recommended!
5
And also most authentic! Food is always amazing and service is always pleasant! Love it! The place is cozy and the decor is original! Definitely a must visit place!
5
Business lunch, I expected just another Italian but they blew me! Excellent service, good atmosphere, excellent food. U can really tell the ingredients are fresh. Will definitely go back!
5
Quick stop over in Singapore. Found this restaurant. Absolute gem. Food excellent, service brilliant, hence would highly recommend
5
I have been coming here since they opened at Prince Street many years ago. The food is always fantastic. I personally like a few favorites like the Grilled Seabass, Spring Chicken, Saltimboca (Pork) and the Zucchini with capellini and prawns.... never they have failed me once. Service is fantastic with really reasonable pricing for wine too! The owner and his wife is really passionate about what they do and you will always spot him running between the pizza station and the kitchen. One of the more hands on owner I've seen. I guess that's how you maintain the standard and quality of food which a lot of places lack these days. Portion is good, can be big for some people but I prefer bigger portions myself... my boyfriend always goes for the Costata (Beef) which is also must try if you are beef lover. Pair it with a nice bottle of red wine and you can always rely on the staff for recommendations according to your palate. Definitely must try place if you like rustic and authentic Italian fare.
5
Celebrated my Birthday here whilst on holiday in Singapore.Staff couldn't be more welcoming and attentive .The restaurant has a lovely traditional feel. My husband had one of the beef dishes which tasted amazing , the meat was so tender, I had seafood risotto - possibly the best I have ever eaten.Everything was presented beautifully - a perfect evening
5
Three of us had dinner here on Wednesday evening (10th December). The building is lovely and the ambiance great. We were given mini bruschetta and pizza bread free, with our pre-dinner drinks and extra pizza bread when we wolfed down the first batch. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful. Our first bottle of Amarone wine was corked but replaced quickly with apologies. The main courses were excellent and we enjoyed after dinner liquors from their extensive range. All in all a great night
3
We went here two nights in a row. First night, had a sweet lady from Romania and we just had a few glasses of wine. The wine ain't too shabby. I grew up near Napa, so I've been spoiled and try not to use that as a hindrance on judgement. Second night, different server. He fancied himself a wine guy because he had a wine key and understood the term "full body". His recommendation was out of our budget, which would have been fine if he did not continue to pressure us into buying it and then use a guilt tactic when we bought something else. "You should have gone with my recommendation." Verbatim on top of being told that we can afford it. We're backpacking; we can't. If you're a wine guy, you know good wines geared toward an individuals budget. They're called Somms. His food recommendations were the most expensive, so we weren't being waited on at that point. We were just being pressured into up selling his receipt. Never saw him again either. We were left alone the rest of the night once it got busy, and the awesome Romanian lady took care of us. It kind of put a damper on the night, which is unfortunate because it is really romantic and the food is nice and hearty. I would go back, but avoid certain people.
4
This restaurant was at a walking distance from my hotel. We were on business trip and we went there for dinner. I tried the pasta and pizza. Both were really good. The service was good and we were given some suggestions kindly. The decor is nice. I would recommend and would like to go there again. Location is good. Only disappointment was one of my friend was really hungry and as we usually expect bread basket to be served in an Italian restaurant my friend asked for it but it was on a charge
5
We have been to Trattoria Lafiandra several times and each time the meal and wine selection has been outstanding. Service is very quick and informative. I believe the value to be superior than most restaurants in Singapore. The atmosphere is great and location very convenient to Bras Basah and Dhoby Gaut MRTs. Definitely will return. Well done team at Trattoria Lafiandra
5
What a warm and wonderful Italian experience in Singapore. Food was excellent as was the service. Highly recommend you make the effort to get here for an exceptional dining experience.
5
I am biased - In Sing, by myself (Business) staying in a Hotel (Rendezvous) with a range of "European" places not far from Hotel (MRT Bras Basah). (Most are "food")This is my escape for some really good food. (It is always my "jet lag buster" :) Great ambience - simple, relaxed - Pizzas. Pastas, and some fantastic "Carnivore" food. Good quality wines by glass and bottle - I spent 3 years traveling Italy and although I am English (some of us enjoy real food) if this was a local restaurant at home in the UK - It would get a very high rating It is housed within a wing of what is today the S Modern Art Museum - in reality it was a convent - a few tables outside looking back at Chapel are quite special/atmospheric but likely to be humid.Very close to MRT Bras Basa
5
I lived in Italy for two years when I was younger, so I am always on the hunt for good Italian restaurants. I usually avoid most Italian restaurants outside Italy because they are just not that good. That is why I avoided Lafiandra's while on business in Singapore, so it took me over a week to finally visit. What a regret! I wish I had eaten there for every lunch and dinner for my whole trip. Lafiandra's counts as only one of two Italian restaurants I've ever been to that I can positively say serves real Italian food. Not only are the recipes correct, but the ingredients seem to be Italian too. I had a pizza with prosciutto, carbonara and gnocchi, and they were all excellant. If you like real Italian food I highly recommend visiting
5
On business trip in Singapore, discovered this restaurant by chance, walking from hotel to Marina Bay on a saturday morning. Decided to try on Saturday evening.Ambient is typical "italian outside Italy" but nice and clean. Very quiet, not too many customers (but was Singapore National Day). Personel friendly but correct. Menu with large selection of plates. What I selected (Carbonara, Tagliata with mushrums, Tiramisu) was very good, Italian style with minor adaptations (mushrums were local ones, of course...). Half bottle of wine available (which is good, as I was alone).Not cheap, but reasonable in Singapore for a big meal...I am an Italian living long periods in the Far East, always looking when possible for true Italian restaurants... this is one of the best
4
Have been there for business lunch with an Italian colleague as me. He is regular customer and maybe we had a special treatment, but i notice an overall good, relaxing and cozy atmosphere from all other table too. I order a classic Milanese steak that come really really huge as the plate, with perfectly baked potato and mushroom. My colleague went for beef tagliata also very generous portion. Italian waiter serve us well and suggest good small bottle of Barbaresco from Langhe made me feel home. After coffee limoncello from the house. I was invited so i do not saw the bill, but choosing food i did not notice any crazy price. Overall i have to be back, is really goo

Went to this restaurant a couple of years ago and enjoyed it - so we were back again (we enjoy a Singapore stopover after travelling in Europe - it breaks up the long trip back home to Sydney - this time from Paris). As soon as we sat down the staff began really pushing a wine upon us - before we had a chance to checkout the wine list. I think they were hoping that we didn't notice the prices involved - even the lowest price came in at about AU$65. We come from the wine growing district of The Hunter and know wines (and their value) pretty. The prices here were far and beyond reasonable - they were astronomic. I looked around and virtually no one was drinking wine. One unfortunate couple were virtually strong-armed into a red - they managed to belay the staff down to a half carafe of 'house red" - also terribly expensive. As we left I spoke to them - they were as dismayed as we were.The food was however quite good (and of reasonable value given that Singapore is a pretty expensive place anyway) - and the service excellentBut - watch out for the wine (we had water!)Tre
1
My wife and I went there after a film at SAM. My wife is African American, I am Anglo-Chinese. We ordered a pizza, two desserts and a drink, but when I tried to order plain tap water, the waitress insisted i order sparking imported water. I referred to the fact that everyone else in the restaurant was drinking regular Singapore tap water. After some back and forth I said if I can't have water with my pizza I would have to leave. She asked the chef who told us to get out and made an aggressive gesture of dismissal. I don't fully understand Italian hand gestures, but there is no doubt it was highly disrespectful.What makes me think this was motivated by racism was the fact that everyone else in the restaurant (all white or Asian) had water, much of which was tap water.When my wife confronted Chef Cataldo, he couldn't make eye contact with her and blurted out something about how he couldn't afford to wash water glasses. He complained that this was because the Singapore government (MOM) had refused to let him hire foreign dishwashers. However, I think the disrespectful way he treated us is likely due to his racism.I haven't commented on the food or value since we never got to eat our meal
4
As a quite frequent visitor to Singapore this is one of my regular haunts, Pasta Vongole, Lamb Cutlets needing fingers to eat them :) Good quality wine simple but attractive venue - there are a couple of tables outside with a great romantic setting (as long as you do not mind the humidity.Want a change of flavor more European, this is i
5
In my opinion definitely the best pizza in town.Combine this with a great setting and very efficient and friendly staff, as well as an extensive wine list, you find plenty of reasons to keep coming back.I can't say much about the rest of the food, as one is compelled to always have pizza ;)Definitely worth the trip and a detour 
4
And the black n blue 1.5kg côte de bœuf wasn't bad either. My first time to this modest trattoria, set inside a lovely and historic building on bras basah road. We had a fantastic meal from start (Campari/vermouth/soda aka Americano) to finish (Amarone grappa aka serious headache the next day).Service was thorough and polite.Ambiance could be better but I just love the building it's situated in (Singapore arts museum)
5
This italian restaurant is really wonderful great food and staff I would recommend it to anyone lovely pasta and really tasty food
4
Came here the first time as a couple and returned a few nights ago with friends. The food was delicious and service great - very friendly, efficient and attentive. Not an inexpensive dinner but worth it for the excellent food and service.
5
We ate at this wonderful trattoria twice during our stay in Singapore and were not disappointed on either occasion. The food is delicious and the menu sufficiently varied to suit both our tastes. The wine is perhaps a little expensive but again no complaints on palate or quality. The trattoria itself is located in an old colonial building next to the Museum of the Arts and the setting complimented the meal as all to often in Singapore modern overwhelms traditional so this was a most welcome and refreshing alternative. The ambience was excellent.The service was friendly and attentive clearly aimed at customer satisfaction and in every way Trattoria Lafiandra achieved this. Highly recommended
4
This Italian restaurant is a must visit when you have enough of the hawkers food stalls in Singapore. The place is nicely decorated with Italian sceneries and brick walls so that It's like we're in a restaurant somewhere along the Amalfi coast rather than the real location which is attached to the Singapore Art Museum . The menu is quite extensive, dishes are well chosen to satify everyone taste and the price is fair for such high quality food. For meat lovers : try the beef carpaccio and the mixed grill, you will love it. Service is very friendly and efficient and there is also a good choice of wine
4
We'd read the other TripAdvisor reviews and can happily report that this restaurant lives up to the billing. Friendly staff, a good typical Italian menu.We had bruschetta & garlic and then pizza, all what you would expect. Crunchy garlic bread, tasty bruschetta and lovely thin crust pizza. There's a good wine list, we had the house white & red, both perfectly acceptable. Didn't manage dessert, a good reason to return!
4
You can't beat this great location connected to the Singapore Art Museum. Food is very good, and you can't beat the price in Singapore (shared appetizer, salad and pizza for US $60). Our only complaint is that the service was a little too efficient...pizza arrived before we had finished our appetizer, hovering waiters waiting to whisk your plate away the moment you put down utensils, etc. This was a minor issue, and won't keep us from returning to this small gem
4
This Italian restaurant based near Singapore Art Museum, so art lovers if you are around museum, do not forget to try Italian food at this restaurant. Very nice ambiance..takes you through Italy..If you wish to fall in love with your loved one again...this is a perfect dining place to spend time with your loved one. Do not forget to try Seafood spaghetti, with clamps and prawns if you are non vegetarian
4
We visited on 27 January following good Trip Advisor reviews.And we were not disappointed. This is an Italian restaurant - and authentic. I had a beautifully cooked rib eye steak with mushrooms and onions and the usual trimmings. First class - really tasty. My wife had a penne pasta dish which she thought very good.Desserts were excellent - my Tartufo ice cream with expressly was historic whilst my wife's panacotta - very good. We had a beer and a coke. We were brought complimentary bruschetta crostinis - a nice touch. Staff were extremely pleasant. I would have given a 5 star but the music was too loud and intrusive whilst we didn't appreciate the lighting - far too bright. I found it slightly expensive at Â£106 SD - but actually worth every penny.But - if our first meal is anything to go by we will definitely go back. Best food we have ever had in Singapore
5
Place is just a few paces from Bras Basah mrt station. The food is 100% authentic italian and the flavour of all dishes is outstanding. The downside is the price, is it quite expensive, about 75 to 100 Singapore Dollars per person, but other than that the quality, the flavour and the quantity of the food ia excellent. Definitely is one place I would totally recommend if you come to Singapore
4
I found this place on TripAdvisor as we knew we were going to the museum today. It does have set times for dinner so we ended up eating BEFORE our museum visit to make the 2:30pm lunch cutoff time. The restaurant was not crowded and we opted to sit inside.The decor is nice: white tablecloths and tables well separated.The waitresses were indifferent: had to wave them down to order and water was not refilled. We ended up having a light lunch, I ordered Saltimbocca which was very flavourful and while it looked small on the plate, I was satisfied having loaded up on the warm bread.My partner had the tomato salad which was nice and refreshing although had lots of onions (I'm not partial to raw onions). He followed with the osso bucco in risotto. He was happy with it, to me it wasn't that much of a standout and the risotto was too mushy. I would go back for the Saltimbocca though
4
My husband and I have been fans of this trattoria for almost 10 years now. We follow our favourite Italian restaurant from its old premise at Prinsep Street to the present location. We always leave this place happy and satisfied
4
This restaurant ticks all of the boxes. The setting of the restaurant, the decoration inside, the lovely authentic Italian food and the attentive staff make it well worth checking out
5
Love the food here. We eat here 3 times in our 6 day stay. It was total class. Lovely pasta. Great calamari. Gorgeous garlic bread.
4
We were walk ins, tired and hungry after a big day of exploring the city. The service was great, the food was delicious - very fresh and tasty. Best of all we had room for dessert! If you are looking for Italian food this is a great place
5
I have been a regular customer at Trattoria Lafiandra for many years, even since its modest opening in a small shop house in Prinsep Street. Even though the location and scale of operation has changed, the exceptional quality of the food and the great value have never changed. At times, I have been a weekly patron of this fantastic restaurant, and I can't count the number of Pizza Carpaccios I have eaten there and become known for. I have been away from Singapore for most of this year, and I miss this trattoria dearly. The menu does not feature anything snobbish or fancy, just traditional Italian dishes, but made to perfection. If you want truffles and molecule food, this is not it.My personal favourites are: Pizza Carpaccio - A sensational pizza topped raw beef and sliced parmesanPizza Bianca Pomodoro - This is a must!! Works great as a shared starterLasagna - traditional, but made to perfectionOssobuco with risotto - solid and heavy, but so goodCotoletta Alla Milanese - It is huge, but heavenlyEverything else on the menu is also made with utmost care and perfection. The service is friendly, but also professional. This place works equally well as a venue for business dinners or with family or friends. The location is also great, being at the bottom of Orchard Road, where Bras Basah Road begins, in walking distance from the entrance of an MRT station.I look forward to my next visit

I had dinner at Lafiandra tonight after reading some of the reviews here. I can truly say that you guys were spot on!It is located just 5 minutes walk from my hotel with nearby bars so it made for a perfect night out for me and my date. We were warmly greeted by the hostesses and were seated promptly. The ambience was great. It is a quiet restaurant with an amazing wine selection. Everything we ordered was delicious and presented nicely (see photos). It is very rare that I find restaurants like this. It is not cheap, but you do get what you pay for. AND OMG...YOU MUST TRY THE TIRAMISU <3The only thing I didn't like (and this is no fault of the restaurant itself) was a minor incident with the waitress. Being from North America (Toronto), I believe it customary for the server to speak to the female patron and take her order before the male patron. Our female waitress seemed much more interested in speaking to my date first. I did discuss this with her, respectfully, and she apologized many times over and even sent a complimentary appetizer to our table

We have been frequenting Lafiandra for many years - even when it was still a tiny restaurant in Prinsep street! It is our "special occasion" restaurant - our place of choice for quiet family dinners to celebrate birthdays, Christmas, etc (any excuse really)! The wait staff are attentive, and wonderful. The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect and I love that it is located in the museum. Our must-have dishes are: - Involtini di melanzane con mozzarella- Linguine al nero di seppia e calamariAlso with some Bruschette al pomodoro, salad and moscato. Pizzas are also delish there, with my favourite being the Prosciutto E Funghi. I'm thinking of their squid ink linguine now, and looking forward to my next visit there! A* restaurant and one I have highly recommended to many friends around Singapore

We stopped in after dinner and they were kind enough to allow to take up a table to split a carafe of wine. The next night, we returned for dinner and we were not disappointed. Excellent food and wine selection. The service was pleasant. If you find yourself near the Bras Basah MRT station, it is worth a stop, for a glass of wine or dinner

We quite liked the general setting of the restaurant amidst the Singapore Art Museum. It was a nice mix of old and new. From the inside the restaurant was done up quite well - very different from the outside though - more conventional. The lighting and the ambience was very nice and I am sure on a busy night the presence of the crowd will really add to the overall experience. There is arrangement for sitting outside, although I do not know how noisy it would be.Now to the food - we had the parma ham with the buffalo cheese and the garlic bread and the thin pizza bread with garlic to start with. The mains were salmon pasta and grilled chicken. The food was all very tasty and presented well. Everything was very fresh. The salmon pasta was just divine. It had a fantastic light feeling to it and scented and tasted as good as any dish anywhere. We had some house pour with the food and the quality there too was quite good. The pricing was also quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the general positioning of the restaurant. Overall, certainly good value for money and one of the best pastas one can get in Singapore. A must do

The tenderloin was fantastic! succulent, fresh, very awesome fries!!!!! Beef spaghetti was great too!! LOVE THE FOOD! LOVE THE SERVICE!!

We heard about this place from a friend and thought we would give it a try and was certainly not disappointed. Is housed in a lovely old colonial building and we outside which was very pleasant and not noisy even though we were close to a road.The food was very good and great value for money. We both had pan fried john dory fillets which were excellent, i was salivating about them the next day.The service was typically Singapore efficient LAH! I will definitely go again next time we are in tow

I've been living in Southeast Asia for a while and this is the first Italian place worth highlighting. We had bruschette and pasta and it was very good. Ingredients were fresh, sauces we're fresh and very well done.The restaurant itself is very nice too and easily accessible especially by metro.Prices we're normal for me being Canadian, around $22 for a normal pasta serving.Deseserts we're succulent
4
We first visited this restaurant a few years ago and were pleasantly surprised so decided to check it out again. We were happy to see that is as good as it was then. Great food - perhaps one of the best Lasagnas I've had outside of Italy. Staff are efficient and prices (for food) are reasonable. Wine though, as it is elsewhere in Singapore, was expensive which can be overlooked for a special occasion

My wife and I visited Trattoria Lafiandra during the restaurant week. We ordered the fillet of seabass and crab meat Aglio Olio as our main courses.My wife had to spit out three fish bones and a mouthful of fish scales on her first bite into her fillet of seabass. I had to cough out a piece of crab shell in my Aglio Olio. That is just not acceptable right? Wrong, according to the restaurant managerI asked the manager politely if fish bones and fish scales are expected and acceptable to be in the dish (pointing at the 3 bones and fish scale). She explained very politely to me that the seabass they used are rather small so it is common to find some fish bones and fish scales in the fillet. No apologies were offered.Well, I thanked her for her explanation but decided that I will not be returning to Trattoria Lafiandra. To me, it is a basic requirement for any decent restaurant to ensure that the fish are cleaned properly. I mean, even most of the stalls in hawker centers serving japanese bento sets will have their fish bones and scales removed right?Food wise, there is no wow factor. Pleasant (if I overlook on the fish bones) but forgettable. Not worth spending that couple of hundreds for a dinner there

I have come here several times now and I think it has even improved. The food is very good, portions are generous and there is a great selection of pastas, pizzas and other main courses. I have tried several of them and all were excellent. Even the steak was done exactly as ordered. Service - well it is still Singapore - but I think it has improved a lot since I first came. Most of the staff is very friendly and they are pretty attentive. I man it doesnt compare to Europe of course but I think it is good enough. The setting is very nice, decoration is nice. The only thing that I think can improve is the restroom. Its outside (as most of the time here), most of the time locked so no passing pedestrians can use it but still its not that clean. This time I came during restaurant week and I was also impressed. They had very generous portion throughout the 4 course menu (plus bread and coffee) which I have seen differently in other restaurants already. They did not play cheap and reall offered a great value for money. Thank you.Thumbs up! Food is great and thats whats important! I will return

Been back at least twice (x2) since the first review.Once for the company early Chirstmas dinner party... decent value according to the boss who paid... lots of wine consumed, food portions were HUGE!The seafood platter is a full meal for 2 local persons... [Seriously this is European sized!] but it's labelled as a "Starter".Disappointment was the "Pork Medalion" (which was a super HUGE medalion of pork, the size of a standard dinner plate, crumbled and deep fried).Lamb Chops were a little small for a main, I felt... but the steak was good, though we did not get to order the 2-3 person beef rib/steak thingy... Lamb Shank was good, though could have used less salt in my opinion.=

We ate here as a couple back in June 2012 and this time took our teenage kids and a very good friend for Christmas eve dinner.This place is great! relaxed; excellent Italian trattoria food, ie fresh fish; great cottoletta milanese, excellent bisteccas, very good pasta, coupled with a terrific wine list with reasonable (for Singapore!) prices, and friendly, attentive, and not "in-your-face" service.We had a lovely night at what is becoming a must-do for our Singapore visits
5
After having been away from Singapore for some month our fist meal out was - where else - at Lafiandra. Delighted to report that the food has remained as excellent as ever, the buzz is more and more lively as more people discover this gem of a restaurant. Must be best value for money in town. The service is worth special mention - where can you find a service attendant who remembers which dish, what kind of water and how you wish your pizza to be cooked - our heartfelt thanks to Yuen for the truly oustanding service and personal attention. Mr. Lafriandra is busy in the kitchen and ensures the high quality of all the food ordered - but finds time to say good-bye personally. Behind his success there is a lot of hard work. Bravo Lafiandra

Visited for lunch with three children. Service wa fantastic. All our food wa brilliant. Our children loves their gnocchi with tomato sauce, the mozzarella with tomato and mushroom sup for starter was delightful and our baked tagliatelle and tuna salad where perfect. Wine list is good. Great food and service and appropriate pricing.

the best italian restaurant in singapore,when i arrived in singapore i can resist to go eat at La Fiandra, delicious food, best pizza never eat in asia like that, simple and genuine,big experience of the chef & owner Cataldo.

Went for dinner, place is very busy Sat evening, reservation highly recommended, outdoor seating under museum arcades. Friendly and competent service. We liked: crispy bruschetta, excellent ragu and apple tart, however the frutti di mare sauce was not fresh and the tuna salad, although generously apportioned felt like from the tin. Wine was good, but too warm.Would we come again: mayb

We visited this restaurant quite a few times and we were never disappointed. The service is good, Italian food was the most authentic in the City and the house red was delightful.Eating inside the restaurant is a typically lively Italian experience with a bustling atmosphere, eating outside is a little quieter and very well serviced with excellent canopy providing cooling fans and lighting if required.My lower score of 4 in respect of value for money is more in relation to Singapore being an expensive place to eat and drink western food rather than the restaurant specifically
5
We went for lunch on Sunday, our family of four, easy and free parking in front of the museum, nice welcome by the stuff. The food was nicely served. We ordered fresh mozzarella, pasta, pizza and risotto - all were very good. The risotto was a bit too salty but still good, the pizza and Solomon pasta were excellent. Dishes are bit small but still reasonable. House white win was great s well. The space is pleasant and service was efficient.

Restaurant Week Menu for us ($55++ set)Very very full... Quality was good... Though u could see the portions were smaller (eg. Our pasta vs the ala carte order on the next table - which costs $22.60, was definitely smaller)We had an appetiser platter of grill squid on salad, Parma ham & Melon (Italian melon much better than the local produce available in SG), veal/beef w a tuna mayo type sauce... Very satisfying... Memories of our 3 week Italian holiday...Pumpkin soup - not bad, not too starchy not too watery... I'm not a soup fan (wife finished her bowl). Had an almond biscuit floating that made it sweet after a while...Beef steak was cooked nicely though a bit rarer than what wife ordered.I had the pasta which was good. (see comment on size above)Dessert was good, wife enjoyed her tiramisu and I had the ice cream (too full by then really)Will return to try their ala carte menu! Other table had a $128 "rib" ~1kg which looked fantastic... And they also had squid ink pasta which the wife was salivating over (will definitely be ordering that next time) Very happy and pretty good service experience till the end around 9.30pm when 5-7 tables walked in, then the staff got busy and could not remember our tea/coffee order, came back to check and still got my tea wrong... I don't mind peppermint (asked for green) so did not make a fuss.

This restaurant makes it to my favorite choices in Singapore! Starting from a great Italian atmosphere, extremely friendly staff, great Italian food of an authenticity I gave up to seek in Asia, this restaurant offers also an extensive wine list with top italian wines (pio cesare, santa christina etc. also more top notch wines) for extremely reasonable prices, this restaurant just offered us a great evening. And for western food in S'Pore, the food prices are really low, too. If you are a tourist looking for some real western cuisine again or like myself an expat being fed up with asian food once in a while: give this place a try

My office was very near to this restaurant. Always thought to visit it for dinner on Fridays. Finally one day managed to persue friends to eat here.We reached the restaurant around 10:20 pm on a Friday. We were not approached by the waitress and no one warned us about the time constraint there. But we did like the decor inside the restaurant. It was relaxing and calm.By the time we all decided what to order, it was almost 10:28. Finally the waitress arrived after our beckoning and each of us told her the orders. Thats when she looked [a bit particularly] at her wrist watch and then said "Sorry, last order for food is at 10:30. The kitchen closes at 10:30. You can only order drinks now."OMG! we were like "Oh No! can you make an exception". Ans was "No". "Is there anything at all available that we can order?" Ans was "No".I really felt so embarrassed. It was my request that everyone came and on top of that we had made it in time also. But no one in the restaurant even approached us in time and warned us about this.Finally had to go find food in the nearby food court [Has a fabulous Mexican place in there] as by that time everyone was so hungry that we could not think of anyplace else to try and take risk now.But the next time I go there, I think I will definitely try the restaurant again. But to the people reading this review, please do keep in mind the time constraints there

Trattoria Lafiandra is in a very nice setting next to the Art Museum. Most of the seating is indoors, but if you're willing to forgo the aircon you can sit outside in the colonnade. The menu is fairly typical Italian trattoria fare with all the standard classics plus an extensive range of pizze and pasta dishes. It's surprising how many restaurants can't do a decent caprese salad, but the one I had here was very good. My pizza was also very good, with a crispy base and generous toppings.We had a very pleasant meal and I think this place is certainly worth trying if you're in the market for a straightforward Italian
5
Walked past it three times while exploring but didn't go in until our last day.Wanted a big feed before 24 hours of plane food.I saw the beef cannelloni on the menu and drooled. We tend to only get spinach and ricotta at home. Seated, sorry, no cannelloni, we are still making it. Before my tears could try the manager arrived at the table, I could have it if I waited 20 minutes. Hell yeah. I love that 20 minutes in Singapore is a long time. Every thing that hit the table was good and we even got free bruschetta because of "the wait" .enjoy it, we did.shwa

It had been two years since I last visited Trattoria Lafiandra and it was again a fantastic experience. The staff were great, attentive, knowledgeable and were attentive to the customers. The atmosphere of the restaurant warm and welcoming from when we entered to the most wonderful smell of cooked garlic to the end of dinner. The food was excellent. Great quality, well presented and aboslutely delicious. I shared the caprese and bruscetta and had cannelloni for the main.I will definitely go back there. We went on a Monday evening and it was busy by the time we left. I would recommend making a reservation
5
There are two amazing things at Lafiandra: the pasta (my personal favourite: the black ink pasta with squids) and the "cote de boeuf" for 2 with the porcini sauce (do not hesitate to ask for a refill of porcini sauce: my wife and I do not!). Perfect with a bottle of excellent Italian wine: just plan to go back home in a cab :

I havent visited this place since it moved from Prinsep Street, which I found out was over 7 years ago! The service is refreshingly well balanced, and very responsive; something very rare in Singapore. The food was great too, the buratina was fresh and creamy. The parma ham served as a starter was quite decent as well. Pasta for mains was well put together and the ossobucco with saffron risotto was lovely. Good wine list with some strong super tuscans. Tiramisu was delicious for dessert
5
My partner and I stumbled across this place by accident after being turned off by the hour long wait at the Singapore Museum restaurant. We ordered a pizza to share and it was delicious, the service was friendly and fast depsite a packed restaurant. Glad we found it and we will be back again!
5
The food here is extra special - so much so, I've eaten here at least seven times during the course of my stay. Whether as part of a group or as a couple, the ambience and service have been fantastic and I would highly recommend this great little restaurant.I haven't had a disappointing meal yet, and the Caesar salad is one of my all time favourites - closely followed by just about everything else on the menu
5
Ever since my first trip to Singapore, I've been going to Trattoria Lafiandra. So much so that although I might only get to Singapore in intervals of 6-12 months, the manager recognizes me & says things like "ah, you've made it back" every time !It's very hard to beat that kind of service, and furthermore, I go back because I love Italian food & have simply not found a better place. The chef is actually Italian, so that probably helps, and the meals are recreated as you would find in a restaurant in Rome.My favourites include their Lasagne, which is really good, or they do a great Penne Arrabiata & Spaghetti Bolognese. It's a little on the expensive side at about $25-30SGD for a main, but if you want good quality food, you will pay it gladly.It's really easy to find - it is right across the road from the Bras Basah MRT station, and if you are on Orchard Rd (near Carrefour/Dhoby Gaut MRT), keep following the road south-east on foot and you will see after Orchard Rd becomes Bras Basah Rd, the large red "SAM" letters out the front of the old colonial building of the Singapore Art Musuem. Trattoria Lafiandra is to the left of the entrance.Unfortunately, the only picture I seem to have of the inside of the restaurant was when my camera got wet in the rain, & I was trying to get it to work again, and I photographed the floor and part of a table 
5
I have been to this restaurant 5 times and every time it does not disappoint. Service is good, and the food is excellent. There are few good Italian restaurants in Singapore, but this one passes the test. The pizzas, pastas, and fishes are all worth a try. Nice casual setting

After visiting the Singapore Art Museum, we stopped at this Italian restaurant for dinner. It smelt wonderful inside, but alas, without a reservation we were relegated to an outside table. (That was fine; if it had been a wet and windy night, not so much. So give them a call and make a reservation, or pray for no rain.)Service was prompt and friendly, and although it took them a little time to bring our starters (9pm is clearly a busy time) the food was great: a delicious plate of bruschetta, and then a good, fiery penne alla'arrabiatta. My wife was slightly less convinced by her tuna salad, although that was because it was solely tuna and leaves; perhaps not the most elegantly adorned dish, but it did as advertised.Location is lovely, especially on a balmy night. Outdoors in the full blast of a Singapore sunny day might be a slightly less pleasant experience.
5
We spotted this restaurant after walking the length of Orchard Street and it's many malls. It's siting in the Art Museum building was what attracted us and on inquiring for a table that evening were invited to look inside and given a drink with the menu. We were not dissappointed with our meal then night. We started with saleds that were more than enough and were well prepared and tasty. My wife then had John Dory fillet served with roast potatoes and a side saled whilst I had veal - both were large portions and were served on carving plates, also a dish of young spinach. Washed down with an excellent carafe of wine. We will return in the future. Thanks Chef Cataldo

Recommended by Italian friend and have been one of our favourite restaurants since 2007.FOOD - Quality of the food is very good and great consistency over the time.SERVICE - Staffs perform high maintenance of the customers while dining. They come and check whether the food is okay (not common in Singapore). If you are not satisfied with the food, you will have quick response.WINE - They have good list of wine. Those wines cannot be found easily in winery shops and they worth the price. I liked one of them so much and ended up with buying a new one.AMBIENCE - From the door, you will have a good oven cooking smell. Good and comfortable atmosphere in light, wall painting, and tables. TIPS - There are only 4-5 tables with soft cushioned chairs and reservation is must if you want to have them. Alternatively, you can ask the staffs to give you a cushion for the chair since it is wooden chair. Sometimes, the staff mood is not so good and they do not smile, talk smoothly, and forget what you have to have by default

After arriving in Singapore late the previous day and a Hawker centre for lunch, the kids (5, 9 and 13) wanted Pizza! I called the restaurant who were very accommodating and we didn't mind sitting outside given we are Aussies. The starters were very good quality and service quick, smiley and efficient. A good wine selection given our experience of Asian restaurants over the years.Pastas were good, Pizzas very good quality and one sufficient for a our two smallest. A nice setting in the colonial gallery surrounds and very close to the MRT
