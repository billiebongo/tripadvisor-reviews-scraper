Verre is a quiet and nice place for an early evening meetup. extensive wine selection for glass pours.
4
We had a table outside at the terrace. You look over the river.
We had a hamburger and lamb chops. Both were good.
Location is very good. Surrounded by many bars and restaurants.
5
Food choices are good and price are reasonable .I really enjoy the food and wine . service staff very friendly and Excellent.I recommend for excellent food for sg
4
It was a quite night out with mu wife. Food was good and we had a good time. Limited dessert choices but not an issue. Atmosphere was good
5
Great food and a superb wine (2008 Barossa Shiraz) at a very reasonable price - a real find. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.
5
Marvelous wine & awesome food that made us to return as many times as possible. It will be good to have membership & rewards!
5
We searched for a nice spot to drink and eat. By accident, we found the Verre which convinced us immediately with good wine and a lovely location as well as a small menu. You could go there just for wine and wine bites as well as for having a good dinner.Tim

Great food, tip top tarte flambé and excellent roast lamb, served with a wonderful creamy mash. Food here is constantly good and the service is always friendly and efficient. Wine choice and price is generally good as well. It looks a bit cavernous inside and often gets overlooked for other restaurants along the front, I don’t know why as it is really good here. Usually it’s me and she who must be obeyed eating here, even flying solo it’s a decent spot to watch Singapore stroll by
5
This place is awesome. Casual, relaxed vibe with French food and wine appreciation. Modern bistro it is! I sat outside and watched the world go by: runners, children on scooters, lovers hold hands all while I drank a lovely Sancerre and ate a tarte flambé! I would highly recommend this place
4
It has been quite some time since I last visited this place, but the opportunity arose for a return visit recently. The happy hour is a really good deal with 1:1 on most of the wines by the glass up until 8pm (whereas most of the other happy hour deals in the area end at 7pm). The wine is served in decent wine glasses too which somehow enhances the experience. We also chose a few of the appetisers to accompany the wine - also very tasty. Friendly and efficient service. Well worth another visit
5
We visited Verre wine bar as it was only a few metres from our hotel, we were not disappointed! The wine selection was fantastic and the food was scrumptious. The staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly.
1
Saturday night. Not that busy.
Sat down for 5mins and went totally unnoticed.
I got up and left.
If I have to beg for service, the Verre gets one star just because I can't rate you anything less than that.
5
Grab a bottle of wine with a plate of cheese or charcuterie and you won’t be disappointed. Outside seats are great with a view on the river.
5
Fabulous meal tonight, lamb outstanding, wonderful ambience. You should go ! Best meal out in Singapore by miles.
5
Being a Tuesday around 10 pm this was one of the only restaurants willing to accommodate our party of nine. We were not disappointed service was good as was the food.
4
Great location, good wine list, comfortable environment, and very tasty food. But for the service - slow and inattentive - a good find.
4
Was strolling along the riverside early evening and spotted this place. Noticed an excellent Happy Hour,generously extended to 9pm,and decided to give it a go. Surprisingly quiet,but we were inside. Al Fresco,was the popular choice. Nice Staff and food. Good Value too
1
Wine is very expensive, starting at 80SGD for a bottle of very low quality French wine. We tried one and asked it to be replaced as it was corcked. Waiter was not happy at all and said wine was fine. After few arguments, he agreed to replace it. Charcuterie platter was basic without bread and served with weird biscuit. Overall staff have no knowledge about wine or whatsoever, this is not a wine bar at all, very bad experienc

We were in search of a wine bar for a dinner on a Sunday night and we came across Verre. Actually we have passed this bistro many times during our stroll in Robertson Quay area, but every time we skipped it and chose another place instead. One thing I recall, this place never looked crowded at all.So anyway, we finally tried it. Restaurant was empty but we needed to push to get our preferred table by the window. The waitress mentioned it is their restaurant policy, but after awhile did let us sit there. Not a very good first impression. But please do not get me wrong, the waitress who waited on us was friendly, and trying her best, but in general there are some misses, this being one of them. And btw, we were not being rude as well.At the time of ordering, the waitress recommended their daily special menu and specifically recommended the suckling pig. Alas, the suckling pig was out of stock. My message to service staff everywhere, please check inventory with the kitchen staff before strongly recommending a daily special menu with limited quantity!The food itself has some highlights. We ordered the spicy crusted chicken mid-wing --- very crispy, very nicely spiced and fried, and accompanied by spicy sauce. I could come back again to this place just to eat this withy a glass of cold beer. Besides that, we ordered the pate board and wagyu tenderloin. Pate board consists of 3 types of duck pate with different flavoring --- orange, french onion, and burgundy, and some baguette. Duck pate is good, I prefer the burgundy and french onion as they are less sweet. Wagyu tenderloin is good (but then you would expect no less from a $59 wagyu beef). Both pate board and wagyu tenderloin came with salad on the side --- too sweet for our liking. From the general tone of the food --- from the spicy sauce, the pate, the salad --- I would say they are more on the sweet side. Hope to have more balance next time.Net, a good place with nice ambience to hang out with friends or family, for wine or even beer, and some nice snacks. One of those places you can come back time and time again. I for sure will try again and hope that the next time the experience will be nicer than this

I had a very enjoyable evening here, with excellent food and wine (from a substantial list by the glass), in a relaxed and quiet setting. There was also a generous weekday happy hour promotion, so I could get 2 glasses of the same wine for the price of one, which was fantastic value.I ordered the grilled salmon, the Marcel Deiss Gewürztraminer, and the Massolino Barbera d'Alba.The grilled salmon was excellent; the fish was very well-cooked, and the banana dressing + avocado gave the quinoa plenty of flavour and texture. The fragrance from the bananas paired really nicely with the floral rose notes of my Gewürztraminer wine.The next wine, a Barbera, was excellent. Young leather, blackberries, and a long-lasting spicy finish. A great end to a peaceful evening.I was also very happy with the service, which was prompt and effective. I also appreciated that they had a sommelier to recommend me wines based on my preferences and what I am having.This is definitely a place to return to for more of their food and wines
5
Luckily ended up at here at happy hour and so this ended up being quite a relaxing wine and cheese afternoon that didn't end up costing too much.
Definitely would return.
5
I visit Verre at least once a week...I I live in Robertson Quay. I enjoy the very fresh oysters, creamy and luxurious duck rilletes, garlic prawns and all other dishes are often made perfectly and the wide choices of wines.
3
The service and food was excellent but by our standards expensive, but then everything in Singapore appears to be expensive by UK standards.
5
I became a client.. the wines always good quality and the food too. Love the oysters and some special platters as cheese and terrine ones. Nice tarte flambÃ© too. From the staff is the best you can have in the area Kumar David Christy ... also Joshua inside the bar doing some plates is always a good welcome. I can't forget a French waiter who for French community makes it a French bistro ... have inside or outside is always a pleasure with the view of the river. Happy hours during week till 9 and weekend till 6 but always good double check. Also there you will met uncle who is a lovely man who take care of the business always with a treat for who comes outside with the dogs . Many reasons for me and some other people become Verre clients...
4
This is a nice place to chill with friends. They have an extensive wine selection. Most places only offer 2 types of wine for HH. At Verre they have much more and they are all good wine! The cheese tarte flambee and spicy crusted chicken paired well with the wine. Will definitely visit again to try their mains
4
Really a nice place to have good wines at a very decent price especially during their happy hours. We have been coming every Saturday afternoon for more than 2 years, never been disappointed by the venue, the drinks, the food and the smiling staff. We have been missing Emerson for the last 2 months. It was the waiter who was key to create this special atmosphere. Hope it will be back soon her
4
Essentially a wine bar but with a very good menu of tapas and main courses, the salad was delicious with an excellent vinaigrette. We had the prawns which were as good as we have had anywhere (and we live in Spain!) also had the spring chicken which was excellent.For those of you in the Clarkes quay area where there is so much fast food of iffy quality walk a little further inland on the river bank to Robertson quay, a good choice of bars and restaurants but Verre is well worth a visit
4
We wanted a beer or wine to relax and selected Verre Wine Bar just randomly as a Bar. However, The wine by glass list made us to consider also something to eat. We selected sea food pasta and scallops as portions. Suprise was really positive when the scallops were served. The portion was very nice and the scallops fresh and not overcooked. The sauce for the scallops was just amazing. Also the green side salad was fresh with sweet and vinegar taste. The food was almost unreally good for a Bar. I can highly recommend the scallops with a glass of your favourite white wine. Also need to point out the prompt and polite service.
5
This a great place to bring with your soul mate out for a romantic place for dinner or can even hang out with colleague after work for luxury gathering. You can choose the seat either indoor or outdoor. Service are too way beyond just average (excellent ). Food and wine are up to my standard and worth the price. More important last part, they still provide us a Beautiful Rose in Valentine's Day
3
The Wagyu steak and prawn with fries and salad sounded appetizing. I asked for dressing on the side, which they forgot. The fries and steak were not even warm. It was difficult to communicate with the servers. Chambolle Musigny by the glass was good but pricey. Will look elsewhere
4
The restaurant ambience is really cosy and beautiful. Great for some good couple time and also gathering with friends
5
Extensive wine collection, great selection available by the glass. Had a nice time catching up with JC classmates here.
4
Service staff is friendly. Food is great.
Ambience and atmosphere is no longer as cosy as the last time we went on a date in June 2014.
5
Environment is good.. Wine is nice.. Good recommendations from the restaurant manager.. Definitely will visit again..
5
While visiting an expat friend in Singapore, she suggested we try out Verre, a lovely little spot right on the river in the heart of Robertson Quay. Sitting outside gave us the opportunity to people watch while enjoying a great meal in the shade. We had the duck and the roast chicken, both of which were delicious. Lots of beverage options, both alcoholic and non and the best part of the night was a visit from the owners' golden retriever, whose sad sad eyes almost made me share my duck. Almost. Highly recommended for great fare and perfect ambiance
4
On a Saturday night walking along the edge of the Singapore River, I and a local friend came upon Verre and decided a French-inspired dinner was in order.The stylish wine bar (with impressive European selection inside and on the menu) was just the choice.We sat outside watching the passing parade of walkers, runners and tourists.The food was very good.A shared plate of escargots in garlic and parsley was yum.My simple tuna Nicoise salad and my friend's Angus steak were very good, with the tuna just seared and the steak meltingly good.Our desserts, a tart tart citron and the oozingly good chocolate fondant rounded out the night.Very enjoyable
5
We recently spent five days in Singapore after a cruise. We came across Verre restaurant while walking alongside the Singapore river, nestled amongst lots of other restaurants. Verre stood out from all the rest, it is a classy bistro with beautifully laid tables, rustic tableware and each table decorated with a fresh small squash, a lovely natural touch. We ate there every day and enjoyed the prawns, steak and the delicious salads. The staff were so pleasant and welcoming and did an excellent job. Even the chef came out to speak to us on our last night. A really friendly place with great staff and fantastic food. We highly recommend Verre
4
We ate at Verre on a Friday night. It was quite quiet and it was easy to get a table. The venue was reasonably plain. Service was efficient. The crowd is mainly local residences from around the area. The wine list wasn't bad. We had some light bites and wine which were pretty good and better than we expected. We will be back.
3
Has potential but too many niggles to return. Food good. Ambiance very good. Service mainly ok.Now for the niggles:- cheapest beer $14 for 300ml bottle- empty restaurant. But we had to push for our preferred table. Restaurant stayed quiet all night.- on bill we were charged for $19 wine rather than $15. "Company Policy"- extra bread charged at $5 without warning- would not mix 2f1 wines.
5
So many places to choose from in Singapore. My wife and I had a Salmon fillet grilled. A side order of asparagus and assorted mushrooms. The fish was served on potato mash with some sautÃ©ed onions. The taste was sumptuous and the service was non fuss and efficient. Mid to high price range but worth the money. Good selection of wine.
5
This bistro has been our local for nearly 2 years. We are there most of tge SaturdaysGreat and professional staff, very nice wines, happy hours, really like the atmosphere and the food. Strongly recommended for couples, family or for special events.
4
A good, quiet spot for an affordable high end meal. Nice ambience, quiet setting and very good service
3
Good attentive service. Food was alright and competently executed (I had the duck confit) but not spectacular for the price. They have a good wine collection, just that they are rather overpriced!
2
Nice location next to Singapore River, good choice of wines, incredibly incompetent and slow service! We will avoid the place.
4
Excellent restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Good French style food and wines, but not cheap.
5
Top service, awesome wines, tasty food and lovely ambiance, as always!
I'm getting used to coming here for special dinners. I've never been disappointed, quite the contrary!
I'm glad I discovered this place where you can experience top restaurant service to the western standards
4
If you are looking for great service and great food with a wine list to match Verre is the place. The menu is simple but has something for everyone definitely start with some of there platters. The service is exceptional and goes with the perfect setting. Sit outside and enjoy the experience. Make sure you book not to be disappointed. Enjo
5
We visit Verre a lot for Sunday dinner or for drinks during the week. We recently rented the entire restaurant for a special event and it was FANTASTIC. All of our guests raved about the food, atmosphere and the amazing service. We met with the chef who helped us design a special menu - mushroom confit soup served in little cappuccino cups, mini burrata tomato canapes, melon and prosciutto, followed by sliders, lobster pasta and a number of other Verre specialties. Restaurant manager Saravana and his team of servers were attentive and passionate about making our event so special and unforgettable. The chef outdid himself on all menu items including an array of fantastic homemade desserts including macaroons. Whether you're looking for a glass of wine in a nice location or a venue for a special event, I recommend Verre without reservation
4
Good place - classy and modern menu. So good selection of wine, and the waiter actually knew a lot about wine! Living in Bangkok thats become a rareity. Expensive, as everything else in Singapore. The food was good, but due to lack of some cources it was quite few dishes to select from. Overall very good, but has potential to exellent!
3
Incredibly expensive wine list : we enjoyed a bottle of Barbera d'Alba but with tax/service it was over Â£50!!! It was almost the lowest priced wine on the list as well. Served at correct temperature, good service, but fifty quid for a bottle I would pay HALF that in a central London restaurant. An indication of how Singapore is pricing itself out of reality for so many visitors driven perhaps by the misplaced association with status accorded wine drinkers locally. Get real people!!
4
We had the lamb, rib eye, fish and duck confit for main course. Beside the duck being too salty, we were satisfied with the overall of the taste. Service was attentive. Ambience was cosy and elegant.
5
First, they've got an impressive wine list for glass pour. There's delicious food (made by Michelin-starred chef), lovely chill ambiance with indoors and outdoors seating by the river, affordable prices. And most importantly, the best service one can find in Singapore
5
It was a very pleasant experience. It was a surprise birthday celebration for my partner. The staffs are very nice. :) the preped the cake as requested!
4
Impressive list of wine for glass-pour. Food and presentation well above average. Attentive service.
4
Great wine list and a good nibble menu to accompany. My only grumble was that I felt the staff were a little over zealous refilling the wine glasses. It wasn't cheap plonk and they would come along and slosh it all in. That apart can recommend :-
5
This wine bar has been around. Recently, they have upsized their menu and now have a full menu which has a range of selections across appetisers, mains and desserts. On entering the restaurant, you are greeted by high ceilings, and a glass enclosed wine cellar. There are over 150 labels in the cellar. Wine lovers will be spoilt for choice!They have indoor air-conditioned and outdoor alfresco dining areas. Outside, you can sit back and watch the boats go by, literally on Singapore River!I came by for dinner with some friends and here are the highlights: - Tarte Flambee Forest: $22. Appetisers of 'Filo-ish' pastry with button mushroom and onions which has a nice vinegrette flavour.- Chicken Liver Parfait: $24. Served in a glass jar, you scoop out some parfait and spread it over some slices of baguette. I like the Australian dehydrated mandarin orange, which was unique and nice. It pairs well with the parfait.- Half Lobster Salad: $38. Love the presentation of this dish. It's presented in a glass dome, which the nice staff lifted to present. Love the dressing and the 'guacamole' at the bottom of the dish. - Seafood Papilotte: $30. Break open the oven-baked paper bag for an irresistible aroma and the contents of cut onions, de-shelled prawns, octopus and clams in a fish broth, which absorbed all the flavors of the seafood to become a stock reminiscent of lobster bisque. In love with this. Not forgetting the bread on the side, which you can dip into the stock. Lovely. Kudos to the chef!- Black garlic soup: $19. At the bottom is a bun, layered with a sesame 'wafer' and topped with a clove of black garlic that had a caramelised vinegrette flavor. I love this.- Pan-seared lobster with sweet corn: $38. The sweet corn makes up the bottom of the plate. Garnished with cheese crisps, pop corn and espuma foam. The black konbu atop the scallops are the perfect complement to the scallops. Mildly salty and opens up the appetite.- Suckling Pig: $42. You get to enjoy 2 types of suckling pig, one roasted and one stewed in this dish. Topped with pieces of Parma ham, whole stewed onions and endives. - Lamb Chop with Moroccan couscous and mint sauce: $46. Lamb chops were done really well, with a nice searing on the outside and you get pink fat-layered meat inside. The couscous was also tasty. - Filet of Wagyu Beef: $62. Filet of Wagyu Beef with a bucket of truffle fries and forest ketchup. This was the highlight of my meal. Thick cut of beef done medium rare. The forest ketchup is house-made with mushrooms and onions. Definitely not the tomato ketchup that we know. Has a nice starchy mushroom flavor, which complements the beef. Once you start on the fries, you can't stop!For desserts, we had:- Canele: $4. Traditional recipe: Vanilla milk, dark rum, icing sugar, eggs and butter- St Honore: $10. The St Honoré was made with Pâte Feuilletée, Profiteroles and Vanilla Chantilly. I am totally in love with the Canele, which has a nice crisp exterior and you cut into it to have a soft spongy inside. Really good! - Jasmine Tea Verrine: $16. Subtle hints of Jasmine tea and I like the different textures of smooth custard and crushed ice when you put your spoon into it. too pretty to eat. - Vanilla Cheesecake: $17. This was a deconstructed cheesecake.I like the food here and the staff is more than happy to recommend wines to pair with your food, or to suit your palate for the day. Service is also good.With the cool weather these days, I might just opt to sit in the alfresco area and savour my glass of wine

While the cook allegedly worked in Michelin star restaurants, and the dishes show that, the service is far away from that standards, yet the prices are quite heavy for what you get. We were five for dinner, and we were served in intervals of 4-5 min each, so that when the last was served the first had already finished. Same story with cleaning, where dishes were taken away in the order they finished - not an issue in a casual place, but at dishes priced at this level you expect better service. Finally, had a big discussion about lamb chops that were 80-90% fat - the cook insisted this is normal, but it is the first time I got something where the edible portion is about 10% of the total. I am afraid this will not become one of my favs..
4
Surrounded by numerous other establishment this bar just has a little bit extra that makes it stand out, terrific attentive service, grea range of food and drinks that won't break the bank. Thanks to the staff for always making us welcome and see you again soon when next in town
3
It is our first visit to Singapore. We chose the Bistro for a meal as some dishes sounded similar to UK food we were familiar with. The confit of duck ordered was much as expected. The Dover Sole Citrus could not have been further from my expectations. Sole is a delicate fish and normally soft when cooked. Citrus suggested to me it was grilled and with a lemon sauce. It arrived with a dark sauce like a wine or lobster gravy. The fish was raw with slight cooking on the outside and it was also cold. I could not ear it and at 36 dollars it was expensive to throw away. Such a shame but I did not feel I could complain as it is likely to be local taste as is sushi. Just to say check it out before you order. The staff serving were excellent
5
We visited this place for the first time last night and were very impressed with the quality of the food. Everything was delicious and there was a good selection of wine. The staff was very friendly too. We had a fun night. Definitely will be back
4
Verre is in a perfect people watching location right by the river. The staff there are fantastic, always friendly and attentive, Emerson is my fave. New menu is really yummy, altho it is a little pricey, the food is always very good.
4
Another great Singapore river side restaurant service excellent food great there's not much more to say it was a great night enjoyed by all
2
staff is friendly, great location at the Singapore river;
steak frittes were cold, Salmon (although sufficiently cooked) also served cold, staff acknowledged our comments, but nothing happened
would we return: NOPE, there are better option within walking distance
5
Just walking down along the river at my last visit to Singapore, I dropped into Verre. A very welcoming and helpful waiter guided me to a nice outdoor table with a view towards the river with boats commuting up and down.A pleasant surprise was both food and wine. Perfectly prepared lamb rack and a combining delicious Bourgogne red wine rounding off with a tasty expresso made it all a great dinner experience. An excellent quiet and nice place, professional service and for sure a place to return to
4
This location is very good. The river is next to the restaurant and its peaceful unlike the more "party-like" area nearby. There are so many people who are jogging or walking their babies it gives a nice neighborhood food. Most wine places I know serve really bad food. This place is different. There is a wide menu range and pretty decent food. There are appetizers, toast (which is like thin-crusted pizza), main food etc. This is not gourmet but certainly quite good. Of course we can do small bites and share all the food
4
Verre has become a local neighbourhood restaurant for us, we eat here probably once every 2 weeks. The food is of good quality with generous proportions particularly the starters, the wine list is simple but of good quality and not the usual overpriced, mass produced commercial wine lists that are the staple of most Singapore restaurants. However the best thing about this restaurant is the wait staff, very obliging and a very capable team our thanks to Emerson who always manages to provide great service regardless of how busy the restaurant is
4
Before 7pm this place has a deal where you get 2 for 1 on glasses of wine. So instead of paying $18++ for a glass it ends up being just $9++, and there's a good selection of wines available by the glass. We also tried the seafood pizza which was quite tasty. Service was friendly and seemed genuine. A great place to take visitors from out of town
2
We walked into Verre on a Monday evening, situated in our neigbourhood, like we do more often. Our request for a nice table (four seater) inside was declined as both were supposedly reserved (around 9), even though it was past 8 pm and the place was less then half occupied. We took the cold cut platter with some additional side dishes and it proved more than decent and the tart flambee was also good. My wife ordered a kir royal, which was unfortunately made in the wrong proportions (too much crème de cassis) and partly spoiled by putting in a pink sweet amarene cherry that does not belong there. When we left at 21:15, I double checked why they hadn’t allowed us to dine at the nice table as they were both still empty and the restaurant in general was even less occupied than before. The waiter still claimed they were reserved, but the manager, who joined the conversation said that this was due to the fact that there were people sitting outside that might have to move inside if it started to rain. He said the waiter made a mistake, which was clearly not the case, and was rather embarrassing for the poor waiter. On the terrace there was one table with a group of 8 that wouldn’t have fitted the table and one with 2. When I asked why they would be allowed to sit there instead of us, he was apparently cornered and responded that 'I shouldn’t drink beer in a wine bar!! I must admit I ordered the Karmeliet beer as I (certified wine specialist) thought the wines weren’t that convincing…. In short, the service was terrible and an apology not possible. This is definitely not the standard in Singapore and as I can see from the comments not the first time. Too bad because food was good and the location excellent
4
A good place to go for a romantic dinner or just with a group of friends. The wine list is varied and we chose a tasty red and enjoyed steak frites. Afterwards we shared a plate of cheese and biscuits. Unfortunately we got charged extra for ordering a few more crackers to go with the rest of our cheese. After spending a lot on our meal and wine I really don't think that was a correct thing to do. I would defintely go back and can recommend this place- good location too
4
i don't have much things to say about this place actually. i've been here only a couple times and i think its worth it. the food is quite good actually. i had the artisanal cheese platter for starter and i ordered lamb rack, which is good. the next day i tried their black cod, which is also good. for the food i'll give a 8 out of 10. the best part about going here is their buy one get one wine deal tho.. :
5
We have been coming back to Verre for a long time (usually on monthly basis). We were impressed with the food (reasonable cost and tastes good) and the wine. Service is great especially from Saravana who recommends great tasting wine for us every time.
4
This is a good quality restaurant along riverbank pathway.Lovely setting in the evening with indoor and outdoor (preferable) seating options.Excellent menu choice and very good wine selection. Attentive and knowledgeable service from waiters. All entrees and mains thoroughly enjoyed plus desserts superb.
2
I normally read reviews before we head out to eat. But for Verre we went without reviewing online & the minute we sat down I knew it was a mistake. The young waitress had limited English & unfortunately English is all we can speak. We ordered the salmon with mash & horseradish sauce. The meal sizes can be considered big entree or smallish mains! The mash tasted 'off ' & trying to find out what was in it with the waitress was going nowhere so we asked to speak to the chef. The manager came over to explain the chef uses a process that ' gasses' the mash to make it thin & runny & not to worry because he had other complaints ( if this is so then maybe tell the chef to stop this process!!!). He agreed to take the dishes away & change the mash. He didn't have the decency to return our dishes himself instead got the front door waiter to do so. The new mash was sooo much better ! Salmon & asparagus good too. When we paid our bill there was some confusion over their happy hour deal. The manager was very upset with the young waitress for not serving us the 1 for 1 deal & said he could not just charge for 1 drink as the owner will think they have taken the money themselves. !!! He took off the amount for the cheapest of our 2 drinks ( a beer) & said "she will pay for the difference herself" pointing to the young waitress. They did try to get us to sit back down & drink our 1 for 1 happy hour deal at the end of the evening !!!! The place was almost empty. We live in Asia & understand that sometimes the service can be hit & miss but it's usually very friendly, honest & genuine - unfortunately not so at Verre.
4
I had a lovely raw salmon cappacio style on three toasts to start which was perfect followed by medium rare tuna cooked to perfection accompanied by a asparagus salad. The asparagus were unfortunately cooked how my mom cooked vegetables but that was the only little mishap. Lovely wine by the glass as wel
4
Verre is a great little wine bar located near Robertson Quay. On a recent visit to Singapore, my wife and I decided to stop in for whilst on an evening stroll along the Singapore River. As others have mentioned it has a great wine list and very attentive staff. However I concur with many of the other reviewers that the food was a little disappointing - we both had the steak & frites; with the steak a little too gristly and a touch overpriced for the offering. Would definitely recommend for an evening tipple or three but not for dining
5
Verre was a wonderful; experience. The food was expertly prepared and the wine list is world class. I really like the fact that they have 5 whites and 5 reds available by the glass that can also be ordered in 500 ml or 750 ml carafes. The 500 ml was the perfect size for my wife and me and was a great option.Just be careful about the trip advisor map for the location. The restaurant is not on Rodyk street but is in fact right on the river front
5
What a great find. Walking just a few metres from our hotel, were so happy to find Verre. The service, the food and the wine list truly amazing. The boeuf bourguignon would have to compare favourably with any version of this dish world-wide. We will certainly return and will recommend to friends who visit Singapore on a regular basis
5
Having arrived in Singapore two months ago, I had so far (I'm afraid) been somewhat underwhelmed by the quality of food. The diversity? Perfect. The price? Take your pick! But the out and out quality? Not amazing....Until my wife and I were recommended to go to Verre. OK, it was a relatively quiet evening, but the service, the food and the wine were great. We both had the steak frites, chocolate dessert, and shared a bottle of red. The service was attentive without being intrusive, the bread was fresh and tasty, and the steak was perfectly cooked. And, given the prices we have paid in Singapore so far for "Similar" meals, the bill wasn't too bad either.We will be back.A lot
5
We came here with friends after finding out that Hotel Fort Canning had no wine, no decent champagne, no food, terrible & had a wonderful night of excellent wine, magical champagne & fantastic food & altogether great service too in a happy atmosphere.Well recommended place for friends, family & romantic nights.
4
Just walking by the river last night and came across this wine bar. Small coloured lights on the table attracted us and an inviting staff member guided us to our open air table. A good selection of wines, but the food was amazing. Am definitely heading back this week. Probably for the same thing - Beef Bourginon. It was beautiful - really it was!! There were many other great things on the menu too. This was clearly a place people keep going back to. The single guy to our left had been many times and knew what he wanted, the French family to our right had been many times too and knew the staff. Definitely worth a visit. It was great and importantly the staff knew their menus, their wines and paid attention to the customer

This little gem is a great place to have a good bottle of wine in this normally overpriced city.
The winelist is pretty good and the prices are very good.
Staff do their uppmost to service you and the barsnacks is also great.
Recommended ;)

 The tarte flambée had very thin, crispy crust and just the right touch of crème and toppings. Charcuterie plate included excellent rillettes, cold cuts, all imported from France. A very fresh side salad arrived within 5 minutes after ordering. Will try the beef Bourgignon next time. I enjoyed reading the most complete list of French wines I've seen. Will definitely be back to try a few. The wines by glass were also correct. Gets our vote for best wine bar in Singapore so far.

This was my sixth visit to verre. I will come here as often as possible when I'm in Singapore. On this trip, I came four times, passing ask the nearby good restaurants to come to this great one. Had the chicken, which was moist and tender, with a crisp crust from the roasting after cooking slowly in a water bath. So good I picked up the bones and ate them clean. The rack of lamb was similarly mouth-watering. And the spinach sauce on the salmon (which I had on a bed of French fries as I am on a gluten-free diet) was an astonishing experience. Tonight I enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon, which was accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes. Every complex bite a delight.The staff is every bit as friendly as others have mentioned, as is the lovely location and convivial crowd. I cannot say enough in this space to truly do justice to this great restaurant. You must try it for yourself, if you are lucky enough to have the chance

I ordered roast chicken but on arrival found it it too rare to eat. I sent it back and the response from the kitchen was that the chef said it was fine. I asked if I could speak to the chef. He arrived promptly and without a good evening asked what the problem was. I pointed out that it was too rare, his response was that it was cooked sous verde for 14 hours and served medium rare. I reiterated it was too rare for me to consider rating it, his response was that's the way it is. Brushing aside his rudeness I was left wondering why they advertised roast chicken when they effectively poach it! Clearly not a restaurant I would trust or recommend.

Excellent wine choice, love the Happy Hour, but despite it not being full or particularly busy, the beef bourguinon and salmon rigatoni pasta my husband and I ordered took over 1 hour 15 minutes to arrive. By this point it was nearly 21:00 and everyone around us had been served their food despite ordering after us. We were repeatedly told it was on it's way by 4 staff members and asked 3 of them to bring bread or something whilst we were waiting, and eventually it arrived 1 minute before the food did. Not a great first experience, although must say the food was delicious. Would give it another try as enjoyed the ambiance and location a lot

After a week of trying Singapore's great local food we were ready for something different and stopped into Verre on impulse as we went for an evening stroll by the river. We ordered the duck on toast, mini crab and meat sliders and a side salad. All were fresh, tasty and beautifully presented. The service is friendly and attentive. Go on a dry night as the outside setting is fun and romantic
4
As other reviews have indicated, the wine list is good, the service pleasing and location excellent. Food choices are few but quality is reliable. A good option if you are looking for non-Asian cuisine. The restaurant is well air conditioned but an outside table would be a good option given the lovely location

Have been walking past Verre for a year and have often been curious. Came in tonight for a casual dinner and was delighted. Fresh and tasty food, reasonably priced, better than typical service. Will be coming back soon - had the mini burgers and chips, yu

As to be expected the excellent wines offered can be accompanied by good food; there is a very good, not to extensive, selection of western style food.By now I have worked myself through the wine and food menu and did not have a single disappointing meal. The wine by the glass menu has very good wines on it and it allows for building your own personalized dinner. This puzzle advancing the dinner is an enjoyable moment.Staff is excellent; professional and attentive.Price is moderate to high but overall very satisfying

We went to Verre last night and had a really lovely evening. My husband and I both ordered Steak Frittes with the Asparagus entre and a side salad. All the food was superb. There could have been less garlic on the asparagus and more of a mushroom sauce on the steak (the sauce was just really some mushrooms) but these were minor issues. The steak was cooked perfectly and was very tasty.The wine I ordered was excellent and the ability to order three 100ml glasses of wine for $39 was great for my husband who likes to try different wines, all of which were excellent.Would recommend it

This is a nice restaurant with a decent wine list. The food is ok but not outstanding and the menu is very limited. The ambience is what drew us in.

Go here if you are near the Grand Copthorne Waterfront area. You will have a warm welcome from Saravana

I hate to write this review, not least because Verre is right on my doorstep so I want it to be good. It also presents itself as a more upmarket establishment in an array of restaurants along the river by Robertson Walk/Quay which covers most of the spectrum. We have been three times now - the first two visits were pleasant enough without breaking any records. However our last visit was an unmitigated disaster.First of all our duck rillette starter contained a small bone. My partner then ordered the lamb chops which were severely undercooked even by classical French standards. The accompanying mashed potato was cold to begin with - and even more so after it had been left on the table whilst the chops were recooked. (Yes, the very same chops, not fresh ones.) My own steak frites was uninspiring, and even less appealing because I was left to consume it alone while my partner awaited her reheated main course.The wine list in this place is excellent - not cheap but it contains a great selection. However the food singularly fails to live up to quality of the wines on offer.Our complaints were taken seriously enough - an apology eventually came and all the food was removed from the final invoice. However my abiding feeling is not to return to Verre except possibly for drinks. Now when I leave my apartment sadly I will be walking straight past Verre and on to one of its competitors (of which there are many) in either direction along the river. I suggest other diners do the same to avoid disappointment

After dining mostly in Robertson Quay, we decided to venture beyond and stumbled into the stretch of restaurants behind Rodyk Street.Verre Wine Bar is the first restaurant we met on our stroll from Robertson Quay. Sporting a pleasant environment, we decided to give it a try. Our original intention was to sit outdoor and soak in the wonderful atmosphere amid the setting sun. Unfortunately, seats were unavailable and we were ushered indoors. Dog lovers may like this place as we saw two handsome Golden Retrievers with their owners basking in the breezy evening.Our orders were taken briskly and while sipping our glasses of 2011 Vina Sardasol (merlot), the service staff were kind enough to offer us outdoor seats that were vacated. Full points for their attention to details and customers' request.We had the Beef Bourguignon and Steak Frites (rib eye steak) accompanied with lobster bisque as the starter. All of them are nice and delicious. Starting first with the bisque, it was delightful. The quantity was just sufficient without weighing down your appetite for the mains. The use of thinly stripped bacon and making it very crispy as toppings is class!The bourguignon are beef cheeks nicely stewed in red wine and some nice vinegar sauce while the steak taste great when done at medium rare.We would have gone on for the recommended lava cake or baked pineapple but had to leave that for another day.Definitely worth a second visit

After traipsing along Rodyk Street a couple of times, we finally settled on Verre Wine Bar for an evening meal. We were impressed with the welcome we received from the staff and found the ambience just right for a relaxed meal. Being a pretty warm evening, we opted for an indoor table and weren't disappointed with the comfort and atmosphere the dining room. The menu had a good range of choices and what we settled on, the Beef Bourbegnon and the Rack of Lamb, was some of the best food we've enjoyed for some time. The portions were not over-sized, leaving room for a delectable desert to complete the meal. The staff members were helpful and attentive, but not overbearing in their attention. The only down-side was the price, and we had fallen for the fact that prices listed on the menu, excluded GST and the service charge - something to watch for in Singapore

I have walked by many times, but decided to stop in this time. There is a gentle atmosphere with cozy seats. The food menu is limited but that makes it easier to choose. I tried the crab burger that came presented as three sliders on a rectangular tile. They were tasty and nicely garnished as described on the menu. It went down nicely with a glass of wine. No regrets stopping in this evening and the kitchen is open late.

We visited Verre by chance, was walking along side Robertson Quay to have dinner with my boyfriend and both decided to try it cuz it looks nice and quiet.He ordered steak frite and I did the beef bourgignon. Total quality food and the taste was just right! The mashed potato that came with my beef was really really good, best I had. My beef is very tender and cooked properly. His steak was tender and delicious.We also had white wine which was also really good.Overall experience was lovely, we love the atmosphere. The best dinner we had on the 3 days of our weekend getaway

Singapore is a hot place, this establishment only has Belgium beers, which whilst are most enjoyable, are not designed for that climate, and are not as thirst quenching as are some other beers. Our meals were cooked well enough but the Roasted Salmon on a bed of Asparagus was found lacking, a side of Couscous or Garlic mash would have complimented the meal. Our Rack of Lamb whilst cooked to perfection and served well, was a STACK of Lamb Chops and NOT a Rack of Lamb. The wait staff were attentive but their job is made difficult by a disjointed food and drinks menu

I have dined at Verre many times and the food is consistently good. The menu is limited but the ingredients are incredibly fresh and tasty. I particularly like their salads (especially duck and nicoise) and if you just want to nibble on something you can get their cheese and cold cuts plates. Their beef bourgignon is also delicious. The staff is extremely nice and attentive; ask them to show you their wine cellar: you will be impressed. And the location is clearly unbeatable

This really is an excellent stylish restaurant/wine bar, with a wonderful casual and relaxed ambience. The menu is created by a French chef with a fusion-style menu and an outstanding wine list; and if you arrive before 7pm, lucky you, it's happy hour. The staff are delightful, the setting is gorgeous. (Don't be put-off by the spruiking staff out front, I think it's a Singapore thing, as they are polite, helpful and friendly). Great place to sit and observe a little bit of the local Singaporeans, with the activities of the river as a backdrop

Brilliant location - next to river in Robertson Quay. I had Salmon as my Main. The food was good. They have a great wine selection.

We had dinner here twice and both times the food was cooked exactly as we asked for and the service was quick without being rushed

Visited this wine bar a couple of times and I must say the quality of the wine and food is very good.... Staff is nice, friendly and always helpful....

Fun place right on river.Like all restaurants in this area has a long happy hour. Good drinks and food,staff very friendly.

Very nice place and quiet location.perfect terrace near the river. Perfect to relax and chill out.good food quality with reasonable price. But the must is the wine list ! (Do not hesitate to ask the sommelier to help you with your choice)We will definitely go back and test the cheese platter.Charles

This wine bar has a great happy hour 4-6 weekends & 5-7 on weekdays. It includes all wine,cocktail and even champagne. The food is really good, would recommend the rack of lamb which we had twice. It occupies a lovely spot on the riverside promenade with shade from the sun under the trees if you need it. It also has an indoor eating area & bar. Staff are really friendly and it attracts local singaporeans aswell as expats. Main courses were around $12/15 but there is also smaller/tapas style dishes if you dont want a full meal

This was one of my favorite meals during our honeymoon. Excellent recommendation of wine paired with an exquisite selection of French style bites. Great value for money. A must have experience if you visit Singapore! The Foie Gras with roasted figs and balsamic reduction was the best I have had in awhile - kudos to the chef! Thanks Verre for an amazing experience :

There is a great deal on early week here where if you buy a glass of wine you can get 2 small plates and a main course! Seems like a great idea except the volume of food is high and the quality is very hit and miss......Great location and atmosphere but the food was so so disappointing......the wine list is good.......but they did also manage to not apply the special deal to our bill so watch out for that too!On a bright note my mate was paying so that lessened the pain slightly

I had been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed the food and wine. The wine list is very extensive and the venue has a relaxed feeling. The service has always been incredibly slow but the food and wine more than make up for it or at least it did until my last and final visit. It took 30 minutes to get our wine after a 15 minute wait for our order to be taken. After we ordered, it took an hour and twenty minutes for our main and that was only after asking twice. I might add there were 5 people in the restaurant at that time and it was not busy. There were three staff serving who seemed more interested in looking at themselves in the mirror or admiring their window dressing skills. I noticed people had finished and even after paying the bill and leaving, their plates were still on the tables. In short it was a disgrace, the main course was frozen in the middle and when I complained it was ignored. I asked to speak to a manger and when he arrived proceeded to tell me it was not his fault there was a member of staff on sick leave. His attitude to the service and the food was, "well you have been here many times before so whats the problem with it not being good this evening" !. We paid the bill in full and left, had he demonstrated some concept of customer service we may well have returned. No idea on how to handle service recovery or service in general, won't be open too long if this continues

I have been passed this place befor, but finally stopped in. I was amazed at the extent of the wine list, as well as the enthusiasm of the waiter and his interest in wines. But it didn't end there...I had a wonderful dinner of Sea Bass that was something out of Provence. I will be back.
