Before checking out a movie, we dropped by the house of pancakes. We managed to get good savoury vegetarian options. I found my flap jacks very good both in amount and taste. A vanilla smoothie to drown it down, was fantastic (plus some ice water).

Every type of pancake you desire from savoury to sweet and desert and all the fillings. Really good menu tasty food and friendly manager. Very enjoyable meal in nice clean surroundings . Reasonable prices. Recommended.

Paddington has selection from classic to burger all in one roof. Crepes are available in sweet or salt cooking.
Love all selection. Ambiance is really good. Not much to appraise service as most staffs look very inexperienced.
Great place for relaxing weekend.

An extensive variety of pancakes imaginable for your choosing, that you will be at loss on what to order! They also offer pasta and appetisers. My personal favourite is the mix of wedges & fries topped with cheese and bacon bits. Yummy!

We had a wonderful brunch here with our kids choosing pancakes and chicken spaghetti bolognese - go figure. The pancake menu is quite extensive and our group chose both American style fluffy pancakes and Dutch pannekoek which are more like sweet crepes. French style savory crepes were also on offer. The menu also offers non-pancake breakfast and lunch options and the spaghetti bolognese was a hit with our kids. As a bonus, the coffee is also quiet good. The bill, which I’ve attached, shows our purchases and you’ll see that the meal wasn’t exactly cheap, especially for an in-mall choice with little atmosphere. But all things considered, a good family option. Enjoy

Had dinner here a week ago. I had the "Nice" pancake as a main course and some stacked ice-cream pancakes for desert. They were very tasty, smelled incredible and looked even better. The service was great ! I would have given it a perfect score if it wasn't so pricey, 70$ for 2 main courses, 2 small stacks, and 2-3 drinks

I came with my small boy and they immediately brought a child seat, plastic plates and cutlery. They gave him a lot of attention - the problem was that they brought him some sweets, which he loved, but made him refuse to eat any food afterwards. It was a sweet gesture though. The pancakes themselves were good (blueberry with cream cheese), but I didn't care for the scrambled eggs or the milk shake which were not very nice.

The service staff is unbelievably blunt and unhelpful. It's as if I had to beg for assistance. We ordered some savoury crepes as well as their signature pancakes. Let's be honest, it was nothing short of disappointing. Everything felt artificial, cold, undesirable and not worth your time / money. The service staff added onto the displeasure of the food by being arrogantly unhelpful. The nail into the coffin was when the bill came. Ridiculous prices charged for disappointing flapjacks. Word to the wise - head elsewhere for your pancake cravings.

Excellent batter! My friends and I tried from all the different types of pancakes and we simply love them all. Appetisers such as 'Lots of Dollars' has the right mix of sweet and savoury which you will enjoy very much. The wedges and fries as well as nachos are so delectable. The sun-dried tomato dip accompanying the nachos is an excellent compliment. We tried Vienna (chicken franks with a sour, peppery tomato based sauce), simple and delicious comfort food. We also had the crepe with chicken fillet and prawns of which the sauce was excellent! For dessert, we had the crepe with banana fritters which was accompanied by a superb salted caramel sauce that compliments the banana fritters, whipped cream and crepe very well. The blueberry cheesecake stack is a must to order when you're there to dine, as the taste is light and so delightful. Lastly, we had the banana, peanut butter sort of layered crepe combination that cannot go wrong. A very happy place to be at especially if you like pancakes!!!

Find the pancake rather bland for my liking... Though there's syrup, ice cream, strawberry & cream to compliment the pamcake, I still think it's not good enough... The flavour should be in the pancake as well... A more buttery taste will be good...

Overpriced for the quality and quantity, we ordered 2 salty pancakes, they had no taste and we were still hungry after them we had 2 soft drinks, the bill was over 50S$, for this price we could have so much better elsewhere... Very disappointing

Had eaten at one of their branches across the Causeway, so decided to give it a try as we were looking for dessert after dinner at the also-Malaysian Face to Face noodles joint which was opened in the same building.My wife ordered the blueberry pancake while I had the sated caramel with peanut butter sundae. My sundae arrived first, within 15 minutes, and it was chock full of whipped cream. There was too little salted caramel while the peanut butter was nice. There were a few pieces of sliced bananas, which were okay, but the dollar pancakes were soggy and very thick after being immersed at the bottom of the cup.The short stack of blueberry pancakes were nice and fluffy when they arrived but quickly became floury in taste and rather dry. The accompanying generic vanilla flavoured ice cream was a generous scoop, but did not add much in terms of taste to the dish.Service was okay, and they were slightly rushed off their feet as it was the peak of dinner time.They do serve water at 30 cents per cup, which was okay. Otherwise we would have been overloaded with sugar if we had to order one of the shakes, lattes or juices. If yiu want dinner, they do serve savoury dishes such as galettes, pastas and burgers

Went with a friend for brunch. Ordered Oslo, Hot Latte and Strawberry New York Cheesecake for myself. Oslo portion was alot. Can be shared for two paxs. I was unable to finish my dessert : Strawberry New York Cheesecake as I was still feeling full with the Oslo plate. Awaiting was about 20mins, but understandable as you won't want your pancakes to be served cold. Their pancakes were not like those add water with instant mixer type. Will visit again BUT its either to order dessert or to have their main course

What had started out as a happy cousins' meal together ended on a very sour note.It was a frustrating 20-minute wait for pancakes that were barely warm and had too much flour, especially when food was served to other tables that arrived later than us. Also, there was a wrong order of ice-cream accompanying one of the pancakes. When feedback was given to the outlet manager, he was not receptive, became highly defensive and did not have the initiative to apologize for the disappointing experience or offer any compensation. By comparing the dining experience of the restaurant to McDonald's and saying that the restaurant cannot meet the expectations of the customer, this is highly unacceptable. I am appalled that the manager spoke in such a rude manner to us customers.We will definitely not revisit. This is our first and last time here.Food: 2 / 5Service: 1 / 5Price: 2 /

Honestly i enjoyed the food in this restaurant. The quality of food is just perfect , nothing to complain. The chefs are very professional and the staff as well.I need to just add 2 things.-The price is very expensive and i dont think anyone of customers will come back again with those prices even if they are satisfied with the food. -The power juice combination of avocado , kiwi and apple wasn't tasty and it needs some improvement.Dinner 28.01.201

We had the Monaco (French Crepe with Chicken and Mushroom Sauce) and Provence (Lamb Chops with Pancakes) and we absolute loved it! Each plate was just nice, not too filling, and the taste of each dish was familiar yet unique because of the pancakes. We will definitely go back again if we're in the area.

With the family and being Sunday, we thought this might be a nice place for brunch. With the recent halal-certification, we just had more reasons to check this place out. Though there are so many variety of pancakes, both sweet and savoury, it was not that impressive after all. Some of the pancakes and crepes were tasteless and the meat was bland. Prices were quite on the higher end and it was not worth it. Even the water was charged for 30 cents a cup. Paid about $140 for 7 people excluding drinks. Disappointing

Yes, they do offer a great variety of pancakes and crepes. But, in the race of making pancake burgers and coin pancake they missed on the flavor a big time. The food was very bland. If i go there again will be only if i want to have the normal fluffy pancakes with butter :)Since I am vegetarian, i had to ask the staff of what will they suggest for me, but sadly the service staff had to go back to the kitchen again and again to ask what to suggest us. It took 20 minutes to order and we ordered so called their Veg speciality as per the service staff lady but still were disappointed

Paddington House of Pancakes has a menu that will take you a while to get through - it's a mini book! They have crazy variety - the good thing is that they also have brief explanations of the different kinds on pancakes they offer.We had the Florence, a thin 12", which came topped with eggplant, sun dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, olives, basil, mozzarella. It was light and nice - the only downer was the eggplant which wasn't roasted uniformly, so there were a few raw patches. We also got the Hawaiian filled stack as dessert - came stuffed with peaches and coconut, garnished with coconut flakes, and a scoop of Vanilla ice cream dusted with cinnamon. It was hearty, delicious, and not too sweet.To drink, we had an Iced cap and Iced chocolate - both were really good. The chocolate was every bit of sinful as its name suggested.The food was pretty good, the service was efficient, and the staff friendly. I'd like to give it a shot again

I have heard about this place from my friends and i have always wanted to try it. So i went down all the way from jurong with my boyfriends just to try it out. The interior of the restaurant is very nice with a lot of lights on the ceiling. I sat near the window so that i could see the view on the other side.When i first take a look at the menu i could not decide what i wanted to eat because there were so many variety of food that i would like to try.When i finally ordered the staff was very friendly and approachable. We waited for our food to arrive and it took about 15mins. Food looks good and tasted as good as it looks. Overall i would recommend this place to my friends and i would definitely come back to try for more.

Loved this pancake house. Extensive menu with every possible topping on the pancakes.The staff are not fussy and you can change your pancake to how you like it without being restricted by the combinations in the menu.The food is complimented by excellent drinks. The milkshakes and fraps are really well made.I had the classic breakfast combination which had blueberry pancakes with a cream cheese filling in the middle, scrambled eggs and chicken ham.So good

I have been to Paddington several times but I have to say my feeling towards this place is mixed. there is once which I waited for more then half an hour when asked was shocked to know they have mixed up or forgotten my order. Oh well I decide to give it another try and I would have to say the service have improved. There was a waiter (Indian) that took our order and the way he does it was so rush and the speed that he read out our order again was like a machine gun and it the end I would say none on our table really understand what he is saying. The drinks arrive and I would have to comment it was nice, a mix of melon and mint but the only fault I can say is that is too sweet. However, most of the people on the table think is still great. Since we just had our Tim Sum we decided to order two desserts to share. The pancakes I would say was nice and soft and fluffy. the overall combination was great. We all liked what we have. Halfway through our meal we were asked for last order by a nice cheerful lady which we really appreciate her effort to bring us water despite us having finished our meal and drinks. It was a nice thing to have to wash down the sweetness of the drinks and since is last order I regret not ordering something more.Previously A Fillipino Waiter came to ask if we need anything for last order as we told him we already did inform. He I would say is not very friendly in the way he asked. So it was not a nice feeling. However our mood was brighten up by the same lady that enquire about our meal and anything feedback we like to give. It strange that in one restaurant there is such a vast difference in terms of service. so in summery I would say : Pancakes above average but the price isnt. in total for 1 drink and 2 pancakes we need to fork out 50 bucks is rather expensive. Unless I have a big craving I dont think I will visit this place often

If you are a pancakes lover you will love it. But too much of it you might not enjoy it. Good to order to share as the portion will make you full if you are going to eat alone.I find it was a bit sweet for the chocolate sauce. Overall I still prefer just simple pancakes or waffles. Give a try and you will know it

This is my first time to visit Paddington House of Pancakes but it just became my new favorite restaurant. Simply delicious! The food was delicious. I had the "Oslo" (a very generous portion of aliced salmon on top of 2 potato pancakes with an excellent Spanish omelet,as well as carrot juice. I know I will be back soon

Food tasted okay. The cheese fries is a fail, don't order that. Hmmm... think it's not as great as I expected it to be.Service - mixed. The Caucasian lady was super nice to us, checking on us and asking how our dinner was but the Filipino guy was kind of cold and almost sort of rushing, even though it wasn't a busy night. Ambiance also okay. Comfortable. Not at all crowded even for a Friday night. So a relatively quiet place that you can have conversations with your date, friends or family. Not the best pancake restaurant around though

Place was nice, we loved pancakes so we just went into this restaurant. First of all, service was initially good, a lady served us, from there on, we wanted to ask for a plate, the lady was not available so a guy, Indian/asian attended to us, he walked halfway, heard what we wanted and walked away, he then asked the waitress who was busy to serve us, the second time was billing time, he was busy laughing with another caucasian lady who looked like a manager, once he saw us his face turned black, we could see that he was extremely lazy.Food was bland, the treasure dish with pancake, fruits and icecream was not very nice, pancake was too warm and all tucked underneath the bowl, which caused the icecream to melt and pancake to turn sticky, the fruits was kinda unripe and sour

Feels like a new restaurant. Ordered some pancakes and they were nice! But that's where the nice things end.The service has room for improvement. When our pot of tea came, we had to ask for sugar and they gave us 4 strips. Then we realised we needed small tea spoons and asked again. When the food came, I waited a while and realised Hmm how do we eat them. So i asked for cutlery. It's just unlike a typical restaurant when the servers are very familiar with what they need to do and you don't get a chance to stand up and ask. Also I couldn't understand the English of some of the waiters. Sugar packets should just be left on the table for us to use if necessary. My family felt they were very stingy with sugar ...

Honestly speaking, i just knew that pancakes have different varieties.My idea of pancakes just blew away after i visited Paddington.I tried the healthy version with buckwheat flour as a pancake base. The paper depth and crispy pancake reminds me of thin pizza.Mozarella cheese, and sumptuous filling of chicken meat and egg are surprisingly quite fulfilling the stomach.The service was also good, and they serve ice water for free.If you wanna try the varieties of pancakes, from sweet and savoury, it is a must to try House of Paddington at city square
