British style pub on East Coast road, good location and good place to hang out. Opposite i12 shopping mall, holiday inn express, hotel indigo and katong village hotel so very convenient for a stop off.Normally just go there for drinks but the food there is also quite good, many of the same things on the menu as sister restaurant Rabbit Carrot Gun next door. The steak sandwich and the scotch egg are quite good. A few seats outdoors and then more seating inside.The place is not large and can fill up quite quickly in the evening. Makes for a lively atmosphere which is quite enjoyable. There are 2 TVs for watching sport. Went to visit the other day to watch the state of origin NRL. The rugby is on an internet service which freezes every now and again, this kind of detracted from the atmosphere and one poor patron had to keep resetting the internet box.Will keep coming but maybe choose a different venue for the rugby
