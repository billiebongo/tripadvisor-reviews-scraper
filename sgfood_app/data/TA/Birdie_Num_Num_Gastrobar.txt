Love this place, and their food! Heard they have a new bbq menu but I could not try it yesterday as it was just evening drinks with friends. I’ve been here a few times and it’s always great.

Great food and beer. Good experience and service. Would recommend and come again. Indoor seats quite limited.

A homely place serving bar grub and beer at great pricing. Service was very personable and excellent. The food was average. I highly recommend the miso cod. It was the best dish we had that night.

Have been there twice, and each time is a pleasant surprise! Ordered the must-eat foie gras and steak for both visits and they don’t disappoint. The sinful fries and duck fat fries will make you crave for more! The drinks are reasonably priced, tagged with Auntie Rose’s (owner) smiles! Visit, and you will love the place

With so many pubs in the local area its hard to distinguish yourselves from the rest especially with price wars on beer prices but what Birdie Num Num has been able to do is offer such good food options its hard to go anywhere else. The food is pub grub but of the highest order. The duck fat fries are a must! Chicken wings are super spicy but so moreish! Miso cod and salmon are healthier options. The Birdia burger also rock! You can see I like this place, I've been through the menu on a number of occasions as its my favourite local. Beer prices are extremely competitive, my favourite tipple there is the Asahi which was $10 a pint on my last visit

Visited this place recently after passing it a couple of times. We order beer and finger food, namely chicken wings and fat dick fries. The chicken wings were good but the fries were a little too oily for us.One thing unique here is that the owners seemed to know their guests, and make effort to engage them, and the support from guests can be seen from a full house on a Thursday night. Two thumbs up for this family run pub.

Only had a pot of chamomile tea and apple juice so unable to rate the food. Was only there for a drink. Service was decent and we didn't feel pressured to order more food. Nice small cozy place to chill. Will be back to try the mains next time.

It’s near the station, food is great and nice ambiance. Love the way they cooked the baby back ribs, rich taste! It was nice to eat food while listening to upbeat music. Will be back soon! Try the baby back ribs and the 4-cheese pizza!! Excellent!

Duck fat fries and miso cod were so delicious. The bacon scallops were pretty alright, as I found the bacon too fatty and the scallops too soft and undercooked. Great beer promos and a lovely atmosphere, staff also generated great service.

The place is cosy and suitable for drinks. Finger good is also tasty. No additional taxes/service charge.

Went for dinner after reading good reviews of this gastrobar, and tried some of the recommended dishes. It was a huge disappointment - fries cooked in duck fat was over salty and the blob of melted cheese on top turned the fries soggy. The duck confit was super greasy and the chocolate souffle tasted more like a disguised lava cake. The best thing I had for dinner was the passion fruit cider...

Went to try this gastrobar last nite. End up being very disapointed with the quality of food served contrary to the reviews i saw.The tiny scallops rolled in bacon are tasteless and the dish do not correspond to the picture on their site. The duck Confit was salty. The steak arrived cold at the table ( had to be sent back to the kitchen) as well as the accompanying potatoe gratin...(About half of the steak was composed of fat )The fries in duck fat were salty ,soggy and mushy...The ice cream accompanying the good chocolate lava was over suggary.I wonder if the chef was there last night

We had the miso cod, topshell with Thai sauce, fries in duck fat, and bone marrow with cheese. The place was 3/4 full at 7.30pm, we had no trouble getting a table and service was quick.The miso cod was very tender and the accompanying steamed vegetables were very well-cooked. The topshell was sliced thinly with shreds of raw onion and covered in Thai chilli sauce - very appetizing but those with spice tolerance should steer clear. The fries with duck fat was disappointing as they were a recommended dish, but they felt too soggy and didn't taste rich. Lastly, the bone marrow - I'm a big fan of marrow and was happy with the doneness of the dish. However the cheese layer was too salty and I stripped it to go with the accompanying toast instead
