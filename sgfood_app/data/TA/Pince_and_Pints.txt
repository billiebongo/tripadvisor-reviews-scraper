Very nice and fresh lobsters! We had lobster roll and set lunch which is just right for the 2 of us. Attentive service too!
5
Value for money serving and the lobster was so fresh. The whole serving is just nice for my tummy. Will come here again when i visit SG next time.
4
Came here for lunch when i managed to buy chope vouchers at a discount. Otherwise it would have been too expensive.
Lobsters were fresh but they took abt 30-45 min to come, even when the place was only any 30% full.

Was recommended by a friend that this is a good place so we booked a table for 6pax on 21 Feb, 8pm. Ordered 6 main courses, a seafood platter, A dozen Oysters & Mussels & Lobster Chowder. Oh and a bottle of Riesling too. Loved the Mac & cheese as the portion is good. Tried the Chilli Lobster but finds the sauce too starchy for my taste. The mixed seafood platter is a disappointment as the deep fried calamari was dry and tasteless. The mussels we had didn’t taste too fresh either. My 2 friend has lobster roll & truffle roll which was not too bad. Lobster chowder was served lukewarm. Felt that it wasn’t hot enough. Overall, the dining experience was marred by the rude service of a Malay male staff that night who looked uninterested or can’t be bothered sort of attitude. Eg. when the food arrived at the table, he kinda shouted “Who ordered Lobster roll!!” His lack of attentiveness and that pissed-off face thru out our 1.5hours there makes it unbearable for all of us as we only wanted to have a good time to celebrate two of my best friends birthday. At one point ,we even had to get up and pour the remaining wine ourselves. This lack of attention to details & service level is definitely undesirable by any standard. And not mention at such high prices for the main. At least we should be getting some kind of service. With that bitter taste in the service rendered, we were eager to finish up ASAP and leave. ☹️ Not a place I’ll recommend unless they do something about that bad service. The place wasn’t even packed to begin with.Vic Foo & friends SG

Served by a friendly guy. Intro us the recommended dishes and in the end, ordered a Lobster Roll and Mac & Cheese. Lobster roll was good, the sauce that was provided with Lobster Roll was not sufficient for me to dip the fries. The fries that they used is “steak” fries or thick-cut fries which makes it not that crispy or crunchy compared to standard cut fries. It will be good if there is a choice for customers to choose which kind of fries they prefer to make it a plus point. Lobster roll was cut into half for easier eating which is also a plus point as I can pick up from the plate and eat it! Mac and cheese was good! Portion is sufficient enough for 2 to share if both sharing pax appetite is not huge

Lobster dishes at either $58++ or $68++. Satisfying food. But overpriced for sure - recipes did not deserve their price tags, I feel. Atmosphere also very much like a bar (well, it is in the name) - so more suitable for a squeezy friends' night out with loud pop music than a romantic couple's lobster dinner on VDay. The truffle butter sauce is delicious though. Yum. Service - nothing special. 3/
4
Second time here. Crowd was lesser than my first time here. Perhaps because it was quite early, Food is good as usual. However service was a bit lacking on that day. Waiter's behavior looked pissed off since the very beginning, which kinda ruined the mood of the day
2
We were greeted by two staff that seems uninterested the moment we stepped in the restaurant. We had to wait for a while before we could get the attention of the staff to place order and even to make payment. The bread of the truffle lobster roll was clearly over grilled. Traces of oil could be seen in the bread. Staff did not even bother to check back on our food considering that it is our first time visit.

Visited the Katong branch with my Wife about 2 weeks ago. Bill came to approx $350 after ordering 1 lobster thermidore, 1 lobster role, 1 calamari, 1 lobster mac & cheese, 1 orange juice ($5, came from a box) and 1 cocktail. Good: Mac & cheese was the best dish we had. Serving of lobster was generous in the lobster role (better be at $58). Quality of lobster in all dishes was very good.Bad: restaurant finishing and atmosphere was really poor and cheap quality - doesn’t match the exorbitant fine-dining like prices. Service tries hard so thumbs up for the great attitude but is a bit awkward & poorly trained. Lobster thermidore is not a thermidore at all - thermidore should be creamy, this is dry with a crust of breadcrumbs and parmesan on top, which I suspect didn’t come out as intended. The flesh was also incredibly dry. Waste of good lobster.Won’t be back
3
We ordered a lobster roll and chilli lobster along with 2 glasses of wine - that still left us with hungry stomachs. Dishes were quite small for the price paid. Nonetheless chilli lobster is quite a special dish to try in Singapore along with the fried mantou (although the chilli crab sauce was so-so). Seats were quite cramped so don’t expect to have a long dinner there
5
Great food, great service and great ambience! The steamed lobsters were very fresh and they allowed two portions of salads if you do not want fries. But their lemon butter sauce can be too buttery for liking.
4
Enjoyed the food which was yummy but, pricey. Will only go back if there's good discount vouchers by chope
5
The lobster were awesome, and this is our 3rd time that we are coming back to the restaurant. With the chope voucher, it was even more worth it.
4
Quintessential lobster restaurant bar at Duxton road which serves lobster meals only. Recommended to try the lunch set menu which comes with a drink and dessert
4
Food quality was great, probably due to the small seating size hence I feel that the lobster and chips tastes much more flavourful than Burgers and Lobsters. Chilli lobster and lobster rolls are really very good! Lychee ice tea was also to order list!However lobster noodle was mediocre.  Do not understand the full attendance sitting policy. I have made reservation , table was empty when I went in. I ordered a fries but I felt like an unwanted child eating the fries outside of restaurant while waiting for my friends =_= Servers were professional but hopefully could serve a bit with a smile.
4
Went on a weekday night and book via chope. Lobsters were really freshhhh! Two of the female staffs were so attentive and quick to respond to our needs. THANK YOU!! One male staff (looks like manager?) was a little rude, he put down the drinks with a big bang..? Did we own him money? Hmm... but other than that, it's a good experience :)
2
Went there for the first time with friends to celebrate friend's birthday. I had high hope for that place since I heard so much about it especially the lobster roll. Well, it turned out to be such an over-rated restaurant both on the food and drinks. We ordered 4 different kinds of lobster and among the 4, chilli crab was the best.
1
Went there at 6.45pm, though my reservation is at 730pm, I asked if we could sit and order drinks first while waiting for 1 of our Friend. Waiter said nope, cause your table is not ready and reservation is at 730pm, you can sit outside if you want.The restaurant was completely empty. We went back at 720pm and placed our orders, service given by the ladies was ok. Bad service from the guys and host. They worked like they hate their job. With that kind of price tag, Iâ€™d gladly spent it elsewhere.

Have tried the outlet at Katong (Opp 112 Katong mall) due to reservation full at Duxton.We have the Lobster roll, Live Whole Lobster steam, Lobster noodle and Chilli Lobster with Mantou. Each had its own speciality taste. The Live Whole Lobster can choose between Steamed or Grilled, we chose steam to get the fullest out of the freshness of the lobster. The Chilli lobster us spicy and very appetizing. It go perfectly well with the mantou. *A bowl of rice would make it better for me.The lobster noodle come with sambal chili. For people that like E-fu noodle, this is the perfect dish.For the Lobster roll, the serving is just right for lady. Overall Experiencing Lobster overdose. The overall satisfaction is
4
Third time coming back to Pince & Pints, and would come back again! Both my husband and I had the grilled lobster, which goes well with the butter sauce that comes with it. The size of the lobsters served seems to have shrunk a little though, which is slightly disappointing. Experience-wise, the wait staff could be a little more cordial, and the bathrooms can definitely be improved! The exhaust fumes seem to be emptied into the bathroom area so the smell lingers on your clothes a little after.
4
Good experience, food was good too. However service can be further improved. Waiters keep drop our food.
4
Lobster burger is especially good! Good ambience and entertaining staff. Sweet potato fries is good!
1
Customer service is very important. I had a very bad experience with the staffs in this restaurant. Chilli lobster sauce is tasteless. Go at your own risk lololol
5
Fresh lobster with well buttered buns, went there with a cousin of mine. I still remember his happy face while savouring the rolls. What more could we asked for!
4
Food was yummy, though there was a small lobster shell in the lobster roll. Service was awesome. Spent around $120 for 2 pax. Only for special occasions
4
Food is good. Service is good. Happened to have a big table beside us and was quite noisy as the space was confined.
4
We went on a weekday and the lobsters were nicely cooked and the lobster roll was surprisingly tender and tasty. Although disappointed that water is now charged.
5
Lobster was really fresh as we chose grill option.fries tasted real potato and is soft inside,crispy outside.starters are good too! We ordered calamari,we smell salted egg yoke but there wasn't.crispy but not oily,squid is very fresh
5
LOVE the mac & cheese (with lobster of cos) which was a surprise as it was a side accompanying our mains. Mains were well-cooked - the lobster roll was well buttered and seasoned. All in all a really good meal. Nice restaurant with an comfortable environment.
4
The lobster roll is really good. One of the better ones you can find in Singapore. My only complain is that the sweet potato fries is too soggy, very dissapointing. Lobster can also be in bigger portion? Like what you can get overseas. Taste wise food is good
4
Pince and Pints is a nice place to try different sea type of sea food. very fresh and clean restaurant.
3
Service and environment were good! Just disappointed with the Lobster, ordered the Lobster Thermido and the lobster meat wasn’t fresh, meat were soggy.. Lobster burger also dry.
5
Amazing rum and pisco cocktail recipes to test!!!
And I discover that lobster and cheese can be very tasty “Lobster mac & cheese “ !!!
4
nothing more to consider when you come here. the lobster roll is a must-try. Albeit on the expensive side, but worth the time to come here to savour the tasty lobster roll.
4
Fresh lobsters, always a good meal! Love the steamed lobster! Now that we can reserve a table, it's much more convenient!
3
Was glad that I made a reservation to dine as it became a full house later on that Saturday night I visited. Lobsters were really fresh, they even help deshell the claw for my thermidor. Note that they don't serve tap water, so just save the effort from asking and order from their drink menu.
1
We had grilled lobster and lobster roll at their Katong outlet. The food was fine, lobster a bit undercooked and not much favour. Salad was fresh and delicious. The resturant has two storey, normal bistro ambience on the ground floor with a bar. Service was efficient, but staff is not well trained and grossly under staff on the dinning floor. The see through kitchen should be covered as it was not that clean and pleasant to watch. It was about >$80 per head for a meal plus drink. Given the ingredient, it is fare value. What I was shocked is that they do not serve tap water at all, even when we are willing to pay for it. Only bottled mineral water. Don't they care about the negative environmental impact of bottled water? I will not return until they offer tap water. A matter of principle
3
We were off to a bad start, when told that we could not buy tap water. We refuse to buy water that has been transported half way around the globe, when Singapore has some of the best tap water in Asia. Paying for the tap water is not the point, but availability is. They serve tap water in 3 star michelin restaurants!We ordered a grilled lobster and a lobster roll, both were good, and the lobster was a good size, however the salad and chips portions were too small, so you really need to order a starter as well, and then it become more expensive.The glass separating the kitchen from the restaurant needs to be clean
3
Went on a friday evening, not full house but the staff called to confirm my resevation. The staff then came over to take order, when we said we needed more time, he just stood behind and waited. The restaurant does not serve warm water, the waiter does not provides alternative when I requested for non caffeine warm drinks and simply walk away
4
I went with my boyfriend for a nice meal. The ambience is really good for a romantic dinner. I ordered the truffle lobster roll while he had the steamed whole lobster. For the price we paid, I think the whole lobster is much more worth it and because it was steamed, it was realy juicy and we could taste the freshness of the meat!
4
Ordered the different lobster dishes and all tasted good! Lobsters are very fresh. Would highly recommend chili lobster :) The staff is also very friendly! A good place for gatherings :)
4
Food portion sizes have been declining over the years. Still tastes good but overall value has definitely fallen.
4
Food is nice but slightly expensive. Service staffs are polite and friendly. Hope to see more new creations on the menu next time!
3
Overall the experience was not bad. The food was absolutely fantastic although the price is on the high side. The customer service can be improved further. If I were to go back again, it would probably be for their food!
3
Lobster size abit smaller than expected. Taste good. Service slow. Went at 1130am. Stood at the door for a while before I managed to catch their attention. 3 chefs busy talking to each other.
3
The lobsters bare definitely the main attraction. Give all sides a miss, trust me. You wouldn't regret.
Staff look expressionless but otherwise, it's average waiting service.
2
The guy waiter was rude when he came to our table to ask for our orders. Bad attitude and impatient. Music was way too loud, requested to soften but he forgotten and need to be reminded a 2nd time. Only reason to go was food and definitely not this type of service.
2
We visited once two years ago, and this restaurant's standards have unequivocally plunged (downward).The food was horrible. The mussel meat was barely 10 per cent of the actual mussel. The coleslaw was lukewarm, and tasted bad. The lobster mains were uncommendable.The self-proclaimed 'concierge' by the name of Eddie did two things:1) When we asked if we could get some chili crab sauce to go with the steamed buns, he answered with an impatient 'cannot lah'. Eddie appeared clearly upset, even unwilling, to answer our questions, even though we were just making simple clarifications.2) Eddie also dragged his feet when he brought us our food, the sound of his black leather boots reverberating through half the restaurant. His face was completely glum. (It seemed to us like perhaps he felt that he was not the right man for this job. Perhaps, he felt a 'concierge' like himself should not be waiting tables.) He set the the food down, did an about turn, and then dragged his feet while he stepped away. Honestly, he spoilt my appetite. I wonder, what did we do to offend him?On the other hand, a member of the staff, Dave (he introduced himself), was polite, courteous and ready to serve. Lovely guy
4
It has been a year since my husband and I had visited Pince and Pints. Glad that they have added a few new dishes. Tried truffle lobster roll and the amount of truffle is just nice. Maybe they can introduce sweet potato fries. It will be wonderful
2
We are satisfied with the food. Lobster noodles, lobster roll and lobster soup. However service is really terrible. They are slow and ignore you. One of the service staff even commented a vulgarity word loudly when he accidentally dropped a receipt in a cup that is meant to serve for customer. I pretty much love to go back there because of the food but definitely will think twice if its worth the trip due to their terrible service. Those who went there will know what i mean.
3
Really good lobster roll and steamed lobster, but the mussels were very poor despite a wonderful broth. We had to ask for a glass of wine three times... good place, but needs to deliver high end food and service for their prices.
4
still very good. I have the same as always - the grilled lobster! but did see theres some new additions to the menu.
3
Good food but at a high price. Oyster is fresh but small lobster. Sides and beer were good but pretty expensive
5
Great food, good ambience, but it was a bit pricey for the mains. The drinks menu was wide in selection, but the prices were quite steep.
4
Sides changed from buttery grilled corn to common coleslaw, imagine our disappointment! Nevertheless it was a decent meal as always. Price is pretty high though, even though the lobster meat quality was just above average
5
Menu is comprehensive, staff are very friendly and quick to answer any questions on the food, drinks, take photos for us.
4
Lobster rolls are amazing, generous portion of lobster.
Chilli lobster is great too, similar to chilli crab with the buns
5
food was awesome, service was good, ambience was there, everything was in order, given a cosy seat with indication of a birthday celebration with my boyfriend
4
Good alternative place to get your lobster fix. The lobster roll was the bomb! The roll was crispy, fragrant and yummy! The lobster was well seasoned and went really well with the roll. The fries and sweet potato fries were really good. However the grilled lobster did not meet expectation. The lobster piece was small, it wasn't Hot when served to us. The sauce that came with it could be less buttery? We also had the Chilli lobster . It was a good attempt. However Chilli crab at a zhi Cha place will be more worth it. Will be back for the lobster roll but not the rest! But good service from the staff!
3
To preface, I don't know much about lobsters. I came with a friend on Saturday 3pm, the place was absolutely empty. We were the only customers. This was not surprising because of the odd time we came.We had 1 steamed lobster to share and were planning on getting something else if the lobster was exceptional. The lobster wasn't as big as I expected, and wasn't as good as I expected. Not to say it was bad, but just so-so.We paid SGD70ish for the meal. I wouldn't mind the price if the food were better, but as it is, I don't think I'll be back for more.Service however, was very good. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly.P.S as I was eating the lobster I couldn't help but think we should have gone to Today in Marina Bay Sands for the snow crab buffet. Definitely would've been more worth it
4
We ordered the chilli lobster, lobster roll, lobster mac n cheese and 2 mocktails. We love all the dishes we ordered!
4
My 2nd visit to Pince and Pints and the food never failed to amaze me! Was perfect night for celebration!
4
The lobster thermidor that we ordered tasted quite good and fresh. However, the mussels do not have the buttery garlic taste that we wanted. Hefty price for each dish.
5
Lobster was huge and taste fabulous! We ordered chili lobster and the grilled whole lobster. Service provided by the staff was great.
5
The restaurant is fully packed which made it conducive for a good dinner. The service is good and food was nicely prepared.
2
The fried calamari starter had a batter that was cakey and some pieces were not cooked. Salad was an uninspired toss of butterhead lettuce, that was not even cut to bite sized, in vinegrette. Fries were cold. Lobster was extremely hard to deshell, but fortunately relatively fresh and not overcooked. Service staff were robotic and honestly look slightly tortured.
3
Queues are more manageable these days and the lobster is still very fresh and well prepared. Service is very good although the place is looking a bit more worn. The lobster roll here is almost as good as Neptune Oyster in Boston, but it's a lot smaller and almost double the price Lobster roll is perfect with a warm brioche bun. The new National Day special lobster noodles was fantastic, especially with jalapeÃ±o-like green chillies. Lobster burger was oily but tasty. Sweet potato fries were soggy but the wasabi mayo was a delicious complimen
4
Very friendly waiting staff made us felt very welcome the moment we walked into the restaurant. In response to our request, staff recommended a lobster to share and beer to go with. Unfortunately, I was having a bad throat, so decided to go for steamed lobster and skipped the beer. Also ordered half a dozen oysters as appetizer and a lobster roll to share as well. The oysters were smaller than some that we have eaten but are very fresh. We like it so much that we ordered another half dozen and the staff were so kind to charge us as an order for a dozen. The steamed lobster was of good size and fresh as well. The lobster roll was delicious. Only disappointments was the lack of a small spoon for the oyster dressing as mentioned by some other guests as well as not having a dessert menu. Perhaps these may be some improvements that the restaurant can consider. Price wise a little hefty but acceptable for the experience. Would like to visit again for beer to go with the lobsters
1
1. Waited at least 20 minutes despite there were many empty seats left (bear in mind we made reservation) 2. Attended by 'apparently not in good mood' waiter. 3. food was decent to be fair.4. We were served oysters, and dressing without a tea spoon?! I think we were expected to pour the dressing directly into our mouth.
5
Lobsters are very fresh, with very firm meat. Dined here since their opening in 2015 and all I can say is that the food and service has been consistently great. Although it saddens me that the original salad (with the watermelon cubes) were changed, the new salad tastes refreshing as well. It's just a personal preference on my part. My favourite has got to be the truffle lobster roll. The lobster thermidor is a great choice for cheese lovers like myself. Between the grilled lobster and the other choices, I would say go for the others because you'd really want to taste the sweetness of the fresh lobster that they have. On photos they may look small but the meal is actually quite filling. Will be back again
5
I absolutely love their lobster rolls. The buns used are different which I think makes their rolls super good! Will be back for more!
5
Lobster roll was very fresh and delicious, did not have to wait too long for the food to be served..
4
The food is great! The service even greater! Whether it's a special occasion or not, you won't be disappointed.
4
Food was really fresh and I really enjoyed the lobster roll!
You pay a premium but you get what you pay for, fresh and full lobsters cooked very well by the chefs.
3
Food was OK service was slow. Another table which was about 15mins came after us and got their food served as the same time as us. We waited almost 30mins for our food to be served.
4
Lobster was Super fresh! Waiters were rly friendly too. Although the place was a little hot the food made up for it! Recommended to make a reservation before hand. ~70-100/pax
3
I'm not sure when this happened but the lobsters there now are tiny! Is it a seasonal issue? Hopefully it is because for $68++ a pop, this is rather bad value for money.
3
The lobsters were really freshens yummy, for the price it's pretty reasonable and so was the wine. However in terms of service it was slightly lacking. We had two servers, one of them was friendly and nice but the other wasn't very pleasant(with his tone) and it sorted of spoilt the experience for my mum and I
4
have always love this place and the lobsters has been always excellent . I have always ordered the same thing truffles rolls and steam lobsters and decidedthis time will try the chili one. was good but not enough spicy and tasty for me , bit too sweet and bland, ended up adding up so much tabasco in it to have the tangy spicy taste that i was hoping for . Steam one was good and sauce is superb as usual .
4
Made a reservation for an early dinner on a Saturday evening and the place was rather packed. Waiters were prompt, albeit a little snobbish, and food were served very quickly, The food portion were quite big and serves good value against the price which you are paying. Lobster were all very fresh. I would highly recommend the Lobster Salad and Lobster Chowder. While I have heard many raving comments on the Lobster Roll, the bread which were deep fried was too oily for my liking.
4
Ordered steamed lobster and felt it was better than the grilled one which my wife ordered. Drinks are pretty expensive except for Asahi beer.
4
The portion sizes appear to have shrunk a little over the years. Nonetheless, it remains an enjoyable experience to return.
4
Pricey meal but the food was decent. First visited years back when it first opened - food standard remains the same
4
I like the concept with most dishes are usually of lobster-based or seafood based. I like the Chilli-crab lobster dish, I liked it the first time I visited the restaurant awhile back. I would not be surprised if that is their best-seller.
5
The lobsters were fresh, sweet and sizable. we had the chilli, the steamed, the roll and the briyani. All were delicious!
5
fresh lobsters with great service! Price is slightly on the high side for seafood but worth the once-in-a-while splurge. Cocktails are great too.
1
It was supposed to be a birthday celebration for my friends on that day and we had the worst experience of all. I was having a bad throat and requested for some hot water. Sadly, I was told by one of the waiters that "we do not server tap water but only bottled water. And, the only hot beverages we have are tea and coffee.". Fine, i shall make do with some bottled water then. I was made to believed that their attitude from the waiters were bad because of the high reviews of their food....We had some cakes brought in to have a quick celebration for my friend. The waiters did not offer any plates to us and one came to us only asking if we wanted to order more coffee or tea. When we said no, he just turned away shaking his head.We had been friendly to all of them throughout the dinner but we were slapped with their bad attitude. Overall, a terrible experience
2
I applaud this place to try to emulate Burger & Lobster but what a poor attempt. The lobster thermidor I ordered was less than mediocre; the lobster was not sweet and the baked crust was soggy and bland. Severely disappointing. For $68 a serving, it was badly executed. Even the dressing for my salad appetiser tasted awful. Why try to be creative when a simple balsamic dressing would suffice? Also, $6 for a bottle of still water is outrageous, especially in Singapore. I kept hearing tables next to mine exclaim in disbelief at the price of the water. Maybe the owners think $6 more would mean nothing much to the patrons when we are willing to pay for a lobster meal. Not for this patron that would take her business to an establishment with better food quality control. And free tap water. Kudos for the wait staff for the good service though, it was the only saving grace for my evening. Decent alcoholic drinks selection too. At least they did make good of the "Pints" bit in the restaurant's name.
3
We (4 of us) went to Pince & Pints for dinner on a Friday night for our first time. Reservation was made and only when all arrived that they allowed us to sit.During ordering, staff warned us that food will take awhile to come and advised to order some bites first. We ordered a mixed platter which had mussels, fries, fried calamari and lots of fried fish skin. The fried fish skin stood out the most, it was crispy, thin sliced, and freshly fried. Indeed, the food took some time which was understandable due to peak period. Our mains arrived after about 20-30mins. 3 of us ordered the grilled lobster and another ordered the truffle roll. All sets came with a short grilled corn cob and fries which were average. We left most of the corn untouched as it was a tad inconvenient to eat off the cob, we would have preferred the salad but there didn't seem to have this choice even though it was written on the board.On the other hand, the lobsters were fresh, thick and juicy and that made the dinner worthwhile. We enjoyed the lobsters very much. The service was good and staff were knowledgeable.Price was a tad pricey, $58 for grilled lobster, $68 for truffle lobster roll, $32 for mixed platter.Overall, the lobsters and service were very good while the sides were average.
3
I have been on the hunt for good lobsters and googled all the restaurants specializing in lobsters especially grilled lobsters. This was my third visit to Pince and Pints and I was surprised by the emptiness of the restaurant. It used to be impossible to get a table. Notwithstanding the emptiness of the restaurant on a Friday night, concierge insisted that I wait my entire party before seating me. What's with that. The restaurant was empty with a max of 5 tables filled. When finally seated, I was told they don't serve water. Sigh. I was seated on the second floor which was slightly warm. The grilled lobster was about $60. It wasn't a good size. It was served with a corn cob and fries. The butter sauce was delish. I thought the presentation could have been improved with a side of salad. Expensive. Could do with a side of salad. And yes cold water.
4
I got the a truffle lobster roll and I enjoyed it a lot as it was rich in truffle flavour and yet it did not overpower the taste of the lobster. Service was good as usual and I enjoyed the dining experience a lot.
3
Great place for their lobster roll. Food was good. Service was ok. They made us wait at the bar till our group appeared which was so unnecessary since it was a weekday and they were not full. In all good food.
4
Good quality lobsters! Service was also prompt and good. Only gripe was that you have to pay for water here :(
5
The lobster roll and live lobster is fresh and savory, mocktail highly recommended. Do remember to provide print-out Chope vouchers to enjoy the discount.
4
Nice food. Chilli lobster was spicy and authentic. Very good fries. Love the sauce! Great place for a date night!
3
Had lobster roll at P&P. I need to drink a lot of iced water when I have dinner out, so when a restaurant does not serve iced water (I do not mind paying 50 cents for it!), I will not return. It used to be strictly walk-in only and group will be seated when the whole gang is here. They now do take reservation and through Chope too. But they kept the silly policy of seating group when all parties arrived even when the restaurant was totally empty at 6pm. Food was good but way too pricey. Service was so-so only even when we were the one table for the initial part of the evening... it started to get more patrons only after 7, still, it was not full house this evening. Guess the hype is over
4
My friend and I was out celebrating his birthda at pince and pints. While they serve all the food at the same time (hence a lack of table space), we had to use another table space. When we were done with our starters, the servers were not around so we decided to move on to mains on our own. My friend accidentally dropped the man-tous and this lady noticed it and got it replaced, apologizing for not serving them in the right sequence. Next, I mentioned to her that it was my friend's birthday and asked if they sold cakes. They don't have a dessert menu but she got us a birthday cocktail on the house. I may be easily impressed, but most importantly, she made our day
2
We went there as walk in, just nice as they just opened - was early around 1730H. The staff look quite unhappy and shocked as it looks like they are not that welcoming (maybe due to early diners or what - but that is what reflects on his face). Next thing they've asked if we have a reservation, we mentioned no and we're just a walk in. They took a while to check whether they'll allow us even there's nobody in the restaurant yet. But I think, they are out of choice so they actually allowed us while STRICTLY EMPHASIZING that they need the table back by 1930H. It is annoying as we just want to have dinner and once is enough to say it. So after then, they gave us the cold treatment, which just really upsets us for a first time experience. We even ordered a bottle of wine as we still want to have a fun night amidst of the bad experience and service from the staff. What's even worst - the staffs are not even alert nor attentive on looking after the guests (or maybe they're doing it on purpose to us) as they just want to have a chill evening? We have been waiting for the food for like 45mins. and they want the table to be back by 7.30. Wow! The food arrives when the bottle of wine is at it's half. The staff makes the experience real worst although I could say that the food is honestly delicious. But at the end of the day, it is really the entire experience that makes a visit worth. So for me and friend this is a totally FAIL one of a kind experience even the food is great.Also, I actually have a picture of the staff sipping his cup of espresso while using his phone even our wine glass is all empty and it's been half an hour wait for the food. Really wow! I prefer not to post it for the sake of the person as well. This review is well enough to share my thoughts for this restaurant. Really disappointing and not worth a penny

I have never left a review before ever but the experience here was so appalling i just had to.Had a reservation for 4 at 8.15pm on a Saturday. it's my 2nd time here after 2 years and its popularity has noticeably declined. i remember there was always a long wait, but now there were empty tables on a Saturday night. my boyfriend and i arrived early at 8.10pm, while my friends had not yet arrived. Told the waiter at the door that we had a reservation to which he checked and said to give him 5 minutes to get the table ready.During the next 5 minutes, a couple walked in and got their table. we were just standing outside like idiots. So at 8.15pm, the conversation went like this:me: is our table ready?waiter: what's your reservation under again?*mind you it's the same person!*boyfriend pointed to the name in the bookwaiter: oh has all your party arrived?boyfriend: no, but it's empty and a couple just walked inme: can we just go in and order alcohol while we wait? they'll be here shortlywaiter: if you want drinks you can have it by the barboyfriend: there are empty tables inside. then why do we have to make a reservation. in that case i can just walk in as a party of 2. and have my friends walk in as another party of 2 to take the empty table next to ours.me: it's ok, let's go. we can get lobster fix at other places toowaiter: *touching my boyfriend's shoulder* Sir, if you insist, i can sit you downINSIST?!?! what a joke seriously. i understand the "rule" of if your party is not all here, then a restaurant cannot let you in sometimes but that is only if you're doing well. with the obvious decrease in popularity should you still apply this rule. the area was sooo quiet as it is already, can you really afford to lose any customers?we didnt go in in the end. but i remember that the lobster 2 years back was not that fresh too. reason why there was this reservation was because my boyfriend wanted to satisfy my craving for lobster and he had not tried Pince and Pints before so he did it as a surprise. if not for this, i never would have wanted to come back here again. much less deal with that disgusting waiter

The impression the restaurant gives is that it's cheap 'n' cheerful with great lobster at a great price. Having noted lobster prices at a couple of nearby restaurants I'm not sure it is that great value.The lobster is certainly fresh and has good flavour and is generally cooked well. All other food items are on the heavy side though, and the meal overall doesn't feel so healthy. The menu is also quite limited.On this occasion the service started out badly: the server came across as quite arrogant and seemed to want to rush through. But it did improve during the evening.They serve a decent local beer
3
Not a bad meal, but not one that i wld go back for. Low value for money. Spent 170 bucks for 2 ppl, with no alcohol. 2 mains, 1 starter, 1 mocktail.
4
Although a little on the pricey side, it was still a very satisfying meal. Will definitely be back again.
3
Terribly overpriced food which was at best of average quality. Mussels were very tiny. Lobster was tough and the quality and quantity wasn't worth the price paid.
3
Food & service was okay (ordinary) but they sat all of us together on one side of the restaurant. We had dripping air conditioning units above us and a large table next to us with maids & crying babies that didn't care they were impacting anyone else's Saturday night. Poor management to seat small tables along side a large inconsiderate family playing YouTube videos on iPads to entertain their kids. They should be home in bed by the way. That's why they are crying.
4
Great food. Service was a tad slow and the ambience could be better but overall very good food. The tables on the upper floor are so close to each other that we could hear adjacent conversations clearly, which wasn't the most romantic scenario. I would say it's great for a friends' get-together than a place to go on a date. Pricey, but big portions. Loved the lobster mac-n-cheese and the lobster bun. Great bread
3
Further to my review dated 27 Feb 2017 just to highlight that waitress 'Mika' saved the whole evening by competently following up and delivering a nice service throughout. Very natural and pleasant balanced with competence and attentiveness. They nearly 'lost' us in the first few minutes but Mika 'found' us and we had an acceptable birthday dinner. Thanks Mika

I popped in for lunch with my wife having passed by this place 100 times having heard from friends and colleagues it's 'not worth it'. I like to try everything for myself but feel I should have heeded their advice. Without drinks you are looking a little over S$130 for 2 x lobster rolls. The fries are a small portion, nothing special there nor wrong either. The sweet brioche type roll that the half acceptable amount of tasty lobster comes in reminds me of the commercial chain Singapore bakery (bread talk) style buns. Though it somewhat worked it was not quite as sweet but I don't want to be reminded of this place when having such an expensive lunch. The interior style is American diner with comfy red leather corner booths. A couple of issues/negatives were the air con turned to the max with condensation dripping from one of them and the god awful style lights that look like a spiders legs. There were only 4 tables taken so found a member of staff was always on hand and found them to be quick and attentive, a rarity in Singapore. For me it's a 2.5/5, though I was taught to round up so I have to give 3 here. Won't be visiting again.
4
Pretty pricey (I'm comparing this to a similarly tasting lobster roll in say New York/Boston). The regular lobster roll ($58)!was the best dish. The truffle roll ($68) was too heavy and you didn't taste the freshness of the lobster. The chilli crab lobster was so so.
4
Thoroughly enjoyed my truffle lobster roll, but found it incredibly pricey at $80 after tax and service. I really liked the truffle sauce as well and asked for extra sauce. The server gave it to me but only told me it was chargeable at $5 after I had started dipping into the sauce. Otherwise, bread was toasted well and very soft inside, with good chunks of sweet lobster
3
Waited for an hour for the food to arrive. No one told us that we had to wait for an hour for the food. My tea took another 30mins to arrive. Food came it was acceptable and good but we didnt have the appetite after the long wait. Am sure it wld taste much better if it had arrived earlier. Gave feedback to the manager and he did give us the tea complimentary and was apologetic. Could have improved bette
4
Had the lobster roll, chili lobster and oysters. Lobster meat was fresh and sweet, and service was attentive and very polite.
4
The taste is quite nice but the sauce should could be more fragrant . Food taked very long time to cook. I ordered lobster roll . It was serve cold. Bread should be warm .
4
food was good, waiters were attentive! but wouldn't recommend the mac & cheese, it was too watery for my taste. lobster roll was amazing as usual
5
My first time at Pince & Pint. Really fresh lobster with really yummy sauce. Service was prompt. Great place to hang out.
4
The restaurant specializes in lobster dishes. Their lobster roll is not bad. But other lobster dishes like chilli lobster are just so so.
3
If you don't like lobster then don't come here! The lobster is, as one would hope given it makes up the bulk of the menu, rather good. I dithered between giving the food 3 or 4 stars. Setting is informal, certainly not fancy, with a pleasant atmosphere of people just enjoying their meals.The Crossroads beer is tastier than what most restaurants offer. A shame there is just the one variety though
3
The first time I came here was more than a year ago but I remember I had a good experience. so this time, I decided to bring my parents as it was my dad's birthday. They gave us a table on the 2nd floor, my mum (who had a spine surgery before) and I (carrying a 8kg baby) had a hard time climbing up the stairs. We ordered the food at around 620pm but the first dish was served only at 705pm and the rest around 10mins later. With a 6 months old baby in my arms, I don't appreciate the waiting. Asked for the birthday cake I brought, had to wait long. Asked for bill, had to wait long too. My husband went downstairs to pay in the end as my baby was getting grouchy. Food was quite good but I probably won't go again as there are many restaurants in Spore now that serve similar kind of food
5
Been wanting to try this place for a while, and I finally did! It was such a satisfying dinner - we had the lobster roll (the meat and the bun went so well together, strongly recommend it with the lemon herb sauce), and the chilli lobster with mantou was a huge portion! Very well worth the price. Service was great too :
1
One of the worst customer service experience in Singapore. All thanks to one of its senior serving member... see picture. Check out the photos where seats were overturned at 9.50pm where the restaurant closes at 11pm. How would you feel when you witness the scene? I will be keen to know.
4
The service was good and the staffs there are friendly and have good knowledge of the food they are serving. The staffs gave good recommendation as it was our first time there. They took initiative to take photos for us and joke around with us.Food is good i would recommend the lobster roll
4
Ordered the lobster thermidor and lobster roll. Both are great, with large chunk of lobster. Food was fresh but pricing is pretty steep. One of the staff seems to be having a bad day but the rest are fine.
3
Losbter roll is not bad, but losbter whole is disappointing. I'm not sure if it's because the losbter isn't fresh or the way it's being cooked. And for the price I'm paying, I feel it's slightly on the expensive side.
5
Food is nice....
Staffs are friendly..
From the moment step in, the staff very polite and help to recommend their signature dish......
5
This place is not cheap. But worth. The roll is really good. It like salad type but with many lobster meat inside. The sauce is nice also. This location is not easy to find so better use a taxi. The mussels is good as well.

It was my first time to visit this restaurant. We had 6 people and did not make table reservation for dinner. We were lucky that there were spare tables but outdoor. We had a great time to look at the menu as my girlfriend had visited their branch at London. I had the live whole lobster, grilled type. Was really good and strongly recommended if you have not tried it before. All of us had ordered different dishes of lobsters. Their meals range from $58+ to $68+Must try their home made lychee iced tea plus we can pour the syrup according to your sweetness level.Food were great except the service staff. They looked like very slack, not much motivation plus less attentive, one of their staff were playing mobile phone when we were arrived. We were here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday dinner. I left my red velvet cupcakes with them to leave in the fridge to chill because they were covered with frosted cream cheese. I asked them to take out from the fridge before we all left the place. They just simply left it at the counter without returning to me. After all, all were good
3
3rd time-food remained good. service lacking- they didnt know abt chope vouchers and we had printed them out. Still asked repeatedly if they were for P&P - the name was printed! Deliberately slow in clearing-waiter took a long time just to moved my knife towards him like a ninja wielding sword
2
This place sells mainly lobster dishes. Lobsters are served in a variety of ways (steamed, grilled, thermidor, chilli) and are priced at 58++ and 68++ each, which were seriously overpriced, given that the lobsters are not big. My family had one of each to try out the different varieties and were disappointed that the lobsters were not only overcooked and rubbery, but also came a little cool.Service staff were hardly warm, except for one of the ladies who showed a bit more attention. The rest were there just to perform a job and were not too concerned about customer experience. The family was not asked of we wanted, or served any water even till halfway through our meal. Extremely disappointing experience especially when it was super to be a treat for my parents. Will not be going back.
4
Had the grilled lobster and lobster roll. Sweet and tender meat and buttery bread roll. Awesome. But restaurant was too noisy as the tables are too close to one another. Not too conducive for a couple date. Couldn't wait to get out of the place after food.
4
We had lunch at pince and pints. Had a whole grilled lobster and lobster roll. Both dishes were tasty, with the lobsters done just right. The bun for the lobster roll was nice and buttery, with a good helping of the lobster. Sides of corn and fries were tasty. The dips served along with the dishes were pretty good too. However, we found the pricing to be on the steep side. So if price is not a concern, then this is a great place to go to.
4
The waiter was very friendly and served us professionally. Ambience is good and the menu has quite a wide verity of lobsters. Occasionally there would be festive menus eg; Christmas. Food portion was just nice and you could even pair the lobsters with wine. Overall experience was fantastic and I would definitely return for another round of lobsters.
4
The food is good, service is pleasant and very relax and cook environment for dine in. Perhaps the server may serve water before we ask for it.
4
Great food as always, staff are always professional friendly and smiley.
Always a pleasure to dine at Pince and Pints
5
The lobsters are flown fresh and cooked here giving diners a local flavour The chilli sauce and buns make the lobsters taste better than crabs
Service was excellent and the restaurant is well kept

Went with my friend on quiet sat afternoon. We arrived and there was only one table already seated and restaurant almost empty. We were given seats facing the kitchen and staff room and we asked to change seats but service staff said we might not be able to get their attention if we do so?!?! Then came other customers, Caucasian customers and they got to seat wherever they liked and the staff even asked where they wanted to sit by the window or below aircon etc. So i got up and changed seats myself. Later on another 3 chinese guys and they also asked to change seats after they were given my table but were rejected as well. Food was not too bad but given that it was not a busy afternoon we had to ask for water to be refilled. To be fair not all the service staff was bad, the poor service we got was from 1 or 2 staff. This was my first visit and unfortunately I bought 2 vouchers for this restaurant so I will have to have another meal there again. Hope the service will be better next time
1
I am a regular visitor of this restaurant. In fact, if you look below at the comments, you'll probably see comments I made earlier about the restaurant. My first few experiences at P&P was an absolute delight with the previous staff. The most recent experience however, was a total turn off. The staff who served us - Dino - had to be reminded more than once when we asked for extra servings of sauces and drinks. He also mixed up the sauce that we asked for. The latest experience is a huge disservice to the restaurant's previous staff who really went out of their way to make sure you enjoyed your experience.The evening was extremely disappointing
3
We were so looking forward to try this place out judging by all the good reviews, but the whole experience was a little disappointing. Staffs were no friendly at all, out of the whole lot, only one lady staff was really enthusiastic. The lobsters were fresh but unimpressionable, so why all the ravings
5
Went with a girlfriend and it's her 1st time to the rest. The food was good and the staff were all so helpful and attentive. We ordered some beer that was on promotion and it went down so well with the food. Honestly it may seems a little too exp for 2 persons but both of us enjoyed it very much and didn't mind a bit
3
My friend took me to one, it was delicious but I could not remember its name. So a couple of nights ago I had cravings for lobsters and decided to give this a try. Staff was helpful but that's about the only noteworthy point. Lobster were small (rightfully so for the price), nicely grilled but nothing to write home about, the veggie salad actually was the highlight
3
The photos have been so good that one has to come. SO came here for the lobster rolls. The bread was sweet and there a tremendous lobster roll with nice creamy sauce. Lobster came with delicious corn on the cob and fries. Unfortunately service was not very good
4
We had the lobster roll, grilled whole lobster and the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster was absolutely fresh and delicious! The food took a while to come but the wait was worth it! My mom totally enjoyed her birthday meal. The waiter gave us window seats and we were seated a distance from the others which gave us more privacy. Kudos to that! Absolutely appreciate not having to squeeze with other customers if the restaurant is not very packed! The waiter also checked on us a couple of times to ensure that we were enjoying our meal. It would have scored full marks if the waiter was a tad more smiley instead of giving off fierce vibes though! There was a particularly person (likely to be the boss) who was very friendly and polite throughout our visit though!
4
If you have been to Burgers and Lobsters in London, and enjoyed it there, a visit to Pince and Pints would be in order.
4
Good Ambience, Good Service, Good Food. It was a pleasant and enjoyable experience. The only downside is the food was abit expensive
4
Everything went well except for the fact that the waitress took the liberty of telling us how the lobster was still moving when it was cooked as she cleaned our table. That was utterly unnecessary. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars
5
We celebrated our friend's birthday in the restaurant and the staff prepared a surprise for us! Super attentive and good attitude totally made our day. Good job!
3
Fresh lobsters were served. It could have been better if they provided cover like napkins when we tried cracking open the lobsters. It was all over the place
4
Ambiance: GoodService: Fairly GoodLobsters: FreshWorth the price: $160.07 with 2 lobsters and Asahi Beer promotion (3 bottles)Must try: The Grilled LobsterAsk the chef: The Chili LobsterCelebrated my best friend birthday and I was kinda disappointed cos they don't have desserts. Wanted to surprise the birthday friend with a cake, but that didn't happen. Oh wells. That's why, its not gonna be a full 5 STARSIf you have visited Burgers and Lobsters in London, the taste DOES not come close... So don't expect too much and go YA YA with, Burgers and Lobsters is so MUCH better! That's what I called a #foodporn.Well, it aint London my dear

When we were showed to the table, we were given the last table at the end facing outside by the glass dorm. To make matters worse, there were no room to move into the seat as the space between the table and the next was about 5 cm. We asked if we are allowed to sit at the table right beside the side service counter and was told that someone booked a table. (Harlow?! So did we...) they relented after saying that we have to leave by 7.15pm. We were there at at 6.15pm. We sat down regardless because we honestly couldn't care less and if they want to get us out of the door by 7.15pm, that's their problem, not ours. We ordered and saw that e couple on the other table eventually left and a family took that table instead, which made more sense as there is no space to go into the seats whatsoever. They didn't show us the laksa promotion menu as well until we asked for it. I've ate at the establishment previously and wanted to try the new dishes so I am aware that there is this special promotion. We noticed the rest of the diners were also not given the promotion menu.. why?Otherwise, the rest of the evening was fine n uneventful
4
We arrived early for our reservation and got a table immediately. We knew what we wanted to order, and did so within 5 minutes. However, our food took 40 minutes to arrive and we were famished by then. We saw another table who ordered much later than us, and got their food at the same time. We wonder if our orders got forgotten as the food came quickly after a staff checked if we needed any help. I bet we looked like we were waiting for too long. 40 minutes was too long and it was not a good experience at all for my boyfriend's birthday celebration on his actual birthday. I felt so so bad. Also, the washroom was dirty and stank. Could be better improved by refurnishing as it looked dated. The food was really great though, no doubt about that.
4
So much of Singapore is large relatively soulless establishments, this was a great recommendation from a friend. Needless to say if you don't like lobster then probably one to avoid, however we both found it to be fantastic. Ordered the lobster chowder and a grilled lobster. Both were excellent. The sides were simple but well done, the lobster very much the star of the show. The wine list was a bit limited, especially when they told you us that two of the four whites weren't available and the service was efficient rather than warm, but all that said, would definitely return, would be a great venue for a group
4
If you love this shellfish this place is a must to try the lobsters done every which way. There is grilled lobster, steamed lobster, chilli lobster, lobster with laksa and more lobster eg lobster roll. I had the grilled lobster served with a succulent butter dressing with a side of fries. The lobster cost $50 (sing dollars). It wasn't cheap but those are the rates. My other favorite lobster haunt is Lobster and Burgers in Uk. The same dish cost you 20 quid but what I like about the uk restaurant is the generous portions. The Singapore lobster experience lacked a side of salad. It would be great to have that to cut through the rich flavors of the lobster and the fried fries. Be that as it may, it's worth a visit especially if you love lobsters.
4
Food was good, especially the lobster roll. Chowder was too thick for my liking. Give the laksa (promotional item) a try too!
5
Really great service & great food! Laksa lobster was an awesome recommendation! Grilled lobster was succulent without need for sauce. Only 1 recommendation - option for better sides with the lobster. Overall an awesome dinner.
4
The Lobster Roll was delicious and the Chilli Lobster was fantastic. Good waiters and Good Ambience. It was a pleasant dining experience.
4
A must try for first timers to pine and pints- lobster roll! Will definitely go back again for this!
5
Thanks to TA, I found this little gem. We ordered the Lobster Roll (their signature dish) and Lobster Thermidor. The Lobster Roll was really superb (not very big portion though).I was a bit concern when the Lobster T thermidor arrived - it had a dried looking layer of bread crumbs on top, instead of the cheesy, gooey layer of cheese that I am accustomed to. However, to my pleasant surprise, the lobster meat was really fresh and juicy! It wasn't a cheap meal but for the quality of food, I would happily go back again in the future. Do check this place out if you are a lobster fan. You won't be disappointed
5
I've been seeing many photos of lobster rolls in Instagram from different places. When I heard that there was an eatery in Duxton Road that served different Lobster cuisines, I was intrigued and I really wanted to try this place.It was on a weekday during lunch that we decided to try this place. It was not difficult to find Pince and Pints as it was along side with some eatery shops and cafes.The shop served varieties of Lobster cuisine such Singapore laksa, lobster roll, seafood platter with lobster, grilled lobster and many more. They served varieties of drinks too from non-alcoholic to alcoholic.The place was quite cozy. Servers were polite and attentive. It was quite crowded when we arrived, but lucky for us we get a table after a few minutes.We ordered:"Lobster Roll"With grilled corn, straight cut fries and garlic aioli sauce.(I ordered this, and I loved it! The garlic aioli sauce was perfect with the lobster roll. The bread was a little bit crispy which is perfect for my lobster roll. Definitely a must try!)"Lobster Noodle"Crispy egg noodle doused with homemade umami lobster gravy, topped with their signature whole lobster, Shimeji white mushrooms, carrots and Hong Kong choy sum.(My friend ordered this, but I tried a few bites and I liked it too. The gravy was perfect with the crispy noodles. The lobster was fresh and sweet!)Overall, Pince and Pints serves fresh lobsters with great service. Definitely a must try to visit. The best lobster eatery in town so far.
5
It's the second time I've been there. Food is always on point. Their truffle lobster roll dish, it's star is the truffle butter sauce. Hands down the best sauce ever! It's slightly pricy but the quality of the lobster, it is to die for. I will definitely recommend this place. It's delicious!!
4
Heard good things about this place and decided to have dinner tonight, we were indeed not disappointed! The lobsters were very fresh and succulent, we had grilled and thermidor, prices were reasonable too. It's a casual place, with a limited menu specializing in lobster dishes. The lobster were live and air-flown from Boston, don't think you can go wrong with that! We will definitely return, intend to try the lobster chowder and perhaps lobster roll next time. It was a very satisfying dinner and good dining experience
4
Being seafood lovers we were thrilled when I finally found a hassle free way to reserved a table at Pince and Pints. We ordered a lobster chowder and salad for starters. The chowder was tasty. The salad however was a little lacklustre. Our mains of grilled whole lobster and Thermidor Lobster was definitely the highlight of our meal. I will greatly recommend the grilled version as it brings out the sweetness of the lobster.
3
Food was not as good as what I thought it would be. I've ordered the Lobster Crispy Noodles and Grilled Lobster. Customer service was not up to standard and it was so different as compared to my first visit 2 years back. Sadly to say, I doubt so I will be back again.
4
Good service with great food served. Went on a Monday and it was pretty comfortable and private. First visit was on a thursday and it was really packed, if you're looking for a quiet place, probably Monday would be a good day to go.
4
Yummylicious grilled lobster. Meat was fresh and juicy. Lobster roll would be a good alternative for those who do not like the hassle of digging out the meat. Lobster chowder was a delight too!!👍
5
The lobster roll and grilled lobster are absolutely delicious ! Worth the calories! Will definitely visit again!
5
There are other restaurants selling Maine lobsters but not many use fresh, live lobsters, flown in on a weekly basis. Frozen lobster tails are crunchy but the sweet taste is missing from the flesh, these are usually served on cruises and at lower priced restaurants.The menu is pretty straight forward - chose the style you like, cooked plain or in chilli sauce - I prefer the chilli sauce that is served with bread because it goes a longer way. They have recently added lobster thermidor, and other seafood dishes.Service: Very good, pleasant waiters and waitresses who know their stuff.Drinks: Lots of variety to celebrate any occasion. Ambience: simple but the aircon works fine ! Watch out for the pet lobster in a tank.Value: Live lobsters are not low priced but on a per kg basis, it is lower priced than crabs and you get a lot more meat per kg
5
Loved this place... the location was alittle hard to locate but once we got there.. the roll was DELICIOUSSSSS finger liking good... so you dont miss a piece. The chips and the dipping sauce.. with the corn on the cob...It was soooo good... DEFINATELY MUST TRY!!!
4
Always loved P&P, went back again for lobsters. They changed menu by adding on several new items like oysters etc. Had lobster roll, which is fantastic, with corn on cob, fries and dip that's tasty good. Prices went up from SGD49++ to SGD68++ for my roll, pretty steep now
4
If you're a crustacean lover and lobster is all you can think about at days, you definitely have to try them out. They only have 4 main lobster dishes to choose from; Chilli Lobster, Lobster Roll, Grilled Lobster or Steam Lobster. I've tried all of them and I love them all! The lobster is of decent size and done right with a price tag that will not (really) burn a hole in your wallet. (P.s. Ask for the garlic aioli sauce.
3
With all the rave reviews about this place, we wanted to check this place out after the crowd had weaned down. Made reservations (which was recently introduced) to avoid having to wait in line.We ordered the truffle roll ($68++) and chilli lobster ($58++) which were pretty good.My only gripe is the small serving and tad overpriced menu
5
We stumbled into this place looking for dinner. The area is very cute with a lot of dining options - so after asking around for good seafood we were directed to Pince and Pints. The ambiance was very nice - great bar and a dining are not too small and not too large. When you watch restaurant shows, the advice of great chefs is to have a simple menu to ensure everything is fresh and can be expertly prepared. Well, this place has gotten the simplicity down: it features only one dish, lobster. Prepared 4 different ways - steamed, chilli, etc. We got the chili version and it was delicious, elegantly presented and accompanied by great sides. The service was great. The bar features some amazing cocktails. Wonderful experience: come check it out
4
The family arranged a birthday dinner here and it was a good experience. Service was excellent and very attentive.You can have lobster done several ways - grilled, steamed, cooked with chilli and mantou buns or in a lobster roll with truffles. We found all varieties to be delicious, though the truffle was a little heavy. The best dish was the grilled lobster, which enhanced the sweetness of the flesh. The fries (which could have been a larger portion, most of us thought) went very well with the garlic aioli which the staff kindly brought for us.Portions were smallish and the men left still feeling slightly peckish. Drinks can be expensive here though they have a wide range, including a lychee martini
4
Been wanting to try out their lobster roll as have heard raving reviews about them. Finally got my hands on them and yes, they are awesome! Only set back is that it is quite pricey.
2
The Burger and Lobster wannabe but nothing like it, the lobster was bland, fries weren't even special
5
Tried their grilled lobster and truffle roll.
Their roll is better than the roll in London !
Just price it's a little pricey as compared to London >_<
4
Been wanting to try out this place for some time and finally got a friend who is willing to dine here with me.Ordered the chilli lobster (a spin-off from Singapore's famous chilli crabs) and I wasn't disappointed. Gravy was thick and spicy enough, and the mantous (fried buns) are good. My friend had the lobster roll and was satisfied with the taste as well. All lobster dishes are $58++ and there are basically 4-5 types of lobster dishes available only. No side dishes that you can order. They do have a long list of alcoholic drinks though
3
Personally, I think the place is over-rated. I felt that the food was so-so. Lobster is fresh. But that's about it.For the price we paid, we came out still feeling hungry. As for service quality, hmm.. We already made a reservation at 7 but we were not allowed to be seated at 7 till everyone reached. I could understand if the restaurant was full. But it didn't seem like the case as we got our seats once our last friend appeared at 7.05pm.Unless it is specifically requested by my friends to visit out of novelty, I don't think I will visit again.
4
Tried out this place on our anniversary a couple of days ago. You can make reservations now because they have expanded to the shophouse adjacent, but we went early at 6pm and there were only a couple of tables occupied. Great interior design similar to a New York or Boston diner. Especially like the tank with the lobster near the washrooms. Service was excellent, staff were always on hand to meet your every request and need plus they offered extra butter sauce without prompting. Had the Truffle Lobster Roll and Grilled Whole Lobster. Both were delicious. The normal butter sauce is better than the truffle sauce in my opinion as after awhile the truffle tends to overwhelm your taste buds. The lobster are well cooked, succulent and juicy. Although some times, the lobster flesh sticks to the shell which is a hindrance. Is it the best place to have lobster, I don't think so but for the entire experience it is definitely worth it. They also have nice cocktails and mocktails on their drinks menu which you just have to try. Go for the minty mocktail if you want something non-alcoholic and refreshing to pair with your meal

It was lovely! Was there just a week ago, and the taste still honestly kinda lingers in my mouth! It was so so soft and I could even bite on some huge pieces of lobsters. The salad was also so interesting, who ever thought watermelon tasted so yummy with a garden salad! The staff there were also really pleasant and the ambiance was nice with great music/decor! *Warning, this is more on the pricey side! $58++ per main course. But the Truffle Lobster Roll costs $68++ and is limited ed

My Girlfriend brought me here , and I was wowed by the great service by Darren, he carefully explained every single dish and recommended me the lobster roll. The lobster was done carefully perfect. Not rubbery. My Girlfriend's grilled lobster was also grilled to perfection. Simply love the chic ambience and dishes. Darren is a excellent service orientated staff as he doesn't up sell or push the guests instead giving his honest opinions. And im Glad I took his recommendation. Well done!

I found this place similar to London's Burger and Lobster, just that it is less value for money because of it's smaller portions.We had the best-selling Lobster Roll and limited Truffle Roll. The former had a great cold lobster stuff in a warm bun, some fries and a salad. The latter had the same two sides in addition to a richly truffle-flavoured bun. There was evidence of real truffle and the sauce was heavenly! A pity that the food was a bit too little.Service is great. They explain the menu clearly and looked out for our baby, whom we were feeding too

Checkout this place as it was recommended by a friend for dinner. I was very impressed by the service, waiters were very helpful and friendly. Me and a friend had their two lobster specialty dishes, I highly recommend the lobster roll, it was really delicious. Music and environment was pretty nice. Prices might be slightly on the high side but to me it was worth it for 600gms of lobster.

This place needs no introdcution, if you want a good lobster meal with friends, this is the best place for it. Simple and straightforward menu with good hospitality. Only thing is the crazy line for it. Go early!
5
Only lobster, super easy to choose, super quality, super service.
Reasonable food and wine price as for an upmarket Singaporean establishment.

Lobster were fresh and juicy. You could taste the natural sweetness with the steam lobster and the charred taste for the grill ones. It comes with salad and fries.If u like lobster this is a place for you to go. Portion is however small if u are a big eater.

One of my favorite haunts when I have a lobster craving. That's all they have on the menu, lobster done 4 ways (grilled, steamed, roll and with chilli crab sauce). Not cheap at almost 50 Singapore dollars for each dish, but probably the best lobster I've had back home. The queues used to be crazy long but it's not such an issue nowadays.

This restaurant has been really popular since it opened at Duxton Hill. I finally had a chance to visit with a friend recently. They have some new additions to their menu, which are truffle based, which I tried. Along with food, they also have cocktails which I also looked forward to. Here are the highlights of our meal:- Truffle Lobster Roll: $62. A new addition to their menu. The Boston lobster is cut into chunks and topped with truffle caviar and truffle shavings. Its served with a side of salad, straight-cut fries and homemade truffle sauce. The homemade truffle sauce had a texture of ‘thick mushroom soup’. A nice sauce to go with the dish.The salad had watermelon cubes in it which was nice. - Grilled Live Whole Boston Lobster: $58. The lobster is halved and grilled. It’s meaty and juicy. A shell cracker and meat extractor are also provided for each diner, so it was easy to extract the meat out from the shell and the claws. This came with a chef salad, straight-cut fries and herbed butter sauce.We asked for a side of garlic aioli sauce as a dip for the fries. It’s good. Here are the cocktails that I tried:- Burning Lobster: $12. This is unique. It comes as two shots – 1 glass of Resposado Tequila with a blend of Cajun spices; 1 glass of home-made chilli lobster sauce (which was the chaser). First you down the tequila in 1 go, then down the chilli lobster sauce immediately. Yes, it sounds weird but its good. The tequila will have a burning sensation on the throat, but the chilli lobster sauce will sooth it right away. One wasn’t enough, and I had to have another one.Good stuff, recommended!- 500 Days of Summer: $22. This was a refreshing cocktail. Served in a tall glass, it’s made with gin, fresh lemon and lime, homemade Cantaloupe soda and garnished with fresh mint. Easy to drink. A good meal and it’s a meal that I will definitely remember for some time.Recommended

Been here a few times, mid week. Lobster dishes are as advertised ..good quality, only 2 choices .. So it's great as a midweek place where you can't be bothered surfing pages of a menu... Best is to get a seat at the bar. Don't be tempted by the side tables etc. But as ever it's about the staff... Last visit we almost walked out due to the rude almost offensive attitude of the waitress seating guests ... But one of the experienced staff stepped in and more than made up for it. For sure will be back.

Dined at Pince and Pints over the long weekend. As a Canadian who's cycled the island of PEI, consuming lobster daily - my expectations for my lobster experience in Singapore were not high. How wrong was I? The steamed lobster presented to me was perfectly cooked - not overdone - an 800gm lobster with deliciously succulent meat. It was presented with herb butter, fries and a salad - simple accompaniments - complementing the lobster. Chilled beer and white wine topped the meal. The lobster roll was tasty too - but a purest " die die must try " a whole lobster. Thanks PNP! We'll be back

Having studied in Boston for five years, I'll admit that I am a complete snob when it comes to Lobster Rolls and any food that hails from New England (side note: if any of you reading this can put me on to a legitimately good and proper New England Clam Chowder in Singapore, please send me a personal message with your recommendation). Besides Clam Chowder (or, chowdah' as it's affectionately known in Boston), any preparation of the North Atlantic species of Lobster -specifically the ones that hail from the waters off Maine- is the other dish we are insanely picky over...butter poached, steamed, on a roll, in your mac and cheese...you name how it is prepared and served, we obsess over every detail. To me, the Lobster Roll by far and away is the quintessentially New England dish of summer. So living 10,000 miles away in Singapore, it can be tough to find a good one when you are in the mood and have a craving for one. Thankfully, there are now a handful of places that offer a proper and legitimately decent Lobster Roll using lobsters from Maine or the North Atlantic. Pince and Pints would definitely be on that list. The Lobster was cooked perfectly, nicely diced up into pieces that weren't small yet not too big and it balanced nicely with the mayo/aioli it was mixed with. The butter toasted roll was good and held its structure throughout the 2 minutes it took me to devour the Lobster Roll (yes, it was that good and I was hungry!). The rich buttery flavor of the roll didn't overpower the Lobster and it also didn't get soggy which was a good thing. The fries accompanying the Lobster Roll were ok and the side salad with watermelon was a nice refreshing way to end the meal. The only thing I think can be improved on is a touch more seasoning for the lobster and the uniqueness of the lobster roll. It did taste and look incredibly similar to another lobster roll that I've had in Singapore at another establishment but the key difference was that the bread at the one at Pince and Pints didn't disintegrate on me. Service here is top notch. Attentive, friendly and cheerful. It was refreshingly good to experience this for a change and it looked like just about everyone here was enjoying their jobs as they all had smiles on their faces. Hard to find that these days! The price though is the one thing that always seems to be a buzzkill on such a great lobster roll meal in Singapore: these meals don't come cheap as the lobsters are flown in live from halfway around the world. At S$58++, it is quite expensive. But if you keep it in perspective, it's a fairly reasonable price to pay for what you're getting considering you're in Singapore. It is worth noting that at Pince and Pints, the menu only consists of Lobster and only comes prepared 1 of 4 ways: grilled, steamed, on a roll or chili lobster - which actually looked like something I'll need to explore as it is their take on the ubiquitous chili crab dish. All dishes are priced at S$58++, which in an oddly good way means you'll never be left stressing over what to order based on price. A wicked good meal though, I'll be back for sure

My first experience having lobster meal in spore and it did not disappoint my tastebuds, they were fresh and cooked with optimal standards. Another thing that I appreciate most is the excellent staff's customer service that served you with a happy smile anytime! Efficient, friendly, thoughtful and knowledgeable. Also I was surprised that they actually gave me an complimentary drinks due to the fact that I had to wait for more than one hour to get an empty table. Bottom line, Will come back again in my next trip

There were only 3 items on the menu - Lobster Roll; Grilled or Steamed Live Lobster, and Chili Lobster with Mantou. Each was priced at $58++. We had the Grilled lobster (which came with fries) and the chilli lobster. It is preety steep but then, it is lobster. Delicious.  We had the chillie lobster which came with the fried buns. Delicious! The other was the grilled lobster also delicious. Maybe a little pricy
4
The menu is limited, but they make those few dishes really well. Had the lobster roll (favorite) & steamed lobster. Cocktails are really good too. Get there early to secure a spot.
4
food was good but it was a little pricey. had to wait for about 30minutes for a table even when we came in quite early, before 7pm.
staff was really patient in explaining the different dishes to us.

lobster was brilliant. simple menu and friendly staff. went back a second time to get another lobster fix. such great value for money!

There are no appetisers or deserts served here at this little restaurant and bar on Duxton Road. So I ordered all 3 mains on the menu. The Grilled Lobster was juicy and fresh served with fries and special sauce. The Chili Lobster was just like chili crabs served with fried man tous till the wait staff got confused himself and said "here's your chili crab, oops I meant lobster crab" Hahaha! Good thing it wasn't too spicy but probably good with beer (Asahi) which I had 2 eventually. My personal favourite has got to be The Lobster Roll. It's just delicious, you've got to give it a try at least once. Service was good too. I think Kean was his name and there was another girl (sorry i didn't get your name) who served us was cool and friendly. The only downside is some may find the mains a bit pricy but then again I'm not too familiar with the market on whether it's reasonable or not. Perhaps dine on special occasions

Decent lobsters at valuable price. We tried all 4 lobster dish available. Love the grilled lobster best! As for chilli lobster, coming from taste of view of Singapore Chilli crab eater, I think sauce is a little on the sweet side.All Lobsters are fresh and juicy! Even the bread for lobster roll was good! Nicely toasted and soft. Yum, yum!Modern industrial deco was ok, comfortable except air condition unit on top of us was leaking. We shifted to the next table. Service was acceptable, nice friendly people.Note: No reservations. We're there around 630pm and tables were available. It got crowded somewhere around 7pm and it's only Wednesday

Very reasonably priced with 3 sets at SGD49++. I tried the chilli lobster which tastes like chilli crab sauce. Came with 4 fried man tous which r Divine!! Can order extra. Loved the grilled lobster with fries too. Just didn't try lobster roll. No reservations then...hope they start lunch and take reservations soon

In the hard of China town on Duxton Road you'll find this great place to have lobster! Only three things on the menu to choose from where I like to believe the 'whole Lobster' (steamed or grilled) is the best choice. Around 600grams of fresh and juicy meet served with a small salat, fries and sauce. Limited amount of table but you can eat at the bar as well. Not a place to go for a romantic dinner as bright lights and loud music is not bringing it. Price is all fair and service is great

I love lobsters, don't you? You know the feeling of what it's like to fall in love AGAIN with something? Pince and Pints will do that to you! My personal favorite would be the lobster sandwich *crispy bread with a tint of sweetness and a healthy serving of delicious lobster with cheese dipping* I was in heaven~

First, it's a cramped and uncomfortable place. Then each customer is told you've got maximum one-and-a-half hours to have your meal. Have you ever heard of an upmarket pricey place saying that to its customers? This is a record! The grilled lobster was good. But it was hardly a meal; only an appetizer. OK lobters are expensive. And they are full of shell and other non-edible parts. But the small portions of fries and salad did not help. At $48 plus 17% taxes and extra charges, it is definitely not worth it. And oh, they've already announced an impending increase in prices. Another thing is that having only one dish (albeit in 3 styles) is not attractive for a restaurant. Restaurants that specialise in a single dish normally have a few other related dishes too

Those who are familiar with London's Burger & Lobster will find this place similar too (minus the burger). The live whole lobster (grilled/steamed), lobster roll are all the same and even presented similarly. However, since this is Singapore, they have added in the local favorite curry - curry lobster. I tried the grilled lobster and I should say it is not bad. Not really better or worse than the London one. Since their lobsters are air flown, some freshness is lost. But overall, it is still juicy and tender. The place is a bit small. Expect to queue a while if u come in group. Couples should be able to get a table quickly. Btw, all dishes are $48++. A bit pricey I feel.

this taste quite normal. any good zhi char shop can do a curry lobster dish too. drinks so so. if you need to fix your lobster crave, sheng shiong sells live lobsters at about $15 a piece.
5
We had the grilled lobster and lobster roll menu. Both were equally good and the lobsters were very fresh. Both sets came with fries and salad. There was a fish tank in the restaurant with an interesting live orange lobster in it.
5
Other then the notorious q, the food n ambience is really good. Value for money and also the service is GOOD!!

Decided to try out the place after a great review from my local friends, the place was full by 7.30pm and the folks arriving later had to dine at the bar the crowd was unreal.The place serves only 3 types of lobster meals at $48++. We had to try them all. Grilled lobster, steam lobster and chilli lobster. All dishes are really incredible delicious. Our ranges of lobsters were cooked to perfection. The meat was sweet and luscious with no hint of any devious taste. From arrival the service was outstanding and food was a great, in and all a prodigious experience. The ambiance was good and you can see the staff preparing the food through a glass panel. Service was quick and the food super fresh and plentiful. The staffs were super helpful and friendly but not disturbing. All in all, we had a great dinner experience. I cannot wait for my next visit

Finally there is a place in Singapore in case you do have a Lobster craving.Pince and Pints is a dedicated Lobster restaurant in Duxton road. No appetizer or dessert, Lobster is the star and they proposed it in 4 ways, Grilled or steam, Lobster roll and Chilli Lobster at an unique price of S$48++.As it’s in an old Shop House, it is a bit cramp and it will be quite noisy really quick inside.Negative or positive point, depend on you, they do not take reservation, walk-in only, meaning by 7pm it’s already full. well it can help, as locals love to queue ;). Don’t get me wrong, it can have some charm to it, but you are not sure to have a table when you’re hungry.Btw, it’s dinner only…more at: https://drinkeattrip.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/lobster-night-at-pince-and-pints

1st visit was in July 2014 when they just opened for business. Raving reviews. Restaurant could only sit 40 pax and no reservations can be made so my wife and I had to wait nearly 3 hours before we could get our tables. The service was great as the restaurant manager will share how the lobsters are freshly obtained direct from source and recommend drinks from their wide selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. I had the fuzz-free lobster roll while my wife had the steamed lobster. We both liked what was presented to us. Worth every cent as the lobsters each weighs roughly 600 grams and arrives fresh and alive from States. All the sauces are made fresh and from scratch. I could not drink as I was driving but they had really interesting mock tails and even cold-pressed juices. Back the 2nd time round during Christmas period and had the Christmas special menu of Lobster Thermidor

Saw the positive feedback in Tripadvisor and decided to try out the place with my wife. We reached there at 7.20pm. About 5 minutes later, the place was full and the folks arriving later had to dine at the bar - so go before 7.30pm, if you want tables.The place serve only lobster meals at $48++. I tried the grilled lobster and it was extremely fresh. It came with chips and a small portion of salad. The meat was sweet and succulent with no hint of any fishy smell. My wife had the lobster roll and thoroughly enjoyed it.The ambience was good and you can see the staff preparing the food through a glass panel. The staff was friendly and the service was quick.All in all, we had a great dinner experience there

Simple idea executed brilliantly, by keeping the menu really small the team at Prince and Pints are able to prepare perfect food. One of our key finds in Singapore, cant recommend it more highly, we had a great night. Staff are really good they keep it simple as well. Thanks we has a greet night

6 of us went for dinner to Pince and Pints. From arrival to the service and food was a great, great experience. Our range of lobsters were cooked to perfection. Service was quick and the food super fresh and plentiful.The staff were super helpful and friendly but not intrusive. This is an example of a great restaurant and is definitely a place we'll go back to time and time again

Has been reading a lot of review for Pince and Pints, time to go for a visit. No reservation, only walk-in. Was told by the waiting staff that the best timing to come is after 8.30pm when the queue is shorter. The menu is small, only lobsters. We ordered grilled lobster and chilli lobster. Both dishes are really incredible delicious. Both my wife and me enjoyed every bit of the food. Fresh, tasty and you just want more.My wife said that her favorite place for lobster. We intend to do a gathering next month. Great job to the Chef
