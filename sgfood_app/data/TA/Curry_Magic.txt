Familiar or not of Indian cuisine, you must come here and follow your instinct. You will be delighted with flavors, spices, and raffined cuisine. The menu is simple, the food absolutely delicious.

We have been there several times and are never disappointed. The chef really does create magic with the spices, creating flavorful Indian cuisine. Even my children who are not used to spices love their butter chicken.

I live nearby and I usually dismiss this place because it looked empty. But I finally went last week because a friend highly recommended it. I was pleasantly surprised to be proven so wrong. The food was both authentic and delicious. My coconut mild curry fish was tender, the butter chicken was good. I loved the mango lassi too. I do think the young wait staff need to practice how to make recommendations. Its a pity because no one seems to know this hidden gem. Do give this place a try, never judge a book by its cover and think the food will be bad just because it seems empty

I've been a fan of Chef Raju's cooking since 2007 when Curry Magic was still a small hawker stall operating out of a cafeteria at Toa Payoh North Industrial Estate. Ten years on and I've transitioned to a vegan diet, but I still love the food just as much, if not more so. The veg thali (served until 2.30pm) is my favourite - generous portions and rich flavours for a hearty and satisfying meal at an affordable price!This picture is of a special meal the chef prepared for me during a recent visit: veg briyani with a side of soya chunks in curry. Not a standard menu item, but a good example of the kind of culinary magic that they have to offer. Simply A1. :

The place somewhat reminded me of indian restaurants in Australia - not the usual buzzing indian restaurant feel you get in little india. But the food tasted so good, this particular fish dish that comes wrapped in the leaf was just out of this world that it finished so fast we ordered again. There was nothing that we ordered we were feeling average about, everything was good, some were great and i had 2 personal favourites - the fish and the appam! Even my grannies who are not much of food explorers enjoyed the food very much. Also - I would like to give a thumbs up that we had ordered a mango lassi after the bill was settled and they so graciously gave it to us on the house. Shout out to the restaurant for being so gracious! Very home feel. Will definitely be back with more friends and family :

Very homely and geniune Kerala food. Ambience is really homely and cozy. Not crowded at all (not many people of heard this place). Prices reasonable and no GST!Curries are flavourful and authentic, not too spicy and not too heavy. Suitable for non- curry lovers even

It was our first visit and had a great tasting and enjoyable dinner. We had the mutton brayani, spicy fish curry and a veggie fish. Quality and taste of dishes were superb at very reasonable prices . However, the outlet was short of staff and we waited quite a while for food. If you don't mind waiting for great tasting Indian cuisine , then check out this place

Went for early dinner. The restaurant is rather warm and we had to request for them to look at that as we have an infant who is getting cranky. They did try but was still warm so we had to bring the baby out. Food is average. Curry magic fish was very spicy and the Bryani rice was wet. Garlic nann has too little garlic. The cheese nann was however very good. Portion rather small.

I am active in searching new Indian food places and came across this place on google map search.Asked my family to go and went there to try out.Noticed that this place is run by a family and all family members are engaged in various services (even a small kid who was taking order).Ambience was goodLooks like a family friendly place.Service was ok (little slow in my case) but food was good.Mid to High range price and location is very inside the estate. Have to walk a lot to locate and come out from the place if you do not have your own transportation.Overall very good experience. Might visit again

Family run restaurant with excellent home style Indian food! Need to be patient though as service staff is limited to the family's 2 young sons.

Went with my family on an evening. Interior of the Curry Magic restaurant have a typical Kerala (South Indian State) taste.. We had Squid as a started, spicy yummy dish.. For Main we tried Appam with Chichen and a Fish curry prepared in coconut milk.. for Appam this med spicy fish is a good match.. the food is of good Quality, from the taste we can say they use quality ingedients.. Price is not cheap but reasonable for that genuine taste.

Great food, service and ambience! Although was here for lunch, i think this is also a perfect place to wind down after work

A wonderful place to dine at. They receive guests with great hospitality and serve delicious Kerala-Malabari cuisine. The food and ambience make you feel like you are right back in Kerala. Thank you Curry Magic. Wish you all success

Went today for lunch. We arrived 30 minutes before the end of the lunch service but they very kindly offered to stay open later for us. We ordered a variety of chicken dishes and add ons. Everything was delicious and suitable for children. The gentleman serving was extremely welcoming and kind and we will definitely come back. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Excellent food at a very good price
