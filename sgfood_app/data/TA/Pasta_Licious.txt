A small, cozy place, relaxed atmosphere. Really tasty pasta, we just loved it!
We had travelled in Asia for over two weeks and had had our share of rice and noodles so this was exactly what we wanted.

We were looking for a more "European style food" restaurant in the Chinatown area of Singapore, go figure! Our teens were a bit tired of Asian food and wanted pizza etc and we were lucky enough to see the Pasta Licious sign on the main Chinatown food strip pointing down a side street to their 3 Temple street entrance, right at the back of the Indian temple that everyone photographs around the corner. The restaurant has been open for a month or so and the young owner had to choose a less tourist trodden street due to the high rents in downtown Singapore. Nonetheless Kelda as she is named has not scrimped on ingredients nor the quality of her cooking. We were impressed by her service, fine ingredients such as high quality cheese, great beef, excellent ice cream etc. She even has Root Beer for us "Americans" who grew up with that strange to the rest of the world flavor. She has beer and wine too of course at regular Singapore prices. We went twice as a family and also saw groups of teens and adult tourists eating there. KeldaÂ´s pizzas are thin crust Itailan style, her hamburgers are thick American style and her desserts are delicious, from brownies to Korean Bingsu and lots in between, Overall delicious and if you are looking for a great "Western" place at reasonalbe prices go to Pasta licious. They also offer set menus for lunch at what seem to be pretty cheap prices
