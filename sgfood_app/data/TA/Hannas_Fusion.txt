A rare gem which we will definitely return. Their katsu don $10 is very yummy and highly valued for money. Both my hubby and daughter love it. I had their steak, very decent for the price. Zen place ^^

I've ordered from Hanna's Fusion for the 5th time now. Food was great! Had their Japanese burgers, ebi rice and also the chicken katsu rice

This is a good place to try novel food options. People who love to explore and mix and match would be at home at this place.
