The BBQ sting ray here was prettt standard. What impressed me was their BBQ sotong which in my humble opinion, is the best in Singapore. Their sotong was cooked to perfection, smooth and soft and with the chili to go along, its heavenly!

Hidden gem around west coast area.
My regular fix for BBQ stingray craving as their bbq stingray is so fresh.
Stir-fried vegetable is good, not overcooked. Totally oishii!!
The price is acceptable.
2nd time i went there, the owner already knew what i want.

Best BBQ seafood ever tried!!!!!Love the specially prepared chillis dip for seafood and everything taste so flavourful with the chillis sauce dip. From what i understand, this stall is pioneer (if not one of the 1st few) in Singapore that sell BBQ seafood, stingray in singapore. Really feel great to have a taste one of Singapore authentic pioneer creation food dishe

This is the best grilled seafood in Singapore, and it's mainly due to the fact that its ingredients are super fresh and the price is clearly stated. I would really recommend you to try this place and it's definitely a good place to bring any foreign friends to try this version of seafood that they serve. Must try dishes include: stingray, oyster egg, squid. Their vegetables are also amazingly fresh so it's a good all rounded meal. Gem hidden in this hawker centre

Had visitors from Philippines and brought them to try out some local food in the market. Visited this stall around 8pm, and tried their Fried Oyster Egg, Grill Squid, Grill Fish, Fried Sea Shell LA-LA and Grill Giant Prawn. Very yummy for all the dishes, spicy yet flavorful. Recommended to try if nearby and definitely worth the wait for the seafood

The preparation method (BBQ) may appear simple, but that's where the difficulty comes - the seafood has to be fresh to begin with! Love the uber tender stingray and ikan kurau, that softness...oh my...*slurps* We also had crabs, prawns, crayfish, oyster omelette... and interestingly, sausage fried rice. 就是新鲜的海鲜才那么赞

Tokyo BBQ just name related to Japan, but their delicious recipe totally in Singapore Local Taste. Try their Fried Oyster Egg, Grill Squid, Grill Fish, Fried Sea Shell LA-LA, Grill Giant Prawn and Fried Sambal KangKung Vegetable (little spicy level), damn delicious! They serving very fresh seafood, eat with specialized dip sauce and chillies sauce, can refill 3 bowl of thai white rice. Usually need to wait around 20min after order, all fresh cook on the spot, and full of customer order. When goes to this hawker food court, almost 60% of table will order from Tokyo BBQ. go and try, and really worth to wait for 20min, MUST EAT in Singapore
