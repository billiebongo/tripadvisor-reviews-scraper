This is my favourite Hokkien Mee in Singapore. Tasty with reasonable price, in my most visited hawker center. I travelled from north to this place at least once a month for this Hokkien Mee for my weekend breakfast. Highly recommended! Must try!

Their Hokkien prawn mee is very tasty and moist, just the way I like it! They are also quite generous on the prawns - A $3 plate comes with about 4. The sambal chilli also goes very well with the noodles.

This is everything I like in my hokkien mee. The chilli is great, there is enough gravy but not too much, the noodles are not too chewy, and it's a good mix of yellow noodles and vermicelli.

Although it's a very common local dish, this stall is one of the better ones in Toa payoh area. I had it once in a blue moon and I never get sick of it.

Chef has won numerous food awards and has been featured in Mandarin food shows. the hokkien mee taste best when eaten there at the market. the texture and flavour is wonderfully delicious. Have to eat this once every few months!

the food is good and smell nice but the quality of the prawn can be better improved. Overall the soup base is thick with nice prawn favours.

The taste is average. There are others that are similar eg at Simon Road , at Kovan . It's just ok ok . Wouldn't go all the way to have just this. But this food centre is a big one with other nice food like fish soup , and pau . So having this Hokkien Mee as a communal plate is an acceptable idea.

Come Daily Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee had sort of gain an household foothold with its style of fried hokkien prawn mee, as hokkien mee is a common local dish thus it's hard to find a good hokkien mee food stall.The texture of the hokkien mee was really good and also the portion of the prawn was also rather generous! One must be wondering what's the secret behind the recipe for such a delicious local dish.This is highly recommended for anyone who likes fried hokkien prawn mee

I did not eat the hokkien mee for a few months from this stall, and this time when I went back, I felt that the taste is even better. It will be better if they can improve on their chillie, making it more spicy. They have increase the price of the noodle to $4 per plate. But it's ok as costs also increased and most important the taste is good.Keep it up with the good work!!

One of my favorite singapore food is Fried Hokkien mee. I had been eaten the fried hokkien mee from this stall for many years. Most of the hokkien mee stall nowadays do not add in pork lard for health choice. The mee from this stall taste really great and the pork lard really make a difference from other fried hokkien mee. The taste do not need any chilly to add point for it. Itself is already very fragrance and delicious. The noodle are not too dry nor too wet, it is just nice. And also, the portion is quite okay for a $3 plate of noodle. Go and have a try

The one at Yshun Interchage tastes great but only when the man cooks. The crispy lard is a little flat, though.

The only reason I come here for hokkien prawn mee is because they do it the way I like it - wet and moist.
I am never sure of its opening time or days - sometimes it's open; sometimes not. Just take the chance.
