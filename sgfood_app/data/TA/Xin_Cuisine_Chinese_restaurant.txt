We had a wonderful dinner at Xin, even though they got an order wrong (got us 2 portions instead of 1). We started off with the soup of the day which had a wonderful stock and was full of ingredients (exotic mushrooms, dried scallops, chicken, pork, abalone). Next came the wagyu beef cubes (tender!), vegetable in stock (stock was a bit salty) and baked perch (this was the one that came in 2 portions instead if the 1 we ordered, but because it was so tasty, we didn't mind. Service was also professional and efficient. Recommended.

I like the menu and the food was good. Value for money and there are very interesting dishes. I enjoyed it
4
Ambience of restaurant is good and food is tasty. Reasonable price and will definitely visit again. Good
5
We went here for dinner on our first night in Singapore. We were wanting dim sum but they only serve dim sum at lunch. With the help of the staff we were able to choose 3 very good dishes to share. I especially liked the chicken dish with the cashews. It was a little expensive but worth it. I also recommend the tiger beer
3
Dining experience was generally satisfactory. After our feedback on one of the dishes, the manager was very apologetic about it and quick to wanting to change for another dish
5
First the ambience in the restaurant was good, and I love the prompt services by the staff. Good food recommendation by the kinki for us, group of 5 girls. The portion was just nice and Food was really awesome, especially the duck and the soup! Appreciate the extra service by Ivy, it was my birthday when we visited the restaurant and they prepared a cake for me. Will definitely visit the restaurant again!

First experience at this restaurant left a lasting impression on me. When me and my friends entered the restaurant we were quickly and efficiently brought to our seats, after which we were given the menu for us to order the dishes, many of the dish looked mouth-watering and we were at a lost on what to order. Fortunately, a staff/manager, Ivy, was there to assist us and gave us various recommendations on the restaurant's signature dishes. Throughout the meal Ivy was very attentive, she constantly refilled our tea. Another mark of excellent service by Ivy was when she realised that we really enjoyed the appetizer and took the initiative to help us get another serving of appetizer. Her good service has left a lasting impression on me and she should be a role model to all service staff. The service at this restaurant has made this experience extremely memorable, me and my friends had a great time there and we will definitely be back again soon!

Had dim sum here for lunch. Everything was great! The dishes were spot on. If anything can be improved, it is the service as dishes were really slow to serve. But overall a good experience
5
The service by Manager Ivy was excellent! She ensured everything was in place for my cousinâ€™s birthday celebration from recommending dishes, ensuring the dishes only came when everyone has arrived and even checking with us if the food was alright! :) Would definitely come back again!
5
Food was again delicious and service excellent. Manager Alvin and team provide made good recommendation and attentive services throughout the meal...well done once again..
4
Food was good but for the price, it's not as worth. We used the membership card so it was a 25% discount. Ambience was good and staff were great!
5
The food was delicious and the level of service was also excellent. The assistant manager Carmen Lee was very hospitable and helped us gave us good recommendation and also help quickly get our food prepared. 5 star

My family of 10 visited Xin cuisine located at HolidayInn Atrium for a birthday celebration.We booked the Private Dining Room and was pleasantly surprise by the elegant decor and spaciousness.The service was attentive and very thoughtful..providing shawls to the ladies who felt cold and a cute toy car for the toddler. The waitress who served us was knowledgeable and provided good recommendations.The best part was the food! We ordered the signature dishes and were blown away dish after dish. We started with beautifully prepared soup, served in individual portions so we tried a few different soups. My favourite was the cordycep, fish maw broth which was flavourful. The tea leaf duck and roast pork were tasty and done well. The Yuzu prawns and sea perch with miso sauce were DELICIOUS and I would definitely return for these dishes. The only dish that we did not enjoy much was the Claypot rice, as it lacked flavour. The price of the meal commensurates the good quality of food.. will definitely recommend Xin cuisine to anyone who appreciates good Cantonese food.

Went to Xin Cuisine last night for dinner with family for the first time. The staff service was very good. Ordered roast pork, signature duck, fish soup, and some veg. Overall food were ok except for the Kai Lan with Ginger soup which was too salty. Best regardsTon
3
The rice rolls was thicker than my face. Honestly the food doesn't meet up to my expectation. The signature duck with tea leave was average. Congee portion way too small. Omg the xiao long bao pork smells like something gone bad inside the pork. Not sure it it's mixed with salted fish. Not my kind of dim sum. Only thing nice was the lime sorbet desert and barbecue pork bun
4
Good food must be a reasons why Xin has been around for many years.Ambience has been updated but nothing really outstanding or lavish. Still very comfortable.Service wasn't refined and elegant, but was friendly and welcoming.Food:Ginseng Chicken Soup - A very fine soup, though not the best.Scotland Peking Duck - Outstanding duck quality, Peking duck wrapper was on the thick side.Ginger Kai Lan - Not the best dish of the eveningStir-fried Pork Neck in XO Sauce - Star of the show. Would definitely order this on every return visit.Grilled Perch with Miso - Good quality fish, well-executed, slightly small portion.Lemongrass Jelly with Lime Sorbet - Quite a refreshing palate cleanser.Prices are definitely on the very high side. Expect to spend upwards of S$65 per person, including taxes
5
Dim sum very fresh & nice food presentation. Many varieties of dim sum. Service staff very polite. We did not order from the ala Carte menu but will visit again
4
I celebrated my birthday with my family here. Booking was easy with their online reservation system. Service was great. We ordered dim sum and some ala Carte dishes. Must try is the roast duck tea leaves immersed. The duck was succulent and non-greasy. The dim sum arrived timely. They had no problem with the birthday cake we brought. Sang the birthday song for me! All in all we had a great time. Thank you Xin for making my birthday special!
4
Located on the 4th floor of the Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium, this Chinese restaurant serves very good Chinese food and is fairly priced in pleasant surroundings
4
We enjoyed our meal there especially their signature dish- Poached Rice with Seafood broth. The overall service was good and the serving time was efficient. We finished our meal within 40 minutes. It was pretty fast
4
Tucked away in Havelock Road is this gem of a restaurant. Serving up authentic Cantonese cuisine which is both delicious and affordable.. Good ambience and service as well
5
Came on a public holiday for lunch. Restaurant was full but staff never fail to deliver efficient services as usual. Although they were working on a fast pace, but still always served with a smile...Great Job
4
The servers were extremely patient and when we needed extra utensils or extra orders, they undertook without feeling troubled or irritated.
5
This is an expensive option but if you love non vegetarian food then do try their duck and pork preparations. The food is superior in taste and the service is impeccable. Do not miss if you are staying in this hote
5
Great food, e bbq meat platter is a must order. Awesome service provided by e staff too, especially from Alvin. You can surely trust him for food recommendations. Highly recommended

Xin is usually one of our favourite place for dinner. Somehow tonight dinner was poor. Keep in mind that we have a 80+ lady with us.Sevice was seen as the poorest time as none attend to us from we sat down at a table. Waited for good 8-10mins for a waitress to approach us for asking the drink and hand in the menu.We were curious about its National Day promotion of crab, so we made an order. Was told that it will be 1.1kg weight but the dish served to us did not tally with the said weight. Chilli sauce taste was good as we told them not to make so spicy. Main point was that the meat crab was not meaty at all. Expressed twice to waitress and manager/superviosr regarding the quality, the manager/supervisor simply replied would feedback to sipplier?!Good thing we had Eatigo discount but still feel that the experience was at the bottom
5
Compare to my last visit here about a year ago, great improvement in term of food and services. Old staff with new management shown great service and excellent food selection. Hope that the standard can maintain for long...Keep it up...
5
Nice food, good services, nice place, nice people, especially the student intern Mr. Brian Zeyu, nice guy. Strongly recommended
5
Decoration was good and staffs are all friendly. Fish is fresh and tasty, good place for family and friend
5
Came here for a family dinner and was bowled over by the wonderful service of the staff and the creative, special menu created. The staff was incredibly attentive and the chef also came over personally to check on how we found the food, very nice touch. The dishes were great, especially the coffee ribs and claypot rice. Would recommend this restaurant for Cantonese fine dining.
5
Lovely and excellent cuisine!! Highly impressed with Chef Dennis and Chef Lee's dishes!! Also great service by the staff here. My favourites are the coffee pork ribs and the coconut abalone soup! Highly creative dishes which look great too! Strongly recommended for family dinners
5
Beijing duck, sea braised cucumber tofu, fried chicken, steamed seafood beehoon. These are the few dishes that I highly recommend. Good value, nice food. We like Chef Lee and Chef Daniel Teo recommendations. They are full of creativity. Excellent service team led by Alvin, Ivy, Carmen. Received excellent service from them.
4
Was at Xin for last sunday dim sum lunch with family.the dim sum was excellent& the signature roast duck with tea leaves too.staff cheerful & efficient.I found Carmen the assistant manager very helpful & attentive.we enjoyed the experience & definitely return for more meal
5
Was here last week with family. Very traditional Cantonese cuisine served in a warm and friendly restaurant. Staff always willing to assist whenever we wanted somethings. Manager Alvin and teams provide an excellent dining experience throughout our meal. He shared with us a lot of food knowledge which you can hardly find in other restaurant. Great job and will come back for more visits... Keep it up..
5
Xin has been my go-to place to satisfy my craving for Cantonese cuisine for almost two years; the food is consistently good regardless of time and day of the week, and the staff are always warm, friendly and helpful, much like a family. Their innovative style adds variety and surprise to typical dim sum and Cantonese dishes. My favourite alacarte items are their 避风塘烧鸡 (roast chicken) and 烧味三拼 (trio barbecue plate).
5
The food here was amazing and I would really visit again! The staff were so kind and friendly, greeting us with a bright smile across their faces. The dishes they serve are of top notch quality, extremely fresh and hot. I can't help but write this feedback as their service were really fabulous! I would like to specially compliment Carmen, Ivy and Kinki. They were so courteous and never hesitated to serve us! Great job!
4
Like the restaurant, the food and the staff. Price is very competitive and the spacing between tables is comfortable. Though the location is a bit out of the way but there will be an MRT close by soon
4
We had a very good dinner tonight with friends . Xin Cruisine 's service is great , thanks Carmen and Ivy for the great introduction of new dishes: we had yellow tailed fish on clay pot, truffle mee poh , all very well done . We finished with a plate of very cute Merlion manto ( compliments from the house ). The cook is of good standard . Highly recommended.
5
Their must try dish is their tea leaf roast duck. It's the most fragrant roast duck I've ever seen and the tea leaf infusion makes it a very unique Cantonese roast duck unlike any others. Another dish I really enjoy is their Yusu infused prawns. It's tangy sweet and sour with a slightly crusty exterior and is really superb. Your dining experience will be made even more special by the staff members they employ. I've become a regular there and I've come to know them well. Their supervisory staff of Alvin, Carmen and Ivy are all great people who makes the extra effort to ensure you'll have a great time. All the other supporting staff are also great people
5
Had our friends gathering at Xin Cuisine recently. was recommended by a friend of ours to give it a try. We all love the claypot tanghoon, steamed chicken with mushroom and Chinese sausages which was recommended by Alvin. Great service, always ensuring our requests are met. Will definitely go back again
4
Delicious and affordable if using the Amex Platinum Card. Very nice atmosphere and comfortable seating. Look forward to my next visit
3
Menu was interesting but food came out quite salty. Service was bad had to ask for tea refills everytime and plate changes. The food came out all at once until we had to request them to hold. Dishes are quite pricey with many charged by per portion basis
3
Had the sheng mian and asparagus. Waitress recommended rose tea and I reluctantly gave it a try. I'm a breastfeeding mum, so I actually requested for non caffeine drinks but they don't offer.The sofa was very relaxing and they provided a setting for my baby. The prawns were really fresh but I didn't find the noodle okay. It was supposed to be crispy but came dense and hard. Then i ended up soaking all the noodle in the soup to be able to bite into it. Asparagus was yummy but for a small serving the price is quite high
4
7 of us are here for $250.We had the tea duck, pork neck with mushroom, a chicken dish (yummy) fried rice, fried tofu and a delicious soup. Service was ok, professional but no smiles..Give it a go for the duck.
3
The decor and the service are the same as compared to my last visit years ago, however, the tastiness of the foods (dim sum) is no longer the same.It was a late morning on a Saturday when I brought my family there for dim sum, the whole restaurant was so quiet with only one other table of two guests. This probably explains why the service was still good and commendable. We ordered several dim sum dishes, and they took a long while to serve and I thought the restaurant still practice "steam as you order" that's why we have to wait for our dim sum. This gives you the feeling and expectation that the dim sums must be fresh and hence tasty. Yes, the dim sums were fresh and tasty as they were steamed only when you ordered, that's when I last visited years ago, but they are no longer the same during my recent visit. Not only the taste of their dim sums have deteriorated, but the serving size have also varied, for example, the cut slice of their roasted meats were big cut and huge, it will be too much a mouth full for a slice; their "Siew Mai" and "Har Kou" were also huge that you need at least two to three bites to consume. "Liu Sa Pau" were okay, but the taste of their "Xiao long pau" was something beyond a normal expectation. The most disappointing dish would be their "dumpling", to me it is over cooked, the rice was like a bunch of paste, it is very expensive and really not value for money, While most of their dishes were hugely made or sliced, I find their serving of "porridge" too petite and small as compared to most other restaurants. Honestly I was quite disappointed with the taste of the foods as they were no longer the same as compared to my last visit, and I guess this could be because the chefs are no longer the same. Notwithstanding that, the service standard are still the same which made a dim sum lunch still a pleasant one.
5
Excellent seafood fried rice. Veggies perfectly cooked and the pork dishes are amazingly good. DImsum was very yummy and to top things off the Chinese Tea was both delicate and refreshing. I definitely recommend you try the Xin cuisine
5
I went to Xin for the first time with my husband and mother and were very happy with the service and food. The tea leave duck was better than expected and the yam basket mixed vegetables was delicious
5
We had the best experience here ... food is delicious and the service is excellent. A big thank you to Carmen, the Assistant Manager for recommending the sesame balls with champagne chocolate fillings.
5
Enjoyed my dim sum meals with my family. Ordered both from Dim Sum List and Menu and food turn out great. Some dishes are creative and yet tasty to
5
The waitress was very professional. She was able to recommend the dishes based on our liking and helped us chose the right amount of food.The food, such as suckling pig (in platter), fish, lobster soup, etc. were delicious.
4
Had business lunch last week and enjoyed the food here especially their speciality roast duck and the crispy roast pork that I brought my family over the weekend to have our dinner. Their dim sum was good and serve in very unique plating.All the 7 dishes that we have ordered for our dinner, which includes the above 2 dishes, are delicious and thoroughly palatable.Will definitely come back again to try other dishes on the menu
4
Been at Xing just a few weeks ago after I haven't there for 3 years. The place used to be better but it's still good. Pekin duck should be sliced by the chef but it wasn't on that day since there were a lot of people around. It seems like the menu stayed the same - very Chinese, very traditional. I would recommend going if you're staying at HI Atrium
4
Easy to book restaurant with good food at a valued priced.. air con was abit down therefore a lil warm but overall great to experience..
4
Had dim sum with my cousins on Sunday and it was a pleasant experience.Some interesting spin to old classics but still good! Just don't expect run of the mill stuff! Excellent presentation and unique flavour pairings!Service was efficient and exuded warmth and professionalism. Small requests for additional plates, condiments were fulfilled in good time and always with a smile despite a busy lunch crowd!Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants under the radar! And very affordable too! Will be returning to try dinner soon!

I recently brought my family to Xin Cuisine on the date 04 December 2016, Sunday, 745pm. Yet to our suprise, we were at the receiving end of very poor service at your restaurant by Ms Carmen. On the said date, we placed our food order according to Ms Carmen's recommendations of the restaurant's signature dishes. We specifically instructed Ms Carmen on the special requirements for our food, but was taken aback when the food were served not according to our required specifications. We did a feedback with Ms Carmen, but instead of apologizing and rectifying her mistakes, she pretended to avoid the issue and sneaked away from the situation. My family was absolutely offended and appalled by such behaviour and lost the mood and appetite to have a happy dinner together as a family.We wrote a feedback to Xin Cuisine and hope their management will take effort to look into this matter and ensure such an incident is not repeated.
5
Good dimsum and a la carte menu from this original Hong Kong restaurant.We really enjoyed the food and attentive service
5
Had lunch with my family Here. The food was amazing. To try their signature prawns with scallops and their ee fu noodles with waxed sausages. The sesame rice ball filled with liquor is a must try as well. Worth the price and definitely be back to try their other dishes.
1
Thank heavens we didn't go for the dim sum buffet and ordered a la carte dim sum instead. Except for the wide variety of the not so common dim sum on offer and the presentation, the taste is probably akin to the food court dim sum. It's also expensive. Service is practically non-existent! Unless you have heaps of time to spare, it's a lengthy wait for food. The attitude of service staff is appalling. Expect to be greeted with an expression of irritation and the world owes them attitude when asking for a table. Even the very basic Chinese restaurant service of topping up your tea is non-existent. It's my first time here but it would also be my last
3
The dim sum is average , not much surprised for me. Can be improved on it. The main dishes from the dim sum selection is very good and nice, which can order one time. The dish is nice and it came hot. One of the service staff(male) is not very attentive, need to be alert. All other staff is good and well delivered their service.
4
A good lunch option. I would recommend the Xiao Long Bao, the scallop dumpling and the bacon & crabclaw. Didn't enjoy the buns so much, too much flour.Also do try the prawn noodle dish
4
Food was amazing! All the recommendations was perfect although I wasn't able to try the chicken dish because I have cough (Chinese belief ) Staff were all friendly although I don't understand much of what they're saying as they often explain in Chinese. Luckily I have my Chinese speaking friends who translates for me. Suckling pig was my fave! We also had a chance to taste all their best selling mooncakes. What an experience with the durian one! Not so bad though. I'm just not a fan. Sorry. But it's a great place for family or group dinner.
5
Good food served in a nice surroundings. The Chili crab was the highlight and went down very well.there was a delay in bringing out the dishes all at once but that was probably our fault as we should have said the meals were separate. We enjoyed the food and would return again when in the city.Nice way to celebrate the Wedding anniversary, but I am not going to wait another 25 years to return
4
Second time I've been back here; this time to try the 6-Course Dinner. The last visit was for a Dim Sum buffet. The dinner was equally impressive and the surprisingly filling. Although the menu changes every month or so, I had the opportunity to taste the White Asparagus 6-course menu below: 1. Scallop with Mango Sauce Accompanied with Prawn (香芒酱带子伴脆米虾)2. Double-Boiled Chicken Soup with Sea Whelk and White Asparagus (白芦笋鲜螺炖鸡汤)3. Braised 5-head Abalone with Pan-fried Foie Gras (香煎鹅肝烩5头鲍鱼)4. Baked Stuffed Crab Shell in French Style (法式焗蟹盖)5. Braised Thick Noodles with Mushroom and Truffle Oil (松露油松菇焖面卜)6. Teochew Yam Paste with Ginkgo Nut (白果芋泥)With a pot of Chrysanthemum tea, this dinner for 2 sets us back at S$240 although the per pax price was $88++ each. Overall, with the excellent ambience coupled with soft nostalgic music and scrumptious serving, Xin Cuisine is certainly a place to impress your guests
5
I had the steamed chicken with dates and fungus. Also had the chicken with tiny bok choy soup. The lime sorbet with aloe Vera and lemongrass jello was new to me and very refreshing
5
Their signature dishes are always delicious and they regularly post daily specials on the lifts. Room service is also available. On the pricey side but well worth it.
5
One of the best dim sum restaurants in town for a hotel. In fact, one of the few in town which is not halal.They have great dim sum, especially their Lau Sa Pao. They also have great har kao with succulent prawns.The restaurant is always busy but the service is never compromised. Although they are not to the level where the tea cups are always topped up, but they are very attentive whenever you wave you hand. Considering the crowd they get, it is quite good
3
Heard of Xin Cuisine for the longest time and yet never really made it for dinner there. Finally settled for a CNY dinner with a set menu. Decor at the restaurant entrance was welcoming but was already put off by the strong stench of cigarette smoke in the elevator and corridor. No thanks to the karaoke pub upstairs.. We had great service from Ralph and his staff albeit the dishes were rather slow to appear. The tea leaves duck was v good. The other dishes in the set was OK. I must say the portions are generally more generous than most other similar class Chinese restaurants. Somehow I don't get the delicate and fine dining taste and presentation in most of the dishes. The noodles was unexpectedly spicy and could have been more Q
3
The food was ok, not excellent. I was expecting good vegetarian cuisine and I am not impressed. Other meal for example mushrooms and fish was good. Not bad for service
3
Visited this restaurant last night for some chinese grub as i did not want to go outside the hotel due to the intense haze, complements of Indonesia. The restaurant is pretty boring to say the least as far as decor goes.....not very inviting at all. The staff are not very welcoming at all. They just grunt at you.......we were seated, literally thrown a couple of menus and they left. We called them back to order our food, which they took.....a few minutes later food started to appear, all at once.....the staff literally dumped the food on the table and left, no words spoken at all.......all very rude, weird and no communication with us at all......even when paying the bill, they just put the bill on the table without a single word spoken.....I have to saw even though the atmosphere is terrible and the service woefully bad that the food was actually very good, the duck and apple was fabulous, the veggies were fresh and tasty and the desserts were amazing.....Its a pity because this place could be really a great place to go to for chinese food .....given its in a hotel!I would have to think twice about coming back here, if i did it certainly would not be for the joyous communication and interaction with the staff!!
4
Located on the 4th floor of the Holiday Atrium the restaurant serves authentic Cantonese Chinese Cuisine. The mushrooms are great and the waiters are knowledgeable to the way they can help you get something that you like out of the menu. Vegetarians can get a good menu too.
5
we recently had a food tasting dinner with my whole family and my future in law.the menu from first dish to dessert was great! and we all enjoy the food! it was tasty and delicious. The jellyfish and the duck on the first dish was really nice! the Fish was also very fresh and tasty!! overall i have to say it is worth it.Now i will have confident that our guests will enjoy themselve with the food on that Special Day
4
Ordered their signature duck and it was scrumptious as promised. The Prawns were good too and so were the noodles and the fried rice. We were staying at the holiday inn. The reception miscommunicated the timings of the restaurant on the weekend but still the staff accommodated us and got our food promptly. Good food and nice ambiance
4
If one can personify Xin Cuisine's standard or cooking and service, it will definitely be a Quiet Achiever. The quality of cooking and service should rank it as one of the top Cantonese restaurant in this city. Unfortunately it's less than central location in a not too new Holiday Inn is its Achilles heel. Every single dish we had was superbly and elegantly prepared and accompanied by attentive service. Since its CNY season, we also partook a scrumptious Peng Cai (Claypot dish) that was layered with fresh and luxurious delicacies in every bite. The cooking style is balanced and well executed and not adulterated by any fanciful fusion cooking which frequently end up horribly wrong elsewhere. Would have given them full marks if the non-existence manager knew how to manage the noisy Mainland PRC group that made such a raucous at the beginning of our meal
5
We went there today for business lunch as the intention was to share a nice crispy duck and some dumplings. I have to say the duck was delicious and also the service was perfect. The waiter even explained me the receipe of the duck and how they prepare it with different kind of teas. Now its my secret...you need to go there and ask them yourself! ;-)Conclusion: I definetely come back as it was not crowded, the food very good and the service friendly and personal
5
It was quite by accident that we ended up for lunch at this restaurant. In Singapore where the options of dining out are aplenty, the last thing you would choose is the restaurant in the hotel you are staying in! We were pressed for time and so by default walked into Xin Cusine for what turned out to be the best culinary experience. The somewhat spicy beef was outstanding as was the prawns and the fried rice and mixed vegetables. The flavour and taste made one lust for more! The service was courteous and the ambience pleasant
4
The food is very nice. I am told that the duck and the chiili crab are to die for.( I had the vegetarian). The restaurant was empty on this Wednesday night but our food was rather slow.
5
When our close friend initiated to bring us to Xin Cuisine for birthday celebration,my first thought (based on the name), could it be Western & Chinese fusion?On actual day, I discovered It's Chinese Cuisine with a Very relaxing ambience!The food was very tasty- It would be one of the few places I will host my overseas or local friends to Chinese cuisine in future (Hua Ting, Tien Court, Etc).Whatever we ordered tasted great! Be it Meat, Vegetable, Soup, Etc!The staff were friendly, provided great service, and a relaxing surrounds for family & friend gathering. One of the few restaurants I felt so relaxed!We will be back again & again!Be sure to check out this relaxing place with yummy Chinese cuisine @Xin Cuisine Chinese RestaurantOutram Road, Holiday Inn Atrium, Singapore 169075Call 6731 7173 to make a reservationEnjoy!For other recommendations of yummy food, you may check out my food blog:http://jasonhanis.blogspot.s

Had a good weekend brunch with the family here. The food was average, something to expect from hotel restaurant but what made it the more enjoyable dining experience was the service and ambiance. Doesn't get crowded here so you are assured of quality time with family. 4-stars for the great overall dining experience

Tried Xin Cuisine at Holiday Inn Atrium for the very first time with a Groupon voucher for "eat all you can" dim sum and was appalled with both the food as well as non-existent service levels. Walked into the restaurant and there were no waiting staff around to get us a table. The Chinese couple who came after us just walked ahead and called out to a waiting staff who then attended to them because they called her. That was utterly rude and it wasn't until I made it known to her that we were ushered to a table. No "hi" or "hello" or "welcome". Lady just showed us to our table and expected that we know what to do. After we figured out on our own that we had to fill out the order sheet and pass it to someone, we had to try hard to get the attention of one of the waiting staff. None of them seem like they wanted to be there. Whether it's poorly paid or bad management I don't know but service levels were non-existent. And after passing the lady our order, we sat there and waited....and waited...and waited. The food eventually arrived when my patience ran out and I was about to call someone over and yell at them. Food quality was horrendous. The fried stuff were too greasy and overly salty. We only ordered the friend stuff because the steamed stuff were so limited. The restaurant sort of decides what dishes to give you more of and which ones less of. The more expensive dishes came in minuscule servings which the crap ones came in massive servings. The mannerism in which they serve food shows the lack of etiquette. So many of them just plonk the dish by the side of the table and then walk off without uttering a word. Throughout the whole sitting no one asked if we wanted tea which I thought goes hand in hand with yum cha. They managed to forget a couple of the dishes that we ordered so we told them don't bother. What it shows me is that this joint is staffed by people who really don't want to be there, have no motivation to work and have little respect for themselves and their jobs. They're best to stay home every day rather forcing themselves to work on a Sunday and delivering rubbish for service and food. Will never ever recommend this place to anyone and if anyone asks, I will be sure to let them know how bad this place is

It sells chinese food and the service is good. I like the hot pot which is very delicious. It is clean and good value for mone
