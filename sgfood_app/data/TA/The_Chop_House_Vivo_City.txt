The recommended BBC beef burger was tasty. General dim lighting makes for a romantic atmosphere, but bad lighting for taking pictures. Service was alright and I would recommend it to a friend.
4
Overall experience was good. They even remembered and surprise the birthday boy. However, even with reservation there was a Long queue created outside but there were no one attending to it. There was no waiter at sight. For your consideration on more hires. Thanks!

It was my first visit to the Chop House and it exceeded my expectations with really awesome ambience and good food! Definitely going again!
4
We visit this restaurant for late lunch.
They have smoking area! And outside seat more for chill.
It was good steak.
3
Steak was small & pricey, mac & cheese was good tho. happy hour is a gimmick cuz the drinks were just diluted..
4
Went for weekday dinner.. enjoyed our time with good food and attentive services. Would highly recommend this restaurant!

Having lived in the US for 4 years then I got to eat in a mix of steak and burger restaurants which in the whole were good.Chop house I was told was good for burgers and steaks but I wanted lunch so opted for the former. Overall the burger was average - well cooked but a little bland despite the large amount of BBQ sauce lashed on it. Felt like the latter was an attempt to cover up the former. Two other things disappointed me -1)In a restaurant that serves meat to have only Dijon mustard is criminal. 2)The service was a intermittent - it seemed at one point it was more important to take a phone call than serve me. Whilst I know I am not the centre or attention they could have responded more effectively and quicker. They were however very quick to clear the table. I came with high expectations and was left very underwhelmed. For $30 ++ for a burger I believe there are probably better options.

brought my family of 4 for dinner on 27/1, spend SGD 197 for 3 sides and 4 mains, no soft drink, beer, wine nor dessert. steak served was a little small, under char, quite cold, overall the portion is small. the truffle fries cost me $8 for just like Mcdonald medium size fries, especially would like to highlight one of the side dish "pork belly", it cost me SGD 18 for 3 little bun wrap with less than an inch thick of port meat", I measured the dimension was 2" by 1.5" size.worst is the billing was kind of cheating to me. I have purchased a SGD 50 worth of chope voucher, not sure how they use the voucher? I thought the voucher amount should be deducted from my bill first. my bill is nett 168,after the gst and 7% service, the total is $197.8. the restaurant deducted the $50 from the total amount. I thought it suppose to deduct the $50 from the $168 first (this was the amount of all the food I ordered) than add on the 7% and service charge to the amount $118.Anyway, it was not value for money, I wont go back again
2
We paid $106 for 2 steaks, 1 side and 1 dessert. Price wise may seem reasonable on the first glance but the steaks were really small and of laughable quality. The steaks were so chewy and hard that we had a really difficult time trying to finish off our meat. Safe to say I would never return.

The name of the restaurant caught my eye when I was looking for a place to celebrate my husband's birthday and the kids want have some "meat" for some reasons. The photos on the restaurant's webpage also looks tempting. And it didn't disappoint - the crispy salmon I had was done just right. The birthday "boy" shared his BBQ back ribs with my 2nd son and they both enjoyed it... the meat was tender and slips out from the bone easily. My eldest like his grass fed tenderloin medium rare and he likes it very much. The rest had pasta and fish & chips. On the whole, everyone enjoyed their meals. However, I understand the restaurant is under the Australian Wooloomooloo group, so I would expect the food servings will be like the Aussie style - big... but to my surprise, the sirloin steak was smaller than expected. Even the baby back ribs' portion which was to be shared, it may not be enough if the 2 person sharing are big meat eaters :) Service-wise, probably they are shorthanded that evening and we were seated outdoor so we didn't managed to get their attention half the time. But the staff were friendly and helpful - would say above average actually

Nicely located after shopping at the mall.
Sat outside by the sea front with harbour view over looking Sentosa and cable cars.
Prices for Happy hour was reasonable.
Two large beers for $18 plus tax and service charge.
4
The meats at this place is very good and surprisingly so is the pasta.
Beware of the happy hours and drinks promotion - one can be tempted to keep ordering and before you know it, the bill adds up.
Staff are friendly and approachable.
3
Lunch set is around 20. no dessert (but they haven't updated their menu); main course is normal. it's not impressive but still acceptable. the good thing is that the restaurant is quiet.
4
Good ambience with friendly accommodating stuff. Decent steaks at reasonable price. Good ambience and on the outdoor porch for a relaxing meal.
4
Proper restaurant with focus on meat.
Great service. Good view. The steaks are very good. Good happy hour deal
2
ordered bbc burger, fish and chips and mushroom and toast. Burger bun was dry, also meat patty was also dry and lack flavour. Fish and Chips were below average, fish was dry. Only good item was the mushroom and toast
4
Succulent beef served in a nice-looking restaurant. It was a pity service was too slow in a moderately crowded restaurant.
3
Have been visiting monthly for a while, the grill platter was the worst I have had ordered medium rare for both lamb and beef. Beef was charred outside and chewy, lamb was under flavoured. On the bright side, bottle of wine was great as always, staff were friendly atmosphere was great for hanging out.
5
Busy and likeable restaurant at Vivo city mall / Vivo waterfront Promenade. Whilst there is a little too much subued lighting (it was almost dark), and the heavy rock could do with being a notch lower. On the other hand the service and the food were particularly good. A nice place for a splurge, and the steaks are just as you would expect - just perfect
5
Chop house has been our regular burger & beer joint for over an year now as we live very closeby. We invited some friends over to join us for a christmas dinner and all our friends were impressed by the warmth & recognition shown by the crew. They made us look very important as everyone on the team dropped by to say hello and wish us merry christmas! Food was good as well. We tried the roasted quail and lobster mac & cheese from their specials which were yummy.It was one of the best christmas dinners we have had, it was a dinner with friends served and pampered by friends at Chop House. Thank you so much and wish you all a lovely merry christmas
4
Nice place, excellent crew. EPL is shown. Good beer too. Food - my friends liked Steak. I went for vegetarian pasta. What impresses most is their desserts:damn good - my fav is Coconut Brioche
5
The rib-eye steak and truffle fries were tasty. The steak was juicy and tender, and the fries had the right texture when chewed.
5
Had steak and beer for dinner. Nice place to chill and relax. The staff there were friendly and sincere .
4
We came knowing that it was sister outlet of Wooloomooloo, and like the food there. For here, Food was average, 3/5, but reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere to hang out with friends.
5
We had dinner last Saturday night. We arrived their without a reservation and the accommodated 4 of us straight away. We all had entree, main and desert, all was delicious and the service was great. Would go again.
3
My first visit in November was impressive. Set menu courses were freshly served and cooked to a good standard. It was from this experience that I decided to recommend this place for our team Christmas lunch. However, the main dishes served this time were not up to standard. The sirloin steak, pork chop and fish were all over-cooked to a point that made the meat texture very rough and burnt. We got there around 12.30pm and the place was packed with lunch goers, but that doesn’t justify the food inconsistency. I hope the next experience will be a better one
5
I made a reservation online with them for my partners’ birthday dinner and requested for my courses to be pre-ordered beforehand as well as a surprise birthday candle after dinner. Store managers were extremely prompt in acceding to my requests and replying my email. Email exchange was clear, concise and fuss-free.During dinner service we were served attentively and the food came on a consistent and timely basis. Prime Ribeye Steak was yummy and the brownies were the densest ones I’ve ever had(HIGHLY RECOMMEND) (Other food: Beef goulash, spinach and mushrooms)Thank you for the great service! I will not hesitate to recommend you to my other peers in the future
3
The food is decent, nothing spectacular about the offerings. They charge you for table water, which I find absurd. They seem to specialise in burgers, and I had the chicken bacon guac burger. The bun was of good quality, the marriage of the flavours was not bad but the food was a tad salty for my liking. The barramundi fish was too small in portion for the price. The standard has certainly dropped frok my last visit since a good while back. This place seems like a great place for a gathering of friends if you enjoy alcohol though!
4
If Steak is your deal, The Chop House is the place to go. I found out about The Chop House from The Smart Local's review and was dying for some good steak. I shared a Meat Platter with my friend and the steak did not disappoint as it practically melted in my mouth. The lamb on the other hand was a little too fatty for my liking as the fat was not chewable and I gave up on those portions. The portion was too small to be shared by two to be honest. The meat was accompanied by vegetables but I wished that there was Carbs included like French Fries. I will be having Steak only on my next visit.
4
I’d booked a table for 5 for dinner and for some unknown reason, a table only suitable for 4 was reserved for us instead. Thankfully, the manager resolved the issue with no fuss and that set the tone for an unexpectedly great meal and overall experience. The food was great especially the main courses - the pork chop (yums!) & steaks in particular. There’s no denying what a great manager can do to the overall running of a restaurant. Well done The Chop House
3
Atmosphere of the restaurant is good, however not a place to go if you're rushing for time. Service staff are few and inattentive enough, had to wave for service for a while.
4
Arrived early to grab a seat outside. What better way to spend an evening with Mrs over a nice cool beer and food.
The chops were nice, however the sauce was an overkill.
5
Came here to celebrate friend's birthday party. Service was good and meal was very nice!! We were all very satisfied!
4
This is my 2nd time back in the restaurant. Food was good although I feel abit of pricey. Place was not very rowdy so we are able to talk to each other comfortably. It is a good place for group gathering.
5
My favourite steak place! Craving for the food on a regular basis. Even celebrated my birthday there. Nicely done n the service is awesome!
5
Food and ambience are great. They offer set meal at reasonable pricing. They show soccer too. Luckily is not too noisy at the time of visit.
4
We went to The Chop House to celebrate Hubby birthday dinner. Ordered the Burrata & crispy capamary for starters. Our mains was the ribeye steak. Good food.
Thanks!
4
The Chop House is located overlooking Sentosa and the view is good. We sat outside and its quite active during the evening. The Paulaner beer was on promotion $8 a pint, wow its great. The Oktoberfest platter $82 was more then enough for 4. The staff was great, polite, helpful and always ready to help. Keep up guys
5
My Husband and I were duly satisfied with the mixed grill we ordered and the steak came exactly how we requested it (medium rare). The staff were also very polite and patient and when they realised my child was sharing the platter too, he offered to ask the Chef to cook a slice of the beef a little more if we needed, in case it was too rare. That was very awesome of them
4
Service was great except that they seem a bit understaffed on a holiday eve. Hence, sometimes we are unable to seek attention of any staff as they have to run both indoors and outdoors.The Dinner Set Menu indicates that it is available from Sunday - Thursday. However, even though we went on a Thursday, it is not applicable for eve of Public Holiday. We were quite disappointed especially since the menu was advertised on the table and did not indicate any such caveat.We ordered the following items:- Half dozen oysters: Fresh and good. I generally usually only eat 1 or maximum 2 oysters due to the taste but these oysters were so fresh that I enjoyed it and had my full share of 3 (half-half with my partner)- Australian Sirloin: The sirloin had a nice grill taste but it was a bit too salty. Serving was just nice and the doneness was just nice as well. (I ordered medium)- USDA Prime Rib Eye: This was really good. Taste, serving and doneness (my partner ordered medium rare) was all just nice. The meat was very juicy and totally worth it. Made the sirloin pale greatly in comparison.We also ordered 1 glass of white wine, 1 glass of perseco and 1 glass of Lager. Our total cost amounted to $150. Only the sirloin didn't seem quite worth the price, but it could be because we had the rib eye to compare against
4
Had a 3-course set dinner at the chope house. Food was good! Quiet place to catch up wif friends after work on a weekday
4
If you like lamb and spices, don't miss out on the lamb sausage that's on both the bar bites menu and the mix grilled platter. So good. And happy hour last till 11pm!
4
Nice food and reasonably priced set lunch. Gula melaka ice cream dessert is nice. Nice ambience for group gathering
5
Awesome food , nice ambiance and polite staffs.
First time there and we had the recommendations by the staff, the Grain Fed Beef is super awesome!
5
We've come often to celebrate birthdays. Love the vibe (the music is always great), the ambience is wonderful and the food and service is great. We've always found the team working there friendly and accommodating.
5
The waiters and waitresses were attentive despite us requesting to be seated outdoors. The place was not filled with noisy conversations or loud laughter. The quality of the food has always been excellent over the past years. In overall, I would recommend couples to give this place a try, especially on a weekend night
5
We always have drinks and some small bites. Love the happy hour, 2 large beers for $16! wah!It is our drinking joint after work. service staff are all very good. They know you if you go often and always service you with smile. We never had dinner there but we the nachos and the calamari on their bar food menu is very nice with the beers. Only small issue I have is that the music is sometimes loud. But my friends love it so I hope they reduce it just a little bit so we can chat. Anyways I love chop house and your happy hours
5
Chanced upon this restaurant after a day at Sentosa with the family. They were doing 2 pints of beers at 16 bucks from 3-7pm. We went in just for drinks hoping we had time for downing a couple before heading back to the hotel. It was pretty good crowd for a tuesday evening, mostly after work folks catching the happy hour deal. Ended up having dinner after drooling over the yummy looking burgers. We had the Aussie & the BBC burger, one of the best I ever had. seriously seriously good! Kids enjoyed the fish & chips and the spaghetti carbonara too. All in all very good meal for the price you pay.Service is very good as well. Kids meal included juices or soft drinks but they gladly switched it for a glass of warm milk. Friendly staff who will chat you up and very polite and accommodating with all requests
3
Been here for dinner before and it was a world of difference.Brought a client to lunch and was rather disappointed, they got our appetiser wrong. Then the cushion seat was probably wiped and dried properly, it left a horrible damp smell on my colleagues skirt
3
Slightly above average food, would have prefer that the USDA Prime Rib Eye melts in my mouth but it didn't, and the water cress was still wet from its wash so I couldn't taste the dressing. Burrata was too curd like, wasn't creamy and smooth enough. Wanted to try mussels mariniere but they were out of it, so opted for mushrooms garlic toast, like the taste of the mushrooms.
4
We enjoyed the food and service! Food was reasonably priced and the staff there was attentive. Will visit again.
5
The food is good and reasonably priced. The place is also good to organise small events with a special corner and the service during my visit was outstanding from a particular server.
5
The staff were very very hospitable and very nice. The food was amazing. Would definitely come again. My Boyfriend and I definitely enjoyed our time.
5
The Chop House at VivoCity is a great place to dine. My husband & I dine there every week and we're never short of choices. The set lunch menu is value for money & has an extensive range from salads to the best USDA Prime grain-fed ribeye
2
Service was extremely slow, we ordered salad, fries, steak and a burger. None of our food came for over 30 mins. I tried to catch a waiters attention, who acknowledged but never came to the table. The other tables that came later were being served first and I was disappointed as we were looking forward to eating here for a while. Food was good, but the service brought the whole experience down
4
Been here before with several friends. A little pricey on ala carte but tonight, we decided to check out their set meals. I must admit it was good value for money. I ordered the calamari as starters. It was acceptable. Unfortunately, the steak was supposedly medium served to me as opposed to me using for medium rare. I opted not to return since it was a busy night n things like this does occurred on a busy night. I hope to return again to be served a good steak.High lights for the night was the Gula mela ice cream. It was awesome.
4
booked a table for our anniversary on a weekday night, and asked to be seated outside facing sentosa. view was pretty good with occasional breeze. Spotlight can be a little warm but overall still ok.wanted to try the lamb bone marrow but unfortunately its out of the menu long ago. had their set dinner instead at 38++ with a good selection of mains. their happy hour was very affordable too.food quality was good, overall it was good except that the service can get a little slo
5
I've been wanting to try the burgers here for ages and even though I've been building up expectations in my head for almost a year the reality still managed to knock it out of the park. Comes with a generous serving of fries, too, which is rare for semi-expensive places like these. Service was practically fine-dining standard. Great beer selection. Loved it. All my friends loved it. 12/10 would come again tomorrow
4
My 2nd time visiting this place. The highlight of the meal was probably the USDA Prime Rib Eye and the Mussel Soup. The meat was excellent and the cook was on point. The lamb chop was unfortunately not up to par. I ordered the lamb medium but the cook on the 2 racks were inconsistent. One was slightly towards medium rare and one was slightly towards rare.Overall, a good place to hangout on Friday night and have some decent steak. Would recommend this place to everyone.Must tries: Mussel soup, Berkshire Pork Chop, USDA Prime Rib Eye
1
The food was sub-par for the amount we paid. The food took a while to come. The fries when it came, was lukewarm so we had to request for a change of the fries. I think it was probably just retried. The fish that my friend ordered wasn't very fresh and she had to change her order to a burger which was unfortunately bad as well. The steak was average and the red wine sauce was diluted. The pork that was ordered by another friend was passable and it just tasted like English char siew. All in all, it wasn't a value for money meal. The only saving grace was perhaps the service of the server who was friendly and patient
5
This place lives up to the wooloomooloo name! We had a tenderloin and a ribeye and both were perfectly cooked. The Mac and cheese and creamed spinach were delicious. Service was friendly and efficient. We'll be back soon for the burgers that everyone's raving about!
4
Overall pretty good food, but my order of beef fajitas had too little beef slices. They provided 4 tortilla wraps, but the beef slices were not sufficient for 4 decent tortilla wraps.
4
The restaurant serves nice food and beer. The atmosphere is quite nice and you should try to select a table with a good view of Sentosa. As for food, you should try their pork and beef selection.
5
The restaurant is not noisy on weekdays and is highly recommended for gatherings and couple dates. However, the price may be more expensive than usual restaurants.
5
i've been here several times, and the food never fails to disappoint.
we especially love the nachos and the wings. the burgers are also consistently good! a pity they took the mini beef wellingtons off the menu
4
It was our 2nd visit there and we enjoyed our dinner experience both times. Service was great and the one of the waiters was really attentive to us. Food was tasty too.
4
The meal was wonderful. Good food as we ordered the meat platter. We loved the sausages but it was too much for us. The pork kunckle seemed decent but quite hard to cut so had to send back to the kitchen. The kids had their fish and chips and mac and cheese which was awesome. My daughter enjoyes the calamaries and the churros. Service was good and the staff was attentive.
3
We ordered 1. crispy pork belly appetiser - it was only normal fried bacon in 3 pieces of Chinese steam bun loaded with mayonnaise for $18, nothing better than hawker food.2. Burrata appetiser - mozzarella came in big ball that dominated the small plate, it was freeze burned, totally tasteless. The slices of tomatoes were skimpy and the drizzle of pesto sauce was laughable. We topped $7 for ham but it came in pathetically thin sheets, with 3 slices around the plate. 3. Baby back ribs - the meat was well marinated and came off the bone cleanly, as expected of baby back ribs. It has a nice fresh herb fragrance. However, it was a little dry.4. Tenderloin - ordered medium rare, but was too rare the first time. It was merely seared on the surface. The second time round was much better. 5. Crispy salmon - it was decent, salmon was creamy and its skin was indeed crispy. The manager was accommodative. At least it made us felt better.
4
My kid has been to this place before and she recommended that I try out this restaurant. It's very relaxing for us refer to this place as Chop Chop instead of saying Chop House. Ok now about food. We love the Burrata served with tomatoes and basil pesto. But we loved it better with Parma Ham added and requested for it to be added. Price of $18 plus $5 is very reasonable compared to elsewhere. We also ordered the Quesadillas Chicken and the full slab of smoked BBQ US Baby Back Ribs with coleslaw. The ribs are for 2 persons but for small eaters like us (3 females), it's an awesome big portion! Its meat is really so tender that it just came off the bone and the sauce was so delicious. It reminded us of the St Louis pork ribs from Cafe Cartel that we used to love so much but has since closed. The Quesadillas Chicken is not fantastic tough as I have tasted better elsewhere. It's too dry and not tasty enough. No oomph! Service here is very prompt and the waiters are so friendly that it made dining here extra enticing not to mention the relaxing atmosphere and the ability to look out into the sea if you are seated right inside and next to the glass panel. I would definitely come back and try out other dishe
4
A good place to take abreak from your shopping and enjoy the simpler things of life...at a price. Sit outside and choose from a menu that offers steaks, pork chops and Salmon. I did the pork chops, which I loved, and tasted Salmon and the steak ( greedy) and all met my exacting standards. So did the view.
4
Good ambience, very consistent food quality and service. I am a frequent patron here. Just had the baby back ribs, best I've had in Singapore.
3
Food
Taste OK only and the food portion is too small
Ambiance
Great place to enjoy beer
Service
Not bad
It feels like it's such a rip on the price versus the portion of food they serve. Too bad!
5
Service is exceptional and the food was good. With the exception of desserts being average, their mains were pretty outstanding despite a bit of initial hiccups.
4
Went to chop house to celebrate a birthday. Must say that the service and food is top notch. Portion size is reasonable but for big eaters might seem quite little. Steak was done to perfection.
4
The burger was not bad. Beef nicely cooked and the caramelized onions added a nice balance to the meat. The gula melaka dessert could do with a bit more gula melaka.
2
When you feel you can do better at home, sadly you know you wasted your time.One thing Chop House does well is burgers and steaks. Pity the former was not available and pity I didn't want the latter.Beef quesadillas were soggy and average but tasted ok. Burrata and tomatoes were again average and underseasoned. I have definitely made better at home for less.Fish and chips looked good. Can vouch for the fish being fairly good.Beef fajita on the other hand was disgusting. Steak burnt to oblivion and chewy as hell. Fajita sauce was simply revolting to the extent I had to stop eating half way through. Badly executed dish from start to finish.Service was slow and perfunctory.At almost S$150 for this, two glasses of wine and two soft drinks...an utter waste of money
4
went here alone by night for some meat, I had the lamb chops, a beer, a wine and the cheescake. The food quality was very good, drinks also.Only bad thing is the price, I had to pay ~90 $, which might be normal for Singapore in a fancy place, but for a europan guy it takes some time to get used too that :).Location is good, I would recommend to come while there is still some sun.anyway, I would recommend this place and might go again next week
4
Dine to a short burst of firework across the sea at Sentosa at 8.30pm every night!About 4-5 seconds to be precise. We find it amusing, but it was rather lovely.We were seated outside, wait staff was friendly and attentive, tables were adequately spaced out. Food was simple on the layout, but tasty. The missus rarely finished everything in her plate even when she was famished. Didn't have to ask why.My date was late today. Had to tell 3 different wait staff that came to my table to retrieve the menu to leave it there. My bad. But to the boss of the house, seems like you have a shortage of menu for such a big place. Perhaps you should consider printing more....Will return, definitely, for other than the short boo-boo with the menu earlier, we were basically enjoying our moments there, with the waitors coming over at the right time to serve our food and drinks and attentively telling us to signal to him when we need our coffee. Thoughtful and attentive. Nice
2
Nothing much on the food to shout bout, each of us had a set dinner. Couldn't pinpoint if it was value for money or not, the 3 courses were mussel soup (a creamy thingie, like common soup with mussel pieces halved) steak plus bailey cheesecake (the base was too crumbly and fine), and other was fried calamari (frozen rings so uniformly cut by machine) pork chop with 3 relishes and apple strudel.Once again, f&b in Singapore is SO DEAD cuz the soup was brought on, and no staff ever laid a spoon for the diner. Go figure out if this is acceptable and why did you have to pay service charge.
5
We were looking for an alternative to eat as our first choice restaurant was full. We passed The Chop House, checked the menu and went in. Choice of inside/outside tables, we went outside as the view is great from the place. There were plenty of fans to keep it bearable. Whereas the service is a tat slow, the quality of the food is outstanding. We ordered the mixed grill for two and a few sides. Meat was perfectly cooked and juicy and the sides were good too. The place is great to have a good time with friends as well. Th drinks are nice and cold, the menu offers plenty of snack choice and there is plenty of space for larger groups.Its not cheap but prices are fair for the quality and ambience
5
Overall, the dining experience at the restaurant is good with friendly service crew and appealing photo-taking food.
5
good service. steak was done to our liking, though the mac&cheese side was a disappointment. nevertheless, the staff were all helpful.
5
We were there for lunch last sat. The service was very good with friendly staff. Food and ambiance were good too.
5
Service staff went beyond the call of duty to make us feel comfortable. My phone was charged as we ate. The food, especially the pork chop was marvellous. We all cleaned our plates. Definitely a must try.
4
We enjoyed our dinner at the chop house on a Sunday evening. Although the restaurant was busy the service was excellent and cheerful. The food certainly was TOP notch and the portions large making it great value. I had a number of starters including the filet Mignon salad and corn soup. Cooked beautifully and delicious. My family had carbonara and another the salmon which were tasty. Nothing to fault
5
We were recommended the steaks at the Chop House. When we arrived the staff were prompt and very friendly. Service was quick and food came out decently fast despite it being a friday evening. The steaks were cooked to perfection and because of the set meal, we were fed until our bellies burst. Awesome food and awesome value.
4
The place is clean, and it's good for big groups. Food is good too. And I also left a note that it was a birthday celebration, the staff remembered and prepared candles and song for the cakes. However, I hope my medium rare steak can be less done though.
2
Food weren't tasty (had the pasta, prawns, chicken, steak and quesidilla). Only the appetisers were alright but even the fries was of such small portion. Expensive as well. Mehh. Besides the food, the service was REALLy great THO
5
The restaurant has a relaxing ambience. We were served by warm and friendly staff who was also patient with our orders. Certainly a place to go on weekends after a hectic working week
5
Cant go wrong here. Good food at good prices. Well worth having a bite to eat here and the service is fantastic. Make a reservation should you wish to sit insid
4
Food was nice. Ordered chicken fajitas but not many pieces of chicken though. Service staffs were friendly and efficien
5
My partner and I had dinner at The Chop House in Vivo City. The selection for set menu was fantastic. Soup and calamari to start, a steak and porkchop as mains, and brownie and apple streudel for dessert. These foods made our night. The service was also brilliant. Thanks and we'll surely be back
4
Atmosphere was good. But the food can be better as I expected more. The staff are nice. Might go back again.
3
Visited this place during lunch time. Reservation is made via chope reservations but wasn't in records of the resturant. Thank god we got a seat! We ordered the fried calamari to share. The calamari is sliced too thinly and it's hard and dry. I won't recommend the dish. The main dishes of steak, salmon are all great. They are tasty and steady is nicely cooked. And the mustard sauce served is very tasty. Brownie and ice cream came as part of the dessert with the lunch set. Ice cream is too sweet and the brownie is too crumbled and powdery. The service is good, however food serving is very slow. Overall, it's a pleasant experience with good ambience, good quality servicing, good quality main courses and reasonable pricing. Looking forward to an improved speed on serving food and better calamari & dessert.
4
My son love the steak so much that even valentine's day he date with me at chop for the best steaks in singapore.
4
didn't expect much from a steakhouse within a mall but it was surprisingly decent (i had the tenderloin). the desserts aren't their strength though so would recommend going somewhere else after for second
5
Accommodating to reasonable requests, attentive to customer's needs. Suitable for family with young children.
4
The food was really good, decent portion. We went as a family of 4 adults & 2 children. Ordered 6 mains, 4 sides, some beers plus 3 sets of kids menu! The quality of the meats were so good we ordered more to share! Highly recommend the USDA prime Rib Eye, AUS Lamb chops and French fries (we ordered 2 portions)! Pork Chop and Garlic prawns were good too! Will definitely go back again
3
Steak is OK, the product is not so bad,not high quality, the meat is not "fondant", lack of flavor, but still an average beef, a steak restaurant among many, nothing special
5
Loved my first lunch experience at The Chop House.I tried their 2 course set menu: mixed green salad and Australian sirloin, paired with a glass of Marius red wine.Salad was not bad, with romaine lettuce, cucumber, black olives, cherry tomatoes in balsamic dressing. Good appetizer. The sirloin steak came with sautÃ©ed veggies and mashed potatoes (fantastic creamy texture). Soft and juicy steak. The black peppercorn sauce provided a nice kick with its spicy flavor, together with the chili mustard. Very good meal !Will be back for sure.

Had dinner with my wife on Xmas eve. Staffs were friendly and patient, food wise the Ribeye steak was done right and the crispy Salmon fresh and juicy, the desserts need more work to make it right thought. Overall great dining experience, good value steaks
4
Scenery is nice and food taste different from other restaurant. I will come back and eat 1 more time with my family members
3
Very busy staff a little unorganized, mains came out before entree but manager was very apologetic and endeavored to put everything right. Food averag
4
Had very fulfilling dinners here and expected equally heavy lunch but to my surprise, the lunch menu is just nice for a quick lunch with a sea view in tow. Extend the options to the dinner menu to make it an attractive all day dining place for the not so heavy eaters.
4
The service staff we very attentive to us. However, the only slight disappointment was: we booked for a table of 6 adults. They gave us a 2 small tables merged into 1
4
Tried the U.S baby pork ribs. Tenderly juicy good. Nice Ambience, located at Vivo city. Service good.
5
Very caring and compassionate staff who went out of the way to take care of its customers. Excellent service oriented without any reservations
4
I thought that the food served was really good. We've tried the Chicken Burger and the breast patty was exceptionally juicy (which was a real surprise for us)! The Sirloin's medium rare request was also spot on!Although we could have used a little more attention from the service staff, I thought that they were very polite and helpful when they finally attended to us
3
While waiting for us to choose our food, i saw the waitress give the attitude look when she was waiting. When she spotted i was looking , she immediately switch her expression back. The food was so so, especially the spring chicken which was close to meatless
3
Ordered a few appetizers, steaks and desserts there. The food were good. However, the items are all pricey and may not be worth the cost. Service was good. While there were a few glitches in the orders, they were professional in compensating the gaps and courteous to accept them. Would be back only for the good service
5
excellant food good service what else can one say but am being told i need at least one hundred letters, try the pork knuckle for 2
4
Enviroment was nice, food was good and affordable. Most importantly staff was very friendly and helpful.
4
My family and I was there for lunch on a Sunday. The foods and service was good. Mash potato was one of the best sides.
5
Arrived ahead of our reservation and were promptly seated. Wait staff service was attentive, and set a good tone for the rest of our dining experience. Food quality was excellent, and I especially love the Garlic Toast with Mushrooms :)
4
Great service for a Sunday Lunch with the family. It helps if you book after the peak period so there is no rush in getting orders made and you can chill at the restaurant for awhile before leaving.

Chop House has become one of my Favourite burger joints in Singapore. A couple things they do well. The get a really nice, flavourful crust in the meat. The bun has enough substance to stand up to a juicy burger and not fall apart. In your hands. And the chips are usually a perfect golden brown and not oily. The beer selection is small, but a couple good ones are on the list. Finding a good burger in SG is difficult. It really is. And local recommendations usually disappoint me, having grown up eating corn fed American beef and later Argentine beef. So if your tastes run in the same direction, you might like Chop House.
4
This was my 5th time eating @ the chop house. Good ambience. It gets a little too dim at night. If u prefer having food under brighter lighting, go there earlier. Great food. Love the steak & the mushroom soup. I think they have changed the menu & I prefer the older version. Tried wooloomooloo but still prefer the chop house. Will visit again
5
I absolutely love this place! Its a must visit food stop if you are in Singapore. Baby octopus salad is to die for. Excellent selection of wine with the finest dining. Jack and his entire staffs are very friendly and professional! 5 starts for their excellent service :
5
Visited their new Katong outlet to celebrate my mom's birthday and it was a pretty damn good night out. Their mushroom garlic toast and the coconut brioche toast were super yummy! We also had the calamari, garlic prawns, sirloin and tenderloin which did not disappoint for their quality. Service was wonderful (the staff were Singaporeans which proved that we can achieve a high service standard!). Can't wait to go back and try something different there, esp with the cool vibes from their decor.
5
This is a nice spot for lunch if you're working in the area. Quality of food is good, food comes in a jiffy and service is more than decent. Set lunches comes with an appetizer of nachos or salad for free, so basically you only pay for the price of your mains and they have more than 10 main course options to choose from. If you have room for dessert, the add on option is available. They also have delicious home made onion jam, sambal and mustard on the table to spice up your meal
3
Food portion was sizeable. The pumpkin soup was good but beef was a bit tough, even though it is done medium. Set lunch is good value.
4
We have lunch there alternate Sundays. They serve good American-style food with a fresh twist. Burgers are nice, as are the salads. Their cocktails are equally nice, in particular the mojitos. Service is prompt and very friendly.
4
The food was delicious. We ordered New Zealand Sirloin and Fish and Chips for main, and Banger & Mash to share. The ingredients were fresh.
The staffs were friendly and helpful too.
4
Had the two course lunch set, the nachos and the pork chop~
Food was delicious, maybe a little heavy handed with the barbecue sauce over the pork chop but otherwise it was a good dish. Meat was tender and moist.
4
Ambience was friendly for a cosy friend or family gathering, wouldn't say it is a date night place as the crowd are more common. Good was good and slightly worthy of money. Homemade sauces selection was a great option.
5
A great place to enjoy nice dinner with the family. Loved the attentive service and beautiful environment.
4
The thing I love about Chop House is really, their chilled vibe. The location is great, the steak is good and damn, that onion jam! Best of all, it's not ridiculously expensive, which makes for a nice casual night out.
4
We've arrived here after searching for a decent place to eat steaks on our budget. It was a good decision. We took the fillet and rib eye both served in right medium. They were delicious and in the price of 30-40$ per dish. On the other hand, we tried there also a burger and it was low quality for our taste. They changed it to a steak with no hesitations so we give them credit for the service. Some other dishes were not as good quality as well, such as the chips - which are not home made and not from reall fresh potatoes and also the mash potatoes felt like fast food with some flavor powder they added inside. The atmosphere is great, near the water. To conclude : If you want nice steaks near the water half the prices of steak houses in the marina area - go for it!

Went for dinner with my friends at The Chop house and ordered Grassfed Temderloin. As the restaurant was pretty busy that night, the steak that was served to me was totally not up to standard. I ordered medium rare and what came was almost medium. I feedback to the waiter and asked why is my steak like that and Chop House is suppose to be under the same group as The Wooloomooloo steakhouse. His answer to me was "Wooloomooloo is Wooloomooloo, it's different and medium rare is like that one", he did not even offer to change the steak for me. I was very disappointed in their service that night and the food they served. I was there years before and I remembered that their steak was quite good but standard drop drastically is that is really how their steak are. It's totally not worth the money at all!
4
A little long to wait for drinks though it was not too busy on a Wed night. Nonetheless, mixed grill did the job! :) Happy with the serving! Desert was a little disappointing though as we can't taste the slightest tinge of baileys in the cheesecake :( Brownie was nice & moist though... Hope they can improve on the dessert
4
Food are generally quite nice especially the meat such as burgers and steak. Fish and chip are not too nice though the salmon is goood. The food are on a heavier taste side, more saltish and flavourful.
5
Overall the food is good though portion a bit small. Recommended for gathering. The beer is good and relatively cheap.
5
Lovely casual dining by the water. Grandsons love their hamburgers and so did I. Very enjoyable place to dine - good food and good service.
3
We were there celebrating our friend's birthday. The ambience was average and seats were not so comfy. They served a bottle of chilled water but only 2 glasses were given despite we reserved for 7 pax. As our friend each arrived, we have to keep asking for glasses. Even ordering drinks will take a while for the waitress to come and take orders. The restaurant were less than half filled but service still slow and as for the food wise, it's just average. Steak, prawns and squid were done nicely. But the lamb chop, salad, sausages, clam and salmon were average. Not a meal that you will yearn to have again. Also not really a place you want to sing birthday song and celebrate cause the Waiters and Waitresses just won't bother so much. Everything just simply average.
4
Nice ambience overseeing Sentosa Island. Tried the Chicken Burgers and Ribs previously and it was good. So this time I tried fish and chips which a tad small I.e. not enough. The beef burgers are unique but the steak seems a bit tough. Otherwise a great experience although this trip the food experience was neutral
4
This place is our regular weekend haunt. The food is modern American, with grilled meats, burgers, salads, etc. The produces they use are fresh and tasty. Portions are very copious, so much so that we rarely make it to dessert. Service is friendly and efficient. Their burgers are highly recommended, as are the prawns and rice. Don't forget to order a classic mojito to go along with the meal.
5
Shopping at VivoCity and thinking of have a yummy delicious lunch..I saw the restaurant named The Chop House with the logo of big knife, Crispy Pork Belly must be in their menu. Friendly staff greet us with a smiley face, and recommended us (with a young kid) to sit indoor due to hot weather. Highly recommended to those people whom are the meat lovers, pasta also very delicious. Sure will visit again this branch
4
Had a wonderful late lunch here last weekend. The three layer pork was simply delicious. The NZ tenderloin was yummy as well. The brandy cheesecake was simply tasty, not too sweet and not too alcoholic. The waiter accidentally broke the sauce jar at the next table but he apologised to all the customers there who saw it. Overall was a great experience.

I had visited the restaurant at Katong I12 on 13 January 2016 at about 3pm.We had the usual fare of salads, soups, burgers and I was particular attracted to the Australian gain fed steak on the menu.The waitress who served us was nice and polite.I had asked for my steak to be done medium rare.When the steak came, it was over cooked and was well done. The manager had it changed. Half an hour later, the steak came. This time, it turned out medium well.The manager (an Indian chap) did not apologise but instead offered to change the steak again.I could not wait as we were catching a movie. I had to force myself to finish the steak which turned out horrible! It was dry, charred and tasteless!!Later, a lady manager who was at the entrance of the restaurant canvassing for customers, asked if everything was all right as we were leaving. I told her my bad experience and left a contact number when she said she will investigate the incident and get back to me. It has been half a year already. I am not asking for a free meal. I just want an explanation for the incident.The chef is a caucasian guy, presumably Australian, judging from his accent.The chef or cook does not know how to cook a good steak medium rare, which is the easiest way to cook a steak. Apparently, they had barbecued the ribeye on low heat, did not seal the steak and let all the moisture out, making the steak overcooked, dry and tough.I will never step into this restaurant ever again!! And I will not recommend that you do.It really sucks!
5
I have been here a few times . The food is always good and service is excellent. Had a great waiter called Spike who really is a cut above and helped to make the meal even more enjoyable. Very friendly but with a really great attitude to service Also in the evening it is nice to sit outside and watch dusk falling over Sentosa across the wate
4
We came for the set lunch comprising of starter and main course. We had the beef steak which was decent. Service is prompt and polite. Will return go sure.
4
We ordered the patty melt burger, australian grass fed tenderloin and steamed broccoli. Liked all of them.
I think we were helped by the manager. He was very kind and professional.
Location is in a big shopping mall. Many other café's and restaurants.
4
Went there to have steaks. The steaks were good but priced on the high side without sides. Dessert were also delicious! The service was good, with the staff and manager being attentive to the quality of food served. One of the better-than-best service served here for restaurants
4
Hopefully this review is based on The Chop House opposite Sentosa Island in Vivo City. First of all customer service, excellent. We were served by a very friendly waiter. I had a New Zealand Sirloin, came with a mixture of sauces and cost $29. Fries were extra at $5. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, my partner Di had Crispy Skin Salmon and she rated it as lovely. Some may know Singapore is ridiculously expensive for alcohol but we came here as there was a happy hour on lager, 2 for $20 which equals approx Â£5 each. Plus we are both smokers and were able to be seated at a smoking table, something that is near impossible at home in the UK.The happy hour was due to end at 8pm but our lovely waiter told us it was on offer all night to us.So all in all a very nice restaurant, gorgeous views of Sentosa Island and a lovely atmosphere.8/1
4
Like it that it's a casual environment, with quality food served by warm service staff. Nothing's complicated where menu is concerned and service staff is always available when you needed one. Most importantly, they respond to the request immediately, so all you needed to do is really to focus on the dinner and the fellowship with your family/dining partner(s).Food quality is good too, and portioning adequate. Having said that, the beef goulash was a disappointment as it wasn't done right.Would revisit to try the other food, but really love the casual dining experience there
3
My family of 4 dined at The Chop House for the first time. The food was ok and reasonably priced given the nice ambiance. The manager was very friendly and helpful but some other younger crew members' services could be improved. They are polite but didn't really get our orders right. We requested for 4 glasses of plain water and were only given 2. We requested for another 2 glasses and only received 1 more. We got our last glass of water after our 3rd attempt. My daughter ordered a chocolate ice cream and was given a vanilla ice cream instead. When we told the waiter about the wrong order, he apologized and returned with the same vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. They got the order right after the 3rd time. Nevertheless, we had a good meal
5
I have been to this restaurant several times and I can say that their food is amazing. I usually order steaks. They server very good quality of beef. Their Mussel soup is also very nice. They have a good range of beers, wines and non-alcoholic drinks. The food choices are very good to beef, pork, chicken and seafood
3
Celebrating our anniversary at The Chop House@Vivo and was very looking forward to enjoy the famous Pork chop for the first time. However, it was very disappointing because the meat was so tough and hard, the sauce was sweet and everything just doesn't match. The fries was dry and hard (not crispy). But I got to say beside the Pork Chop, the rest of the food We ordered was alright, the salmon was nice, the calamari was good too. I don't think the price is worth overall, I can get a better taste with good quality pork chop elsewhere with better price but of course no sea view. The staff are not very professional by the way the answer and the way the represent themselves (need to be more neat and tidy). Hope they can improve themselves.

I called in to make a reservation last week. The lady who picked up the phone, Sariah or Sabrina (?), was very friendly and accommodating. As we were celebrating my friend's birthday, we were allocated a table indoors with the view of Sentosa waterfront. Despite the restaurant being very busy last Friday, I was attended to very quickly. We were welcomed with smiles by the service staff. They have recently changed their menu! There are a lot of exciting new items :pThe manager, who introduced himself as Faizal took our orders and gave very good recommendations. For appetiser, we also ordered the fresh oysters, crispy calamari and burrata to share. The oysters were AHH-mazing, super fresh!!! We loved every bit of it, especially the chive vignette. Burrata was creamy and soft, it went very well with the pesto and tomatoes. *TWO THUMBS UP* We love the crispy calamari which was very crispy, definitely a must-order. The manager also came to check on us regularly to ensure everything was alright. We had a mixed grilled platter and U.S. baby back ribs for mains. The steak and lamb cutlet on the mixed grill platter was done to perfection. It was tender, juicy and full of flavour. Our favourite was the US baby back ribs! The meat was very soft and melted in our mouth. I would strongly recommend it! They also have a wide selection of draft beers. We managed to try mac's great white and pure blonde. I love how their beers are served in frozen mugs.. super cold beers! It turned out that their happy hour has been extended to all day!!! BEST NEWS EVER :) We ordered the hot chocolate brownies, tiramisu and baileys cheesecake to share as desserts. I was so happy when the dessert was served as I requested to have a special message written and the birthday surprise was perfectly executed. If you are looking for a place to celebrate birthday, look no further. The food and service was beyond our expectations. We will definitely be back soon!!
4
I had my reservations at first because I've eaten at the original Woolloomooloo Steakhouse in Hong Kong before and generally find exports of good restaurants to other cities usually disappoint. Case in point being Jamie's Italian. The medium-rare steak I ordered was not over-cooked and the steak sandwiched my family member ordered was not overly tough. The mussels in the Mussel Mariniere were fresh and the white wine sauce had the right amount of garlic in it. The calamari was crispy. The desserts aren't too imaginative but the Bailey's Cheesecake had enough Bailey's in it for you to feel a small kick. What you can expect is familiar favourites done well.Although our server initially failed to record our order of Cesar Salad, the manager handled it well when we asked why it hadn't been served. The staff were apologetic without seeming smarmy or disingenuous. We were offered a 10% discount at the end of the meal and this was done automatically without any fuss. I've seen some of the earlier reviews about non-existent service but do not share this view based on my visit to The Chop House yesterday. The staff who served us were cheerful, friendly and my glass of ice water was always kept full.The price point of the food and drink is not cheap by Singaporean standards but you do get what you pay for, in as far as Western cuisine is concerned. It's a decent place to take a girl on a first date or even to have a business lunch
4
Went for dinner earlier this evening with my family. Service was good even when the restaurant was quite busy. Slight delay in food as was understood it was a Sunday and crowded. Great food. Will definitely dine again.
4
Was at Chophouse on Friday and had a really good time! Staff were attentive and prompt even though the place was packed. The manager, Faizal, was friendly and helpful. Will be happy to chill there with friends again!
5
I came to this restaurant with a group friends for early dinner as well as birthday celebration.The manger left us a deep impression with his humour and likeability. The staffs were also friendly and helpful in recommending dishes. Their service was fast and efficient, we didn't wait for long to be served. The price on the other hand was a bit on the expensive side but given the quality of the food, it was worth it. We also ordered a piece of cake with happy birthday written for the birthday girl. The brownie, every bite was filled with the goodness of chocolate, and we would love to have a second piece if calories were non-existent! After dinner, we were quite reluctant to leave the cosy restaurant. Overall, Chop House is definitely a to-go restaurant for catch-up with old friends
4
We were shopping in Vivocity so decided to try this place for lunch. Service was professional and friendly and the food was served very promptly. We shared deep fried calamari as a starter, which was wise as the portion is too much for one person, and followed with NZ grass fed sirloin and a steak and horseradish ciabatta sandwich, both of which were excellent.I don't really see what there is to complain about (reading some of the reviews below), this is a nice steak joint in a pleasant position overlooking the water and we would definitely come back again
4
Missed lunch and decided to have an early dinner to avoid the dinner crowd on a late Tuesday afternoon.The outlet has no break shift and staff on duty were friendly.I love the quality of meat/ steak served. Presentation was enticing enough for me to sink my mouth into every bite of the food. I had the main course and apple pie dessert which paired very well with the cold cold New Zealand beer. Only one choice of fish and chips while there are several varieties of meat dishes from the menu.Prices are fair and outlet has peaceful view of the sea; Star Cruise ship on certain days of the week and boats to Batam if one faces towards the exterior.Prefer off peak dining to enjoy my meal better. From the menu, the set lunch pricing and selection available serms to be money's worth too
1
No one gave us menus; no one came by our table for the first 15 minutes; the beer was the wrong size from what we ordered; the mini-burgers were brought out without cheese; after I sent them back, they brought out the same half-eaten burger with the others, now doused in cheese, together with the same fries now cold. Just unbelievable incompetence, showing a clear lack of leadership and accountability.Food was mediocre at best (dry and tasteless); the imported beer was great
5
Went there on a Friday evening with some expatriate friends from Europe. We had fajitas, steaks, mix grill platter as the main course, with some appetisers, side dishes and deserts. The food quality is good, appetising to the pallet with friendly and efficient service. They have a good range of quality imported beers and variety of cocktails. With clean lines and stylish decor indoors and sea facing outdoor seatings, it creates a warm and cozy ambience in chic style. All in all we had a fabulous experience with awsome food and reasonable price.
2
I took some business colleagues to dinner here. We have been here before and recently was at the flagship restaurant in the city called Wooloomooloo Steakhouse. The service was deplorable. The waitresses did not have a clue as to what they were doing and each order had to be repeated many times. Even then they came back to re confirm the orders. Then it was how long it took for the orders to finally arrive. The steaks were OK. The take home here is if you want good food and service then go to the Wooloomooloo Steakhouse and give the Chophouse the miss. If you have time to spare and want to deal with flirtatious young waitresses then go to the Chophouse
5
Chop House has the best selection of steaks, burgers, beers and cocktails in town. The service staff is just excellent - they are friendly, efficient and always remember how I like my steak grilled. I have had two major Christmas parties at Chop House with over 100 staff. Never fails to please. During their annual anniversary party, the staff arranged a beer pong competition - another hit with locals and newbies. Chop House also has a great outdoor area where you can watch the cruise liners and enjoy waterfront living
5
Came to this restaurant that i've seen before but never been to. Decided to clear my mind off the mid-week stress by dining here and having some pints of beer. Well, i definitely do not regret coming here! Came in to a warm welcome by the staffs and bartender. I decided to have a seat at the bar and a man in blazer approaced me and introduced himself as the manager,Nick? My apologies as i am not so sure of how his name is spelled. He handed me the menu and i was overjoyed as this menu is a meat lovers' dream come true! It was all meat which is what i truly love sooo much! As i was planning to have beer,i decided to have something light to eat in which i ordered tenderloin. For beer,i decided to have a try of Pure Blonde. As usual,the beer arrived first and i took a big gulp of it. It was definitely one of the best and smoothest beer i've ever had at a restaurant! As i was half way down my pint,the tenderloin came and oh dear,it looked great! It was perfectly medium when i cut into it and it was juicy! A great start to my relaxation i thought. The meat was not too chewy and it's texture was just nice. Right amount of chewiness and juiciness. It didn't have any bad stench or texture. I devoured my tenderloin along with the smooth mashed potato and decided to seat outside. Once outside, i had a great view. The water,boats and sentosa! That was all i needed to have a relaxing time. I drank a few more pints,enjoyed my relaxing time with the great view along with the great selection of music and headed home. I thank the staffs for the calm welcoming atmosphere as it was much needed. Will definitely be back here again and not alone
2
at S$120 for two steak meals and 2 drinks the quality of the meal was pretty average. I asked for a starter which came after the main meal was delivered. Staff were not that attentive and we were generally glad to get out of there
5
Loved it! Music Service food View ! Wow!
We Came Sunday for dinner and seré pleasently surprised! The View to Sentosa is nice.. The quality of food is real y Good . Has the tenderloin and sas yummy with pepper flavour. Bier Stella Artois good!
5
Dined at the i12 katong branch. Although it is new the service was great. Food was great too. The manager was also able to recommend what's good. Most of all, service with a smile. I'll be back!
4
Service was really good, good beer, their lamb chop was my favourite! Great appetisers and desert too! Definitely a must go.
5
Awesome chicken and bacon burger. Nice fajitas. Best burger till date in singapore. Finally Vivo has a good place to eat
4
We chanced upon this place as we were walking. The outdoor ambience is really relaxing. Friendly and great service staff. Always ready to help us. Definitely a place to hang out with friends over drinks and snacks.
5
The CHOPHOUSE at vivo makes a great place to relax, kick back and enjoy the surroundings. The location is situated next to the water with a view of Sentosa so I would recommend taking a table outside where you can enjoy the scenery and sea breeze.  The service is fantastic, you are always greeted with a smile and the waiting staff are prompt and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is vibrant and inviting and is both a place you can enjoy in a group setting or as a couple.It was friday night and seems like shorthanded manpower but the staffs were really attentiveand efficient ..( especially the malay guy faisal if I'm not wrong)..and the credit to the entire team.. The quality, value and overall experience of this restaurant definitely does not dissapoint, they have a great selection beers and cocktails. For the menu selection there is a wide variety of dishes to choose from, one of my favorites being the beef steak & the salad... Overall, never fails to disappoint. The ambiance is great for unwinding after a long day at work or for enjoying a leisurely weekend afternoon with friends or family. I will continue to frequent this establishment and enjoy a place which in my opinion ticks all the right boxes and leaves you feeling as a customer that you are not just "another diner" but someone special and worth going the extra mile for. Something which I feel a lot of restaurants in Singapore could learn from
1
Service was slow, hard to get staff's attention who were forever walking around so quickly. Spent 30 mins waiting for my first dish (beef short ribs for 2 which really wasn't sufficient for 2), and had to wait another 45 mins for our 2nd dish (beef bacon burger- beef patty was dry) after several chasing for the food. And what was Classic was while we were into our 2nd dish, the man suddenly served up another beef short ribs (he thought we hadn't receive our first dish!!) within 10 mins of serving our burger
2
Greasy Fajitas and chicken burgers, unfriendly service, inattentive staff, lack of attention to detail i.e. Had to ask for plates and salt and pepper. 3 items sent back during our dinner. Overpriced. Would not recommend. Go next door to Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurant for a better experience.
3
Nice setting next to the quay. Good menu and we enjoyed what we ordered. Maybe could have been hotter! The thing that really let this establishment down was the sloppy service which was a surprise. The service slow which probably contributed to the food not being hot - we probably should have sent it back but we were very hungry by this point! Had to ask for menus a couple of times, had to ask for plates to be cleared, had to ask for table to be wiped etc etc! We also had who we believed to be the restaurant manager spark up his break time cigarette at the table over from us. Probably not the most considerate thing to do within 5 feet of your diners. Take your cigarette break elsewhere. Overall ok if you can put up with the variable service and air of superiority from one or two of the staff. There are probably better establishments so wouldn't recommend
3
Food was slightly above average, but too oily. Service is definitely below average. Takes way too long.
4
Went there for dinner. Love the attention from the staff there. Great food, enjoyed the pasta to the steak. Everything was just good.
Would visit again for sure.
4
Come in evening and have a seat outside. We came in a Friday night for dinner. Beer on the tap happy hours end at 8pm. We had pork chop and ribs. We think the ribs is quite a bit too sweet. Very friendly staff.
5
lovely food.
our food got served within 5mins!
pretty cool and cosy. would have preferred the tables to be further apart. Sitting were too close for comfort with the other guests.
4
One would be hard-pressed to find too much wrong with this place. The menu is simple, and centered around meaty dishes. We've had the Bacon Guacamole & Chicken burger, the Chop House pork burger and the beef Chop House fajitas. All done quite well, with generous portion sizes and served piping hot. The meats were generally tender and juicy. The service is good too, and a meal for two would amount to $60 - $70
1
After placing orders for my steaks and beers, I asked for two glasses of warm water. Only after the fourth reminders, and a little raised voice, which I resisted for the earlier reminders (to the different service crew), that the warm water was served without any apology for the sloppy service.Really spoilt an evening out.
5
Was in this Vivo City mall with my friends for shopping and also we decided to have a dinner in nearby restaurant. Happened to see The Chop House. In the host stand there was a board with meat platter picture. So we decided to give a try.The indoor area was full and it seems to be very clean. Light was deemed. I guess it was there standard dinner light.We decided to sit outside from where we could see a nice night view of sea.Only two staff were outside. One waitress and another I guess manager. Both gave us a warm greetings when we arrived.Asked for the recommendation on beer as we are new in Singapore. He asked me what type of beer u like? Lager beer or wheat beer? He then told us they have 6 types of beers in tap however the best selling beer were Pure blond, Stella, Weihenstephan and Schneider. He recommended us to have a try one one each. It was a nice recommendations.Served in a chilled frozen glasses.We also ordered meat lover platter of $85++, which was a good value of money. The Porton was big for 4 of us. I have to say this is a very good place for hanging out with friends. Service was excellent, food was mouth watering. Overall it's a excellent place.Will come back again whenever I go Singapore.
5
Cool place, easy location and the service is really appreciable. Went there twice with bunch of friends and no complain at all. Awesome view of Sentosa and I had to say good value for money. Its inspiring to see the dedication and professionalism of manager on duty, I really appreciate you man
4
Had a dinner with my friends on Friday. It was very busy friday. We choosed 3 types of beer from the tap which was nice and served very chilled.Ordered mixed grilled platter and seafood platter to share. Took about 30 minutes to come. Eventhough it was really very very busy the service was fantastic. Ice water was topped up whenever our glass was empty. Staffs were very attentive. I can see the two managers were managing restaurant very well. Thanks for the recommendation on beers.Overall we enjoyed throughout dinner. For sure will come back again

It's a cool place for meeting up with friends! Most of us loved the Mac great white beer. I got to say it's the best wheat beer I have ever had in my life. Their seafood and the meat platter is worth every ounce of cholesterol it adds up. It's not some heaped up platter of cheap stuff, you can tell the meats and seafood is of really good quality! I am not surprised as the Wooloomooloo Steakhouse's group chef Glen, who happened to be around that evening keeps a close eye on the food coming out from the kitchen.I am definitely going back whenever it's Beer O'Clock!

Food was good and the location was easy to find.
The service was a little poor but not to bad to the extent where we could not get the attention of the service crew.

My friends and I dined at The Chop House a few days ago and we were impressed with their service and food standard. ..recommend . ..pork burger ..so nice
3
Very average. Staff unattentive. Sat down, 10 seconds later presented a drinks menu and asked what I wanted. Wouldn't wait for me to decide and waiter left never to return.Fajitas - well the accompaniments were the meanest I've ever seen, literally one tea spoon of relish, had to ask for more.It is what it is. Gold Medal winner in the average Olympics.

Visited The Chop House not knowing that it is under the Wooloomooloo group. Chosen it as I was heading into Sentosa for a staycation. It turned out to be a surprise! Had their Happy hour where a full pint goes for $13. Several choice of draft beers included. Took the Ginger and carrot soup (wasn't confident of my choice at first) and it turned out very well. However, my friend who tried it wasn't too impressed due to the sweetness. Their other choice of eggplant was well cooked as well. We all top up the set meal with $10 & opted for the Australian tenderloin. I had medium, and my friends had the medium rare and medium well. All of us were satisfied with our choice. Serving was indeed sufficient. In addition, we had sweet potato fries, calamari, garlic & mushroom toasted bread. Bill came up to $320 for 4 pax. It was well spent thou! Had a great time and the ambience was great. Dessert was fine. Will go back!

Female waitress that took our order isn't professional. After writing down our orders, she returned to repeat our orders again and asked if we confirmed it. For restaurant week, the 3-course set dinner S$45++ is worth it. Had cream of mushroom, yummy. My friends had Parma ham, tomatoes & mozzarella which is standard. Main course rib-eye. I had to send back as the cut was totally too fatty for me. Explained to same female waitress that compared to my other friends' ribeye (picture uploaded), mine was just too fatty and to please provide less fatty new piece. She said ok and came back with the similar looking meat that was obviously quite overcooked (I ordered medium). I told her it's wrong to send me a burnt looking steak and she said cooking it like that will take the fats away. I was shocked! I said I'll explain to the chef but she said she'll get me a new one. Then another waiter brought it back after checking with the chef that it's a new piece. Long story short, I got a so-so rib-eye that was medium raw rather than medium. Overall experience was ruined by this female waitress but the other waiters were alright. I won't ever return and won't recommend, even if it's cheap

4 of us decided on a night at the French chicken shop @ poulet. Upon arrival, near too poulet was a staff trying to lure customers to wine n dine at Chop House. Her name is Aida. She's fun, friendly n very knowledgeable in understanding what the customers want. She offered an all pork platter which was to out delight, a stand out. A mixed grill n all night long happy hour drinks were extended to 4 of us
4
This is one of our favourite places for steaks. The prices are reasonable for the quality you get. sitting outside is really nice, all though it does affect a non smoker like me. The staff and service was great. Unfortunately there were some regulars who had been drinking for hours and behaving loud and obnoxious
4
We ate in this place two weeks ago and last week again. Good quality food, great service, cooling airconditioning, nice view of Sentosa. Good value for mone
5
Went there with a bunch of friends after the colour rush held in sentosa. Best timing to have good food after a long run. We ordered baby pork ribs, pork chop, and fish and chips. The pork chop is way too best! Asked one of the waiter to compliment the chef who served us that night, heard his name is either Kelvin or Kevin. Anyway, keep it up man! Will definitely come again
5
Had baby back ribs and it's so yummy the meat just fall off the bones, definitely one of the best I've had. The rest of my friends are happy with their food too, especially the pork chop! We also shared fried calamari and quesadillas for starters and they were gone within seconds, thumbs up.Service was excellent, 1 of the chef Kevin even came out and had a chat with us. Him and the rest of the waiters are really friendly and prompt at work. Not to forget that the ambiance, we were seated at a table outside overlooking sentosa island. It's really a great place to chill and catch up with friends, with awesome food, top-notch service and nice view.I really can't wait to go back again, there's so many food on the menu that I have my eyes on
5
Just went for dinner with a bunch of friends. Choose a outdoor table and you will have a great night view of Sentosa. Ordered fried calamari and quesadilla for starter. Both are great but the best part is the main dish. The baby back ribs was excellent. The meat was really tender and the portion is more than enough for two, definitely worth the price. A friend ordered chicken chop, was really great too. Will definitely come back again
2
The restaurant was quiet, despite that no one bother to take our orders... my wife had to walk inside the restaurant to seek their attention. The captain (one with the pony tail) was unfriendly and I felt he was doing me a service by taking my orders. During the whole time sitting on the outside for abt 30 mins (there was another family near us ) , no server asked them nor us if we wished anything else or if we want another beer..... I will not come again even if I have to starve..
2
Just went visiting this restaurant at 2 PM. It was post lunch time and crowds are nowhere to be near. We ordered 2 steak and it took them more than half an hour to serve it. Lucky I ordered it medium well, had it been well done, maybe it will be served after sunset. Steak taste was super average. The only thing was nice to us was the dessert. Cheese steak was good and big size. But again, we came for late lunch and not for the dessert.
3
The baby back ribs was very good. However there are 2 main issues :1) the ribs came in 2 slabs. The first slab was the best I've ever eaten...ever! But the second was tough and dry. I think quality control is lacking2) took one hour for our baby back ribs to arrive. (But the first slab was truly worth the wait)Nice beer selection too. Dessert (brownie) was a little too rich for my liking and not adequately balanced with the ice cream. Needed at least to balance the richness.
5
One of the best Restaurant in Singapore with nice food, drinks and great view of sentosa. Frendly and attentive service staff
5
Last evening, my colleague and I went down for dinner at The Chop House. We ordered the Lamb Mixed Grill and the Seafood Mixed Grill. It was awesome!My colleague and I love it! Personally, I love the lamb. It was juicy and tender.Apart from the food, The Chop House is great for a few drinks along the sea! They serve Pure Blonde and Mac's Great White draught beer.Throughout the dinner, we were served by service staff who have great service attitude. Occasionally, they will pop by to our table to ensure that we have a good dining experience.Overall, I must say that The Chop House is a great place for to dine and chill
3
Had dinner over at the restuarant with my family. Set up is clean and neat, staffs are friendly. Had pizza, some pasta and not forgetting the steak. In general, food was good but a little pricey. Ideal for friends get together or you may choose to dine and chill at the alfresco seating
5
Its my second time dining here.Good food and really loved the wings!friendly staff..will be back for more
5
As part of the Wooloomooloo Group, it's no surprise that their steak is fantastic and flavorful. We had our choice of 3 condiments (I liked onion jam the best), but every bite was a battle because the meat was so flavorful that it didn't need an accompanying taste to make it sing.We also sharing the pumpkin soup which was creamy and not overly sweet and cloying. For those who find pumpkin soup as such should get it to share.The cocktails (I got a mango and lychee/raspberry one, my friend got the mojito) were nice and layered with quite a bit of alcohol which is well worth the price.Service was excellent - our ashtray was emptied frequently, iced water always seemed to magically fill itself, and the staff were accommodating to our wish to change tables for our drinks so we were adjacent to the marina and lovely night view.Would definitely recommend
2
My group of friends and I decided to give The Chop House a go after reading reviews on Singaporean food blogs, many highlighting this restaurant's connection to the high-end Wooloomooloo steakhouse. Expectations were high, and our appetite for a good slab of steak was very much evident when we visited the Chop House on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.Service was prompt - although I suspect it was because the place was devoid of other customers when we arrived. Our orders were taken promptly by a friendly waitress, and soon enough, our orders arrived - along with the first signs of trouble.Our order of a ceasar salad with beef fillets and dressing on the side arrived with beef fillets that looked distinctly like dried out beef jerky. The dressing had also already been tossed in, despite our express request to the contrary when we ordered. What made things worse was that when we insisted the kitchen correct our order, instead of immediately returning the dish to the kitchen, the captain was clearly seen looking for our waitress to confirm that we did indeed ask for the dressing to be on the side, as if we made up our request at the last minute.When our steaks arrived, our disappointment continued. The menu said that the steaks were at least 200g each, but when my USDA Prime Ribeye arrived, it looked more like a kids' meal. The strip of beef was, by my estimates, well under 200g in weight and was accompanied by mushy slice potatoes that were overly seasoned.Our order of Berkshire Pork chops was no better - it was literally drowned in a sickly sweet barbecue sauce that drowned out any natural flavour or the pork itself.Just when we thought the meal could not get worse, our seafood platter, comprising of salmon, grilled calamari and shrimp, was labelled as a dish for two, but the portions were so tiny, it was more suited for a single diner. And the seafood was badly prepared. The salmon proved over-done and dry with an oily, mushy skin. The calamari was rubbery and the shrimp had clearly been sitting around the freezers for more than a few days, with an almost chalky mouthfeel when devoured.Overall a very disappointing experience. We didn't even bother with desserts
4
The food and the location at The Chop House is great.Seats are a bit hard but the view makes up for this.The service is a bit slow but relaxing.We had the Mexican chicken fajitas which were sensational
3
We really loved this place on our first visit to Singapore. The food and service weather great but this time service was slow. The cocktail was very good but the crab club sandwhich was drowned in sauce. Price OK but won't go hunting them out again as we did today
3
It's our colleague's birthday and we decided to have dinner and drinks. The food was average and a bit pricy. The service was a bit slow. There's always a delay in any of our orders. The place was just ok, I guess. It has a good view and lighting. But not to be a regular at this place
1
The service is really slow. Asked for well done steak and received medium rare twice. My Husband asked for medium rare tenderloin and received well done. Decided to eat the second one as by this time i was hungry after waiting so long for the food. The quality of the Steak was awful considering it was rib eye. Even had to wait ages for a couple of portions of Steamed veg. Received a couple of free glasses of wine but then received bill with four steaks instead of two. Had to wait ages for revised bill with no apology from the staff. By this time, i was losing the will to live. Paid the bill and left. The staff are slow, unfriendly and i would rather go to Burger king than go to this awful place again
4
The name may sound unrefined to some, but it serves mouth-watering steaks and other dishes. Customers even get a range of garnishings to go with their food - yummy!The waiters are knowledgeable and helpful, and the place is really cosy and wonderful for informal dining. Try it at least once
2
And no need to make formal reservations either; it's never full - for good reasons! At lunch on a Sunday, the restaurant may have been 1/3 full, yet we all waited a long time for the cooked food. We were told there was only ONE chef at the grill (poor person!); meanwhile, at least half a dozen waiters were roaming the dining room, waiting for the food to serve. When the food came, the Cæsar salad was rather lacking in dressing (but with a mountain of fake bacon bits), the pork chop was OK, and the USDA rib eye was soooo tough it's hard to believe it was USDA! Frankly, the décor may be less chic, but the steaks at Eighteen Chefs, which cost a fraction of Chop House's, are much more tender and flavoursome; and at least that serves a good cause. Apparently this location used to be occupied by Carnivore. Maybe the place has bad Feng Shui for meat cooks and eaters. Next one should be vegetarian
3
We visited the Chop House in Vivo City where it took us sometime to attract the attention of a waiter. However, once we got the attention we did get service. This is a general type of restaurant with steak as its main attraction. We had three in our party and ordered Spaghetti Putanesca, Steak Medium Rare and Cumberland Pork Chops. In one word the good was good at a reasonable price. As I started with this review this is a place for a quick bar type meal at a reasonable fare. I dont think I need say more
5
What queens mangosteen lost, this restaurant won. There is only one lady staff and she managed the entire area so well with perfection.She was polite...allow us to sit anywhere. She was good to recommend drinks. Very attentive. Compare her to the Queens mangosteen, where there are many staff on duty outdoor but ineffective.This lady is productive and effective.We had nachos and calamari and beer...We will come back. The view is great too.
5
Tried the pork knuckle platter for the first time today! It was awesome! Juicy in the inside and crisp on the outside. And.......omg, the best truffle potato salad I've had in awhile. Crew were really nice too and friendly. Rare for singapore. Will definitely be back super soon. Thanks Chop House! You made our day :
4
We've eaten here before and mentioned that you need to check availability of some meals in advance. This time was just for lunch and we only wanted light meals. However the portions are very large, with the Bacon, Beef and Cheddar Hamburger quite a handful for me. The youngest child was very happy with the Bangers and Mash and the wife was satistied with Mussels Mariniere and Mussel Soup (although the soup was a bit light on for actual mussels). Reasonably fast service, a nice selection of drinks/beers and the steaks are excellent
5
Was walking past and was in need of a drink. The weather was hot. I was not disappointed. The selection of beers on tap is good. Not many but the ones they have are different to other places. Cheaper too. I recommend the New Zealand beer. It's a delightful cloudy beer. Wasn't in the mood for heavy food so I ordered the nachos. Best nachos ever. So nice. I will return to sample the full food menu soon. The steaks and ribs look amazing. The staff were all friendly and attentive which is quite uncommon in Singapore. Highly recommended
5
Had dinner here last night with a couple of friends, the food was great and value for money! Really nice atmosphere overlooking sentosa island, service was good too. If you are looking for a nice place to dine in and catch up with friends, this is definitely one of the best place to be at in vivo city mall. Eat and chat away buddies
5
Happened to walk in early evening last thursday. Ambiance was great and there were plentiful of welcome smiles. Found an alfresco seatoutside and had a mojito, draught and quesadillas. All were flavourful and enjoyed them. Met Neet the GM and Noel the Boss man. Spent time with some of their guests and had some very good natured banter through out the evening. The menu looked really enticing but will return for a proper meal another day.Great place and wonderful staff.
4
Went with 9 other colleagues and were delightfully taken care of individually by the friendly staff and management. Everyone raved about the food and the desserts were a bonus. Would recommend the place for both business and personal reason
4
The best ribs in Singapore (I have tried three separate places for ribs, so not an extensive review). Delicious fodder for the meat feeder.
3
The Chop House is my favourite local restaurant, no need to book, food is very good quality and no issues on inside/outside dining with a great view of Sentosa.It disappoints every time on drinks service and getting the bill, we get used to it and we are not sure why its constantly this way
4
In Vivo City mall is never easy to find a decent family lunch but this place deliver what's promised on the menu well and efficiently. Good burger
1
The slowest beer in singapura! Up to the third beer, when I gave up and ordered the bill, they took at least five long minutes to bring a single beer!
4
For 6 person, we ordered two mixed grills, one pork chop, two starters, two dessert and one salad. The food were generally good though the lamb was gamey.Service was also excellent. Though the place was not crowded as it's a Monday night, I guess some servers were also off duty so had to get service, example refill of drinks, changing of plates
5
Our 2nd visit here. Prior visit was good. This was excellent. The starters of calamari and the chicken quesadilla were pleasant. Mains of lemon chicken, lamb chops and salmon were delicious. Plates were eaten clean. The service a great and attention. Even a mistake made with the favorite sweet potatoe fries not delivered. The manager made sure to serve it on the house even if we would take it home. Overall this visit was a great feel good dinner experience. Now I'm sure to return when in vivo city again.
3
We called in for a bite to eat before going to the cinema. WE ordered two mains and a glass of wine each. Wine was fine but they could not serve the two mains together in fact they were 20 minutes apart....not good.The food was good, the staff friendly enough and a good looking menu...we live local so would probably give it another shot but they have some work to do if they want to guarantee regular customers
3
We came here for seaside lunch on a weekday. We were seated outside. Fortunately it wasnt too hot since there were fans around. We ordered 2 lunch sets which were the fish appetiser and pasta. Salad with burger and fries and another pork burger. The fried fish was not bad. The salad however was not up to par. The veggie looked slightly wilted, insufficient sauce. Overall it looked and tasted like some raw veggie instead of a restaurant salad. The two burgers were juicy and tasty and the most promising dish was the fries which was cooked to perfection. Pasta was not bad but wasnt too fantastic. Something i think i can achieve at home. We also ordered an apple strudel dessert which took half an hour to arrive despite chasing for it twice. Although we were not in a rush to go off, it was a bit annoying waiting for it. When it came the apple strudel was also not fantastic. The ice cream was runny and tasted abit odd.I would come back for the burger and fries but definitely not the rest
4
We found this place as refuge during a big storm and therefore spent a little longer than we had originally anticipated having food and drink whilst watching sport on the television in the bar.The bar whilst not busy had a good feel to it and I would expect very buzzy in the evening. Service was good and attentive leading us to buy a few more drinks as we enjoyed ourselves.The menu is good, not cheap but ok ( have to pay for your sides). The food was very good and well presented.Not perfect by any means but worth picking out of the sizeable competition in the VivoCity centre
3
We had dinner for 8 as part of a business group and found the service was ok, but the steaks left a little to be desired. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. The location on the other hand is great on the harbor and very relaxing
4
Situated in VivoCity shopping mall.Caters for all...family ...couples friends ...with both indoor and outdoor seating.Predominately meat based dishes,,,Steaks,,,lamb chops ...burgers ... etcInclude some sharing dishes too which are goodThe small beef wellington starters are really quite niceMeat is of reasonable quality and price.Staff can be slow at times but the manager always tries to keeps them on their toes.
4
We enjoyed the Norwegian salmon and the lamb chop. Both nicely cooked. Lamb was two pieces but good sized. Red wine sauce was not working this time. The sauce for the salmon was good and went well with the creamy mash side. By the way for the elegant dishes you have to order and pay for sides separately. The other side purchase was sweet potatoes chips. Very good. I forget about the Quesadilla starter which was good too. So overall good meal. With two cooldrinks the bill totaled S$118 including the service charge and tax. So on the unsightly higher side. Would I come back here? Yes most likely.
5
We are not big fans of restaurants in shopping malls but this is a big exception. Both indoors and outdoors (facing the water) have a great vibe. Music is always great. We've been 5 or 6 times and on all those occasions, except 1, we have had great service. We've been to Jamie Olivers next door - whilst we are big fans of Jamie's, Chop House in Singapore wins hands down for us, sorry Jamie. It's owned by a steak house chain (Wooloo-mooloo) so the quality of the meat is always good. Fab wines from NZ at great prices. On our last visit we tried the Mysterious Juniper Lillet cocktail - AMAZING ! The Manager even wrote down the recipe for us. We will be back !
5
Went to chop house for Halloween cos they had the nicest decorations in Vivo. Really enjoyed ourselves. We had the chicken nachos, garlic mushroom toasts to share for starters and two steaks and a burger. As always food didn't disappoint. Took a bit long for the initial greeting maybe cos they were busy but smooth sailing after that. Must go!!:
1
Friday night and all places were booked. The only place that didn't have a queue was chop house. Excited that it had Halloween decorations, we decided to to try it out. The server took our orders and we ordered two burgers and a bottle of wine. After 20 minutes there was no sign of the food or the wine. We asked for water, and they said they'd come back. Asked to check on the wine and they said they'd come back. From my seat I saw my bottle of white wine sitting on the bar, not being chilled but just sitting there. Food arrived 20 minutes later and we still had no water, no wine. We asked again for the drinks and finally the water arrived. They said they would check on the wine, I could still see it from where I was sitting but no one bothered to bring it over. When the burgers were served, they didn't ask if we needed any sauces or anything. So we decided we'd have to help ourselves. So had to get our own chilli sauce and black pepper. I finished my burger, and then the wine finally came to the table. The server asked us to try the white wine and poured it out. It was not chilled and that was the last straw. The server could sense my dissatisfaction but he chose to ignore it. After our food was finished they took another 20 minutes before they cleared our plates. I highly do not recommend this place. The burger patty was powdery and under seasoned. Servers are terrible. Not worth a visit.
5
One of my restaurant of choice when I'm in the area. Order their pork chop and lamb chop, they're grilled to perfection! Not to mention the interesting self tapping beer option. They charge per ml and it's only $9 per pint
4
Celebrated a post birthday dinner with some friends. We got to sample some of the tap beers before making a selection and ordering our food. The Food was good and portions were generous enough. The Beef was tender and the Pork succulent. My Friend asked for just a simple candle on a dessert but, was we got instead was a customized dessert plate with my Name and Happy Birthday written. Our waiter Dominic was both professional and took care of us professionally as well as entertained us with his antics. He made the celebration complete
3
Ran out of space at Jamie's and got really hungry, so decided to give chop house a try. Heard it is the sister company of Wooloomooloo, and we are fans of that brand. Sad to say this does not deliver to the standard but it is so-so for the price you pay.
2
Very surprised by the positive reviews. Visited this place twice and will not return. Food was cold and tasteless (I ordered the steak). Spinach was left off one of the dishes even though it was listed as part of the dish and another arrived with a grand total of 6 fries (see photo). The overall quality of the food reminded me of an IKEA restaurant - fine if you're paying $10. The waiter explained away the measly portions by saying that the fries etc were 'garnish' - not a word I recall seeing on the menu - so I guess you can call that false advertising. To be fair, a waitress did bring more fries but it was all quite uncomfortable having to point out the obvious.The Chop House is not one thing or the other. They have a lot to learn from Jamie's (and I am not that restaurant's number 1 fan either). Next time I am visiting VivoCity, I will go back to Jamie's or, if I was looking for more bang for my buck, head to the food court. Shame as I was really hoping I would like this place the second time around
4
I have dined in this restaurant twice. What I loved about the restaurant are the ambience and the quality of the food. The steak is grilled according to my doneness, and there is a slight charcoal aroma on the steak. Maybe they used charcoal fire for cooking.The portion of the steak could be larger. But, considering the price (about S$30), it is quite cheap to get that quality of the steak and that service of the staffs
5
The food was excellent and price was reasonable. We enjoyed ourselves very much and will definitely visit The Chop House again. 
5
The Chop House' soon became my favorite restaurant at the first time I visited. They serve exclusive burgers with tasty steak in it, which is truly outstanding! I can declare that this restaurant is highly suggeste
5
It's my first review. I can't help logging in to write a review because I felt a kind of guilty knowing this nice restaurant alone.I've been to lots of restaurant in various countries but I've never seen this kind of restaurant. I really want to share my unforgettable experience here in TCH. Staffs are very very kind, cool and careful and It is located in a good place with a really nice view. Seeing sentosa's beautiful night view and hearing a music, I fell in love with this restaurant. Most of all, Food was beyond my imagination. I've never thought a burger can be quality and gourmet food like this.(I ate chop house burger and mussel spagetti and I highly recommand them) If anyone visit singapore, what I can say for sure is this is a Must-Go place in singapore!
4
My wife and I went in this restaurant in Vivo city after checking out a few menus. It has a good range of mainly western meat options, burgers, steaks, Mexican. The service was good and the food was very nice. We both had burgers which were very substantial and come with a basket of small potato croquets, but we also ordered sweet potato fries which were very nice. You can sit outside or inside, we decided to sit in the air conditioned inside but the outside tables have nice views over towards Sentosa island. All in all very good, our bill for 2 meals, 2 drinks and a side was S$80, about £40 which was roughly the average in Singapore for us
2
We have eaten here 3-4 times but I think I would have to say this would be the last. Had meat platter for 2. Medium. Came out rare and cold. When I asked the sever to cook abit more he took it away, same server brought it back and placed on table, two words were spoken rudely..Cut? Ok? Then walked away. For the price you pay and service like that on such a quite night I was shocked. It was Always a favorite place to come when visiting vivo city.

Title: Meat Galore! There are many chain restaurants that open up in malls and I am always sceptical about them.I chanced upon The Chop House when a friend organized a gathering and boy was I surprised by the quality they offered.Between the 6 of us, we started off our meal with chicken quesadillas and crispy calamari to share. Not forgetting some ice-cold beers as well that came in chilled mugs – heavenly combination indeed. Although we pre-ordered a beef shank lollipop meant for a party of 4 to 6, we could not resist the temptation of ordering an additional mixed grill platter and sweet potato fries! Turned out, the beef shank was the largest portion of meat I have ever attempted to conquer.Our stomachs were filled to the brim at the end of the session. I have to admit that we ordered way too much food. Nonetheless, we enjoyed ourselves immensely in the laid back atmosphere.Also we were seated on the wooden benches and could not help but notice a few tables with dedicated “taps”. After clarifying with the staff, we found out that they were self service beer dispensers. I am definitely going to return to the restaurant for the wide array of beers on tap and perhaps I will give the baby back ribs a try the next time
2
We went to the Chop House hoping for a decent steak at a midrange price. What we got was a mediocre steak and lousy service. The steaks here are no better than the fast food like Aston's
5
On our first night in Singapore my partner and I decided to have a walk around Vivocity and wanted to eat dinner on the waterfront. We decided on the Chop House, as fancied a burger after our 13hour flight.I can honestly say it was the tastiest burger I've ever had! We both agreed. We had the BBQ bacon burger. Lovely view of the waterfront, good music and fun atmosphere. This was a Monday night so I can only imagine how great it would be on a Friday night for example.We will definitely be back to sample something else on the menu
5
Came with my 7 year old daughter, who loves steaks, for a treat. And she got one- perfect Sirloin at 27$, mocktails at 8$ and outstanding service by Mr. Raja. My daughter's comments: " this is the best steak in Singapore, but I only like to come when Uncle Raja is here".I agree
5
One of my absolute favorite places in Singapore. The Chop House is perfect for any occasion - burger brunch, cocktails on the boardwalk, or an evening with friends. It's also the best for big parties. Our office Christmas lunch was here and it was the most fun - and most talked about - event of the year. The Chop House team (especially the boss man, Noel) is truly outstanding and always willing to go the extra mile. The crab sandwich and cocktails cannot be beat.
4
The mall at the harbor front was closing, the restaurants had already seated their last guests and we were turned away from all eating establishments with a courteous 'thank you but we are closed message'. In the midst of it all we discovered The Chop House open for another half hour to take our order. The service was pleasant and unobtrusive and the food quality was way above par. The chicken quesadilla was cheesy and well flavoured though the guacamole dip would not inspire anyone to dip anything in it. The beef burgers were perfectly done and the fries were salted and crisp. The salad, even that late in the evening, was crisp and the helpings were more than adequate. We were quite taken aback that we could get good food at this time without anyone wanting us to move out in a hurry. Thank you Chop House for a good evening topped by a filling meal that ensured that we did not have to go to McDonalds for dinner.! I would visit again to try the steaks! They looked good and will have to wait another day
5
Ended up here two days in a row!!Nice location outside of the hustle and bustle of the mall. After a long hard week working it was a real treat to come here for dinner.A real hoot to see tater tots served with a buger. Real memories of a Canadian childhood. Excellent bun on a well presented burger, no crumble factor. Good beer and happy hour always makes me happy!!Have to thank the staff as I stoopidly left my phone behind, they kept it safe and I collected it thw next day and has the cesaer salad which was delicious and had a great night before a long flight back to London. Thanks again to a super friendly team you are a credit to The Chop House. I will recommend to my Singapore work colleagues.

We were wandering around Vivo City looking for Carnivores which has since closed as we found out. This looked like a great alternative. The signature dish of beef shank for 4-6 people looked awesome. However, having booked, checked in, ordered drinks and settled down for our meal order we found it wasn't available. It would have been nice if it had been mentioned in advance. After that, mixed grill was very good, and most other meals ordered by our party of 10 were acceptable in quantity and taste. A good night out, just be sure what's available before you try. it

We've been here a few times and although the service is hit a miss at time the food is excellent and the beer and wine list extensive.Prices a fair for Singapore but still not cheap when the wine is flowing. And lets not forget the riverside view of an evening

We were really pleasantly surprised by this place. Too often in Singapore I have been presented with a very over priced and mediocre steak but here the food was fairly priced and tasted great! The steak was cooked perfectly and my partner who had the lamb was equally impressed! The service was also excellent, very friendly staff that knew their food and wine menus well (another rarity here!). We will definitely be back and would highly recommend it!!

The steaks we had were well seasoned and well cooked. The atmosphere on the patio was excellent and we enjoyed looking out over the water and Sentosa Island while dining

Despite not so good reviews of the restaurant, i've decided to give it a go with my girlfriends for a girls night out. Boy!! These people are so WRONG!! Everything about The Chop House is a spot on for us. GREAT SERVICE, AWESOME MUSIC SELECTIONS, YUMMY FOOD AND WIDE SELECTIONS OF BEERS, COCKTAILS & WINES!! We had a great night out and will be back for sure. A MUST TRY Restaurant!

I've been here twice now for dinner and my wife has been here on another occasion for dinner, things were a little slow when they first opened last year but my visit last week was fantastic. We sat outside and enjoyed our dinner and drinks, keep up the good work, we will be back

I heard about The Chop House from a colleague of mine and decided to give it a try since she raved about the food and service. My expectations were high and I am very happy to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. The service was exceptional from the moment my boyfriend and I walked in to the moment we left. The staff seemed genuinely glad to serve us. It was a joy to feel so welcome to dine at The Chop house. The casual ambiance was on point. The woody interior gives the place a certain charm that we both liked very much, and everything else, such as the music and well-chosen lighting definitely enhanced the mood. As for the food, I was extremely impressed. Thumbs up for both presentation and taste. The Ribeye is the winner that was served with peppercorn sauce on the side which is one the best I have tasted. My boyfriend had the heavenly Carl's Jr version of Beef BBQ bacon burger although is gets messy, but according to one of the waitress Fae, it's a given with an awesome burger. The Chop House is THE place for steaks and burgers and we will come back for more. This place will be our place to chill out with a nice waterfront view of Sentosa, be it with my boyfriend or my group of friends. Kudos to the team! Awesome job, well done, blew me away...

Chop House, belogning to the same people who runs Woolloomooloo can't seem to decide if it wants to be a bar or a meat restaurant, As a result the patrons suffer. First off, cocktails were awful - this was my second visit and this time the Mojito tasted like sugared water. Best to order bottled beer.For starters my companion had the mussels - she said they were nice; and I had the rather mediocre mussel soup. For main course she had a steak - that looked rather small, and I ordered a pork chop that never came.Asked the waiter who took the order and he said "I'll expedite that for you," then started to enter the order. Obviously he has forgotten it in the first place.Meantime my companion was about to finish her mini-steak, so I cancelled my pork chop.It was nice of them to give a 10% off after offering some half-sincere apologies but with this experience, the schizophrenic Chop House just got chopped off my list of places to go to.

Was here while on vacation last week, we wanted to eat at the restaurant beside but queue was so long we decided to reserve a seat here at chop house, front desk manager was kind of rude, when we were asking about out seats, she answered rudely saying we had to wait a long time, good thing someone from the restaurant came out and said they had seats available in the outdoor area, so now to the food, food was great, the burger and the meat platter was perfect! The waitress assigned to us was very helpful, beer was great too! A must try

We have dined at Chop house several times now and we absolutely love the casual upscale pub feel. The service is fantastic, food is delicious (try the lamb--amazing!) and the beer is delicious! I am not a fan of mall restaurants but this one is really a gem in VivoCity. I also love their Sunday brunch :).

Been to chop house a few times already, and every time, I've been there, it has been excellent. I have no idea where some of these negative reviews are coming from. Probably from nitpicky diners. Food is value for money. The steak is excellent especially the USDA Prime Rib. I've also had the Mixed Grill which is enough for two and also good value if you want some steak and some lamb chops. The baby back ribs are pretty divine as well. For the starters, I highly recommend the tater tots, the sweet potato fries, and best of all, the unparalleled quesadillas. I also like the calamari but sometimes it can be hit and miss. The Mussel soup and the Mussel dish is also very yummy if you like mussels. They don't stint on the mussels. As for desserts, the dark chocolate lave cake is magnificent. I also like the Apple strudel. For me, the drinks concept in this place is just fantastic. I mean, Jamie's Italian next door pales in comparison. The beers on tap are excellent, and I highly recommend getting one of their beer tap tables if you're going with a group. We had a $100 stored value on our card, and it seemed like an endless amount of beer. Plus you had the great fun of tapping it yourself right at your table! Pure genius. For those who enjoy cocktails, this place is heaven Try the Japanese Yen with its excellent sake mix. Omg... Really, really good. Cannot praise this drink enough. Their version of the Long Island Tea is great and the watermelon mojito is refreshing. Service is good. I found the managers to be excellent. They're always around and very obliging. Some of the staff might be new and some are young but no one is ever rude. There was one occasion when something was not quite right, and they changed it without argument. And they threw in a complimentary dessert to make up for their mistake. I always found them to be friendly especially if you also treat them with decency and respect. Will be back here more in the future. Am bringing my colleagues here on Xmas eve to chill and have a great time. By the way, they also have live football on screens. Love it! Good job to the folks at Woolloomooloo!

Love this restaurant! This is my third visit. Food here is delicious. I first came here with my friends in Nov 2013 and we tried their sweet potato fries, crispy calamari, chicken quesadilla (to die for), steaks (yummmy!), and meat platter. We were recommended to try their dark chocolate tart for desserts, and it was the seal for a really delicious dinner. One thing that is unique about this restaurant is that there are a few tables with a running beer tap which i thought was really useful, as we can just refill our beers as and when we wish. The staff are very friendly and the service was efficient. The manager of the restaurant in particular was very friendly and help ensure that our orders were delivered. Ambiance is awesome with great music. In my opinion, this is an excellent place to chill out

Went there twice on dinner occasions and came out both times smiling. Great food with meticulous service from the freindly and helpful staff won the day (or night to be exact) for Chop House. To top it off, the pricing points for its offerings offer great value too. Compared to its more illustrious neighbour, Chop House will remain my preferred choice any day
