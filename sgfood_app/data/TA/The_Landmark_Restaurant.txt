Food was above expectations and even with large crowds. Food was refilling at a decent speed. Never been disappointed with the food at landmark

Nice food, nice view. Good service.
Will sure recconmemd people to have dinner at the buffet. A chill place to eat

Pros: Good spread, great food. Plates are cleared timely. Food was replenished on the spot. Love the variety of food choices available esp the fish head curry.
Cons: Space constrain.
5
Various choices of food with reasonable price per pax. Muslim and elderly guest friendly. Highly recommended
4
Excellent widespread dishes. Sat is busy: hence the service is challenging. But overall it is a worthwhile booking!

We were in Landmark Restaurant for the first time to celebrate CNY Lunch with family. it was a great spread with good local delights. The seafood are really fresh and it is really a worth trip to the restaurant. We will definitely come back and will recommend this restaurant to all to visit. The place can be small but the good food will makes you forget the space constraints.

Am here for lunch and the food quality is pretty good. Satay tastes superb, so juicy and tender, although the satay sauce is slightly too watery. Beef rendang sedap! Sweet and aromatic sauce, with beef cut in cubes that absorbed the sauce and yet tender, this combination is best accompanied with white rice! Cold Mussels are cooked to the best level! They retained their full sweetness, the meat was tender and not dry at all, with a springy touch! The stir fried clams are cooked wonderfully and really clean (elsewhere will have eaten sand of some sort) and the sauce is really flavorful

My MIL has been saying wanted to go to The Landmark to eat Tulang. So I made a "Chope" reservation for my family of 16 pax for her 70th birthday celebration. I went to the restaurant first as my husband was finding a carpark lot. The manager asked me whether some of my guests had arrived., which is no. Apparently, my table has been given to other customer as they have mistaken that the other customer was me. Luckily, there was still other table available and the manager quickly arranged the table before my rest of family members arrived.The recommendation is the "live station" which BBQ satay and tiger prawns. Very tender, soft and delicious. However, only available during dinner. The tulang Â was only available during weekends.Basically, my family had enjoyed the buffet. We saw Chef Bob and he was very friendly smiling at us. The swimming pool area was spacious for us to take photos with family.However, due to the crowd and queue, I find the buffet area, which is at the corner is very cramping
4
Good spread of dish from local,Indian and Mediterranean food.Love the naan and satay. Appetizer and main course was delicious. slightly disappointed with dessert choice.my favorite bread pudding was dry and cold. other than that the rest was very good.although restaurant was crowed but the food was replenished and the staffs was attentive to all customers
3
Came for the buffet with a family party of 16 for a birthday celebration.
We were given two tables of 8. Not ideal but ok.
Food was limited in choice and average in standard but value for the relatively low price for a hotel buffet.
4
Value for money. The spread is good and especially a lot of seafood varieties. The downside, not all items are tasty and too crowded (you may have to stay in a long queue !!!)
4
The lunch buffet is generally quite busy so reservations are strongly recommended. If you like Indian food, there is a good selection of many popular favorites. Discount coupons are widely available on line which will make this buffet a good bargain.

Food is average, not so wow. Booked table for 12pax.. and arrangement was horrible. Tables and chairs were too close with another group. Hard to move our chairs. Those with babies, pray hard that they don't poop. Cos I experience that I need to change my baby diaper, I couldnt find changing diaper room not even in the toilet. My husband & I approached the counter staff, ask her if there's any, she simply say NO with no eyes contact and continue chatting with another staff, I have no choice but to change at the pool side (open space...
3
Brought my family of 5 adults for lunch. But given table for 4. On one side, 3 seats are squeezed into a table meant for 2. Mentioned to the waitress about it, but she said she could not do anything because the table was already reserved for us. It really killed our mood.The funny thing is, the table beside us which was for 8, occupied by family of 4 that includes 2 young teenagers. Also saw 2-3 tables for 4, occupied by 2 diners.
3
The place was very crowded to the extent that the waiters and waitresses couldn't keep up with clearing the plates and cutlery on tables during the dinner buffet. The layout of the buffet was such in a way that made it inconvenient for diners to queue properly.

I attended a 1-day WSQ CERT (Company Emergency Response Team) course at the 6th floor of Victoria Hotel Bugis. Limited complimentary parking coupons were also given to participants. Most of the participants were sponsored by their company. On my own, I paid $50/- for the course which could be reimbursed from my organization once I have completed the course. The full course fee is $950/- but WDA (Work Development Force) subsidized $900/- for the course. I am glad that the training company held the workshop at this hotel. The environment is conducive and both tea refreshment and lunch are provided.We proceeded to the Landmark Restaurant at the 5th floor for our lunch. I was really surprised that the lunch was international buffet and the atmosphere at the restaurant was so relaxed and the food gorgeous. I came to know that it would cost about $25/- for one to pay just for the lunch which means to say that the course fee of only $50/- for the one day course including lunch and tea breaks is really value for money. At my age of 58, I am always careful of overly indulging and mindful of too high a calories consumption. But right in front of me the most tempting most appetizing, most delicious and most sumptuous of the food varieties spread right in front of me and I really could not resist the urge to continue one plate after another. The spicy chicken, the tender beef and mutton, the soft fish meat mixed all of them in my Nasi biryani on a plate made my stomach growls and I gobbled them down in less than 10 minutes. The next plate I filled all of them with prawns and crabs and satay. It was decorative on the plate and made me feel so appetizing and again, I gobbled them down my throat in less than 10 minutes. The last plate was filled with the sweet kweh kweh, cakes and muffins and a bowl of green beans. I just could not resist them and gobbled down again in just few mins. By now, I could feel the heavy load in my stomach but tempted again, I forced down another last slice of pizza to end my gastronomic venture. When I finally returned to my classroom, I could feel the drowsiness in my head as the blood rushed to the stomach to aid the digestion.It is really interesting to combine food with knowledge providing the best nourishment for the day. The staff at the restaurant was very helpful in clearing the plates fast. It would be ideal that the food can be replenished fast. When I took the photos, many of the pots and plates were empty and I missed the opportunity to showcase and make free advertisement for the restaurant. The food here are halal-certified and I could see that the restaurant is favored by our Malay Singaporeans who came here in swarm for their lunch.Overall, I think the food is value for money. If there is a chance I would like to eat here again

Is the worst buffet I ever had. Went with my team and was totally disappointed.The food quality was not expected at all! Very bad. Is either to salty? Or no taste at all.Black pepper prawn and the chilly card was totally disaster! Too salty and not fresh plus greasy. My staff were complaining since their 1st plate. Also, the layout for the buffet line were distorted. People came to cut queue and you easily bum into one another like you are at Chatuchak Market. Honestly? Embarrassing for us as Manager to bring our staffs there.Cashier almost forgot to return my Credit card but only my corporate card! (Wonder what she want to do with my credit card?)..Will never return
3
Not the usual wide spread menu for the price that you are paying for. Selection was okay, just that hot food were not hot enough, and desserts and fruits were not cold enough. Replenishment of food was slow. But overall food taste and ambience is still there. Can consider to dine here for a value for money buffet
3
We came at 2.30pm and were advised to sit at the pool area since lunch hour has just ended and the staff have to clean up the main restaurant and set up for dinner. However it was too hot outside so we came back inside and ordered from the menu. Strangely, the staff were all having their lunch break INSIDE the restaurant. The loud conversations exchanged around the tables were unusual for a restaurant in a hotel in Spore. It was somewhat unprofessional. Towards the end, a waiter started clearing some plates from the buffet counter and again it was unnecessarily loud and intrusive. Perhaps the restaurant should consider closing right after the lunch hour to allow the staff to eat and clear up with as much noise without disrespecting the presence of a paying customer. The food was decent but not value for money.
4
There is a good amount of variety of food. The atmosphere of the area is good and the a crew is friendly and prompt.
5
Best halal international buffet in Singapore. For mere $25 so much to choose from. Buffet highlights include chilli crab, tiger prawn, roasted beef, seafood on the ice and lot more...
4
Food was good. Ambience great.. it would be good if food is refilled faster.. Service was great as well
4
Value for money with reasonable spread of food choices! There were many sections, including seafood and flower crabs!
4
Certified halal restaurant with affordable price. Variety wasn’t that much. Excellent service for the staffs. Received complimentary birthday cake for my partner. Thank you!

Breakfast was so-so but the milk tea was nice!
Breakfast buffet spread - not so much choice
Certified Halal Restaurant

I reached there and the manager told me there wasn’t any reservations. Worst experience through Chope.
3
The Landmark has a good seating area and offers a pretty decent buffet breakfast but vegetarians have limited options here. I would reccomend them to have different options. They repeat the breakfast options for vegetarians every 3rd day
1
Waitress was rude n been told off by her that my Friend left her plate on other table. We understand Dec Seasons period busy n we help ourselves clear the plates passed to the waiter. Waiter hands were full and told my Friend to leave it on the other table . Another waitress saw it n walked over to our table to inform us not to leave the plate on other desk with her unfriendly tone. We were upset with the service cos that waitress told my Friend off was the Brithday Gal!

Purchase voucher online, $22.91 after discount. No more squid like last time. Prawn very fast taken, same as satay. Very value for money. Lobby is at level 3 , swimming pool and restoran at level 5. Carpark is $1.90 first hour, $1 for subsequent hour. Curry, mutton, beef rendang, ice cream, deserts, chili crab (no pincer, only leg). Price was good. Due to over crowded on weekends, 4 pax table becomes 6 pax sitting area. Staff clear plates very fast. Some dishes, they refill very fast. Not for satay, chili crab, prawns, mussels
4
We had breakfast and lunch at this restaurant during our stay at Singapore. They served good Indian food. Also staff was very supportive.
4
My visit to The Landmark was interesting and my family was able to experience quality food. There were many different varieties that they were able to enjoy. However, we do hope for more different types of flavoured ice-creams.
4
Service by staff was excellent. Attentive to customers needs Food was reasonably good. Value for money.
4
Pretty good food but Limited selection
Some foods could be better but the ones that were good were really good
5
It was a family dinner. The food was great. It was my mom's bday and she's in love with the choices of food.
3
So pack w male..food was so so.
Wrong day to go.
All food was gone so fast but it was replenished sn.

Went to The Landmark for the 1st time on a public holiday (Deepavali).Obviously, the crowd is expected to be alot. But my party of 6 got in quickly with a reservation within 1min. They had a small salad bar, fried items such as onion rings, banana fritters, pizza, nasi briyani, dory fish, chilli crab, roasted beef, chicken, vegetable dishes, hummus, baba ganoush, kebab wraps, seafood spaghetti, tandoori chicken with naan, chicken keema, vegetable stew, fresh mussels & prawns, desserts such as 2-4 type of icecream (which they change flavours), churros, some Indian sweets like burfi, cheesecakes, puddings such as bread & mango pudding, soft drinks & coffeee machine...I'm just listing what I can remember. The spread is so-so, limited of course, compared to the other halal buffets such as Carousel or Aquamarine. Taste is average, I'm afraid. Try to get indoor (aircon)- we got outdoor at the patio next to the pool, which was still windy but on that day, it was extremely humid & hot. If you want cheap food but don't want to splurge more than $30-50 on a typical buffet, you should try The Landmark

Unsure of this hotel is actually part of Village Hotel Bugis or not. I suspect independently managed/owned .... too good for the hotel.Buffet lunch S$25.00Huge range of Malay, Indian, and hot and cold western foods. Crowded, noisy, but enthusiastic diners. Great service.Big focus on seafood and also Malay sweets which one doesn't see to often and which are very sweet.Lots of cheap local restaurants nearby all of which are excellent, but on a hot day on what's probably been a hectic holiday, the dining room provides welcome respite at a bargain price.Top marks
1
Price is good. Food wise is average. Ambience and customer service is bad. Its so cramped indoors that you can practically hear the next table's conversation. I spend more time in line for the food than actually eating it. Went on a Saturday evening and everything stopped being topped up at 9pm. Utterly dissapointed. I sat next to the drinks dispenser and practically got acquainted with each and every patron. Ohhhhh the best part would be waiting for clean plates to be replenished. Don't think I will be back unless major changes are made.
4
we, 14 of us arrived and was seated at a long table meant for 10 diners. it was very crammed and we hardly had any space to move around. The food have a large variety to chose from unfortunately much sought favourites like satay has a long wait before we even get to taste it. Overall all the food are good and we will definitely go there again
3
Before I headed to the restaurant, I had a glimpse of the menu and was pretty impressed. But the dinner was only average. But for $30++ for a buffet in Bugis, it is average. Service was good though.
4
Having stayed here for a night, had a chance to taste their buffet spread of Breakfast which was quite good & sumptuous.
5
Variety of food was good. Tandoor chicken was very soft and tasty. Tulang, satay and all other dishes was above average. Worth every penny spend.
4
Staffs are well-mannered, deco was clean and bright.! Enjoyed a good buffet spread even though some meat were quite tough to chew on.!
3
- Service was good.
- Top up of food was slow
- Did not standby cutlinaries for outdoor seaters
- Crowd control at the front counter was bad
2
The place was too crowded during the lunch, which resulted in food running out very fast.
Variety and quality weren't fantastic and the replenishment was a bit slow.
4
Good food, happy with the varieties of dishes as I'm non seafood person but I could find enough of other items 😋
5
Fantastic atmosphere with pool view, live band and friendly waiters. Not to forget...FANTASTIC FOOD!
4
Went there for lunch buffet and i paid almost $50 for 2 pax.Not a lot of spread but still quite ok as there are chilli crab, mantao buns, lala, hummus dip, kebab and few otheres.For desserts only nyonya kueh and fruits available.But its worth the money for that kind of spread.Yet to try the dinner spread
3
Went here for iftar and we got a table next to the swimming pool. Like the ambience. Food is ok to me, above average but not fantastic. Maybe because its fasting month, so my taste buds are on and off. Haha. The only thing that I dislike is their ice-cream. Come on, get a better one. Even a soft serve taste better than the cups you provided.Overall I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to satisfy their stomach.
3
It was way to crowded, we couldn't really enjoy the food. Due to the lack of space, the seats were congested.
5
A lot of food variety. Comfortable seats and dining experience. Cleaniness at its best. Highly recommended for birthday or anniversary treats.
5
Wide variety of food, cold dish, soup, briyani, naan, dessert..endless. It will definitely be a next time.
5
I like all the food and value for money. I will probably come again to have lunch and dinner with friends and family.
1
Too little spread and the food is below average. Food consisted of large volume of MSG as we felt extremely thirsty after eating. Not recommended and will not visit again
2
Reserved for 6 adults and 2 children for mother's day which was clearly stated on the reservation page and confirmation email. But was told it was reserved for 6 pax. Older of the 2 children is at 9yrs old and still wanted to charge at adult fare. Lucky charged us at child fare after staff knew she doesn't eat much for a child. Mum was in wheelchair but we were given a table at a corner with not much space and under the super strong air con area. Choice of dishes vary big time from the menu (weekend). The only plus point is that there's live performance and the staff are helpful and courteous.
2
Thought it would be an exclusive spread since they advertised introducing Singapore chefs on live station etc. But there wasn't any chef on that weekend and worst of it all, the food was just a so so and dessert corner, especially on the cake and kuih spread, it was just a cheapskate spread where i could find it at hawker centre stall. Service from the staffs truly uncalled for. No warming welcome. Frontline gives a face of 'not willing to work' on that day. Savoury and fried stuffs like crinkled fries, samosas and whatever fritters you may call it, not even in category of delicious. Homemade self are even nicer.Well, from such restaurant, they should at least serve tasty food even though it is a simple cuisine for asians. Even fastfood restaurant serve tasty fries. The only food that i can give a thumbs up is the satay corner. Unfortunately, the poor staff has to bbq it in a closed area where I can see he is feeling definitely hot and stuffy. Poor guy. Wondering if he has any difficulty to breathe. Management need to look into it. Not going to return there for any birthday celebration though. Despite having booking for the whole family, no compliments of a mini cake given for us to celebrate the joy in that restaurant. Poor service. We were told off with sarcastic expression that we should buy it from them instead! Such a standard, you lose a few customers definitely.

The Landmark is located at Level 5 of the Village Hotel Bugis. Was here on a Friday evening for a gathering. It served buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner; as well as ala Carte menu. The Landmark is a Halal Certified Restaurant serving both Western and Asian cuisines thus catering to a larger group.The space is quite large with some seats ‘alfresco style’ by the poolside! And it does offer some good views of the sky and neighbouring buildings. We find the Indoor seat a bit cramped and noisy for our party of 14 so opt for external one. It can be quite noisy but who cares -> the company matter more!. They have a reasonable spread for buffet and the selections include: salads, Pizzas, Pastas, chicken nuggets, white and briyani rice, & wraps etc. At a corner is servings of roast Beef, Chilli Crab and Seafood (prawns and oysters), the heavier meal. There are also local dishes like tulang (mutton bone) Soup, Naan, Indian Dishes plus desserts and drinks. If you prefer hot drinks an espresso machine delivers good cappuccino!. Only the satay is good but be prepared for long wait! Btw they are served and prepared on the roof terrace.In terms of food my take is that it is still considered a small spread only. And taste only average too. The staff are helpful but it does not help with a large crowd, cannot quite get their attention when you need help.. Still an interesting place to be especially for the price of $30++ per pax (we use groupon tickets
2
Not much variety... No speciality in dishes. Stew beef not tender. Tandoori chicken very spicy. Slow in top up. Not worth money spent. Would rather go the cafes along Arab street. NO place for prayer allocated & expected to go Sultan Mosque. Inconvenient to elderly & with young kids. Will NOT return

I was having workshop event on 26 Feb 2017, at Sapphire from 3pm-7pm, The arrangement was perfect. mike system, and other logistics were also very good. The following staff Howard , Sham, Avinesh and Azmeer , were extremely helpful and their service was extremely excellent in all aspects. .The room was clean. ambient and good lighting. Pl convey our thanks to them also.RegardsShaik AlaudeenNew Resources Service
1
we have made reservation and instead of giving what we have asked. They placed us somewhere else.
indicated as buffet but variety is so little to choose. and the drink vending machine kept on repairing. not worth to the price
4
The Buffet has a wide selection of dishes to cover all tastes and a great variety of Asia. Well presented and enjoy the tastes and experience
4
Good ambience, quality food, buffet breakfast is amazing, indian cuisine readily available. Jain food available on request.
5
Everything was available including good coffee. All tastes catered for. My finicky 12 year old was happy as well. Helpful staff
1
The place was crammed up and hazardous. Our movements around the restaurant was very restricted and caused my uncle to trip and fell and fractured his leg.
Although they charge the kids for the buffet but there isnt any food catered for the kids also.
3
Had dinner and breakfast here. The food was very average and not much of a European selection. Would not eat there again.
5
The place has an amazing view. The staff was not soo friendly but maybe because they were tire as the place is very packed and busy. They have a very wide spread for buffet with different variety of cuisine that can be found. Seating area buy the pool was abit akward as i find it funny watching people playing in the swimming pool while we are eatin
4
Very good food. Butter chicken with naan is highly recommended! Wide variety of cuisine. Can be more especially for the price (30++ per pax)Pizza, pasta, steak, rice, wraps, desserts, traditional kuih, seafood and more available. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Indoor is air conditioned and table for big amount of pax available. Quite cramped and can get quite noisy indoors
4
The 12 of us came for the buffet dinner. We arrived 30 minutes before their opening time at 6.30 pm and had to wait at the open roof terrace. Most of our people focused on the seafood section which had a good spread, while I was very happy with the Briyani Chicken, whose quality is on par with that at the Islamic Restaurant. Satay was prepared on the roof terrace much later; so do not forget to try them. Overall a positive experience though it did get rather crowded that Friday evening

The Landmark is the main restaurant for Village Hotel Bugis (formerly known as Landmark Village Hotel). It served buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner; as well as ala carte menu. The Landmark is a Halal Certified Restaurant serving Western, Asian, Indian and Mediterranean cuisines. The selections of the buffet include: Salads, Pizzas, Pastas, Snacks, Cooked Dishes, Kebab, Roast Beef, Chilli Crab, Cold Seafood, Tulang Soup, Naan, Indian Dishes, Local desserts and drinks. From the extensive offerings above, the following dishes are recommended by Chubby Botak Koala and Little Devil:Tulang Soup (Mutton Bone Soup). The Tulang Soup here is definitely a must try. The broth itself is thick and robust. Lots of spices are used for this broth, but they made it perfectly balanced without the usual overpowering pepper. For tulang lovers, this will be a treat for you. Just get the straw from the drink station and slurp the marrow out from the bones. Little Devil manage to polish three of the tulang in one seating. A good hearty start to the meal here. Beef Gallatin. The Landmark version of Beef Stew with Cheese. It is thick, robust, beefy and topped with cheese for its creaminess. I always have a weak spot for beef stew and this definitely hits the spot. Chicken Kebab. A dish with Mediterranean influences. Tender and succulent chicken meat, well marinated and well constructed with the wrap. The mini bits of chicken, fresh vegetables and mayonnaise just bind the dish well. Chili Crab. The version here uses only sambal, instead of the egg sauce version such as in Jumbo Seafood. The blue swimmer crabs are cooked in sambal and it tasted fiery indeed. The crab meat is sweet combined with the fiery sambal is definitely not for the faint hearted. I only manage to finish one pincer and gave up on the second one as it was just so spicy. LD enjoyed it though. Naan and Butter Chicken. We just can't say no to a fluffy naan. Nicely executed, it was fluffy and slighly chewy at the same time. It was flavourful to the point where it can be eaten on its own or use it to dip into the butter chicken. Meanwhile, the following dishes can be improved for a better dining experience:Roast Beef Striploin. Although the beef is cooked to medium, the meat was just cold and rubbery. I think the heat lamp did not do the job and chewing on a cold roast meat is something that you won't look forward to during the dinner. Pasta. The pasta came with the option of black pepper sauce and cream sauce. I personally think they should change it to a beef bolognaise sauce or maybe use the same sauce base as beef gallatin.The verdict, The Landmark provide a good food for a reasonable price. Tulang Soup and Beef Gallatin are a definite must try. From price point, it is definitely a must try place. Cheers!

We were staying at the village hotel and hence had our breakfast here. The same was good, with ample vegetarian options available and delicious to eat
4
It has the Indian food option, which is great along with continental menu. Good facility. There is a pool besides the restaurant, which makes it more nice to spend time.
3
Came here for the first time with a big group of family and find it very average. The space between tables and chair were very tight as they obviously try to squeeze as much tables and chairs in a small space. The food/dessert/ beverage selection were very few when compared to other buffet restaurants. Quality of food is also average. But then again this is cheaper compared to the others. This place is only good if you're looking for a cheap buffet place
3
This hotel is halal friendly. Serves nice food at the buffet but not so much of a variety. Food was fine, pasta live station was disappointing. Didnt even know there was until I watched a TV advert beside me. I ask the chef about it he said wait many times though he just took in my order. Doesn't seem really happy cooking it. The cut steak was dry and hard. Indian section was good. Naan only one type. At least two types will be great
4
They have a huge spread of multi cuisine as well as Indian. The reason why I say it's nice for just once because they rarely change the options in the menu. I went here twice and the options were pretty much the same. But the spread is really huge and you will be able to take your pick
4
In Singapore, there is not a lot of choices for affordable Halal Buffet. Landmark is one of them. Although the variety isn't that much to start with given the price you pay, I personally found the food to be quite tasty. Service was good. Will come back again
3
Came for buffet lunch with my friends.I expected much more from a hotel hence was kind of disappointed.The variety was ok. Its comparable for the price. Quite a small variety.I enjoyed the pita bread, nan, coleslaw, sirloin beef and tandooru chicken. Was not impressed with the dessert section

The restaurant was located in Village Hotel Bugis by Far East Hospitality, which was formerly called The Landmark Village Hotel. The restaurant was one of the largest restaurants in the city to offer Halal-Certified International cuisine. Its menu ranged from Western, Asian to Indian and Mediterranean delights. Currently they are running a seafood promotion buffet. For a typical weekday night, I was surprised to find that the restaurant was packed with lots of customers.The first station which met us was the typical salad bar with a variety of salads and dressings. But the smell which attracted me was Sup Tulang (Malay for "bone soup"). I was met was a huge pile of bones with tender meat. Don't forget to ask for a straw to tastiest bits of marrow out from the skeletal hollows. The soup was rich and full-bodied. I could have bowls of this if there was no other delicious food around. There was none of the gamy taste that was commonly associated with mutton dishes. It was the first time for me to see this dish in a buffet, let alone a hotel restaurant.Another unique dish was Chilli Crab. Unlike the usual version which was served in a pool of gravy with egg, the version here was dry and coated in a rich thick delicious sambal paste.Next to the soup, was a bed of seafood such as mussels, cooked prawns and clams on ice. The seafood was fresh and juicy.At the Live Station, there was pasta cooked upon order with choice of tomato or cream sauce. I had the spaghetti in cream sauce which was well cooked and tasted rich and creamy.There was also a INDIAN CORNER, which offered a variety of Indian dishes as such Tandoori Chicken, Mix Dal, Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken and assorted Naans (Garlic, Plain and Butter). The butter chicken covered in a rich spicy gravy, was very tender and flavourful.Don't forget to help oneself to the BEVERAGES Corner, which was filled with soft drinks and hot drinks.Lastly there was the Dessert Corner, which offered a variety of malay style of kuehs, Gulam Jamun, Bubur Pulut HItam, Mango pudding, Tropical Fresh fruit. Interesting seeing Gulam Jamun in the buffet which usually only spotted in Indian restaurants. The kuehs were delicious and well made.We ended with a cup of Masala Chai (Spiced Milk Tea), which was another drink which I usually spotted at Indian restaurants.Overall the food was delicious especially the local dishes which were not commonly found in buffet in Singapore. The price for the buffet was quite reasonable too at $30++ per adult. It was considered quite cheap when compared to most hotel buffets

Nice family restaurant to enjoy halal food. Is not common to find a similar restaurant in Singapore with halal food and unlimited choices for buffet. A combination of Middle East, Western , Chinese, Malay and Indian food is available at this restaurant with very reasonable price. You can also check for online coupons available most of times at Groupon.sg where you can find 10-20% discount.You can enjoy having your dishes next to a beautiful pool and also from the other side you also see the Sultan mosque

The restaurant (The Landmark A Gathering Place) is a halal restaurant located on the 5th floor of the Village Hotel Bugis (formerly known as the Golden Landmark Hotel). Just take the lift from the main entrance or at the lobby and you will reach here. Turn left after exiting from the lift and you will see it!The restaurant is spacious and bright, and there are both inside and outdoor sitting. Ambience was fine and we like that background music that was played. Soothing!We came here for the lunch buffet on a weekend and the place was crowded (almost full house) with large groups of diners! We were led to the outdoor seats that is near the swimming pool and though it was quite sunny and warm out there, fortunately there are several ceiling fans and portable air coolers, so it was still quite cooling.The spread of the cuisines were mainly Indian, Mediterranean, Western, Malay dishes with some local items. On the day of our visit, some of the more "memorable and yummy" dishes include the roast beef (this dish was always very fast moving) and you could help yourself with the 3 types of sauces to go with it, nasi bryani (chicken cooked in yellow rice), curry chicken, stir-fried prawns, deep fried items that included onion rings, spring rolls, pizzas, french fries, samorsa, tandoori chicken, nann etc. There were also several Indian dishes.There was quite a large salad bar with various types of salad, coleslaw, greens and condiments. On the other side was the fresh seafood that consisted of prawns, mussels, with corn crab soup etc.Desserts were fine that included cakes and pastries, jelly with fruit cocktails, fresh cut fruits and cold (softdrinks) and hot beverages (but the infamous teh tarik was machine operated and not as fantastic as commented by previous reviewers). And there was no ice cream.Food items were replenished promptly as it was full house.It would be perfect if they could include some fried noodles or noodle soup in the menu (as some people may not like to eat rice) like mee goreng, mee rebus, mee siam etc. Also no satay (skewer grilled meat) was offered though it was stated that this dish would only be offered on weekends on its website. Although there were chefs preparing and cooking food on the spot, there wasn't really a live cooking station where you could order the food and it was cooked on the spot for you.Service was fine as our used plates were cleared regularly though we were seated outdoor as staff moved in and out and were attentive. They were polite and smiles were on their faces too.Value for money? Before we came, we had read about the mixed reviews on it, and thus did not bring with us high expectations. And my friend bought the dinning voucher from one of the online site, and so we decided to try it maybe "once and for all". However, after our dinning experience here, we felt that it was quite good and worthwhile since we were able to try out so many international dishes that we would never have the chance to have them "all under one roof"! Overall, it was a reasonably satisfactory buffet especially with the promotions on!We would not rule out the possibility of a return visit, possibly trying its dinner buffet. Finally, we would rate it a 3.5 star and since we could not give a 0.5 rating, and we felt that it was still "not ready" for a 4-star (as compare to other hotels offering buffets within the same price range), we would give it 3 star. (if they can offer more and more diverse dishes with more dessert options, no doubt it will get a 4-star

Good Buffet but it is same everyday thus 3 *.
Long stay made it very boring and thus the rating is given low.

Food was excellent.. Delicious North Indian delicacies served.. Will definitely come again. The spread of food available are just adequate & the ambiance and atmosphere is good and appealing for consumers to dine & eat at.

Went for the buffet lunch to celebrate 3 of my colleagues' promotion. The restaurant is located at the 5th floor of the Village Hotel Bugis and is rather nice and cosy. However, finding the place was a bit difficult as actually the hotel was previously known as the Golden Landmark Hotel. I lost my way there thinking that it must be a new hotel located next to Bugis Junction. Anyway, the buffet spread though quite limited were quite tasty. I like roast beef which seem to be flying off the counter the moment it was served. It took me the 4th round to get a few small pieces. Most of the other dishes were what we normally consider as main dishes and a small portion can be quite filling. Unfortunately there is no ice cream for dessert. The staff were efficient and gave a customary smile when clearing out plates. Overall dining experience is good and I don't mind going back there again for a simple buffet meal.

Was there for lunch with my family of 13. Accommodation for that pax and seated area was ok. Food was great, I guess this is managed by Far East Organisation but I do not see the motivated staff in serving or welcoming in this place. Other wise it is ok for halal seekers.I hope they have more hospitality staff make this place more wonderful place. Food wise, the chefs behind the counters are hiding and their person serving dishes could be more better. The oyster with the cheese was smelly. Not a place to revisit unless they improve

We stayed at the Landmark and ate breakfast everyday in the restaurant. It had a friendly atmosphere from the staff and the food was cooked and prepared well. There is western, chinese and malay for choice, not a huge selection but adequate for breakfast. Great start to the day

My friend and I tried to avoid street food for cleanliness reasons. Our recent stay at the Village Hotel Bugis while visiting Singapore prompted us to try this restaurant. Our first inclination was to go for an a la carte dinner. However, our waitress, Aleena, suggested the buffet since there were plenty of options to choose from. We concurred. The food was simply delicious (locals, South Indian, Mediterranean, etc.). I love their spring rolls, curry puff/samosa with sweet potato fillings and all traditional kuih the best. I agree that they have the best Tea Tarik. My American friend had her first Tea Tarik and was hooked! Compared with Zam Zam restaurant, Landmark had better Tea Tarik, in my opinion. Zam Zam didn't have the right balance/percentage of tea and milk in their Tea Tarik. The hummus at Landmark was okay, but I think the proportion of tahina and lemon juice are off - so the taste was a little bland for me. Believe it when the sign said, "spicy calamari and ayam masak lemak chili padi" - those were really spicy, so it is good to be brave, but also be careful. Give it a try

I had food poisoning eating with my family here.. We thought the food was a good spread and had nice flavour but unfortunately the quality might have been impaired due to a wedding event at the same location. The entire family had food poisoning and it is still going on for some of us. It's been 2 weeks since our visit there. It's quite terrible to go there expecting food that is at least clean but to get food poisoning instead

Value for money. I purchased the voucher through Groupon and the price I paid was almost half. Not much selection as other top-notch 5 stars hotel but food spread are reasonable considering the price i paid. They have Indian and Mediteranean food as well. Teh Tarik is the best. And we always chose the seating by the pool.

Do not eat at this reataurant if you want a glass of wine with your meal. The entire Village Bugis hotel is alcohol free and only serves halal food in the restaurant. There is nothing wrong with this but it is not advertised.
3
Only had breakfast here but there was a very limited choice for our tastes. Very quiet when we went there so maybe not so popular.
4
Food was good just wish breakfast buffet didn't get cold quickly. Other customers kept leaving the lids up which in turned made the food cold.
3
Dined twice for the Indian Buffet Which was really nice with lots of choices. Friendly and happy staff.
4
most of the times i had in this place the menu is limited for indian food and pizza which they offered was burnt and unable toeat but overall the food is ok
5
Array of food spreads was too good as it covered Indian as well as local Asian cuisine.
But the assortments were limited.
Some Staffs could be little more friendlier towards visitors.

The Staff is a little hard handed and thye spread not good, i do not know about the A-la Carte menu, but in general they are very grumpy.

Visited restaurant for gathering dinner. Was disappointed right from the start. Reached restaurant 617pm and was asked to wait outside . Allowed jn at 621pm but when taking food. Chef said not 630pm yet so cannot take the food. Food variety was super little. Desert was worse. Food quality was not good also. Especially the tasteless pasta and tandoori chicken. Next is the staff who just stamd around with no expression

This is not my first time here though i must say it is relatively new. The spread is wonderful. There's a wide variety for the salad bar . It also has sambal belachan ( hot & spicy malay sauce ) . The dishes available are japanese, indian and mediterranean . The dessert variety is also worth taking your time on. In general , the ambience is great. The chefs also comes out to the tables to sing happy birthday to the guests who are celebrating their birthday. A fun and happy place. Another restaurant to add to the HALAL list .

The website menu of this restaurant's lunch buffet is deluding because we thought we would get great vegetarian north Indian buffet. Instead, when we went there, we were surprised to see such less veg options. Moreover the breads were cold and everything tasted average. On complaining they justified that it's fasting period and thus they dont have a lavish spread. Later their manager himself admitted this one's more of like continental and not for the vegetarians. On our behest and a few animated conversations, the chef agreed to prepare us a veg pizza since we mentioned it was written on their online menu. But what would you get when the chef half-heartedly cooks up a half-baked pizza?! We were disappointed but the other asian/continental stuff might be great
