We have visited this place with my wife for a diner. They serve really tasty dishes. We ordered a set for two people and it was awesome. But be aware, that it's gigantic. :)

Good north Indian fare at this Bedok Mall restaurant is popular with Indian as wel other diners. Prompt service and take away choice.

Love the butter chicken. One of the best we have tasted, considering it is not a high end restaurant nor homemade. The biryani and curries were good. This place sees many families and elderly enjoying good company of friends. More expensive than your regular Indian stall (at the hawker centre) considering nice, clean seats and air-conditioning

We visited this place with my wife. In our opinion it is the great place to try indian food, we tried tandoori set. It was very delicious and pretty big for just 2 of us :). Prices aren't low, but still reasonable. We definitely would recommend this place for both tourists and local residents.

Food is good. Try the curry butter chicken, its good. Service is acceptable (appears to be part time staff but its OK).The place is quite packed and you might need to share seats. Set up is rather simple.My verdictFood: GoodPrice: AverageService: Above averageAmbience: Above averageI'd recommend, if you wanna try out

We had dined before at their other outlets, and decided to try this out. It was okay, though we felt the place lacked ambience (it is after all just a prata place). But in its current location in the corner, the smells of oil etc were quite strong.We ordered two egg pratas and a normal one - they were made fresh, though the normal one was on the thick side. Taste wise, it was okay and the fish curry was quite good. We also ordered a teh tarik and coffee - they were quite weak compared to what we got at the other outlets.Overall, the meal cost $9.70, which was relatively cheap for a mall. Overall, yes, it did satisfy our prata cravings that evening, but we would probably head to the other outlets if possible

Food item is priced a bit higher than those you can find outside most probably because it is located in a shopping mall. Food is average. Restaurant can get abit cramp especially during peak hours like lunch and dinner. Hard to get around. The queue can get quite long therefore a little wait before ordering. Once orders is taken, customers will be given a buzzer to notify them when the food is ready for collection

This is our go to restaurant for Roti Prata whilst in Singapore and we'll quite often dine at Prata Wala on a couple of occasions in our short time there.I'm a big fan of the Roti Prata and Garlic Naan with Butter Chicken to dip in. Of all the times we've been I've only had one prata come out that wasn't that perfect crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside that I so love.The service won't set the world on fire and it's not as cheap as some of the hawker stalls you might find but the quality in the food is definitely there and I'd say you get good bang for your buck.I don't usually enjoy the Murtabak as much as the roti or naan as it can be soggy and too rich for me but the roti and naan is as good as I've had anywhere and I'd highly recommend Prata Wala
