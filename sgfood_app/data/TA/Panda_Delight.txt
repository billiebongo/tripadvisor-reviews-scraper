Panda Delight is found inside the food court 'Foodgle hub' inside of Prince George Park Residences. I think it is mainly to be used by NUS (National University of Singapore) students, but the food is so good I just had to share this place here. My favourite dishes are 'Lemon-flavoured chicken' and 'Sweet and sour fish' - both vegeratian dishes (they serve vegetarian food only). Delicious
