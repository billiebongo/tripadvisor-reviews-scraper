I like the laid back vibes and the food and cake was awesome. The nearby farm adds some interesting memories to our visit

Good ambience. Nice to have some decent food when around this area. Nothing special to shout abt the food. Meats galore.

We had Sunday brunch here on 20th August. 8 adults, 10 children. Ordered drinks when we arrived, which took 40 minutes to get to the table. The free-flow offer is good value, but service was very slow. Then the food - the quality of the Sunday roast was ok, not brilliant, but satisfactory. However, again the service was really poor - 5 of the main courses for the adults came out, so we waited 10 mins for the rest so we could all eat together. No sign of the others....so we started our lunch. 40 minutes later the other 3 lunches were served. Either totally disorganised, or incompetent. The staff were pleasant, but again very disorganised. And it is clearly short-staffed. We won't be in a rush to return I'm afraid

Visited Tin Hill for a Sunday brunch for a birthday celebration with friends (group of 10). Nice looking place, good ambience and vibe. Orders were taken, drinks served, and the first couple of us got our food. The rest waited. And waited. Occasionally someone at our table got some food but the first plates were long gone by the time the last plates were served (and I mean, long gone). The manager did apologise and offered a discount which was a nice touch but not as nice as everyone eating together. We food was OK - the hash was rather bland. The roast beef was very rare (ordered medium rare - and arrived the same as my Friend who ordered rare). The pumpkin was over cooked, the potatoes still hard. Carrots good. Waitstaff were pleasant but when the food doesn't come together (and not even close) it really spoils the event.

Have been coming to Tin Hill Social for a while now, and the restaurant's metamorphosis from day to night is quite an eye opener. The clientele, that is. For brunch, it has seemingly become quite the attraction for young families to catch up. Get a hold of your ovaries, ladies and gentlemen. It was cuteness overload. In the evening, the crowd is on the other end of the spectrum. Quite an impressive feat to pull off, targeting two birds with one stone! The brisket burger was a scene stealer, as per usual. Tender, moist and flavourful. The burger always makes the impending end of the weekend slightly more bearable. The big breakfast was of the standard fare. The restaurant seemed slightly shorthanded, but the courteousness of the staff made up for it
3
The restaurant has good atmosphere, great for big groups. Staff were not so friendly and the food is average
4
nice ambience check. nice food check. excellent service check. easy parking yes you got it. enjoyed the desserts most. will recommen
4
Great pizzas (mushroom flavour's a must-try for mushroom & cheese lovers) accompanied with live music, what's not to luv? Deal's even better for wine lovers, as they offer wine buffet! Leave your cars at home & drink to your fill ;

How lucky are we to have a place like this. A magic combination of indoor and outdoor, undercover and open air. Set under trees, with friendly, efficient staff. The pork buns were a contemporary take on a traditional fave and the mains of pizza and grass fed steak superb. Just the fact they know to differentiate between grain and grass fed beef says this kitchen knows its stuff! Not fine dining, but food that's tasty and fast. And they have a wonderful rose at a great price, AIX. Hard week at work, easy way to ease into the weekend.

Booked a table here for Father’s Day – but the experience was quite disappointing. There was nothing special laid on to mark the occasion – aside from a game of rock, paper, scissors with the barman to win a drink or get a discount if you lost! Service was friendly but painfully slow, waited ages for my drink to arrive and had to remind the wait staff three times before it arrived. Child’s meal of fish and chips was very generous and good quality. Us adults had mains of the roast of the day and brisket sandwich. The roast pork was not bad, with a pretty good Yorkshire pudding, but my brisket sandwich consisted mostly of fat and gristle. Desserts on the menu only consist of cakes – nothing which wowed us. Service throughout was slow – so much so, that I just helped myself to extra cutlery and napkins at the service station, and had to ask for our plates to be cleared. We then proceeded outside to finish our drinks, the setting is lovely but the sofas are shabby and look like they could do with a good clean. Would not celebrate a special occasion here again because no special efforts were made to honour the day!
3
Though venue is spacious but was unlucky as the area was quite stuffy as something wrong with the aircon system. Staff did try to bring in the industrial type fans. Food can be improved quite disappointed by the standard though the portions served were generous
5
Loved the location and ambience. Food was superb...haven't had a decent steak in singapore until I tried it here thanks to an Aussie chef! Felt I was back at home in Sydney! Will definitely come back :
4
We started the evening with cocktails at the bar, a cozy little nook which could comfortably hold a party of about 10 -12 people. We were looking forward to a quiet tete-a-tete with our drinks before dinner but sadly, both drinks were highly disappointing. I had to send mine back and the Restaurant Manager gladly agreed after I asked her to taste it, and she had it replaced. The second Mojito was very much better. Not that it was lacking in enough alcohol but the combination of the cocktail left a sallow taste in the mouth.The food was a much more fulFILLing experience. The seafood stew I had was faultless. It was rich and flavourful with a generous amount of prawn, fish, mussels and squid. Hubby was happy with his pork belly which was tender and succulent and came with crackling on the side. What a bonus! The pork was sandwiched between two slices of baguette so it's a fairly substantial meal. Ambience is good for a casual meal with friends and service is above average. We will definitely be back, but next time, we'll order the beer and/or wine!

Thank you Chope for making the reservation so fuss free. We enjoyed the sweet potato fries, plain, instead of the flavoured options. The Kale salad with goat cheese was a plus! Instead of a whole butternut squash, perhaps reducing the amount and adding in other variations of greens might give it alot more texture, but that's just an opinion. Super environment and a very warm waiter who made the evening even better. This staff - Lady, could have been more welcoming as she did not smile much.
4
The service and food here is great and I have been back many times with the family and with friends. The kids love the pony rides and feeding and horses as well as playing in swing and riding their scooters in the unused road next to the restaurant.They have nice huge tables to accommodate large groups and they have ample parking.Love their pims drink.We also celebrated a birthday and they provided a cake with candles on order.
4
A pleasant date night. Staff was patient with our requests and explained the dishes in detail. We enjoyed the pork belly burger and seafood stew.However, price point was not exactly very cheap, though affordable and of good value.Will return for the food, service and ambience
2
Been a couple of years since I had been to a restaurant at this location, and I can wait another two. Menu is very limited, and of the 4 dishes we got, the pizza and a salad were the only items I would suggest taking a punt on (risotto and a seafood pasta thing were, well, not good). Service was VERY slow...and probably not the individuals thought as she tried her best, but one waitperson for the 8-10 tables outside seem a little much. As always in Singapore, lots of table with reservation signs relegating us to the rather humid outdoors that night, only to find that several had not been sat by the time we left. I do like the location and setting, but enough other choices around to keep me from going back
4
Was with here with girlfriends. Food was quite value for money with the use of the Entertainer app. Nice atmosphere for relaxing and hanging out
3
I was expecting more, maybe more is not what Tin Hill Social has. Maybe it's quiet on a Sunday evening but when I called to reserve a table, I was given the impression it would be crowded.Well it's better to be less crowded, however the food was nothing to crave about. We ordered a rib eye steak, brisket burger and pork belly just to ensure we had a wide variety.  The music on the other hand was terrible and did not suit the ambience.Service employees were probably less than enthuastic but did their job
4
Place was relatively hard to find. Otherwise very chill place good for families or dates or buddies hangout for beers. Place is seperated between dining and drinks. Food is okay.
3
We went there on a rainy morning for brunch and the place is awesome. But did not love the food there. I have had much better food at other cafe
4
Amazing place just right for a sunday lazy brunch with Kids' area, Rabbit park, horse feeding stations, situated in lush greens with both indoor n outdoor open and closed seating options.Good food ...service could be better but overall a great place.Must try for all families with young kids :
5
Chance upon this restaurant and decided to give it a try for my monthly meet up with my girlfriends. No regrets and all of us loved it.Don't be put off by the location at Turf Club Toad. It is a short 5min walk from sixth ave mrt station exit B. Food and ambience were good. Strongly recommend their seafood stew and the mussels and fries (only available on Wed and Thu specials). We had the fries changed to sweet potato fries at no charge! Also we had 2 offers - one from Groupon and the other was one for one pitcher from the Entertainer, which we clarified with one of the staff that we could utilize both. However upon check out we were told only one offer could be used. I explained myself of the confirmation with the staff and I was half expecting them not to honour. But very professionally, the staff acknowledged their error and accepted both offers without me having to insist or complain. First I was sold with the food and ambience. I was even more convinced with the friendly and customer experience after check out. Thumbs up!!!Thank you to Lidia, the restaurant manager, and the all the friendly staff. We will surely visit again.

My friend is a vegan so we requested for a vegan pasta and the kitchen offered us a Aglio Olio so yummy that we are very impressed! However the truffle fries, it's cheap at $8 but not as good. Give it a miss.Quite a great chill hide out but over price.
3
I think the food was average, but not exactly worth the bucks. I think the menu can have a better varieties.
4
Went there second time with family to celebrate my son's birthday. Their servings are very generous.. salad, pizza was great. Our favourite is the seafood bisque stew. V nice soup that goes with the bread bun. Seafood platter was a little raw for me even though the octopus was smoked. Didn't dare to eat it as it looks a little scary. Other than that the food n atmosphere is great.
4
Loved this place for its food and the ambience. Outdoor and indoor seating areas was great and we had good options for food as well. Loved the wagyu steak! It was super well done and super tasty :) The seafood stew was great with its rich and thick broth too. Loved every bit of food and the wine of the month was pretty tasty too
5
Despite it being situated at a pretty inconvenient location, the food was worth the journey to Turf City. Risotto was amazing with a strong truffle taste for truffle lovers!:)
5
the ambience was fantastic, totally great for a night out with friends. service was good, and food was pretty decent - not the best, but definitely worth going back
4
Went there for brunch with a friend for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. A little hideout away from the concrete jungle. Nice hearty portions and a lovely ambience. It wasn't too packed as it was a rainy day. Would definitely come back here again to try out the other dishes
4
Went here for a catch up during the week - there was no one else there so can't speak for the ambience normally. Standard western food menu the Cesar salad was decent service was a bit slow. They were advertising lots of great deals like Sunday brunches and live music - I didn't experience any of that but would be a nice casual location to sit with friends. Also very kid friendly
4
The quaint environment provides a great ambiance for friends and family to gather. Service was prompt and food was great. Seafood stew was a common dish on all tables - it's indeed worth the try.
4
We visited Tin Hill Social for dinner. Dishes were interesting and we enjoyed ourselves. Will consider visiting again
5
Good food in great atmosphere. Would have loved to spend more time here, sitting in the al fresco part of the restaurant. Unfortunately entertainer's cannot be used during the weekend her
3
We had forks dropping on my friend, staining her jacket. Broken wine glass on our table. Pizza was plain. Seafood stew was overwhelmed with prawn taste.
4
It was a good place to have a cosy meal with friends and family. We had lunch there and i ordered the eggs benedict. It was super good!! The egg was so runny and creamy!
4
Tin Hill Social is a great place for a family lunch with friends. We reserved the roast beef for the boys and they loved the oversize yorkshire puddings. They didn't finish the beef but the adults helped out with that. A la carte main courses were very good especially the Butcher's Secret sandwich and the BBQ Brisket burger. We opted for the free-flow wine "buffet" and the prosecco and red wine were very drinkable and most definitely free-flow.The service was a little haphazard when we first arrived but they soon sorted themselves out. This was our second visit this year and we'll certainly be back.Big plus point is that the kids can run around and explore the area whilst the adult enjoy a relaxing lunch
3
Food is very average. My Sunday roast is very disappointing. I'd rather they use the oxo cubes for the gravy than they making this very strange gravy which ruined the dish totally. It's good for family who want some lunch then pop next door for the pony rides.
4
Entertainer one for one discount cannot be used on weekends here. Nevertheless, cool alfresco dining.

I've been here once or twice before, in larger groups for birthday parties and such like, and I've been meaning to write a review but have not got around to it. So today I decided to review my experience from last night. I just saw a horrid review below and I feel compelled to call it out. I'm scratching my head wondering if this person was in the same establishment that I was, because from my perspective, the Tin Hill team got it as close to 100% right as is humanly possible. It was Valentine's Day and they put on a sumptuous 6 course sharing menu for two at an extraordinarily reasonable price of $65++ per person. Add in a free flow wine buffet for an additional $35++ and you have a 6 course meal with free flow wine, for two people, for less than $250 nett - and trust me we had a good amount of wine! You would not get such value anywhere else. You might find something similarly priced, but of the same quality and with the same ambience? Absolutely not in this town. The food was quite simply outstanding, as was the wine. I know for a fact that some restaurants were charging upwards of $250++ per person last night for an inferior product. Service wise, I saw no issues, apart from the usual little glitches that you would expect when any restaurant is fully booked and 80% of the guests arrive and order at the same time. I spent quite a few years in the industry as a senior manager and even though it was Valentine's night and my focus should have been on my wife, and even though I have been out of the industry for a few years now, my instincts led me to cast my eyes around the room and observe what was going on. I saw a delivery that I would have been proud of had it been my team back in my F & B days. In short - if you did not take your Significant Other to Tin Hill last night, you missed out. I for one will be back, and my wife described it as a "perfect evening" (phew!
1
Haphazard, disorganized and I've been here 2 hours and still haven't had my main course. Pity cos food is pretty good. Cocktails are horrid. Still sitting at waiting.... Staff have no idea who they have served and who hasn't!
4
Great spot and feels as if you are no longer in the city.Great food and beer garden! Best to go when they have a special on as bit pricy
4
Bought the voucher from groupon and I went to try out this place. Cosy and great. I went on Wednesday and it comes with Live music, what a pleasant surprise. The restaurant has nice setting. I like the place although the food is pricey. Tuesday they has one for one pizza, not sure how long will the promotion run but that looks like a good choice for revisit. sadly no live music on that day
5
Service staff were polite and attentive.Even prepared birthday cake for my wife's birthday.Good thoughtfulnes
3
Tuesdays is one for one pizza night - had the smoked salmon & magarita pizzas which were decent. Good ambience with indoor & outdoor seating.
4
Live music Tuesday, Thursday and weekends. Quiz nights on Wednesday. Simple food like pizzas and pastas - not cheap but they seem to have a lot of special offers eg it was one to one offer onpizzas on Tuesday nights. But come for the music or nice place to chill. weekend seems to have activities going on in surrounding areas like horse riding. Just a nice family place.
4
First visit, went down just to try their Wed steak and Fries special.Though there was no quiz night on the day itself, but i would say the overall experiance was still great.Fantastic staffs, food, wine and ambiance.I would return for more
4
Great place for families esp those with young kids! Casual comfortable and spacious eatery with good food. We had the really good sweet potato fries and potato fries with truffle oil. The sliders - chilli crab and beef - were juicy and delicious and washed down nicely with cold Erlinger draft beer. Eggs Benedict was done to perfection and served on a slice of hearty whole grain bread. Service was helpful and friendly.
4
Loved the mushroom risotto and seafood stew! The famous beef brisket burger was a little too fatty for my liking though. Desserts were decent too. Good place for dinne
4
Very romantic and cozy restaurant. Seafood stew was flavourful and robust!! It would have been better if cod was not overcooked. Nevertheless enjoyed the overall dining experience :
3
Duck pizza had crispy texture, baked just right. Linguine had a bit too much oil, but was worth the priceService was efficient and polite, place had wifi and nice lightingPlace is suitable for birthday celebrations or family outing

1) Requested for a table where we could "enjoy the live music". Was given a table nowhere near the music. Had to ask for a table swap. Fortunately it wasn't crowded.2) Expected to see a band for live music, there was only a lone singer on a guitar.3) Service was appalling. Servers are not attentive and we had to wave really hard or shout for attention.4) We ordered a bottle of wine together with our meal. The wine never showed up despite 3 reminders. Finally an impatient server came by and plonked a glass of wine on the table and walked off. We had to wave another server to finally get our bottle of wine. The bottle came with no glasses, we had to request for glasses. The server did not even offer to open the bottle and left. So I had to open and serve it myself.4) When ordering, we asked if the seafood platter we ordered was a big portion and was told that it was. It was miserable. And the platter of seafood consisted of mainly uncooked or semi cooked seafood which doesn't sound at all like what was described.
4
We had the beef burger and pork belly which was good. Sweet potato fries which came with the burger was nice as well. Service was ok except they were quite busy as it got later into the night so quite hard to get their attention
3
This is a new trendy eating spot that is fine for a Sunday afternoon late lunch and drinks, but bring your wallet! We hosted an informal b'day catch up for a few friends, and where shocked when the bill came fir what amounted to bottled beer, average pizzas with small amounts of filling, and a couple buckets of chips.I'd suggest it's more about being at a new trendy eatery then good value, quality, quantity meals (well pizzas anyway).I should note they do advertise music but there was none in the afternoon we arrived, which would be a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon if value isn't a primary consideration
4
Ambience is good for chill out with friends. Food a little pricey though. Staffs are friendly and food was ok.
4
We had an early dinner here on a Sunday afternoon. The location is brilliant near the former (and current) horse stables in Turf City. However, the food is very expensive during non-promotional periods - we paid nearly $100 for 2 bloody mary's, one slider, and 2 kids meals. That's a lot. With that being said - the bloody mary's are delicious. So book here during one of their many weekly specials and you'll be happy
4
I went with my family of 10 sisters-in-laws and we had a really nice time in this restaurant with rustic ambience in the quiet corner of Horse City just before Turf City. My favorites are the Seafood Stew with a mixture of crayfish, mussels, cod, clams, tiger prawn and it comes with an onion bread bun that was so delicious we ordered extra of it. The lobster bisque soup of this stew tasted just right for me I actually and 10 of us shared 2 pots of it. Other nice dishes include the pizza which I love the thin crust and generous serving of meat. The Risotto with mushroom & truffles was also very delicious. Food quality over all is above average and the ambience of the place is really nice and cosy. I would love to bring more family & friends to this place again.
2
Visited for a late Sunday lunch. We ordered a burger, the steak sandwich and baked eggs - their signature dishes we were told. Service was appalling despite the restaurant being half empty and a number of waiters milling around. Firstly it took more than 30 minutes for the food to arrive. A few times when we tried to catch someone's attention we were ignored. After the Long the wait the food was rather disappointing- the eggs were overcooked, the steak sandwich had more salad than steak and the burger was average despite being $28. The ambience is great - a shame about the food and service.
5
The premises is very large, with lots of different seating options. They have a huge air conditioned room, a separate bar with seating and several different outside areas, some under cover and some not. And the tables aren't squashed in, so it all feels very relaxing and comfortable.About the food, this is all of top quality and ranges from pizzas to 'proper' fine dining dishes.Having been there a few times, the service has always been spot on - efficient and friendly without being smarmy or intrusive.Will definitely visit again
2
We have been here a few times. The food is great, good quality, nicely presented and tasty. The service on the other hand is painful. Slow, items forgotten, food bought out at different times, two of our party had their main course for a good 10 mins before the other food arrived some of which had been forgotten off the order. Staff are not very attentive. This is a real shame because the food, setting and ambience are great.
5
Food was excellent. It's a beautiful settings. It's like sitting in a garden. Friendly staff and a good place to bring your family. Both young and old.
4
Great venue and good food value for $. We ordered 2 mains and 4 beverage for about $75. I like the ambience in the day and it was very crowded on a sat afternoon: Service can be improved though.
3
The road to Tin Hill is easily missed so watch out for it as you turn into Turf Club Road. It is a small road on the right after the Vanda junction and leads to Horse City. Ample parking available. This is a casual bistro with indoor and outdoor seating. The duck rillete croquettes, seafood stew and sliders - Chilli crab, beef and pork - are delicious.
4
Thank you for having my friends and myself over for dinner. it was a pleasant meal and all of us had a great time! Quite a pity that it was rather quiet on a Friday evening.Tin Hill Social is really a hidden gem. Perhaps now with the Zika scare going on, you might want to come out or find interesting ways tof ward off these pesty mozzies. Will be back again
5
Went there last Saturday for the first time with a couple of friends. Even I saw only a part of this location, its very relaxing and the staff is very helpful and friendly as well. This would be a perfect location for having bday-dinner and drinks with friends. Will definetely come back and recommend it to others
4
We went to Horse City to visit Riders Lodge but it was closed for renovations and when we were supposed to head for our next destination, we spotted Tin Hill Social. Being a fan of Truffles Fries, decided to do a takeaway while enjoying the decor of the restaurant itself. It is a nice place for a coffee in the afternoon as there was not many people as well.The truffles fries were decent but not flavorful enough. Will love to drop by one of these days to try the breakfast and the main dishes
4
Good food , family friendly and nice environment. Most importantly, the kids liked it. We had mac and cheese, carbonara bacon with linguine (which my girl would prefer streaky bacon). Breakfast food was good. I enjoyed my smoked salmon pizza (can't go wrong with capers and wild rockets; my favourite combo)
4
My husband and I had dinner here on Friday and had a great experience! The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere with very comfy seats and nice live music which was being played outside so didn't interfere with our conversation inside. The two servers we had were fantastic, very genuine, friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. My husband and I shared the beef brisket burger and the pulled pork pizza, both of which were delicious (loved the sweet potato fries too!), and I tried some of my friend's pork belly sangar and the pork belly was gorgeous. We also really enjoyed the octopus starter, which was cooked well and very tender, and the snickers cheesecake I had for dessert was great! We used The Entertainer and with the two free main courses our meal was excellent value for money. We'll be visiting again

First time visiting Tin Hill and really enjoyed the experience.Set in/ near HorseCity on the way up to Turf City, it’s a hidden gem in the neighbourhood. While the other dining options nearby are casual, Tin Hill offers a little more sophistication and quality, but at an obvious price increase. It’s also a welcomed find as it caters to kids and as it’s in a pedestrianised area, your kids can run freely about looking at the horses, nearby rabbit park, and just have a bit of a wander without having to keep a continual eye on them.Menu: The menu isn’t the most extensive I’ve seen and is very much meat focused with a few vegetarian options but it is decent enough. What’s nice is that every item is also given a suggested wine pairing.Ambience & Seating: we sat outside at one of the many long tables that could easily accommodate parties of 10+. There are some couches and casual dining seats as well as a smoking area with a number of tables. You do get a feeling of it being a ‘hip’ place with the music soundtrack. It’s definitely upbeat. Also, top of the list should be that there are countless fans outside, so I’d be surprised if you ever felt more than warm. They also have mosquito coil and spray if you need it.Service: service was as you’d expect. Nothing to write home about but attentive and friendly nonetheless.Food: I had the wagyu brisket burger which was fantastic. I’m guessing it was properly smoked rather than just saying it was and perhaps cooked over charcoal before being served. The only problem was, is that I wanted more – it was really very good. The kids had pasta and pizza. The pizza was very good and if their pizza was any indication, we’d try the adult size on our next visit. The pasta carbonara was too creamy but kids, I think, love that.Drinks: A decent wine and cocktail list. Draught beer offering is disappointing. They could do with adding some different beers on draught (Erdinger and Heineken) and bottles particularly as the outdoor space is so conducive to having a good few drinks. There is a separate bar we noticed on the way out which may have a better offering.Price: Dinner for four with 4 beers was $114. That’s great value but bear in mind, this was a Friday when kids eat for free when parents order a main dish.This will probably become our go-to place either as a family or with friends, particularly as it’s walking distance from home. We’re excited to have this option so nearby.A definite recommendation to couples or families

Love the cosy ambience with the old english feel yet with some modern twist to the place. The food was good and service was prompt.
2
The entertainer app doesn't apply on PH here, but it's not stated in the t and c. Its okay if the food is good, unfortunately it's otherwise. I ordered a pulled pork pizza and the wagyu burger and 2 coffee. Damage is about 80 bucks. The nicest thing from the entire meal is the sweet potato fries that comes with the burger. The pulled pork toppings is pathetic, although you guys tried to top it up with sausage and bacon. But it's supposed to be pulled pork right? Wagyu beef is decent but the burger could have some sauce in it? It's so dry... coffee was served at almost room temperature, zero service other than taking orders and bringing the bill, bearing in mind the place is not even half filled. FYI - your carrot cake is sliced way way way too thin, seriously that's not the way to cut costs
5
I had a great time at Tin Hill Social. Its location reminds me of Dempsey in a way but less the crowd. The restaurant has a laidback atmosphere and it appears to be very popular among big families/ gathering probably because it was spacious and kids-friendly. There was enough space for me to push my baby pram around the restaurant and i didn't have to worry that it would knock into anyone. We had smoked salmon pizza, Eggs Benedict with Pulled Pork, Truffle fries and two cups of latte. The food was great, i love both the pizza and eggs ben. The food portion was just nice too. When we were there, Tin Hill was celebrating its first birthday with some BBQ at the alfresco dining area. There was a special BBQ menu but unfortunately the BBQ pork wasn't ready when we wanted to place our orders. Price wise, it was average. I wouldn't say it was pricey because that's the typical price we pay for brunch elsewhere too. But since i enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, i think it's worth the price :
4
Beautiful garden setting. Patrons can choose to enjoy drinks at the external bar or outdoor patio instead of from the main dining area only. Staff are generally friendly but can be more attentive. Food is on the high end in terms of pricing but absolutely worth every penny. Gastronomic indulgence. Impressed by the first visit, I can see myself planning more visits for the future. Tin Hill left a Memorable birthday for me indeed
5
Been there frequently. Loved at first sight for the restaurant dÃ©cor, they gives the choices to sit outdoors and indoors, love the sports bar. Love the chill out vibes. Some days I dine in there is a live band singing and Sunday Brunch have some DJs playing the vibes. The place are kids friendly. Restaurants can sit about 200-300 people. Service staffs are friendly.For Brunch, loving their fresh oysters, loving their hiramasa kingfish with avocado with poached egg on sourdough toast, their Wagyu Brisket Burger and Pork Belly Sangar are home-smoked, I am not a typical fan of burger, but somehow I enjoyed this savoury mouthwatering burger. I tried their Pizza and my favourite are mushroom pizza and pancetta and egg pizza. Pizza are thin crusted and house-made too. For Dinner, we enjoyed the food - mushroom risotto, seafood stew, snapper, tomahawk, the food for dinner have wide range and if you just wants some nibbles, there are some bar snacks to choose from- sweet potato fries, mussels, and their hay-smoked pork ribs stacks. Would definitely visit the place again. Great for group events, family gathering and an ideal place to chill out with your friends from a hectic day from work. They have many promotion coming on- Tuesday 1-for-1 pizza, Wed $18++ steak and fries, Friday- Prosecco free flow and Sunday Free Flow Drink of the Day Specials
5
Tin Hill Social may be a little bit further from thee city centre, but it's certainly worth the trip. I was visiting friends and family in Singapore and we went for an evening meal. It's semi open air setting, high ceilings and live band gives it a special and unusual atmosphere. The food was delicious too, I had the pork belly sandwich for dinner - don't be put off by the word "sandwich" its actually a great meal. My friends raved about the steaks, and the dessert which is flown in from New York was glorious
5
We had a fantastic night out with good friends! The pulled pork was amazing! My Husband thoroughly enjoyed the steak and the extensive wine list! this place is definitely worth a visit
3
Been a few times for brunch or lunch. We go here largely because the kids like the pony rides and it's difficult to get into riders cafe without booking well ahead. However that's not saying the food isn't good. There are some very good dishes on the menu, pulled pork is my favourite, and I'd say the food quality has improved in recent months. It's a good place for larger groups and nice place to take your time and have a few drinks with friends as they won't be trying to get you to eat and go like lots of Singapore brunch places that have less space.

Tin hill social has a beautiful setting, there are many facilities around the area including horse riding, yoga, fitness as well as an indoor golf range called Micro Range Golf. The food is slightly over priced but i guess that is the norm these days in Singapore, where we pay for the ambience. If the food is not to your liking, pls try out the other facilities around, and come back again for a cool refreshing drink!!!

We came at 6pmThe manager saw us, decided to talk with other guests. No waiter came to serve or ask what we would like to drink. We waited 10 min being ignored. Obviously familiar guests who came after us where welcomed, got a menu and water. As they sat down we asked whether it is self service here. Very disappointing !!!!!!! There is no second chance for a first impression. We where looking for a nice alternative for our friends and us to go in the future on Sunday evenings. Definitely not this place. Location is lovely. Shame that the team is not. And there was more waiters then guests at the time we came in.

Breakfast expensive, food below average and the place is dirty! Won't be back! Sunday morning at 10 you would expect the staff to be attentive, basically need to flag down the team standing around to get service or the bill. Go elsewhere.
