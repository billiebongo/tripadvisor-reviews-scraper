With an interesting mix of menus from Chinese to Japanese and French this restaurant is set to entice you with its gastronomic cuisines as well as views that will simply mesmerised. Check out the 2 Michelin Star selections by a guest Chef

Hosted a business dinner with partners from Paris. They found the wine selection to be very impressive. We mostly stayed with the Chinese and Japanese dishes.
Overall great experience.

I am not a big fan of fusion cuisine but Me@Oue was a delightful dining experience. Excellent menu, great view of the city and good service. I would definitely consider dining here again. They also appear to have an excellent assortment of wines.
4
Decent food although servings aren't large. Service was decent but the ambience and vibe was great and worth a visit.
4
I went for the vegetarian tasting menu that has few options for each course. The food was nice, nothing out of ordinary but nice. Their pumpkin soup tasted particularly good. Will I go there again? Yes, when I have another visitor to Singapore and this place has a great view
3
The hotel offers great views of the sea with hundreds of ships passing through. The staff is very good and receptive. I had a soup which was excellent while the main course, grouper, was nice but portion was very small. My colleagues had salmon and steaks which they found good. The desserts were quite nice.All in all, I would say a good restaurant which could be even better.

We went to dinner here on our last night in Singapore at a friend’s recommendation and had a great evening. A beautiful view of the marina and skypark. The restaurant prepares their menu in japanese, chinese or french style. I had the wagyu beef sate and my husband had the lambchops. Both were excellent. The staff was attentive and courteous - one even brought me a shawl as the a/c was very cold. The only downside was the check in lady on the ground floor - no smile no greeting very impersonal so not a great first impression but the staff in the restaurant more than made up for i

Located at 19th floor of OUE Bayfront, the restaurant gives you nice view and you can feel that the place is a high class one immediately after you enter. Spacious, friendly people, everything you can expect from the top class restaurant, you will have it.But when it comes to the value for the food they serve....hmmm...I have a big question mark.As this is high class restaurant, understand they price it high but.....isn't it too high?I would not recommend this place to you unless it is special event or you can charge it with corporate card
3
Environment was good and ambience nice. A good view over to Marina Bays Sands with the water front right in front. Fantastic for tourist to get a good view across MBS
5
Absolutely amazing!!Food was awesome! Nice pairing of wine and sake from the sommelier. Service was tip-top!It was the best highlight of my 2 week trip in SG.My wife and I absolutely enjoy it!100% will return and 100% recommended for anyone who wants to spend a memorable evening with fantastic view of the SG night time skyline
5
Such a great celebration at OUE! Amazing food, drink and music! The staff was attentive and cheerful! Perfect view for the Marina Bay countdown! Amazing night
5
Great service and attention from the service team. I had the Macallan pairings and my hubby had the wine pairings. We enjoyed our food with the pairings. The beef was too rich for us but we still had a great time. The view of MBS skyline was absolutely stunning. We had a great evening date
3
Have been here for quite a few times but not after there is a change of management. The food quality has failed to make up for the lack of a view due to the rain. The HK noodle is appalling and the service is below standard. So, what is left is good ? I guess I did manage to catch up with few friends in a spacious restaurant though it came at a cost - certainly not cheap
5
It was my birthday dinner so we decided to try something new. From the moment we stepped into this resto up until we had to leave because its closing time (haha! we really enjoyed it) we really felt like we striked gold on this one.I mean I have been to several rooftop bars/restaurants but this place is nothing but superbfrom the food, the ambience and the level ofservice their staff provides is truly remarkable. The lovely lady who assisted us named Marivel was absolutely attentive and we really like how she laid out the options for us when we were deciding on which food to order. This experience would definitely make us visit this place more often as I will surely recommend this to my friends and colleagues. Cheers!
4
Dinner and everything works like clockwork! Menu was chosen before we arrived, seating was arranged, with individualise menu. We were addressed by our names as the dishes were served and explained. Each dish was a good fusion of the different cuisine, bringing out the best in the taste of each ingredient. It’s well worth the price especially with exceptional view
5
This place is suitable for you to bring your prospective clients for a good meal to clinch a good deal
5
I find often in restaurants with great views the food is typically mediocre, however this was definitely not the case at this restaurant. The squid ink brioche was beyond amazing and worth the visit alone. The lamb was probably the best we have ever eaten in our world travels and definitely worth ordering if it's available. After our delicious dinner was finished we sat outside on the patio for after dinner drinks and enjoyed the view as we toasted our concierge for recommending this restaurant
5
We had a 6 hour transit in Singapore whilst returning to Australia. Rather than hanging around the airport, the day before we found Me@oue via trip advisor, so booked for lunch.Be ready as Smart dress is essential.Upon arrival we were treated to a booth overlooking the water, marina bay sands. Amazing view.Set price menu was fantastic from Start to finish,great combination of tastes.vegatarian options were impressive. We were served by Marivel, who was conversational and knew the history of the restaurant as well as the ingredients.lovely service.The location provided a great photo opportunity and a perfect way to finish the holiday. Would recommend the effort if having more than a few hours transit
2
We unfortunately had a very bad experience with the unwelcoming attitude at the Me@OUE restaurant. Our hotel concierge booked us a table and informed us that "smart casual" dress is required. We were definitely wearing decent clothing, but my colleague was wearing designer shoes in sandal style not completing covering the feet. At the entrance he was were rudely rejected due to "not having appropriate footwear". We had to go to a nearby shop to buy new shoes – there were no alternative shoes provided by the restaurants.I had subsequently a conversation with the manager on duty. He was unable to give me a logical and rational reason why such designer shoes not covering feet completely are not allowed. The only argument was that "there are many other places in Singapore with the same policy". This sound like a child who has done something bad and argues that the other child has done the same bad thing.I also was asking why women are allowed to wear sandals and man not. The argument is that "it is common for women". There are countries with anti gender discrimination laws – in such jurisdictions allowing one sex to wear particular types of footwear and the other not would be clearly discriminating. To my question if a cross-dresser dressed as a women with sandals would be allowed to enter the restaurant I did not get a clear answer. My question why they do not - if they want to insist on such policies – have a selection of "appropriate shoes" for guest was answered "there are too many sizes". I tried to explain that with 10 pairs you could cover all sized and that I would even be ready to sponsor those shoes to the restaurant in order to allow future guests a more pleasant experience, but my suggestion was rejected.Overall a not understandable policy, discrimination of men and very bad handling of the situation by the manager on duty.On the positive side the food was good to very good, thus not excellent and the service friendly. The wine pairing was OK, but a bit irritating that one wine was replaced by sake. The restaurant would be OK, thus not superb, if just the management would have more common sense and not discriminate randomly guests based on what they wear. Therefore: overall not recommended, for the price you will find better and more welcoming places
3
Attentive yet unobtrusive service. Found the food on the degustation menu a bit hit and miss. Eel done two ways was very nice, the octopus not so much. Fellow diners were not bowled over either given the price and expectations. Wine pairing was good and interesting
3
What a wonderful experience for us thank you for the excellent service and topnotch food,,,highly recommend thisbplace to my friends and colleagues..
5
Had my wedding anniversary here on the second year. Like the environment and great service. My wife like it very much
5
Fantastic view, amazing food and brilliant service. If you're looking for a place for the special occasion, think no more...
5
Thanks for making our wedding anniversary dinner celebration a memorable one. Love the food and service :)
4
Very good food : fusion french Japanese! The terrasse is amazing and has a direct view to the Marina Bay Sands, emblematic hotel in Singapore and the Bay.
4
Was there for my birthday celebration with some girlfriends and we simply love the beautiful view.We had the lunch set and the chef was very nice to offer a complimentary beetroot soba. We had the black cod which was nice and overall lovely experience. I guess because they knew we were having a birthday celebration, they took out the price of the dessert from the set.Will definitely visit again
2
Read the menu on line and came to this small restaurant with a reservation. Food was average. Salmon was good. Beef was not right. Served with French Fries. No fish knife was provided. The cutlery was just too large and in your face.Overall I would not recommend this restaurant to fellow travellers.Bhagwa
5
My second time here. First time as a guest so this time I was hosting. The view never fails to amaze and the predinner drink on the veranda is a must do. Wine list is good to great. Need to know your way around a wine list but the sommelier is very helpful. He got very excited when I showed him my selection. Food is fabulous. Two of the group had the 6 course taster which they were able to mix and match and they loved it. Others had a selection from across the Restaurant's theme of Japanese, French and Chinese cuisine. Excellent and probably my go-to restaurant for business or high value entertaining.
3
Perfect view. food is awesome. However.. you just need 1 bad service staff to ruin your evening and you will never visit again.
5
I spent my birthday there with my 2 other friends. We were lucky to have a private table and everything was really nice from the moment i stepped in the restaurant. The food was delicious as expected, service was superb (Jojo), ambience was perfect and the view was breathtaking. Overall experience is worth a 5 star!
5
Fantastic views of the Marina Bay n the iconic marina bay sands and excellent food and service. Definitely worth repeated visits.
4
the view was excellent, but the food was lucking fantasy and was way overpriced.Service was polite and helpful.
5
More than the view and food, it's the service that tipped the experience from great to superb! Food was good, although it was pricey and the portion was quite small, our hats off to our server Thiaga for ably looking after us.
4
Nice environment and great food. View was prefect with the rooftop bar that suits me best.
Will definitely be there again.
5
We visited me@OUE for the first time, and tried out the new vegetarian tasting menu (as well as the amazing steak tartare). The seat was a comfortable booth with a clear view of Marina Bay Sands, and the tasting menu and matched wines were both very impressive. I also was impressed with the Sommelier who was friendly and happy to switch a wine where the sweetness of a late harvest just wasn't called for. The all-in was $350 - so this is more a special occasion restaurant than casual night out - but the price was completely fair in light of the experience, and represented reasonable value for money (at least in a Singapore context!). If you want a dependable choice for a birthday or anniversary - highly recommended
5
Had dinner at me@oue to celebrate my son's graduation. Service was excellent the moment we stepped in. The Chef was able to offer us alternative options to our special requests. We had high quality fusion food that met everyone's standard. Very good value. As the dinner happened to fall on one of the National Day Parade rehearsals, we were treated to a spectacular fireworks display with the restaurants commanding view of the Marina Bay. It was indeed a memorable night for us and I highly recommend the restaurant for anyone who wants to celebrate a special occasion or just a special night out
5
This was one of the best dinners I've had in a very long time. Every one of the six courses were fantastic, from the oysters, sashimi, sweet shrimp tartare with kumamoto cherry tomatoes, wagyu beef with uni sauce, and lobster with glass noodles. Also ask for the squid ink brioche to start with. It was my wife's birthday, and they surprised us with a chocolate banana cake, soft & moussey. The day we were there happened to be the rehearsals for Singapore's National Day Parade and it was a beautiful view of the fireworks & Marina Bay Sands - perhaps a place that few people know of, for now but I believe that will change. I highly recommend coming here. We will be back.
2
We went for company lunch and it was $48 for 2 course and $58.00 for 3 course. On the menu there was only 2 or 3 main course which do not require top up. So most of us went for the non-topup choice - Stir Fried Wagyu Beef and Man Bo Toufu. Seriously, nothing special and was rather boring. I can get something similar (maybe not Wagyu Beef) at the local stall for a cheap price. The crayfish soup and the black squid bread was very nice. I wish I just ordered a soup and ate the black squid bread. The portion was reasonable. So if you are a big eater, you need to ask for more bread to fill you up. If there is a mini buffet, it will be a plus point.
1
I had a reservation for 10 people at 7pm for outside seating. Due to bad weather the outdoor aread was not available. The restaurant contacted me at 6:10pm to let me know my reservation was canceled without providing an alternative. Manager mark was rude and not helpful trying harder to convince me they called at 1:50pm instead of finding indoor seating. Extremely disappointed in the response of management as I've had previous positive experience at me@oue. Management should have been professional in handling the situation. I understand that the weather is beyond the venue's control however their situation management is pathetic with terrible attitude of staff and no attempt of resolution. You've lost a great and regular customer
5
I was at ME@OUE for lunch twice in two weeks with friends and we all left completely blown away by the experience. The team led by Hot-under-40 Chef Sam was amazing, from the reception on L1 to the service, and the revamped menu. The food was exquisite, from presentation to the refine taste, nothing that said "he's trying too hard". Oh, and the view was awesome! I don't see any other restaurant around the Bayfront area that can match the complete experience. Great place to see the F1 race and fireworks. I'll be back again, and again
5
excellent service. the server made great food recommendation to us, really love the soup so much. it's an enjoyable birthday dinner!
5
A fabulous evening spent watching the colours of the skyline change; against the backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands & the ocean. The staff were very attentive & the combination of good wine & fabulous food; made the evening very special.
5
I enjoyed late night drinks at the roof top bar and found the view and venue quite enjoyable and worth visiting.
4
The view was fabulous. Food was nice too. The service staff is friendly and even help us took a few pictures. They knew we are celebrating our 10th anniversary and wishes us, a very warmth gesture indeed. Our desert is also decorated with a wishes note. thanks for the chef and staff effort.We will go back for the food and service again
1
THE EXPERIENCEI made a reservation for a celebratory meal at lunch time on a Monday at ME@OUE.While the rest of the restaurant was empty, we were seated behind an indoor and outdoor pillar, completely blocking the view. (Which is half the point of going to this venue) The staff were awkward and uncomfortable when we requested an alternative seat. They offered to move us to a table where the chairs are positioned away from the view, so we stayed where we were seated.The restaurant is dated and there is very little atmosphere about it.THE FOOD.The menu is limited despite the restaurant's positioning about combining cuisines for greater choice and the food was pathetic.We ordered the Bento box, one entre and the Eel. The food in the Bento box was at the standard of a shopping mall cafeteria with dry fish and brisket that had maybe 10% meat 90% fat making it inedible. The tempura vegetables were the only decent items, however hardly worth the money they charge for the full box.The eel was acceptable, but nothing spectacular. Plus 2 house wines and 2 beers (1 for 1 happy hour for beer only - suggesting they are catering for the professional business men in the building more so than the professional business women)Total $200. Excessively overpriced for what we got.Would not recommend to accept the online photos as fact and the positive reviews they have received recently are likely from people who have not been to another of Singapore's many 'Rooftop'/high floor dining options for a decent experience and meal to meet of exceed the expectations created by location, prestige and of course the price tag
3
Food was alright but not anything to go crazy over, especially with the price attached. View was nice to see, not nice to photograph? If you have a birthday, tell them you want to buy a cake. They will offer you a cake but it is a ridiculous price. $50++? Really?? Nice staff though.
3
Wow, what a view! What stylish interior! And, the beautiful place settings!Yet alas, though everyone smiles service is amateurish. Menus are offered before cocktails arrive. The waitress attempts to take our order before the cocktails arrive. We tell her thank you but we would like more time. She comes a second time (before the cocktails arrive) and asks if we "have any questions?". We tell her no.The cocktails arrive. The waitress reappears and asks if we are ready to order (3rd time and we haven't even sipped our drinks). I politely explain to her that when guests close their menus and look around expectantly THAT is the signal to her that guests are ready to order. The waitress retreats and is replaced.We order. The food arrives. Although the menu is concise and we have asked no questions nor given an indication that that we are unfamiliar with sophisticated food, waitress number two regurgitates the list of ingredients in each dish as it is placed on the table. The Food: The oysters on the half shell are fresh and plump and served with a delicious mignonette and edible seaweed. The foie gras terrine is deliciously rich. The soft shell crabs look gorgeous but have little flavor. Ma Po Tofu (even with the costly addition of abalone) was good but ordinary; equaled in most "Chinatowns" worldwide at one quartered the price. "Red Lobster", slathered in a chili sauce was a shipwreck, both lobster and sauce. The crab and morel risotto was flavorful and very good. The new waitress and host came by twice asking, "How is everything?" We swallowed and answered, "fine."Dessert was beautifully prepared and delicious.I wonder, who trains these children? Clearly they all have limited food and dining experience themselves, but why not teach them how to be great servers? It takes more than smiles
5
Fantastic dinner with the degustation set menu. We try a piece of everything and food is really awesome and creative. The Bordeaux red wine by the glass is a must try and pairs lovely with all dishes.
4
I've been to this restaurant for business lunch and dinner with my wife - both times I was impressed. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly without being in your face and it has a strong view over Marina Bay. For business lunch they've got a reasonably priced set lunch which is excellent quality. Executive Bento
5
Dinner with my wife which is normally not good (not because of my wife!) But because we try new restaurants and are often disappointed wishing we went to the usual haunts...Well not tonight. Took the Chef's tasting menu and was very pleasantly surprised.Starter of Tartare with Shrimp and Uni was amazing as was the Asparagus Pannacotta.2nd course chicken consomme with Ebi amazing as well as the cod with orange and slightly spicy grapefruit salad.By the way the bread was great as well.Main course too small but excellent. Duck with fois gras and beef with Japanese sweet potato and shishito. WellThat's what my wife said.....Well I think this is a. Excellent venue to bring customers and there is an excellent bar next door.Great view of MBS (Marina Bay Sands) for the non locals. Like Level 33 but lower level and lower priced. I prefer now!ENJOY
3
Nice ambient and great staff. Great view of Marina and CBD area.
But food wise still have rooms for improvement
4
The view is splendid, especially at night. The food is not bad, albeit not memorable. The ambience is too stiff. This is more for business meals (they have a huge private room too) than romantic dates.
5
In overall its really a good experience for as im its my first visiting. Expecially the female waitres trying to get to the occasiona of us to be there and gave us a suprise food with anniversary words on the plate.
4
Overall the food was above average- foie gras for the warm appetizer was very unique. The service was acceptable. You could continue having your dessert and drinks at the outdoor seats whilst appreciating the great view.
3
Food was not too bad, but after factoring the price, there was no wow factor. Would Only come back if there are promotions or diners want a variety of cuisines.
3
This is our 1st visit to ME@OUE. It's situated at the Rooftop of OUE Bayfront. Nice view that overlook the MBS. Upon seated and handed the menu, the staff started to explain some of their seasonal dishes. She also capable in answering our queries on various food items and the way of how it will be cooked and served. We selected a seasonal dish - the German white asparagus with salmon roe. It was crunchy, fresh and delicious as a starter. We ordered a Singapore style chilli - Lobster ($60) with 4 "man-tou", this is the chef signature dish but we were very disappointed. The sauce is starchy and salty but not the sweetness from the lobster. The lobster meat itself is quite tasteless if you don't eat with the sauce. May be it is a frozen meat for quite a few days. The dessert portion is small but taste quite decent. It's a restaurant that you will bring friends and visitors for an experience with less expectation in food.
5
I took my Fiancée here to celebrate her birthday, having contacted the restaurant in advance to ask if they could organise something special for us to make the evening I was really looking forward to it.The restaurant team gave us a fantastic corner table with an amazing view, our waiter was fun kind and really helpful.The food was just stunning, and worthy of at least 2 Michelin starts, stand out dishes were the tuna tartar and red lobster in chilli, and little Squid ink brioche. When deserts came they had written happy birthday for my Fiancée and they even sang for her!!A truly memorable and special evening.Thanks to all the team for making such a special evening better than expected
1
Just had a very disappointing lunch there: seafood not fresh and all items very oily. The worst was a seafood capellini: overcooked pasta with 4 pieces of seafood, of which taste was totally covered by burnt garlic and peppers and chilly. Tempura quality was worst that at any hawker center. The fruit jelly (with mandarin out of the can) taste like dish soup. The incompetence of the restaurant manager paired the poor quality of the experience. Expectation was surely higher spending 142 $ for 2 set lunch of 2 courses...I would not recommend it to anybody
5
We went for pre dinner drinks for my husband's 40th birthday. The service was great -friendly, unpretentious and efficient. I had emailed to book saying it was my husband's birthday and they surprised us with lovely dessert with candle. We would definitely come back again due to the excellent service and lovely view. Also running great drink promo, 5 steinlager pure for $25
4
The view outside the restaurant was beautiful. The food was alright. The taste was a little bit lower than my expectation. I expected the taste to be stronger than how it was. The staffs were good. They were very responsive to my e-mail and requests. In overall, it was pretty good
5
Very good restaurant, nice food and good location, will visit again. But a little bit expensive, if can have more discounts would be better
5
Food is good and view is great and most important of all, nice service staff! The ability to mix the cuisine is a plus.
5
Thumbs up to the team . . . They were attentive & gave us hot water and lemon to nurse our cold. Food was fantastic too
4
Nice environment for date. Food was good but service was better. Price is higher than average, so be prepared.
5
The service, the foods, their presentation, the scenery... every thing was perfect. The waiter was very alert and helped us to select the items. Thanks
5
Excellent service staff nice panoramic view of city Food was great Atmosphere was nice.
will come back again.
3
I paid S$55 for a bowl of Chirashi don that was subpar. Given that the restaurant focuses only on 3 types of cuisines, I expected a much more palatable dish. The cuts of sashimi were thin, flimsy and definitely not one would describe as fresh. The menu falsely advertised tuna belly was part of the dish but I was served only the cheapest parts of a tuna. I would not give this dish a second chance ever. Overall, ambience was good and service was attentive, however for the price we paid, the food needs to step up a lot more
5
This is really a place with an amazing view, where you you can seat and have drink in terrace at sunset .... or after !The restaurant propose a real European (French) and Asian menu (Chinese and Japanese) and it was really very tasty .Certainly a place that I recommend for a night in Singapore, you will not regret it for sure
5
Food was good from start till finish (even the complementary squid ink bread as it is freshly baked). The waiter was knowledgeable and patient in explaining the menu. Initially I requested for a window seat but was fully booked. But when I got to the restaurant, my family was given a window seat as another reservation was cancelled. This added to our pleasant experience dinning in ME@OUE
1
Came for drinks on 29 March at 6:30pm with my parents as I wanted to show them a nice bar on their last day in Singapore. They sat us at a poor table behind a networking event which meant we had no view (which is the point of coming to this bar). There were at least 10 empty tables next to the balcony. We asked multiple times if we could move tables but were told these better tables had supposedly "all been reserved". When we left most of these tables were still empty... I guess we were not hipster enough to be allowed a good table. My advice: don't bother coming here if you like to be valued as customer.
5
Very nice spot at the top of a building looking out over the water. Very formal service, attentive, professional and well executed. Food is good and expensive, worth the splurge occasionally.
5
We loved our evening at Me@oue. The service was excellent, the food is very tasty (try the cod on the japanese menu and the crab on the chinese one!) and on top you will have a very nice view on the bay.
5
Great view, delicious food and friendly and attentive staff. I had the Foie Gras Terrine and Wagyu Tataki Don for the 2-course set lunch, and they were perfect. Not only were they tasty, there were also ample beef slices.
4
We came here for our anniversary dinner. The staff were extremely attentive and helpful. The good was delicious.
5
Good place for business lunches, food is excellent. Quiet environment and staff are friendly & attentive. And the view is great of course
5
Wonderful place for a romantic evening, with gorgeous view out over Marina Bay. The food was excellent, although you could probably find better Japanese, French or Chinese restaurants individually (they have all three cuisines together). Service was TOP notch. Pro tip: save room for dessert!
5
This is a awesome place for drinks with friends. I have been here twice n i always enjoyed the view n the drinks. The staffs are also very attentive to our request. However, I was biten by a cockroach on 18 mar, Sat, at the outdoor corner seat facing the view of MBS and fullerton hotel n south bridge. Cleaniless needs to be taken care of. Other than that, everything are fine. Clean restroom
5
The menu is split into three so you can choose Japanese , French or Chinese , which is great for a mixed group who can't decide ! I ate from the Japanese menu and although the sushi was expensive it was really generously made and filling . All the dishes were lovely and the view and the friendly staff make this place a real treat .Desserts are also yummy especially the chocolate . It shuts sharp at 2pm at lunchtime so do make a booking to check it's open .
5
I had an event at this restaurant. Not only was the food unique and out of the world amazing, but the staff were nothing but patient and so kind. I would recommend this place to absolutely anyone who is looking to host and event, or just pop by for a meal on their own!
5
I have had organised a farewell dinner on 3 Mar 17 for a retiring colleague retiring and another 12 colleagues were invited. All of us were visiting the restaurant for the firstt time. We have nothing but good review of the restaurant:Excellent service and food. Nice view and ambience.Relative cheaper comparing with others rooftop restaurants.A few of my colleagues had already revisted the restaurant and I will definitely visit again
5
An excellent place with a fantastic view over the bay. Strongly recommended. Will vome back for pleasure.
5
The food is very good.
Its a fantastic restaurant in a Cingapura.
The restaurant manages to reconcile good food with spectacular views
The service is also impeccable.
I just got compliments to do.
5
This was a repeat visit, and we were extremely well looked after. Waitress new the menu and offered suggestions, was quick to check if we needed drinks and even offered my friends shawls who'd forgotten a cardigan!
4
Reasonably priced food with unbeatable view smack in the middle of the Marina Bay area. Not as inaccessible as some may think, with ample parking, great wines and a nice meal. Good experience overall.
4
Pro -
Excellent View
Good service
Con -
Overprice
To be honest not for everyone's Budget , food is so so , View is wonderful , for special occasion is ok
5
It was my first time to dine at Me@OUE. It was my bf birthday. I booked my appointment through their email and asked for window seat. Their staff were very kind and helpful, they gave me such a nice window seat and a small birthday cake. Highly recommend the chef beef, it was very delicious!!very nice surrounding, can see the whole MBS, if we booked our seat in outdoor even better. We ordered two glasses of cocktails, two appetizers and two main dishes(chef beef), about S$290, a bit pricy, but the food is very nice(don't forget try their black bread) such a romantic and nice place for couple!
5
At the time of writing, my wife can attest that no other upscale harbourfront restaurant offers a la carts menu selections for groups more than 7. Arrangements made via email before traveling were meticulously executed by the ME@OUE team. The wine list wax unbelievable and our choices were excellent and not outrageous in pricing. Private lift in the OUE building whisked us up to a magnificent roof top bar with unrestricted views of the City, MBS and the harbour beyond. Moving into the sumptuously decorated private dining room was a wonderful experience. Wait staff were professional, friendly and knowledgeable and helped to make it an absolutely superb evening. The menu options made it difficult to pick just one. The food was prepared and presented by our wait staff with aplomb. We took a break to watch the laser shows from MBS from our privileged vantage point. This is a real gem and would be perfect for private functions, meetings where you want to impress.
4
The outside bar for drinks before dinner has a fabulous view of the marina bay area. The food was a mixture of east and west food but very good and the service was excellent. We wanted a window table but when we were in the restaurant we were happy with a table near the window as there is a great view in the whole restaurant. Small criticism was the white wine when served was not cold enough from their chill cabinet but was fine once iced for a while. A good meal in a great location
5
We had a party of ten for a friend's birthday, we started on the roof top bar, the service was slow & some people finished their drink's before some of us had been given our's, this was the only negaive. The beautiful view's of Marina Bay Sand's was awesome, then we had the private dining room, it was amazing the food was next level, & the waiter told us about our particular choice of dishes which was a nice touch. I could not fault this venue
4
If you are looking for a good lunch venue with a great menu, good service and a great view look no further. The menu has something for everyone and the service is excellent. The views will get you to relax while you enjoy your meal. Make sure to book enjoy
5
Staff was attentive and service was excellence. Ambiance of the surrounding was stunning, overlooking the bay sands and floating platform. Definitely recommend this place for a nice quiet evening to chill-out.
5
The crab cake is a must try. Simply delicious. The French steak is a must try as well. Overall great ambience and food
5
It was a nice place and relaxing atmosphere.
Yes, the place is very stylish and very pricy, still, it is worthwhile visiting for some special opportunity.
4
Classy restaurant, nice ambiance, amazing view, beautiful alfresco drinking spot. Food is a little overpriced, probably because of the special location. Appetizers are better than main courses. Will definitely visit again.

Enjoyed an excellent dining experience at this marvelous place. Asked a Singapore friend where I should go for a great meal and Me@oue was the recommendation. Rooftop restaurant with an amazing view. Service was the best. Arrived a bit early so the wait staff seated us on the outside terrace for drinks. Then inside to order our meals. Food was superb. Choices from three different cuisines. Somewhat fusion. Ambiance was excellent. Very tall windows with view of the waterfront area's architectural gems. Attractive finishes. Open plan kitchen but not noisy. Good spacing between tables.Staff was most attentive and professional. Couldn't have served us better.Singapore has a lot of excellent place to dine and I've tried a few. This one is good for that special occasion
3
The food is good overall. The services, however, still need improvements. The staff who served us made us feel they were in a hurry to see us leave the table. When we asked for the bill, they were interestingly very slow to attend to us, i.e. they were all attending and looking elsewhere all of a sudden. It would be better if the staff could be more consistent and attentive in a more pleasant way. Also, please smile more
5
had a nice experience dining here during weekday lunch time. very nice unblocked view. the restaurant accommodated my request to get a window table. polite and good service. accommodated my request related to payment too at the end of the meal. food is delicious and at just nice temperature. highly recommended
5
This restaurant's menu is divided into 3 parts, French, Japanese and Chinese, and you can mix and match from each section. As it happened, my wife went exclusively for French while I stuck to Japanese. Both were first class in variety, quality and presentation. The Chinese seemed to be quite spicy, and while not to our taste, I have no doubt would be as good. It was the week after Chinese New Year and was relatively quiet, but nevertheless a great dining experience - certainly not cheap, but value for money

Arrived for dinner, without a reservation with guests from the US. The restaurant was fully booked, so we asked to just have a drink at the bar but were told it was closed due to rain. We asked if we could just go up and have a look at the restaurant for 5 mins to see if it was somewhere that we'd like to come for dinner the following night. The receptionist at the ground floor desk dutifully asked her manager upstairs if she could let us up to see the restaurant but the restaurant manager told her not to let us up to see the restaurant. Outrageous and completely disrespectful. Mind you there was no "private party" going on... the manager just couldn't be bothered dealing with us. It's an awful way for any business to treat customers
2
Good quality products and good presentation of the dishes, but without any flavor. We could say that it's a pretentious kitchen.A kitchen without soul and heart. Just like the service.Sorry to have wasted our last dinner in singapore on this site. But from the mistakes one learns
5
Very nice and bright for business lunch. The food and services are excellent plus ambience is nice too. We didn't do wine, so can't commend on the wine list. Nice view of the Marina.
5
Excellent food and atmosphere. The place is suitable for business lunch and easily accessable. service by the crew is flawless.
5
My favourite view in Singapore was from the balcony of this bar. The view was incredible and you can see Marina Bay Sands, as well as the rest of the bay. The drinks were nice too.
4
Very pleasant fusion restaurant with 3 cuisine, one can chose Chinese, French or Japanese dishes and therefore create an eclectic 3 course menu. The wagyu tenderloin was excellent. In full front of restaurant has a covered terrace with stunning view on the Marina Bay.
3
The view in this restaurant is beautiful. I like the prompt service too.
Food wise is average, nothing impressive.
5
The food is fab, the interior impressive, the service sublime…but sadly all of these can never compete with the sensational surroundings…what a view…its as though you're king of the Singaporean castle, overseeing the minions! You know you're in a well conceived, brilliantly designed and expertly run establishment
5
We (8 persons) booked the table in the restaurant one month before NY Eve (second seatting). The booking procedure was very easy and as per our request we got a table by the window. As a result - we had fantastic view on the Marina Bay, decorated for NY celebration! The set menu consisted from 8 delicious dishes from different cusine - French, Japanese and Chinese. On the first glance the portions were too small, but in fact we were not hungry and absolutely happy with quantity of food. The vine card was great and could meet any requirement stating from S$ 90 and up. The main entertainment of this evening was NY Firework over Marina Bay and we had a chance to see it outside from veranda. Unforgettable memories...!
5
We visited for a special birthday celebration during the week of Chinese New Year. The party of six was seated in a very pleasant circular table with views across Marina Bay to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.The service was outstanding, and the food was beautifully presented. We had 2 courses each accompanied by a bottle of champagne. We mixed courses from each of the 3 menus: French, Japanese and Chinese.It is a wonderful venue for a special celebration. Total bill was almost 900 sgd for 6 persons which is around the average mark, but we did not have any of the chef's specials which were much more expensive.A small but very rich chocolate birthday cake was provided in lieu of dessert at extra cost.Overall, a memorable experience
4
Had my farewell dinner and just loved the food and setting. The menu is in 3 parts, Japanese, French or Chinese and you can mix and match.... I had the French crab cake and the Japanese miso marinated black cod..... Wow! Also had the oysters to start and that was excellent... So fresh and tasty. The view is perfect and just adds to the atmosphere of the cuisine.... A very modern setting. Thanks for the perfect farewell.
4
We had a lovely evening for a family celebration while visiting Singapore. A highlight was the squid ink brioche...who knew such an extraordinarily shoes black bun could be so tasty. I had the lobster...large and satisfying. Good wine list with reasonable choices by the glass. Good views across the harbour with some fireworks the night we were there. Thank you for a wonderful night
5
Perfect view for the new year firework with fresh air and champagnes.
Celebrate in style with good atomosphere.
5
The food was excellent, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the view was breathtaking. I highly recommend ME@OUE.
5
Nice place to spend the dinner with view of marina bay at night splendid!! Would love to come again next time!!👍🏻👍🏻
5
Delightful setting. Magnificent views. Service commendable. We had drinks and tapas on the outside seating area. Watched Day turn into evening across the harbour. Most enjoyable.
5
The restaurant offers chinese, french and japansene cuisines, although these are limited in number. The food is very good, but the best feature is the view from the restaurant, i.e. of Marina Bay Sands, Art science Museum, etc... The service is also very good.
5
My Friend and I ordered French and Japanese dishes and we are both very satisfied with what we had. Good portion and taste, as well as presentation. Yet not overly fanciful.
4
The turkey was a huge disappointment. It was tasteless with not enough sauce. Texture was hard like a rock. I would rate the Xmas eve dinner a 4 out of 10. I've been here before having all carte n was pleased with the food. U must have changed chef since you opened
4
Overall we had an excellent evening, celebrating our wedding anniversary. Love the idea that ME@OUE has 3 varieties of foods to choose from, Chinese, Japanese and French. We love all 3 and the fact that we can mix and match starters and mains gave us an excellent meal. Every choice we made was outstanding, the service was attentive yet not intrusive and the view is just stunning. I also felt that the price point was very reasonable. We'll go back!
3
We started with cocktails on the rooftop bar. Views were great & drinks & service was good. Dinner wise- they are better off concentrating on 1 cuisine rather than 3. Food was decidedly average. Food also arrived rather delayed due to a large group that came before us
4
Brought my wife there for our 26th anniversary. Great place for such an occasion and the ambience was perfect for the occasion. Food was tasty but the servings were extremely small and insufficient. The menu prices were on the very high side and it was obvious that the big sell was the view. The staff were excellent and very professional and made us feel very welcomed and comfortable
2
Too expensive for the quality of the food. You do not have to pay so much just for the view. Difficult to find the entrance. Waiter to insistent
5
The service is excellent. The food is great and the view is extraordinary.
i will definitely go back again
5
We had dinner on new years eve. 8 courses which was excellent. Choice of wine is great. It is expensive but so is Singapore for everything.
4
The food was lovely and service was good, they let us sit for a long time u til closing to chat and finish out wine. Lovely view, definitely recommend.
4
Splendid View paired with exquisite food. Selection of Chinese, Jap and French cuisine available. Worth a repeat visit.
5
Very nice idea on being able to mix different cuisines on same menu. Lovely locations, excellent staff....
5
Must try place in Singapore if you are near the CBD area.
5 stars view
5 stars ambience
4.5 stars food
4.5 stars service
Price is also 5 stars. Worth it? Yes.

Went for Christmas Eve dinner prefixed menu. Great atmosphere, quiet surroundings, good service, food was unique, good quality but not value for money. The view was really good at night though as it oversees the marina Bay Area.
5
The staff really take care of you and make it a very special occasion. Not cheap but it is Singapore and these are once a year events.The service and the quality along with the views and the balconies makes it arguably the most romantic dining place in Singapore
5
Excellent food, views and service! The view was spectacular of MBS, the marina and the Esplanade and having been sat at a table by the window helped to keep us occupied with the beautiful dishes and equally gorgeous surroundings. Service staff by Jo Jo was excellent and it was definitely worth the reservation and wait to enjoy this restaurant
4
The restaurant over looking Marina Bay sands. The set lunch allowed you to mix and match the choices. Food is delicious and the price is value for money.
3
Restaurant was loud and food was very average. View was amazing and wished the food / restaurant experience could be better.
5
Nice to have my anniversary dinner there. Night view was gorgeous and food was good. Will definitely come back for other occasions.
5
Customer Service 5* - Excellent from ground floor cheerful customer service to wifi customised name. They also select the best spot/view of MBS (Ambience - 5*), I felt peace over 2 glasses of sweet wine.
Food/Drinks are affordable with good selection.
5
Very cozy and the foods are delicious...
Services and atmosphere wise are excellent but price are slightly expensive...
5
You must just be there to feel the beautiful atmosphere at dinner and the sunset skyline . Good and crew .. simply wonderful . Everyone enjoyed it
5
A truly fantastic place to experience the high life Singapore is so famous for. The restaurant offers a magnificent view of the Marina Bay, complimented by outstanding food from three cuisines which is guaranteed to blow your mind by its originality and taste. While a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it. Eating dinner here is a must during any visit in Singapore
4
Had a 7pm reservation with business colleagues on a Tuesday evening. The restaurant is lovely and we were seated at a table with a perfect view of the Marina Bay Sands.Extensive wine menu.There are 3 cuisines to chose from, French, Japanese and Chinese. I'm unfortunately allergic to shellfish which ruled out most of the menu for me. I ordered the Salmon, which came with creamy grits and vegetables. The salmon was very well cooked and the grits were tasty. Everyone at the table seemed satisfied with their meal. There were a few very pricey dishes that sounded great but were beyond what I would be willing to pay. Overall good dining experience, and very helpful wait staff
5
The view is really nice, with MBS in the distance. The dishes were nice - foie gras, tartare and beef rossini all prepared really well. Good choice of wines as well. It is a fancy place, supposedly the dress code is formal but there were people in shorts and sandals when we were there. The waiters are all very nice and friendly. One of the best places around the marina for a nice dinner with a view
5
First up, this was probably the best meal we have ever eaten. Many restaurants in Singapore have great views and lovely decor. Many have impressive wine lists. This wine combines these features and serves exceptional food. Starting with the accompanying bread, of which we gratefully accepted the offer of seconds, the food was faultless. Delightful small servings, with an amazing variety of choice. It is not cheap but this is one of those occasions that it was worth every cent.If we had to take friends to only one restaurant to display the best of Singapore, this would be the place. Well done to the staff and chefs
5
the menu is interesting - has chinese, european and japanese types. service was great - waiter was attentive and made great recommendations. great range of drinks as well.
4
View and ambiance was amazing. Staff are also very friendly. They did accidentally charge us for two additional beers but was quick to respond to adjustments of the bill. Would definitely come back again.
4
Excellent service by the staff and the red chilli lobster was fantastic. The view from this restaurant is one of the best in Singapore.
5
Good food, good ambience, excellent service, great outdoor chilling area after food with great view of Singapore night skyline.
5
We ordered set with top up for coffee as well as upgrade the main course.
Will be better if price include coffee/tea.
Table 25 and 40 good seat ;-)
4
Service staff were all very friendly.
When asked for recommendations, my server was spot on. The appetizer and main course was very good!
5
We were a party of 18 - our numbers and requirements kept fluctuation but Mark, the manager managed to accommodate everything for us. The view is wonderful and being able to go outside on the patio after dinner was the cherry on top. The staff rushed around and got seating sorted out for our guests when they moved outside without us asking them to do so. It truly was absolute perfection
5
The food was very good, the menu has dishes that you do not find easily in Singapore. The service was very good with many staff taking care of us. The view of course was very nice overlooking Marina Bay from another angle. Will definitely come bac
5
From the moment we (6) walked thru the door & right thru the evening we were well attended to by knowledgable & courteous table staff ....good natured & not pretentious. They knew their stuff .... menu details & food content. Requested for table with a View & we were not disappointed . In fact the best spot was a round table for 6 next to glass window....had a exclusive feel. With 3 continent menu & being able to mix & match , it was a culinary journey... not a extensive menu but it had the 'winners'. Desert menu was average & it can skipped Off course it's priced TOP-end of the scale but still competitive with similar dining venue at Marina Bay. Will return when it has its next wine pairing dinner!
5
Hi there,I was there on the 26th Oct for the Sparkling Wine Dinner. The staff there share their experience on the various wines. Although it was a full house,the staff there did not rush us to finished the dinner. overall we had a good experience there
4
View is fantastic and good combination of food choice. Staff that attended to us is friendly and knowledgeable. Food quality is fresh too, especially the beef tenderloin and the lobster!
As for price, yes, it's pricey but worth it.
4
Boasting a compelling panorama overlooking the city is a highlight for sure.
Cocktails on hand were palatable coupled with the cuisine which was conforming and gratifying!
4
Nice choise of menu of three different kitchens with a fantastic view over the bay. Friendly staff and excellent qualty food, a tad pricey though
4
As a Singapore local, ME@OUE is one of the places I take my visitors. The fantastic food and service is a great accompaniment to the fabulous view of Marina Bay.
5
If you are looking for "THE VIEW" of the Marina bay in Singapore then this is the place. You can enjoy the view of the Marina Sands hotel across while eating and drinking in this classy restaurant. It was nice to have the 3 options of eating french, japanese and chinese. We tried one menu in each cuisine with the recommendation from our very friendly waiter. We were given a nice table facing the Marina bay. It is recommended to reserve to make sure you have the table as this place can be very busy. After dinner we were able to stay at the balcony. Even though you are visiting for a drink this place is still highly recommended. I will for sure go back when I visit Singapre again
5
We enjoyed very much the two michelin star consulting chef who prepared for us an amazing meal. The view is the best in Singapore, the service is second to none, the quality of ingredients is superb. Difficult to beat such an extraordinary restaurant. I give it the highest rating.
2
The venue itself is very nice with a great view of the bay. Service was wonderful, attended to our every need and recommended a nice Australian wine. Unfortunately the food did not live up to expectations. Appetizer was too salty for our taste. The main was okay
3
Great spot , great location . The view is amazing , the restaurant is very modern with open kitchen . However , we the food is average for the price you pay . Plates are quite small . Singapore offers much better food in town. Probably a good spot for a drink , but not for the food .
4
Very nice restaurant offering 3 distinctive cuisines & menus: French, Chinese and Japanese. All dishes proposed are really tempting and it was really difficult to make a choice.Carte is not extensive which is good, you don't get lost in too extensive offer, and you're sure food is fresh.As a starter we went for artichoke salad, and foie gras - both of them very good.As a main my wife went for tartare, with just a bit of wasabi - I was convinced with the special of the day: lobster with vermicelli - in a wok - very flavoury with ginger, garlic, etc... loved it.Desert was for the chou-eclair - really yummy I was about to forget the surprising black brioche !I like very much the open cuisine so we can have a glance at all the chefs preparing our food - all under control of the Boss :)View over MBS is greatA lovely evenin
5
Me@Oue is a great restaurant which offers Japanese, French and Chinese dishes on the menu. The view is stunning, food is wonderful and service very friendly and attentive. Check out their website for prices - it's expensive but if you want somewhere for a special occasion this may be what you're looking for.
4
View was good, expectedly. Could view the whole MBS light show from a good view point. Nice alfresco area, sit around with a wine glass in hand enjoying the breeze. The food could be better though. Especially Japanese food.
5
Value for money, 3 types of cuisine under one roof with super view of skyline. Service and ambience excellent. Maybe have more choices of food would be excellent.
5
The food is delicious and ambience great. The waitress are very polite and prompt on their service. Combination of French, Japanese and chinese means you can cater for everyone needs for group gathering or eating with someone that only eat certain cuisine.
4
Great service - polite and knowledgable staff who were well-versed with the menu and food. The mains were good however, the dessert was not a good ending to the tasteful mains.
5
Had a dinner for GF's birthday, it went really well. The food was awesome and excellent service too!
3
Being able to order from different cuisine's in one place is not a new concept but this place does it decently. The view here is also very nice. Steaks and japanese are the go to.
5
The restaurant has a really good ambiance, especially being situated on the rooftop floor of the OUE building, it oversees the CBD skyline. Went in the evening and the sunset was gorgeous, accompanied with the delectable appetiser and carefully crafted main courses. In love with the three choices of cuisines as well, so whether you are a fan of Asian food or French food, there will be something for you there. The Sommelier was knowledgeable and we loved the wine he recommended. Waiters were prompt to assist and were very friendly and nice! :) We had a wonderful time celebrating birthday there and would definitely recommend the place to our friends/visit them again soon.
4
i was here with my wife for our wedding anniversary. The restaurant has a nice ambience but not imposing to the guest. This place has a beautiful view of the entire marina bay. The service staff is engaging and knowledgable with the menu. Lastly, the food itself is good. Do note they don't allow children below the age of ten
3
They do three different menus, French, Chinese and Japanese.You can pick and choose from each.My starter was nice but the main was just average.Service was the weird bit, they take the plates away from each of you the second you put down your fork, even if your fellow diner has not yet started their dish. Then when it came to ordering drinks or the bill there was no-one to be found.The portions are also very small so don't go if you are starving.I have eaten there a few times and would do so again but have low expectations.The view is great by the way
5
Service was professional and friendly. Had chosen the restaurant because there are three chefs to cover three cuisine styles; Chinese, French, Japanese. It worked far better than I had anticipated and gave the family a diverse choice with each course being perfect. We reserved a table outside for the view after the meal was over. Great way to relax at the end with a stunning view rather than rush off after meal.
5
The service crew is veryy attentive
Gave us very good recommendations about the food.
Willing to go for extra mile
5
I was there to celebrate my wedding anniversary. We had a great experience. Food was good. So luck for us able to witness the F1 practice
5
We are regular customers at ME@OUE, we opted for 3 course French options this time.
The food was excellent as always and also the wine.
5
Wonderful service. Definitely recommend the shashimi plates. The meat in the main courses is beautiful and desserts wonderful. Well recommended
4
The service at the restaurant was good. Service was fast and recommendation was good. We particularly like the recommendation for the cocktail.
The view was also great for post dinner drinks
5
Unbeatable view. Delicious food. Great drinks. Legendary service. This is my favorite venue in all of the red dot. Highly recommended.
5
Easily accessible for business CBD lunch meetings. Easy to order menu and friendly staff. Would return for more.
5
Great service! Good food & reasonably priced at such location with an awesome view! Will definitely pop by again! See you guys soon!
5
Great service from the team assigned to our table. Marivel (pardon me if i recall her name wrongly) paid a lot of attention to small details. I was expecting so she offered an additional cushion for my back at her own initiative. Also, i had no place to put my bag so she offered a bag hook too for me. Both my husband and I were very happy with how the evening went, and even though food was average, the ambience and service are a great plus
5
I've been to ME@OUE at least few times during the last year and I really like the place a lot although it's definitely not a cheap one. The restaurant has 3 chefs: Japanese, French and Chinese, so you can try the authentic dishes from these totally different cousins. It is located next to Fullerton Bay Hotel and Central Business District and had a wonderful open terrace with stunning views on Marina Bay Sands, Science and Art Museum, Marina Bay Reservoir, Esplanade. Yesterday it was the second day of Singapore night F1, so you could even enjoy to see the small part of the race from there. Service normally excellent, food very good. I would recommend this place for business, romantic and friends meetings as it suits them all.
5
Come across this Restuarant online n decided to book for my boyfriend's birthday. Wonderful night with nice restaurant with great view, excellent services and super yummy food.
4
Was a ladies night had a lovely evening w my friend.
Enjoy the great service and food was good too.
I love their appetisers!
4
I went there a couple of time and the quality of the food was really high but for me a bit pricy . Anyway was a very nice experience . Buon appetito !
1
Totally overpriced - a bottle of wine cost S$ 200 when you can get the same bottle for less than S$ 50 from reputable wine shop in Orchard Road. Ordered a Kung Pao Beef and head waiter inform this comes with a bowl of rice, but was charged S$ 5 for a bowl of rice - which is a total rip off. Would not recommend to dine here as this place is overpriced and you can get better quality food in one of the top restaurants at Marina Bay Sand
3
Restaurant needs no introduction, having had numerous reviews.Menu is carved into Japanese, French, Chinese cuisines. Each with appetisers and main course which are interchangeable.Starters was an interesting squid ink brioche with unsalted butter.Crab salad was a refreshing appetiser and rack of pork was juicy.Profitâ€™ eclair was a sweet ending.Experience would have been faultless if not for the poor ambience. Lacking in exclusivity, it feels like the dining hall of a casual family restaurant.Privacy can be had in the cocoon shaped booths but even advance reservations arent enough to secure these
5
Beautiful view, nicely spaced tables not too close and timely service, I agree everything is 5 star here for me. Meal was wonderful. Starter light and delicious, not overpowering. Special shout out beef cheek beautifully done. Dreaming yummy. Dessert beautiful too, not too big Nor too rich yummy.Just too bad I forgot to take yummy pictures of the food .. Will definitely tell my friends all about this place.
5
My first visit to this restaurant, and will not be my last. The first impression was positive with the large wine store, great view of Marina Bay and busy kitchen. Choice of Chinese, Japanese and French, and you can mix. We all enjoyed the French lamb rack. Excellent squid ink frash bread.Long and well stocked wine list
5
Unforgettable evening with spectacular views, three cuisines to choose from & excellent service. We were seated in a booth, attended to by Tiaga who was excellent & ordered four different dishes to share between the four of us. Meals were delicious and the night finished with desert coming out for our son with a candle & "Happy Birthday" on the plate. The Restaurant organised this themselves & they were happy that we were happy. You just have to go to understand how special this place is
5
We went to celebrate our anniversary.Reservation was done online, I asked for a table at the window what they considered.Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, explained us the menus and recommend drinks, starters and main.We took cocktails to drink, they have great wines but on typical Singapore price level. The cuisine is Japanese, French and Chinese. Since we have good French cuisine at home we decided to go for sushi, tuna tartare and crab as a starter. The quality of the tuna was perfect and very delicious. For the main we had chilli lobster (the chef's variation of the Singapore chilli crab) and Kung Pao Wagyu beef - all of best quality.The dessert was delicious and our waiter arranged with the kitchen that they write "Happy Anniversary" with chocolate on the plate - very appreciated surprise.Overall an experience we will not forget and we definitely will come back when we are in Singapore next time
4
Visit to this place was impromptu , one of the Friday nights around 8-8.30 pm .I was really impressed with the attendants affable service. We stuck to our drinks, and must say that their drinks Menu is very elaborate to suit all.My order was Jamaican spiced rum , attendant helped my friend choose her drink which was as per her taste ,rest of my mates were happy with their drinks too View of this place is really good, same as other place facing MBS , but this place is more comfortable. Price of this place is bit on higher side.For me it was a casual visit, but this place is fancy enough for some celebration or special date.Ambience : 4/5Service : 5/5Food : N
4
The ambience is very good and the venue is easily accessible.
Staff service is excellent. My group was taught how to have the dessert when it was served.
4
Great view of Singapore nightlight, good service and good food. Good place for business dinners and for visitors.
5
Definitely a place worth visiting. Great view, Great Food, Great Chef Jeremy Gilon. Really nice to have the Chef out to have a team picture with us. Pricing wise a little on the high side but it's definitely worth the penny. It's a must try be it locals or tourist. Will definitely pop by again.
4
The service and the food were great - we ordered the Saikyo Miso Cod and the Seabass & Bamboo Clams as mains. The squid ink dinner roll was a pleasant surprise. The ambience was quite relaxing even if the view itself is not that much different from the othe restaurants in the other area
5
you could enjoy panoramic view of whole marina bay. dinning indoor while drinking outdoor. service is very very attentive and to every details. 3 choices for the cuisine: French, Japanese for Szechuanese. We chose Szechuan food, quite delicious with just nice portion. I love the spicy seafood soup and MaPoTouFu a lot!!!! I have recommend this restaurant to my family, friends and colleagues. I will definitely come back again soon!!
2
This is very expensive and it comes with high expectations. The view doesn’t disappoint, but there are too many other problems. Menu display prices do not appear to match the bill price. Read the menu fine print to avoid bill shock. Check your bill with care. We were billed for an extra wine that we did not order. The real killer was the cafe’ style rushed service as if client turnover is the main game. Its ok to rush service if it’s a business lunch, but for the evening meal its not suitable. Our entrée was barely finished before the mains were delivered to the table. I had to scold the waiter to ensure that dessert did not follow just as rapidly after the mains. Quite simply, apart from the view, the experience didnt justify the price paid
4
The service was great and the Japanese grilled chicken i ordered was very tasty. The layout of the seats was a bit weird for us as only one person could see the beautiful view of MBS while i had the view behind me so obviously i could not have the view. It was overall a very pleasant experience. I would give it 5 stars if only both of us could share the view
4
I and my friend were looking at any restaurant we can go with minimum advanced reservation and this one happened to be available. The restaurant location, atmosphere and view were superb. But when we were trying to order wagyu beef which was one of the signature, the waitress tried to direct is to order cheaper beef. The wagyu was great though.The dessert was not up to par with the level it should be. My chocolate lava has so little lava inside
5
The ability to mix and match Japanese, French and Chinese cuisine is a big draw for me to go to ME@OUE. Their sashimi and sushi are always made with the freshest ingredient. One might think it is weird to have three different cuisines but they gel together very well. The great view of the Marina Bay is an added bonus. Service staff is great too.
4
Working in the same building makes access to this restaurant very easy. Always pleasantly surprised by the variety of selection (French, Chinese and Japanese) and the quality of the food.Their Unagi is a very generous portion and I would highly recommend it to anyone dining there.The bar area is also very relaxing although the furniture looks like it could do with either a clean or an upgrade. Other than that the view of the bay is spectacular and well worth the visit, especially in the evening
5
The ambience of the place and the service of the crew is excellent. The foods has different fusion variety and delicious, worth it. i will come back again...
4
Good atmosphere for couple and foods were above average. Rack of lamb was excellent and gf and me love it. Highly recommend to chill and have drinks at the outside area to enjoy the beautiful skyline of mbs, flyer and etc.
2
The food is too simple and not value for money. We are disappointed with the foods contents and serving. We will never go back again. I will not recommend to anyone else.
5
The view was amazing. Greeting were cordially done. We were immediately showed to our table. The service was prompt even the freshly made food was brought out in a moment's notice.
5
The ambience is fantastic and perfect for special occasions such as birthday or anniversary. My friend and I were warmly welcomed by the service team. The waiting time for food was reasonable and service was impeccable. Location is also convenient to access via train.
4
everything was very well prepared and the staffs were very friendly and hospitable. They also constantly checked on my colleagues and I to make sure that we were well taken off before our guests started coming in for the event. Thank you, it was a pleasant experience! :)
4
I love the view and ambiance of the restaurant.Also not forgetting the quality of the food and the services.We enjoy the friendly services of Jojo and his competence knowledg of menu. We were first invited by our banker for lunch and were so impressed that we came back with families for dinner.Will come back again with friends soon
5
The service was fantastic! When I made my reservation, they emailed me asking for our food preference and if I require any other service. I informed them to serve a cake to my wife as a surprise and they did a great job and I even requested seating next to the window, and they fulfilled it! Overall experience was wonderful. The view was awesome and the food was really nice. Thank you very much for making our day special

I was there to celebrate my birthday and they were nothing but attentive and accommodating. The view was incredible and the food was delicious. Though it was pretty pricy, you get what you pay for. It wasn't too crowded or noisy so you could enjoy your evening with little interruption.Would recommend

But disappointed with this place given its high ranking on TA. Went with a business friend. There is no doubt the views are great, possibly better than from Level 33 in MBFC. The service was good but a bit haphazard - being asked the same thing several times by different staff trying to be helpful. There is an outside deck and bar which is great. The food was the disappointment but maybe I was unlucky. I had a scallop starter and it was in a sort of tomato gunk that took me back to my childhood, in a bad way. It was exactly like the tomato sauce in tins of Heinz Ravioli!!. The scallop itself was also dodgy - a load of dark grey meat attached. However my friend liked his selections much more
5
Excellent food with good portion. great view not to mention with the light shows over at marina bay sands. the service staff was friendly, but could have been more formal?
5
Absolutely loved the service and quality of food they served. The cod fish was simply amazing! Not to forget, what an awesome view overseeing Marina as well.
4
The seafood was found to be very fresh and preparation of dishes were very thoughtful. Splendid wine too. And the scenic view that comes with restaurant is a major plus.

Celebrated my husband's birthday at Me@OUE. The ambience is nice and it has nice view of the Marina Bay area. Food was good and we had after dinner drinks outdoors to enjoy the breeze and the beautiful skyline.
5
Celebrated my birthday with wife and kid. The view of the Marina Bay was breathtaking at night. We choose crab salad as appetizer from the French menu - it was light and refreshing. For the mains, we had Saikyo Cod and Ohmi A5 Striploin from the Japanese Menu and Iberico Pork Rack and Mapo Toufu from the Chinese Menu. We were won over with the Ohmi as it tasted really good as it was grilled to medium perfection. We also liked the Cod which was light and infused with aroma. The pork rack was pleasantly soft and full of flavour. For desserts, we had the dark chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream
4
We celebrated my mum's birthday at ME@OUE and had a great time. The food and ambiance was great and the service staff were incredibly friendly and helpful too! The chef prepared an incredible cake (at a fee) for my mum which everyone enjoyed. I'd definitely recommend this place.
5
Had a lovely evening, dining with my wife at Me@UOB. The food was excellent, had a choice of Japanese, French and Chinese.The service staff were very friendly and professional. Ever ready to make sure that our dining experience were nothing but the best.The ambience is just about right and comfortable for a conversation over dinner.All in all, a good choice for people who appreciate nice food, good ambience and friendly services
5
The view was very nice. Service was also very good, where they greet you by name and very personalised feeling. The waiter Jo Jo was able to give good food recommendation, and does not push for more to do 'sales'. Overall experience was very good. The food were good too!
5
A small family gathering for dad's 84th birthday, challenging palate as each of the family members varies, and the mix and match of Japanese, Chinese, and french menus allow all to design their meals to their liking. Dad loves it, which is the most important point that night. loves the attentive services, the wonderful view of the bay area. all in all a great night out.
5
Good, friendly reception, fabulous views and the food (at least the Japanese and Chinese, as that's what I tried) was very good. Good bread too (with squid ink) and d'issigny butter. Cocktails looked very interesting, but didn't partake
4
Fantastic food , spoilt for choice with cuisine X 3 (French, Chinese, and Japanese) and fantastic and attentive service
2
We ordered the extra on the set menu but it seems that this was just a gimmick for the extra cost.
The noodles were overcooked and the boullabaise was not even close to what it should be.
5
The food was amazing and vert fresh, the service was impeccable and over all the ambiance was great. I booed this restaurant for a special occasion and I am glad I choose the place. Thank you for looking after us :) x
5
It was my first time dine in this stunning restaurant. The foods was delicious and worth the price. Staff are friendly and we were well taken care.
2
First thing to notice is certain staff will scoffed at you when you belong to the majority average group of customer.Food is averageView is overseeing Marina BayThat's about it for this plac
5
A nice and stylish place to spend your time with business friends or just for a candlelight dinner. Both works. The ambiance is great, the view on Marina Bay Sands is gorgeous and the most important thing is: the food is excellent!We had three courses, all cooked to perfection. Nothing to complain. You get what you expect for this reasonable price. This place can be strongly recommended
3
This place is average at best with the price that you're paying. I've been to all the nice and fine dining restaurants in Singapore, and I've heard about this place so I was expecting the same standard. Don't get me wrong, the view is absolutely gorgeous, but so are numerous places along marina bay that doesn't cost as much.The food is good but just too expensive. The restaurant atmosphere somehow doesn't feel like a high end restaurant. The light is too bright so you can't even see the view outside. I'd say it's a good place to go for a drink but definitely not for dinne
3
We had drinks here on the balcony one night. The service was fine, the view spectacular but the bar snacks were pretty ordinary. With so many other places to choose from with the view I don't think I would rush back
4
Was greeted by a lovely hostess at the lobby on the 1st floor, then escorted to the lift and was transported to the roof top. A vast selection of wines and decoration peppered the short walk (approx 20 steps) to the entrance of the restaurant and was escorted yet again to to our table. Sparkling, still or warm water was offered and menus presented without much delay. service team was knowledgeable and explained about menu (choice of Chinese, French and Japanese dishes!). Warm bread rolls were served whilst waiting for appetisers to be served and dishes did not take long to be served. Restaurant was not exactly empty nor full but had at least 25pax for lunch. We had 3 course set lunches and most of us had fish for our mains. service was excellent to be honest and food was ..... really good.  Tip: ask to be seated by the window for un unblocked view of the marina bay!
5
The restaurant is served by an exclusive elevator to the restaurant that gives an awesome view of the Marina Bay area. Service was great. I had a Business Lunch set menu which was not too bad in terms of quality, presentation and serving portion. All in all, a great place to impress your close ones, colleagues or overseas guests
5
Good choice of French, Chinese and Japanese cuisine. Friendly staff who were very attentive. View of the MBS was fantastic. Good for chilling out as well
5
Love this place, they always look after you well, the food is great and they have a stunning view over Marina Bay
5
Chinese, japanese and french menu, which you can mix if you like. Great view out of big glass windows. Friendly and informed personell. Dressing code is smart casual.
5
Although is abit high price on the food that you can get else where but the service and the enviroment is the experience you will get.
5
Amazing food, nice service, great view. Recommend the place definitely. Good for special occasions, birthday etc..
3
The food was very average and the price steep for that standard. But I guess you are paying for the view. Then again, the interior lighting was way too bright to see much. Pity.
Won't be back.
4
The food, whilst pricey, is superbly cooked and presented making it one of the better value upmarket restaurants in Singapore. The ability to choose between 3 different cuisines is unusual, particularly given that the quality of the food from each menu appears consistently exceptional. The French food was cooked perfectly and delicately flavoured. Only negative comment would be that the foie gras terrine was a little too salty, but fish and duck were superb. Service attentive but unobtrusive (as it should be). Cocktails on the terrace before hand with uninterrupted views across the harbour were pleasant and relaxing. Extensive wine list, but priced for business diners trying to impress clients, with bottles way over priced for vintage and pedigree. Often par for the course in high end Singapore restaurants, but a shame as such ridiculous mark-ups reduce value perception of the overall meal. All in all a great relaxing evening with good food and service. Would be excellent but let down by wine list strategy.

I had heard of this place a long time ago , and i had browsed the Menu on their website . I noticed that did not have Vegetarian dishes on the Menu , so i never bothered to go there. A concierge service booked the restaurant for me , and i asked if they can do Veg , which they confirmed. Still in doubt , i called the restaurant and luckily got on the line the restaurant manager , ( a European Gent , i believe ) .... sorry i forgot the name. He was very friendly and very clearly confirmed they will do Vegetarian dishes , though they dont have much on the Menu . Then he named a few dishes , which convinced me that they knew what needs to be done. We had a fantastic experience , and thanks in a great part to the European Manager (sorry again - should have written down the name ) and also Mr Thyagrajan , one of the waiting staff . Its an high end restaurant , and when i visit such a restaurant i would like to feel comfortable , happy and would expect attention to detail .Just an example , one of the servers served us squid ink bread . The manager saw this from a distance .... and without any prompting immediately walked over to the server and asked him to replace with white bread . And now comes the attention to detail , he even had the plates changed when the bread was replaced. We had requested and then he assisted us to move to a table with a view , for dessert - once the table became available Food was great , service was brilliant I will surely visit the restaurant more ofte

Nice view of Marina Bay and Sands Hotel. Food was OK but no where near exceptional, wine list is very expensive
5
This is a fusion food luxury restaurant, with 3 types of menu - Japanese, French and Chinese. Had a nice dinner with my colleagues, and we enjoyed the views. This would be a nice choice for business, as well as a nice romantic dinner with your loved ones
4
We visited with my mother for the first time last week. Great view and excellent food and service. Portions are very big!
4
Great food and beautiful views. Gluten-free options available apart from dessert. Cold inside but they provide a sholl if you ask for the temp to be turned up.
5
Great view awesome food and good service. Even the complimentary bread was mouthwatering. Three types of cruisines jap Chinese french to choose from. Portion was big for the Chinese mains we ordered. Highly recommend
5
Really is a awesome dinner experience all aroud , friendly staff along side with great chef . The server never fails to impress me there !
4
The reserbation system is nice. And menu is also good for various favor.
It has three type of cuisine and the guest choice differntly.
5
Patronized me@OUE with a group of colleagues, in celebration of a milestone achieved by one of us. It was a first time there for all of us, so it took a little exploring to find the exclusive little counter in the OUE Bayfront building, and their lift which took us right up to the restaurant.The poshness of the place was the first thing that struck us, and with full-length windows all around, the amount of natural light flooding the place felt airy and very comfortable. Once we were seated, service was also attentive and thoughtful, though our maitre d' could have been a little more smiley.The food was lovely. They were all served in pretty and dainty presentations, and they didn't just look good, they tasted good too, regardless of the cuisine ordered. After all, this is a restaurant serving all 3 cuisines -- Chinese, French and Japanese. My vichysoisse tasted awesome, and the braised duck leg cooked to near-perfectness. My colleagues, who ordered a mix of other dishes across the 3 cuisines, all gave good feedback about their food as well.I sure wouldn't mind going back there again, given the lovely ambience and wonderful view of the city
4
I had dinner with my wife. I like a lot the separation of the menu by country/style, so you have Japanese, French and Chinese cuisine, and you can combine them. We had the Kani Salad and Tako No Yawaragani, which were good. But the Main Dish Seafood Mee Sua as well as the “Kung Pao” Wagyu Beef were SUPERB! I like spicy food, so just beware. We felt the service was also very nice, and the spectacular view deserve high marks. As for the deserts, we opted for a scoop of ice cream.I would fully recommend for a nigh out with your loved one. By the way it has a smart casual dress code

This is long overdue review. The first time I heard about this restaurant and its concept made me chuckle : it was marketed as celebrity hang out place so you eat there with added bonus of brushing elbow with the stars? It doesn't sound serious at all. Went few times at night for drinks and spotted the place quite empty even on Thursday / Friday night.When I dined there few months back though it seemed like they have managed to rebrand themselves more seriously. The restaurant was busy, service was ok, food was ok. My only complained was about the huge portion and misleading information. I specifically asked advise of our server whether I should go with full portion or half portion of lobster risotto for main course considering the menu I have chosen and he insisted that half portion will be too little. To our surprise, the full portion lobster risotto was more like sharing plate for two. It was also very watery, I could manage to only eat few spoon. Dessert was the best. Nicolas, the pastry chef who is now helming pastry in Odette - came to our table to explain his creation. Dessert was definitely the star of our meal.The place it self was too bright we can't enjoy the view outside especially seating in the middle of the restaurant. I recommend people to go for lunch and drinks
4
It's our first time to have dinner at ME@OUE . It's very good for the foods and service . Different type of foods make more choices for customers.Also the view is very nice when comes to night !We would like to recommend and wish go there again
5
I really cannot find anything negative to say to this one. That was my third dinner (in as many years) and everything was great - nice table with great view, impeccable service and great food.
5
Really enjoyed the food here. (I ordered sushi moriawase followed by kung pao beef). Very friendly and efficient staff too.
4
I reallt loved that places! ME@ OUE are really amazing!
Me and my boyfriend will come back often! 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
5
The view was great. Service was awesome. And the food was excellent. Will go back again to try other menu.
5
Attentive, warmth, friendly and professional services, food has great taste of original freshness, unique combination with great care to healthy diet, nicely presented for eye pleasure before taste. Great place for corporate, family and friends for all occasions.
4
My partner and I especially love the squid ink croissant. It was very very fresh. Food was ok, not great, but it was alright.
4
We had drinks on the balcony then dinner inside. Staff used to be rude and bad service but this time seems like things have changed. Very attentionned and caring, drinks and food are really good and wine is not so expensive. Overall great experience.

I was pretty annoyed with your waiter's challenging tone when I asked him about the meaning of AP and MC on the menu. Not only that, he whispered to another waitress in front of me (thinking that I couldn't hear) that she didn't even know MC!!!! Unfortunately both my guest and I heard it.I truly feel that explaining the menu is part of the waiter's service. I requested one of the waitress, Kasy (not sure whether it's right spelling of her name) to serve my table. In fact, I found that another service staff, Da Da very impressive with her detailed description of each dish. I wondered the reason of such inconsistent standard of service.Frankly, this is my first visit on 29th March (under Rachael Cheng) to your restaurant and I am a regular of one Italian restaurant on 43th across the street. Your service staff's attitude pretty embarrassed me in front of my guest

Had our anniversary dinner at ME@OUE, had the lobster risotto and pistachio lamb rack as our main course. Lamb rack is extremely juicy. For our starter, we ordered the pan-seared Hokkaido scallop and the Szechuan crystal prawn. Hokkaido scallop is perfectly half cooked, locking in the flavor and the sweetness of the scallop. Prawn is placed on top of a century egg paste with Szechuan spicy bean paste sauce, my husband especially like the flavor.For dessert, we ordered an eclair to share, the portion is huge, the top portion of the eclair have a crunchy texture to it, very different from the typical eclair texture, with the vanilla ice cream and warm chocolate sauce topping. Its divine.The staff that serve us, provide us with really good service and even provide a lemon tart for us on the house when he knows we are here for our anniversary dinner. Not to mention also the great spot he brought us on the outdoor of the restaurant that has a best spot of the MBS hotel.We had a wonderful night at ME@OUE and we look forward to be there again
3
While the food was decent, I felt it definitely leaned heavily on the ingredients, rather than the actual dishes themselves. I felt a general lack of cohesion between the flavours.. so while it did taste ok (when is lobster, wagyu, cavier etc not going to taste good?), I felt the ingredients weren't fully taken advantage of... they could have been utilized so much better.I selected the restaurant for the location and what looked like great atmosphere, however these aspects were disappointing.. the general layout, tables, and lighting didn't leave you with much privacy.. and with 10 staff members buzzing around, I never really felt comfortable and able to focus on my meal and company.Staff were attentive, but seemed unmotivated and bored. Overall it was an ok experience, but not one I would be quick to repeat when there are so many other options
4
My friend gathered 10 of us for his engagement party, and the place did not disappoint. We were given a nice table outside, even though a little too small for 10 pax, it was still fine as a high table was added later on.The view was great and we managed to enjoy the happy hour until 8PM which was quite nice. PositivesThe viewThe Happy hourThe musicNegativesIf any, staff could have been a little more prompt but still very nice and always polite.Overall, this was a very nice evening, in company of some nice drinks and surely we will be back
5
Lovely view and awesome food. Delightful service. What more can I say? Catch the light show at 8 and 9:30
5
The food was really good, and all is perfect. Combination the sweet, salt and the ingredients really good. I'm speechless
5
Good food! Good service! Good ambience! I will recommend to my friends around. Will sure back to visit again.
3
Great View. We ordered a mix of dishes. The lamb rack was really good. the asian cod fish was average.The food was really good but not out of the world.If you want to pay for the overall ambience, then fine. but just for the food itself - its not worth it

Hi EricaWe had a most unpleasant experience last night at your restaurant. There were a few things I wanted to mention.1) The service is ok but it is WAY over the top. I think we had 30 visits from our server during the meal, barely letting us get a sip of wine in before he was back to top us off from the bottle. Our server was good (Jojo), but it was clear he has been taught in a very aggressive manner2) We were upset yet not surprised that the bottle of wine we ordered was not available. Upset because it was not available, and not surprised because it is one of very few bottles under the $1,000 price. Also, the bottle of wine we had to settle on cost SGD$23 on average yet you charge SGD$150. This markup is really egregious for that price point. Because we actually anticipated that your restaurant would attempt the typical restaurant ruse of a bait and switch tactic on the wine, we were highly suspicious when the server came to our table to take our food order without yet delivering the wine. We demanded to get the wine first, and only after then were we told it was not available. This felt to us like an attempt to get us to place an order so that we felt locked into the meal before disappointing us with the news on the unavailable wine. I am pretty sure most diners would see through your ruse, as we did, and it really casts you in a devious and low class light.3) There are etiquette problems with your service which are not specific to your restaurant but which are gravely misunderstood and rude. In your case, when a guest leaves the table, the server is very quick to pick up the napkin, fold it, and place it on the table. THIS IS BAD ETIQUETTE. I invite you to Google it and print it out for your maitre'd (if you have one) and you will quickly realize that the polite thing to do is fold it and return it to the seat of the chair. A soiled napkin should NEVER be placed on a table top.Finally, while interior design is not my forte, I would also opine that your restaurant is way too bright. What guests are paying for at your restaurant is as much about the ambiance and view as the food. With lights that are so bright, there is nothing but glare on the windows and you cannot enjoy the views of the marina and CBD. I leave this to you to decide.I hope that you will consider all of this feedback and attempt improvements. I am sorry to say that I wouldn't recommend your restaurant to anyone at all, which is unfortunate because you have so much potential given your location.Thank you for your timeKendall Johnso

I brought my mum for a birthday dinner on one Sat night. We are awed by the interior dÃ©cor that has a wide open kitchen. service is impeccable and the was mouth watering delicious. We had Chinese (3 selection of French/Jap/Chinese) and food was cooked to perfection.The night view was spectacular. We are seated facing the full view of MBS, thus, when night fall, we are rewarded with the laser light show from MBS. We had a great night and it was a memorable night for my mum
4
If you're looking for a romantic restaurant for a dinner - choose something else. The place is excellent for business meals, great menu and attentive service, the view is bonus. Special mention for risotto and cheese plate
5
Pros: Excellent service. Good food and excellent ambiance.Cons: two large business meeting tables made a lot of noise as night progressed but Mgmt. Moved us to a nice corner booth - so that was good.
4
We enjoyed a lovely evening at Me@oue. Our welcome at the ground floor reception desk was expected and efficient. On arrival at the restaurant, we were greeted and shown to our table which had a spectacular view of the bay.It was a little different to have menus for three different cuisines to choose from, so we were spoilt for choice.Between the four of us, we managed to try something from each so overall we got a good cross section of the culinary range of the three chefs.One surprise was the complimentary "black" bread rolls. Although coloured jet black with squid ink and looking more like a potential kitchen "disaster" that had been burnt to a crisp, the aroma, taste and texture of the bread was fantastic. Clever!We thought the dishes we had all were beautifully presented, made of fresh ingredients and very tasty! The service was very attentive and friendly.My only criticism was that for such stylish decor, the lamp shade above our table seemed to have a very obvious stain in the fabric - perhaps a water stain. If it was up to me, I would have that replaced. But that minor criticism did not detract from our overall experience!After dinner, we were offered a table out on the verandah which had spectacular views across the bay. Unfortunately it was a bit windy, so we did not stay long.Overall, a lovely experience.Thanks to the team
5
On an intensive business trip to Singapore we were recommended ME@OUE by local colleagues and it was a great choice ! We had lovely food and drinks and the most amazing view ! Christian (?) welcomed us warmly and chatted a while - his wife is Irish ! We hope to be back .

Good food, great view and service. Nice place to chill out with friends too. Nearby mbs and shopping mall.

Please see that I have more helpful votes than I do reviews and that I have equally positive and negative reviews across tripadvisor - I am honest. I dined here with my sister on the 2nd of March. The view is outstanding and a great plus for the restaurant. The service was over zealous from the beginning. Please, if we are enjoying a glass of wine and it is half full, don't be asking if we want the next glass poured. Similarly if I am enjoying a very nice whisky don't come and grab the glass, shake it, see that there is still some left and then ask if I would like another. I am not finished yet. It was not one waiter or waittress guilty of this, but three separate people. The view is beautiful. Let people enjoy and talk without having to be interrupted by overzealous staff hungry for a tip.We had Tuna sushi, Scallops, Endive salad, lobster, lamb and the cheese platter for dessert. It took 3 attempts to order the tuna sushi. Sushi is term which just describes the ingredient and rice - it can be different types of sushi Ngiri, Maki, Temaki etc. What is sushi on the menu is Ngiri, which is great, but surely that can be made clear? Nothing was sensational, ironically the endive salad was probably the best of all, but there was a clear worst meal which has earned this review just two stars. It was the scallops.The menu states pan seared hokkaido scallopS - I emphasise the S. We even asked the waittress if there was more than one scallop as the other entree states scallop without the plural. Yes Sir, more than one scallop. It was just one scallop swimming in a sea of foam broth. One scallop.My lamb was grossly under seasoned but cooked well. The lobster was cooked well but the sauce and gravy lacked depth but not heat. Lastly, I know that Singapore has very expensive alcohol but when I see pub class Australian wines such as 'Sticks' - which costs around $14 retail in Australia to be on the menu at $120, I am offended.To the management - please don't bother replying to this with a cut and paste reply. When you sit yourself at the high end of the market you have to hit the high notes all the time. Your current menu is misleading and the food lacking any real depth
5
Services was excellent. The service personnel definitely knew what they were doing. My portion of food was great but my husband was disappointed with the lamb dish. Trimming off some fats from the lamb would be better
4
We liked the place in most ways, good food and fun with 3 kitchens, best view in town. More fun to sit here and watch Marina Bay (Sands) than the other way around. Good service, we asked to change table which initially was hard, men then possible (it was not full) so that plus hight price made it a four and not a five
3
Very average food for the price at lunch their specials are not good value and tastes very ordinary. We had the 3 course lunch and only the appetisers were good, We had some sashimi and a beetroot salad; both of which were good but not spectacular. The duck noodles look like they came out of a food court.The restaurant has amazing views and a modern ambiance, the Long corridor leading to the restaurant from the lift lobby needs to be changed or maintained as there is a stale smell coming from it.For the price there are other places in town with better food. If you must, just be prepared for some high prices
4
Food was good, as it should be at this price level.Red wine card is extensive with many good Burgundies.Come before sunset, and enjoy the view and transformation to nightscene
4
Food is generally above average but price is on the high side. Seafood courses are good but portions are small. Presentation is nic
5
Brought my team for chinese new year lunch with lou hei in Feb 2016. Absolutely the best I had for a long time! The yusheng came with truffle, which was a nice change. My appetizer was croquette, main course was beef cheek (melts in my mouth) and dessert raspberry tart. The beautiful view was a bonus for us. Will bring my husband here soon for our date night, am sure it's very romantic at night
5
Didn't know what to expect but was not disappointed. Floor 19 and so high above the city. Drinks were pricey but staff SO great when the rain started and moved us all under the overhang - disabled visitor, wheelchair and a gang of guys!! Had a great time and the view of the Bay and the light show was amazing
5
The ambience and food is equally good! Great place to catch up with friends! I informed that I'm vegetarian when making reservation and they make special accommodation for everything without having to ask. Thank you!
5
Me@Oue offers great dining accompanied with spectacular view. Offering Chinese, French and Japanese cuisine, there was something for everybody.
5
The staff were attentive and food was really good especially the SAIKYO COD fish. Really was 'SAIKYO' We had our anniversary there and they prepared desert for us specially for us. Really appreciate their thoughtfulness
4
The food was amazing. Service was very good too. We went for the Valentine's set meal and it was superb! Just the cocktails were heaps too bitter for our liking
4
Food is alright. The cocktail are ok. Service is good. Requested for a view of the city but got the view of the pillar instead, what a grand way to spend the anniversary.
4
We had a very good dinner. It was not as romantic as I was expecting because room is big and kitchen is in the middle. Staff very nice. Beautiful view on marina bay.
4
Very centre location, fantastic view of Marina Bay on the balcony outside. Worthy of a visit, but for the view only. Upside, Lobster Risotto is superb, nicely cooked and flavoured, with good pieces of lobster. Service is not bad, but just as another reviewer said, everything is a bit too fast ( I guess in such a big restaurant there could hardly be better ways)The Foie gras is not the fresh, pan fried one but rather like the paste from cans. Apple puree tastes like baby receipt apple jam but not self made either.Beef of beef tartare is fresh, but a bit over seasoned with Japanese Soya sauce. It covers the original taste of the beed.Lamb shack should be a nice one but it is a bit cold when served, so the pleasant fragrance of cooked lamb has almost vanished.The desserts are okay.A bit overpriced if you are going for good food only. It is quite fair if you also like the view. Generally not a bad experience.DO remember to ask for seats near balcony when making your reservation
5
You will struggle to find a better lunchtime venue with a view to match and food so beautifully prepared and presented
4
My wife and I ventured here on a night off from the kids during a recent trip to SG. Food is good but some dishes are expensive and a teeny bit try hard. The service is way too punctual. Maybe their definition of good service is swift service but you wouldn't catch that happening in Locanda Locatelli. Oh by the way if you want the view go for a drink before or after on the terrace.
5
Ordered French signature for 2. Very large portion surprised me. First time in Singapore that 2 persons couldn't finish a set designed for 2. Roughly 1kg beef, almost equivalent to 3-4 portion steaks. Should be good for 3-4 people. Good taste, very good services, will definitely visit again.
5
Enjoyed the ambience. Food was good. Service was excellent. Definitely will return again. Had the roast pork amd was amazed by how it being prepared and the taste was over the heaven!!
4
Service was warm and friendlyThe maguro tatare, foie gras terrine, iberico pork rack, miso cod and duck breast were awesome! We felt like the lobster risotto, lamb rack and steak were nothing to rave about.The cocktails here are one of a kind indeed (I mean choose carefully. They are all unique and from what we've tasted it's probably a love hate relationship) Common items like mojitos and martinis are nowhere to be found in the menu although I'm sure the Bartender could whip it up
5
Another of Singapore's hidden gems. Perfect spot for the view of MBS and surrounding area. No rush to the table as we all enjoyed a relaxed drink before dinner. Great service and delicious food from starters through to the shared desserts we chose. They had run out of our first choice of wine, annoyingly. Unexpected given the size of the wine collection one walks past to get in!! Bit $, but worth it. Would be great as a date venue, entertaining for business or as friends. Lacking a little in atmosphere for my liking, but compensated for this in other aspects.
2
We visited as a couple for dinner. The service was excellent from reservations to host to servers. The food was sadly rather disappointing and rather overpriced.
3
Fantastic location. Food was good but it didn't have the oomph. Simple things was overlooked. I can only comment on my choice, which was the claypot seafood. Was good but it didn't stand out, Crystal Jade type quality. Chilies on the side? No. Had to ask and never served.
5
We came here to celebrate my colleague's birthday and had a lovely table by the window, looking out on Marina Bay Sands. After the meal we arranged to be sat outside to watch the laser show while having dessert. The service was good (as to be expected), food fresh and tasty. Would definitely come back here

I did not get to dine at me@oue as i was only informed on the day itself that my reservstion was cancelled by the restaurant due to renovation despite advanced booking weeks ago for the birthday celebration. I was disappointed because of the late notice and no help for alternative. Luckily I found Catalunya and had an unexpectedly wonderful evening.
5
it rained during one of my visit there and the waiters immediately arranged a table for us inside the restaurant. they also changed a new plate of fries for us as they were wet by the rain. the waiter was very attentive to our needs, great service
4
We were given a lovely booth overlooking Marina Bay, it is simply a stunning view. By Singapore standards the service was very good. Food was tasty, very well presented and imaginative. After our meal we stepped outside and had a drink in the lovely breeze.While expensive it was not exorbitantly so.All in all we will be back
4
You may want to come because of the view and the exclusive location on Marina Bay... and you would be right. But the real reason to stop-by is obviously the great dishes and excellent cuisine. A mix of Asia and West. We've also appreciated the quality of the service. Would the air conditioning be adjusted to a warmer temperature and the overall experience would have been perfect!
3
The food was food but not always tasty!We had in appetizer a tartare (Japanese menu) which was really fresh and good and tiger prawns but it was more like a soup and not tasty for us!The main meal was a lam well cooked and really good ( French menu) but we had crystal prawn ( cold dish) and really spicy and okSuperb view but it's freezing inside
4
This restaurant boasts a fantastic view of the marina bay area and has a very cosy ambience. Food is also good and has good customer service.
5
Drinks at the pavillion are reasonable priced during happy hours. Views of the city skyline were quite specracular.
5
Was there for a birthday celebration, just two couples. They gave us one of the round booth seats which was very cosy. We shared three mains and 3 starters which was just right. For mains we had beef tartar, pork belly and a grilled fish. Food was lovely but what really set the place apart was the service. Solid gold all the way through. After dinner they brought us outside and gave us a private sofa to enjoy the MBS laser show. Certainly not cheap but great experience for the money
5
Dinner at ME@OUE was the highlight of our weekend in Singapore. The restaurant essentially offers 3 menus--Japanese, French and Chinese. But there is no restrictions to stay within a particular cuisine as each diner is permitted choose items off of each menu. The service was professional, the presentation artistic and the food excellent.One can't really see out of the windows during the meal due to reflection but our server offered to bring us dessert out on the patio. What a treat to enjoy the Marina Bay fountains/light/laser show across the bay. We'll definitely return on our next trip
5
Me and my girlfriends dined at Me@OUE on a saturday night. We totally loved the service and experience.They customised the menu for my Vegetarian friends and the food portion size is quite good and can be easily shared. They have a great wine collection and can offer the best views in Singapore of MBS and Lotus.After our dinner, the drinks and dessert were served in open to enjoy the best views while sipping your wine.Service was excellent, best I experienced in Singapore so far..very amiable staff, and each and every staff was well trained on their food and drinks offer and could easily explain and recommend to our taste.I would definitely go there again!
5
Wish we had tried more dishes but because we order the beef which was too big a portion for two! Worth consider ordering smaller portion dishes during your visit! It was a great place overal
4
The food was very good especially the jelly fish and mopo toufu. Great service. However the table was close to a bright side lamp and we were not able to enjoy the view of the Bay through the glass which was disappointing.
5
service was great! food was yummy. my boyfriend had an amazing time! view was awesome too! the waitresses and waiters were readily available he pretty much has all the attention. the whole experience made him really happy. thank you once again. :) will definitely recommend this place to my friends
4
The menu is 3 distinct menu that you can mix and match (starters through to mains) - being French, Japanese and Chinese. I had a Japanese starter and Chinese Wagu steak main that was divine. Lovely desserts, cheese if you want. We shared the Mille Fielle that was satisfied the sugar craving, but not too heavy. Cocktails were well made and a great wine list. The service was attentive, not too formal and not in your face. It didn't feel like we waited for anything, yet we didn't feel rushed. The restaurant space on top of the OUE tower is fantastic. High ceilings/windows. Every table gets a view even if your not against the window. An outdoor bar/space as well. The views of the Marina/Bay Sands/Artscience museum are fantastic. We were there for dinner and got a great view of the nightly light show across the bay. Price not too bad for a world city. A bit special - but not going to bust the bank
4
The food was great, very nice atmosphere in the restaurant, very attentive waiters and the view on the Marina bay is splendi
5
Very good restaurant, elegant decoration and amazing view over Marina Bay Sands. Good service. I recommand this restaurant to food lovers and people who seek quiet and exclusive place.
5
Very friendly and efficient staff. Had our dinner in the dining hall and requested for having our desserts at the balcony. Everything was arranged swiftly and we had a wonderful night in ME@OUE!
5
Nice ambience and great food-French, Japanese and Chinese....all in one restaurant...brilliant!
Service excellent, especially the Restaurant Manager.
5
Excellent food, best view in Singapore over the Marina Bay, drinks on the terrace before dinner, trendy and style decor. Me@OUE is as good as it gets in Singapore!
3
Great view from the restaurant.
Staff was really friendly and sweet.
Thanks for the surprise birthday cake.
Food was okay.
Overall a nice experience.
Would like to try your bar next time.
:):):)
5
celebrated our anniversary at the restaurant and this was our first visit there. the staff was very attentive from the moment we stepped into the restaurant up till we left. the food was delicious as well. we had the pork belly from the Japanese menu and the duck breast from the French menu. we highly recommend visitors to try the duck breast. overall, we had an amazing night and will definitely be returning to the place and recommending our friends there. :
5
I went there for Nee Year Eve. Normally I always hate this dinner and find the food and service poor on that day. This time I must say I was happily surprised with a very efficient and friendly service and great good. I highly recommend the place
5
Great atmosphere and spectacular view in the evening. Service was great...food were fantastic...nice outing for a date..
3
Excellent view at this restaurant! Ambience was relaxed. Good lighting on the tables. Service was quick and efficient. Our server was attentive and always around to get us what we wanted. Time taken for food to arrive was just nice. On the other hand, food was average. Duck was bit too tough. Udon noodle was too salty. Codfish chinese style was excellent though. Scallops as appetizer were brilliant. The texture was spot on! All in all, it was a good visit ! My family and I had a good time there.
5
A venue with a superb view and excellent service. The food was satisfactory, although a little "nouvelle cuisine" and pricey at $200 for a couple with only one beer each. The wine list was very expensive by European standards
3
Some items on menu were not available so that was disappointing but other than that it was a pleasant experience. Ambiance is lovely
3
Was there for dinner for 7 persons on 11 Dec 2015.The ambience is great I must say and the view is stunning in the evening.The service is super from the start. The concierge noticed we were 1 guest short when we "checked in".We were then guided to our table and service staff attended to us quickly and were always nearby ready to serve us.Food wise, we did not find it that great contrary to the impression we had from the menu.We ordered Japanese and Chinese food together with 2 bottles of Melbec red wine. [We did not order from the French menu].On the scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best our ratings are:Sashimi for 5 : 7.5Braised Cod :7.5Kung Pao Beef: 5.0 [too salty]Unagi Kabayaki : 5.0 [blend]Buta Katarosu : 6.0 [normal]Red Lobster : 3.5 [fail]I had the red lobster and was totally disappointed. The meat was soggy not firm and the chilli sauce did not taste like chilli sauce.Red wine : 6.5.I was a bit confused about the red wine. The staff who recommended tasted it after opening but yet asked me if I wanted to taste it. [I originally ordered a Spanish red wine but was told out of stock]
4
First impression of the restaurant is rather decent. As I was attending a private event, whereby the entire restaurant was booked for the entire night, I was not able to see the typical layout of tables and seatings.The finger foods are excellent, especially the beef and fish. Very fresh and the beef cubes, superbly tenderized.Has a great view of the bayfront area, overlooking the floating platform, Marina Bay Sands and The Esplanade
4
Been there with my gf on our 1st anniversary. Although the price is in the steep side but the ambience, service quality is top notched
5
Very Impressed with the service. Service staff were very friendly and prompt. Would highly recommend this restaurant
5
This was our favourite dinner whilst in Singapore.The welcome or rather lack of welcome from the girl on the check in desk on the ground floor is the only negative about this place. All the rest of the staff were friendly and the menu is to die for. There are 3 menus - French, Japanese and International (I think) and you can mix and match across the three menus. You can see the chefs in the open kitchens preparing and cooking the food. Other people have commented on the small portions but we didn't find that. My cod dish was more than enough and my husband who has a good appetite felt there was more than enough food for him too. He had a beef dish. After dinner we wanted to go out on to the rooftop terrace for a drink and our waiter got a table set up for us whilst we were finishing in the restaurant and then took us out and made sure we were happy with the table which was a nice touch.All in all I think this is a great place, yes it's a bit expensive, but with everything in life you get what you pay for and this was definitely worth every Singapore Dollar we spent! A real Wow Wow Wow evening. Thanks to all the hardworking staff that make this restaurant what it is
5
Hello Management and staff,Just want to say that myself and my wife had an enjoyable time there. The staff especially the waitering staff did everything they could to make us feel comfortable and familiarise us with the dishes we could choose.Special mention goes to Mr Jojo, for his patience and professionalism. Also, for giving us advice to make a decision on what to select and anticipate.SincerelyMr & Mrs Ke
4
Amazing service, good food, rate as very good instead excellent because of dessert that was a bit too cook to my taste. I ll recommend anyway!
3
Very pleasant reception. Food fairly average. Wine prices extortionate. Overall experience rather mediocre. Staff solicitous and not too intrusive or familiar
4
Reasonable pricing overall. Did not try french food, but the combination of Chinese and Japanese food was great. Crystal prawn and lobster soup were great in look and taste, do recommend it if you like Asian food. The grilled cod fish was average though. In overall, a restaurant brilliant view and even better food.
4
Delicious food, beautifully presented, great view. Experience marred somewhat by being asked by our very friendly servers whether we were enjoying the food seemingly every couple of minutes. Also one of the servers tried to remove my empty plate before my Wife has finished the course - which is one of my pet hates.
4
The good side of this restaurant: Excellent service, great variety of specialized food, superb ambiance.It's also good to know - It's expensive and the food quantity is small.My opinion: Good for business meals and maybe to impress our partners once :)
5
Beautiful location of the restaurant with a stunning view. Have a drink on the terrace first. Highly recommended for a romantic dinner. Expensive but like everything else in Singapore. Lobster risotto is the most delicious plate, don't miss it
5
Great food, great views from cool hangout. Nice variety of food and highly interesting cocktail and wine list. Well worth a try
4
The food was very well thought through, pretty to look at but more importantly, the food was very very good. . My friend and I decided to try one set of the Japenese and I took the French menu, We also had interesting beer from Japan. The Nipponia and Hitachino beers were yummy. We were digging at each other's plate cos the food was delicious.
3
Environment was alright. I was promised a window seat but when I reached there, they told me it was subjected to availability and all window seats were taken. And after some fussing, they managed to give me the window seat. Not so good experience as it was for a birthday celebration and I had to be upset at the beginning of the dinner.
5
Great Service, interesting concept, delicious food, beautiful view.This place deserves great reviews
4
There are 2 things that stand out from dining at Me@OUE - the service and the view. You just can't top either of these, and if you are there in the evening you can step out and watch the light and laser show on the bay.The wine list is also very extensive, albeit pricey. But let's be honest, you are paying for the view and service.The food is a great as well, allowing for a rather unique selection of each course from one of three types of cuisine - French, Chinese or Japanese. This allows you to bounce between regions within one meal, and all at the same restaurant. While the portion sizes are European, you won't go away hungry.This would be a great venue for that special occasion
5
Excellent views. Good food and seamless service. Great ambience. Recommended for special occasions. Enjoyed to the baby sumo cocktail.
5
they took special attention for us, it was very niceview on the marina bay not bad although the glass reflects the vie
4
Food and service was great, would recommend going to Singapore and looking for a nice view with food
5
Spent a perfect evening outside in their lounge. Tapas and wine are delicious. View over the bay is fantastic. Couldn't have been better for a chilling evening.
5
I was wonderfully impressed with the overall service of the Me@oue restaurant from the moment we walked in on a monday evening. The receptionist took care of us exceptionally well. The waiters who took our orders for drinks out in the veranda all the way till dinner and dessert, served us extraordinarily well. Although it is not fine dining but in my impression, it is close to it . The fine fusion of the 3 types of cusine from french to chinese to japanese really blends in exceptionally well
4
Attended a function here with 140 others. The food was very good the lamb, chicken, fish, the bean curd and desserts were very good. Also enjoyed the desserts on offer. The wine available was very good. The views are stunning, good photo opportunity
3
Went there for our first date - place is nice, view is good but food portion is very small and expensive. A platter for 2 is S$110 and nothing in it?? A few quails etc. Dessert is a small chocolate cake in a pool of big platter. Came home still hungry and have to eat toast. Overall, very expensive. Better to eat at SKY 57 for the same price and bigger portion and choice. Service is good - but not worth the price. View is better from SKY 57. OUE is opposite SKY 57. Too expensive!
4
I think my title sums it all. The food, ambience and in-restaurant service is impeccable in all my visits. It falls short of the 5 star only because of how they handled reservations over the phone. I made a booking via hungrygowhere.com asking for a window side table if possible. They called on the day itself to confirm my reservation. Before I could enquire about my special request, the lady who called had abruptly put down the phone. It got even more interesting later when the restaurant called me up about 3 hours later. I wasn't able to pick up at that moment so I called back. A guy answered this time round saying he tried to call me earlier trying to confirm my reservation. What came to my mind was did the earlier lady confirm my reservation? When I enquired about my table arrangement, he sounded unhappy and told me that the restaurant is fully booked so he cannot guarantee a window seat. Really odd! This review isn't to bash the restaurant but I hope the management can see my review cos I really liked the food and ambience
5
Actually we just got here as plan B as plan A was fully booked but we didn't regret at all. Amazing location overlooking Marina Bay and facing Marina Bay Sands. The service and the food was very good and everything well balanced. Food choice is between French, Japanese and Chinese each choice with 5-6 starters and 5-6 mains. Very nice choices with exquisite ingredients like wagyu, hokkaido scallop or foie gras. As we were 4 ppl we had the chance to taste each others dishes which were all great... Can really recommend dishes like steak tartar, lobster risotto or the kungpao wagyu... The food was paired with a great recommendation of the sommelier. Service is flawless and i was really happy to see how they interact. The ambience is modern and not too extravagant so you feel quite relaxed here. The only negative point was the final bill but it is to everyone how much you order and consume, most dishes range like sgd 25-30 starter and sgd 40-65 main, wines all over sgd 100
4
I was pleasantly surprised by everything at Me@OUE. The service is excellent, the sommelier picked the right wines, the service team are always positive and can never help you enough, well trained but sincerely helpful.The food choices are immense, you can have all of one style or mix it up as I liked to do. The ability to have dessert/cocktails/pre-drinks outside with those stunning views of Marina Bay is also a great plus.Wonderful experience all round. Highly recommend it to you
5
Made a reservation in advance for a birthday celebration and was given a good table with a view. Ordered 4 dishes and all were exquisite in terms of display and taste. Will definitely anyone going there for anniversary, drinks or other special occasion
5
We spend an wonderful moment, delicious foods. Be careful somme are very spicy. Unfortunately, the wines are very expensive. Have a drink after diner or desert on the terrace. unforgettable moment
5
Good food + service - worth visiting.
It's my third time dining. Various choices of food - french, chinese and japanese.
5
The food was great. The idea of three cuisines in the same restaurant is great. The service was excellent.I found it a bit pricy but I guess thats the price you have to pay in Singapore for getting good food and good service
5
~2 of our colleagues were leaving and we'd had a great set lunch selection here~I ate lite and it was absolutely sumptuous beautifully cooked crystal prawns~we'd asked for a bread selection which wasn't normally provided at lunch but got the fresh squid ink ones everyone loved~the thing about having a 3 in one selection of Chinese/Japanese/French is that we'd always have someone for everyone in our group~well attended to service and we were not dressed for the more business casual lunch time crowd draw a big plus for us~while there is an ala carte menu, if you're not fussy and want to experience the range, go for the mix n match set menus "BEST Value" see my menu photos posted~I'd used a 30% Discount voucher from UOB and all in a good place to chat and chil
4
Really appreciate the efforts the hosts and hostesses have given us when we were there making the overall experience a delightful one
3
A great location. A fantastic view over Marina Bay. But....It misses the class and quality you would expect from such place. It starts with the cheap looking carpet when exiting the elevator... Completely out of place. The hostess was friendly and professional. The club area is nice and the layout allows for a nice get together with friends. But .. judging from the visitors, it's not the hot place it pretends or wishes to be. The outdoor lounge are is nice and offers a great view over the Marina Bay Area. A great place to have a drink. The restaurant was unfortunately not impressive. Again great service from the Filipina hostess. But the service in the restaurant was not up to the required standard. Serving from the wrong side, leaning over your plate, etc, etc, I guess a lack of training and hindered by the foreign worker quota restriction which requires not so motivated Singaporean staff to be employed which so quickly give you the typical food-court service treatment. We were with a group of four and none of us was particular impressed with the food quality. NeitherTaste nor Creativity scored above "very average". The staff has little clue about the wines they offer.. In all a somewhat overrated restaurant. Unfortunately
3
Very nice environment and outside view.However, restn will be perfect if serving staffs (especially those walking around in coats) could show more sincerity and smile on their face
5
Excellent from beginning to end. Super friendly, excellent service, amazing food. They even put a candle and wrote "happy birthday John" on my dessert. Loved it!!
5
Went there a few hours before returning to Europe. Where good food and staff as was the view on the balcony where we had our pre dinner drinks
5
From our arrival at the entrance foyer this was an unbeatable experience in service topped only by the stunning views & exceptional food. We loved it & will definitely return. It's pricy, but perfect for an occasion..starting with a drink at the open air bar followed by dinner.
5
Went there for food. Staff were meticulous, knowledgable. Facilitated post dinner drink outside as well. Good recommendation for food As well.
5
My parents were visiting Singapore and we decided to go to Me@Oue. The 3 of us loved the place. Food is delicious, service is great and view is beautiful. Price is a bit above average but it is worth it.
4
I was having birthday treat with my family on that day. The food was nice and Marina Bay Sand was just in front of us. We all had a good time☺
5
Good view food and service. Casual but intimate setting. Japanese French and Chinese kitchen options are fantastic  
5
Dined at here last night with my family, a whooping 12 of us. The menu is a interesting selection from Japanese, French and Chinese cuisine. I started with the beef tartare. Perfectly marinated and very pleasant. It was light yet opulent. I had the Sakiko Cod from the Japanese menu as my main. This was recommended by one of the staff, and it was one of the best fish mains I've had in a very long time. IMO, fish can be tricky. So, to wow me completely is rare. No frills, done right. Divine. Had the eclairs for desserts, very decadent, sinful and wonderfully rich. Service was attentive, lighthearted and efficient. Our waiter knew and understood the menu so was able to recommend when we stumbled. Overall, it was a lovely evening, topped with a view, we felt very spoilt and left very satisfied.
3
It's a pretty good rooftop dining experience with some interesting dishes. It's really not fusion cuisine, but three separate menu choices... Japanese, French and Chinese, each with the chef's individual twist on things. My friends thought their food was good. I had a Chinese chicken salad appetizer that was interesting and very spicy. My sea bream tasted like it was sauteed in three day old grease and then sat on the stove for another three days. The sommelier recommendation was superb. The wine list was extremely pricey for bottles. The restaurant appeared to be full of " business" people on expense accounts, we seemed to be the only ones there not in business suits. If you want rooftop dining it's ok.
4
Coming from a Japanese background myself, it will be very much appreciated to serve to your customer a hot hand towel especially when you are serving Japanese cuisine. Also, do instruct your service crew to walk slowly, because my seat had been bumped by at least 3 different servers
5
Everything perfect, except for the seasonal haze caused by fires in Indonesia. Still managed to get an excellent view of the marina bay area and "Esplanade Drive", which was part of the F1 route.Excellent customer service and wine selection
4
My wife and I recently went to ME@OUE for dinner. We had a very nice time there with good food, excellent service and a fantastic view. We felt welcomed from the point where we were greeted downstairs being led to the lift, at the entrance of the restaurant and then to the table. It was a tad expensive but it was a very nice dining experience
4
The location is great and food is fabulous. Full menus of French, Chinese and Japanese cuisine. The staff are very attentive and efficient with the excepted of the lady who rang up to confirm the booking; she needs further telephone etiquette training. It is expensive but a wonderful treat.
5
Went here on my last night in Singapore to celebrate my honeymoon. The dishes are none other than perfect, staff are extremely friendly and good to have a laugh with. The bar outside has a good selection of drinks and even when my wife made a request of a drink that wasn't on the menu, the bartender still made it, that's what you call service ! Christian Long who we met is a great guy and we had a laugh with him. The views are amazing, after dinner try get a table overlooking the marina, for me this was the best view (better than Ce La Vi Club Lounge). Thank You for a perfect ending to our honeymoon Me@oue 
4
I had visited your restaurant with no expectation. We came as a couple and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food in taste and presentation. Your chef deserves great kudos.The atmosphere was a tad chilly, and the ambience was quiet cold too but this was overcome by the warmth, courteous and professional approach of the your staff.However, the music sounded like there was only one output from a small speaker from one corner of the huge layout. Perhaps, a more surround sound with broader depth could be suggested? Thank you
4
We were having a surprise b-day dinner for a friend in which we blind-folded her all the way to the restaurant, and the service crew helped us out too!Food was great and the view from up there is excellent! 
4
Very slick service without being fussy at this high level restaurant. My wife chose from the Japanese menu and selected the charcoal pork which she felt was rather bland whereas I had the Chinese red lobster with chili which was excellent. My wife then had a rather soggy tarte tatin which was exchanged for another dessert. The manager was very apologetic and both desserts were removed from the bill. Apart from these glitches this is an excellent establishment and one I would return to in the future
5
We had a wonderful time at ME. Besides the jaw dropping view of the Singapore skyline, the service was impeccable and every dish was creative and meticulously presented. The food and wine was great. Excellent place for a business function or private family dinner!
4
This place is facing the MBS. It is on top of an office building. The deco and design are great, food served is French, Japanese and Chinese so you have the choice. The terrace is great. Unfortunately one cannot smoke on the armchairs which means that I will not go back. The guy at the reception on floor 1 was not nice at all when we arrived telling us that the restaurant was closed. We had to insist and ask him to call the manager to find out that it was opened and serving customers as other clients atrived after us. The restaurant was 90% empty and refusing clients which by any standard is crazy. If the owner is reading this I would love an explanation. So overally it was a very good dinner in a fine place. The wine list was great. We chose a Chateau Nenin 2007. If the guy at the downstairs reception was nicer and one could smoke on the armchair on the terrace this place could qualify as my favorite restaurant on the island
4
Brought the fiancÃ©e out for an early birthday dinner and was pleasantly charmed by both the service and the food. The chef was very accommodating in allowing us to select one of the specialty appetizers to taken as a main course while the server made excellent recommendations for our dinner that night. We would especially recommend the Beef Tartare and Buta Misoyaki.Thanks for a great night! The price is fair for the value we received and we will find some chance to return again in future
5
On a business trip recently take here for lunch, it another in the line of surprises which is Singpore. Great view, very good food and excellent service. Highly enjoyabl
5
Great cocktails, terrific view, excellent service and overall tasty food. Made a special birthday occassion all that more special. Thank you Me@OUE
5
Food quality and embience is awesome.. Try their lobster, scallop and prawn in crabshell under chinese appetizer.  
5
simply stunning... food, service, view all out of this world... could not recommend higher, it's not the cheapest, but the value is there...
4
This is probably the nicest place right across from Sands! Had a drink during HH and it's nice to chill before dinner.
5
I had dinner here with visitors to Singapore. We had asked for a table close to the windows and overlooking the bay and this was granted. A great start and one that only got better. Rajin was our waiter and he was fantastic. Yes the menu is pricey but the food, oh yum. The crab appetiser was amazing ! The squid ink bread rolls which are served as complimentary, were delicious.We wanted to go outside and take in the view, so Rajin suggested we have our Appetisers and then he held the preparation of our main meals until we returned inside. Rajin even escorted us to the outside viewing deck and took photos for us.We all finished our meals with desert and everyone was a winner so make sure you keep enough room.Yes it was expensive however we are not likely to do this everyday. And I am very happy that we did. It was a truly memorable experience

This restaurant is located on the top floor of an office building .Almost all tables offer a vista of the Singapore River, the iconic Marina Bay Sands and the palm - like Art Science Museum. a sweeping panorama of the skyline of Singapore. The view is the draw. The menu is confusing - a choice of Japanese, French and Chinese food. At first glance, nothing seemed appetizing . It was one of those places where you kinda order without knowing what to expect . fortunately - my choices turned out ok . the mushroom risotto was flavorful , the ravioli was tasty. the dishes here are elegantly presented in small portions. it's a good place for business luncheons -ask for those seats that kinda ' cocoon ' you . I was here for lunch on the few visits - but I think evening drinks with the skyline would be pretty too.
5
This is my first time to this restaurant, located on the top floor of OUE Building. The restaurant serves 3 different cuisine types under 1 roof: Japanese, French and Chinese. But I was here for drinks, instead of the food. I headed for the open-air terrace outside. I was impressed by the view. What greeted me was a great view of the Marina Bay, with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on the opposite side of the bay. The panaromic view stretches from Beach Road to the left to Marina Bay Financial Centre to the right.But I also needed a drink, and so I ordered... Here are the highlights:- Baby Sumo: $25. Yamazaki 12 years infused with sour plums, fresh lemon juice, egg white and Sirop de canne. Dry shaken and served on the rocks. This rocks! One of my favourite for the night. Its easy to drink and what I like was the plum flavoured salt that they lined on the edge of the glass, just like a margarita. Lovely!- Woof Woof: $25. Sweet Wee Scallywag (Speyside Malt), Dubbonet Rouge, fresh mint and Grapefruit. I find this drink rather fruity. Personally I prefer stronger drinks, which followed after this.- Get Smokey: $23. Black Jamaisan 12 year old rum, Campari, la Quintinye Rouge with a dash of grapefruit bitters and Peychaudâ€™s Bitters. Woodchips add the smokey flavour and dried citrus added for flavour. This was served in a nice glass flask, which you pour into a glass with a piece of dried orange. The flavour reminds me of Oolong tea. Easy to drink.- Wiggo: $23. Plymouth Navy Strength shaken with fresh lemon juice, Sirop de Canne, fresh mint and lime wedges. Served in an Absinthe rinsed glass and topped with Chapuy Brut. This was good. Served in a martini glass, I liked the lemon favour and finished this in no time.This is a great place to chill, with friendly service staffs who always display a smile even when there are lots of customers when I was there
5
The only things better than the view of the beautiful Singaporean skyline from the 18th floor of the OUE building are the service, ambiance, menu and wine list. Said differently, ME@OUE is just about as close to perfect a restaurant as you can get. Add the casual outdoors observation deck and Loic Esposito ((the GM) and his team are doing just about everything right. ME@OUE is the perfect location for a quite dinner for two, a formal business dinner or hosting informal group gatherings. Definitely on the short list of "do not miss" restaurants in Singapore
4
So the winner about this place is obviously the location. Its the top floor and its obviously a great place to come for after work drinks - there is a outdoor balcony so this is place. This place also has very high ceilings which is why the restaurant is very nice. For business there is a private room which is completely separate from the restaurant and therefore very private. The food variety is different - Japanese, Chinese and French on 3 different menus as opposed to fusion. Food is okay but probably wont remember it after the meal. If it is Chinese, seems a bit pricey but there is so much variety so its possible to order from the other menus.

My company of 4 and I was there on 26/8/15 and I had the best Bloody Mary,hands down!!I used to think another bar I used to frequent made the best but the one that Naz made for me yesterday was the bomb!!Place could do with a little more staff. Nevertheless, the ones who served us were fantabulous:)Will go there again for the Bloody Mary ; only if it's made by Naz!! X

We decided to try out this restaurant given it is known for its good view of Marina Bay Sands. The ambiance was great. It was lunch time but the tables are arranged in such a way every table had its privacy. Food met our expectations. Two of us had the set lunches and the other two ordered a la carte. The set lunch was value for money: my daughter had the Caesar salad and the Asian lobster fish while I had a delicious Chinese styled pumpkin soup with a duck main course that came with fois gras. The portion of the duck slices were the same size as the fois gras, and both were equally scrumptious! The lamb and beef mains on the a la carte menu were tasty and came at the specified doneness.It was my husband's birthday. While we didn't order a cake, Alvin surprised us by giving him a slice of cake with a candle. That was a very nice gesture. We enjoyed our experience and will recommend the restaurant. All the staff members were friendly and offered their opinion on our dishes
5
Food portion is generous esp. the Chinese Lobster seafood soup.Great service. Nice view. Esp. Outdoor view.  
5
Great food, Great view.Staff was extremely helpful, professional, and courteous. Food presentation was also superb. Pricing wise, please expect to pay for what you get; great service, great food, great view, will not be 'budget' pricing.

Me@OUE commands one of the most dramatic views of downtown Singapore and offers an exquisite culinary experience. The restaurant is located on the rooftop terrace of the OUE tower, which allows the guests to enjoy the view of Singapore's skyline, the beautiful Marina Bay Sands, Singapore flyer, and the overall Marina Bay. Make sure to come early for your dinner to enjoy a drink on the terrace. Food is always excellent. Three chefs offer dishes from Japanese, French, and Chinese cuisines. You can mix or follow one tradition, in both cases I always enjoyed the result. Cool ambience, great view, excellent food. It is a must in Singapore

We recently visited me@oue for our last honeymoon dinner in Singapore. I mentioned to the restaurant on booking that it was our honeymoon and they really made us feel special. They reserved a perfect table outside on the balcony for us to watch the marina bay sands light show, and gave us the best table inside. The view was just incredible! Service was exceptional, they even gave us a celebratory dessert. What let the restaurant down however was the food. The food was quite average and a little confused at times. The restaurant is very expensive for the quality of food. Overall a lovely evening though, we just wish we had enjoyed the food more
3
The decor and ambience is definitely something that sets it apart from the other restaurants. But that is pretty much it. Menu is pretty much limited and taste wise... average. We tried maguro and mapo tofu for starters. And ordered 2 fish and 1 pork dish. We also ordered a bottle of wine & 2 dessert. Bill came up to approx 450. Not a place i will revisit
4
It's a luxury japanese/fusion restaurant on top of a skyscraper, so be prepared to spend some money. In any case, it's not just the panorama that you are paying for: the meal is good
5
A special occasion with my wife, and Me@OUE was perfect. The service from our welcome, to the drinks on the terrace, to our waiter Joe Joe over dinner was excellent. The views are of course magnificent, and likewise the food and drinks were great. You're paying a premium for the location, but the level of service compensated. Christian the restaurant manager provided an impressive additional personal touch.Tip: On the terrace the table for two at the far corner has the best view for drinks and is quiet enough that it feels almost like a private date
3
Place is nice overlooking the city view if ya sitting outside. However standard of food is pretty average for the price.
5
Me@OUE provide us of exelent service and fantastic night view along with a tasty food....^^ I like it. 
5
Very attentive staff who made good recommendations. Good range of food from all 3 menu. Second visit this year and will look forward to coming back again.
5
One of the best views on the Marina Bay! Through a friend our family got a great outdoor table facing the bay on this special occasion! Food was great and the service outstanding. If you need to celebrate an occasion, this is the place
4
Went there for birthday celebration. It was good. As they have varieties of cuisines, good for group gatherings where different people can choose their preferred cuisine
4
Great place for family celebration and dining. Highly recommended for special occasion. Prices are above average.
4
Scenic view of MBS for window seats.
Really nice setting for a quiet and intimate dinner. :):):):):)
5
Always great to come back. Fantastic venue with excellent service of friendly staff and very nice food. Even so it's a bit costly, it's a luxury treat you should do once and while. Better go for quality than quantity.

My wife and I visited with her parents for dinner. We arrived at 6:15 pm and the restaurant was empty, except for a few people having drinks on the balcony. The food was good but not the best we had during the trip. I was expecting much more from the wait staff. Our waiter was gruff, didn't smile and just didn't seem like he wanted to be working there. Their "signature" tofu could use some help in the presentation department; it looked like it had been dumped in a bowl with no garnish. At least the view is nice.
5
~we decided to have Aaron's farewell lunch here and looked forward to their set menu which changes often~a last minute reservation for 8 pax was made, we arrived 1150am and waited 10mins before being ushered up the lift to ME@OUE :)~we were greeted like we belonged and guys we actually don't, dressed in round neck tees and jeans did not fit into the business attired lunch crowd, THUMBs UP for service~we also had to add 2 more to our table so they moved us to an even larger table remembering who's Fiji still water glass was placed when we swapped tables and switched places, THUMBs UP~I'd ordered a lobster risotto which wasn't on the menu but the manager said the chef will whip that up easily, while my colleagues ordered from the set lunch menu (choice galore) :) ~Lunch was a joy while we dined and talked, the place filled up prolly 70% inside just before we left :)Bottomline, folks with me took photos of what they ate, always a good sign (er yes), but my main was a wonderful delight ringed with squid ink!a good visit you'd hardly find Fine Dining less pretentious :
5
Me@OUE is an amazing place , we booked for a special evening and had a tremendous night The place is modern and new with it's restaurant as a penthouse with great views over Marina Bay and the Fullerton Bay Hotel below We had pre dinner drinks first on the outdoor terrace which were very memorable before going inside to a nice table only to be moved 5 minutes later to a large curved seat for 8 people but where 2 of us could enjoy a truly special meal and outlook over the bay We had great champagne and wine with superb food and warm friendly service Thanks for making this a night to remember
4
I celebrated my boyfriend's birthday with his family at Me@OUE last Saturday. Coincidentally there was NDP rehearsal on the same day and I have requested for a table that will allow us to enjoy the firewoks view. Firstly, the service is pretty good. Food-wise, we love the cod fish and the portion of beef for 2 was really big! Lastly, the view of the firewoks is really nice!
2
The waiter did not inform that the signature dish was not available, we only found out when we wanted to place our food order. It was only 730pm which was very early and the signature dish is not available. During our course of meal, the waiter wanted to serve the dish course of food even though one of our guest was still eating. We highlighted on the spot to the manager but he didn't even bother to find out what had happened or apologised. what an evening for my guests and me. They definitely need to train their staff and management. i would not go back to this place again
3
Went there for lunch. The ambience was good. The food is average in general . service is average but one of the staff dropped a plate right next to me, my heart dropped but the person didn't even bother to apologies.. I am not considering to come back for the food.
5
We had enjoyed in good delights for the night spent at ME@OUE. The great night views of Singapore rivers with laser works @ around 8:30pm. We should not forget the delicious dinner filling our stomach too. We will be back for next upcoming event. An unforgetable dinner and chilling choice when you are in Singapore.
4
Nice view with great food! Recommended if you have someone to impress on! But be prepared for $$$$$!
5
Great restaurant, excellent service, nice concept w 3 kitchens Japanese / Chinese and French. All seem to be blending nicely into each other and choosing a dish from each to share is the perfect way to go. View is mind blowing ... esp when having drinks or taking the desert on the balcony. Absolute have to go to place ... issue is that its frequently booked for functions so you not get a table on your desired da
5
Whenever there is something special to celebrate, we seem to end up here. Brought a friend from Switzerland. Got super lucky since the fireworks rehearsal for SG 50 did just start when we sipped our champagne outside. Fantastic ambience, 5 star cuisine and 5 star waiters and service people. We absolutely love the interesting combination of chinese, japanese and french cuisine. The wine selection is probably the best in town, so when you re up for something special - this is the place. Me@OUE Team - we ll be back soon 
4
Nice ambience with great service. Great venue to see NDP fireworks, nice chill out place after dinner at the bar area.  
5
A restaurant with a great view, great food (albeit a tad pricey) and great ambience :) a highly recommended dining place
5
Great place, great food, great service, great wines, great view, what else? Went there for the birthday of my wife and this was perfect.
5
Service at this kind of venue is expected to be good and it was right. Food is amazingly not too bad but do expect to pay a premium. 4 adults and 2 kids cost about S$6xx.The view was amazing and be sure to get this place for any expected fireworks display
4
Go before sunset to catch the gorgeous view of marina bay with marina bay sands in the background.Food quality varies.The sirloin steak was good but not the foie gras.As for dessert, the Ã‰clair was delicious but not the Pear Tartin.Loved the squid ink bread that they served.Chinese kitchen was down due to some problems with the wok.A tad pricey if you don't have any discounts.Service is polished and professional
4
Had lunch with a colleague and a couple of clients. Service was prompt and food as good. A little pricey perhaps but I guess one has to pay for the view. Had the steak tartare to start with and it was quite good. hHad the unagi for my main course and I really enjoyed it. Great atmosphere for a business lunch
4
It's a good fine dining option in Marina Bay. Not cheap but good quality. The sirloin steak was well cooked and tasty, and the Pork Belly was also very nice. Overall service was decent and the atmosphere good. Worth a visit if you fancy something more upscale
4
One of the must do's on your Singapore list. The view is amazing, directly across from MBS, the food is excellent, the staff is friendly and if you're lucky you can get a window seat. A place you can recommend to friends
5
Me & my wife went to ME@OUE in June to celebrate her birthday.We have a very enjoyable time there, the service was exceptional, especially the waiter that is serving us. As I am celebration my wife birthday yesterday, he has taken the initiative to recommend that I order the cholocate cake in the desert menu. And it come with the Happy Birthday wording and a small candle. This small gesture was very heartening to my wife and she ended the day a very happy women. My sincere thanks to ME@OUE and the waiter for such as wonderful dinner and a truly great service. I look forward to return for more enjoyable dinner with your restaurant.Thank you
2
The ocean perched fish from the Japanese collection is way too salty even when eaten with the white rice. We had feedback to the waiter.
4
Food is good, service is prompt.Price is on the high side of without palate discount. Would dine here again if ME@OUE stays in palate outlets 
5
Server was attentive. Flexible with serving to alter the sashimi for a person instead of 2. My friend doesn't take sashimi. Nice view and great ambience. Spacing between table was great, there is a personal space between each table.
3
The cooking here is solid - we enjoyed the prawn and crayfish from the chinese menu and the buta misoyaki, though I found the spinach veloute that came with the scallops too watery and strangely similar to thunder tea rice broth. In contrast, I found the service condescending (sweetbreads, foie gras and ceviche are in my vocabulary, thank you) and slow .Really good value if you're dining with the palate card discount
5
Food is tasteful and /view is fantastic. The waiter and waitress who served my table are very friendly and got knowledge of the menu. Great recommendation of the food and wines
4
The contemporary interior makes everything beautiful and it feels like we're dining in a golden galaxy =D Friendly service, mains was good (we're having the japanese cod) and the sides were fun (unexpected/unusual choice of sides). Desserts (eclair) was worth gaining-weight for. A little bit pricey (spent more than at Alkaff and Equinox, without steaks and wine =((( 
5
Spent S$5000 mainly on the japanese steaks (highly recommended) and wines/champagne. For 9 pax. Don't let that price put you off, there's other stuff on the menu and wine list. Everything excellent. Enjoyed. Guests were happy. Great food, great view of the Marina Bay Sands. Only comment from my friends who are wine experts, wines are overpriced even for a top notch restaurant
3
My feedback as I am paying premium prices :- table not balance. But was rectified without my request as the waiter was quick to spot. This should not be happening for my dinning experience to have such a broken table at a high end restaurant. Disgusted. - course of food did not serve together and my partner had to wait for hers as I have finished my apertizer. - only a cocktail came as complimentary for my partner's birthday. That's very a small thing and not even one of the desserts we ordered was not complimentary. Anyway we do not beg and will pay. You need to know what is about give and take a little and not all about money and business. - staffs are professional and able to communicate. But that's not all about a good restaurant. - food was good. - dislike your layout of tables being too close to each other. No privacy and I could see you ate trying to have more tables for business. But please bear in mind we pay high price for it and can't feel comfortable having our food relaxing and peace of mind as we are also disturbed by our neighbours conversations.
5
Love the food choice from French, Japanese to Chinese to select. Quality food is very good and also bundled with the stunning view is priceless
3
Food: More to fusion. (Chinese + French + Japanese)Service: 4 starsAmbience: 5 stars (stunning view: Singapore flyer, Marina Boulevard, Merlion, Esplanade, Floating platform...etc)A place to catch-up and drink with friends, dinner with family and romantic place suitable for couples
5
Went there for drinks with friends. It was highly recommended and rightly so. it is on the 50th Floor of the OUE building. Got a lovely view of the waterbody and the Marina bay sands.Would like to try the food the next time I go there. We stuck to mainly finger food which was average.Tips: They have happy hours from 6-8pm. Please make a reservation before you go because the place is usually packed
5
Good food, i love the lobster , many choices of Wine,nice view, and excellent service Good place for any celebration,    
3
food was good, very tasty but tiny portions hungry when left, waiting staff were a little overbearing, you couldn't sneeze without them holding out a napkin
4
Being a visitor to Singapore I asked my friend who lives there to suggest a place which had a good view where we could have a drink and he chose ME@OUE.We had prawn, crab and pork starters from the Chinese menu. All were delicious. We started with cocktails and then moved onto wine and other liquor. Service was efficient and pleasant. The prices are on the higher side but then you're paying for all this, so it was worth it
5
We had the most fabulous dining experience with stunning view of MBS. The ambience in the restaurant and quality of food were fantastic. The moment we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted and led like VIPs to our reserved table. Service was immaculate, attentive and second to none. Everything were exactly what we had expected and we had a seamless dining and unforgettable experience. Staff were extremely professional, well trained and friendly. Kudos to the Management and Staff of ME@OUE for a job well done. I will definitely recommend ME@OUE as the venue of choice to all my friends and corporate clients and will definitely organized similar events as such in the near future. Well done
4
If you are the type of person who enjoys both partying and dining, this would be one of the best places in Singapore. This venue kind of reminded me of the famous chain restaurants such as 'Sushi Samba' or 'Aqua'. If you know these restaurants yourself, this is the must-visit-place in Singapore for you. Only reason why I would give it 'Excellent' would be the wine I had. I am sure they have a very good selection of wines but the one I chose somehow wasn't so perfect for me. But I guess this is just personal preference so don't worry so much about their wine list. If you want, you can move your table outside and eat while enjoying a lovely night view. You get to see Marina Bay and etc. Awesome place! :)
3
Goodness perfectly nice, but not special enough to justify the cost. I went because I saw a review saying it was great for watching sunset, the the sun sets on the other side of the building so that disappointed also.
4
The view from the restaurant was fantastic as we can see the MBS and the surrounding view. The food was good and the services were superb - from the time we entered into the building till the time we finished our food. Will definitely come back again as this was my 2nd visit
4
The food was great! Ambience and view not bad too. The staffs are very helpful, professional and friendly. We enjoyed the food most but my wife's lobster risotto had a tiny lobster shell in it.
5
Everything was absolutely fantastic. Big kudos to the chef.See you againYou have grate wine list but I am Greek and I think there is position for the excellent Greek wine
4
Took my mom out for Mother's Day celebration. The King Prawn Fried Rice, Lobster Risotto and the Miso soup were most delicious. We had a great photo at the bar with Marina Bay Sands as backdrop. One of the thing that kept me coming back was the amazing squid croissant. An idea for service was to have pick up that it was Mother's Day and offer my mom a cake/drink or something to extend that thought, it would have make a big difference and leave a nice memory
4
We came here for a family dinner and we're positively impressed. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but well worth the money. There are many good restaurants around the Marina Bay area with great views, but this one has also a nice atmosphere and interesting food offering. The wine menu is extensive, which is not usual in Singapore
5
The food was excellent! Specially recommending the lobster risotto. It was heavenly. And the staff know the dishes off the back of their head. Would go there again
5
This restaurant is very elegant and has a stunning panoramic view on the bay. Don't miss it if you visit Singapor
4
Been to me@OUE about 4~5 times now and food has been consistently good - nothing innovative, but just well-executed and fresh. Tried the Ohmi steak recently and it was mind-blowing, gotta have it. Views are stunning as always, love taking visitors to this spot for aperitif and after-work drinks.The service can be exceptional as with my most recent visit, our server was a young Indian lad who was very polished, thoughtful and had just the right amount of attentiveness. The ladies on the 1st floor and maitre d' are pleasant as always. There is however this scrawny lad with a goatee who is perpetually sulky and consistently condescending in his tone and manner. All-in-all, great spot, especially for a special occasion
5
best service so far in SG.Food was good. Moved on to the outdoor area after dinner for drinks. Great view.
4
ME@OUE is blessed with an amazing view of the bay and some key landmarks.Was there for lunch, during which they offer an abridged menu. The food is excellent yet I believe it is 2x the pricing it should have for the A la carte items (even for Singapore and with the view in mind).Not offering a la carte dessert items during lunch is a turn off.Friendly staff and agile management
4
Service staff very friendly. Service is excellent. Ambience is very good. As for the food, Kung Pow Wagyu Beef is excellent. Chilli Lobster is very good. The pork is a bit too fat and the duck is quite tough
4
We were positively surprised by the lovely ambiance in the restaurant and happy with the view over the bay area. The three available kitchens were all tempting but this time we opted for the French one and it was lovely and tasty
5
We had a hard time choosing from the selection of French, Japanese and Chinese cuisines. Eventually we settled on the sea bream and the buta misoyaki, with a baked stuff crab for appetizer. At the waiter's recommendation, we also had a lobster chowder.Each dish was well prepared and had us looking forward to more. The intervals between each dish was well paced also. We ended the dinner with a Chocolate Gâteáux paired with ginger sorbet, which I will strongly recommend. Our first visit to ME@OUE had been great and certainly look forward to enjoying such a wonderful dinner again

Having been at this restaurant about 6 months ago and had a relatively OK evening the last time we chose the venue again for our regular weekend night out with 11 friends. It looked the same at first but the experience was totally different, almost rivaling the only other nightmare evening we had in Singapore in the four years we have been here. We arrived on time for our booking at 8.30pm and got on with ordering our food and drinks... of course you first had to work hard to get the attention of the seemingly busy waiters and waitresses. The poor oldish Indian waiter was the only one trying but he could not create any ripples in the sea of indifference. When we finally managed to give our orders, first the wine took quite a while to arrive and there was only 2 bottles left - which by the way seems to be a repeating theme in most Singapore restaurants, either I am extremely good or unlucky in finding the last one or two bottles of the most popular wine or it is a common trick used to up the guests wine budget - and then the appetizers showed up at random on their own free will prompting the more unlucky friends to fill up time with more bread and butter. Once we finally had all the starters served, the looong wait for the main course started. Just after 10pm, the main courses finally started to make an appearance with the same random arrival pattern. And the turbot which three ladies had ordered was not even edible so had to go back and an new uninspiring cod dish had to be prepared leaving the three ladies stranded and starving for another 20 minutes. And you think by now it was enough to spoil a good weekend night.. No you are wrong, then the whole stupid part of the night started... After our dinner, most gentlemen in our group like having a cigar with the final drinks and coffees. That is why we always look for fine dining venues with alfresco areas, of which there are luckily many in Singapore. Me@OUE had been the same the first time, with its surrounding terrace area, it offered a perfect vista to enjoy our group's once a week indulgence. We had asked for the same terrace arrangement again for the after dinner time and got refused with the excuse that smoking is not permitted. When we mentioned that the last time was OK and what had changed, the answer - despite the numerous attempts of our poor Indian waiter - was negative, "No, we changed our setup Sir and do not allow for smoking on the terrace or even in the smoking areas of the outdoor bar" which they also had. Very disappointed but we accepted the fact and started to look out for alternative spots to have our coffee. At that point I made the mistake of walking out on the terrace to get some fresh air only to see that a couple sitting outside on the terrace were happily having their cigars in front of the other guests and security personnel of the restaurant. Of course I had to ask how and why that was possible and we got rejected. The answer from an arrogant and bossy Lady Manager of the evening was a shameless, "Sir, they are our Guests"... And she managed that even without blushing.. As if we were not guests and just annoying intruders...! 11 Intruders who would soon be paying a bill of in excess of 1500 SGD, still not worthy to be called Guests..! I will cut this long story already here and not get into the even more stupid arguments and events that followed on from here... But I guess my point is quite clear. Don't know how common sense and courtesy went out of the window at this so-called fine dining venue but even the fine-dining element was nothing to brag about on the night..
4
The food and views are amazing, the wine is great though expensive. Sipping a tea outdoors after lunch is recommended.
5
Had a great all round dining experience, I picked this restaurant for its location and menus, after researching online. It was a special night for us as we got engaged that same evening, and the restaurant set the tone.Meal, service, ambience everything was fantastic, we had a great meal and enjoyed the experience very much. Next time we are in Singapore I will visit ME@OUE again

Excellent value happy hour from 6-8 week nights make the incredible views all the more enjoyable. I look forward to returning
3
From the Chinese menu, we tried the chicken salad, and lobster main. Both were quite good. From the French menu we tried the duck - cooked medium. It was too chewy. We stayed away from the Japanese food as a lot of it is flown directly from Japan, which doesn't have the same appeal since Fukushima's nuclear meltdown. Extensive choice of wine. Ambience was a little dark and cold so make sure you take a cardigan. Photos of food are hard to take. Price was ok $200 for two mains + entree + 2 glasses of wine which came down to $133 thanks to American Express. I don't feel like I need to go again though
4
The food by the Iron Chef, Kenichi is very interesting and good. However, I find the ambience of this restaurant is too noisy is you want a quiet and peaceful meal. I also think the music playing in the background is not appropriate
4
The food was excellent, the service staff friendly. Two complaints though:-the table was only ready about 30 minutes after the reserved time-the (very friendly) waiter arm-twisted us into ordering starters without telling the price - which turned out to be almost S$ 200 for 3 pax. Clearly our mistake NOT to have asked, but I don't think this reflects very well on the restaurant
3
A few pointers: 1) service was excellent and waitress & waiters were full of smiles2) the entrance experience to the restaurant could be improved with the wine cellar being more well-maintained and not give the impression of back of house. Barricades that separates the entrance pathway and the wine preparation area could be more tastefully done, the current red barricade does not give the restaurant the class it deserves 3) appetiser was good and flavorful; on the other hand, main course could have been better, esp. For the unagi don, to let the flavors stand out more, giving diners greater element of surprise 4) there could be more acoustic treatment to give the place a softer touch to minimise sound reverberation which affects the ambience of the place. Restaurant became pretty noisy when it gets crowde
5
Called the restaurant a week in advance and booked dinner to celebrate my partner's birthday. I requested for a birthday message to be written on the dessert, it was done beautifully.Their menu is divided into Japanese, French and Chinese cuisines, each offering appetizers & main courses to choose from.Pretty extensive wine menu, though we went for champagne in the end.Food was excellent in general, we especially enjoyed the Japanese cod dish. After we're done with dinner, we asked to move outdoors to enjoy the spectacular city view at night. Their service staff were friendly and very accommodating.Albeit a little pricey, well worth it for special occasions
5
Excellent food, service, and breathtaking view! Will definitely come back! It was an awesome experience
3
Expensive even for Singapore for the quality of food, which wasn't exceptional in any way. Nice views
5
I was in Singapore for business with a group of colleagues and decided to take them to this restaurant for one of our dinners in town. Made the reservation in advance but didn't take any notice on the dress code requirement. Thankfully the ME@OUE team was kind enough to make an exception for us as a lot of us just landed before the dinner.I requested for a table by the window so that my colleagues could enjoy the great view from the restaurant and was delighted to find they have indeed accommodated that request. We were a group of six and spent about $800 on a lot of drinks (special mention to their cheesecake cocktails) and three course meals for most of us. I had the baked crab starter which was absolutely delightful but I don't see it anymore on their menu online. Service, food, and ambiance of this restaurant are spot on and suitable for friends and business alike. One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore for sure. I loved our dinner so much that I booked it again for dinner (12 of us this time!) before our flight back to the UK
5
I hosted a business dinner at ME@OUE some weeks back and was so impressed with the ambience, staff and the roof terrace that I made reservations at time to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. One would think the roof terrace over looking the MBS, or the beautiful decor would be the drawcard for the return - but it was actually the staff and service. The greetings we received from literally every staff member from the hostess at the elevator on ground floor through to the servers was just second to none. A special mention to Christian who oversaw our table and ensure throughout the evening that everything was as it should be was fantastic. Back to the restaurant - from a dining experience it was very good. One must accept that it is Fine Dining and it is in Singapore so expect the $$$$ to be spent. The food was great and highly recommend the Beef Tartare was one of the best I have experienced and I am a beef tartare lover from all over the world - This one is a must if you like this dishThe mains were all good but the deserts were a stand out. Wine list is very lumpy price wise but for those who can - it is extensive and impressiveThe restaurant turned after 11pm into a nightclub called 'The Monachy' which our younger guests loved and again the staff were tremendous and watched over my crew while we enjoyed the Singapore views from this exceptional roof terraceHighly recommended restaurant for that special occasion or if the corporate card is up of it - you will blow your international guests away with this one!!Thanks again to the staff for making our evening a wonderful nigh
5
We visited the restaurant on Thursday even ing , we booked a table outside at the bar area, views are spectacular we then ate in the restaurant which was busy but not too noisy! The staff were excellent at explaining all the choices, and as there are 3 different cuisines there is plenty of choice! The food was excellent, we had a fantastic evening, we have been before and we will definitely be going back
5
Gave this restaurant a try as it was on the amex palate restaurant list. Very pleased I did - Great view, wonderful service and gastronomical food. What more to ask for. :
3
I like the options for executive set lunch - French, Chinese and Japanese. Per person averaging $90 is expensive. Still and sparkling water with 3 course set lunch
1
The only thing good about this restaurant is the view. Service was extremely slow. After asking for the bill the credit card was taken. After waiting more than 20 minutes, I went to the desk to request my card. The restaurant was not bust as there were only three tables occupied. This is typical of each couse. The slow service is why we were one of the last three tables. Extremely bad serviceFood only ordinary. We will probably never return to this establishmen
5
Is celebrating my anniversary and the server is very knowledgable and recommend menu for us and the food serve perfectly and they also offer us a dessert and my wife was very surprise and we we enjoy the food and service there
3
My first impression of the restaurant was not a good one - I did not think I was taken seriously by the 2 men at the door. I had the lobster which was of decent portion while my friend had the lamb. Would have loved a wider selection of non-alcoholic beverages though. Service was slightly slow as restaurant was at its full capacity. Restaurant was decorated well, I enjoyed a decent view from where we were seated. When my friend and I were leaving, the 2 men somewhat acknowledged my presence. I wonder if our 3-course ala carte lunch had anything to do with it

Good atmosphere , excellent service and food too. We would like to compliment Mark, our server, for his excellent service and patience. We really enjoyed the food and will definitely be back
5
My second time at ME@OUE, previously dined there for dinner and was so impressed by the quality of the service, the variety and quality of cuisine (French, Japanese, Chinese) and the ambience of the sky high venue that it was a no brainer to return for lunch.An important client lunch, don't let me down! And again, stellar on all accounts and the client remarked on all this as well ... Score
4
Great atmosphere for special occasion, staff were observant and patience towards our queries. Very detailed explanation on the dishes on the menu, will definately go back again and strongly recommend this place to my friends
5
We dined at ME for my partner's birthday last week and had the most wonderful meal. The view is fantastic and they made the extra effort to give us a good table as it was his Birthday. The range of food is great and the service was absolutely wonderful! Very excited to go back; my new favourite place in Singapore!
4
A very good restaurant at, a reasonable price given the location and views that come with it. We were there for a business dinner, and had an excellent start waiting for a table having a drink on the balcony taking in the fantastic view. The menu is eclectic coming from the 3 kitchens (Chinese, Japanese and French) which is a little unusual, but the food was good. Service was fantastic
5
We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and everything was wonderful - the stunning view, the service and the delicious food
4
Its quite interesting to have mix and match from Jap, French and Chinese food. Food is well presented and tasted good. Service is attentive and unobtrusive. View is very nice
3
The views from this restaurant are stunning and the concept of the restaurant is great i.e. mix and match courses from French, Japanese and Chinese menus. However, the execution was a bit hit and miss. There appeared to be more staff than customers yet we were either looking for service or they felt intrusive. After taking about half an hour to choose our food, our order was taken only for the waiter to return and inform us one of the starters was no longer available. I think they tried to be too clever with the bread, it was supposed to be a squid ink brioche, it was more like a greasy croissant - not very nice at all. My tempura starter was average however the kitchen showed what it was truly capable of with the most delicious miso cod that followed.This restaurant is not quite as good as it thinks it is, at present its selling points are more the concept and the views but it has the potential be so much more
4
The food is pretty good but a tad to salty in my opinion. Everything else is great! View 5 stars, service 5 stars and I was v lucky I was there the night of chingay and I got free fireworks
5
The food was superb, the speed was great, the wine was a little on the pricey side, but my wife and I simply went for what we love... and it it all turned out perfectly. We were very well looked after by the staff and the manager spent some time with us at the end of the evening which was a very nice personal touch. We'll certainly be going back be it for personal or business
5
We went there for our anniversary. From our arrival we were greeted with a friendly maitre dit full of humour and very attentive to our needs. The service was flawless from start to finish! The food is just amazing and mouthwatering. No need to say more: grab your phone, do a booking and come here for the experience of a lifetime :
5
ME@OUE is easily one of the best restaurants in Singapore, not only for the excellent food (the three menus include French, Japanese and Chinese cuisines) but also the fantastic view and outstanding service.We have visited ME@OUE several times now, and it has quickly become our 'go to' venue for a special occasion or when visitors are in town. Highly recommended
5
I was travelling alone in Singapore last week and did not shy away eating alone at nice restaurants. Me@oue is a beautiful Restaurant with an amazing view. They made me feel very welcome and my great waiter recommended me this and that. There was a great choice on the card and finally I decided on two main courses instead of a starter and a main. I had the duck and the cod. Both were delicious. You know, unfortunately I don't remember what I had for dessert :). Overall I recommend this place very much and hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. Cheers Zen

We went for a Valentine's Day special on 14/2/15.Overall, the quality of the food was not bad and the service was on point as well.However, we did feel a bit of a rush in the air because there were two seatings. It could just be me but I felt that the staff had this air of being in a rush to get us out of there. Eventually though, we took our time to eat and finished the meal to a lot of time to spare.There was some difficulty in understanding some of the dishes served as the enunciation of the dishes were not clear. It took us a while to understand that we were being recommended their squid ink bread and that the ice was pistachio-flavoured.But these are small issues as the dinner was in sum a very pleasant one. The only concern I have is that the restaurant needed a signed and completed authorisation form for charges deductible in case of cancellation and I understand that they were just trying to protect themselves from errant and irresponsible customers but I am pretty sure no finance and Internet security personnel would ever approve giving away any credit card information and signed forms to any merchant and it's a policy that the company should review
4
We had dinner at ME@OUE during CNY eve and it was a good experience. The food was above average and the view is amanzing. Overall, the staff is nice and at times helpful yet theres this one lady who kept on "forcing" us to order the Yu Sheng because other people did. Whilst everything seemed good, the restaurant seemed to have lacked some sort of a WOW factor despite the amazing view
4
This place has a nice ambience and the food are decent. A little bit noisy though probably due to the open kitchen
5
Went as a marriage dinner. Staff, ambience, position and food all fantastic. Not cheap, but good value from all perspectives. Order anything - it's all good
4
One thing about this restaurant that i can safely say is unbeaten, is their spectacular view by front the marina. Amazing view sky dine view concept. in to their food, we ordered their famous chili lobster, served with mantao as well as their steak. Their chili crab had a robus of sweet and spice at the right level and it was amazing. However, their steak was nothing of as great. The meat was mildly flavoured and it wasn't worth the price. Service was to the usual. One filipino staff who ushered me to my table, however was rude. she was impatient for me to take my order and while deciding for merely that 20-30 seconds she said "will come back when you're ready" and walked off. Also, she wasn't friendly while I questioned her about some of the items in the menu. However, I did sight the manager of the place going table to table to ask for their reviews. Good work into the staffs in general, but just poor service from that one Filipino lady.
4
Good place for a scenic, romantic dinner. Food ok, but the scenary and surroundings make for good experienc
4
Nice atmosphere and good service from staffs, i definitely recommend this place. It is suitable for couple to chill out and relax there. You should order cocktails because is quite good taste
4
decided to do an early valentine dinner with wife on 12.2.2015. we do that usually, no point paying through the nose on 14feb for poorer food & service.^^ there were quite good reviews for me@oue at OUE Bayfront. this place offers a choice of 3 cuisine – french/european, japanese & chinese. & of course it offers spectacular views on the roof terrace. parking S$3.21 after 6pm. service quite good, friendly not the top professional type which could be overly formal. we asked for recommendations. server suggested red lobster & lamb (chinese), miso cod, the signature A4 ohmi wagyu (japanese) and pan-seared dorade (a fish) & tenderloin (french). for appetisers, he recommended crystal prawns (chinese), poached egg (french). we enquire about sashimi moriawase. i showed the server the sashimi blog photo of which included chutoro, otoro, uni etc. the server returned to say that they were having maguro, sea bream etc (probably hirame, hamachi etc) – not exciting at all! we were served a squid ink brioche & butter. we ordered the maguro tartare. this came to akami (lean toro), hotate & avocado. the starter was very nice, though i agreed with my wife that it was not very fine (or refine). it was a good cut so it was very tasty, but no better than the S$18.80 chirashi don at sumiya. the scallop carpaccio was very fresh & tasty, a reasonable serving. the server recommended the red lobster (S$55). i saw the photos before & thought it was 1/2 lobster but in fact it was a full whole lobster. the lobster was fresh, bouncy, very tasty & the chilli crustaceans sauce was excellent, better than many indifferent chilli crab places.the signature A4 ohmi wagyu was quite expectedly, superb! this was japan standard, better than most of the bingo wagyu 丰后和牛we had in kyushu (yufuin, beppu, fukuoka) during our recent trip. it was better than what we had at arossa previously & also better than mikuni. it cost nearly 2x what we paid at arossa (but arossa is closed now & even just prior to closing, palate privileges (50% discount was withdrawn & the wagyu cut was no more on the menu). i ordered the S$16 lava cake because it had good reviews. that was a mistake. it was competent not great.after dinner, we went to the roof terrace outside for the nice night views of MBS & the marina bay. it was windy, there were very few people & it was a very pleasant & brief stop.^^ overall, price was S$193nett (inclusive of a S$20 red wine with no discount) after 50% palate discounts for 2pax, including japanese A4 ohmi wagyu & a whole lobster. for me that was a very good deal. i would certainly come back for both the red lobster & also the ohmi wagyu. it was not quite fine dining yet, but it was overall pretty good & the 2 mains were just awesome!See my full reviews & photos at = http://chefquak.com/2015/02/14/excellent-ohmi-wagyu-early-valentine-dinner-me-oue-on-13feb2015

This is brilliant, never did I expect it to be so good, ambiance was terrific, food was good and fresh, service was top notch. My partner birthday and was wished well by the manager.This is what I call service, where most restaurants in Singapore lacked that personal touch. The only down side was that, a group of japanese visitors were next to our table, but that was minor, they settled down soon after. 6 stars
4
Nice place, nice ambience, good service, great food with different cuisines to make everyone happy with interesting vine list.We were celebrating our son's 20th anniversary and the staff did offer him a glass of champagne and special dessert as a surprise.The only negative part is that we can't eat outdoor while the terrace is very nice
5
This was my second visit to ME@OUE, this time with two colleagues. The squid ink home made rolls are different , but very tasty. The meal and food has a great combination of choice and lived up to expectation. We had a booth overlooking the bay, very private and comfortable. The staff and management are very attentive and well turned out. Well done. My only criticism is that the wine is quite expensive and a greater range of price choice to suite the needs of different occasions is my only recommendation. Andrew 
5
Location and view are great. From the terrace you can see the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyerand the Esplanade. At this restaurant they offer French, Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Some typical dishes arepreparedand served in a modern way, yet very authentic. even though it's an open kitchen, you do not smell anything and no smell of food on your clothes.Staff is most friendly, very polite and attentive. Taste and quality of food are excellent and fresh. We had Beef Tartar and Tuna-avocado tartar for starter. Maincourse: maine lobster risottoand mapo tofu. The portions of main courses were surprisingly great! The dessertscame also in great quantity. We had eclaire with madagascar vanilla icecream and a caramellized apple tarte - delicious!
4
good food , great service and super ambience i loved the place espcially the out doors after dinner....
5
Our server JoJo was very attentive to us throughout our entire dining experience. Service rendered was really fantastic :) We ordered salted egg crayfish and ebi tempura for our appetisers, and found both to be absolutely delightful! For mains, we both enjoyed my miso cod - perfectly seasoned and seared, but found the lobster risotto a tad too cheesy for our liking. The lobster, which was poached in butter, was to die for though! The lobster meat was done just nicely at the right temp and for the right duration. Divine. Desserts was a miss for us. The dark choc molten cake was really too bitter for my liking. Didn't finish that in the end. View and ambience were great! Overall we enjoyed ourselves :
4
I am not sure what would possess someone to call a restaurant ME@OUE - I am sure there is a clever and meaningful background to the name, but it is not easy trying to explain it to taxi drivers.It's a great setting; high ceilings, well laid out, decent space between the tables. We were lucky enough to be seated next to the window, and the views are spectacular - the best I have seen from a restaurant in Singapore.It's unfair to call the food 'fusion' - which is a culinary expression that fills me with dread (why do so many people want to mess with classic regional cuisines?). This is more of a merger of individual kitchens, to offer a broad variety of menu options. We moved between the geographical alternatives on offer, and everything we had was delicious. Be open-minded about what you order, and share dishes (or steal from other people's plates) - some of the tastiest dishes were not ones that I would have naturally chosen from the menu
4
Excellent food presentation. My main course had so much salt it was inedible but the dessert was delicious as well as the starter. Menu isn't extensive which can be a drawback. High ceiling, floor to ceiling windows and fabulous view all contribute to a pleasant ambiance
4
This was my first visit and I thought it was fine. Not exceptional but fine. I like the fact that they take gluten issues seriously. The had provided a gluten free menu, but it was limited. Rest assured, they can also make necessary changes to many other items on the menu. I found this to be the better way to go. Wines are very high end. They need more mid priced product and those that were listed were not in stock. Overall I was pleased. Nice dinner.
5
I really liked the concept with the 3 different kitchens. You can choose your appetizer chinese, the main course japanese and the desert French - a great combination.Good Service, great Food, excellent Location with perfect Food
5
We went to ME@OUE by recommendation! We were not disappointed! Rooftop bar was excellent and open to the public ! restaurant staff were great, nothing was too much trouble, food excellent, and we watched the light show from Marina bay as a bonus!We will definitely be back! Many thanks for a memorable evening
5
Great view ever as good as ku de ta. Watched the laser show at 8 oclock on balcony. Be great from the bar where you can just go for drinks. Good if complex choices on menu, but excellent staff to explsin it all. ALVIN kept topping up our wine with no charge and was very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend it, and no more expensive than other Marina Bay restuarants with a view.
4
this is a great place. Great view, friendly staff (although the people at the entrance can make it difficult for you to get into if you don't know anyone). The bar/lounge area is great. Anant and steven are both extremely nice friendly managers.... hard to find in singapore! Although I havent had the chance to try the food here, but at night for the drinks/cocktails... excellent. decent pricing. The staff is very friendly, smiles everywhere. The only negative thing I can even think of is the saturday nights where the crowd there tend to be a bit more pretentious and a lot more younger louder crowd with a mix review on the music they play. Unforunately its not open on sundays, but definately a great place Mon - Fri! Would definately recommend this place for locals and tourists alike
5
superb look over the Marina, classy and elegant ambience and fantastic food. Love the combination of french, chinese and japanese cuisine, every time we come. Meals have a lot of cativity. The staff is very attending, just what you exoect from a "top of the range" place in town.Our favourite in the Lion City
2
It was my 3rd time to have lunch out there. I found out the food was ok but nothing outstanding. Also it was shock to see that waiter just re-used the plastic mat on the table without properly cleaning which presented a huge hygiene concern to me. Given this, I would go there again
2
Terribly disappointed because I had heard good things about the place. Firstly, the service. Fancily dressed host/hostesses, essentially redundant strutting around with their noses up in the air and talking in their forced strange accents( very irritating, especially coupled with their insincere smiles) the servers on the other hand were Inadequately staffed or trained. Food were sitting on the counters for minutes, idle staff who saw it sitting there just let it sit there cause it's not the section they r in charged of. It's supposed to be a fine dining place, service fall terribly short.Secondly, the menu: Japanese, Chinese, French. Very limited selection. And essentially none of the food was authentic, it's was all fusion, probably good enough to fool the western expats n tourists. It's like eating Chinese in a rural part of Europe. U can get much better fusion n definitely better authentic jap, Chinese n French for the similar pricing or less. Lastly, ambience. The fridge n food storage is next to their private lift. When u enter the restaurant when the lift door opens, u smell meat, frozen meat, a damp stale smell.then you go past the wine cellar, u r greeted coldly by the staff n smells of food in a dimly lit dining hall. The ventilation of the place can be better. U dun want to smell like food on a fine dining date. The view of marina bay sands and the lagoon is quite impressive. I guess it's good for drinks, except the cocktails r not yummy. Ok it's a good place to impress ya date, with the view, the chic decor n the price tag. Other than that, I have better places to go
1
This place is great as a restaurant but avoid their late night / club events unless you want to be surrounded by the worst in arrogant expat community - we were threatened and pushed about by an extremely drunk patron who, it turned out, was a big spender in the club, told by security not to make a fuss and asked to leave. Hmm, not very class
4
Worth the trip just for the views, but the food is quite good if a bit quirky. The service is above average for Singapore. The wines are intersting and diverse. I would recommend going there for lunch,
4
Went for lunch, I really enjoyed the view. Ambience is also nice, very spacious sitting, bright. However, their tentative of being a Chinese / Japanese / Italian at the same time is weird, the set lunch menu has only one option of each. You can mix and match the appetizer with main course, but again feel that it is very limited.They also have the full menu, but pricier
4
We just had a dinner at Me@Oue on roof top of Oue bayfront (50th).I booked a table for 2 a week before and got a window. This place does not have many tables, booking in advance is highly recommended. Interestingly you have 3 different cuisines to enjoy, Japanese, French and Chinese. We ordered two glasses of champagne and wine, two entrées (Maguro Tartare/Alaska crab), two main (Lobster risotto/Japanese cod) and one desert (Strawberry and Jasmine) to share so we could taste a bit of all three cuisines. The staffs were kind and friendly and the pace of serving each dish was just right for us. I enjoyed the most of food except Maguro tartare. Im a bit sensitive to fish and it wasnt as fresh as I expect. However Lobster Risotto with extra white truffle added was beautiful and fresh, Japanese Cod was cooked soft and chewy. I didnt enjoy a glass of French red thou, I loved my Champagne ;) The dessert, Starwberry and Jasmine ice-cream, tasted nicer than it looks on the plate. I dont enjoy too creamy and sweet taste so much thou, this one was just right to us and I enjoyed the combination of texture as well. If you are a member of American Express Platinum, you will get pleased even more by discount benefit at the end. Am I going to visit this place again? 4 letter. Yeap! Hope you enjoy your Friday night at Me@Oue as us. :
4
Tuck at a side along Fullerton Road. High class atmosphere but menu prices are reasonable. The waiters are very helpful and smiling. Fantastic skyline view at +30 floor and unblocked. You can see Marina Bay Sands from here and see the laser show in the evening. Nice wine collection. Always go for the red wines. Enjoy!
5
I'll admit I was a little sceptical about eating at a restaurant with 3 menus, but having tried a dish from all of them I have to say the food was superb. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and the lobster ravioli was very tasty. It was even hard to say no to a second squid ink bread roll! The view is lovely, we will definitely be returning
5
A choice of Japanese, French and Chinese dishes was something of a first for me. The food did not disappoint: the sushi was excellent and the Chinese beef tender and tasty. We were spoilt by an outstanding couple of bottles of Lynch Bages 1996: quite simply one of the smoothest wines I have ever tasted
4
It was a birthday dinner for a friend and I am glad I chose this restaurant. When we first walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by very professional and obliging staff. The ambience was excellent and impressive, commanding a picturesque view of Marina Bay. I chose the Japanese dishes and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. My friends were equally impressed with their French and Chinese dishes respectively. It was an excellent dinner experience but I felt that perhaps the restaurant was slightly short staffed as dishes were not cleared away quickly enough and the dishes took a while to arrive. Despite this, I commend the staff for being very professional, especially the manager Christian.I definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to my next visit
3
The perfect view comes at a price, which the slightly pushy waiters will do their best to increase. Of the three separate kitchens, French, Chinese, and Japanese the latter was disappointing - don't bother with the sushi. Some of the Chinese dishes had great flavour, and their strength was a large joint of beef which arrived beautifully cooked.
3
It is always a good moment shared with friends or family at the Me; have a drink before dinner, enjoy the terrace, the view, chill out and enjoy your luck… Service is good but food was disappointing (for all guests and from starter to dessert). For the price, it should be one standard higher. Wines are quiet expensive as well (starts at 200$/bottle but goes really high…). At the end, more than 900$ for 4 people… and we did not go for the most expensive… Food should have been much better for this price: it was not bad but nothing special. Overall, it remains a great location for a nice evening if you wallet allows it

I went there for dinner 2 days ago. I choose this place to celebrate my husband birthday as I was attracted by the 3 types of cuisines (Japanese, Fresh & Chinese) that we can choose from and also the nice view.The view is really nice. I made advanced booking and requested for window table. I appreciated that we were indeed given a window table with Marina Bay Sand view and big round sofa. I love the squid ink bread. The foie gras terrine (French) and the cod fish (Chinese) are very nice. I don't like the dessert menu, not much choice. My husband and my son do not want to order any dessert initially as non appeals to them. But I influenced them to try the dessert since it was our first time there. The main reason I insisted on having dessert is because when i made the reservation, I have enquired whether do the restaurant provide anything special for birthday celebration. 2 days before the date, they call and told me they don't have anything special for celebration but they can design "Happy 45th Birthday" and maybe a candle for my husband dessert. I think that will be fine. So I specifically order a slice of chocolate cake and specified the cake to be for him. I was really disappointed that when the dessert was served, nothing at all. I think they did not communicated this to the staff. They should have communicated that to to staffs as noted in the reservation but somehow was missed out. With this, it makes my celebration not completed and that is really a minus point. The Strawberry Tarte with financier biscuit is quite nice though. After the meal, we walked to the open air area to take nice photo from this rooftop restaurant
5
Best fireworks view, even better than sky 57 or kudeta.
Food was amazing, just that it is very pricey. Still, it was worth every penny.
They serve chinese, japanese and western, in a fusion twist.
5
Drop dead view. Modern, sleek setting. Delicious food, plated beautifully. Outstanding service. Japanese, French, and Chinese cuisine. Everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed their choices.
4
The service was exceptional
The round tables facing Marina Bay are the nicest (than the classical)
The food was fresh and tasty (sashimi + beef trio)
Endeless wine list (exceptional)
A bit expensive but amazing restaurant with a fantastic view
To do!!

Me@OUE was recommended to me when I told a friend in Singapore I wanted a bar and restaurant with a great view. Me@OUE fitted the bill perfectly. Situated directly opposite Marina Bay Sands and with the financial district to the right, Me@OUE has amazing views, along with an outdoor area to truly enjoy pre-dinner drinks at sundown. We arrived at Happy Hour time so pleasantly enjoyed several lower price drinks – great timing, given how expensive Singapore is in general for drinking. Upon moving into the restaurant for dinner, we were presented with a menu split out by cuisine – Chinese, Japanese and French. Now, when I read this was a 3-cuisine inspired restaurant, I assumed the three chefs had come together to create an eclectic mix of options. What we actually got was 3 different options – approximately 5 starters and 5 mains from each cuisine-type. After overhearing our discussions, a lovely waiter came over and recommended we share the steak special. 3 cuts of steak on the same plate as a sharing option – one in Chinese style, one in Japanese style and, finally, one a la French cuisine. Served with probably one the best ever side dishes of mashed potato I’ve ever eaten, this was a mouth-watering delight. Wine is expensive in Singapore with the cheapest bottle generally coming in at no less than £60. After being advised that our original choice wasn’t available, the house wine was recommended to us – a gorgeous rioja. We were thoroughly delighted with the taste (and the price). Having started the meal with sashimi, foie gras and steak tartare, we ended with a shared chocolate éclair – huge and scrumptious. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for character, charm and great food with a view
4
I wasn't expecting too much, the idea of 3 chefs and 3 cuisine styles struck me as gimmicky and with the terrace and restaurant views over the bay the punters will flock without the need for fine dining quality or consistency. However, I was wrong, pleasantly wrong, shocked in fact. Happy hour drinks on the terrace preceded dinner in the restaurant, where the staff food and drink suggestions were spot on - no drive to upsell, just good honest recommendations reacting to our framework of desires. The staff were a key part of our enjoying this experience. Our waiter could see we were struggling with how best to navigate the 3 food styles each with a separate menu you can jump between. He suggested a sharing beef platter for the 3 of us - with styles from each of the French, Japanese and Chinese kitchens. At SGD200 including sides this proved to be an inspired choice. We each had a starter (my steak tartare was the best I've ever had, significantly so) before finishing by sharing a single portion of French profiteroles. This was more than adequate. Wine, as always in SG, was expensive and in the absence of the modest choice I'd made I was recommended a couple of similarly priced alternatives - we went with the French Syrah (available by the glass at the same rate as by the bottle) - this was perfectly good enough. This place was worthy of a visit for locals and tourists alike. Dress code wasn't specified as I recall, smart casual was the norm albeit some business dress was in evidence
5
The service was amazing. If you get a chance, ask for Ronald - he provided the best service I have ever received. The sommelier was attentive, knowledgeable and brought great personality to the experience as well. Great service can make a night our but it was made exceptional by the great food. Brilliant fusion of French, Japanese and Chinese - sometimes all on the same plate (it worked). A fantastic setting overlooking Marina Bay.This is well worth a trip and will be going back.Value for money. It's not cheap and, as it was a business dinner, we leaned towards the more expensive wines, but I do think it was great value for money
4
I have not try the restaurant (unfortunately!). The bar, outdoor, is nice, with a wonderful view on the bay, a bit windy but it is not a problem. First impression was a rude service (we couldn’t seat despite an empty terrace because we were not planning to eat – is it because I drink an apple juice that I have to be considered like this?). Finally, we decided to order some nibbles and had a table and a new waiter who was (this time) extremely pleasant. Food is good, price are still ok for the location. When we were there, it was very quiet and will be good for a date or a chill-out time among friends, not for a party or a warm up.Minus points:- In case of rain, I don’t think it’s covered. - The music outside was very bad when inside it was great/lounge music totally in line with the place. Why
4
This place is a great place for hanging out, enjoying the marina bay view and served with good quality. Of course, the enjoyment comes at a pretty high price. Is it worth it ? The jury is out.And this is a wonderful place for inviting business associates for a good business dinner. The total quality of the food is good though not outstanding in my opinion. However, the creativity is definitively there
3
Ambience: Casual not so fine dining, upon making reservation, was informed by the customer service of the dress code. However, saw some male caucasians wearing berms and sandals. Mostly, working crowd. Nice view of MBSFood: Was average. Am a steak person but i didnt even finish my striploin. my friend had the lamb saddle, it was so bad (stale and tasteless) that she only had 2 mouthfuls and returned the food.Norwegian King Crab & Baked Tiger Prawn were good. There was a pork dish as appetizer (cant recall the name but picture as attached) was average. Dessert we had profit eclair which was also average, was expecting a richer valrhona choc sauce.Overall: Spent $600 approx for the dinner which included a bottle of wine. Will return for the drinks at the lounge but not the food. As we did inform the server re my friend's stale lamb but he only said ok will feedback but did not offer else as substitute and of course, she paid for that!
5
Whenever we’ve got guests or a client to impress, ME@OUE is the first port of call. There’s breathtaking views of Marina Bay from the restaurant and amazing terrace which just cannot be missed. However ME@OUE isn’t just spectacular views, the food is scrumptious as well. With three different types of cuisine (French/Japanese/Chinese) we always find something we want to eat no matter what mood we’re in. The staff are attentive and helpful and great at recommending a wine with dinner or the dish of the day- first class all round
3
The ladies loved It..rooftop, great views, DJ from Boujis HK , but French Ramsey is more focused on food..and he has no recollection of what he had ..either good or bad.
5
We had a great meal tonight at Me@oue. The food was excellent, Norwegian crab, sea bass, artichoke heart salad and lovely deserts. Service was very attentive and accommodating. Staff were good to deal with and helpful in their recommendations. Christian Long, the Manager, was very engaging and once again helpful. The view is spectacular. Try it, even if only for a drink.Not cheap but value from our perspective
3
The view is amazing and the place got a cool vibe. The concept is attractive, with the menu designed by three famous chefs of different origins, but the result does not totally live up to the promise. Dishes are not as appealing as expected, service is a bit awkward, and the experience is overall pleasant although forgettable
5
Me@OUE is located in the business district at the top of the OUE building. We started out on the terrace where we enjoyed a drink. The terrace offers a fantastic view and a light breeze.The restaurant offered both super service, great meat and a good wine list.Prices are at the high end for Singapore, but are still much below the prices charged at gourmet restaurants in most European or US cities
2
Went there for the first time for a business lunch. The fact is the view is nice, like other restaurant is this area.Really modern restaurant with high ceiling, you can really enjoy the view, with all those large glass panel overlooking marina bay, and the good thing is the tables are spacious... Unfortunately the food was mediocre. Yes, I do understand the hard work needed to manage 3 types of cuisine in the same time (Japanese, Chinese and French), but for example, the appetizer was overly too salty and small, 3 tiny pieces of salmon complimenting a too salty Tabouleh... oups.For main course I choose the braised beef, which to my surprised once arrived, looks more like a baby food, than anything else... Presentation is a big Failed, and taste, well, still too salty...Luckily for me the dessert saved the day...The service was ok, nothing to say.Shall I go back, yes provided they do an afternoon tea...

Having read the previous reviews I was wondering whether I was looking at the same restaurant! Our encounter was totally different and I would personally rate this as one of our most enjoyable eating experiences to date............My wife and I recently visited Singapore and some friends invited us to dinner. Cocktails at the rooftop bar in the Fullerton Bay Hotel beforehand (highly recommended!) followed by dinner at OUE. To be honest I was unsure what to expect but I was delighted with the overall experience. Great setting, cool restaurant and the food was superb. You effectively have a choice from 3 menus in one, Japanese, Chinese or French and you can mix and math, so to speak. I chose a garlic prawn starter followed by the spice beef pieces, both were exceptional. I managed to steal a taste of my wife's Foie Gras and I have to say it was the best I have tasted. The service was also of a very high quality and our host made some great wine selections to compliment our food. We eventually moved into the bar next door (great music!) and enjoyed the rest of our evening. All in all, a great culinary experience, I would rate it up there with our best

Came here for lunch with some colleagues from work. Needless to say the views are great but the food was not as good as I had expected. Service great and overall left hungry! Probably won't come back here for lunch. Pre dinner drinks maybe. i had fried oyster with radish- ok but too small. chicken with fried rice was also ok aside had better from hawker stall and capuchinno cake to finish which was probably the best item of the meal

First of all i have to say that the ME has great Service, a spectacular view, a cool athmosphere and excellent and perfectly made drinks. It's definitely worth a visit.But here's why it's not as good as it could be:We went there in the evening right before we went somewhere else for dinner. Therefore we would have appreciated if nuts or similar had been served with the Drinks. In Addition to that Music was so Bad i can't described. They had a "DJ" which was not doing anything but standing at the Bar drinking champagne and letting run his playlist of Pop Songs! How can you literally Play POP in a Bar which is so stylish and cool!Please hire a new DJ that knows how to adapt the music to the athmosphere. Deep House / Lounge Tunes Would have been perfect! He ruined the whole athmosphere that day...Furthermore some of the speakers were broken and made a horrible sound that distorted the music..

I hosted a business dinner at Me@Oue during a recent conference. The experience was outstanding in every way. The view over the bay is spectacular. When we arrived, we went out to the terrace for a cocktail. It was simply breathtaking. The service was superb. We were not rushed into dinner and the server was extremely helpful. His suggestions for courses and drinks were excellent. The food was fabulous - we had a mixture of all three cuisines. Yes, it's pricey, but it's absolutely worth every penny. I would definitely eat here again if I'm ever back in Singapore and have already recommended to two colleagues traveling there soon

Our server was friendly without being overbearing, the food was creative and delicious. The only minor drawbacks are no corkage and slightly overpriced wines.
