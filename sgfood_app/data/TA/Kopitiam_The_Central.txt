There are many choice of food you can choose. The place is clean and the food quality is acceptable. The best thing is the price. I could have the chicken rice, desert and ice tea in only SGD 6.5.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food at Kopitiam during my visit at The Central Mall. The beef was tender and delicious. I never expected that the meal will cost that cheap especially in a shopping mall food court.

Kopitiam serves some of the best local hawker food that are available in Singapore. The prices are cheap (Singapore standard without foreign exchange conversion) and the service is prompt and efficient too. Clean environment and always full of action and full of live in this kopitiam

For years, the so-called hot tea with milk has been a total disappointment at its outlet especially "tea shi" (meaning tea with carnation milk) !It is no better than its counterpart "tea with milk" from MacDonald : totally no taste of Lipton tea. Rather, it has the lousy after taste of faint Milo plus some third class coffee so to speak! The nearby Han's and Toast Box versions are better choices

Kopitam is a chance to eat local and eat large.Huge range of stalls and payment is by Kopitam card - get one at the dispensing machines at the front.At meal times the dining room can be very, very crowded and this is part of the vibe. If you see a paper or a packet of tissues then that space is taken ("Choped"

Great little counter in the Kopitiam. One of many different counters. The soups are excellent and cheap. The lady who was at the counter was very friendly and helpful. She recommended returning for the roast duck. Open 24/7. Beer is available at some of the counters. Ducked in there one day during a torrential rainstorm. A soup and Tiger beer changed the mood of the afternoon for the better
