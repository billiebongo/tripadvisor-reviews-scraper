Went there for lunch. Service was ok but food was pathetic. We ordered 6 South Indian meals,one for each of us. The rasam was spoilt and the sambhar was not tasty.Thats all I can say
5
Don‚Äôt even think about debating that. Unlimited serving size, fresh hot yummy South Indian thali. We go there every single weekend. Do try their parupu podi with rice and a generous helping of ghee. Dont wait - go there now!
5
The spices are made from scratch to ensure that it is authentic. Tastes good and has good ambience. Well worth the money.

Situated next to MTR, this restaurant provides good food. I had gone for a breakfast on a Tuesday (it was locked on Wednesday, may be their weekly holiday). Though it is supposed to start at 8.30 am, they were busy with morning prayers and hence before they could ask me for what I wanted, it was 8.45 or so. I asked them their suggestion as it was my first time and I was offered a Tiffix mix, which had 1 idli and 1 vada, pongal, upma and I was also offered filter coffee. The food was very good in quality and the lady in charge, who is dressed in traditional saree, greets you with a good morning and asks you for further helpings on chatni, sambar etc. Since it was early morning, the crowd was not there, though the place was milling with crowd the previous evening, for dinner, when I was passing through the place. Liked the food and the place and may visit, if MTR is locked

If ever I need home cooked South Indian food - cooked with love and care - I go to Lukshmi Naarasimhan. The food is tasty but not rich, freshly made (as they run out of items ), served with care (they will actually look at what is missing in your plate and serve more of it). Once I saw a young boy pecking at his dish - the owner (this a family run business with 3 sisters and a few more family members) came and enquired why he wasn't eating.. she replaced the dish with another dish to his liking. You will never find a restaurant where they will say " why are you eating plain yoghurt rice, let me fetch you some potato to go with it!".The place is a little chaotic but all the regulars know that the food is worth the chaos.I love their wholesome South Indian thali or chappathi thali (when the no rice phase sets in). Their rava khichidi is a must try. There was a time they made the most amazing sweet called "Ashoka" and ladoos. I hope they do so again.Give this a try for anything South Indian and you will be hooked like I am

MAny people forget about this nice places next to the more famous MTR. It is authentic food like in my friend's home. The ladies who run the place are fantastic and genuine people. I could only see the local people in the place. You must go here for a meal. One meal at MTR and one at this place
5
Very polite staff at your service if you want home cooked style food then this is the restaurantVery simple ambience but good food and really a treat to all those wanting vegetarian food.I visit this outlet every month at least 3 times and no regrets.Those reading this review please don't miss eating here it's along Serangoon road opposite perumal temple

Homely indian veg food. Huge south indian menu served with love. Quick service, decent ambience, reasonable priced. Food doesnt make you feel heavy like other indian restaurant food.
5
We had Medhi Vada, Cheese Dosa and Rava Ghee Dosa. All are very good.
Excellent food and fresh cutneys.
Simple restaurant setting but helpful staff.
They don't use garlic and onion.
5
Authentic homemade South Indian food. Great taste, fresh and healthy with authentic flavours. A sure shot recommendation for anyone looking for good South Indian food in Singapore

Good service, mostly the person serving there is the owner of the restaurent, dont get that wrong when you order food. The serve good, food tastes like home food.. some or very good..
5
I went there once after going to City Sq Shopping Mall. There were a lot of ppl dining there. I ordered and the food was served after about a few mins. The service was gd.

This one is next to MTR restaurant but has limited variety of food, although food is good and place is clean. But restaurant sometimes closed and not available every time. I tried snacks and vegetarian thali, very good. Service is ok

This restaurant situated at the end of Little India (Opp to Perumal Temple)As you enter the place you are welcomed by an elderly lady which makes is homely. Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the kitchen where you can see the chefs working. The menu offers a wide variety of Indian food I‚Äôve been here several times (probably more than 100 times) and I‚Äôd tasted almost every item in the menu. You can have their Madras or Andhra Thali. There are variety of Dosa‚Äôs including authentic Adai and Pesarattu. Recently they also have introduced MLA Pesarattu (Pesarattu with Upma). Food is simply great and if you believe in homemade food, this is the best place in Singapore. Food is fresh, less spice and above all the owners of this restaurant, always there serve with smile. It‚Äôs a pity that I don‚Äôt drink Coffee, but my friends having tasted the coffee here, vouch that this is exactly as Filter Coffee at home. If you visit more than 3 - 4 times, it is likely that the owners will know you by name. As i know, this is the only restaurant serves food without garlic and onion

This is One reasonably priced restaurnts and ran by vegetarin hindu people.Only cons is the order taking and serving is very late and i had to come out after waiting for 20 mins with out unable to order.Meals and sambar rice, curd rice are good items and There is no bad concerns about food
5
This restaurant is run by a couple of sisters. They are very articulate and service minded when attending to customers. The food is also good. They sometimes are a little short handed, but that's the nature of the food industry in Singapore- hard to get workers is a common refrain.I like their thalis best
4
The food is authentic and meal is good. Some of the tiffin items like Pongal, Rawa Bath, Wada and filter coffee are good
5
reached here as the owner, Janani aunty was opening up the restaurant at 8am. Had piping hot b/fast and coffee. She recommended dishes to us too. Was great! the food was freshly prepared, hot and smelt and tasted great. Will be eating here often now
5
I have already posted review for this one under Sri Rajya Lakshmi Naradimhan. This seems to be a duplicate entry! Nevertheless, this is just an awesome place for all who crave very high quality Indian vegetarian food
5
Very nice and authentic South Indian food. We ate the Andhra meal - it was excellent. Place was technically closed after lunch hours, but they were very nice and let us in. The filter coffee was also very good and server properly. Thoroughly enjoyed!
5
This is by far the best place to have south indian food. The food is superb and moreover people are amazing. Padma Aunty is who is the owner goes all the way to make sure the people who eat here goes happily. The are very generous and this is the only restaurant in Singapore who asks customers unlimited times if they need extra food , they are super nice people and there is no other restaurant apart from them who are this nice. Definitely a place to visit and eat
5
Another visit to this place and I come back very satisfied The ladies that run the establishment do an excellent job not just with the food but also have some insightful comments.# they explained the benefit of a "dal powder" which looked similar to malagapudi - but they explained that this one was different and full of protein and how it should be used over rice.# they asked my daughter to keep the bowls outside the plate and make space in the plate - which they said was asking to reflecting the "space in the stomach" - a wonderful comment and also an invitation to eat to your stomachs content - and this was followed up by meticulous attention on whether you needed anything Every dish was excellent in both the South Indian and Andhra meals - and the coffee was excellent as well.Definitely worth visit

We went to Sri Lukshmi Narasimhan restaurant located in Serangoon Road, Little India (next to MTR) for breakfast and dinner. This restaurant serves good quality south indian dishes and the place is very hygienic and well maintained. I loved the mini-tiffin concept where they serve a masala dosa, 1 medu vada, 1 idli , pongal or upma and either coffee or tea. To add the food was very tasty and the chutney & sambhar were also outstanding. the staff was very friendly and the service was good . I would say this is an unknown treasure in Little India as majority of the folks would go to Saravana Bhavan or Murugan Idli or Komalas

We went to Sri Lukshmi Naarashimhan restaurant for dinner. The place is no frill basic with very warm servers. Menu card is basic, a printout on A4 paper. Prices are low, comparatively.The best part was taste. We loved Dosas. Sambar was better than many other branded restaurant. All the food including sambar, masala etc is free of Onion and Garlic, Jain food (except andra meal which has onion garlic).It is a homely kind of restaurant, no frill, low budget, offering South Indian dishes
4
This restaurant may not be eye catching but I can guarantee to you that the food they service is awesome. I have been here many times and I have always loved their food.Andhra masala dosa, vada are my favorites . One of the best value for money hotels in SIngapore - No GST and Service Charge

Have been a regular at this restaurant. Serves consistently good food that reminds one of the traditional homely restaurants (known as mess) across the small towns and villages in Tamil Nadu. Our favourites are pooris (light and fluffy), meals and filter coffee. Definitely safe and gentle food. Caring services
5
We regularly visit here for Meals in the afternoons. It's quite filling and tastes very homely. South Indian, Andhra meals, Chapati meals are typical but there are also a lot of breakfast items on offer; like dosa idli...
5
last trip to singapore,I had my meals in this great food place.enjoyed the thali meal and very good value for money.
5
It looks like an offbeat restaurant next to MTR. But it is one of the best places to eat South Indian vegetarian food. The food taste is very homely and delicious. The prices are very reasonable. I would recommend this place anytime.
5
The food is good. Good pleasant music fills the restaurant. Nice ambience. Food is served by ladies in traditional sarees.
5
My family and I have been visiting Sr Lukshmi for years now. Highly recommend to try authentic divine homely Indian food.Staff are so down to earth and friendly, one get to feel like eating at home. I enjoy every time going there. Try their recent added Nan Set. Panner + Pepper Combo is awesome

We had just arrived in Singapore on a trip and were for a quick brunch. We heard of this place, a short walk from the Farrer Park MRT and Mustafa Centre and were very happy to have tried it.It offers non-nonsense, inexpensive, South-Indian fare and generous quantities too.We tried the pongal, wadais and podi idli and they were to-die-for!We even ended up coming there again the next day for lunch, a deeply satisfying thali!An Indian traveler might rush to more well-known Kailash Parbat, Saravana Bhavan or Komala Vilas near-by, but if you want a homely meal and snacks, this is it
5
The most authentic indian vegetarian food I ever had in singapore. this is as close to what my mom wud cook at home. The balance of spices is perfect. The whole place feels like sanctum of good food with Hindu hymns playing to create a spiritual connection that defines "Annam Parabrahma Swaroopam" (food is God almighty.
5
If you are an Indian family visiting Singapore for pleasure and if you have kids, then head straight here.No-fuss clean, fresh food that is light on the stomach (my 2-year old's tummy survived 5 days of eating here).Their meal options are great and so are their

A restaurant where you get the feeling that you are eating food that has just come of the stove in your kitchen. You want a little more of that specific vegetable or an additional papad, you are served without any questions. The food is delicious and brings back memories when wholesome food was an essential ingredient of life - sad to see how things have changed. The capacity of the restaurant is limited and can fill up especially on weekends. Is worth the wait though. For those who reminisce about how it used to be when we had our mommas cook and serve food at home in the years gone by, this is the place to visit
5
'Meals' is a south indian word for thali (a round plate that holds rice and all the other curries in one place). This place has re-opened after long, and it is good news for anybody looking for the best thali (Tamil) with home-like ethics, in singapore
