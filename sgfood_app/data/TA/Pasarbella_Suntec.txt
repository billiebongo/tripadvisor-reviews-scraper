Came at late noon to find coffee, seems promising to look at the place, hip and lively place inside the boring Suntec mall, with a view to Fountain of Wealth statue, you must be comfortable inside it

Returned to Pasarbella to the Pimp My Salad outlet for another lunchtime salad this week. Generous servings and tasty. A popular venue but efficient service. I expect to be back for more in the near future.

Visited Pasarbella for lunch this week and this time tried the new Lime Truck outlet. We had 4 tacos each, all of which were very tasty. We made use of the Entertainer app which kept the bill low so the overall experience was good. Friendly and efficient service.

Random craving for something cold & sweet-but-not-too-sweet. Decided to get some Cocowhip at Sarnies. Yes, it does taste like coconut. While the flavour that immediately hits your palate isn't crazy strong, the aftertaste does linger.Cocowhip is a little bit like a soft serve, but less creamy & more icy because it's made with coconut water. (That makes it vegan btw!) It might look like a froyo swirl, but it isn't sour like froyo. I like it! It's a whole new class of its own.Though it isn't a cheap dessert by any means ($6.50 for this naked swirl, & also the only topping left on a Friday night was the espresso syrup which costs $1 - I politely declined), when you are craving a certain something like this..... You just pay, lah.Ps: Had a major brain freeze by the end of this cup. But it's worth it. ❄ Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats onl

Came here to celebrate birthdays with my friends, here’s the breakdown:Ambience: 5/5Cleanliness: 4/5Customer Service: 3/5Quality of Food: 4/5Value for Money: 4/5The Good: Local food offerings mixed with live music, hipster dishes, quaint, flavourful, with a buzz! The Bad: No customer Service, mostly self service for the food, some of the dishes are alright, some are better, depends on your selection. The Bottom Line: We will come here again, quite a variety of stores to choose from, we will come back to try the other ones!

Here at Tamarind Kitchen at Pasar Bella trying out this new restaurant who serves "thai street food". I happened to have had an AMAZING Moo Ping two weeks ago and I finally found a store that sells one! I will talk about the other Moo Ping on my other review. So here I was waiting for my order for 25 mins just to be staring face to face to 3 pcs of bbq pork where my fingers are seriously larger in size. It sad, sad, wrinkled self although priced at 8.50 seems to be even humiliated at themselves for being served! But I was hungry and so i started eating. I was cheated! It was bad looking as it is but it's the driest thing that i have ever tasted ever. Thankfully the rice (who can screw that up) and the sauce were amazing. Right after I tried wresting with the my first bite of the pork, the lady came rushing trying to tell me that she needs to replace my order. I asked why, i didnt understand but she must have mentioned "dry", "bad", "eww" i suppose. Thats all in my head of course but I just had to make sense with her rationale. It was replaced alright but I was hungry i had to eat half of my 3 sticks. The replacement was not dry as expected but it wasnt Noodle Company's Moo Ping (the best one ever!). I gave up, finished what I can and just left. It was a sad day for a dinner. The dinner gods must've been shedding tears for me.

Came here after lunch today for a coffee at the Sarnies outlet. Opted for the medium size cappuccino which was really very large. Coffee was about the right strength and temperature. Nice little design which I also like and friendly service. No issues getting a seat around 1.30pm.

Lunch crowd at Suntec is pretty heavy around 1 pm onwards. I ended up at PasarBella for the first time and trying out Thai food at Tamarind kitchen. Food is generally on the high side, and with sub-standard quality. Not worth for the price as I can cooked a much better tom yum soup.

We went here for dinner it was our first time expectations were high but if you have other options stay away from this place as the food sucks and are overpriced. The beef kebab was so dry you cannot taste of the beef and very hard to chew. The drinks are sold at 4.50 a cup for fresh lemonade mixed berries, it tasted like carbonated water with crushed berries no lemonade taste at all. The seafood stall is overpriced

Those who loves seafood, should try out the shell-out from the Cajun on Wheel (Pasarbella @ Suntec). The seafood are fresh. We had salted egg sauce and it was so yummy. Will definitely return for more and make sure the people ure gonna bring along are big eaters... hahaha... And one more thing, pls bring along with you tissues and lots and lots of wet tissues to clean your hands. Double Thumbs Up

Came to Pasarbella for the first time for lunch today and opted for one of the salads at Pimp My Salad, the Big Daddy. This includes various salad items and a stack of beef and pumpkin. Really quite tasty and worth another visit.
5
I love this Pasarbella at Suntec. A great variety of food to choose from. Outdoor seats available and the ambience is great!
4
Absolutely clean food and good service at Pimp My Salad. I love it so much and nearly be my Everyday food. Will see how long it lasts. They provide online booking and delivery too!

Vibrant spot with a nice variety of western food! My favourites are the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger and the Malted Chocolate Milkshake at Wolf Burgers.

For all louisiana way seafood lovers, this small foodcourt kind of multicuisine restaurant is a heaven.Apart from them, for the chicken and meat lovers among us, we have Mad Dogs chicken - just loved it, Wolf Burgers, Choo chicken, Pita & Olives - delicious rice and chicken palette. There are also drinks, desserts available at other kiosks.Located right in front of Fountain of Wealth at Suntec City, its a good choice and pretty affordable.

Can't remember the name of the store but they served rice bowl. Serving was small and tasteless. I think the salad that they served as sides tasted better than the mains. Pork belly had a (thick) layer of fats which melted in my mouth but had the sick feeling after that. Will never ever spend a single cent at this store.

Our group of 4 came here to try the popular Cajun on wheels seafood bucket. The price is pretty exorbitant, $180++ for a bucket of mixed seafood. The sauce was pretty spicy and seafood was average, nothing over the top. All in all an average experience with a big fat bill, reckon I could've gone for a better buffer with the $. Remember to grab a seat first as the seats are hot commodity cum dinner time.

Chanced about this ground floor food court recently .Tried Rollie Ollie (same owners apparently as Sarnies) Aloha Poke. Nothing to shout about. Pricey.Whilst waiting for the meal, tried the Cold Pressed Juice next door. Ordered a selection with Orange, Kiwi and Grape. And it tasted like ORANGE juice. Period.Disappointed.May not return.Got other Poke Bowls and Cold Pressed Juice joints to try

Spent a quick moment with the family while back and we ordered the Poseidon Meal with salted egg from the Crab Shack if I could recall. While the order took about 50mins to be prepared, wifey ordered a couple of spinach salad with hummus and kumara from another stall and it was the perfect appetisers. Once our order were ready, we dived into it without any delay. Make sure you ask for a mallet in order to crack those huge Sri Lankan Crab. It was worth the wait and as a family, we had a great time dining together. Only advise is come early to find seats as it is free seating. Would come back and recommend friends!

I'm here now sitting in Pasarbella after just having a slew of great and tasty foodThe Cajun bucket of Seafood is a must try if you have a few friends to share it with. Good food, a little bit expensive but quite worth the money.
4
Variety of street food to choose from. We tried the An An Vietnam Street Food. The beef noodle is unique and delicious. With spring roll and mango salad. Very healthy choice. Beef is tender and delicious. We will come back to try other outlet

I thought this would be effective where people in offices are. But no one expected the same high prices, with small portions. While it was interesting, with lots of vibe and noise, it was a tad bit too much!
4
I went to this for lunch today and ordered Beef Pastrami sandwich and pulled pork chili both were quite good. All meat were tender and well marinated.
The service was decent and little friendly.
4
There's a nice variety of cuisines to choose from here. It's good to visit PasarBella with others so you will be able to try a few dishes in a single visit. Although, if your group is big, it might be difficult to find seating.

Only tried cajun on wheels, rollie olie (to die for! :D), choo choo chicken, (& 2 more with names i can't recall) and all of them really good!!! price is not your normal hawker / food republic type but i'd say it's worth it. avoid peak hours as there's limited number of tables (i think they're planning on expanding to accommodate more
3
We tried Rollie Olie's Dos Amigos roll (unagi) ($14.95) and Cajun on Wheels' mixed seafood w/ 2 side dishes ($11.50). Rollie Olie sushi was really good while I thought cajun on wheels was mediocre and a little on the sinful side. Pasarbella is way too crowded and waiting time was really long. Probably will not visit again, but I wouldn't mind giving its Turf City branch a try.

This was my second visit to PasarBella Suntec. Tried the Wolf Burger! The bread, beef, veggie and cheese were a perfect combination!!! It wad supet yummy. The bread was toasted to perfection with a tint of burnt smell. We also tried the sushi at the Japanese stall. It was really yummy too and they had a lot of sauces to choose from other than the usual wasabi.Another dish that we have tried is the grilled chicken bowl with rice and egg. It was like Tori-Q but of cos nicer! Their salad taste fantastic too with a special sauce. Overall, I would definitely go back again! Next to try their salted egg fries and seafood platter at the seafood stall.

It was a nice place to dine with various choice of foods. We ordered a burger from wolf burger and pork ribs + baked potato from mad dogs. The burger was good but the rib wasn't my liking. The price of rib was overpriced. Will return and try other stalls such as Cajun on Wheels
4
There are some really good places here - especially Rollie Olie, the Vietnamese place, the sandwich shop slinging out house pastrami(!). Havent tried the others except for a HORRIBLE place - the middle eastern schwarma/kebab joint - Pita & Olives. Probably the worst food I have had in Singapore in 3+ years. THAT BAD
