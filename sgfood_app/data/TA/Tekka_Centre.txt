My family and I had great time and foods here. Lot food varities and delicious. Paid good value foods. Mutton curry, Naan, poori, masala and many more.
Can get chinese and thai cuisine too. Open till late night for supper after shopping.

Not to be rushed if you are shopping for clothes. If you are willing to spend the time then you can find something beautiful at a reasonable price.

Was in Singapore for a few nights. This hawker center is easy to find. Agree with other posters, it is not the cleanest place I have ever been. But it's a hawker food court so don't go in expecting anything beyond that. There was a stand for any type of Indian food you can imagine. Sampled multiple stands with a few friends without spending too much money at all. Honestly, I found Singapore to be a pretty 'vanilla' city... this was a better taste of local culture and definitely a highlight of my trip

A proper way to experience the local Indian market outside India. You can buy all your necessary needs from here from grocery to clothes to food. Cheap eats like the Nasi Biryani, South Indian delights like vadas, dosa, etc and much more. It's totally worth it to experience and witness the hustle and bustle which you don't come across everyday if you stay outside India. The smell of raw spices and Bollywood/South Indian music playing in the background while you can take a stroll enjoying a drink or having your meal is a great way to escape the Singaporean heat. Location wise its just couple mins away from the Little India MRT station. Overall the people are great, the prices are good and the food is amazin

Caught the train to Little India and got off at exit C. Follow the path through some shops and you will come to the Tekka Centre. It’s very close to the train station.I was a little concerned with the hygiene of this place it was very dirty. I have been to other hawker centres in Singapore and they were clean compared to this one. It was also a very hot and humid day which increased my concern and it turns out that my concerns were valid.There were 4 of us and we tried some egg an onion prati, dosa masala, butter chicken, vege biriyani (from Indian Cuisine vegetarian and non vegetarian) and duck rice. Everything was between 3-5 SDG so cheap but the food was average.I ordered a duck rice which was terrible so I didn’t eat much of it so I ate the vege biriyani. One of these meals gave me food poisoning. Not sure which one. Suspect it was the biriyani as I only had a few mouthfuls of the duck rice and didn’t like it cause it was full of bones. I love eating at Hawker Centres but this one is not worth the risk
4
I always visit the Tekka Centre for clothes whenever I'm in Singapore, however this is the first time I've eaten at their Hawker Centre on the lower floor.My daughter and I shared a mutton murtabak (S$8.00) and we each had a mango lassi (S$2.50 each).The murtabak was more than enough for two people and was a little too spicy for me, but then I'm not used to spicy food. The mango lassi was delicious.It was very hot inside the centre but the atmosphere was enjoyable and it was interesting to note what other people were eating.After our meal we went upstairs to where clothing and materials are sold and I bought 15 dresses
5
This is a place to try a little of everything. Very diverse in the selection of food everything from Chinese to Middle Eastern and Indian in between. It was a great foodie adventure. We started out with prawn noodles which was perfect then moved on to Indian cuisine. It was super busy and you have to hustle to get a table. Some stalls when come to you to take your order others are self service so you have to get your food first. Walk around and take your time to take it all in and come up with a plan. There is so much to choose from. Also most food hawkers don't sell drinks, there are hawker stands just for drinks, everything from fresh juices to beer. The best part is the price, the 2 of us eat until we couldn't eat any more, including drinks spend less then $20! Your money goes far and you get great quality food
4
The Tekka Center food hall is a great place to have all kinds of Indian (and other) food. I had a chicken biryani from Hanifa's Briyani and it was very tasty and only $5 SGD. If you like naan bread, and who doesn't, there is a place a few stalls down form Hanifa's that does plain naan bread for $1 SGD each. For anyone planning on going in early December they will be closed for 'Spring Cleaning' on the 4th/5th December (I think those were the dates
4
The Tekka Centre has an amazing range of real Indian food.Yes i have read the other review on here about how "unclean" or "unsafe feeling" this place is and i 100% disagree. My husband and i had a perfectly good, relaxed evening here trying different Indian foods, Having a few beers and one amazing Mango Lassi, and we spend less than $30 aud. It is worth the experience
5
As we visited Singapore, we ate almost everyday in one of the hawker food center. After visiting the Arab and the Indian quarter, we wanted return to the hotel, so on the way to MRT (train station) we found this center. As in other food markets, you can find here different Asian food. The Indian food was spicy, delicious and not expensive. Also the fruits and the squeezed juices we ate for the dessert were very testy.

Review by Dr Sim. Wide variety of food. No Air-conditioning. Basic ambience. Prata is good. Nasi Briyani is good. Tourists could visit as it is at the start of Little India. Regards Dr Sim
5
there are several places like this, don't just go to one. if your not sure which one to try just look for the longest lines and generally that will tell you which ones are the best.
5
Wanted to eat something traditional and found that place. It was very very delicious. Very traditional and fresh made. Great atmosphere and experience. Very cheap. Dinner with beer about 10 dollars
5
Such a great ambience place to have lunch with a bunch varieties. We choosed allauddin briyani as we saw the crowd was queueing for it. It was worth the price $5.50 we paid as the portion of chicken was big with rice and acar was equally given. Otherwise, there are alot of food to choose including rojak which was so tempting. There are also chinese stalls on the other side. A must-visit place in little india for those who came for singapore with budjet
5
Try : Prasanna's non veg ( 11:00 AM onwards) - excellent biryani, fish fry, chicken fry, Lot to choose from.Sky Lab's prawn vadai. Average, but something unique.Allauddin's Briyani - Excellent biryani. Avoid Zam Zam Muslim Food - Food is terrible and they cheat - the lady there overcharges on items that you are order, but are not listed on their menu. She charged me $4.50 for a kheema meat ball that was $1.50. Avoid like the plague
4
The hawker food stalls in Little India's Tekka Centre were good. Can't go wrong with classic Chicken Briyani. And if you need a traditional Indian dress... the upstairs market is LOADED with them and basically nothing else. Contrasted with Chinatown, there is more to choose from than traditional clothing
5
I love going to Tekka center and Tekka market. This is a great way to get a taste of the local cuisine. I always buy pratta sold in a couple of places at the center. Warning, pratta can be addictive! :o)You can also try kopi and fresh juices made right before you
5
I take food from more than one stall, but the Skylab stall is my "center". They make onion pakoras and drinks, like the mango juice and teh tarik I have with whatever I eat that morning. They are helpful and kind, like 7 years ago when I just had hip surgery, they brought my food to me. I am sorry that Tekka is closed again until after I am gone this trip, but will see them again next year
5
One of my favourite (and one of the cheapest) hawker centres in Singapore - although they are all clean and high-quality so it comes down to personal preference with the cuisines on offer. There are stalls from all over India. It's really good value, with an enormous dosa, naan, chai, and lassi for less than one USD each, and big portions of dhal for not much more. It's harder to find better vegetarian options anywhere else in the city, so just keep an eye out for the longest lines
3
Always ask the price of the food when in doubt, and make sure they give you what's stated on the price list. Eg. how many pieces of chicken. My friend has a recent experience of almost denying a piece of chicken on her chicken briyani. The seller only gave her a plate of rice and collected the money. Good thing she stand and waited and Asked for the chicken. Its a 'Y' brand shop. If you order mutton dish, make sure there is mutton meat and not just bones given to you.This place offers a good mix of local food, malay, india, and chinese. It will be an eye opener if you come from a place where there is no such food offerings. Food quality has gone down over the years, perhaps with inflation
5
One can be spoilt for food choices, there is plenty to eat in this bustling market. The only downside ir is very humid other than food is reasonably priced I will highly recommend buying food from John West stall and prata stall beside them.
4
a lot of food choices mostly Indian but on a very affordable prices.
many stall offer juices and milo dinosaur which seems to be a crowd favorite.
4
Located at Little India station. Plenty choices of Indian foods here, plus some Chinese and Malay food stalls. Ranging 5-8 dollar for main meal.
Briyani rice not that special but big portion.
3
This place is always busy with the people. Though it's nice for a quick food break and local shopping experience.
5
We ate breakfast there with our guide. Indian pancakes with your choice of toppings and a curry with it som sweet tea and extremely good fresh juice. Really good and cheap :)
4
I love to walk over to Tekka hawker stalls from my usual lodging place somewhere in the Bugis area (this time at the Strand Hotel - a nice value, by the way) to have some good Indian food at a great price. I usually try to catch some Roti Prata at breakfast time, and then sample various Indian foods / breads at other times. Today I an over there at 05:30 to have a bit of breakfast before my flight out - no problem getting my roti prata, but the nasi lemak Muslim stalls were not yet opened - though many maybe closed anyway for fasting ... Anyway, I've been visiting Tekka for 20 years, and will continue to eat there whenever I pass through Singapore
3
I went with my parents to this place on a weekday. Still it was extremely crowded. We had to wait 15 minutes only to get a seat.The shops were serving different cuisines, however they were not as clean as I would have liked. The smoke and smell coming from different stalls was making my parents uncomfortable. This May be due to the fact that our seat was right next to a stall.The food now, very difficult to find pure veg stalls, however you can customise food items as needed. My parents had dosa and wadak and it tasted good. I had a veg Mee Goreng and yeah taste wise was good.We finished it with Teh Tarik and Kopi.A good food, however not the greatest ambience. Will not return here again. Might come back just for takeaway Teh Tarik though
5
I love two things in life. Good value and curry. My god I love the Tekka center. In England I go to curry houses often because for me it is the world's best cuisine. Here you can completely indulge in all of its wonders at very cheap prices and some top quality food. The food culture here continues to astound me. I'm so happy.
4
Full of noise and goings on, a visit the Tekka Centre for the hawker food stalls and fresh fruit & markets is a way to join the locals. While the Centre looks poorly lit and uninviting, it is reasonable clean and the foods are safe to eat - and the aromas are enticing. There is an array of small Indian stalls selling different foods and drinks and the food we tasted were fresh, wholesome and cheap
4
Located next to the MRT stop for Little India we popped in to escape the ☔️ and grab a bite to eat. Compared to most of Singapores food markets it's a little rough round the edges and not clinically clean. Multiple of food options from the subcontinent available and v cheap. Opted for Punjabi place. Had tasty chana dhal and nice freshly made garlic naan. For quick and tasty food it's a good choice.
5
Great hawkers food centre, with an enormous choice. You can eat here easily for under $s10 a person, the biggest problem is the huge choice, I spent 30mins just deciding what to eat. Definitely a must visit.
5
Tekka Centre is located just beside Little India Mrt station (Downtown Line or Northeast Line). It's a fresh food market as well as a hawker centre. Being located in Little India, there's a large number of stalls selling Indian muslim food and Indian food.There are also stalls selling Chinese dishes. Recommend Skylab at #01-228 for the many types of vadai (savory fried donut) particularly the prawn vadai at 60 cents a piece. Prawn vadai is served with a whole green chilli, take a bite of the vadai and then a bite of the chilli. Opposite Skylab is the Sri Tiffin dosai stall at #01-224. Dosai (or Thosai) is a thin crispy crepe made with a fermented rice flour/dhal batter. Do try the masala dosai - a crepe stuffed with spiced potato filling. Usually served with a side of curry gravy. At $1.50, it's a cheap and filling snack. For a lighter snack, try the paper dosai. In many places in Singapore, dosai is only available for breakfast but at Sri Tiffn, dosai is available all day. Try an iced masala tea available from the many drinks stalls to accompany your snacks
5
For those who are not used to the variety of choices, the local hustle and bustle and the authenticity of a hawker food hall, this place may be daunting. Don't expect 'western-style' restaurants but be prepared to feast your eyes, ears and taste buds on an unmissable eating experience. Cheap and good quality food to be recommended. Guess what? Not a fly or bug to be seen
4
At the ground floor, there are wide range of Indian food especially mutarbak, nasi bryani, mutton soup at local hawker price. If you want to taste Indian food in Singapore Tekka is undeniably a good place to sample. The curry sauces are of a variety and appetising rich.At the upper floor, you see a wide range of hdb shops selling colorful Indian garment, sari and clothing.Tekka market has a long history and each time I am at Little India I would come and visit her. She is at Blk 665 Buffalo Road. You can take the MRT to Rochore or Little India
5
I find hawker centres very confusing and without a local or guide, hard to determine which are the good stalls. However, we saw an online review of Al Madina Food Corner (#01-266 green sign) which was fantastic. The family running it was super friendly and helpful suggesting (appropriate) amounts of food and side dishes. We had the chicken tikka, both garlic and plain naan (the garlic naan is amazing), a paneer dish and aloo gobi. All the food was flavourful and a great deal (maybe $s14 for 4 people). We also had mango lassi from Maya Mohan (no number but right nearby), also excellent.I wasn't as big a fan of Appam Specialist (#01-273 blue sign) which is around the corner. We only had the dessert but the crepes were premade and heated in a microwave and nothing special.It would be very helpful if people reviewing the hawker centres could add the names or numbers of the best stalls
5
Was wondering where to eat Indian for lunch when my friend mentioned this place. Glad we went here as it a vibrant place with many options for food Chinese, Indian, Muslim, . Was very cheap and very tasty- had a chickpea curry and nan from one of the many stalls. The masala tea was delicious . Came to 4.20 SGD! It was quite busy so you may need to share a table with somebody but it's a good chance to meet someone new. picked up some takeaway samosas and they have also been delicious. Will visit again

The Tekka Centre neighbours the Little India MRT which makes it a convenient place to eat when out and about.The centre itself looks a little run-down, much like the area it's in, but it was always clean.Most of the food on sale in this hawker centre is Indian, but there are other Asian stalls here including Chinese and Thai.Whilst it gets busier towards the latter part of the afternoon/early evening, it is also open during the day when it is quieter. It is worth noting that a number of the stalls here tend to close mid-evening which means it is not a suitable place to rely on if you are staying out late.The biryani we had here was unremarkable, but the food was cheap and dished up very quickly.The only tip I would give is for you to count your change - I had to chase up (not chase) a vendor for some of ours
5
The Tekka Food Court is worth a or even more visits! It seems to be very crowdy at first sight but once join the crowd, you will see the amazing variety of offers. You get every kind of indian food and fruit juices in the one part and can grab fruit or veggies in the other (market) part. Great food for great value - try it
5
We took shelter from a storm in the Tekka and were lucky to find a seat at a table in a thronging food court. We ordered chicken Biryani meals for four from one of the stalls and it was a great meal which with naan, sides and drinks came to less than S$20 . The quality of the food certainly was a very pleasant surprise. Just shows that there is plenty of good food to be had at very cheap prices in Singapore in the food courts. Highly recommended for food and all round experience.
3
This place is a jungle...you have to use descrimination in choosing your food. There are ratings for each shop, Ratings A and B are good and you can buy cheap food with really good quality. Forget shops rated C, you will definitely get a disease if you gamble eating in those places. Cheap and worth it for the discerning picker.Choose and eat at your own risk
3
All good and fresh and most of chef in Singapore they come and buy their fresh meat or chicken or vegetables from her
Many kind with nice prices
4
Very tasty food, very cheap. Marsala Dosai $1.80, biryani $3.50, roti pratha $2. Only complaint is that it's very hot & crowded. Close to MRT.
3
If you were to feel like being in India (while in Singapore) this is the place to visit. Food, Dress materials and the whole atmosphere.
4
If you are hungry and Looking for a Great food and cheaper food? This place is for you ;-) We stayed at Little India our hotel is couple blocks from this place so we ate here twice and Their food is Delicious!
5
The mutton prata was fantastic the pricing was brilliant and if any hawker stall should get a Michelin star it is these guys
5
Want to cook quality food for a bunch of friends & get the freshest groceries, seafood, chicken or goat / assorted meats at a solid price? Shop at Tekka. You will not find better priced meat & produce in Singapore. Period. I always go here to buy my groceries. Always.
5
Chicken biryani from some of the stalls is exceptionally good, but it is well worth trying other types of food here. Thai, chinese, indonesian, malaysian, european, sandwiches, fruit juices - you could probably eat here for a year and be able to have a different dish every day. $5 dollars for a meal, good value in this day and age. You can also buy cold beers. Freshly squeezed sugar cane with lemon and ginger was especially refreshing
3
I'm only here for the Indian Rojak, which I'll pack on my way home. This Indian Rojak stall has been around for a long time and has the best sauce and prawn fritters, in my book. This place to too crowded in the evening and even worse in the weekends. Many options for Indian food like prata, dosa... And many dishes that you don't get in other parts of Singapore
1
Had my lunch at Tekka foot court. That place is dirty, humid and people around can be intimidating for females. We walked around after lunch for about 10 minutes and decided that was enough for the experience. If you know what you'll get, then it's fine. Otherwise, not worth it
4
A lovely bustling place, rightly called Little India appearing as if all the Indians on the island came down to this place. There's a lot in Tekka Centre with Wet market shops, Shopping stalls and the most acclaimed food court. The real kopitiams of Singapore. You find a lot of variety of shops with Indian food, Muslim Food and Chinese as well. We visited Shan-e-Punjab and tried the minimeal set - lunch with rice and chole, beans, gobi, dal makhani which was good and accompanied with Sugarcane juice. Sometimes it might get a little uncomfortable with no AC but with much cheaper price one can't ask for more.All in all a must visit for budget travellers and who venture to try different cuisines
5
Visited about 5 different stalls and shared a great meal. Amazing flavours and quality at very cheap prices
4
A food court with many different types of Asian food. Like everywhere in Singapore it's nice and clean.
It's a place where the locals eat so it must be good.
3
This place is not very clean and is very crowded , but if you are looking for Clothing + Food for cheap this is the place. Not a great ambiance, but everything is available in this mall.
4
In here , you can get all you need under one roof Wet market ;Fresh seafood, good quality and not expensive Fresh meat Fresh fruit , many tropical fruit and western fruit as well Fresh vegetable and some of them I can't find in supermarket I can find all sort of food may not available in supermarket .Dry area : place to find Indian cloths, change your watch battery here, traditional cooking tools also available hereFood court : so many to pick, Indian, Malay, Chinese and Western .cso many good food stall here with affordable price 
4
This place in little India has mostly tasty Indian food which is well priced. It's a little warm in there and whilst being obvious tourists looking at the stalls, we had a lot of stall owners shouting things at us like 'banana fritter', 'bhaji' so decided not to eat at these stalls but the ones which were obviously popular with huge queues
4
This food ( hawker) centre is located in Little India. Naturally, you would expect to find wide choices of good Indian food here. And at cheap prices, compared to food courts. And definitely taste are much much better here.The food centre is sort of divided into 2 sections- one Indian/Muslim food & other Chinese food.For the widest choices & good choices of 'hawker Indian food, there is no better place than here. Popular Indian food here that one must try includes Roti Prata ( bread dough with different types of toppings/add-ons) & Nasi Briyani ( yellow rice with either chicken, fish or mutton).This centre also houses a wet market( besides the Indian food section) & sundries/general items stalls on 2nd floor.The Little India MRT station is located just below Tekka Centre ( via NE & DTL).Don't miss trying the Indian food here
3
Initially we avoided the place being Muslim dominated with everything non-veg. Later we found that one row of shops is South Indian vegetarian food. We also found that shops in this row sold Dosas, Vadas, Idly, etc. and was very reasonably priced; in fact cheapest in Singapore, although cleanliness level was average. One vendor, whom we asked to pack Vadas for our visit to Night Safari, we learnt that he did not have the coconut chutney with Vadaas ( a must for South Indian Food). Preparation was avearage, not as good as at Komalas but much cheaper. Don't expect North Indian food here
4
Found this place after wandering around and was delighted to be in a more traditional setting. The food is more indian in this place (little india of course!!) but it is very tasty. However, there are some shops which are not so malay inspired indian food but are more mainland india inspired food i.e. dal/lentils etc. The beverages are absolutely stunning and you must try the chendol at one of the stall. It is simply amazing!!
4
Its a hawker center / food court type. So expect alot of crowd, do not expect great ambience. Cleanliness is ok. Reasonable price per Singapore hawker center standards. Do not indulge in too much of food if you are new to hawker center food, as most of dishes here have applied generous amount of oil. Choose wisely
4
I've always wanted to try 'street food' in Singapore & loved this experience. The common tables are totally no frills & at first it could all look a bit daunting if not used to Asia. But the stall holders & most other diners were generally very helpful & spoke enough English to communicate. I was actually quite surprised to see very few tourists there. The only ones were at the Allauddin Biryani Bar - perhaps because it was on a variety of tourist websites? Or because it was the closest to the entrance?!I'm sure it's a very nice place, but pretty much all the other stalls deserve custom too!It's certainly not classy food & the mutton can be a bit tough & Bonney. But it tastes authentic, satisfying & is remarkably cheap : between SGD 3-5:50 per plate. We loved the biryanis, Naans & chicken masalas, plus the cheese & egg prata (paratha) made-to-order for breakfast. Our tea masalas and lime & salty Lassis were also better than in any 'proper' restaurant. Next time we're going to try the crispy donut-like vadais and the more Singaporean/ Chinese style dishes!
3
Being a vegetarian I found so many options to choose from (which I found difficult in many other places). However the place is too crowded (i visited on a Saturday)
4
I like this place for eat. It's very typical and lot of differents food and drinks.
Big plate for cheap price!
5
This was a dream come true for me. So many stalls each with a slightly different specialty. I focused mainly on the Indian food, but there's plenty of Chinese and other ethnic foods to be found.In such an expensive city, I ate a huge lunch for the equivalent of only a few dollars (US). It was all delicious and if I wasn't full, I would have stayed and tried some of the specialties from every stall! Can't wait to go back
3
I have given this centre the stars more for the atmosphere than the food.It is a great place to watch.If your hungry and insist on eating here it can be pretty chaotic at busy times. (Which seems to be all day especially Saturdays and Sunday's) Don't expect classic Indian cooking here There is also a wet market and clothing market in the same buildin
5
I'm currently in Singapore and have quickly noticed, compared to the rest of SE Asia, it is incredibly expensive. As someone who is travelling around the world and therefore on a budget eating out in fancy restaurants just isn't an option. Even my hostel restaurant is pretty pricey. The Tekka Centre has been the answer to my prayers! Based in the Little India area of Singapore I've been able to buy huge portions of Chicken/Mutton Byriani for only $5. The food is extremely tasty and, if you're someone like me who only eats one meal a day, will keep you full throughout the night and into the next day! Would highly recommend visiting if you're on a budget but still want to eat great tasting food! Please note: The Tekka Centre is essentially a hawker centre. Lots of different stalls and an open seating area. Very much a no frills kind of place however the food is great!
4
Tekka Hawker centre is located adjacent to Little India MRT station, it got new look and decent distribution of tables when it was renovated few of years ago. I have been to Little India few hundred times for different reasons like groceries, dinner but I never dare to get into this hawker centre as I used to assume that atmosphere doesn't look good, not hygiene but a week ago one of friends took me there for lunch to try especially Biriyani, that incident gave chance go around all stalls, that visit completely changed my view on this hawker centre, it is like any other hawker centres in Singapore, more number of tables, more varieties, low in price and tasty food.Since there are many stalls and they sell similar food, there is huge competition between them thus they try to get attention from walk-in customer, by calling them softly. No loud calls, no hard selling nothing, it was quite descent. I tried mutton Biriyani from one of the stalls, it was package with mutton biriyani+hard boiled egg with curry gravy and cucumber side dish. I agree that it was not made from high quality basmathi rice due to the cost, but taste is as good as good quality basmathi rice. Quantity was perfect. I enjoyed the biriyani, I am planning to take my family in coming weeks for lunch or dinner. Suggestion: Avoid going on weekends as many workers from Indian subcontinent gather their during weekend, they don't trouble you but queue will be bigger and getting a table will be difficult
3
You can eat from S$2 onwards for a simple meal or more sumptous meals. The Indian Duck Curry with rice at Zam Zam at the end of the 1st row is really nice. I have patronise this stall foor many years. Many stalls here serve good briyani but modified to more Tamil Nadu taste. Also available different from these briyani are Alauddin's Briyani and his neighbour the North Indian briyani. heir chutneys are really nice. The tea stalls from most of the stalls are about the same but if you do not want much sugar you need to emphasise to them. I usually go for teh see. THis is usually with unsweetened eveporated milk with little sugar. The Cha Kway Teow stall more on the inner side served by the elderly uncle is also nice. He will also prepare it to your choice without pork he all time favourite prata stall is by the Haji on the 3rd row from the main entrance on the left facing the open court. He has been there for ages with his wife. Only Malay prata stall which serves with sambal. Soft and nice sumptous prata that almost melt in your mouth. The dough is made by himself and not from the ready made as used by more prata stalls. The vadai (indian spicy donut) from Skylab on the 1st row 3rd shop owned by Aunt Mary is the best. The quality is good but small and tasty. I could just go on and recommend many more stalls but the few good food stalls which I frequent coz of the quality of food is in this write up. For travellers this is a good place for cheap eastern and western food
5
Tekka centre is at little India metro station. It is simply a market. At upper floors clothings etc was available and on ground floor natural produce is available including fruits vegetable meat poultry & fresh sea food including fish prawns cray fish squids mussles lobsters etc.I love to visit the fresh produce markets of the cities where ever I go.There is a section of hawkers outlets of famous Singapore street food and I loved it. There is halal and non halal section. The food was excillent in taste portion and very cheap just around sin $5 to sin $8 each. You could taste Indian Malaysian Thai or Chinese dishes. Juices slush chilled drinks are also available at colourful stalls to beat the heat. The food is hygienically cooked as Singapore is very clean and health concious.Overall experience was good.
5
I always go to Pak Kashmiri Stale number #01-250 for my indian meal. Simply the best Garlic naan I have ever tasted even better than the OVER priced Song of India on Scotts road.I had chicken tikka and my word!! my mouth went back to Frantzen's restaurant in sweden. The flavour was amazing. A great balance of sourness that went well with the mint and the onions on the white plates. I just had to order a second plate. Great value for money, really great value.Sometimes I have mutton or daal and it is spicy and hot so enjoy.Drinks are delivered as the hawkers walk around asking
4
Lovely place to find Indian specialities like Sup Tulang, but come early, we first tried in the evening and every stall said just 'finished' ... maybe not the most clean of all the centers we visited, but big hand-wash station at the entrance. Toward the rear you will get a whiff of the meat market next door. Lots of choices and cheap prices. Also idea for a stroll in Little India afterward
3
Many places to explore Indian cuisine and shopping for clothes, toiletries, fruits, fish, etc. It can be quite crowded during the weekends. My colleague told me she bought papaya soap for her face here and it keeps your face radiant.
4
This place sums up all the food available in Singapore. Indian Chinese Muslim food are found under one roof at affordable price!
4
I went to Tekka Centre a few times with my friends (we tried different "restaurants" there) and we always enjoyed our food.
It can be crowded and hectic sometimes, but it's very cheap (1-5$)
4
What a place: hot and crowded, lots of strong aromas floating in the air, and delicious local (=Indian and Malaysian) food with VERY economical prices. This is what I call authentic!
4
We wanted to try a hawker center, and Tekka in Little India was recommended. There were stalls representing most of the cultures in Singapore. We had a meal from Nasreen Muslim Food stall, but there were many similar ones. I had a mutton chop. I think my husband had Mee Goreng. We sat at a round table by the stall, and the plates were brought over. This is a hawker center, and essentially street food, so you have to be prepared for the heat, the crowd, the throwaway plates, and somewhat messy place. But we had a lot of fun, and the food was decent

If your in a budget or are after the "local" experience the. This is the place for a very cheap meal. $5 will buy you a substantial Biriayni add a Mango Lassi for $1.50. BUT dont expect a plate your food comes on a tray covered in paper and a plastic spoon. Seating us communal and there is every chance of getting in to a conversation with your fellow diners. It's chaos it's mad it's great

Ate at the Tekka centre a few times. Mainly for breakfast. There is a stall selling western breakfast. It is the second aisle in from the Rochor Canal Road side of the building. You could get most things for between S$2-3 so between Â£1-1.50. Brilliant value for money. Lovely couple who run it too. Returned to eat Indian style one evening. We are westerners, so our Indian food is a fairly dumbed down version of the authentic, so we found even a normally Tikka Masala to be fairly hot, so hot it had shall we see a slightly more undesirable affect. Nothing to do with hygiene. Yes it is a bit tired looking, but most vendor's have their hygiene accreditation on show and the stalls are so small you can see the prep area's. I put my experience down to not being used to the truly authentic dishes I ate. The drink stall with the rose milk will help if your food it too spicy. If you visit Singapore on a budget like we did, then try the hawker centre's for your meals. They are insanely cheap. Just like giant food courts with communal dining. Good idea is, if not everyone in your party like the same thing, you can still eat together. Just order your food at a stall of your own choosing. Brilliant idea

This was a jam packed place and the only place in guessing in Singapore that has food available for S$1U have all the varieties hereAnd halal and non halal separate so that was good!Certain shops had better food than othersAnd the drink stalls pretty good tooAll in all cheap and good place for biriyani pararta nasigorang et
5
This place is at the end of Sarangoon Road or just next to Little India MRT. Went there in the morning 8:00 am on few days, great Indian south Indian stalls at the entrance and many more local, Malay food stalls selling hot and delicious food.I didn't have breakfast, as i was doing my morning walk.Some of the reviews say it was dirty, i found the place to be very clean. Of course in hot weather u may like to sit inside and AC restaurant. Breakfast here was 2-4 SD, same was 3-6 SD in an AC restaurant

After looking around the market we found ourselves in the hawker centre. There was so many stalls to choose from it was hard to decide where to eat. At times like this I stop trying to select and just go for somewhere fairly decent and opt for any appealing dish. The food was pleasant, quickly served and cheap so a good experience.We then went to see what exotic drinks we could find and got some orange juice, a sugar cane, a milo dinosaur, a lemon tea and a coconut. All good.We couldn't get the five of us around the table but I spyed a stack of plastic chairs under an adjacent table so went to get one. It seems the chairs were being watched full time by another old Chinese stall holder who appeared at the speed of light to fight me for possession. He of course won and relayed his victory to his old crone who turned to stare at me as the "Chinese victory over the English" story was recounted. Another of life's great experiences to bore the grandchildren with when I'm older
4
Lots of variety tried mee goreng and soup Kam bing was quite good but disliked the disposal used to serve the food.Any way it was cheap and over crowded.
4
Cheap and authentic Indian food customize to Singaporean taste bud. They have the best of thosai, prata & teh tarik. 👍👍👍
4
If you are looking for a cheap but delicious meal, head to the Tekka Cetnre, in the heart of Little India, mere steps from the MRT stop. Fresh ingredients, made to order, the hawker centre is a cluster of food stalls. There are a few other varieties of food, but it is predominantly Indian cuisine. Next to the food stalls is the fresh fruit, vegetable, meat and fish market as well as textiles upstairs
5
Had a much better experience here than at the Newton Food Center, where the hawkers are very aggressive. Here, we were able to look at the stalls we were interested in and ask questions without being hassled. We settled on a stall called Deen's Nav Tandoor run by a husband and wife team. It was fantastic! I had chicken tikka and garlic naan and my husband had the chicken tandoor. We watched him roll out the naan and make it from scratch. They had other dishes that were clearly homemade out on display in the casserole dish. We only ate one meal here on our last day but would have loved to try other stalls
4
If you have time to spend, there are plenty of non-edibles to buy. But my purpose here was to indulge in some authentic Mamak food. True enough, all my cravings were satisfied to the max. Great place for a decent meal! The prata was only 80 cents
4
The Tekka centre is the place to go if your a backpacker on a budget and fancy some delicious food for just a few dollar bills! The atmosphere is great - bustling and hot. Prepare to get your sweat on as you enjoy your spicy curry! The place is full of locals enjoying the great selection of foods - it's always a good sign if the locals are queuing for the stand! My boyfriend enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and naan and I enjoyed the vegetarian options - chickpea curry, spinach and cottage cheese paneer, aloo gobi and a traditional daal. I asked for a mix of all four dishes it was only $4. $1 a dish!! Freshly cooked clay pot Naan breads only $1! Great if your trying to save in Singapore - definitely give it a try.
3
Dominated by Indian people and so many foods to choose, kwetiaw, briyani rice, hainam rice, noodle, etc.If you stay near little india or looking for a cheap variety of foods, you can give it a try, or else it's not worth it because overall the taste is standard
4
Indians flock here everyday because there is a wide variety of Indian food at prices that are half what you would pay at most budget Indian restaurants in SingaporeYakader, Allaudin, Hanifa and a few other stalls sell good dum briyani for S$5 for a rather filling portion. There are a few tandoor stalls where a naan only costs $1. Dosas, idly etc are also available from $1.Ambience is - well,,, the place is hot, with cooking smells, a little dirty, noisy, after all it is a food market. If you have a sensitive stomach, it may be best to avoid it. The exact opposite of fine dining
4
We visit the centre on our trip to Little India. We went there by bus, boarding at a bus stop a few steps from our hotel and alight right in front of Tekka centre.It was like a wet market on the ground floor, inside in the middle. In front and spread to the left deep to the back was the food court, mainly Indian but other cultural food available as well. Very crowded, very hot, all eating and talking. We did not eat there as we already planned to eat at the Blue Diamond Restaurant nearby.On the next level, level 1, was for fabric, clothes and tailors. They were mainly Indian. It was so colorful and one had a feeling of fear of being swallowed by those hundred of thousand of fabric snakes intertwined from top to bottom while one making way through them stalls.We also visited the fruit stalls and bough some fresh jack fruit for our dessert after lunch. $2 SG a small bag and $3 a bigger one. Other fruits were cut up and sold in bags as well.Surrounding Tekka were shops of different proportion. One was a stand out, jewellery shops so attractive with gold jewelries decorated shelves with hardly any gaps left. Most were Indian buyers served by Chinese shop assistants
4
An incredible selection of indian food served from dozens of stalls in an indoor hawkers market. Very cheap and delicious - the only hard part being what to choose! You sit on communal tables after choosing your food, although there is table service for drinks. We got here just before six after which it started to fill up quickly. It's a market so it's not pristine, but i'd disagree with reviewers who say it's dirty - the cooking areas of the stalls looked well taken care of. Take a walk through the adjacent fresh fish and meat market if you can stand the smell.
5
mainly Indian selections, but plenty of other options. Amazingly cheap, smells will drive you crazy with hunger. Vegetarian dishes available. Drinks, fresh fruit and desserts available.
5
Had breakfast and lunch at the Tekka Centre. Find a seat, and select whatever dishes and drinks you want from the multitude of street hawkers. Great authentic Indian and Chinese food freshly cooked in front of your eyes. Don't leave Singapore without eating here!
4
The Tekka Center offers a broad range of cuisines (including Middle Easten, Indian, Malay and Chinese) in a sprawling, airy and roofed complex. During lunchtime, the place was full of locals and a scattering of tourists.
4
Went here a couple of times during our 2 week holiday in Singapore. All the food we tried was excellent.
4
Lots of options here, although vegetarian is limited... there were veggie places, but just very few of them... tried a few different things from different vendors and everything was fab :-)Great street food, great prices and definitely worth a visit - we'll be going back soon :-
4
Little India isn't really all that big, so if you're a tourist and looking around, I'd recommend walking into Tekka Centre. The bottom floor is a food court and small market. I haven't eaten here as we have a food court at home and this food looked very similar. I'm a foodie and tend to visit "famous" hawker stalls or else restaurants...there's simply too much food in Singapore to be eating everywhere!! The upstairs sells clothes, shoes and even "antiques". The clothes consist of saris and salwar kameez at cheap prices so if you're into that sort of thing, it's a good place to look. There are sari shops elsewhere in Little India but they are of higher quality and more expensive. They have a lot of cute kids clothes up here too. This place isn't a must see and it's not air conditioned, but if you're looking to see something besides gold and sari shops, take a look around
5
You hear a lot about "Hawker Food" in Singapore. It's street food moved off the street and into the markets. It's not fancy, just good food, served in reasonable portions in a great ambiance.Tekka Centre has one of the best Hawker Food centres in Singapore. The market serves Little India, so most of the food stalls serve Indian food but there's also some Malay food in the centre. Most things are very reasonably priced, around $5.00 US for entres. You order from a vendor and take a seat and he or she will bring your order to your table. It's best to go for lunch or an early dinner since the food stalls start to shut down around 5PM. Tekke Centre itself is also a lively wet market best seen in the morning. It's easy to spend some time wandering the market then stopping at the hawker stalls for lunch.
4
We experienced Indian for breakfast with the local people & not one tourist in sight except for ourselves. It looks untidy, however it's just old. All the stores have a clean/food hygiene rating up to be seen. Be sure to have 20cent coins on you to buy toilet paper from the vending machines. Glad we went
5
We come here many times during our holiday in Singapore. True, it is hot and humid but there are a lot of fans to try to provide a cooling effect. With air conditioning, this place would lose something of it's character. The food stalls all display a cleanliness rating with A being the best.My wife watched the ladies at Lim Kee Cooked Food (01-323) cleaning their stall the first time we came and was so impressed the next time we came she had the Wanton Noodle and has been eating it ever since and we always have a beer at the stall next door.I have had the biriani at a few stalls without any bad effect
3
Located close to Small India. This is a place to experience both Singapore food and India food at low cost. Also also have a look of market place in India fashion. The only drawback is it is not air conditioned. It turns one sweaty with hot and spicy India food
2
I'm a confirmed foodie but couldn't bring myself to eat in this very unhygienic, uncomfortable jumble of tables in sweltering heat and humidity. For those a bit more daring or accustomed to same, the variety of Indian food at the stalls is amazing.
5
Best place to try food in this place when in singapore.all affordable foods great indian food at affordable price.wide selection....
4
This place is very busy but well worth the visit. Downstairs are the myriad of foods stalls (chinese/indian/thai) and upstairs are market stalls. You select what you want from the stalls and then sit at the communal seating. Fantastic value.
5
I like this place very much. Can choose so many food . Can buy from many food shops and the taste is soo good. I come here every night for dinner and choose different food everytime. Good. I recommend.
3
It is messy, unhygenic and yet has its own flavors and wide variety of food. A typical tourist will certainly love the place with so many of its offerings and at reasonable prices.From Biryanis, to Parathas, to Dosa`s to Vadas to Samosas and Pakoras, all go for less then S$2. Top it up with Masala chai or fresh juices or coffee.Do not forget to try the Dal Vadas , but choose the ones, freshly out of kadai, hot and spicy.The place is always full and vibrant.Must visit area for a change 
5
We stopped here for a quick bite to eat before exploring little India and had an excellent biryani- unctuous gravy, lamb as soft as butter. Chose by going to the stand with the longest queue. We also grabbed a couple of hot masala teas and a ginger tea which went a long way to making us feel human again after hitting Clarke Quay the night before. A sociable, good value and fun place to eat.
4
Loved the food, went back here a few times. Our hotel was around the corner so we picked up 'Masala chai' every evening. The 'Mango lassi' in the corner shop is to die for. A big shame are the unhygienic circumstances. Tables are dirty, floor is dirty, hate to say it, but it really felt like India
4
Adjacent to a market the Tekka centre is a busy Indian food hall. Loads of different foods from the sub-continent just browse the different menus each stall has displayed, sit down at the communal dining area and they'll bring your food to you. We ate from a Kashmiri stall, pretty good curries and a lovely fresh naan! Another guy floats around from a drinks stall, we got 2 great tea masalas to go with our meal. Very rustic, some might say 'rough n ready' but give it a try if you like Indian food
4
We can find many halal food here. Cendol durian and rojak is the best. There are also Chinese food here. The most important is, this place is just right at the corner of MRT station. 5minutes walking and you'll find this one stop shopping place. You can find many India's clothing at the 2nd floor.
5
Just outside Little India MRT station this is a hawker centre with lots of high quality food stalls. Very cheap and lots of choices, good for family and/or fast dining and because the turnover is so regular you are fairly safe. It is possible to get a beer, but only on one side of the centre and you need to sit there to drink it
4
Alluadin biryani was good food,chicken massala butter chicken,2 garlic naan,2 large rice,2 pieces tandoori chicken 26S$ beautiful taste!must agree with previous punter,cleanliness in actual eating areas left a lot to be desired but food was excellent
4
Delicious... One word to describe Allaudin biryani
Must try.... Good price with a restaurant taste..
2
Seemed the most unkept of all the Hawker centers-dirty and overly busy at lunch. Food was below average. Skip it and go to the Vegetarian restaurant Komal near by.
4
Tekka Market food centre is located near the head of serangoon road. The food centre boats a number of local cuisines. The one I like is the north indian cuisine food centre Pak Kashmiri delights. The food veg/non-veg are both very good in taste and the price is equally cheap. The best place to have cheap good indian food in Singapore
4
Went to Tekka tonight to experience the proper hawkers market food abd wssnt dissappointed. Chicken biryani with pupadam and a drink for $S 6- about Â£4. The other local tourist reataurants are charging twice this. Sat at a table with total strangers who struck up a conversation with me and had a great time talking to them about the real Singapore.
4
The last couple times I was in Singapore, Tekka center was closed for renovation. This time round it is opened. I won't miss the chance to visit and eat yummy curry! Tekka center is a combination of fresh (wet market) and hawker center. Although it's in Little India, there are also chinese and Malay food. I ordered roasted duck rice and chicken briyani. Both tastes awesome. And the beancurd! The location is very convenient too. Just a few step away from Little India MRT. I'll definitely visit again.
5
For anybody who loves good Indian food, Tekka centre is the place to visit in Singapore. Actually, everywhere in Little India is pretty great, but at this hawker centre there is so much variety, so no matter what kind of Indian food you are after you will be able to find it at a cheap price. 100% recommended
5
We set out to Little India, notably the hawker market there and we were not disappointed. The food was excellent, a stall called SJ Tandoori was amazing. The curries were great, especially the chicken biryani and the butter chicken and the garlic nan was so good, we had to order another one. And the best bit, the price, $11 for the lot including dal, I think that this is really hard to beat
5
Great hawker fayre once again, and being in Little India it is obviously more Indian food although there are some Chinesse food stalls too. Quality varies from good to great, so you as I did really have to eat here a few times!SJ Tandoori #1-218 was my favourite
4
The Tekka Centre is dirty, old and like a flea market straight out of Mumbai... But that's what you expect out of a Hawker Centre with a twist. There is food from all parts of the world such as India, Malaysia, Chinese and even Taiwan. The Biryani is a must! The most exquisite freshly made chicken Biryani claimed to be the 'world's best' for a mear $S4.50. Yes you won't get the leisure of air conditioning and clean table and chairs, but what you will get is a genuine experience of a flea market with 90% of locals digging into their lunch. Strongly suggest you jump on the MRT and wonder down for a bite to eat around noon and experience what Little India has to offer.
4
Don't miss the Allauddin beriani! I loved their curry however the centre require new facade. In term of cleanliness I give 3 out of 5.
4
Enjoyed great Briyani followed by a Pratha for dessert. Follow the big queues and you can't go wrong. Fun Indian fashion shopping upstairs too.
5
Singapore's renowned food centres are, at first sight, rather intimidating. Bodies everywhere. Noise. Colours. Cooking aromas. But be reassured - each of the many food outlets has to have a government certificate of cleanliness in order to remain open and so the food is clean, safe ...and tastes like heaven! Find a seat - sharing a table is perfectly acceptable and a lot of fun! - and mark it as taken with a packet of paper tissues (useful after your meal!) then simply go and find something that takes your fancy, talk to the stall holder and buy! They will cook fresh naan bread to order and your curry or noodle choice will be the taste experience of a lifetime! And all for just a few SG$. Note - alcohol is not served everywhere - but stallholders will come to you offering bottled water or soft drinks. Don't be shy - just go for it! You won't regret it

Tekka Centre is near to Sim Lim Square Building (Selling Electronic stuffs) and little india. The nearest MRT to get to tekka centre is 'Bugis MRT station'. Its about 15-20 mins by foot to get to tekka centre. Its a pretty unique place where you can spend about 2-3 hours (the most) for a quick visit. Level one are mostly food sold by indians, malays and chinese. Proceed to level 2 for cheap and nice saris. Usually i will patronise stalls, #01-234, #01-257, #01-258 for their good food. I would recommend these stalls as i feel they are consider pretty good and cheap. Do try a indian prata called 'Plaster prata'. Its looked like usual normal prata except it comes with a sunny side up. I will break the yolk and let it soak up my prata and dip it into the curry. (Note: its usually not listed in the menu and subjected from stall to stall). If you are interested, you may get it from #01-258 and it cost less than S$ 2 for a piece (Sorry for the lack of photo)
3
This hawker food area in Little India is a bit dirty and very chaotic. But the Indian food is good enough that there were lines at many of the stalls. We tried the cheese/egg prata and the egg/onion parta at Ah-Rahman Royal Prata, stall number 01-248. The paper thin dough is twirled and stretched and then fillings are added before it is folded and placed on a hot griddle. It was okay, the sauce next to it in a small cup is similar to the one that accompanies a dosa. But the best part was watching the old guy manipulate the dough and smear the eggs around with his fingers.
5
Having spent a morning exploring the delights of Little India and Kampong Glam we stumbled upon the Tekka Centre almost by accident. While the building is unprepossessing, the hubbub inside can't fail to raise a passing interest and it's a brilliant lunch stop. Mutton biryani got the popular vote and served up in a flash was melt in the mouth delicious. But the biggest revelation was the accompanying order of ginger tea. Even the coffee and beer drinkers amongst our group were instantly won over. Definitely worth a detour if it's not already on your Singapore itinerary, lunch at the Tekka Centre was probably one of the best and most memorable meals of our 3 week trip to Australasia

The real cachophony, every kind of person, varities of food, abundant jewellery shops, eateries, clothings, general merchandise and on top of it all, buses, cars and all teh otehr moving transport that will halt, when you cross ther road, that still has red signal, but grenn signal for the transport to stop and yet it all goes smooth as a butter. Welcome to Little India and enjoy the CHAOS.Getting There: Little India MRT station from any corner of singapore
4
There is more than just curry briyani and prata to Tekka Centre. This less-noticed food centre packs a gem for the stalls that sell Thai, Chinese (Sliced fish soup and braised duck rice) and Japanese Food. When in Singapore, do it the local way. Join the locals in their queues, and you won't go wrong. Pair your meal with a cup of fresh fruit juice - my favourite is the ABC juice (Apple, Beetroot & Carrot) for a refreshing and healthy concoction.The prices here are cheaper than the food courts - most main courses would not set you past S$4. There are washing basins around the hawker centre, while toilet entries will set you back 10 cents.Dining at a hawker centre is a must-do activity to experience authentic Singapore. Take note that this place closes by evening time daily
4
The location is good so after a long day of shopping and wandering you can get to have some good hot Indian dishes as well as others. The preparations are a bit spicy and hot so the children did not enjoy the dishes we ordered but when we ordered without chilli they enjoyed too. You can also go around the place as lot of shops are there
4
For Indonesian, rice is the main food. So I really excited when found indian restaurant in here. The most fav menu is briyani, mutton and masalah. The taste of Indian food sometimes similar with indonesian food. Spicy and use many ingredients. I choiced chicken briyani then got two big slices of chicken in my plate. The porsion so big and the taste is yummy. Don't forget to drink 'teh tarik' in the last time. It is so perfect
5
Fantastic recommend visit! Had delicious food worth the 80 cents I paid for dinner- so cheap! I didn't find it dirty rather ethnic & cultural!!
4
I've not bought anything here,but the cab driver told me the goods sold here reasonable priced.
3
it's a bit dirty here, unlike the other famous hawker center at singapore. but if you're a fan of indian food, you have to come here. the biryani rice, tulang merah and sup kambing is excellent.
2
being an indian myself, i expected a lot of ethnicity and aroma in this market located in the heart of little India but was totally disappointed as i just could not find anything interesting here. Only clothes stores and hawker stalls around.
1
Couldn't find the entrance for quite a while. The place looks like a shipping warehouse.
5
I use the market at the Tekka Centre on a weekly basis. My favourite stall is Mr Chuis for vedgetables, its at the back of the food market beyond the meat and fish. He sells great fresh procuce as well as a few treats such as porchini mushrooms, rocket and truffle oil. Next to this stand is the best place to get orchids from in Singapore, from the chinese uncle there. On the food side is a western stall that does fry ups, even french toast for $1.80, order a fresh juice from the stall oposite and relax... its a must for all my guests who come to stay from over seas.
5
When one enters, one is hit by all the aroma of spices and local food fare. All the colors and the melange of cultures together.In the wet market, vegetables and fishes are all so fresh. Here is the place for a visitor to Singapore to have an insight into the real local life of Singapore. Something not to be misse
5
Allahuddins.Always visit when in Singapore. Must be the best hawker centre biryani on the island. I usually arrive before 11.30. After that time the queue is out the centre as locals arrive to order their lunchtime takeaway meal.You will have no problem finding the stall. Just look for the longest queue
4
busy, bustling noisy and full of local life. We had the Paratha, egg and onion and a garlic one with a little mutton curry and lentil curry. absolutely wonderful as always.Very friendly stall holders eager to please and help along those who are obviously not locals. We regularly get warned to "watch your wallet around here" by the taxi drivers when in Little India, which is a fair warning anywhere, but having said that I have never experienced or seen any problems. (which doesn't mean they don't exist)This still one of my favourite parts of Singapor
5
Absolutely loved this place. This is an open market with lots of food shops. It is cheap, clean and serves nutritious south indian food. Try vadas (2 pieces for a dollar), with unlimited supply of sambhar and chutney. Plain dosa for a dollar and a few cents..There are fresh juice shops as well as some other south asian cuisines but Indian food dominates. This place is a must visit if you love this kind of food
