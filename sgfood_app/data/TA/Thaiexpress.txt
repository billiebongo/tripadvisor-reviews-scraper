I visited this restaurant with family. I found the ambience and the service excellent. The food served very delicately wrapped in typical banana leaves with fresh sea food. Just liked the place and would recommend other to try out here.

Nice Thai Food restaurant. Noting special about it. But good to try out. I like their Panda Leaf Chicken

Authentic tasting thai food, good service and lovely coconut ice cream. Also, another favourite would be the very spicy yet delicious kway teow noodle soup, do make sure you add lots of lime!

they will even reduce the spices for you completely if you request them for things like BAsil chicken. The thai curries are pretty decent too. both red and green. staff is normally quite helpful and hospitable at all outlets

This is a large chain with about 25 restaurants in Southeast Asia. Unfortunately
the food is uninspiring and does not taste Thai at all. There are better places
for Thai food in Singapore. We will not go there again.

Thai Express is a contemporary Thai chain of Restaurants offering food prepared with choicest ingredients in a relaxed ambience.The menu also boasts of a separate section for vegetarians much to their delight. Serving portions are good for one as well as for a group whichever category you call into. A must try !

We ate here one evening and the food is very good quality. We had spring rolls, pad thai and honey chicken. All served quickly, very tasty and well priced. Worth a visit if you are in Vivo City and want a value meal that is quality

Some of the food is spicy because it is Thai so most foods might be spicy like Tom Yam Soup if you don't like spicy foods then its a bummer to order something and then it turns out to be more spicy then you thought and then you wouldn't like i

Quite disgusted that when visiting this restuarant they refused to serve service water for our two children aged 2 and 4 years old. We were told that we would have to buy their bottled water 600 ml at $1.90. Now interestingly enough, Thai Express used to served service water so this isn't about the customers, it's more about the profit. Well, I'm not going to be blackmailed into buying ThaiExpress water so my quick thinking wife popped out to Watsons and we managed to buy 800 ml for $1.00. Really Thai Express Management, this leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be coming back to Thai Express again! Just as I finished typing this out ... One of the senior staff offered me a bottle of water and two glasses for the kids!!! BUT that was only after I asked for the full address of this Thai Express. The morale of this story is NOT to bring Children to Thai Express.

I liked the atmosphere and also the food which I ordered. But the food were a bit oily so if you want to avoid oily food then you need go anywhere else. Otherwise cost wise it was good. The prices of the food were reasonable ( no discounts were given )
