Charlie was a breath of fresh air in Boat Quay which is known for its seedy tourist traps!
We were 11 friends and 10 out of 11 liked what western dishes they ordered!
Not bad!
Prices are reasonable, too!

A good place to chill after work.. drinks and food was good. Nice view facing the Singapore river...
5
Good place to chill and hangout with friends and family. Food is good and decent too. A must try when you visit boat quay.

Spent a couple of hours here, watching formula 1. The burger was very tasty. Personnel was friendly as well.
3
Came here for lunch by chance as it has lunch promo. Ordered the fish n chips and the chicken. Both tasted pretty alright but not exceptional. Service was average as well.
5
A place which is comfortable with great food. Great place for conversations with your friends or business partners.

We ordered the lamb and it was overburnt - all 4 pieces! It was terrible and after removing the charred pieces, not much lamb was left to be eaten. It was a pathetic plate of lamb. The fish and ships were soaked in oil. Again, it tasted horrible because it's too oily. Lastly, the cod fish was. It even cod fish! It was some frozen, tasteless frozen piece of fish which was so dry. The food standard is pathetically horrible and we will never ever visit here again. As for the service, they were downright irresponsible. While we made an online reservation and turned up on time, they had unilaterally cancelled our reservation purely because they didn't want to pay the service fee to the online service partner! This was exactly what they told said. In fact they asked us to cancel the reservation after we placed our orders because the orders we placed were set meals and the online reservation through the service partner does not apply to set meals. It was not stated anywhere that we could not order set meals if we were to make this online reservation! They added that if we do not cancel, they would have to incur this service fee. This was the most absurd thing we have ever heard. True enough, they unilaterally cancelled our reservation 2 days after we visited the restaurant even though we turned up I.e. It was not a case of no-show from us. Most pathetic restaurant ever with horrible food and even poorer service and policy. Won't visit them again.

The nachos are yummy, the bowl of olives is huge, the chicken wings are tasty, the ribs are tender, the sauvignon blanc from NZ is lovely. I wasn't impressed with the service at first add the waitresses were constantly looking towards the main building /walkway and hardly looking towards the outside seating area so getting their attention was difficult (my arm got tired from holding it up). When Baljit noticed his service was excellent. He totally looked after my gluten free needs. We'll come back.

Probably just as good as any other place along the strip. No complaints about any of our lunches and set menu good value. Service was friendly and punctual. Try and eat after 1:00 because all the financial people are having their lunch break along boat quay

Went to this place with some people from work after we finished a long week.The ambience was ok because it was boat quay but they lack in food. I am by no means a chef or Spanish but have tried. a lot of Spanish food and this was just ok. Miss seasoning but will come back and tr other dishes
2
We only have a drink here. Coke light, but it tast like there is a lot of water in it and has almost no sparkling anymore.
The WiFi is ok√©, so I can write this review now.
3
Charlie's has a good happy hour, but the food is strictly average. Burgers are not the usual good quality found in Singapore, but a much softer, cheaper version. You can do better!
4
Avoid the steak - was told its tough. I ordered the fish and chips. Not too bad but the batter was quite thick.
5
Haven't been back for a while. The service at Charlie's is always fabulous. Easy relaxed and friendly staff makes our visit enjoyable always
4
The lamb with the Chope menu was quite special. It was well executed as the lamb (4 pieces with ribs) was tender and juicy. Fantastic!
4
Went there for a weekday lunch and it was relatively quiet. Food was great and portion big, service could have been better. My partner was served with a used cup (with lipstick stain) so that wasn't too pleasant.
5
The squid ink seafood paella had lots of seafood, tasted wonderful. So was the grilled chicken caesar salad. Service was excellent too
2
Food looks good, but once you tuck into them, you get over cooked lamb (2 types were ordered), undercooked hog (pork). Attentiveness to orders were not considered. We are of two couples, two mains arrived, with the other two arriving half an hour later.Only plus point was the friendly staff and location, which sits just at the river
3
We snagged a table right on the water's edge and managed to hit drink special time (at least for beer; only $27 for a jug of Tiger). The view is unforgettable. The food was unfortunately a bit forgettable. Not that it was bad but that it wasn't as good as the setting or the service. The octopus was reasonably well cooked but really no spice to it and the skewers were okay
3
The restaurant was not crowded but the waiter who showed us to our table just left us alone until we hv to look for service staff to get the menu n asked for water to b served while deciding what to order. They need to improve on this area.
5
The food is nice.... the staffs are friendly.. worth for money and I will sure to patron this restaurant again.
5
We were treated very well and had a good time. The manager Janine has read all our wishes from the eyes and is simply a funny and very friendly person.
2
Nice view an had seat next to river. I had lamb which was meant to be a rack but was actually 3 chops. Very fatty. Other diner had salmon which was passable. Expensive for ordinary food and experience.
1
We ordered the baby back ribs and beef fajita. The beef was incredibly tough and consequently very difficult to eat. The ribs were only marginally better. In addition, the beef did not taste good. The ribs tasted alright, but still too tough.
4
We just tried our luck here. The antipasti were good, the ribs were a treat. Fantastic! The seasoning of the ribs was sensational. We share the large rack and this was together with the antipasti a full meal. Smoking is allowed if you sit at the waterfront. The waitresses provided great services with a smil
3
Food was very average, we had a selection from the starters between a large group.Calamari really wasn't good, too much batter / bread crumbs!!Patas Bravas were goodGreat service and good music Overall we had a great night, but reviewing food hence the 3 star

I was a little skeptical if good food indeed exists in a pub.But I was wrong. Here's my rating:Free Wifi: Yes. StrongService: ExcellentFood: Way better than I expected.My sister & I ordered the chicken fajitas & their signature baby back ribs for dinner.Chicken Fajitas:The tender chicken came on a hot place. Sizzling & yummy.The 3 slices of tortilla came in a separate container.The guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo were all very generous.Signature Baby Back Ribs: Very well marinated, and better than the famous chain that started in Miami.The pricing appears steep but that's because the servings were huge.When we left, satisfied, we desperate needed to walk & digest all that aweome substantial dinner. We couldn't because we were going to Victoria Concert Hall. And we didn't sit by the river bec we need air-con in very humid Singapore !!

Not that I have anything against the food at Charlie's, no. On the contrary, we enjoyed our food the night we had dinner here. My husband had Angus steak and I opted for the Norwegian Salmon for our mains and we thought they were well-prepared and the portion, more than sufficient. We also had salad and mushroom soup and they were of decent quality as well. I mean, who gets these things wrong anyway?:) But what won us over was the view of the museum across the river and the general serenity of the riverside, especially after a heavy downpour. Yes, we were lucky enough to get the nice spot just next to the river and we all know how a good view amplifies dining experience. The staff were also very capable and quick on their feet. We were attended to very well and didn't have to wait so long for our food and drinks. Price-wise, I think it's okay. It's not ridiculously expensive like a few restaurants in Boat Quay tend to be. On a scale of 10, I'd give Charlie's Tapas an 8
5
The ambience of the place was good and by the Boat quay river. Very relaxing while enjoying the good view on TOP of the delicious food. We had the truffle fries, croquette, chorizo, nachos beef, black Angus beef and chicken burger. All was good especially the beef was prepared so well. Will visit again

Mid-week, you're really hungry and you dont want to head home before eating something. Charlie's has generous main course portions that makes every dollar worth. The quality of meat isnt quite Burnt Ends/Bedrock standard but for the value, it makes this place good. Excellent service staff and they served all 6 main courses at the SAME TIME! (a rarity in Singapore) Thumbs up
5
Good food and you have nice option of whether you want to dine indoor or outdoor. If you want some quiet time, make sure you book not on the big games night. Good food, very nice ambience and wonderful staff
4
Good location on Boat Quay. Visited for dinner on business, quiet as a Sunday night. Serves good choice of Tapas
2
We ordered a few tapas to start-one of the Portuguese sausages, the crostini with Serrano ham and feta and the tandoori chicken quesadilla. We then ordered rack of lamb and were thankful they were out of lamb because after eating our appetizers we wanted to eat somewhere else. The tandoori chicken quesadilla had so much potential but didn't really have a tandoori flavor. Not bad though. The sausages were very greasy, small portion, but good. The crostini with ham and feta--just look at the picture. I mean really?? It was like a stale crostini, a slice of meat and literally the smallest crumble of cheese I've ever seen. So sad. The good:Our service was good and attentive, perks for that. And happy hour drinks until 9 was great! Also lots of outdoor seating.

Came here for a quick lunch today. It was a bit warm outside and people were smoking so we chose to eat inside, opting for the lamb chops and the grilled fish. Food was quite ok for the price. Friendly and efficient service. Good value for money
5
We love coming to Charlie's for a very simple reason - the staff. They are always friendly and very accommodating, and coming back here always feels like we're back at a friend's place instead of a run of the mill restaurant/pub. The food and drinks are great too.. love the nachos and the calamari rings
1
A friend and I went for dinner. Had to flag down staff to order. Meals came out 20 minutes apart, meaning we had to eat individually or the first served had to wait and have cold food. Steak ordered well done was served medium rare. Very disappointing. Staff comped dessert when alerted to issues.

December 31st is global party and this year we decided to celebrate in Singapore. Bringing in the New Year watching the amazing fireworks with Marina Bay Sands Hotel as the background, 6 of us with two kids made our way towards Boat Quay to find a place to begin our own party. Walking down the street we saw most places were full with people enjoying the music, drinks and was a beautiful feeling. We zeroed in on Charlie's and quickly were given a table to accommodate 8 of us. We were served by an extremely friendly waitress named `Jane'. She was super quick and very attentive to our orders and also shared a bit of light conversation with us. The drinks were undiluted and cocktails definitely had the required punch. Unfortunately bites options were limited to chicken wings, nachos and a burger. The cook was in a hurry to close the kitchen and so we were left with no more light eats. Thought drinks were still on offer. All in all a good place to chill

Friendly service with a smile, cold beer and good food. Shady table next to the river on Boat Quay, Interesting to watch all the activity on the water with little boats and men with fishing nets scooping up any rubbish....Singapore is so tidy! There were trip boats and working craft and one of the best views in the world.What more do you need
4
This is a great place to come with friends and enjoying tapas wile having drinks. The card has a large choice of tapas and they are very good. This bar brews its own beer. I tried two and they are really good. I did not try the wines as we were with friends and we all decided to get beer with our tapas menu
4
Good selection of food, if you have had enough of noodles, try Charlies.Tapas,Burgers, stone grill, mexican, Italian spaghetti. Tiger Beer on draught $13singapore dollar a pint, similar to europe prices.food lots of and tasty. Best was the tapas and Fajitas, the chicken burger was a bit like sausage meat, not solid meat burger
5
This place was awesome to watch the Chinese GP. Lots of screens inside(aircon) and out and volume pumping so you can hear commentary. Also very close to Park Royal on Pickering and the other Stanley Quay Hotels

Enough but not wonderfull !
We order hot tapas we get it cold.
A little bit expensive local beer.
Salad small size.
Good and fast service.

The setting at Boat Quay was great, with nice service.
The experience maybe was made better as India won against Pak in the cricket match...The boat quay area lends its vibe to all such eateries and makes for a memorable experience.
1
The location and deco are nice, the service is friendly and the drinks ok. But the food is revolting, I can't believe a properly trained chef works in that kitchen.
4
If you want good Mexican food, fast food style, this is the place to go. It is on the ever-popular Orchard Road, you can walk there after shopping. The service is quick, the decor is faux Mexican...what else do you want?
5
the food is above average. the service was satisfying and the manager was so accommodating. we plan to go back again soon
4
been once to this place with my friends. Basically they serving good quality food, so do drinks, with great location at the CBD area of Singapore.
2
Actually, very average is probably too kind. Bland, unimaginative, more bar snacks than tapas.
Only pro's would be that it's not a bad location, particularly on the terrace, and the service was friendly and attentive
3
Went here for something to eat and a few drinks while we watch the Australian Open Final. Always looks busy so thought we would give it a try. Nothing to write home about . Food was average and much better available along Boat Quay and at better value. Nachos must be the worst we have ever had. Guacamole was in almost liquid form from a squeezey bottle! Mini chicken burgers -pretty tasteless and not that warm.
1
We went here hoping for a nice relaxing meal at the boat quay and we left very disappointed. The service was terrible, they took ages to take our order and then once we ordered they took part of our table away leaving us with very little space. We both had the fajitas, which until now, I didn't think you could go wrong with. The chicken was very fatty and full of gristle and the wraps were dry and stale. The service continued to be bad for the rest of the evening, we won't be returning.
