Good food. Better service. And open 24/7.
Though mainly themed Indian, they serve pretty much anything - and irrespective of the time they serve it hot and fresh.
A must try - two thumbs up !!!

I ordered a mutton thali, it was excellent, very tasty and a lot of food including naan and a banana. It only cost S$14 which was excellent value. We also ordered a medium murtabak that was enormous.However no alcohol is served and toilets are not very nice

We stayed a few nights in Little India and found ourselves eating here on a Sunday afternoon. The menu was large, dishes were very tasty indeed - drinks (lassi and ice tea) as well. Despite the small challenge of communication with the waiter, we finally had what we ordered and enjoyed it

In the heart of Little India is this unassuming yet well known local eatery. It is a kerbside caf√É¬© mainly catering to locals. It serves very good budget food. My Bhuna Ghos Mutton was to order cooked in 20 minutes and cost $10 with rice $1 and hot lemon tea $1 . A good dinner at a happy price.Highly recommended , if you are comfortable to eat kerbside.

I've found the best briyani (Ambur) on the planet.Presentation of was very nice and made feel more hungry... And the food taste was very good, and this includes the atmosphere as well , perfect place to unwind after work, celebrate on weekends...

Extensive menu selection. We choose the vegetarian Tali (southern India). Delicious. No haste or pressure. A great experience. Under S$20 including drink for 2.

its open 24 hrs, they have good selection of fruit juices and food is prepared as per their customers order, dined in for breakfast, we tried paratha, aloo ki bhujia, scrambled egg, chai & lemon juice which are very satisfying and easy on the pocket

We went here for breakfast as it was close to our hotel and had a lot of choice for food. We went here both days we were in Singapore for breakfast as it was very reasonable with good portions.

How come an indian restaurant like this can be slow?? Can't underestand., the bugs in the place weee faster than the waiters. Plus, the food is not a highlight.
5
My visit to Singapore was a totally awsome experience :) but the cherry on top was this small restaurant near my hotel !!!! The best part is that its open 24/7 Everyday i used to try something new and loved everything esp dum biryani & the south indian thaali . ....OMG ....both these dishes and lime soda are out of this world ‚ù§ Highly recommended to any1 who wants to try authentic indian food in Singapore.

Visited this place on recommendation from our hotel and so glad we did. Food was delicious, so much choice and the service was pretty quick. This isn't the type of place you spend a full evening but food wise it was excellent. Would return if looking for Indian food in Singapore again
