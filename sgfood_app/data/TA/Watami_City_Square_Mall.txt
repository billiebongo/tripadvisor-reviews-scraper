Lunch set is good value for money. Meat has a lot of fat. service is great. a good place for families and friends.

Ordered two dishes and a drink. Finished the first dish and had to remind the staff about the drink. Had to wait quite a while for the drink and the second dish.

Price on menu very impressive, one huge sets meal consist of many little items $19-23 something. But of cause you get what you pay. If not fussy is okay simple meal to fill the tummy. The hot pot meal is nice pipping hot cook yourself type.Service staff are young so got to give them discount

Made a reservation and was seated with no fuss - no wait too! Don't expect "blow-me-away" quality for the prices that you are paying, but pretty decent-tasting Japanese food that I wouldn't mind visiting again. What was good though, was the portion sizes as they were pretty generous. Overall, a pleasant enough dining experience which I would recommend for families

Reasonable price and wide variety. Today, we ordered the set for 2 at $53 (hotpot option). There is another rice/noodle option at $51.It consists of 1 salad, 2 sides, 1 appetiser, 1 udon or rice and 1 hotpot.We had:Watami salad - add $1Fried tofu with cheese mentaiko Chicken cutlet Salmon teriyaki - add $2Beef hotpotSprite and Yuzu SosaA lot of food and actually good for 3 people. Taste wise generally good but we were thirsty and we had to remind twice for our soft drinks. It came 30 mins later! Seriously?

Watami is always consistent with good pricing, variety and convenience. Don't bother if you are looking for food that would blow your mind but as a family restaurant, you get great value for money. Most staff are harressed looking and worn out, they really need to look into hiring more staff! The beef sukiyaki is great but skip the doughy soggy tempura. Their Grand menu is always good for a large group who are indecisive

One of the reason why I like to visit this place is their choice of variety, good food quality and decent price. Service was ok - but got room for improvement as the server didn't understand what we asked for despite acknowledging it. However, the manager assisted and coached the waiter, hopefully the waiter understands what the manager says too.
