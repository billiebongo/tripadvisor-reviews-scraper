Yes to the best unagi in Singapore. Even though we had to queue in the rain, it was all worth while. Rather small shop and hence the wait.
5
They only focus on fresh Unagi, cook & serve fresh that you can't find in other Japanese restaurant. Taste is excellent, but usually crowded with long queue. Not a cheap eat but worth of the price!
5
Fresh and delicious Unagi from Japan. Grilled perfectly, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. But we had to queue for 1/2 hour.
3
There was a queue on Wed 6pm but the queue was brisk. No shelter while queueing.Basic Japanese restaurant setting. Good service. The taste of the Unagi is fresh and tasty. It was well prepared with a smokey taste. However, the taste does not warrant the $30 price tag. The serving is very small. I left the restaurant feeling only half - full. I did not dare to ask my hubby and teenage son if it was satisfying for them. I feel that I do not mind paying $30 if the serving is hearty. Even the freshly grated wasabi did not help in making it a more satisfying meal. If Man Man does not serve a bigger serving soon, the novelty may not last long. I may miss the taste but I will not be returning again

Food was good but must be prepared to queue under rain or shine. The restaurant does not accept booking. Since there are only about 30 to 40 seats in the restaurant, queues can be rather long. During peak hours, expect to wait for an hour. Although service is fast once you get a seat, perhaps a better system can be worked out.
4
Giving the place 4 stars, despite the how good the food was, is mainly because of the slightly higher price at close to $30 per bowl which may be expensive to some.Nevertheless, the unagi was absolutely amazing and one of best that I've tried. The skin was grilled to a sweet, slight crisp while the meat inside stayed soft and juicy. Each bite of the fish made me look forward to more. The fish is also caught fresh from a small aquarium they have. Tried the Bubbles Bubbles cocktail as well at $13, which has just the right amount of sweetness and gas without going too strong on the alcohol.There are only mainly unagi dishes here though (the name should give you a clue), with some pork belly rice, but the food was definitely worth it. The ambiance of the place reminds me of Japan as well.If you have some cash to spare and looking for a good unagi place, I will definitely recommend it
5
Was there with my hubby for dinner, restaurant opens at 6pm, but there was already a queue forming 30mins before they opens. Customers are being seated in a orderly and efficient manner. The food is served quickly. Definitely will return for their unagi again because its just too good...
4
Food was good. Not a good place to chit chat as it’s really small, service was not too bad. Only complain is that there’s no sheltered waiting area. I had to wait in the rain once and under the hot sun on my second visit. Otherwise, good place for unagi cravings :
3
The wait to get in the restaurant was horrendous. Suppose on a saturday made it worse. Had to queue under the hot sun for more than 1 hour. The staff were friendly and helpful. Food was nice but not exceptional to warrant the inconvenience. The place was patronised by the younger crowd and its eat and go with no chance to linger on as you do not want the poor souls waiting outside for a seat. The price is not cheap either, for a bowl of rice with unagi expect to pay $30.00
4
Went later this time to skip the long wait. Got in within 10 minutes. The food was still very good. Eel was fluffy and fresh. Very tasty. We even bought a takeaway bento and ate it a few hours later, Still very good. Service inside was quite prompt. The host at the door though, looks like he didn't know what he was doing. Overall happy with this visit
4
Everything on the menu is unagi , except one pork item with rice . First time here , quite interesting , you get to watch them slaughter the eel, and grill it .
5
Crispy eel? You bet. Grilled perfectly where you get parts of it charred and crispy yet soft on the inside. If there are two of you, one take the salted eel and the other take the standard and then swop half to get the best of both worlds. The egg unagi side order however, you can give it a miss. not quite worth the $14. And be prepared for its famous queue. I queued 1.5hrs. :
4
Tried twice before, but the queues were ridiculous. Managed to go earlier today.This place has a lot of expexta to live up to. My eel with sauce was fluffy and we'll cooked. The accompanying liver on the other hand, was not. It was overcooked and tough.Overall not the equal of better eel places you can find in most department stores in Tokyo
4
5 stars for the quality of the unagi.The rest of the eatery needs some work. Soup was limp. Setting and ambience inconsistent with the premium pricing.Great unagi but needs work to justify the price in a eatery that is more cafe than unagi Restaurant
5
This restaurant serves eel that is brought in live then prepared at the restaurant. The unagi was grilled perfectly - tasty and juicy. You don't need to add the sauce - which I found salty. Just add pepper! Service in the restaurant was efficient. Would recommend.
5
Was recommended by a friend to this place. It's supposedly his favorite Unagi restaurant in Singapore. The lunch queue was about 40 mins but it was well worth it. Eels are freshly deboned and bbq over charcoal fire. It tastes very fresh and delicious. Would not recommend adding any more sauce (provided at the table) as I found them too salty.
5
This is the best unagi I have ever tried. Fresh eel, crispy outside while still juicy inside. Sweet sauce is also very tasty. You need to be there quite early to get in as first batch of visitor. This is since there is a long queue everyday. I have arriced there 30mins before restaurant open and manage to get a seat quite early.Will revisit definitely next time for jap eel
5
Fresh unagi - grilled to perfection.If you are going, consider going early, like 11:00 - 11:15 am to guarantee yourself the first seating. Everyone in your party must be present to get seated.The menu is relatively simple - unagi small, medium, large or XL (huge). Some other options like pork and umaki and other simple bites. Its simple because its really an unagi restaurant, like the sign says.Service is quick and excellent, no qualms about rating it tops. Some people do not like having had to wait so long for a seat, only to be served so quickly and realize their meal is over in 20 minutes! LOL.Anyway, highly recommend this place. Portions are good. Unagi is very fresh. You may also get to grate fresh wasabi
5
The unagi here is outstanding and fantastic. grilled over charcoal and marinated in what I've tasted to be a great recipe, it was something I have tasted in nowhere else. Tender, juicy, meat and tasteful of soy sauce. The best part of it all was the crunchy skin which was nicely charred, an element I had not seen in other unagi ju. And the other highlight was fresh wasabi root that was served to the table. While it required the patron to grate on the spot, the flavor and aroma well worth the effort. If I were to go for an eel, now I know where to go in Singapore. Be careful for the long queue

Was there on a Sat afternoon about 1405h. Queue outside the restaurant with shades.Got a table at 1440h. The staff at the entrance(a 20s male) was very rude. He told us that if he didn't tell us to leave, we will get a table. The closing time was 1430h.When it's our turn, he used 2 fingers (like a rabbit sign inverted) to tell us to come forward to the 2nd floor restaurant.That's totally unacceptable!!! No pleasantries and made us feel like he is doing us a favour!! A subsidiary of Teppei??? What a difference!! The restaurant come off more like a student joint with average of $30++ per person. The restaurant is messy , not like other Japanese restaurant. Overall...NO WAY!! Imagine is good, but no big deal!! With service like these...forget it.First and last time.!!

Other than rhe long lines of folks eager to lay their sticky selves upon the shop's unimpressive offerings, there's little else to be said for it.
They're opening a branch in Bugis. Go there instead.

Had a weekday lunch at Man Man Unagi. i came at around 1300, and there was no queue at all, was seated straight away. Heard the queues were crazy but i guess post-lunch time is a good time to go. I had the large portion Unagi set which cost $39.40. In my opinion its a bit pricey, but then again judging by how popular it is (heard the queues can be as long as an hour or something) i guess it isn't too ridiculous. The large portion was really filling. Unagi tastes good too, where you can choose from sweet/spicy/unagi sauce. The wasabi was nice too - you have to grate it yourself. the wasabi adds to the novelty factor, which i guess could be a reason why its so popular and hence the price (wasabi stalk isn't very cheap).overall, i won't say its fantastic, but would be nice to try and have fun grating the wasabi. they have many interesting unagi side dishes too. wouldn't queue an hour for it, but if there's no/short queue i wouldn' mind giving it a go!PS: for drivers, remember to put coupon. the summon uncle/auntie are very on-the-ball
5
Crazy long queues here, which in Singapore can only mean good and/or reasonably cheap food. We waited 45mins in all before we were given a counter seat at 730pm. Menu is pretty much all about unagi, so there is practically a conveyor-belt-like-system for the unagi, and our food came fast. Unagi was really good, but it was really pricey as well, our total bill cane up to about $100 for 2, for 2 unagi dons, and 2 sodas. When we left the queues were still just as long. Good to try if you are around the area
5
Finally I tried Man Man Japanese Unagi after hearing so much about it. I tried it at the 2nd branch: Duo Bugis.We went around 9pm plus and it was quite crowded but not very long queue. We ordered the Unagi set and porky set. Both are yummy. Eat plain by itself or with the broil taste super nice too. The Unagi is BBQed and coated with some Japanese sauce. Interesting is we get to grind some fresh wasabi to go with it. How many times will you get to try fresh wasabi? Not very spicy. The place is quite small restaurant hence not advisable for big group
5
Been here few times and the eel is incredibly good. On recent visit for lunch there was a faint but obvious smell of stale seafood which was very likely from the eel tank. The tank may have been a good selling point before to show that the eels are live and fresh. Man Man has proven time and again that their food is excellent. Suggest the tank be replaced by more seating and mainly to prevent the smell from getting more prominent
4
I went to Man Man for a weekday lunch. The waiting time was not too bad. It took the six of us 40 minutes to get a table. The food was very yummy. It was the best unagi rice I've ever had. The grilled unagi was crispy outside and tender inside. The show (killing and cooking the fish in front of the customers) was interesting but not very necessary in my opinion. Maybe it gave customers the assurance that the food was fresh.The food was a little pricey. Given the quality, I think it was well worth it
3
Friend brought us there queue for 40 mins 2nd in the queue. Had unagi and rice $30 per person not really worth the price, only heard about it just give it a tried. Will not return many nicer foods fir that kind of price and no so long queue.You queue because the place is small about 18-20 table fir two type so therefore is always crowded.Social media also attrack alot of youngest and tourist
3
Good that they are opening another branch. Good quality food but I am not sure how many will find it worthwhile after queuing in the hot sun for more than an hour for the meal. I didnâ€™t. Would love to go back when they have better queue management system as the current one is obviously not working well. With slightly over 40 seats in one seating, we counted that we were in the range of 30 in the Q but then many were queuing for more people who only joined their friends in q when the restaurant was about to open. If we have known earlier that we would not be able to get on the first seating, we will not have started joining the Q.
3
The restaurant makes a good bowl of unagi rice. While it is good, thanks to social media influencers' exaggeration, easily mind-controlled mortals see this as a hidden gem. Yes the place is sort of hidden, yes the food is good. Is it over the top and the best in Singapore, such that it is worth queuing for over an hour? The answer is no as these people probably have not eaten at Mikuni.I hope reviewers learn to be objective, instead of tasting with other senses. Some people taste based on what they hear, some people taste by reviews that they read, some people taste by the ambience of the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, as I've acknowledged that the food is nice. Just not worth the queue over something you can get at other restaurants, without the wait
4
We had to queue for almost an hour during weekday lunch but it was worth the wait .The lovely freshly cooked unagi was crisp outside and soft inside . We can see the chefs at work through the glass . Tea was complimentary and we can grate our own fresh wasabi
5
Be prepared for long queue on weekends.
Can queue up to 2hrs.
Shop closes at 10pm.
Food is superb.
Fresh unagi, sliced, prepared and cooked on the spot.
5
We visited this restaurant at the recommendation of some friends. The quality of the eel was so good, probably due to the fact that they were really fresh (there are live eels in the tank at the entrance). The fish was grilled to a nice crispy exterior and a fleshy, succulent interior. Sauces were really good, and I enjoyed the experience of grating my own wasabi into the rice. The 45 minute wait was well worth it. And the price of $30? Rather value for money
4
There were about 40 people in the queue when we arrived at 7pm. It was also a long wait on two other occasions, one of which was for lunch.So were the eels the real deal?I would say yes, these elongated fish were thoroughly marinated and perfectly grilled, smoking out any fishiness. The meat is flavourful and crispy on the outside, naturally sweet and tender on the inside. Oishinei !To top that, you could season them with an assortment of sauces and condiments. Some sets came with a stub of fresh wasabi root and grater, and you could further authenticate your experience, grating a stub of fresh wasabi root...Only eel and eel sets were on the menu. The price ranged from a medium set about $28 to large set about $36. Man Man was a tiny joint, the tables cramped closely, not unlike the those eateries tucked in narrow lanes in Japanese cities.Inside, the eels tanks were placed in front. I suppose guests were obliged to say something complimentary about them as they made their way to the table. The crew in the smoky kitchen filleted and grilled the eels behind a large glass window in full view of diners.We had our fill, and despite the very crowded condition in the small space, we enjoyed our meal of eels
5
There were 4 of us, and we took turn to queue. Reached exactly at 11.30am on a Sat, queued for 1.5 hrs before our turn. The queue is totally worth it. They have a tank of fresh eels and they were grilled right on the spot. It was very delicious and a little crunchy texture unlike the normal unagi which is soggy to taste. Although the queuing time can get long, the food waiting time is pretty quick. About 10-15 mins. A little pricey for the portion that was offered. But still we all love the food and definitely will go back again
4
The place to visit for fresh unagi. But be prepared to queue. Portion is not very big though especially for big boys. The medium and large set that come with 3 ways to eat is nothing unusual except the one that eat with dashi soup is nice. Can try for 1st timer but my next visit i will just probably go for the normal set and order extra unagi at the side instead.
5
delicious choices of unagi menu here. What makes it tasted so good is that the unagi is freshly prepared in front of us with an open kitchen that display the process of unagi being prepared and grilled, the result is a soft warm fresh unagi meat that melts in your mouth.The queue is quite long though, dont forget to bring umbrella to counter singapore's hot and humid weather. we arrived at 11.40am and had to wait around 1hour and 20min but it was all worth i
4
The grilled unagi is definitely fresh and yummy. Worth queuing for. During lunch time, the queue is likely to be at least 40 to 60 minutes long. The restaurant is smallish and has a seating capacity of less than 40pax. That is probably the reason for the queue aside from the delicious yummy unagi dish
5
My friend and I tried Man Man as we heard mixed reviews from other friends who have tried it. However, we wanted to try it for ourselves and see what lies in store for us. Despite being told that we needed to queue well before opening hours, we decided to be there at 1100 (lunch opening starts at 1130). They do not accept reservations, hence, the queue. We found that it was not so bad as we were about 15th in line. Once the door opened, it was a smooth process right to getting seated at our table. The food was excellent! We had the large hitsumabushi Unagi set and boy were we pleasantly surprised! The Unagi was perfectly char-grilled served on a bed of rice. We were told that we had to divide the our meal into 4 to enjoy it 4 ways:1. On it's own - eel and rice2. Eel, rice, spring onions 3. Eel, rice, spring onions and seaweed4. Eel, rice, spring onions, seaweed and pouring a pot of soup so that it becomes some sort of Unagi porridge We enjoyed all combinations tremendously and an addition of wasabi (real horseradish that you have to grate yourself - they provided with a cute mini grater) really lifts the whole dish up. Was it worth the queue?! Definitely! #muchlove
5
- fresh unagi (killed and processed in the restaurant)- very different texture and taste with the common unagi that served in general Japanese restaurant - one of the must try food in Singapore- prepare to beat the long queue with umbrella in case of rainy or sunny day as you will queue at an open are

I have travelled the world and have eaten at many of the Japanese restaurants and always feel a warm welcome and given excellence service. The place is very conducive and relaxing even how busy and small they are. Very authentic and cultured. That's my impression of such Japanese restaurants.I wonder if Man Man is owned and run by a Japanese?Besides the long boring and minimum one hour queue I have always been told what to do whenever I am in the restaurant.I never get the feeling that I am a customer and needs to be served. Rather have to be ordered even as to where I can stand and sit.The restaurant is too cramp and too small for comfort. But many Japanese restaurants that I frequent are very small too especially the ones in Tokyo but I always feel welcomed and they provided excellent service with good food and they never ignore their customers and always attending to their needs. At Man Man I mentioned to the person in charge that I have a back problem and need to sit down as I was standing in the queue for nearly an hour. She just shove the chair over to me and she rudely say "I am the MANAGER here"I wonder if there is no customer will they have a manager around. The point is who's first? Customer or business.I ordered the unagi and fish egg. The fish egg is over burned and very bitter.If you wish to eat good and authentic unagi Japanese style please go to Nagoya. Ask trip advisor for it. I am very sure they will do a good job.I'll never eat at this restaurant ever again let alone recommending to my friends.It's atrocious and loudly place to be
3
If you look at the cheaper price they are charging, it is good.
If you don't look at price, average to below average.
5
Fresh Unagi grilled to perfection. Delicious. Long queue is expected. Entrance located in the back alley. Took me a while to look for the place.
4
Japanese live eels !!! Cooked in front of you!! Just like in the shops in Japan. Like in narita village. Charcoal grill adds to the authenticity. Finally!!!!Food comes real fast!! Eel is done well and not too overly soaked in sauce.( thank goodness!!) Rice quality and doneness not quite up to standard. Awesome grilled eel livers not to be missed !!!!Having eaten countless times in Japan, I'd say very reasonably priced for live imported eel. It is really labour intensive. Hence the crowds..Service is a little lacking in 'enthusiasm' especially the Japanese staff but still a notch above the standard local restaurant. Overall a charming experience. Will be back if i don't visit Japan soon.

Man Man is a place that specializes in unagi (eel) cuisines. It's tucked away in Tanjong Pager, but if you happen to see a long queue chances are that you've found the place.My wife and I came here to experience the hype and their cooking. We arrived around 6:45pm and the wait was one hour before we had a table.I had the May special set that included the squids from Japan; it's in season as I was told and was a popular choice among other diners. The unagi was nicely grilled with a crispy outside and juicy tender meat from the inside; it's very tasty. I also liked the fresh wasabi that you could grind by yourself. The freshness and sweetness of it was distinctive.The customer turnover of the place was high, it's not the place for long meals and the atmosphere but to taste the hero of the place - unagi.Overall a nice experience
5
Best unagi don in Singapore, worth the long queue in the sun, fresh eel flown in from Japan, charcoal grilled right in front of you...crispy skin, melts in your mouth flesh, all you can add extra unagi sauce...yummyI would have deducted half a star for not taking reservations or they could have priced it higher to cut the daily long queue
5
Went there on a Monday morning and didn't have to queue at all! Go on a weekday if u want to avoid long queues as they don't accept reservations. Had the unagi set (forgot the name, but it's the one that can be eaten 4 ways) and it was so good. Unagi was done perfectly, sauce was sweet, and everything just went so well together. I personally prefer eating just the unagi and rice on its own. Only downside was my boyfriend and I sat near the eel tanks - quite a bad fishy smell when u first enter but you get used to it after a while. For the fresh unagi dons, i wouldn't mind a little stench! Will defo be back again!
5
The one of 2 places that serves fresh unagi.The unagi is charcoal grilled with slightly burnt skin but soft on the inside.The wasabi is fresh from the plant, you have to grate it yourself.The 3 ways of eating enhance the taste buds with different taste.However, the queue is at least an hour. I went at 6pm (opening time), 4th in the queue but queued for at least 45 mins as I have 5 people. It is the easiest to get seats for 2. Tried going at 8 plus 9, gets seats easily.Definitely worth it for the queue and price
4
Love the crispy skin and the fun of grating your own wasabi. If you wish to take the wasabi home, it costs $3 each. And a rather disturbing fact, they wash and re-serve the wasabi to the next customer. So please be nice to the wasabi. :)Menu looks like there's many items but essentially they are all unagi. There is also pork belly (as a side dish) that is not on the menu. Not sure what other off-the-menu items you can order. Because of the long queue, and quick turnaround needed, don't expect to sit around. They clear your trays the minute you finish, and are quick to show you the door. Would recommend going in small groups as the restaurant is really small
5
So far the best unagi in Singapore but you must be willing to queue, best to come around 9pm on a weekday. I walked past many times giving up as I see the amount of people waiting. It's fresh and nicely charred, but I am not sure I would queue for more than an hour so best to come late
5
Went to the restaurant on friend's recommendation. The place does not accept reservation. So to be there early if you want to avoid the long queue. Then again, if you dine alone or in pairs, you will get your table faster. You will get to see how the unagi are prepared for your meal, that is, if you can stomach the sight. There are few ways of eating the unagi don, with broth, spices, pickles or with the freshly shredded horseradish. Regardless your choice, the entire meal is very yummy. The unagi literally melts in your mouth. Since there is nothing much to eat at the place and the restaurant is pretty small, you will feel inconspicuous staying there for long.
5
Found this cause I noticed the huge que but it was gone an hour later so I strolled in No wait Amazing experience all young Japanese diners All unagi all the time rice yummy and super inexpensive in a town that loves to overpay Go before it's replaced by a shopping mall or condo towe
4
Visit Man Man first time.As every one mentioned queue is too long.They should consider sms service then we can wait at cafe or somewhere.Price is around 30-40.Japanese eel is now very expensive. So I think this price is OK.This eel is very crispy for us like this taste but not healthy.Totally I like this restaurant maybe visit once a month.Must item umbrella, Insect repellent, full charged mobile or book
4
Extremely popular restaurant so got to be early to avoid disappointment. Was the first in the queue before the shop opened at 5pm. We sat at the counter seats, right in front of the chefs grilling the unagi over the hot stove and dipping it in the sweet sauce. Great experience and yummy food! Watch out for the fine fish bones though
4
Place is a bit hard to find for first-timer, if you take public transport, stop at MRT Outram Park and walk your way from exit H.. The queue is quite long, but if you went there alone or 2 person, your chance of getting seat will be faster as the seats are quite limited.. Food wise, if you like unagi, u love this restaurant as they grilled them freshly on over counter charcoal grille
5
Really enjoyed their speciality hitsumabushi. Among the 3 eating methods, I personally prefer to eat with the freshly grated wasabi and lastly add the broth in when the rice is 1/4 left. Fyi-Be there early as the queue will start to form even before they are open
4
Hitsumabushi ($26.80+) is probably what every blogger is writing about. So I ordered it, & it was delicious. For a Unagi n00b like me (I don't eat it much because I don't fancy the texture), I like the idea of trying Unagi 3 different ways.I only wish the waitresses would explain how to eat them in these 3 ways, rather than just serving it to me & call it good. Having said that, however, service is quite attentive & they are smiley & polite I arrived at 5:57PM to a queue of about 10 individuals. Doors promptly opened at 6PM & those groups with all parties present were seated. Many chose to sit at the tables, but I wanted to sit where the action is: In front of the glass window. I sat at the corner seat where the eels were grilled in front of me!Taste-wise, it's yummy, & it wasn't overcooked. Now that I know Man Man serves delicious Unagi, I think I'll order Unagi with rice the next time because that's my favourite way of eating it. (Yes, that does mean I will be back.
3
Queue is too long, under the sun/rain. The eel is overly burned, so charcoaled. The waitresss are not friendly and are overly ego over the long queue, thus didnt bother to provide good service.Also, the eels may not be fresh. I saw a few dead eels in the water tank.But... I like the crispy skin and moist meat.If all is well, i will give a 5 star. But the overall experience e.g. queue under the sun/rain and ego waitresses, i give a 2
4
The restaurant was the latest by Chef Teppei. Interestingly the entrance to the place was at the back. Reached the place about 20 minutes before it opened and there was a queue of about 15 persons in front of me. The 6 counter seats were the first to fill up. The place was quite smoky. One could even smell the smoky grilling smell before entering the place. The place was decorated in a light wooden look. By the way I did see a customer who bought a couple of fresh eels back too. Tables were placed quite near to each other. There was barely place for bags but lucky I selected a table by the shelf, therefore got place in the shelf for bag.On the table, there was condiments such as sweet sauce, unagi sauce, spicy, Japanese pepper and chilli powder to help yourself to. Refillable Iced tea was served.Kimoyaki (Liver) ($9.80+)Looked quite charred, It was chewy with smoky although it was a tab bitter at certain parts.Yahatamaki ($14.80+)Unagi roll stuffed with pickled radish in it. Crunchy and tangy.Large Kouhaku Histsumabushi ($39.90+)Unagi Served with Mentaiko Sauce, Soup, Pickles, Broth, Spices.The dish was a January special.To eat Histsumabushi, divide the serving into 4 parts.1) Have one serving in the small bowl which is also known as torizara, to enjoy the dish in its original tasteyakumi2) Second serving, add the yakumi (condiments such as fresh wasabi, chopped spring onions and green onions). I spend quite a lot of time busy grating the wasabi. The fresh wasabi really peaked up the dish.3) Third serving, add the lightly-flavored dashi (made from simmering fish or meat) broth. The dish reminded one of teochew porridge.4) Eat the Last Serving the way You Like best. As for me, I like it with the broth and freshly grated wasabi in it.The layer of Mentaiko Sauce was a tab too little to make a different to the dish.Although there was long queue, most customers finished their meals quite fast

I would have given an excellent if not for the hour wait in the sweltering heat. We went before the restaurant opened but did not manage to get in the first round of entry. When we finally got it, I was so happy to see two glasses of cold tea set on the table without having to ask! All the Unagi dishes and sides we ordered tasted great. Esp the Eel liver. The only thing I did not like so much is the tamago side dish on my unagi set meal. It was a bit bland. We were seated in front of the kintchen gallery window where I could observe them slicing, cleaning and skewering the eel and watching them shrink over hot charcoal. It was very interesting. I preferred the white grilled eel that is not slathered with sauce. And I enjoyed chazuke very much. The other don was good but the sauce was a bit too sweet, personally. However, eel was cooked to perfection. I will return but might wait till the hype dies down. Lastly, I enjoyed grating fresh wasabi. It was fresh and tasty and not as spicy! However, it can become quite a chore after. Still, a wonderful meal

Went to this restaurant for lunch with 2 of my colleagues for lunch. Queued up by 11:10 am for the opening time of 11:30 am. We were first in queue so were seated first. The Unagi was quite yummy and the species was different from the one I had tasted in Tomoei (4-time 1-Michelin Star Unagi restaurant in Hakone, Japan) during my Mar trip. Tomoei's style was the Unagi was less burnt and the sauce was less sweeter. Man Man's style was more charred and sweeter. Would have given more stars if not for the fact that the waitress took the wrong order and we ended paying more than S$10 for each order which amounts to almost S$40 per pax for food that was wasted because the portion was too big for each of us. As no reservation is allowed, the wait for the restaurant to open was 30 mins followed by another 30 mins for the food. Don't think I would go back again as I have had one of the best blue eel in Japan
