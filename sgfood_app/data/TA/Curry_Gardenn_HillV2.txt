Food was non-oily, fresh spices used, reasonable price and Arun and Team served us very well. Very good thick curry gravy fish head dish that was super delicious and we particular liked the spices used in their food

They have a good spread of North & South Indian food. Do call earlier & request for the pepper grilled chicken (which is not on their menu). It is Excellent. Their Mangalore Mutton is tender, succulent & a hearty dish. Their prawn Sukka is one of the best prawn dish I have ever eaten in any Indian restaurants. Their naans are good. They offer the best Kashmiri naan in Singapore. They also offer a wide variety of tasty vegetarian options. My favourite is their ladies finger tawa. They have a good collection of wine to accompany their food

We went there for dinner. It was not much crowded, we ordered 3 curries and naan for us, to which waiter told us it may take 20-25 minutes. Since we were out for casual dinner and chit chat, we did not mind waiting for said time. However the actual wait was way longer, later we realized other guests had been waiting for very long for their food to arrive. What I noticed was the food was being prepared and packed for delivery guys from foodpanda, deliveroo etc. and it was quite fast. However the wait was only for guests dining in. However later our food arrived, by that time our hunger was bit diminished after eating papadam and beer to kill the wait. The food was okay, would hv rated better if it would have came when we were hungry. Also when Bill was presented, they mentioned service fee is not printed and they will charge the same 10% out of receipt plus original receipt cannot be provided. If i want the receipt I can take photo of amount without that extra charge added. Not professional but anyways ignored this. If I had to have their food next time I will better order online to deliver at home. The price is average and quantity of each dish is good to be shared.

Visited this on a hunch and overall a satisfied outing. In a relatively non rush area of Hillview into a small mall called HillV2. Very unassuming and not setting expectations very high, the restaurant services very decent north indian food and a very decent selection. has a good selection of alcohol too. The servings are small but sufficient. good for 2-3 persons. For a family of 4 we order 2 vegetable and they are just abt sufficient. One downside is that they do not serve complementary pappadam and mint chutney which you have come to expect in almost all indian restaurants. Food tastes fine. The tandoori roti was good becuase it was made of wheat rather than maida. Naans were decent too. Overall this can become a regular fixture if you want to add to a monthly outing of decent family dinner at reasonable costs in singapore. Service was quick but can be because of low rush

Waited 30 minutes for a masala dosa which was average, to say the least. Service being added automatically meant I actually left less of a tip than I had planned. It does wind me up when restaurants tell me what to tip (especially when you have to wait half and hour for a basic dish). Not impressed. So many other wonderful places to eat in this town.

I really enjoy the dishes that they have! I have the butter chicken which had a very nice smell of bbqe , the naans were wonderful and the rice was fluffy and nice.Had also the gobi Manchuria, the spinach, aloo gobi and mutton. The mutton literally melts in your mout

Positives:1.Food was tasty- we ordered roti,mutton kebab, mushroom tikka,paneer. Mutton was simply awesome.2. Price was pretty reasonable.3. Ambience is fine and the service was great.Negatives:1. The mango lassi seemed quite stale by the smell and sour taste.2. A way too much food color was added that even our fingers were stained

The service was very nice. I wanted to seat by the windows. But it was very cold. So bring a jacket if you're going to seat there. I hadn't had lots of Indian food before but this place will surprise you if you're a first timer. Be sure to try out their specials from time to time! Will be back again

Went on a Saturday. The restaurant was not crowded but they had a lot of online orders. So our orders came a little later. There was a good variety of food to choose from. Ordered a saag chicken, mangalore mutton, vegetables and chapatti. Would recommend. Food was a little cold but the taste was good.

Tried out this Indian restaurant as we have not tried it out before. The service I must say is very good and the food was acceptable and reasonable for the price they are charging.The interesting part is that this Indian restaurant also offered its version of Chinese style soup. However, we stayed clear and opted to try its Dahl soup which turned up quite nice.Then we also had Heavenly chicken, Aloo Gobi with Chicken paneer + 2 pcs of Garlic and Onion Naan. The serving portion is quite big so you may want to cut down the number of orders. We enjoyed the very fresh Mango Lassi and to finish the meal with Teh Tarik kurang manis (less sugar). We were quite pleased too with the complimentary papadam too
