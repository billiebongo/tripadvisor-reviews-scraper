Had late dinner after shopping at Mustafa. The food was delicious but not spicy enough. We ordered butterchicken and chicken kurma. Fresh juices were good quality as well

It's an awesome treat at Singapore if you are in search of Halal food and anywhere near Mustafa or little India. Don't miss their chicken tikka masala and chicken qaurma .
Fantastic desi food

The food quality is good chicken biriyani , mixed fried rice , cheese paratha , manchurian fish or chicken
Orange juice etc placed is clean and staff are attentive , good location
Halal compare to most neighbor restaurants

Went into this restaurant because it looked nice. The food was average - great Tandoori Chicken but the rest was just OK. The Cheese Naan was chewy and rubbery. The staff all had sour faces and stared at you which I found quite unnerving

Been here with family and friend Total 8 ppl with kidsNice food with nice staff.Although we ordered chicken Manchurian and it was very tasty so when we ordered it the second time it was pathetic. When we informed them about it they just smiled about it and looked puzzled and waiter was giving a look of "what can i do in this, i dont cook"

We went there just to check out but when we tried their masala chai we ended up visiting again for dinner. Very relaxing and tasty food. Hotel staff was so good that they even played rhymes on their computer for our daughter so we can enjoy our dinner peacefully Biryani was very tasty and over all was above out expectations. Definitely we will visit this place in our next visit

The food was good, took a long time coming. The BBQ chicken came in before the Parathas and the French Fries came in late, the fish fingers strangely later - so a lot of distortion and there were only 3 other patrons that I could see on the floor so really surprised with the delays faced!The food was good - the chicken is recommended, the fish fingers were good and their Parathas are very decent! The lime juice was perfectly balanced too
