serve one of the best bagel in Singapore
(i miss good NY bagels)
located along orchard road, this Deli deserves more publicity for its food.
one of the few places that offer pastrami sandwiches.
Bit pricey for Singapore standard..
3
Five of us at dinner at this restaurant. This is more of a high class pricey deli. The service very average. A beef hamburger is about $20. Selection of food fairly limited. Maybe this what you expected from deli cafe.
2
I ordered a scrambled egg smoked salmon and i received this...I was not sure if this was cooked or smoked....
4
Through the eatigo app, my friends and I reserved this place and had a great brunch! The pancakes were thick and fluffy and the bagels were fragrant! A beautiful place to chill
4
Had lunch at this New York style bagel restaurant. Like the bagel sandwich with smoke salmon. The beef burger looks great too!

This is my second time in Sacha & Sons however, this is my first time to really try their offerings. My first visit with them was for desserts & coffee. This particular visit, I had their Matzah Ball Soup. Followed by the Reuben Sandwich then their New York Cheesecake and a glass of Cabernet.This is the first time I had Matzah Ball Soup so I don’t really know what to expect & I am not familiar with the flavours. Theirs is a nice clear broth soup with flavour of Chicken. I appreciate how comforting this dish is, like the simpleness of the soup and the amazing taste of Matzah balls. At times, I thought I was eating Vienna sausage but when I googled Matzah Balls, I was surprised to know that it was actually a bread with chicken fat.The Reuben Sandwich that I had was in Brioche bread. I love Brioche so much and theirs tick all the boxes for me. The portion of Pastrami in the sandwich is very very generous and the taste is fabulous. I love how the amount of Sauerkraut is just perfect that the spotlight are all in the Pastrami.The New York Cheesecake is a revelation. The consistency of the cake is smooth, creamy and yet it isn’t light & mousse-y like. The Graham crackers base is beautiful and doesn’t crumble unlike most of the cheesecakes around in Singapore.The prices of wines by the glass are very competitive. A glass of house white is $7.90 and $9.90 for a red & rosé wine

Came for brunch. Food was good, but a little on the pricey side, considering how slow service was. Not sure why they would struggle to cover the place with 3 to 5 waiters available at any point considering it is really small and there aren't many tables. Add on to the fact that food took 30 to 45 minutes to come, and tea requiring 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared, so my recommendation if you were to want to try this place; come an hour before you want to have your meal. Is it worth the wait? Debatable

I was really happy when Sacha's first opened because it filled a void in the Singapore food scene by providing a Jewish deli. It took them a little time to refine but, on the whole, their food is really good, especially the pastrami. I get the sense that this hasn't been enough to sustain the business on its own because the current menu is much wider and more like a regular deli. The service is pretty average, but that's par for the course in Singapore. My real gripe would be with the pricing, which I think is too high for what you get. The best way to eat there is to book through Eatigo to get a discount, which brings the cost of the meal down into a range that makes it good value
2
You have to be prepared for the different service attitude in Singapore, but this place was awful. Take your order, then come back to say they're out of it, then come back to say they don't have your second choice. All SLOWLY.Then no hollendaise on the hash that clearly said it was supposed to be there.Very expensive
2
Late lunch, no big crowd, coffee machine broken , ran out of Gravlax, difficult to get the attention of the waiters, had to stand up twice and go to counter to ask for water refill asked for a change of cutlery for dessert and waitress had no idea where to put them in the table (!) waited for 15 minutes for the bill finally had to go to counter to pay as all staff chatting at the entrance. Maitre d lady at entrance was busy with her drink and paid zero attention to anything that was happening in the restaurant. Sadly the staff represents the establishment. Perhaps owners should hang around to check on service as it would be a pity if it closed due poor service
4
The sandwiches are always memorably enjoyable albeit pricey, in the sense that one has to pay for quality. Service during our lunch was efficient and friendly, too.
4
Bagel chips and dips are great. Pasta and mains are tasty and affordable. Little Black Dress rosé was good!
3
Did not manage to try their bestsellers as apparently those dishes sell out pretty quickly during brunch. Tried their corne beef hash and Coney dog which were average. Service is excellent though!:)
5
Went there for dinner and had a bagel. Food was really good. Service and atmosphere are quite nice as well.
5
Very good food and excellent service! The food was a little too salty for my liking, but overall a good experience
5
Had an eatigo discount, place looked nice so decided to book dinner there. Staff were courteous and friendly despite being swarmed with the weekend crowd. For food, decided to go with the XL Reuben with pastrimi on rye (size starts from 100g of meat with 50g increments each size) and a jalapeño cream cheese sesame bagel. The latkes were sold out, so guessing they're pretty good. I'm not much of a foodie, but damn it was delicious. My only advice would be to give more pickles for the larger sizes (since people might be sharing) and more sauce in the coleslaw. Tried getting the apple crumble for dessert but was sold out too. Went with the banana crepe which was alright, but nothing I'd write home for. I guess a great test to decide if a restaurant is good would be if I would go back if there wasn't a discount. The answer is definitely, and I hope there's a latke and an apple crumble slice waiting for me.
3
We couldn’t decide what to eat and was persuaded by the host who was standing outside the deli to give it a try. She recommended her favourite $22 “hash corned beef, pastrami, but substitute the fried egg with scrambled egg”. So we ordered that and there was a top up of $2 for the scrambled egg which we didn’t know until we asked for the bill. Generally ok dish save for the pastrami which was really tough. We ordered the fish and chips which is under a special menu and that was surprisingly simple and good. I will probably go back to try the Latkes but not in the near future. Btw, air conditioning was underwhelming there
3
I didn't like it when the lady at the front made my wife and I wait outside for a good 10 minutes before letting us in. The restaurant was not crowded. The wait staff were polite, friendly and patient. We ordered 3 dishes and each dish came almost 15 minutes apart which is not good because we couldn't eat together and had to watch each other eat. Lastly, the chicken sausage was a super let down, quality was real bad. Ambience was good though
1
Arrived at 9.40 pm for dinner at this nice pastrami shop. Out of surprise they said denied entry and said that last order is at 8.30 pm. What ? It’s only 10 min after 8.30 pm, they only need to cut the pastrami and serve it to us. Feels that I was talking to a robot or vending machine. I’m a frequent visitor, I know that it only takes a few minutes to cut the pastrami and serve to us. By the way your website says it close at 10.00 pm. I hope the owner of Sacha and sons can see read my review

We went here to have brunch on Saturday late morning. They serve mainly bagel, which unfortunately not soft enough to my liking. But they make great scramble eggs, especially the one with chicken sausage. Pricing is considered high and drinks choice are rather limited. Services are quite good and efficient, with a nice ambience as well.
5
Definitely a place I would frequent. Great cold meats, and good quality breads. Great selection on the menu too.
4
Ambience and food were both pleasant and comparable to the delicatessens I've tried in New York City. Will come back.
4
I have gone there twice and twice I was told the latkes were sold out. Both times I went for a late lunch so I suppose they must be really good. Maybe they could consider producing latkes in bigger batches so more people may try them. The Reuben sandwiches with beef pastrami are a must-try. The bagel with strawberry cream cheese spread is really good too. Only downside is that prices are a bit steep for deli food, which are really cheap in NYC. And also maybe consider bringing back juices and sodas on the menu on the wall. Was a bit disappointed when the server said they no longer served those.
1
The waiter was confused and didn’t know the options on the menu. He was coming back to us 4 times just to confirm the same order. It took 15 min just to understand the order . Unprofessional and very slow service. Didn’t get to taste the food, as we just left frustrated!
5
Amazing! Who would think you could find authentic, delicious and reasonably priced Ashkenazi food in Singapore. Try it, you will love it! I especially liked the Matzo Ball Soup.Very friendly service. Drinks list is limited (no fresh juices) but that is a small minus considering how good the food is
5
We came here upon reading great reviews on their pastrami, and we left totally satisfied. Their pastrami was flavourful and with lovely texture. Even one of our companions who usually does not fancy beef & cured meat complimented it!The brioche & bagel were also nice, as you would expect from its association with Wild Honey. Highly recommended
5
Saturday was crowded, but we got our seats quite reasonably quick considering it was packed. The manager was great and checked in with us a few times. People were enjoying their food and while there was a bit of a wait as there were just so many people (a long queue outside!), it was worth the wait. The bagel was simply delicious! The mains was marvelous and the steak was better than Lawry's. The service was fantastic and we could see that other people were enjoying themselves in the restaurant. Must try
1
Where do I start... from the absolutely inept service who places a family with 3 adults and 2 small kids on side by side on the high table of the bar to refusing to serve a boiled egg to my 3 year old, because it's not on the menu.... even though half of their dishes are based on egg since it's a brunch place. Their menu is weird. They have for example scrambled eggs with smoked salmon on the side, or fried eggs with pastrami on the side. But if you ask for fried eggs with salmon or scrambled eggs with pastrami they will tell you its not possible. Totally inflexible. The food tastes nice, but who cares when you're likely to pop an aneurism by the time you get it. The first time the staff was slow and awkward. Half the options on the menu were not available (including no orange juice and no bottled water) and the ones that were, they mixed up. Moreover, we waited to be served for 20 minutes and for the bill for 30 minutes and when it finally came - we had to wait for 30 more as the waiter dropped my card behind their fridge... The second time was a similar experience - it was a disaster getting to order. Again, half the options were not available. The waiter and manager refused to boil an egg for my two year old (only fried or scrambled) until I spoke with the head chef, and we waited a looong time for our food. Also quite pricey for what you get. Long story short, my family and I are never stepping foot in that place agai

If you enjoy eating New York style deli sandwiches, this is the place for you. Lovely sandwiches in various sizes ranging from small to 3XL I believe. My son had L while hubby took an XL. The pastrami was fantastic. Loved the fries too, very flavourful and its crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Unfortunately I tried a coney dog on that day and it didn't taste as awesome as the sandwiches. The hotdog was nothing very interesting and so were the beans.I also tried the clear soup on anothe occasion with the matska, wrong spelling I know, balls and that was delicious.Service was casual but great. The crew were polite and attentive. I would visit it again for sure
3
Well done Reuben sandwiches with great corned beef and pastrami. Nice pickles, salads and bread options as well as bagels. However, place is a bit cramped for the price being charged. (Around $25 for a regular sized Reuben sandwich) Still a good option for people in Singapore looking for this dish
5
Tried the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and it was awesome. They have one of the best bagels in town! Great ambience for gatherings (:
2
Waitress didn't attend well, had to self serve water. Food arrived discontinued and coffee took 15m to be brought.
Pretty disappointing brunch we had
4
Ordered the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and bagel. I would come back just for this. Reuben was good but the medium is more than enough to share.
5
This is not my first visit to Sacha & Sons. Their latkes are as good as before, however I note that the portions seemed to have gotten slightly smaller. The beef pastrami sandwich (on rye) was a hit with my friend. The meatball soup in chicken broth was average at best.The service from their staff at our visit was outstanding. My friend dropped his fork and it was swiftly replaced by a male staff, their response times (to taking orders/refills of water) were also better. I also much prefer their allowing us to have our orders taken at the table compared to requiring us to make our way to the counter to order. All in all another great dining experience
1
Firstly, I am a big fan of Sasha & Sons at Mandarin Gallery; I go often as love their products; and have written them great reviews before. However, what they are churning out at the F1 on the Padang is a disgrace and a terrible first impression to their brand if that is the first anyone experiences them. I know how good their proper deli is, so I know the vast difference in quality - but I am upset they would provide such poor product just to make a quick buck at the F1, to massive detriment of their brand in SG! I should of asked for my money back yesterday as I couldn't even swallow their pastrami bagel - was inedible!

The menu here at this restaurant modelled after the American deli, albeit at a premium, is heavily geared towards brunch-goers. The best dish we had was undoubtedly the Sesame Bagel with Plain Scrambled Eggs and Cream Cheese. The latke side order was a real letdown -- bland and stringy/dry. The Special Burger wasn't quite so special, so I would skip that. Draft beer is very affordable, so this is a good place for a rest and a drink(s). Will probably head back for brunch proper and try the Reuben sandwich next. There's good service to be had here, which was a good change from a lot of other cafe restaurants in Singapore. We pointed out to our server that there seemed to be a fruit fly problem -- they were descending on our beer and food during the meal. He assured us that they were aware and already on it, although having an electronic bug zapper would probably help
1
Had a reservation for 11am. Got there on time. Was told the next available table will be ours. Guess what??? We waited 40mins and did not get a table!!! When we made our reservation through chope, it was stated that the we might hv to give up our table if they needed it. Well, i guess they don't walk the talk. Reservation sys epic fail!!!! Not going back....ever! AND WE SPECIFICALLY DID NOT WANT BAR SEATING WHEN WE MADE THE RESERVATION!!
1
Made a booking for my colleague birthday lunch. Got all the way there to find the restaurant closed for private event. I asked the staff why they still accept reservations when they are closed for private events. No answer they could not br bothered. They still asked if I made reservations on the day itself as they check chope system yesterday. The date of my reservation do not matter. The fact is that if you are on this online platform the restaurant should check and chope should have email them of my reservation.
4
Have always been looking for a good thick pastrami Sandwich in spore. Finally found this place that serve tasty thick pastrami sandwichesThey have 5 size ranging from S,R,L,XL & XXL. I went all out & ordered XXL but sadly I was not blown away by the amount of meat (suppose to be 300g). Refer to photo.. the meat is not overflowing out from the sandwich.Thank goodness I didn't get the XL or will be disappointed. The food is good but expected more meat from their XXL portion
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant. The food was very good. My discerning friends were more than satisfied and that speaks volume. I want to compliment the staff. The pair of them did a really good job advising us, albeit it didnt come across correctly at first; we thot she didn't understand our orders - turned out she was trying to de-duplicate some of our orders. The service was prompt and sincere. Together with the good food that was served, we had a thoroughly enjoyable and stressless morning. Tip: portions not large for sharing. Just right for Asians. Maybe a tad small for bigger eaters. Good opening hours despite it being in a mall (which traditionally open later) and tolerant of young tykes.
2
The lunch menu did not provide a wide range and the meals were very expensive - at least 30% more than elsewhere
4
Not perfect in the NYC deli experience, but pretty close. The staff was super friendly and the coffee was excellent.
4
I had a plate worth 20$ for scrambled eggs and 2 pieces latkes. However I believe I will be back again for the simplicity and quality.
5
Could have their bagels all day long. Had the herbed cream cheese this time which was good, and my favourite chopped liver. Excellent breakfast!
5
Well located at Mandarin Gallery, which is the popular place for brunch. The restaurant is nicely renovated to give you a city hidden gem feel. For the food, try the bagel with cheese. It won't go wrong
4
I was super excited to try this place because I was born n raised in NY and have a soft spot for bagels. Sadly the bagels here only came in 2 flavors - pumpkin and sesame seed, and they were just average. I only ate half of my bagel. I guess they've localised the food a bit because the cream cheese was definitely asian-portioned. Cream cheese is not butter! In NY you get a much more generous serving. I do like the concept tho. The rest of the food was great. Salmon scrambled eggs was probably my top dish of the day. The fried potato with applesauce was a big weird for me. Might try a savoury option next time. Found this place thanks to Survival Chic.
5
Whenever I'm in Singapore, I always make time for a visit to Sacha & Sons. Top quality bagels, salmon, pastrami, roast beef. I'd recommend you reserve a table as they are insanely busy during peak times. Service is attentive and the price is okay when you consider the quality of the ingredients and the location.
3
We had the wine pairing selection -- sausage and chips and dips platter that went really well with Carmenere and Pinot wine -- and it was really good. The only downsides were the slow service (water was not served right away once we were seated) and the staff's product knowledge particularly on the wine needs improvement. I don't expect them to be experts on wine but at least they should be able to tell if wine is sweet or dry
5
If you're searching for your deli fix look no further. This is about as good as it gets in Singapore. In fact, in many ways, this may be better than the real thing... how you ask? Let me explain...This really isn't the traditional American deli experience you'll have in New York, Philly or any other American city, so don't come here expecting grubby surroundings and simple homemade sandwiches.It's all about the Instagram generation here. Even the iced tea is worth a photo and the sandwiches are all perfectly stacked. Everything just seems to be in the right place, contrived perhaps, but the idea here is to update and modernise the traditional experience. Prices also reflect this. Cost of raw materials obviously has a large part to play in all this because we just don't have a ready supply of good pastrami for example in South East Asia, so come with the right frame of mind and manage your expectations.Most importantly, it's comfortable, instagram worthy and the food has never disappointed me. Sometimes even making wonder... this could be better than the real thing.Oh. And they have gluten free bread available too for those sensitive stomachs who need their rueben fix
3
I am still going there after a while, but the prices have climbed higher after 2 years. I went there for lunch, and the lunch set half and half (half a sandwich and half a salad) has disappeared. It is the same price for lunch and dinner. The Bortch (beetroot soup) which was so good and rate in Singapore has disappeared. They have left the chope system of vouchers, so no reduction possible. 32sgd nett for a sandwich. On the plus side, they have 10sgd beers besides the 25sgd beer that no one was ordering. The American magazines (New Yorker, etc.) to read have disappeared and you now have the same magazines as at your hairdresser. The pastrami is still good, but it is expensive love. On the plus side: less queue, the prices have made clients go so it is not crowded as before. Love of pastrami is not cheap..
3
Had the classic roast beef sandwich on rye bread. The meat was well done medium rare. Perhaps the service staff could be more upbeat in their service, though they didn't do anything overtly wrong
5
Went here for breakfast and had a plain pancake with buttermilk syrup. Although you only get 1 pancake it was big and delicious! Hubby had a bagel with pastrami which was big for a regular size. Service was very efficient!
2
far too dry the meat and bread hard to bite in, when you pay S$10 to 15 at Katz's NYC and Langer's L.A., S$30 over is a rip-off, go at your own risk.
5
Always live thegood at Sacha & Sons and although the owners have changed, its maintained it great and high standard.

Bookings was made via Chope and that was convenient and seamless. The maÃ®tre d' greeted us and had our reservation on point - nice smiling face (very attractive and funky young girl).Then came the service, the waiters took our orders but the food came 45minutes after we ordered and it was not in sequence, a table ordered after us got their food prior to us. Didn't even bother offering us our drinks order first nor complimentary tap water whilst waiting and did I mean, we ordered drinks and took them 15minutes for a pot of tea with ice and latte... :-(That said, the waiter was kind of unprofessional by muttering snide remarks to his colleagues about us putting the sugar syrup dispenser (very small container of 20ml) into the EMPTY tea pot - I thought this was considerate so he doesn't need to juggle a lot of plates, cups and saucers. But by muttering his unprofessional remarks let me knows he was rather catty and I understood what he said even though it was in his mother tongue language. That said, my first and last time visiting this restaurant - I'd rather go to other brunch location - i.e. no love lost, maybe just a customer and whoever that's reading this review. :-
3
i was rather looking forward to a nice relaxed lunch with my family. insted it was apparent that whilst the staff were friendly and polite they were very understaffed for their busiest hour. It took them 20 minutes before they took our order and another 40 minutes to deliver it. There was a fly in the sugar and the water in the tea pot was delivered lukewarm. i didnt really taste my food as i had passed the hunger limit. my coffee was good though when it arrived. but the staff definetely need more help
3
Came on a Sunday morning under a group of 5. Waited 40 mins for our food to come and we could even see that other customers after us got their food before us! Was also not served water even though the other tables clearly got it. When the food finally came, it was average at best. Given the price of the food (8.20$ for a pot of tea ?!) one would expect more.Disappointing as there were higher expectations for this.
5
A lunch brunch spot where you could happily come back every week and work your way through the menu. Awesome bagels with a full array of New York deli style sides this is comfort food at its best. There is always a queue but well worth the wait. G
5
They changed their menu. I didn't like that but it is good business sense. They now provide service to take orders and payments at your table. Compared to before when you have to go to the counter. My fav item is the salmon bagel. Roasted pumpkin seeds bagel. Toasted, with herbed cream cheese, topped with mountain of smoked salmon, red onions and capers. Ate this 10 times in a year and never let me down. Today i shall try the egg white scrambled eggs with smoke flavour chicken sausage. Comes with a bagel so I'm having another favourite of mine, the roasted jalapeno cream cheese. The server supervisor lady remembered my order from a week ago. Amazing.
3
The food was good overall. The Sacha salad was a letdown. It was basically a garden salad with Japanese dressing that cost $18. We were a party of 4. 2 of our dishes came about 30 mins before our friends. So, by the time 2 of us finished our dishes, another one came and the last one came 15 mins later....
1
Waited long time for food and service was very bad... Very upsetting experience. Food is very good but the bad service experience just killed the whole experience
1
Awful people they don't understand basics customer service. How to greet. How to take an order. How to not spill water on you. How to check on your order. How to smile. How to get the bill. Spatial awareness.
4
Delicious cuts of meat overall, but definitely the best place to get beef pastrami in SG. It is the only thing i order here since i discovered it.
2
Food was cold and felt like leftovers. Price seems bit too high for the ingredients used.
Nothing really stands out.
2
Long wait for table for 4 and for our foods. One order was almost forgotten till a waitress came to salvage and deliver on priority.
3
we went for a brunch on Sunday. food i would say average, but the coffee were not very good.
dont know if we will go there again
5
Absolutely love the Classic Deli with pastrami!! Table service now available, which is a nice touch.
1
I liked their foods and services very much and hightly recommended to my friends/colleagues. Now, they have changed the menu, which is no longer that attractive as before. And I've made the reservation and showed up on time but still need to wait for more than 20 minutes. The service is very slow when it was not even full. Very dissappointed and may not visit again
2
My first visit to Sasha & Sons in Dec 16 left me craving for the wonderful bagels and bloody marys so i booked another visit on Chope for lunch. When my husband and I arrived at our 12.30pm booking, there were quite a few people waiting for their tables as well. The manager saw me, but ignored me and helped to settle the other foreigners until i called out to him that i have a reservation. Then he told me that my table was not ready and had to wait a bit. We were seated 10mins later and as i stood up to go to the counter to order my food, the manager called out to me that the staff will come to take my order instead (at the same time he beckoned a waitress to come to my table). So we waited. And waited. In the end, i had to call out to the manager again for my order to be taken. Of course, we ordered the bloody marys but were informed that they no longer sell that. It was so disappointing! In the end, my husband settled for the draft beer and we also ordered our usual bagels with cream cheese and reuben sandwich.The drinks took 30mins to arrive. The bagels came and i realised that they were different. They were not as doughy and chewy as before and had the texture of airy bread instead. I asked the manager but he maintained the recipe hasn't change. In any case, my appetite was ruined and i asked for the rest of the bagels to be packed. That took another 20mins. My husband saw the bagels sitting at the counter top all along; no one bothered to pack it until we mentioned we have to leave already.Suffice to say, the service blows. I have no idea why the service is so horrible despite having at least 4 staff excluding the manager. Even if the service sucks, at least the food should have seom redeeming factors right? I have no idea why the wonderful bloody mary was taken off the menu nor why the bagels do not taste like the famous bagels anymore but i am sure if this keeps up, there won't be another visit
4
Always a pleasure dining here and food quality never ceases to impress. Noticed changes to the menu and miss not having bubbles anymore!Service not the best this time around and would benefit from more resource being made available. Hostess fabulous but needs her team to support! Menu also needs to clarify if the dish comes with all items...ie. eggs with the breakfast to avoid confusion!All that said, still a very pleasant experience
3
Sacha salad was well-balanced. Pancake was nice and fluffy. Bagel was average. Overall, an average experience. I would not return.
5
Good service that accommodated us even though we were early. Food was good but slightly pricy but service was excellent.
4
Overall is good. Only find it too noisy for me to enjoy my meal with my friends.
Food is good, portion is just nice.
4
I was a bit apprehensive on the idea of a NY style deli and prices looked pricey for the what you get. I was pleasantly surprised when the food came and there is a substantial amount. The bagel was light and crunchy. Salmon and scrambled eggs was really fantastic. Coffee was also good. Looking forward to being back again soon
3
Ok, let's start about the good things.First off, the service which was friendly and accommodating without having that "get out of my face" feeling afterwards. The waitresses seemed to enjoy their job genuinely or damn good actresses and helped us effortlessly in our requests.Second is the quality of food. We ordered- Pastrami Sandwich XXL- Pancake - Side of additional pickles- Iced tea (forgot the flavor)The quality of the food in general was very good. The pastrami should have been the highlight. Although it was cure nicely with a good texture, it was trumped by the pancake which was delicious and fluffy. So good that we ordered a second one.The mustard on the sandwich was too pungent for my taste but that's personal and I'm sure others would enjoy it.The iced tea was served nicely: The teabag (with tealeaves and herbes) were put in a small can of hot water and the can itself was but on top of a larger can with ice cubes so that you can make your own iced tea. Nice touch!Why I only give this place an Average rating is the poor value for money. Listen, I know Singapore is an expensive place and on top of that, the location of this particular place is Orchard. I get it: it will be pricey. Regardless, I felt I paid too much for what we got with the worst example being charged $4 (or even more) for the additional pickles which were two (yes, two) pickles sliced in half.While the decor of the place looked good, it lacked personality or atmosphere. It wasn't inviting despite that they obviously put good money in it. Overall, the quality of the food (hail their pancake!) was good to very good but the poor value for money will probably prevent me from being a regular to that place - even though I love deli food and the lack of alternatives in this cit
4
Just make it short review :1. The reservation system should be easier (register name,mobile phone number, they auto text you for the table and queque number..) I am too old for this :)2. Service was nice. Although busy at least the captain and waiter were smiling and communicative. They quite patient explaining the regular and whats recomended. 3. Ordered reuben with pastrami (as advised). Turns out to be jackpot. Its sacha's signature. Nicely done. For me it was one of the best sandwich in sgp so far.4. Price was bit pricey. Food was ok but was billed for 12 sgd for ice tea. Must be something wrong with my sight when I read the menu :)5. Ambience was quite nice. Always packed up and bit noisy but still ok to have chat here. People actually came for the food. Overall : quite nice..will definetely back for the food (but not for the reservation :
3
This used to be my favorite place for pastrami (other stuff too, but really the pastrami). But its gone down hill. Gone is the laser focus on product quality. The menu has a lot of other ho-hum items that have been added, but people came here for the meats and the foods they couldn't get in other places. Also, the counter looks barren. The display case has two cakes and a bunch of smoked salmon packets. Really?A year back, I would have easily given them a 5 stars. But now, I feel like the people who are running the place, don't know the essence of what they are selling. We had scrambled eggs and it lacked salt. Thats not the kind of food you get from a place where people care. A year back, it was impossible to get a table here. Now, not so much: you can walk in most times. And I predict that if they keep losing their regulars (like me), I doubt they will even have what they have now, for long

It's billed as an authentic New York deli, and since we have fond memories of eating at some of the great delis in New York, we went to check out Sacha & Sons. I ordered a regular pastrami on rye and got a few pieces of unremarkable meat on bread that was better ignored. I have to say, though, that the space and staff were nice here, which is something you wouldn't expect in New York
4
Made a reservation for 11:30am. Seated only at 11:55am. At 12:30pm, the manager started hovering over our table, and started to clear our plates even though people were still eating. I am fine if they seated us on time and told us we needed to vacate the table at xx time but don't hover. It makes it very uncomfortable. Food is great though and will still come back for that

We went here last Saturday at around 9AM. We ordered the classic deli pastrami, grilled reuben pastrami and smoked salmon bagel. It was our first time being there so we didn't know about the food serving time. It took about 20-25mins for the food to be served which was okay because we were not in such a rush to get our breakfast done. Then my friend ordered a flat white tom during our meal but it took forever for the restaurant to make it. We needed to get back to our room so we asked for the bill and to have the coffee to go. Still the coffee was not yet done even after our bill has been settled and after numerous follow ups to the staffs. We needed to wait at the coffee counter to make sure they make our order.Well overall, food is good here but they need to up their game for the service. I would recommend getting a sandwich here if you're in no rush
4
Captain was rather surly and curt. Atmosphere too noisy and unpleasant as tables were placed too near to each other
5
Nice place very friendly staff and their food is wonderful and fresh the only negative thing is that its hidden and not easy to find. Highly recommended if you miss the taste of good wholesome deli sandwich so make sure to look for it .
5
I have continually eaten at Sacha & Sons and have taken some of my friends there. I have now discovered they too have become frequent patrons in their own right. You would expect nothing less from the best Reuben in Singapore. :)
4
I eat there on a quiet Monday night. The food was great as was the service. The waitress was particularly accommodating to special requests with food and friendly with my friends' toddler. The wait staff knew the menu well and happily made recommendations.
5
Good food, good service. The bagel was awesome, and staff were knowledgable in giving food recommendations.
4
The food is fantastic. Great ambience.
Definitely worth another trip back. Have recommended to my friends and they love it!
5
One of our favorite restaurants in Singapore. A real authentic, comfortable experience. It feels like you are in New York.
4
This is my go-to place for the best Reuben sandwiches in Singapore. Friendly service has improved with wait staff taking diners' orders at their tables and billing them after the meal, as opposed to the previous practice if taking orders and collecting payment at the till before delivering the food to diners.

I convinced my boyfriend to have brunch this Sunday at Sacha and Sons, after reading many positive reviews about the "most authentic NY delicatessen in Singapore". It was his first time trying NY deli food, so naturally we were looking forward to it. We arrived at 13:20 and there was already a very long queue. We took this as a good sign and left our name and number in the queuing system they have. It told us the waiting time would be about 15~30 minutes before it would call us. We killed our time with coffee, and a little venture around the building. 45min...then 50min...No call. After almost one hour we returned to see what the situation was, only to see that there was no longer a queue, and the diner was half empty. We informed the manager there that we had been waiting over an hour, to which he responded in a very dismissive tone and brushed our comment aside, ushering us into the restaurant as if we were a complete nuisance. It was such a turn-off. Needless to say my boyfriend was furious by the disrespectful mannerism of the manager. At the end of our meal, I suppose the manager realised how unhappy my boyfriend was, because he tried to butter him up with a painfully obvious fake attitude. It was distasteful. Food was pleasant but the service makes us never want to return again. Be more mindful of your manager's way of "service", Sacha and Sons. It's extremely disappointing
5
Second visit. I came especially for the Reuben with pastrami and it was soooooo satisfying! My piccolo didn't disappoint either, but my friend's did. Mine was smooth and fragrant, hers was bitter... and we ordered our coffees just 10-15 minutes apart! The side of coleslaw tasted off too.I'll go back for the Reuben, hopefully sooner than later
4
Good place for brunch - anything on their menu with pastrami is worth a try. Usually a bit of a wait to be seated in the weekend.
4
I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. Been to Wild honey a few times and heard of Sacha and Sons. Remind me back when I was in US having breakfast on the weekend with my bagel and cream cheese.
5
Love the service!! Delicious soups and main course.. although the valentine menu's dessert could be improved. Nevertheless, i am satisfied and will certainly recommend this place to friends
5
The steak was nicely cooked and the staff are very friendly. Would definitely come back again, and would recommend to friends and family
5
Another wonderful brekkie. Tried something new and never a disappointment. Will look forward to visiting again soon.
5
Still one of my must go place in Sg, love the ambience, juicy pickles just perfect for lunch, brought different friends here and they never complain
4
Ordered a XL Reuben! 300g of pastrami was a bliss to bite into! The sauerkraut was fresh and but the beef was a little dry. Still, awesome flavor!
4
We went back after having good experiences with the food there. But they were in the midst of changing menus, so we did not manage to get some items.One bonus is that they have gluten-free selections, and my wife was very happy with the Pastrami Latkes
5
Sacha has always been a unique go to for me and partner.Brilliant ambience, authentic NY menu, affordable prices, excellent attentive sincere service each time!We love the sliced pastrami, bagels and the New York ambience. And guess what, they have a new menu coming up too!Highly reccomend

Being one of the few New York delicatessens in Singapore selling Jewish cuisine, I had long wanted to pay Sacha & Sons a visit to try their sesame bagels baked in-house and Reuben sandwiches served with coleslaw and pickle. I ordered Smoked Salmon Latkes with Salmon Pearls ($21) and a Reuben Pastrami Bagel. I'm not a huge bagel fan because most that I've tried tend to be too hard and chewy, but the bagel here was nicely toasted and had a relatively light crisp to it. I also enjoyed the homemade coleslaw--none of that KFC-style slaw drenched in dressing! The latkes, which are fried potato pancakes, were a little too crispy, probably because they were fried too long. But the dish was saved by the generous portion of smoked salmon, while the pearls added an extra dimension to each bite.The restaurant, which is located at Mandarin Gallery, is a good place to have a nice long meal. The service was excellent as well, with the servers attentive in refilling our water and serving us with a smile. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes
3
The food was tasty, but a bit overpriced. $75 on 1 reg sandwich and 1 extra large, no sides. The ambiance was good. Service was OK.
3
Had dinner at 8pm. They ran out of latkes although it was still quite early. Big portions. A bit pricey
4
Friendly and Attentive Staff.
Food was well prepared and presented nicely.
Quality of food was good.
3
I was expecting a better food and services from them due to the overwhelming review however it didn't reach my expectation as their actual food wasn't what I expected and the server wasn't attentive as well.
4
3rd visit to this place. Great bagels, pickles, latkes etc. Brisket, pastrami and reuben are very good indeed. Service is good and people are polite.
3
Enjoyed the food but turned off when one server approached my party and asked if there was anything else we'd like to order otherwise there are people waiting to be seated. I mentioned to her that I wasnt informed beforehand that I can only keep the table (looked at my watch) for 60 mins. She tried to redeem herself but it left a poor impression. We were almost done with the meal then but my pot of tea was just halfway done. Disappointing end to an otherwise okay experience
3
Read so much about this place, saw so many photos on Instagram etc. Visited with friends, there wasn't much "service" as we had to go to the counter to place our orders etc. Staffs weren't that friendly. Food was nice but overall, kind of overpriced and no wow factor. Would not return again
4
Their pastrami, pickles, mustard and bagels are from another universe. Portions are big and the quality of other dishes we tried was also great (schnitzel, roastbeef, rye bread, coleslaw. However, their service is far from being personal. Going to a such place, I'd imagine being greeted and taken care of better than in a hawker centre. The lady at the counter was rude keeping asking me what table are we like a broken record (tables have no numbers written on them) and when I asked for more information on one of their dishes she didn't bother answering my question and just listed the ingredients written on the menu
5
Just had the most amazing smoked salmon, herb cream cheese with capers in a most amazing pumpkin seeded toasted bagel. Had it before and this time just reminded me how wonderful my choice was. is. Sacha has a simple concept menu which they excel in serving.
3
We ordered a pastrami sandwich and a salmon and cream cheese bagel + 2 cokes. They brought me just bagel with cream cheese (probably the casheer didn't get my order right) and the pastrami was good but nothing special.We paid 52 Singapore dollars - way to expensive for what we ordered.The place is nice and self service
5
The Sacha roast beef was really good. I ordered it with Bagel (would be better to pair it with Rye but good enough!) the roast beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce and toppings complemented the whole taste.
would definitely come back again for more
4
This is a New York diner style restaurant which serves amazing New York style sandwiches. I had the roast beef and mustard sandwich which was so tasty. Only let down was the restaurant doesn't do french fries. Please have fries next time!
5
Yup. One of the sexiest sandwiches to be had in sunny Singapore.
Hidden within a hotel shopping/restaurant annex, Sacha&Sons serve up an exciting menu for all ages.
This is a great place for a meal or just to chill over some coffee and sandwiches.
4
Food is excellent, the only down point was not bringing all orders at the same time. We were 4 people, 3 orders came first and the last one quite some time later...
4
The food was not bad. Service was excellent :) It serves quintessential NYC food and its really tasty.
4
Portions were generous- we left stuffed and satisfied. Would definitely return again. Service was excellent as well.
4
A return visit after some time, and quality of food remains :) service was accommodating to my order changes too. Other than the slightly soggy the bread and stingy pickles, it was a great meal!
5
Caught up with friends over dinner at Sacha & Sons. Must say that they have pretty good ambience, quiet and chill... Service was prompt and servers were really friendly. We had the grilled reuben sandwich, latke with salmon and smoked salmon bagel with herb creme cheese that were all good! :)
2
My Friend highly recommended this place and we went for a weekday lunch. The sandwiches were popular but very overpriced. The beef was Super salty. Cucumber dill salad was nice and refreshing. There are better places for lunch than this. It's all marketing and branding I Guess.
4
Been coming here since the early days. Still the best place in SG to grab a good bagel. Pleasantly surprised by the service this visit; made a reservation via Chope but had to change cover number at the last min. Hosteps took it in her stride when we arrived also gave us a good seat by the window even though the restaurant was busy. Will be back.
3
Food is good. I love their pastrami Reuben. Wish it was a full service restaurant though given the prices.
3
Overall nice place and tasty bagel. Not crazy about this place since you have to order at the counter and queue. Food is brought to the tables from waitress. Nice place but nothing special.
5
I recently had breakfast at this restaurant and was very impressed.
The menu is very New York deli inspired and very authentic. Meals are a decent size and you can tell a lot of love has gone into created the dishes.
Will be back again!
5
When ask about the pastrami, the person in charge asked the chef to come out and cut a slice for us to try and explained to us about the beef. And give us good recommendations on the meat to chose. The beef is marvellous. Will definitely recommend to friends. Good food good service. Cosy comfortable environment

Sometimes I'll do anything for a good bagel. Throw in crispy latkes and you almost own my heart. So I was beyond thrilled to discover this gem hidden on the 3rd floor of the Mandarin Gallery next to the very busy (and apparently owned by the same folks) Wild Honey. And the bagels ARE good! But they have some serious problems.  On my first visit a few weeks back I ordered the bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, onions and tomatoes. I was beyond excited as I miss these foods terribly. The bagel came in two choices; sesame or pumpkin seed (???) It was fresh and had that chewy texture down. However, everything after that went downhill. There was an immense amount of salmon (I ate about 1/5th) however there were about 3 capers, 2 tiny onion slices and 1 sad green tomato. I asked for a bit more capers and eventually got a tiny dish with a few more but by then I was about finished.  I returned this week with my daughter who, like me, was beside herself with excitement at having our old family favorites on the menu. However, the service was appalling. I'm sure I ordered from the owner or manager. As veg options are limited I asked if the salmon in the scrambled eggs with onions and salmon could be switched out for avo. Since you order at the counter this is a loud exchange while standing in front of the entire restaurant. He said it was fine but he would simply order the side of plain eggs and a side of avocado. I asked (to clarify) that it would include the caramelized onions. He was very rude and confirmed, "Of course!" When I paid (in advance) he read the order back and I confirmed again about the onions. Guess what?... Order arrives & no onions. It took no less than 5 arguments with various waitresses and again with the manager who assured me that they were 1.in the order, 2. never ordered 3. on my plate 4. mixed in... and there were NO Fricking ONIONs. Sorry, but seriously. My daughter was stressed. It was very embarrassing. Ultimately they realized there were indeed no onions in the plate or on the table so they took it back in the kitchen, sliced the scramble horizontally and threw in some sweet, grey "caramelized" onions and returned them to me, the entire dish now lukewarm.  If that wasn't enough, our order of latkes had still not arrived. Even after we shared the eggs, bagel, coffee and oj and they STILL hadn't arrived was I told that they had in fact just run out of latkes and were making a new batch. SERIOUSLY?  We waited another 30 minutes- honestly- and I had to again get the owner involved. When they did finally arrive they were delicious. Truly- crispy on the outside, tender inside. With nice apple sauce and sour cream just as they should be. He even brought me a coffee on the house which was a nice gesture given the terrible service, but a bit off the bill would have been more appreciated.  If you're still thinking of going I would say bring a good book or your phone fully charged and prepare to hunt Pokemon or catch up on Facebook or whatever you do while you pass the time. The service is terrible, it's loud and not very friendly. However when they do bring your food it will be a rare treat in Singapore- Jewish Deli food that really does taste like home

I saw a poster for this deli as I was getting on the elevator to go to my hotel room.So, the next day I gave it a try for both breakfast and lunch.The staff was very friendly. It was a Sunday and the place was nearly full both times I went in.The smoked salmon and cream cheese with onions (I had them hold the capers) was decent but not top shelf and not worth the money they charged. (S$ 16 or 18 - can't remember exactly.) They did not serve it with lemon wedges but when I asked they arrived quickly. I expected a plain bagel since they did not specify but I got some multi topping thing which was a letdown. S$ 9 for a small glass of fresh grapefruit juice also seemed excessive but the quality was good.For lunch I was torn between their stated specialty meats and meatloaf. I may have picked wrong with the meatloaf because it had an odd consistency (way too soft.) The taste was average at best. Similar to my morning experience it was way overpriced.I would not return given the mid-grade food taste and high prices. Way too many good options within a five minute stroll from the hotel.For lunch I ha
1
I used to patronize this deli a lot, but after I finished one particular meal, I noticed a baby cockroach running around on my plate. It was the same color as the sesame seeds, and that is why I didn't notice it at first. We immediately flagged the waitress, and her only response was that 'We are having a problem with this, and we tried everything, but the problem won't go away.' Her response is not satisfactory to us at all. Since the problem 'won't go away', it is only fair that I write this review and warn everyone
4
I've actually visited this place thrice and I love it for daring to be different (somewhat). It's under the same folks who set up Wild Honey, but the focus here is on New York Jewish delicatessen. And bagels. Bagels are the main carb here, and Sacha & Sons does them well. It's hard to go wrong with a bagel paired with classic cream cheese spread and smoked salmon, all while sitting in a dim cosy restaurant. Portions are HUGE even if they don't look it. Just remember that bagels are very dense and they are generous with the cured meats and smoked salmon. Always order less than you think you need and add more if you're still hungry. We were a party of 5 and we had the smoked fish platter (comes with 4 types of smoked fish toppings and 3 bagels) with 1 additional bagel and 1 latke with beef pastrami. We couldn't even finish the platter but it was all very delicious. Well worth the trip especially since there aren't many bagel places in SG. Prices can be a bit steep, but This is adequately compensated by decent portion sizes.
5
My friend and I tried the grilled Reuben sandwich, it indeed lived up to its hype! Food aside, the staff were exceptionally attentive - apart from timely refill of drinks and checking on our needs, they were all smiley and friendly when it comes to acceding to our requests for assitance in photo taking!
3
Saw this joint advertised on the local Singapore tourist TV channel in my hotel and thought it would be a nice place for a feed and some GOOD coffee. It took some finding as it is on the 2nd or 3rd floor of a building. The coffee was great. The NY style Rubeun Sandwich (complete with sauerkraut, mustard and pickle) was very average for the price. Would I go there again ???... only for the coffee
4
Atmosphere was great. Enjoyed the friendly service. Pastrami didn't blow me away. Hollandaise sauce was too buttery. Shredded Potato was too hard. Wouldn't pay full price for that. pricey breakfast. But I enjoyed great company and a good chat there.
5
The perfect place for a nice and yummy brunch. Bagel was superb with the pastrami scrambled egg. Hash corn beef was very good too.
5
I have regularly attended Sacha and Sons and always enjoy my meals, atmosphere and the very good service. I will continue to patron S&S because its one of a kind in Singapore.
4
Great food, prompt service!
It's my 3rd time here but I ordered the Latkas again as usual. It never fails to please.
My friend's liver toast was a tad too strong on the liver taste for my liking...
3
Had an early midweek lunch, pretty underwhelming, plenty of staff but you had to queue to order and was faced with one of the dourest customer service staff people imagineable. Both our meals were no better than ok, at pretty hefty prices. Could do much better
4
My brother came here and hated it but I loved it - so opinion is a bit mixed. Where else in Singapore would I be able to get the typical New York Deli- = except in a much nicer environment. They have the usual Jewish food; pastrami; conrned beef etc etc . It is wonderful to come here when one misses or craves the Deli experience
3
Opinion latkes was cold hence less crunchy to chew on. $20 for bagel and scramble eggs is rather overpriced. There is little service involved too as we had to order at counter and pay first.
5
I am a big fan of NYC delis. This place is totally up to it. Order the extra large pastrami and share it with a friend to have a real NY experience. I will have to come back ten times to try every item I want on the menu. Only issue, this is not diet food.
4
A real New York deli with a pastrami to die for. Great little place that serves wonderful food. I had the Pastrami on a Bagel took the big portion option - delicious but I was bursting at the end so much meat. It was a toss up between the Pastrami or the Ruben, wish I had space for both but next time it will have to be the Reuben.This is a must try and go back again and again for mor
4
Was recommended to give it a try as Wild Honey was full during my visit. Definitely a great idea!The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was impressed and in love with the interior. Totally my kind of thing. Staff was really attentive and helpful which made my dining experience pleasant. Prices may be kinda steep, but it's definitely worth every penny spent
4
We share a grilled pastrami on rye, avocado latkes and a sour cherry strudel. Excellent pastrami sandwich but a little pricey.
5
Been back many times, stable quality and excellent service, absolute favorite is the hash cored beef. Could do with a little less oil but nonetheless, still pretty good.
4
Although a little on the pricey end, the food did not disappoint - crunchy latkes and hearty reubens made for a very satisfying dinner! We will be back!
4
This restaurant has all the look and fittings of a typical New York or Montreal deli. Service is fast but if you are made to order at the counter, then would you be paying a 10% service charge? I would pay half of that.Nevertheless, the food is of the highest quality. The pastrami with bagel is divine. Corned beef with rye is another favourite I see being ordered frequently. Prices are rather steep but if you are stuck in drab humid Singapore and need some comfort food from a far far away land, then this is the place
5
Absolutely craving a Reuben and it did not disappoint. All of our meals were great, and great service and attention to our 1 year old. Great pickle!
4
Odd location on a non-descript floor of an average orchard road mall. While looking at the menu- the enterprising hostess got the chef to give us a couple taster slices of pastrami and we were sold. Portions- which in singapore can be disappointing- are correct at s&s. This is how they load up the meat in a NY deli! Meat is awesome- and that's the important thing. Only comment is the latkes could be slightly better- a bit too hard. Give me more!!!
4
The pastrami in the Reuben was good and the bagels had a deliciously chewy, sweet, texture and crunch from the pumpkin seeds. Coffee was ok, latkes were quite oily, but they were very generous with the smoked salmon and the chicken schnitzel was nothing to write home about. New York cheesecake was quite dense. The place transports you right back to NY but be prepared to wait for a table, especially on weekends. We waited for almost an hour.
5
This is my third visit but I was solo this time, and decided to try something new. While meatloaf probably isn't new, it's not something I've had for a very long time, so the sandwich option looked good. And it didn't disappoint. Coupled with a nice pale ale it was a very good lunch. It was around 14:00 so pretty quiet and the building next door was undergoing some maintenance which was a bit annoying but that's temporary. The staff/manager was super fast at getting me settled and fed. A great meal and I'll be taking the family there again
4
The cafe was a sister restaurant of the next door Wild Honey, taking over the space formerly occupied by Wild Honey. It offers New York style Bagel sandwiches. The place was decorated with comfortable armchairs and dim lightings around. Order was taken at the cashier with payments in order. Do take note of your table when placing order. Food will be served to you.During weekdays, there wass Half & Half set available during 11am - 3pm (excludes weekends & Public holidays). It consisted of half serving of salad or soup + half serving of sandwich. I selected Grilled Reuben sandwich ($20++) for the set.Topup $2++ for Smoked Trout Salad. The salad was quite thick and creamy, although it was a bit jelat for me after a few mouthfuls. The sandwich came with a choice of either pastrami or corned beef, which I selected corned beef. With a choice between rye or brioche for the sandwich, I selected the white bread as the staff told me that it was softer. The sandwich was also packed with swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and russian dressing. It was quite chunky and meaty. It was served with pickle and coleslaw. The pickle was quite crunchy with a kind of sweetness. The coleslaw was light and crunchy.Overall the meal was filling and nice. The place was cozy and quite during lunch time
4
I had brunch with a couple of friends at Sacha & Sons. Tried the bagels with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, which comes in a huge portion. The bagel texture is just right for me, not too tough yet dense enough to appreciate its flavor. If you are not so hungry, I will recommend sharing a plate first before ordering more food
4
I enjoyed the coffee and the friendly obliging service. Not too over the top' just cost and warm. Food was good too. Will definitely go back especially for the bagels!
5
Bagels are a must try here, sweet and savoury options are available. Slightly hard to locate the place
5
You can't go wrong with Sacha and Sons. Very constituent and the quality is fabulous. I have been here over ten times and consisting enjoy the experience.
4
I have no comment on the service rendered during my visit. However bagel is particularly dry and hard. Perhaps it is too rough for my liking. Otherwise, it is a pleasure experience of visitation.
4
My reservation for 6 on a packed Friday night was smooth. Given the location, price and quality, I was initially surprised to learn that ordering was to be done at the counter cashier. However it worked out great for payment as my group went Dutch!
4
The seasme bagel was really good. It was served warm and I added the cream cheese. The pumkin bagel was good but a tad pale in comparison. The pastrami was not salty and tasted just right
3
Located in the Mandarin hotel shopping gallery makes this place a constantly busy spot. We've had chicken schnitzel and grilled rouben. The sandwitches were good, especially the beef, but bit tasteless, dry, instead of being "juicy or melting" which is the case in good NY delis. The rye bread we got served was in thick slices, drenched with oil and stale. The grilled rouben was also filled with lots of sour kraut and melted cheese which made it a dish exceptionally heavy to digest. Hudge, massive portions, I couldn't eat half of my sandwich. All together nice spot, inexpensive but I must say I really suffered from indigestion after the cheese and sauerkraut combination, so I would suggest mustard or lighter relish, or different dish all together. Very nice service and helpful service, but unfortunately not my kind of place.
1
The roast beef deli sandwich consisted of a few slices of beef, slapped in mustard and placed between two pieces of bread. I'm sure anyone can do better than that! We also ordered a Friday special set that cost $35++. Starters consisted of a slab of liver on a miserable small piece of white toast. Mains was a beef stew of sorts that tasted over-peppered. Beef was dry and hard. Our set came with a choice of wine or beer. And the restaurant was out of beer at 7pm on a Friday night!
2
Made a reservation at Sacha & Sons and ordered the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, pumpkin seed bagels with strawberry cream cheese and latke & smoked salmon. thought the scrambled eggs were fluffy and lovely but the latke was greasy and doesn't take fresh. No service as we had to get in line to order, and clarify the menu with the cashier, and no attentive service from the waiters.
5
I was there for lunch last week and totally enjoyed the food and their service! One of the waitress who saw that I am pregnant, came over to recommend what's good for me. She also told me which dish to avoid. I particularly like their sliced pastrami, scrambled with smoked salmon and sesame bagels! For dessert, we didn't like the blintzes, it was very blend and thick. The cheesecake was ok. I will definitely be back again for more bagels and perhaps some wine too, after I give birth
4
We had the meat platter and the salad platter this ime. They are very generous with the portions of meat. All cuts were tasty & tender. Delicious.
5
Well, had a couple of friends of mine join me me at Sachs and Sons and as typical the food was great. Can't wait till return there inn Sunday for father's day.
4
We arrived on a Sunday evening at 730pm and was surprised that the place was so empty!! Placed our orders at the cashier and I wanted egg white scrambled. The cashier was happy to oblige. Service met expectations and the entire feel of the cafe was very cosy and nice. Food wise, it was not too bad but portions were generous and we loved that!
4
A good deli, based on New York's Katz. Decent menu. Good sized portions. But with some omissions - new green cucumber, cinnamon and raisin bagel and soup with kreplach to name a few. Sour cherry strudel excellent. Good location in Mandarin Gallery at heart of Orchard Road. Worth a visit. Best to book ahead
3
I've been missing heavy-duty, proper (i.e. "non subways") sandwiches since leaving the US, so I was pretty curious when I saw "Sasha" pop up on my Tripadvisor.Located at the old (gimmicky) WildHoney on Orchard Mandarin, it's a pretty venue if you don't mind being inside a dark mall. I ordered the $22 "roast beef and chicken liver" sandwich. It was ok. Quite a bit of meat (if some very chewy), though nothing really spectacular for a twenty bucks sandwich. The venue rentals probably plays a big part, I would consider it more often in a less posh location at $15.
4
I went to this place a week ago. One of my friend posted the pic of pastrami sandwich with n his fb and it's look so tempting. I ordered the same and it was really good. This place is almost the best pastrami sandwich that I could get in Asia. The meat was so tender and juicy. The bread was fluff and nice taste. The service could be improve.. To Management >> sent your crews here to learn how to be friendly and attentive from Wild Honey the shop next to you. I believe it's the same owner.
3
This resto was recommended by my friend who had enjoyed an amazing Reuben sandwich. The original one consists of corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing, grilled between slices of rye bread. In Sacha & Sons you can choose between corned beef and pastrami. As they are famous for their pastrami I decided to go ahead with this choice. When the sandwich arrived I was a bit disappointed by the look of it. The bread looked like soaked in oil (it did not taste like butter) and not really crunchy just kind of wet. Pastrami was full of pepper that I did not anticipate. I also don;t like pepper but I understand some people would appreciate it. Other than that it was not particularly tasty. Saurkraut has no taste either. It was just a little bit of it and it tasted as somebody washed it to make sure it is not sour at all. I was not sure what was the point of it. Coleslaw was served on the side. There was some kind of yoghurt dressing on it - which made it tasteless as well. In general, it was not worth SGD 22 for an average tasting sandwich. It is possible they adjusted the recipe since my friend went there but the place was full so I guess other people like oil soaked bread with heavily peppered pastrami. I am not the fan though.Additionally, there were plenty of toddlers in the restaurant. As the space is open shrieking kids are pretty audible which makes it a bit difficult to enjoy your time. We ordered food at the same time but we all got the same thing at different times, but we needed to wait approximately 30 minutes for the first order to be served

We were attracted by the ambiance, which was nice. But when we tried to order, we were informed that we needed to go to the cashier and order there, and pay the bill, and the food would come. The food and wine did indeed come and it was pretty good, though it did not measure up to a real New York deli as the corned beef and pastrami were a little skimpy. And being charged for service seemed a little cheeky since we did most of the work ourselves. But the staff were pleasant, and we enjoyed the meal. This is a fairly rare cuisine in Singapore, which added to its interest
1
Food might be OK, a restaurant is not only that! When you are welcome without any smile, employees do not show any interest in what they are doing, and finally after 10 minutes looking at the whole menu you hear that "this is not available", you feel like you are not in the right place.Hopefully this Fareed is not the owner and you can change for a more obliging person taking orders!Mathie

Bagels here worth a try, even though they are slightly pricey. The sesame buns are so delish, with herb cream cheese, their scrambled eggs ans smoked salmon. Eggs are slightly salty, and the salmon chopped up in an unsightly manner.
4
Had the pastrami sandwich and salmon omelette. The cream cheese with the bagel was fantastic! Pastrami was pretty good too
5
Ate here a couple of times in 3 days. The soup is fantastic, the bagels are great, smoked salmon is generous in its' serving.
3
Prices on the website did not reflect actual prices at the restaurant. Expect to pay 4-6 dollars more. and then theres service charge.
4
Short of the hiccup at the service counter where our order chit wasn't printed (the staff at the counter seemed extremely distracted and slightly curt) and not attended to until we asked, everything else was great.
3
2nd visit and tried pastrami sandwich and mushroom soup this time. Soup was good but a bit too peppery. Tried both the classic deli and grilled Reuben pastrami. We prefer the grilled Reuben version though our top choice would still be roast beef. The smoked and heavily seasoned pastrami not exactly my type of food. Perfect service as usual.
4
Had a great rubens pastrami on a mixed seed bagel for breakfast. Nice small eatery with American deli decor. Small menu selection but sufficient for a good American deli sandwich. The bagel was really fresh and tasty while the pastrami was delicious and piled high. Would highly recommend if you feel like a deli sandwich or salad
2
The food overall is good, the experience is not. After waiting 45 minutes for a table you then have to decide and order your food from another queue at least another 15 minutes when there is enough waiting staff to take an order. Then once everything arrived we were in the middle of eating and they wanted to seat another person on our table to make up a 5 with the adjoining table. In order to do this they insisted I moved our bags from the spare chair. Much debate over the next 5 minutes over the fact that we did not want another person sitting with us and why were they interrupting our lunch to seat others. They stated they put us on a shared table, I told them they had not stated that in advance. I had to insist several times before they decided to move the other table rather than interrupt a family lunch. Do yourself a favour if you want to eat good food then order a take away from the counter and go sit in the park away from the the waiting staff who add no value to the overall experience

Went here for dinner on a friday night, everything was exceptional, food was great, service was excellent, the ladies were really nice and very accommodating, we even had refill of our pickles which was awesome. We told ourselves we will come back cause we just had an awesome dinner and experience and the bloody mary was spot on. Then we came back again for lunch thinking we can get the pickles but no we did not. There was no table service anymore, we had to go to the counter and pay first before we get the food. There was this guy who seem to be just walking around and could not be bothered to render any service to us. So it is a mix of good and bad. We would still come back and hopefully the management sees the potential of selling their pickles by jar. Incremental revenue. Just a suggestion
1
Food is decent - not amazing (the salads look really tired) but quite passable however the entire order-taking and general service is so poor as to spoil the experience and indeed, ensure we won't be returning.Welcome at the door was curt and unpleasant - instead of letting me talk and confirm I had a table booked the woman there decided to keep asking questions - overall not a good start.You sit at your table, are asked to remember the table number and given a menu then have to stand up again and go place your order. You need to stand up for anything additional (want a coffee? - go queue).Whilst this is mildly irritating it pales in comparison to the request for one (1) extra pickle. First waitress mentioned that this would incur an extra cost (fine) and promptly took a call and forgot all about it. A second one, flagged 5 minutes later, also stated this would have a cost (still fine) and came back with not 1 but 5 in a small pot. For this I then had to queue for 10 minutes upon leaving, to pay S$3... Simply ridiculous. Besides the fact that I didn't ask for 5 but just one, which in any other deli would have been graciously and immediately provided, the entire premise of having to queue for every additional request makes this cumbersome and not client-friendly. They seem to try very hard to make it as difficult as possible on their patrons.Message well received, we won't be coming back
4
The restaurant is not very big. Advise to make a reservation if your are going there, especially on weekend. The beef sandwich is very good, but is a little bit oily (so when until the end, the bread is a little bit soggy).
5
Very nice ambient , food are very tasty too, service are great. Will sure visit again. I brought family and friend and all had nice experience there.
2
We visited for brunch in the morning and order a main each and a dessert to share. My partner ordered a hibiscus iced tea and I ordered a Paris hot chocolate. My Paris hot chocolate was pretty enjoyable, and it came with a piece of unique mashmallow which I enjoyed. My partner's tea was a tad tasteless. Our mains was served pretty quick but however my latkes with pastrami was lukewarm and very hard to eat. My partner's scrambled eggs with smoked salmon was tasty however the bagel that was served with it lacked heating. We finished off with an apple strudel that was not crispy. Overall a pretty disappointing experience given the high cost.
4
Not exactly an authentic American style breakfast, but quite close. Bagels and beef pastrami are made in house. Portions are generous and the food in general was satisfying. Manager a bit presumptuous, rest of the staff kind and attentive. Like many other restaurant in Singapore it was way too cold inside, bring something to cover yourself.
3
Food is excellent, the only thing you must order here are the pastrami bagels. Everything else can be tossed up. But if you ever go there, be prepared to be dished a cold plate of attitude by the service manager. Apparently, Fareed, the service manager's prideful attitude has been putting people off since Nov' 15. I sincerely hope the business actually does something to improve the experience of their customers who are willing to part with good money to pay for expensive food.
3
The place offers an all day brunch and all day eggs menu. For those who used to frequent the Harry's bar at Raffles Place (the one next to the old Molly Roffey's), you'll see a familar waiting staff there. We ordered a smoke salmon bagel, a beef pastrami regular sandwich and the savoury Matzo Brei. In my humble opinion, the beef pastrami was probably the tastiest of the bunch. The other two dishes were quite bland (even with the addition of sauces). They were very generous with the beef pastrami and the brioche looked pretty decent. All in all, a decent place for a hangover morning or afternoon. Not recommended for a special night out/special occasion or a date.
4
I ordered the Grilled Reuben and my friends order the scrambled eggs with salmon and sweet matzo brei (basically a pancake omelette with all the sweet stuff).We didn't really like the matzo brei. Grilled reuben was not bad.Scrambled eggs were awesome! not too dry and cooked till perfection. Highly recommended!However, it would be good if they can take orders at our table, instead of having customers going over to the cashier to order. The space isn't very big there eh. And we need to remember our table number to order
2
Beef was relatively dry and the soup tasteless. The place was nice and good atmosphere,staff was pleasant
4
My partner woke me up and dragged me to town for brunch. The place was quaint, and very quiet on a weekday afternoon. How perfect! We ordered just 2 dishes but had all our cravings satisfied. 1. Eggs with toast bagel, scrambled with pastrami - Toasted bagel with cheese was sooo good. Very tasty and not too hard. scrambled eggs came with pastrami cooked together. i would actually prefer my eggs plain, with pastrami at the side so the taste doesn't mix. Didn't quite like the mixed taste, but i have to be honest, the pastrami tasted good, just that i prefer both separated. Perhaps i will ask the next time. 2. Half & half, corned beef sandwich large - corned beef was so so generous and it came up to almost a pile of reds. bread was toasted nicely and it was not hard, but crispy to the bite. Very tasty dish. One thing to note, the place doesn't serve coke. For coke lovers (like my partner) you will have to settle for juice or soda! We loved both dishes and would definitely be back to try the various salads i saw. Ambience was great, we were lucky it was quiet on a weekday
4
Menu with pictures will be good for first timer. We spent time imagining what our orders to turn out
1
I ordered the onion rosti with advocado. It was completely tasteless. Would definitely not recommend this place when there are so many other much better restaurants in Singapore
5
Excellent Jewish deli. Pastrami is second to none. The service was very good. And the ambiance matched perfectly
5
Excellent food.
Excellent service.
Value fot Money
Courteous Staffs
Like the ambience.
Attentive Staffs
5
We love the pastrami and chicken schnitzel!!! They do amazing Latkes. My Husband keeps asking to go back every chance we get.
4
A bit on the expensive side but food is good, place is not too noisy even if there are quite a number of guests
4
Made a reservation through "Chope" which worked like a charm. Nice ambience, friendly & professional service. Family shared the Speciality Platter (Roast Beef, Corned Beef & Pastrami), Eggs & Latkes amongst other things. Artisanal Beer was a treat too. Pricing reasonable and would certainly return
1
It's a wonderfully simple concept, and on the surface it looks great, unfortunately the staff are unable to deliver on the promise of the restaurant, and you should avoid at all costs. We chose the set menu, only four options to select from for each of the three courses. Regrettably we had to wait 20 minutes for drinks, and 80 minutes for main dishes. When the main dishes did arrive, two of them were incorrect, so we didn't eat together.When the two remaining dishes were eventually served we asked to discuss the issues we had experienced with the Manager. His response was to remove the dishes from the table, and tell us that we wouldn't be charged, meaning two members of our party of four didn't actually get to eat.They say a fish rots at the head, and it is definitely the case here. The attitude of the manager was deplorable, and the staff are completely disorganised accordingly
1
Having spent a great deal of time in New York, I was really excited to find a deli in Singapore. The excitement died with my first visit. The only thing they do well is bagels. The pastrami is dry and tasteless and the other items have been changed to suit local tastes so much that they don't taste like the real thing anymore.We ordered potato latkes and got a pile with apple sauce between each level like its fine dining. By the time we ate it they were soggy and ruined.Very expensive with a very limited menu. A small pastrami sandwich is $18 sgd????Not an experience I will be repeating
5
My wife and I absolutely loved our meal at Sacha & Sons, along with our previous meals there. It's the best Jewish deli food I've had in Southeast Asia, and I'd put it on par with delis in New York and Los Angeles. It's our no go-to restaurant
5
My second visit to this cafe. I love their bagels and their generous spread of cream cheese on it! Over ordered as usual and was stuffed! Food is fresh and portions are generous. The staff were prompt and friendly and kept refilling our water without us even having to raise our hands. Definitely coming back again and again
4
It was by coincidence I just had my lunch at wild honey and pass by this Sascha & Sons. Google this place and found out they serve food deli new york style. Once i saw the menu have matzo balls I booked the place for brunch for thursday.The ambience not like a deli more like a restorante but the food was great it fills my expectation for the proper bagel, matzo balls, pastrami and corned beef was good.And they do assist me to make the nicest banana chocolate milkshake. Love it.It is a good place to have a brunch, nice food, nice drink.Sure goint to go back there again for my matzo ball and the pastrami/corned beef, plus I am sure wont resist on a glass of sparkling wine.Cheers to Sascha and Son
4
New York kosher Jewish cuisine, interesting & not commonly available in Singapore. Tasty food, Good service & ambience.
5
Enjoyed the bagels, pastrami etc. Coffee was excellent too. Very good service. The food was well made and served as expected.
2
Great location and reputation. I had the Reuben and there was so little beef and so Salty! The rye bread was hard like a rock. Dill cucumber salad was refreshing though and best part of the meal. So expensive for such poor sandwiches.
4
The beef pastrami Sauerkraut sandwich was really good! As well I've good experience with take away -really lovely packed!
5
Will be back to try their Latkey and great Bagels! Love love love their warm and friendly service. Can't fault anything!
5
We were (non romantic) friends meeting up after a long time so we sat and talked for over two hours. The smiling and friendly staff made us feel welcome throughout our stay, unobtrusively topping up our water when necessary. The food was Super.
3
The food here is great, especially if you've lived in the states and are missing a good bagel or deli meal. At 16 dollars for a bagel with lox... its a splurge... but worth it every once in a while. The first time I came it was around 12:45, we waited for an hour and a half... even though we were told it would be 20-30 minutes. Luckily the restaurant next door was giving out free wine samples. They had empty tables, but were understaffed cleaning them. There were customers sitting at tables without any food or drinks, already having paid. I was surprised they let them sit around for more than a half hour. The second time with a reservation we walked right in but it was at 3:30 past the lunch rush. Definitely book ahead or try to come later than the lunch rush
3
Went for lunch and was glad we booked as it's a smallish place and was pretty busy. This is a New York-style Deli and serves up some interesting food. You order at the counter and from there on it's table service, which is prompt.I do miss a decent sandwich here in SG, so I went for the grilled Reuben on rye bread - corned beef with sauerkraut and swiss cheese. My lunch partner had the same but with pastrami.It was good quality bread and fairly generous with the beef but it was all placed in the middle, leaving the edges of the bread dry and unappealing. Cream cheese would have helped here but at $3 extra on top of $18, that's a bit rude.Overall, a pleasant place for a sandwich, though an exxy one. There are however, some other yum-sounding things on the menu and I might be tempted to go again
4
My previous experience at this establishment was an early arrival, 10 minutes before my reservation and was made to wait till my reservation time even though the table I was placed at was unoccupied during my wait. This visit, I arrived on time, table was still not ready for a further 10 minutes.Food was very good, in keeping with expectations. Food portions are also substantial, even if a little on the high side in terms of price.Atmosphere in Sacha & Sons is great. Small and big groups, communal tables and constant chatter gives this establishment a special vibe. Serving staff are attentive, though staff at the door can sometimes be curt
4
Having seen reviews of Sacha & Sons, wanted to go visit, and it was highly convenient as it was right in the middle of Orchard road. Has been said to offer a taste of New York, but as it has been over 20 years since I had been to New York, it would be hard for me to say.It wasn't too busy when I arrived just before 1pm, and was shown to a table. The table looked to be put together for a bigger group, but they were small tables put together.I was placed right in the middle. Was given a menu, but was not told that you had to order at the counter. I had the corned beef sandwich, which was quite big and more than enough for a lunch. The corned beef was very nice in flavour and texture. Good flavour and and not too salty. Overall, its a nice place to grab a quick lunch. A bit more upmarket that Subway, so its not something that I could afford everyday
4
Had seen photos of others food here so decided to give it a try. Really enjoyable beef pastrami Reuben sandwich or bagel, made with quality ingredients. You pay for this but as long as it's good, it's ok :)
5
It was awesome...i love the food and atmosphere..the staff are friendly and service was great..abit pricy... but food is definitely great!
4
2nd time back and Latkes still as good.. strongly recommend the one with smoked salmon. The salmon egg and bagel was also great!
4
Really good food and decor. Feels like an authentic NY deli place. Pastrami and Reuben sandwich are excellent, as is the beetroot soup. Leave room for the sour cherry strudel.
4
Small comfortable bistro/cafe, Authentic NY deli = pastrami & rye - fabulous menu choices. Didnt like the self odering process but they accommodated my request and took table order!
4
Main meal was excellent, loved the matzoh ball soup! The Kugelhopf was not as good as I had hoped, but it was the first time I had tried it so perhaps I don't like Kugelhopf in general.
5
A NY deli in the heart of the huslte and bustle of Orchard Road. .I happend up this spot by accident after a dismal meal at a local eatery . What a treat . The bagels are deliciious and the hand carved Pastrami reminded me of Montreal / New York authenticiy.I highly recomed , in fact every time i go to Orchard I make a point of stopping by for a take-awa
4
This is really a great place for everyone who is craving a great New York style bagel or Pastrami Sandwich. The service is great and friendly, even though I'm not quite sure why they have so much staff when you have to order yourself at the counter. The food quality was excellent and the bagels and egg dishes are top notch. The atmosphere is cozy with great music and a bit of a view on busy Orchard Road. The coffee was equally great and my favorite highlight was the home-made Black Cherry Soda - so good. Definitely worth a visit
3
It was a nice cafe, but it was not cozy, I was sitting with a friend at a long table with the others. We had to go to the cashier to order our own food. The cashier did not smile at all and was not very helpful - so it was not an enjoyable experience for my Sunday brunch. It was quite noisy, not relaxing at all. You have to like bagel to be there - most of the food was served with bagel.I had a scramble egg with smoked salmon served with bagel. In general, it was ok, but nothing special.
4
If you want to eat here make a booking. We booked and arrived at 10am by 10.20 the place was full. Choose your items from the menu and pay at the counter. $16.00 for a bagel with salmon and cream cheese, expensive. Very tasty but huge. We ordered one each but you could have bought a plain bagel and shared the topping from the other one it was very generous. The latkes are yummy. Total cost $60.00, two salmon bagels, side of latkes, coffee and tea
5
Great food, service and ambiance. the highlight of this place is that they serve breakfast/brunch all day :-)
the staff is very friendly and supportive.
4
The staff were attentive and also patient. Since it was our first time there, we had a couple of questions and the wait staff took their time to explain things to us. Definitely worth a visit
5
Food tastes great. Consistency of food quality. Friendly staff. Great selection of drinks. Lovely ambience.
4
Considering it was Christmas Eve, I was pleasantly surprised that the atmosphere was not hurried and rushed. Spent a hassle-free 4.5 hrs with a good friend at the joint. Enjoyed the food, company and wholesome experience at Sachas and Sons.
5
Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Reserved a table via Chope.co for 2pm and S&S kept the table for me even though I arrived about 10 mins late. There is a 15 mins buffer time so I was thankful for that. Service staffs were friendly and went round to ensure ice water was topped up. Cafe atmosphere was great and we didn't have to wait long for our orders. S&S serve all day breakfast. Highly recommend the bagels! One of the freshest I've ate so far and the cream cheese was absolutely delicious. Definitely going back next month! :
5
After traveling thru Asia for many weeks, we New Yorkers had a serious craving for NY deli food and we found Sacha & Sons on Orchard Road ... and boy are we glad we came! The best food we've had in a very long time ... the atmosphere and ambiance are simply wonderful ... the staff are most warm and gracious, especially Rei with whom we had a delightful conversation ... the beetroot soup (borscht) is the best I EVER had ... the savoury matzoh brei was extraordinary ... the cel ray soda is delicious and comes with a fresh celery stick! The sour cherry strudel is beyond belief ... there are so many tempting things on the menu, we will definitely have to return return! What a great place
5
Missing your New York Deli? This place hits the spot. My personal favs are the amazing pastrami sandwiches, tasty bagels, and yummy latkes - this place does it all with excellence! I love the cute decor and friendly staff! The high quality of ingredients really shine out! Definitely worth a visit!
5
The pastrami Ruben is clean and spiced perfectly. Served warm and melts. I suggest you share plates with people because you want to try everything on the menu.Also, I suggest getting a reservation because the wait can be an hour or more sometimes... Dining area is small, but the service is superb. Servers are helpful and very attentive. Prices are a little on the high side (example: Pastrami Ruben is ~ SGD 20). Expect a lunch for 2 to be around $50-7
4
Decided to try this new york inspired deli. Considering we have been to new york before and have eaten at several rave delis there, Sacha and Sons were not too bad in terms of portion size and taste. Of course nothing beats Katz Deli in NYC but this is worth the visit
5
After a few days of Asian food, wanted something different and stumbled on Sacha & Sons while shopping fountain pens at Elephant and Coral. Excellent pastrami layered with latkes and hollandaise sauce. The latkes were good, the pastrami was outstanding. A nice combination. Lots of other things on the menu looked good; I'll come back on another trip to Singapore.Service was friendly, portions good sized.I got to talking with the guy sitting next to me at the bar/counter. Turned out he was the owner (named Guy, I think) taking his lunch break. Had a nice short talk about travel and the deli business in Singapore
5
Sacha and Sons is a must. If you enjoy an authentic Reuben sandwich, well this is the place to be. If you don't know what it is, then go and discover it. It is a must and certainly worthy of anyone's bucket list.
4
My 3rd time back with my parents and did not disappoint! Great food and looking forward to going back!
5
The staff were super friendly and attentive to our questions. Great food. Highly recommended! Will go again!
3
Service was good. Food wasnt spectacular. Seating was cram. Not exactly conducive to hangout. Unlikely to return as there are better options in town.
5
Second time going to Sasha & Sons and the place doesn't disapoint...Bagels, Latkes and smoked meats are simply the best when looking for that New York Deli feel. Definitely worth a try!
4
i've been to sacha & sons a couple of times in the last month and its quickly becoming one of my favourite brunch places in a city crammed with great options. i always get the corned beef- it comes with a fresh bagel and cream cheese on the side. the portion is a big size (at least by singapore standards) and i do have a bit of a tussle finishing it. but its delish and i love every mouthful. the coffee (i'm a flat white afficiando) is good- not the best but enough to wake you up of a saturday morning. i've tried the cheesecake- heavy, artery-clogging goodness. the place is typically crowded but i've never had to wait longer than 25mins to get a seat. and while it is a bit cramped, its so loud you can chatter away with no fear of anyone overhearing you. price- not too bad and i'd say better value for money than some of the other brunch places in town. i'd recommend it for a brunch with your partner, or a group of friends. it isn't date-friendly nor for taking families with very active youngster
3
It's noisy like a meat market, tables crammed together. The gap between our table and the one next to ours was a mere 5cm, impossible to have a conversation without being heard by the strangers sitting right next to us. With such little room to move around, it's stupid making diners place order at the counter instead of having our orders taken by a server.My husband had the reuben - the meat was good, the dressing almost non-existent, making the dry rye tough to chew and swallow. My latke was not too bad but nothing to shout about.Would we go there again? Unless we just happen to walk past it hungry and there's no queue, no
5
As a native New Yorker abroad I'm always a bit skeptical of self-described NYC-style delis but with Sacha & Sons it's the real deal. I'm a devotee of their bagel and smoked salmon, and my friends swear by their Rubens. (Only things missing from the menu are bialys!) With quick service and an often-packed hour this isn't a place for a long leisurely brunch, but will such good food would definitely not hold that against them.
4
latke was not bad, but too small a portion and not filling. pastrami went really well with it though. rye was a little too hard to chew for the classic deli ordered. roast beef that came along with it was tender and juicy with quality though. the voucher made it more worthwhile though quantity has room for improvement for latkes.service from younger waitresses were very enthusiastic, commendable. the rest of them were of pretty normal standards, a little below above average. rectangular seats were situated too close together though. thankfully it was a quiet night
5
My fiancée and I have just arrived in Singapore and stumbled upon this wonderful spot in the Mandarin Gallery. The bagels are out of this world and the coffee is superb. Everything is freshly prepared and I honestly have never had a bagel of such fine quality anywhere in the world.I had a regular Pastrami bagel (150g) and my fiancée had a smoked salmon bagel. The staff don't stint on quality and they pack them with filling. The price for what you receive is reasonable and the staff are very friendly. Definitely coming back again if my waistline will allow
5
The bagel was the best I've ever tasted, together with the herbed cream cheese, it was superb! The roasted almond latte was perfection, complemented the warm bagel and smooth scrambled eggs. Definitely worth a visit, and even more worthy to go back a second time!
5
Great food & great service with nice ambience. Heart it! Will surely come back for more. Recommended
3
So long as you haven't had an authentic NY pastrami on rye, the offering at S&S is passable. Coleslaw was tasteless and lazy.
4
Been back a couple of times. Service, bloody marys and food are all great.
Bagels and the pastrami knishes are a must try.
4
Expensive but very very tasty! Delicious authentic deli food; generally good service although I was disappointed last time that the server did not pack my pickle into the doggie bag for takeaway!
5
Went would a group of 4 and we all enjoyed every bite of our meals. The pastrami is especially delicious. Bagels big and tasty. We also shared the sour cherry dessert that was a good mix of sweet and tart. This is a perfect place if you want an authentic NYC deli experience. We will go back.
3
The service was quite attentive and positive. The decor was good. Overall, the premises were clean. Menu, extensive.I had a large corned beef sandwich and a portion of chopped liver. I stuck with water, though various Dr. Brown's facsimiles appeared on the menu.I thought the corned beef sandwich was a bit dry because the meat seemed a bit too lean. The corned beef's taste was also lacking, though not entirely absent. The chopped liver, on the other hand, was quite good.Coming from NY, I am comparing the fare to the Deli style I am used to in NY and other US cities. Like most Western and other ethnic niche cuisines offered in Asia, few locals have the benefit of real tested comparisons.Further, I extend the benefit of the doubt as essential and quality raw materials are not always available in Asia. I would certainly go back to try something else on the menu. Are there other deli options in Singapore? or Asia
5
Took my fiancé to Sacha & Sons because I read before going to Singapore that they had the best corned beef sandwiches. My fiancé never had corned beef before. the sandwiches come in 3 sizes. I ordered the medium see for me and my fiancé. Well it was just right for me but way too much for my fiancé. So if you have a hearty appetite the medium size is good. I finished my fiancés sandwich and mine. Great eats
4
I tried Sacha & Sons for the first time for lunch today. I had the classic deli roast beef sandwich with mustard on toasted rye. Other bread choices are bagel and brioche. I added swiss cheese to my sandwich and it was delicious! Comes with pickles and coleslaw. I wasn't too fond of the coleslaw which contained onion shreds. I had a black cherry handmade soda which was good and not too sweet. Looking forward to going back and trying other menu items like the milkshakes. Service was very attentive and friendly. My friend and I sat visiting for a while after we finished our meal and the waiter returned and refilled our waters many times
4
We ordered Sunday brunch rituals - scrambled eggs with either salmon or pastrami. They are amazing! Toasted bagels are crispy outside with loads of semames and soft chewy inside. Scrambles eggs are fluffy and tasty, maybe too tasty to the salty side with salmon contributing. Ruby grapefruit juice is natural without sugar added. Coffee is from Common Man Coffee, which is good craft ones. I hate the order-at-the counter part though! Why are we paying service charges???10%???!!! Only happens in Singapore.
3
Tried both pumpkin seed and sesame seed bagel. The latter was better but still not as good as those in the US.
2
The food is good but not the services. The staffs are not paying attentively to the customers' needs and having only little understanding of their products.
4
Interesting dishes such as latkas, tender tasty pastrami sandwiches and excellent efficient service!
5
We were seated promptly and food arrived very quickly! Impressive portions make for good value for money :) 100% will come back again!
5
We have been wanting someone to open up a New York-style deli for years, and finally someone has done it!. While they had to alter some things for the local taste buds - the food is very good, and reminded us of what ate growing up in New York. We wanted to try everything, so we ordered a platter of spreads and meats to share with bagels. Love their chicken liver, pastrami, and pickles. Will definitely go back again. Finally, Singapore has a good deli
4
I stopped here with half an hour to spare for lunch. Service was very quick. Sandwiches/portions are very large and it was all I could do to get through it. They have a limited range of beers but they are very good quality. I recommend the roast beef sandwiches, very filling. Nice ambience and probably not exactly like a New York Diner but close enough for me
4
I read from some block that this cafe is best for its bagel. So I ordered the scrambled egg with Pastrami and serve with Bagel. It costs me $18++ for the dish and great that it turns good. The bagel is good to go with the special cream cheese. Scrambled egg is great with beef. The only thing is there is no green for the serving. Best to have some green and everything taste so buttery and that made me almost cannot finish the meal. Environment is good, very classic. During weekend, it will not be a good place to have gathering as the dining time allow is only 1.5 hours due to the crowd. If you feel you want to sit longer, then you will notice he staff will come and politely "chase" you away but removing your plate one by one and keep coming and ask can I clean your table. So you know you have to leave

I had a craving for bagels and lox, what can I do, it in my DNA. Found this place online and was prepared for a Singapore version rather than a genuine NY experience. Dissapointingly, I wasn't dissapointed.The bagel was fresh and the filling of smoked salmon and cream cheese was generous. That was good, but the bagel was covered in a very dense mixture of black and white seseme seeds, too much. I always prefer an onion bagel, but the only other choice was pumpkin seed. Modern fusion.The ambience was Singapore cool rather than NY deli friendly but efficient, but at least they werent playing jazz!The service was very attentive, and they seat your first and bring you the food to the table so the attemp to emulate NY deli experience by ordering yourself at the counter is actually just annoying. I dont like leaving my bag unattended.And then we come to the price. Remembering that Jewish food is poor mans food (smoked salmon at the end of the 19th century in NY was considered the poor persons food) S$38 for a salmon bagel, orange juice and a cappucino (with and extra shot) is very expensive, by any standards, anywhere. Too expensive. As the saying goes, the price is what the market will bare, and for me (and everyone I know) this is too much.I won't be going back again, unless they drastically reduce prices. What a pity because the food is really OK is you need a Jewish food fix

If you are looking for a taste of the culinary delights of the Big Apple right herein Singapore don't go past Sacha and Sons. The Ruebens are a must as are the salmon bagels, they brought distinctive nostalgia for the local nosh from New York City. Soulful and delicious
5
A real piece of New York in Singapore. This deli served authentic food which was well made, tasted great, and was a welcome change from all the oriental fare we had been eating. The owner is lovely and takes an active part in the daily workings of the facility. You will not be disappointe
5
If you are planning to eat an original New York-style sandwich then Sacha & Sons is the place for you! Friendly staff, beautiful location and the food is just amazing! Highly recommended to everybody especially their faboulous Classic Deli Pastrami sandwich!
2
Poor service staff at the counter. He was slow and impatient because there was line forming . Food was not value for money
5
I have now been there 11 times and the service on addition to the quality of food is excellent. As usual I highly recommend Sacha & sons and would endorse with no hesitation.
5
Such a delish spot! Try the Grilled Reuben on Bagel - it's to die for... the matzo ball soup broth could use a little more flavor, but everything else I've tried was pretty good.
3
Only the bagel was good, the rest of the food was not the best.
I had the hash corned beef, but it wasn't very tasty. Tried the 'pancake' but it also tasted weird.
5
Great food and good sized portions. Would split a sandwich and try the latkes if two of you. Plenty of choice
3
Food was decent. Loved the latkes and pastrami, but slightly on the small side.However, our biggest "beef" was with the restaurant's expectation that dinners remember the three digit alpha-numerical table number, and then go to the counter to order and make payment. Granted, our water was constantly topped up, and food was brought to us, but it still didn't warrant a full 10% service charge
3
A bustling breakfast place. Tables for 2 are situated very near to each other. May only be ideal for couples and close friends. Attentive service - refill ice water very quickly. Ask for recommendations if not too sure about the menu. Highly recommend the latkes and bagel. 
4
It was a long walk to get to the cafe and it was way at the back of mandarin gallery but when you get there, you'd feel it was well worth the trouble. I had brunch with friends and had the meat platter, bagels and pastrami. Bagels were warm and moist yet had a crunch that gives it a pleasant surprise. The pastrami was to die for and that is all i have to say about that. You may have the egg salad bagel to go with it but it was good on its own. Overall, a great way to have a good brunch near the happening Orchard roa
4
This place is ideal for everyone. If you consider yourself a meat lover then go for it. The dinner we had there was very minimal, we both had sandwich, a glass of soda for my husband and a latte for me. We spent about 60sgd. For the tasty food we had plus a very friendly service, i'd say the money we spent is worth it. As for the location, it's at the 3rd floor of Mandarin Gallery. You may want to make a reservation before heading there coz the place have limited seats. Aside from the small seatings available (which is not necessary bad), there's nothing not to like about the place. It's really ideal for anyone who wants to have a good meal, great service, decently price food & homey ambiance any time of the day. Worth a try
3
The food was average, the scramble eggs were good but nothing special. Was really hoping for a good deli type of food, but I was rather disappointed. It lacked the real aunthenticity of deli food.
3
I had the cured salmon latke which was very overpowering in taste but underwhelming in delivery. The coffees here are $8.50 the most expensive in Singapore.
5
This is by far the best deli I have been to in Singnapore. They make their own pastrami, bagels and much more. I ordered the Reuben sandwich with pastrami and it was incredible!
3
Food : not bad. Only pastrami was gd. Everything else= Blah. Chicken noodle, eggs = Blah. salad = no big dealValue: kinda expensive for that kind of food. but what is not expensive in Singapore anymoreService: decent but a bit snobbish. atmosphere: cool. pleasantWould I go back? Only if I am in the area and I desperately need to eat pastrami.
3
Start spreading the news, Sacha and Sons is bringing a little bit of NYC to Singapore. Located in the upmarket Orchard Ave Mandarin Gallery shopping centre, Sacha and sons certainly makes you feel like you are back in a downtown Deli.,offering Bagels, pastrami, Laatke potato fritters, Reuben sandwiches, rye and matzo bread, gravlax and goodies like smoked trout salad and chopped liver ....good coffee by Asian standards, freshly squeezed orange juice...certainly a great breakfast choice if you ever get tired of chicken rice from a Hawker's stall! Servings are very large so order less than more. After 5 coffees, 2 OJs, 4 mains, bill came to SiNG $150. Expensive breakfast by Singapore standards but worth it for something very different in this part of the world or if you're homesick for New York
5
Sacha and Sons, where have you been?! This city has been crying out for an authentic NY deli experience, and this place hits the bullseye. It’s almost a shame the restaurant is so hidden away, but the signage on Orchard Road escalators definitely helped us find it. The great thing about it being a little obscure is that it was super-quiet when we visited for dinner on a Saturday night. Our family of five ordered almost everything off the perfectly-formed menu, and everything was so divine, there was not a crumb leftover. We each had our favourite item, and mine was definitely the bagel with smoked salmon. Mt wife loved the beetroot soup, and said she’d never tasted anything quite like it. I’ll be back
5
The ownership of Wild Honey have done it again, this time with an authentic NY style deli. Amazing sandwiches, bagels, spreads & more! Recommend the pastrami or schnizel sandwich, and bagel with herb cream cheese. Nice selection of drinks as well, including in-housemade sodas and hand-selected wines. And service was great
5
I wasn't sure what to expect as an American who grew up on great bagels, but Sacha & Sons surpassed my expectations. The bagel and lox I had was very good. The pastrami sandwich my husband had was the real standout. We went early on weekday morning, but I'm sure this place is much busier on the weekend. If you are in the area and craving some NY deli food, this might be a good fix
4
Very nice deli experience and as a New Yorker, one that was close to the real thing. I had the Trout Salad bagel sandwich which was great quality. My only issue was the bagels themselves, although good and freshly made, still came up a bit short to the real New York bagel and also there were not enough types of bagels, in particular even the option of just a plain bagel would be nice. I also had a side of the egg and onion salad which was excellent.The wait staff is quite good and decently attentive. The setting is also comfortable although a bit small so perhaps good to book ahead, even for lunch during the week, if you which to secure a table and not eat at the counter
3
Overall it was ok. Ordered the pastrami but the meat was dry, the scrambled eggs were good with hash. Chocolate shake was a life saver but the cheese cake came out unthawed properly and still tasted a bit thaw-ed. Wish they had focused on that. The sides were great. Overall decent food but could have been better on the above mentioned.
5
It never fails to put a smile on my face and a rub on my satisfied tummy after a meal at Sacha. Good to go before 11am if there's no reservation and it's quiet and peaceful.
4
We always love Stephanie (the host) because of her kindness and warm greetings. This Saturday we came later at almost noon and there were just too many families with uncontrollable children. We couldn't her ourselves. However, food is always great and service never disappointed us.
4
make sure to try the bagels!!! They were fresh and toasty. Portions are huge so take that into consideration when ordering :)
5
We had the best pastrami sandwich here. The owner was so lovely and engaging with all of her customers. She recommended a dessert and it was to die for!!!! Will go back!
5
Sacha & Sons has become a favourite of mine since I discovered it a while back. It's a great place for a hit of comfort food; bagels, deli sandwiches and old fashioned American drinks. You can read more here http://www.singaporefoodie.com/sacha-sons-a-new-york-deli/
5
I was in New York last Year, but I have not eaten a Pastrami Sandwich as good as the one here. Great meat Quality and even better Rub on it. Its pricy (20 S$ for the Reuben) but for me, its worth the Price. Nice Location in New York Style is also Great. I wish we had something like that in German
5
Shockingly good. For years, I have been craving a genuine NY deli experience in Asia - preferably with authentic, fully-packed pastrami sandwiches.Sacha's felt eerily real - like I was actually in NYC. The pastrami sandwich was on a totally different level than any sandwich you would find elsewhere. The matzo ball soup was homey.I highly recommend this restaurant, as Asia needs to wake up to what a really great deli should be. This is it
5
Singapore is well known for its culinary delights. But if you want a change from the typical tastes offered by the city, Sacha & Sons is the place to go. Situated centrally in the Mandarin Gallery at 333 Orchid Street, this eatery provides a New York Deli experience as good as Manhattan can offer. The maîtresse de maison makes patrons feel very much at ease with her personal greeting. Serving staff are personable and efficient. Recommend making a reservation for weekend lunch; it can be very busy. A sure sign of “good things” on offer
5
Went to Sacha and Sons for a business lunch recently. This being the first time either of us had been there, we all ordered the pastrimi ruben. This did not dissappoint. By a long way, the best ruben i have had in years - even better than some i have had in NYC. The meat was reasonably lean, and some of the tastiest and smokiest pastrimi i have had. I want more!! Even before we had finished our lunch, the folks at my table had all said they can't wait to go back and bring friends and family
4
Excellent pastrami for a great grilled reuben, plus all of the sides you'd expect -- bagels, coleslaw, salads, borscht. Slightly on the expensive side for a mid-range restaurant, but that's to be expected in Mandarin Orchard. All in all excellent food for an atmosphere that at least briefly feels like New York
5
Pastrami on Rye - great meal all around with hearty portions. I liked the atmosphere too and can't wait to try the other dishes. Will definitely be back!
5
Didn't know where to go and stumbled upon this little diner with every bit the taste of new york. The corned beef and pastrami was superb. Though carbs servings was small. Choose the meat platter. Very value for 2 persons or even adding a 3rd
5
Reuben sandwich and latkes are really authentic and good! Tasty, juicy corn beef and roasted bread. I bought bagels to take away and they look good. But they only have sesame ones not poppy seeds ones because it's Singapore.
3
This cosy deli has a nice vibe, serves good bagels, sandwiches and salad at reasonable prices. Specialties are the pastrami and corn beef, but I found my smoked trout bagel rather satisfying. A pleasant change from the many mainstream cafes
4
This is probably the most expensive New York deli you'll ever go to but if you are missing good pastrami in Singapore it's worth it. The latkes were also very good and served with a generous portion of laches. The only disappointment was the rugelach, a bit dry and tasteless
5
We ordered the grilled reuben with corned beef, pastrami latke (potato pancakes) and matzo ball soup. They were good. We especially enjoyed the latkes. The coffee and ice cream sundae were good as well, just that the chocolate brownie pieces in the sundae were a little dry. Service was very good and we enjoyed the fact that it was quite quiet on that Sunday night
5
We visited as a family of five. Having seen American style diner food only in the movies we were eager to try. The food was awesome, large portions and very quick. Pastrami on rye was my choice for best meal but everyone was happy with all choices. We had a short wait for lunch but no real problems, service was excellent and the manager and his wife were present at all times. A great meal and we will definitely be going back
3
I'm not a fan of the confused decor (more 1920s NY than Manhattan deli), or the order-at-counter concept (some hodgepodge reworking of the heritage site Katz's?). But where else can one get good pastrami, corned beef, and bagels in Singapore?My favorite dish is the corned beef hash and potatoes topped with fried egg. That's the best treatment of that dish I've ever had, including NYC. I'm also very partial to their Reubens and smoked salmon bagels with herbed cream cheese. The portions are quite large and I have not had room to try the tempting desserts in my visits - also didn't want to go back to register again!Not a big fan of the soups, home-cured gravlax, and smoked trout dip. The cole slaw and pickles that come with the platters are authentic, but I don't like them in NYC Delis either
3
Unfortunately after 25 of waiting I manage to have a sit after order in the counter, the place is small and the prices for a deli are a bit step.At the end a good sandwich got to said lots of flavor and good bread.The only way I will be back is for take out.Happy meals!!!
4
Compared to other brunch specialists in town, I thought Sacha & Sons was very affordable for the quality. The meats were delicious, the bagels perfect and the cream cheese amazing. We went on a very uncrowded morning so the service was great. I would definitely come back just for the bagels and that heavenly cuppacino. I ordered the pastrami and corned beef hash, and it was delicious although I was so please with my bagel I could not finish the hash too. #goodproblem
5
This was my second visit in two weeks. The concept is totally unique, which is hard to find in Singapore. Incredible food, lovely atmosphere and great service! We'll be back!
5
We had a classic Reuben sandwich and roast beef with the dill pickles and cole slaw. Beautifully cured meats -- and very generous in portions. We will be back!
3
Nice ambiance for being inside a mall. Staff was nice. Ordering at register
Is odd considering it is more a restaurant then deli. Roast beef was tasty but dry. No need to go back:(
5
Looking for a good Bronx type of food after shopping in Orchard Road, here at Mandarin Gallery ease your craving with a grilled Reuben pastrami sandwich and chopped liver salad. Wash it down with a cuppa or Italian soda. Yummy!? What are you waiting for?
5
I enjoy a good deli sandwich, but after living in Singapore for 12 years, I was skeptical when my wife suggested going here for lunch as it's never quite like the real thing from back home. I was pleasantly surprised.
5
I'm so glad to have made reservations because the queue at this place can be quite long. For a newbie, you can order the platters to share with friends. We got a mixed platter where we chose the in-house made pastrami, corned beef, smoked trout dip. It came with yummy pickles, coleslaw, tomatoes, mustard and 2 bagels. They said this was good for 2 but I think it can easily be for 4 - just order extra bagels. Kids will not like the pastrami as its too peppery for them, but they'll take the corned beef, coleslaw and smoked trout dip. We also had scrambled eggs with fish (can't remember which fish) which also had some yummy cream cheese and, of course, another bagel! For drinks, our little one had fresh orange juice while the adults took on the indulgent Paris Hot Chocolate. We loved it
5
I can't believe I just discovered this gem. This is the only reason I found a purpose to set foot inside the Mandarin Gallery. Food was top notch and I truly felt the NYC vibes from just entering this joint. My kid devoured the bagels and we equally enjoyed our Salmon bagels, Chopped liver, and of course the Reuben Sandwich. The staff saw to it our water was always topped off and table is cleared the second they notice we have finished our meal—a rare touch in Asia, so it was well appreciated. So sick and tired of patronizing a place where staff doesn't care if our dished are lying around for the past 15 minutes without clearing the table. I liked how the owner/manager really seemed to care about his guests experience and it was apparent that he made sure his ship was running smoothly and all hands on deck—it was! I'm coming back, and bringing all my friends
3
I really liked the menu and the food was lovely. The food came quickly and staff were friendly. The only thing that slightly dampened the whole experience was being asked to leave for the next reservation when we had only been there about an hour and were still finishing up our drinks. Shame to let yourself down like this Sasha & Sons
5
I'be been searching for different places to take my husband for brunch and came across Sacha & Son's online and came with good feedback.It didn't disappoint... The service was first class, very attentive and accommodating which is great to see. We arrived early (Saturday morning) and the place filled up very quickly, would recommend booking in advance to avoid dissapointment. The food was delicious, we opted for the toasted sandwiches which were very decent sizes and yummy. Being pregnant and a picky eater I opted for the chicken schnitzel sandwich and I'm already drooling for the day I can have the pastrami sandwich as this looked (and tasted according to my husband) amazing. I will be ordering take-out from the maternity ward ! Great food, great service and would highly reccommend
4
It does not look, smell, or feel like a NY Deli, but the food is almost as good! The chopped liver is not as unctuous, but the pastrami, corned beef and toasted bagels are scrumptious. Short menu, but hey, it's a small place. In fact, Sacha's ceiling is too low for Sacha Baron Cohen
4
definitely the best pastrami in town, combine that we freshly baked bagels and aromatic espresso... a delicatessen not to be missed.
4
The food was great, just as good as a New York deli. It's a pit pricey so I wasn't thrilled about standing in line to order, but otherwise a good experience.
4
You must try the pastrami and the roast beef! The corned beef and meatloaf are worth a try too. The first time we ate here (several months ago), the bagels were quite tough, but this time they were just nice. I also liked the latkes.
4
I've never lived in NYC, so as I often say, I won't comment on the authenticity, but this is a great place for lunch. Hands down the best pastrami I've ever had and I did grow up in the States so have eaten a lot of it in my time. The chicken soup with matzo balls was nice and comforting. The coffee was really good too, one of the better coffees I've had in Singapore, flavourful and smooth. Definitely worth popping in if you're on Orchard Road and needing sustenance. Plus I liked that the owner was meeting and greeting at the door. She showed genuine interest in all the customers. I'll be back
4
We tried to get into this restaurant for a Sunday brunch a couple of weeks before but completely full and people waiting - so we thought it must be good and vowed to come back. We came for a late lunch before a trip and were not disappointed food wise. Great sandwiches on bagels or rye etc, with fantastic fillings of beef or pastrami, with gherkins and every accompaniment - you really could be in NYC etc. Waitresses were happy and seemed efficient. Nice jazz style background music was absolutely fine as was quite quiet at the time we went. My friend had a glass of prosecco and I had a fresh juice - again pretty good. As recent reviews have noted - it is pretty expensive though for what were sandwiches (albeit large and very tasty). So, not somewhere I'd go every week, but I'd happily go back another time to try again
4
The food experience at Sacha & Sons was definitely great. Especially when the bagels were so fresh and soft. The dips were wonderful too.But I thought there were some shortcomings that could be better. We called the fish platter with a smoked trout dip, egg & onion dip and smoked salmon. Oh yes, and a coleslaw. The "greens" that they gave was just onions, tomatoes and cucumber pickles. For two people who do not eat raw onions, tomatoes and cucumber pickles, I thought that a 55 SGD platter was almost half wasted. Also, we were made to order and pay at the counter. Other than them serving us the food, I do not think we should be paying the relatively high service charges (as the 10% is charged on the already-expensive meal)
4
I had my brunch at Sacha & Sons in Mandarin Gallery mall on orchard road today, because i really wanted to have and craved kosher/new york style food and my choice was %100 successful. I had an extra large reuben sandwich that was served with two pickles cucumbers and coleslaw salad. Guys if you dont mind paying 51 singaporean dollars for a reuben sandwich and an orange juice GO For It!! Its worth it!!!!
4
We tried it today since we are at Orchard area. Its located at Mandarin Gallery beside Wild Honey's. Lucky there's no queue when we got there coz usually there is. We ordered the Grilled rueben and the corned beef with egg. It was delicious and huge portions. Their hazelnut latte is also nice. And their customer service is great. Its always a plus point if one have a good customer service. The guy at the counter makes it a point to make you feel at home, and other service staff are also friendly and warm. A bit pricey but will definitely back if we are at the area.
5
Unfortunately it’s been awhile since I made it to NYC, and I was having a serious craving for NYC-style deli grub… Had heard about the super-tempting American style treats this place was serving up, so decided to go check it out. Located in Orchard, this family-run restaurant offers you the best variety American favorites around, and is the perfect place for friendly hangouts and relaxed weekend brunches. We quickly became fan of the Bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon and the hearty & scrumptious Pastrami roll! With Ella Fitzgerald playing in the background, and classic interiors, the Big Apple atmosphere is complete
4
My first brush with NYC deli-style Jewish nosh was a pleasant one. A sister establishment of Wild Honey's, Sacha & Sons sports the same cosy ambience, but the similarities end there. Instead of the colourful and homely lounge chairs found at the wildly popular brunch spot, Sacha & Sons is simply fitted with fuss-free mahogany furniture that serves its perfunctory purpose.Food-wise, I've summarised my comments on the items my dining partner and I had tried:1) Platter of House-made Smoked Trout Dip, Egg Mayo Dip, and Chopped Liver - this was offered complimentary in bite sized pieces. Had to restrain my dining partner from overordering; she loved the chopped liver so much that she was tempted to order a full serving on its own. 2) Reuben Sandwich - This was bulging with a heap of pastrami layered with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing. While the pastrami was well-smoked, I felt that the combination could be more moist. Perhaps more sauerkraut and cheese; the dry rye bread was a bit of a let-down for me. This is entirely a personal opinion; I was spoilt silly by the moist & fluffy Asahi beer bread used in Nassim Hill's version. 3) Salmon Latkes - Now we're talking. The traditional Jewish latkes were essentially crispy potato & onion pancakes, quite similar to Swiss rosti but much tastier IMO. Served with gravlax and sour cream, this was perfectly well-balanced in flavours and makes the perfect comfort food. 4) Blintzes - Another Jewish staple, these thin cinnamon-dusted pancakes were wrapped into a parcel stuffed with quark cheese, and paired beautifully with sour cream and berries compote.Last but not least, the hospitality is impeccable. The petite-sized server who attended to us was warm and friendly, and well-versed with the menu (the mark of a good F&B service staff). We felt right at home with Guy, the co-owner of both establishments. He was oozing with passion for Jewish food and F&B in general when he shared with us how Sacha & Sons was conceived (he'd spent 7 years in NYC).Though there were hits and misses in the dishes we tried, my experience here was no less than memorable. I can't wait to go back for their bagels and lox
5
Best Reuben sandwiches in singapore by far. Great bagels as well. All around a good meal and reasonable value.
4
As usual the food was delicious. We had scrambled eggs with sturgeon, scrambled eggs with salmon. All come with a delicious bagel. We also ordered a plate of Beef Pastrami which is a must try at this place!
2
I was craving for fresh bagels like in the US and ...... was disappointed. Doesn't taste that fresh and good (for the classic Bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese), so definitely not worth the price.I tried the Matzo Brie too (sort of pancake), and wasn't stunned either.Nevertheless, the pastrami is worth trying.Next time, I will go to Wild Honey next door instead
1
After reading some positive reviews about this place, we went to check out their famous pastrami sandwiches for lunch. We ordered the classic deli pastrami, grilled reuben pastrami and matzo ball soup ($14 for a bowl of chicken broth with 2 meatballs and 2 slices of carrots swimming in it). The classic deli was a let down. The brioche bread was smeared with a think layer of mustard and pastrami was super dry. We couldn't even take another bite and had to give the whole sandwich up.The grilled reuben was slightly better as the bread was grilled with oil and the melted cheese gave some moisture to the super dry pastrami. The sandwiches came with a tiny bowl of tasteless coleslaw each and 2 large pieces of pickles, which was the saving grace. As for the matzo ball soup, please don't even bother trying. The chicken broth was bland and the two medium sized meatballs were just mushy. I'm not sure if it was supposed to taste like that but I really didn't think it was worth $14. We also ordered the mocha with honey and black cherry soda. Nothing really fantastic about them.Overall, we spent closed to $70 for two of us and ended up disappointed and unsatisfied.
5
If you love a good Reuben sandwich or you are a lover of traditional New York deli/continental food then you shouldnt think twice about visiting Sacha and Sons. I loved it so much I bought some pickles and sauerkraut to take home. Having grown up on lots of continental food, living in Singapore I never expected to find such food in my time here. The service was excellent and the staff were very happy to accomodate our requests
5
Ive lived in SG for 2 1/2 years, and I finally found Jewish food!!!!!!!! Now, being from New York, I have very high expectations for how this food should taste and be presented, and let me tell you, Sacha and Sons exceded all of them! The pastami?....mouthwatering. The bagel with lox?....heaven. The latkes?....melt in your mouth delicious. I personally prefer full service to ordering at the counter, but I know this is some sort of trend in SG. Oh well. I hope Sacha and Sons does really well, and can eventually afford to keep their prices at 'deli' pricing and not 'restaurant' pricing, because honestly, dining here reminds me of home and I would eat there every single day if I could
4
Sacha & Sons brings to Singapore its authentic recipes, tastes and textures, so eat your hearts out! They are well known for their corned beef, roast beef, smoked pastrami, soups, salads etc, and these items more or less fill up the rather limited menu.*Katherine had the Half and Half (SGD$16.00) for her dinner. It meant half-portioned soup OR salad with half-portioned sandwich, which was a good arrangement for people who would love to try more stuff. She chose the Roast Potato and Capers salad as well as the Pastrami Sandwich. The verdict on the roast potatoes was that they were delicious and well-flavored. The pastrami was succulent and riveting in the flavorful herbs and spices it was infused with.I tried the Latkes (SGD$16.00) with smoked salmon and creme fraiche. Latkes are actually potato and onion pancakes, and I was curious since I don't remember trying a savoury pancake before. It tasted like rosti with smoked salmon actually, all crispy and tasteful. I was rather pleased with my choice.There was also a side order of Chopped Liver (SGD$10.00) to satiate my curiosity as well. To my surprise it came with a slice of hard-boiled egg and caramelized onions as well. The chopped liver was tasted like pate, except it was not as fine in texture. The strong characteristic flavor of liver (a little bloody tasting?) was very pleasing to the tongue at first, but got a little heavy halfway through the meal.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/03/dinner-at-sacha-sons-delicatessen.htm

So Wild Honey has moved to bigger premises next door and in its place stands Sacha & Sons, a NY deli serving pastrami, bagels and all things New York (and Jewish). Looking at the prices and concept, I can't help but feel this place is probably run by the same people behind Wild Honey: big investment in decor, acceptable food but way overpriced. For example, bagels with cream cheese start at $8. As a comparison, I bought my bagel at Cold Storage for $1.60. Throw on some cream cheese and it probably costs $2 max. Here, it's 4 times as much. Singapore has recently been ranked (again) as the world' most expensive city. I can now see why
3
Rather overpriced for deli food - seriously. Food was quite good but just not quite in the typical Jewish deli food that many of us (from New York, Montreal, Toronto...) are used to. Bagels were the best ones I've in SE Asia (Thanks!). $55 for a 'fish platter' to share is a bit steep. However, the 'trout dip' and 'egg salad' were delicious, as was the slaw. Gravlax was another story - slimy salmon - inadequately chilled was unappealing on the platter and probably not healthy; was this salmon 'cured'? where was the 'dill'? it looked massacred rather than 'thinly sliced'... and where were the capers? cream cheese?DON'T: serve crÃ¨me fraiche with lox and bagel puhlease - always serve with fresh cream cheese and a generous serve at that, NOT wee dipping-sauce-dish serve (seriously?) that we were served (towards the end of our meal).DO: serve gravlax with dill and capers (or capers on the side) but don't charge extra for the capers; lemon wedges too please (NOT lemon slices).I believe Sacha & Sons needs time to iron out a few wrinkles but I will definitely be back to see if any improvements are made. TRAIN YOUR STAFF please. Make them into discerning service staff by equipping them with knowledgeable of your products; sit them down and let them try the food and serve them like Kings...so they are aware of how good service to future patrons
3
The location near MRT so short walking distance. The service not fantastic but still acceptable, just we have to go to counter to order our food and bill. They only give us the foods that we order but still have to pay 10% service charge. The food is quite normal but fresh. Two person with one main course and a drink each will easily cost you around 50.

Generous pickles and mustard spread, very well mixed dressing for the Grilled Corned Beef and nicely mixed of Salmon Salad.

Great experience! Food is reminiscent to Katz's Deli of NY, sans the sampling portion. However, I felt food portion was a little small for the price.

We had the Reuben and the Scrambled pastrimi with bagel. The order didn't take long to get to us. They do a great Mimosa for morning cheer. Yums

Had heard and read terrific reviews about this eatery so decided to give it a go and was not disappointed. I was wonderfully welcomed by great - yet not overwhelming - music, the delicious smell of food AND most of all by Stephanie and Guy (the owners) who made me feel at home straight away and gave me the run down of their delicious menu (Stephanie created and tasted each dish until perfect!!)..... I have to say, I was not disappointed one bit!!! Loved my Matzos soup, my bagel, my Apfel Strudel and more...... Stephanie and Guy have not just recreated a typical New York eatery where food is concerned but the decor is just as authentic and done with lots of taste and a huge amount of attention and love.... just like their food!You will definitely see me there again

Don't miss to try the best Pastrami in Singapore, I ordered Classic deli Pastrami with mustard, my kids had the scramble with Pastrami and my husband the grilled Reuben. Everything was delicious all was perfectly cooked and sized! Excellent service and something that is difficult to find in Singapore: free flow of good coffee. We will come back over and over again to try the rest of the menu!! the ambience makes you feel not being in Singapore.... Love it

Ordered Chicken Schnitzel which was tasteless and dried out and not to mention, oily on one side of the bread.The latkes was so burnt and when we asked the waiter if this should be the recipe, he says it's like this and worst of all there was a hair on the sour cream on top of the latkes. Was a terrible experience! Never thought it would be so since the sister restaurant Wild Honey is such a pleasure to go to

What the???Took a friend to try out the Reubens at Sacha and Sons. I love a Reuben and regularly make my own. This one wasn't bad - it just wasn't great. The let down was the Russian dressing - not enough bite to it. It tasted more like thousand island than Russian.The bill left a real bad taste - $20 for a bottle of beer!! $18 for a sandwich? Would have been better off at Lawry's next door

I'm a big fan of Reuben sandwiches, so when I read that the folks behind the wildly popular Wild Honey restaurants in Singapore had opened a New York Deli, I knew the quality would be up to a high standard. I've had a handful of things here: the bagels, matzo ball soup, Reuben sandwich, chopped liver, chopped egg/onion, etc. Considering we are 15,323 km from New York (true distance, thanks Google), you can't really do much better for authenticity and the quality is up to a high standard too. As someone who typically doesn't like Sauerkraut, the one here is actually pleasant for me. My girlfriend had the Reuben fully loaded while I left off the Sauerkraut on mine. By the end of the meal, I was stealing bites of her sandwich!If you've never been to a New York deli before, some of the menu items like latkes, blitzes, matzo ball soup, chopped liver are probably going to sound completely foreign to you. But it's worth giving everything a try once. I'm happy to report I had my first ever Matzo Ball soup here and it was pretty good! Atmosphere is nice and homey, and the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food. Service is also pretty good and attentive as well

My husband loves this place. He said it's the best Reuben sandwich he ever had in town. I couldn't tell if it's good or not, but at least, they did it properly. Meat tasted delicious, bread was warm and nicely toasted. Haven't got the chance to try the bagels and other stuff though.

The food is fantastic and great service, particularly from the owners, Steph and Guy who make it a point to interact with their diners. Their Rueben sandwich and homemade bagels are mind-blowing. They also serve Bloody Mary in a jug, a perfect hangover companion and you can even pick how spicy you want it!Do make a reservation through Chope before going down during weekends as it gets really busy. If you didn't manage to make any prior reservations, do wait patiently. It is definitely worth your time. :
