French food is delicious and French staff is super nice. Had the cheese and cold cut platters. A bit expensive but good quality. Decor is super nice and the street is really typical with all the pretty shop houses.
5
Wonderful experience with a very friendly atmosphere and great food. Highly recommend for a drink or a quick eat with friends. Very tasty food and a good menu with a few gluten-free options too. The service was impeccable.
5
Beef and tryffle, wow! tasty burger with freshness. I recommend this place so much. Nice people, big menu!

Great place with staff that speak and understand English 100%. Service minded and very helpful too. Food was great and drinks too. Not too long waiting time. Ambience is great. Clean WC. Will come again

I have returned this place numerous time for brunch, their services are good and all the people there are extremely friendly and helpful. This location used to be a traditional Chinese medical hall (something like Chinese GP back in the olden days), instead of renovating the whole place.. they reuse all the facilities and changed into such a cool dining place. Even for their tables and chairs are reuse furniture, exactly the same sort we use during school days.Free flow of water available, but self-service.Free wifi is available, please request the password from their awesome staffs
5
We stumbled on this cafe on the way home from a day in the city, we had our little dog with us, and they invited us in and made us feel very welcome.The service we received from Ann was awesome, very knowledgeable, polite and excellent service, she made our visit really very special.In fact the entire experience was awesome 
3
Overall this place feels trendy for the sake of being trendy, not a relaxed cafe environment. We went here on the first day of Chinese New Year as it was one of the only "cafes" open. We ordered two sandwiches and two alcoholic drinks. It was a bit pricey for what we got, comparing to American restaurants of this type. I would suggest staying away from the alcohol (we had the cider and sherbet and a strawberry daiquiri), as they don't make a very good tasting cocktail. Lots of water and ice as well as both drinks being very sour and unbalanced. The sandwiches were served in bowls, which is a bit silly to me, but food is food. The staff was friendly (if not overly so) and attentive.

When you're confident enough to name a cafe 'My Awesome Cafe', you need to justify the description in order to stave off customer backlash. This cafe comes to close to awesomeness in many ways and is a very good place to eat and hang out. I was there for breakfast, and my duck breast on toast with melted cheese and scrambled eggs was really tasty, different from any breakfast I had had before. (Duck? Great idea!) This was one of the 'light bites' on the menu, as I thought that the mains looked too expensive, and actually turned out to be great value and thoroughly filling. Though I have to say that the bread was a little tough as I presume it would not have been stale. Service is very friendly and it's a really cool cafe, nicely decorated, looking to have been converted from an old pharmacy. However, again only a small thing, but, despite the fact that it wasn't too busy that morning, service was surprisingly slow when wanting to order and waiting for change, as well as a request for a straw to drink my delicious fruit juice going unheeded. So, overall: awesome? Perhaps not very good for sure

Love the wibe and the service in this place. The mix of the culture and design, combined with the healthy yummy dishes is actually, an awesome cafe! The location is great, if you are tourist or living in Singapore. Its a good place to meet friends, lunch with business or colleagues. I have still to get there after working hours for a glass of wine, so thats on my todo list!The mixed salads are awesome large, and you can have it all on one place. Its really amazing presentation, and the service is fast and I have eaten the same dish several times that are actually the same experience every time. The only drawback in this place is that it might be crowded so you will have to book or wait for a table. Staff is really friendly and nice, so they will try their best! Enjoy

I visited twice for breakfast and once on a Friday evening during my stay in Singapore. This place is quirky, fun and fantastic. The staff are extremely friendly and pay close attention to customer service. There is a comprehensive menu with plenty of choice. The Breakfast sets offer good value for money and the food is tasty and freshly prepared. Food in the evening was equally good and we had a sharing platter with lots of different cheeses, pates etc As we were there for a celebration we pushed the boat out with the drinks and consequently had an awesome time. The staff are happy to talk you through the range of gins and flavoured vodkas they have on offer. The honey vodka comes highly recommended. Don't leave Singapore without giving this place a try
5
We had a lovely fresh healthy breakfast here before a full day of sightseeing. It was great. Such an awesome, unusual place! Shame we only got to visit once!
5
Requested a last-minute reservation for 10 odd pax on a Saturday evening and the staff made sure that it all went well. Great atmosphere and a wide selection to choose from. Highly recommended!
5
I recommend this place. The food is like the one you can eat in south of France. People are nice and friendly ❤️ and prices are reasonable.
5
Amazing service, awesome food, fun drinks... My Awesome Cafe is the best bar in the neighborhood. Staff at MAC are the best in Singapore. Happy, enthusiastic and fun -- they make the experience what it is.
1
Limited main course selection. Smoked salmon salad was ordinary. Chili Con Carne was bland. Lasagne was simply inedible. Diet coke served at room temperature. Most wine on list about $100 per bottle. All electricity was lost 3 times, each about 5 minutes. Hot and airless. Dingy, shabby decor, uncomfortable stool seats. Service ordinary to poor. There are many great cafes in Singapore but I though MAC was awful
4
... but not as good as people make it sound. Coffee is ok, but definitely not the best in town. Breakfast was fine but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere and decoration is very nice though, and the service super friendly (although a tad slow). It’s also less expensive than what TA suggests
5
Had breaky at My Awesome Cafe which was terrific, enjoyed the bacon platter (definitely need at least two people to share I barely ate half) and the delicious ginger tea with honey and brown sugar. Stand out for me however was the staff the customer service was exceptional, they created a warm and inviting environment which I didn’t want to leave
5
I rarely give places 5 stars unless the food is really amazing but this is one place where I was willing to accept really good food given that the vibe was great and the prices were very reasonable.I had the My Awesome Salad and it came with 4 different meats. I think they should dial down the meat selection and focus more on the salad (salad is in it's name after all). The salad was just mesculan leaves, half an avocado, and a quarter of a tomato. Compared to the salads that you get in Australia it left a lot to be desired but it was still tasty. Plus the coconut water in a bulb was awesome and the pineapple turnover cake (add a scoop of coconut icecream) was brilliant. I would definitely go back
5
I work locally in the area and visit My Awesome every week day for breakfast. The food is amazing, and the service is personable and great value for money. There is a huge selection of meals from the most nutritious breakfast to the dirtiest desserts. If your visiting Singapore or work in the area 100% check it out
5
It was raining and me and my friends were finding a place to chill, found this great little cafe with no sign tucked away at the street, and it was the only place open. The food options were a little pricey so we just ordered drinks. Anne recommended the watermelon banana smoothie which was lovely. I'd definitely make reservations for my friend's upcoming birthday party
5
absolutely amazing - great variety on the menu for both food and beverage. Slightly pricey but nevertheless awesome !
5
Best cafe in Singapore i had wonderful awesome experience ...Yummy food...Nice people's..Great atmosphere..
5
If you ever in Singapore you have to go there! Great people and service. You can feel the passion from the whole staff for that what they do! We enjoy a lot the breakfast!
5
Our visit to My Awesome Cafe was a true highlight of our trip to Singapore! We absolutely loved the cafe itself, were impressed with the breakfast we ordered (crusty French baguettes with ham, cheese, tomato & fresh salad greens - and great coffee), delighted by the vibe of the place and the creativity that has gone into its design - but above all, were blown away by the hospitality of each and every team member there including the 3 owners who made a point of moving around the cafe and connecting with the customers. A memorable visit that we can’t recommend highly enough. We will be telling EVERYONE about our wonderful experience. Awesome says it all!
5
Had my goodbye party here last Friday as I am moving from Singapore to London. I had around 50 to 60 people and they truly made sure we all had a good time. The drinks were flowing, service was impeccable and we spent a good 6.5h there. Thank you
5
Having arrived into Singapore late one night... we wandered out to find a beer. We stummbled accross M.A.C. and we are so glad we did. The staff were so friendly that we promised to come back the following night for food... and we did.The place is funky... playing great music and has a great decor. I love the up-cycling idea... The food is high quality, nutritious and healthy. The ingredients are clearly hunted out for being top-notch.We came away feeling very happy and would definitely recommen

Very limited options for breakfast. Ordered scrambled eggs with pita bread for $18 which looked like something that was cooked in a student dorm room. Menu mainly consisted of different variations of chocolate protein shakes. Waitress seemed to avoid eye contact, did not write down our order and ended up serving us the wrong drink. Would not recommend. Not sure what all the other reviews are raving about; maybe for the cute and oriental decorations but definitely do not go for the food. This cafe is the opposite of awesome
3
I had breakfast here with my family. I had vegetarian version, I didn't like it much. Rest had meat and they said it was ok. It was strange that they didn't have ANY kinds of fresh juices! I had pomegranate juice, that tasted bad and was very expensive.The interior is nice and it was kind of them to give toys to kids to play with
5
Chris is very friendly!! she initiative to take photo for us. Not just one TRUST ME is more than that. Feel like the trip is worthwhile of the photos she has taken. HAHAHAHHAHA. Food awesome - Spoilt for choice. Generous portion. We had the sandwiches. YUMYUMYUM, pick your choice and you wont go wrong.I will be back to explore the whole menu
5
Awesome as usual ! Great food and ambience. CNY deco is double awesome. I think it's No.1 cafe deco among the rest. Beside that 'sour plum mojito' is awesome!! My partner had 'dragon martini' is great as well. Never missed this place. Will be back
4
Breakfast witk kids in this restaurant was nice experience. Friendly staff and good food!
Water melon Smoothies are made from crushed fruits - awesome.
4
Great food to affordable prices in a cool atmosphere. Surrounded of beautiful shophouses but with a New York club feeling. Friendly staff.
5
Best BLT ever and a great pint of Hoegarden. Generous portions, tasty non-booze options, kooky design and friendly staff. It's a winner 🥇
5
loved the atmosphere and food but best thing about it was the service...special shout out to Anne... very thoughtful and friendly ... will come back soon !
5
Tasty food, great service, we will come again if we are in the area!!!
It was my partners birthday and they sang and gave us some free cake. Great service tasty food worth the walk to get there. 1km from China town
5
Brilliant cafe not far from Chinatown. Came here on a friend's recommendation and can highly recommend. Very extensive menu with plenty of healthy options and great coffee. Very friendly staff and a great vibe :)
5
great food, fresh and healthy. Nice atmosphere and staff, the is very interior is very stylish. My favourite place in Town!!
5
Friend recommended me here and I can't be more thankful. Great atmosphere with nice interior design. Was initially unsure of what to order but Anne came around promptly and gave nice recommendations. Her enthusiasm was contagious and enhanced the whole dining experience. Thank you Anne and the rest of the team, had a great time with my mates and will definitely come by again
4
large variety of food options and drink options was quite overwhelming but the food was great in spite of the very disappointing french kaya toast which was not kaya at all but some kind of thick brown spread that was way too sweet. portions are big and appreciate the ghost story from anne about the place since it used to be an old hospital. will be back
5
Visited here for brunch whilst in Singapore. Went for the trip 8 dollar breakfast which was really delicious, especially the cold duck breast and the toasted brioche options.Service was very good, with the staff taking time to engage with customers and giving advice to visitors on where to go whilst in Singapore.Quite pricy, but nice for a treat!
5
It really is an awesome place with delicious foods, awesome staffs and not to pricey foods. Everything is awesome.
4
Fresh salads, beer on a hot day, great friendly staff what more could you want. Stumbled across this place, happy we did. For som reason the site is not allowing me to select rating button but I score it excellent
4
very aptly named; awesome food, and even more awesome staff. ask for ann for lame jokes and great laughs, definitely the highlight of a great gastronomic experience!
5
I absolutely loved the food and service! Look for Anne, she was a delight, very kind and enthusiastic and made the whole experience more fun! We actually remembered her service till now! haha, and generally it was a really nice place to dine at.
5
Very good food, nice decoration and good atmosphere with a friendly staff.
You should definitely get the duck hamburger with its brioche bread ...
Enjoy !
5
Had a great time today, great service. They had toys to keep the kids entertained and the food was good. The Parma and smoke duck was really good and reasonably priced for such a place. Will definitely come back.
5
Went for drinks on date night and have been for breakfast! Friendly, attentive service (Frank, Sam, Jules), festive atmosphere, great drink/cocktail selection, awesome food too! (Jules photobomb!) Plan to return soon!
5
I walked past this place on my way to a yoga class and was intrigued and decided to check it out the following day with my hubby after work. Upon looking it up one here I was shocked to find it at number 8 of the top places to eat in Singapore! Despite this we had a warm welcome and were ushered in to a seat immediately. We had an incredible geese board to share with fresh baked bread. It was seriously delicious! Our server was really sweet and attentive every though the place was pretty busy. Everything came out one time.Ten out of ten for atmosphere, decor, food, drinks, service....just everything! Really love it and will definitely be back soon
5
Had breakfast at My Awesome Cafe and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The eggs, bread, meat and oatmeal were a wonderful combination. It’s a fusion of Asian, French and American. The service was very attentive but relaxed. Prices were fair for Singapore, about $18 per meal including your tea or coffee. If only I were staying longer...
5
Food is Awesome, atmosphere is Awesome, service is Awesome:-) Prices not so much but then it’s Singapore and if you go out for dinner and want to have a drink or two it’s not going to be cheap. I rather pay a few dollars more and enjoy a nice dinner in a nice atmosphere. The service was really fast and very friendly, ask for their recommendation on what to try from the menu (there’s a good variety from superhealthy to healthy dessert;-)). We were 3 and shared the Awesome ‘Burgers’, a salad and the CocoNana (which came by mistake but we only got charged for the ice cream with espresso we had ordered)...just as a tip, if you order an espresso with the CocoNana and mix those 2 it tasted amazing (might end up on the menu as well;-)! Thanks Awesome team
5
Only complaint is service is a little slow, but it would be almost impossible to have fast service with this volume of customers.
Informal seating, reasonable prices, healthy smoothies, pulled duck breast burgers, cheese, platters, nice drinks, nice general atmosphere.
3
Friendly service overall, love the gin, although I am not into greens but great food for anyone who is health-conscious. Nice Ambient.
5
Great drinks, friendly people. Have a good time talking to Satish and Sam. Truly awesome! Quite rare to find this level of service!
5
A very good place in overall, with nice atmospehre ang great stuff (Anne, thank you for a little chat and recommendations), and I was surprised by size of portions - really big ones, and yummy
4
-Service good
- breakfast good
-price is ok
-coffee good
- location ok
what else to say?
- the decoration or furniture doesn't really show something special, but does it have to?
5
Very good food and good staff whose name is Sam and Satish. Good advice from the staff. I like the environment as well.
5
We had a very good time, best services by the folks here, just wonderful. ...sure to visit again. ..
5
Visited this cafe in my way back to Sydney enjoy this place really great burgers and drinks best service.
5
My regular jetlag-breakfast place. Perfect bread, nice salads, and a relaxed but cool atmosphere. And the service is great!
3
My Awesome CafÃ© is a hip spot in China town and we selected it based on the TripAdvisor reviews. The service was good and our waiter was welcoming. My wife and I order burgers but unfortunately they lacked any real taste. One of the kids had Lasagne which was good and the other had a sandwich which was tasty but contained a lot of fatty bacon.
5
Ordered the green chicken curry and though would be the usual. Was not. Delicious . Can’t believe this is my first time eating here despite live 30m away. Big recco
5
Location is great and really convenient to get to when you're looking for awesome food and service. Look for Ann (she told me her name was spelled that way? Lol) and she'll take care of you good! She's absolute gold.
5
Nice place near china town? Nice persons (Sam) had a good time!
Great sandwiches good coffee a d ginger tea.
3
Look, it is a great cafe albeit expensive but I was hoping for something a little different. If you’re from Melbourne then you will definitely feel at home as it plucked straight out of Fitzroy - very hipster.
5
Love the Stella’s and ordered the cold cut and cheese platter as well as the sausage platter. Anne was great. I come back all the time.
5
Great bar and serves ice cold Stella. Loved the cold cuts sharing plate. Anne the waitress was very considerate and attentive. Can't wait to come back.
5
So a short time after we sat down the awesome waitress Anne came by and helped us order drinks and food. We were all very happy. The food was awesome and Anne too. We are gonna come back for breakfast for SURE!
5
didnt care much for the decor but guess i get the appeal. food was tasty bt nothing special. the real highlights were the cocktails: a flying frenchman and an awesome colada. both were delicious but the colada was a bigger hit. dont usually like creamy cocktails but this one surprised me.maybe try blending it with powder rather than choc chunks so its less bitty though. waitress - anne - who recommended it told me it was blended wth natural coconut ice cream, which explains a lot. my recommendation is come here for drink
5
A friend and I recently visited My Awesome Cafe after a long search in Singapore for the best Bloody Marys in town. A few of the places we had visited in our search, mostly via 'Top Ten' websites which listed all the venues to discover the choicest examples of a Bloody Mary, were a complete and utter let down. We had encountered many excuses from various propreitors that a Bloody Mary could not be made until after 6pm, some bartenders had never even heard of a Bloody Mary (wtf), one venue claimed they didn't have any juices (...after deciding then on a vodka martini we were told they didn't have any olives), and another place claimed they were too busy to make one....there were 6 people in the bar. Fortunately, we had frequented My Awesome Cafe for beer on many previous occasions so we decided to give it a chance, to which we were more than pleasantly surprised, if not downright beside ourselves with what showed up on our table. All the ingredients were fresh, colourful and bursting with flavor. The tomato juice was also fresh and refreshingly subtle, which is highly uncommon in a Bloody Mary these days, at least in our experience. So, our hat is off to Satish, bartender, for restoring our faith in the holiness that is one superb Bloody Mary! A big thank you also to Dee and Anne, who provided top notch customer care, service and attention
5
My favorite bar in Singapore. Mojitos are excellent, the food is fresh and well cooked.Personal recommendation is the duck platter.Great atmosphere. The staff is terrific, specially awesome Ann always smiling and to assist you with your order. This place would be different without her
5
really cool cafe tucked away in a not too busy street with great food and really nice staff. if you need any assistance, Ann is more than happy to help like she did with us! recommending great food and great service:)
5
Went to eat last night and was served by Anne and she went above and beyond to make my experience great !! Really couldn't have asked for more and the food was delicious too :-)) 5/5, would recommend to all my friends.
1
3 Service staff available but nobody came for ordering. Instead manager instructed the service boy to clean the floor.
5
Food is great, beers are floating and exceptional service from Ann. Ask her about the ring. The place is always packed.
5
Visited this quaint cafe recently while on holiday with friends. The staff was very friendly and helpful, recommending popular drinks and dishes to us. Anne, in particular, was very attentive and polite.
4
A great place to hang out in Singapore, have a cold beer, or even better a tasty cocktail (Sour plum mojito!!). Pair wit with their dips of hummus, pesto and red pepper, and you’re in for a treat! Noisy atmosphere, shared tables...great experience!
5
Amazing service and the best coffee we found in Singpore! A great menu with a huge variety. Very relaxed cafe with all the feels! Hope to visit again soon!
5
Ann, Azim, Jules and the rest of the team were amazing, we spent like hours at the cafe having some power drinks and great food. The guys also helped us in planning the next leg of our trip in South East Asia so we are most grateful! :
5
Really exceptional food. I had the Awesome Burger - duck confit with tomatoes and side salad - and it just melts in the mouth; so good!. The name was a bit of a misnomer; it's more like a giant sandwich, and a whole one is probably enough to share. All the ingredients were of top quality, and it's probably one of the tastiest sandwiches I've had in a long time. The restaurant itself is small and cosy, and has a very vibrant atmosphere. There were all kinds of folks there from parties, to families and couples; it was really nice. The staff were friendly and had a laugh with everyone. I'd highly recommend it if you're visiting downtown Singapore :
5
We literally stumbled across this lively bar in Telok Ayer Street, we only popped in for a cheeky late afternoon pint and ended up staying late into the evening.The service in second to none, attentive and super friendly, especially Anne, who never fails to put a smile on your face.Will I be going back? You bet I will..
5
Beautiful food and the best service Ive ever had. The team was SUPER helpful and kind. I’d love to visit here when I come back to Singapore again!
5
We had a company event with ~30 people. Jules and his crew did a wonderful job making sure the right amount of drinks and food was delivered throughout the night. Would have my event here again!
5
My Awesome Cafe is one of those places you can go for lunch, hang with friends, have a catch up or just chill. With a good selection of healthy food is the place to be. And the bonus is they are always open.
5
Cozy little cafe in Tanjong Pagar will a lot of simple food and beverage options caring for everyone. Great decoration and atmosphere. Jules the assistant manager is very friendly and helpful. Will be back !
5
Nice place, good ambience, great food & drink, helpful staff.. Special mention of Anne (with us in the pic) and Sam... Must visit in Singapore
4
I love going to My Awesome Cafe for lunch! I always order a fab salad bowl that is packed with avocado, seeds, dried cranberries, lettuce leaves, etc. It’s a very generous portion indeed. If you’re trying to ‘eat clean’ this is a great spot to get a good meal at.
3
Cool vibes and friendly prompt waitress and waiter. Looks like heaps of healthy interesting smoothies on the menu. However I had ham sandwich and was good but for the size you get the price was ridiculous. Could not believe I paid $21 (including service charge) for a small sandwich
4
Was there last night and it was quiet as is quite normal for a Monday night. Ordered their cheese sandwich with bacon bits (first time I had food there). Turned out to be a mini french loaf grilled crispy. Really tasty but a bit oily. Should have ordered the one without bacon! They have a wide selection of alcoholic drinks with many types of imported bottled beers. Definitely enough variety to satisfy all! Overall a nice place to hang out after work with colleagues and friends. Roadside parking available but normally difficult to get a lot on Fri & Sat. Staff really friendly and I also like the retro deco and ambiance especially the antiques and other retro stuff at the back and in the toilet
5
It is an amazing place with a great atmosphere to connect with friends and the vibe is strengthened by the work attitude of the waiters and waitresses. Waitress (anne wong) really left me a positive impression as she was incredibly approachable and showed great passion towards her job
5
My wife and I are on our first trip with our new born baby boy (4 month old). We were a little unsure if the baby and his stroller would be an issue since its such a busy place- but the owner took the stroller in himself and helped us find a nice little table. We forgot the name of the nice lady who served us but she was super duper nice. The coffee was great and the food was fresh, tasted great and the portions were generous. This should be a must visit for anyone that visits singapore. Thank you My Awesome Cafe for being Awesome ^^ we're going to visit again
5
It is a crazy decorated place, but i am loving it :-) Had very good (and cheap) breakfast there! Definetly worth going!
5
Came to this place based on friend's recommendation. Great food and beers! Good deal of happy hours! Staffs were friendly and knowledgeable! Awesome atmosphere and loud music! Thank you for leaving a memorable impression, My Awesome Cafe! I'll be back! :)
5
Being in a refurbished traditional medical clinic, it was the perfect place to experience Singapore's historical charms. The service was prompt and friendly, and in particular, one of severs, Anne, recommended so many signature mains and cocktails, making the whole time spent so easy going and pleasant. I highly recommend it
5
A friend introduced me to this nondescript tavern-like cafe and the experience here just blew me away; I just HAD to leave a review here. It's unlike any of those generic "hipster-cafes" serving the same food and ambience. Warm and welcoming, this cafe has a genuine touch made possible by the wholesome yet refined food that just tastes great- absolutely worth the price. However, it was the service that really made me fall in love with this place. Our bubbly waitress, Anne, was constantly aware of our needs, even before we realised them- offering to top up our bread basket and providing menu recommendations that melded well. I will definitely be back soon
5
it's hands down one of my favourite places to spend my friday nights. the staff are the friendliest people i've met. and from the times i've been there, i could tell that the staff puts in effort to make sure the customers feel welcomed, even during their busiest hours. (and a GIGANTIC shoutout to Anne for always making me feel so much at home every time i go over) its a good place to hang and catch up with your friends, regardless of the age groupespecially in the evening, the cafe is full of life and definitely worth giving 5 stars. i know i'll go back with my friends when i have my next break
5
A true gem in China Town, set in an old medical clinic, this awesome cafe lives up to its name in more ways than one. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere just as good and the staff are extremely friendly.We had breakfast at the cafe. I am sure the rest of the menu will be just as good as the breakfast.Opening up onto the street, itâ€™s also a great place for people watching
5
The first thing that strikes you about this place is how oddly cozy it is. The atmosphere was so chill and the interior beautifully decorated. I was also very pleased to see how many healthy food options there were. I had a go at the Awesome Salad and found it delicious and filling! The food was served to me surprisingly fast as well. I have to give props to the friendly staff too! My waitress Ann was very welcoming and made me feel right at home. 5/5 dining experience
5
was there to celebrate a friend's birthday and the service was good! bought a couple platters and the food was served hot (just like you Anne). totally no regrets going! gets quite warm, but nothing too uncomfortable. thanks MAC, we really really enjoyed celebrating at your place
2
Sat down and waited after a while we got menus and ordered drinks. The writer spent a long time praising the pomegranate and vodka. Shame he forgot to serve it. The Bloody Mary made with fresh tomatoes was great. Especially after I stirred itAfter another long wait our food arrived and I ordered a coffee. Which turned up after I'd finished the food. Then a wait to order the bill, then a reminder, another reminder and as we got ready to walk out the bill arrived.Would I go again. Not if I was hungry or thirsty.
5
Although the place isn't perfect, eg. could have had more options for large parties (long tables), was a little crowded and loud, it was definitely one of the better cafe/ bistro experiences I've had. The decor is a nice fusion of modern with traditional Singaporean experiences (going down to even getting the same tables actually used in most Singapore schools) with just the right amount of clutter to leave it homey but not stuffy/unsanitaryAnne, Dee and Chris were really good in making sure the food came in a timely fashion. At first, I was uncomfortable with the number of expats in the bar and how chatty everyone was, but with encouragement from the servers, my friends and I slowly started to ease into the atmosphere and enjoy the lighthearted party vibes. The food was GREAT although a little out of my range (I don't earn much so this was a treat). I was actually amazed at how BIG the menu was, as usually restaurants with this big a menu have problems maintaining the freshness of their food, but this cafe didnt! Overall had a fun time and would come back again definitely but maybe when I have a little more in my wallet ((PLEASE START GIVING DISCOUNTS HAHA)
5
Great food and weird deco making a perfect experience. Located in a really nice neighborhood, the food was really good too. Big recommend.
2
I'm quite surprised that this place is ranked so high. Sure, the food is good but the service is terrible. No a/c so it's very warm. A classical tourist trap.
5
Would highly recommend - people who run it are very warm and welcoming and the service was great. It is also in a great area and we would certainly visit again

I and my husband are in a clean place healthy food very happy because
because all the food is fresh 3 time i came to this place
during our stay in this country We are very happy
Thanks for very good food
3
Went there after reading all these wonderful reviews. Very very average. Nothing to write home about in the menu. Everything had a ton of green leaves added to it so the tastes were muddled. I don’t mind salads but this was honestly very boring for dinner. Maybe it’s a better breakfast place. The venue is interesting considering it’s an old clinic converted to a cafe but I have no idea why this is in Singapore’s top 10 considering all the amazing spots we have here.
4
As I was in search of a quaint restaurant that offers and is open to Gluten Free Options, I chanced on “The Awesome Cafe”, I gave it a shot and called to reserve a table for 2 and day in advance. Heartfelt thanks for taking the effort to listen and cater to my dietary restrictions request (Gluten Free, Dairy Free and nuts free) and made changes to certain items on the menu even when preparing my food to avoid allergen contamination. With this kind and dedicated sincerity and understanding of my situation, I had a lovely time with my hubby at the cafe and the food was lovely too. Much appreciation as it is extremely comforting to be able to dine out happily without worries and enjoy delicious food.
5
I went here as it was the top rated cafe in Singapore and I experienced why. The place was packed at lunch time but the staff was warm and accommodated me on one of their high tables.Order coffee and the Chili.. the coffee was excellent and the chilli was good but not as good as you get it in Texas. The ambiance was amazing though and the internet speeds were good... definitely a place to come back to on future visits!A special shoutout to the staff as they are attentive, informative and efficient

we ordered two salad. not alot of seasoning and does not come with extra dressing but it's good. very light lunch. bread was good. the location is very close to let, easy to find. one thing that I don't like is that the music is wayyy too load, and it's a open space no a.c.
4
Tried this cafe first time and was amazed at how they managed to refurbished it from an old clinic to a hip cafe. Staff were awesome too! Extremely friendly and ready to help with good recommendations. Managed to chat w Bong (think that his name) one of the co-owners and got to know more about the set up and idea behind it. Good to see the place still crowded after 3 years in business. Great place to relax n watch the world go by.

Just looked for a place in the neighborhood for brunch and chose My Awesome Cafe.What a divine surprise...!The place is absolutely fantastic - an old coffee shop, filled-up with amazing decoration, and colorful lanterns... just the place by itself deserves a stop.Staff is absolutely great, very friendly, always smiling...Food was really good - with special plates for breakfast that will definitely fill you up, and some energizing mocktails if you fancy this kind of drinks :)(I went for my usual flat white
5
Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Food is real and clearly made of superb ingredients.
Interesting decor in a great location in Telok Ayer close to town and MRT station.
5
We held the farewell party for 2 of of our friends, and it is really lovely and sweet. The services and atmosphere is definaltly good and awesome. The staffs is helpful and lovely.
5
Great fresh breakfast- fruit, fresh juice and coffee. Bacon and cheese bread also great and very friendly staff. Vegan and vegetarian options - would recommend.

My 3 nieces whom had their private birthday party at My Awesome Cafe feedback that they enjoyed themselves very much. Following week, a second celebration for a friend's birthday at the cafe again re-affirmed that this is the-Birthday-place!The owners and staffs were very accommodating in helping us with an in-prompt-to surprise for our birthday girl. They helped us hide the birthday cake which we got from Pantler next door. They also put fireworks lightning stick on the cake to spice up the occasion and sang birthday song together. Thanks Zeus, Ann & everyone!"My Awesome Duck Confit Burger" is a must try.This French Brioche is crispy on the outside & soft on the inside, stuffed with fresh semi-dried tomatoes and duck confit.Yum!Cheese-lovers, do go for their Cold Cut Cheese Platter.Above 2 dishes nicely fills 3 persons's stomach. Don't forget to check-out their cold Ginger, Raw Honey & Brown Sugar Tea and hot Cappuccino too
5
We came here after lunch as we fancied a little dessert, we were gutted that we had not come here for lunch as the sandwiches and salads looked incredible. We did however, had a caramel delight dessert with salted caramel icecream, it was sensational!!!!!!Great place, fab atmosphere, a must visit
4
Nice and relaxed place on Telok Ayer St with a limited but interesting menu concept and good quality ingredients. I had the ham and cheese sandwich, which was both tasty and filling. My colleague has a tasty looking salad (not sure which one) and there were several other items I would have like to have tried. Will go back in future and try some other stuff, plus there are drinks after work for decent prices - always a winner
5
Visiting Roland and his Team was so nice- we came twice and will come again! The breakfast is the best we had in Singapore- nice Pita, really nice porridge, nice salmon,... awesome coffee!The service is very kind and chef's tips for exploring Singapore besides the travel guide route were perfect for our stay.Danke Roland und bis bald
5
A wonderful place with excellent ambience, great service staff and food. It's our first visit and it has been a really lovely evening. The staff was really friendly and sweet. They recommended the awesome salad and awesome burger which was really AWESOME. Loved the burger, you should totally try it (: a place recommended
5
This place sells itself. Any passer-by will see it is packed and all the people inside are smiling and laughing with joy. So my review is mostly to personally thank the staff (and the owners) for making my night truly awesome. The word awesome is over used in life, and most of the things people describe as awesome are actually pretty lame, but the staff and the food at My Awesome Cafe are real deal awesome. The staff welcomed us as family. We didn't know them. We were strangers in a foreign land, and all of a sudden we were transported home with people who loved us and fed us a delicious feast. This treatment goes beyond customer service, this is the energy that comes from happy people and gets transferred and magnified as it is passed around. Its 3AM the same night and I am on my laptop typing this review because I am still on a high from all the fun we had. If you are the owners and you are reading this review, know that I bought the t-shirt from your legit awesome restaurant and I will rock your shirt all over the town and world
1
After waiting a lot time to make an order the weiter told us we looked unsure if we want to order. Not a problem! After having our food served, we figured that some parts were missing. We were ordered something "on the side" instead. All in all:The food is without any love and the coffee seems to be one of the trendy hippster coffees. The only problem is, there is nothing special about it.Prices are too high for what it is
5
This is definitely an awesome little cafe. I enjoyed taking a break from my sightseeing, sitting out the front overlooking the streetscape and enjoying a latte. I must get back for lunch sometime.
5
Really unique and memorable place. The food is really yummy! I will always remember it.
The use very unpretentious utensils that reminds me of my grandmother home, and allow us to focus on the food it self.
5
Want to enjoy a localised throwback restaurant with nostalgic designs? This is the place for you. With many healthy options and excellent staff, I highly recommend this as a pit stop away from the blazing sun in Singapore.
5
Amazing place with tasty, healthy food and powerful espresso. Great vibe and nice range of people. Dee (staff member) was very cool 🙌🏾
5
I've frequented this restaurant a number of times now and the food has always been consistently tasty and awesome. I would recommend the Duck ConfitI recently left a bag there also with a number of important documents and also my laptop inside. They kindly called me and held the bag for me for a number of hours until I was able to pick it up. Nothing went missing and they also wouldn't accept a tip.Awesome people and awesome food
2
Not sure what I was quite expecting but once you are seated you feel committed.I ordered the "Amazing Sandwich" expecting a sandwich and the pomegranate juice expecting not to close your eyes and try and decide whether or not it resembles pomegranate.My partner ordered the Seafood salad. When I asked how it was he replied "I'm not coming back here again, very average"Don't get me wrong, the menu is impressive reading but I'm not a health junky and I like a good ole hearty meal-especially when breakfast is the most important meal of the day
1
Asked the waiter what was the specialty in this cafe. He turned the menu and said, "These are the salads, these are the sandwiches.." I didn't get my answer. After ordering, I had to wait 20min for my salmon sandwich. It's dry and tasteless. As for my single scoop sobert, I waited for another 20min. I gave up, paid and that's the last time to this cafe.
5
I went to have lunch on National day and I was really craving for a French sandwich and some Muesli! I booked for the table outside which was super nice. I had a great time eating great food. The cherry on the cake was Franck who took the time to tell me the story of the my awesome cafe adventure! Last but not least the building itself is beautiful. I will be back for sure next time I am in Singapore
5
The décor of the café brings back some childhood memories, especially with the old school desks that they used for their tables. The quirky décor brings a smile to the face and it is always fun reminiscing about our younger days. It is a refreshing change from the many bars and cafes around the area.The service is great and all the staff are friendly and cheerful. They are forthcoming in giving their recommendations if you are not sure what to order. The food is delicious and the portions are generous.It gets crowded during lunch and in the evenings so it is always best to make a reservation especially if you have a big group. Definitely a café /bar that you must go at least once
5
A friend recommended several cafes and restaurants in this area for a late lunch, which were either closed or full. I then chanced upon this café, and it indeed lived up to its name. There was a constant happy and friendly vibe, as people came and went, and the staff clearly enjoyed working there. I ordered a salad with duck confit, glazed breast of duck and duck gizzards (yep, I like duck). It all went down a treat. I first washed it down with a special healthy green concoction with lots of ginger, and then moved on to a couple of Stella Artois beers. A memorable visit, the details of which I have in turn passed on to my friend. Strongly recommended for a pleasant casual experience
5
Good atmosphere, good food, good cocktails, very friendly and profesionnal staff : simply awesome :)
5
This restaurant has a gorgeous ambience with lovely lanterns hanging and cute decor. There is a nice selection of foods and gluten free options available. There are fresh juices and a range of alcoholic beverages. Nice vibe for a relaxed night out!
4
Huge delicious plates, but quite expensive. The interior is eclectic cosy and the crowd both business people in suits and locals.
5
Always Awesome to be at My Awesome Cafe, really. Great for couples, groups, friends, family with kids. Salads and platters are the best.
5
A perfect little spot for an in-expensive, healthy lunch. Even had our favorite acai bowls! Fun decor and on a lovely street just a few blocks from Lau Pa Hawker Center. Enjoyed the casual open air seating and friendly service. A few doors down is an unassuming foot reflexology lace that we ducked into an loved! Ancient Therapy, 184 Telok Ayer Street. So fun
3
This is just a café serving drinks and snaps. The reason it is popular with overseas visitors are the marketing effort involved. The café is not too popular with locals and Asean visitors; as there is nothing too exciting with neither the place nor the food and drinks. The café was previously a clinic; and this more likely the attraction for the overseas visitors. The location is good and near one of the good hawker centers. Visit it for the sake of "HAVE BEEN" 
4
Amazing place to grab a quick lunch in the CBD. Stepping in here takes you away from work life, the polishes surfaces in the CBD. The salads are generous, and the lasagna delicious and hearty. Highly recommend this location! It can get full, so do go a bit early
4
Service was good, food was delicious. I particularly like the school tables, pipes, high ceiling, metal plates, vintage fans. If you take your time to look around, there are alot of vintage knick knacks. Just take your time to enjoy all this in the converted free clinic.
1
We were in Singapur and tried to find this recommended restaurant. We tried and tried, walking street up street down. No way: the restaurant probably has changed the name.....
5
Stepping into My Awesome Cafe is like stepping into a Time Warp where you will travel back in time and enter a whole new world. The cafe is mainly Vintage Chinese Themed with amazing furniture and decorations that help boost the environment of the cafe. The experience is further enhanced by the friendliness of the staff as well as the quality of the food. The food was amazing as you experience the harmonious unity of subtle ingredients as well as the sincerity of the staff! Amazing place and I will definitely go back again
4
Really! It's awesome. The satff is very gentle, the atmposhere is incredible and original and the draft beers excellent.
Highly recommendable!
5
Awesome ! The team is very nice, duck confit burger full to share with friends, beautiful salad, and toys for kids
5
For a reasonable price you can eat a delicious breakfast with great music!
The menu has a lot of options even if you are vegetarian and the staff is very nice!

Went here on a Sunday morning with my husband and parents during our stay in Singapore. Had seen it on Trip Advisor so thought we would try it. The place itself has an industrial style set up with lanterns hung around. It was quite busy with reservations and walk in diners like ourselves. Staff were very friendly, especially after we told them we had heard about the place on Trip Advisor. Food was just OK for us. We had been to a lot of 'local' eats before this and had breakfast for much cheaper, so it seemed expensive - as per others reviews remember to add 10% service charge and 7% gst to the price. Menu had a lot of options and there emphasised being healthier. We got one Awesome Set with duck which was nice though sould have had more duck, a spirulina drink which had far more than a 'splash' of lime for my liking (I couldn't drink it), a couple of expressos which were OK, bread with scrambled eggs and a bowl of museli. All in all it was about $65
4
Opens 9.30am to night. 202 Telok Ayer Street. It's in town & few minutes walking distance from MRT - Telok Ayer or Tanjong Pagar stations.Two of us decided to go for a nice breakfast; somewhere new and somewhere away from our familiar neighbourhood. Loved this old charm concept cafe. Situated along an old row of shophouses.For $18 + 10% service charge + 7% gst, we each had the Awesome Set comprising:-@ brioche bread (it's a French bread), @ fresh salad (very fresh), @ scrambled eggs (perfectly done and warm), @ tomatoes, @ choice of meat (I had bacon - slightly disappointed. Not crispy & not served piping hot but it was not so salty so it was healthier. Maybe I should have asked for it to be crispy), @ unsweetened oats with fresh berries (they offer honey to sweeten it)@ coffee / tea (I chose latte. They offer it with brown sugar)Serving was sufficiently nice, kept us full past tea time. All staff were friendly. If not for the bacon, would have given it a 5 star rating. Will come back again for other dishes. WORTH VISITING
5
This place rocks! I loved the menu as it had so many healthy and vegetarian food options. I probably loved the menu as much as I loved the interior design. The staff is super friendly and motivated and does everything to make your visit great. I will definitely be back
5
I came across this cafe while browsing TripAdvisor and after reading the reviews, I was interested in visiting. There are number options to choose from such as salads, sandwiches, breakfast options some of which are available during certain hours and others all day. There are also a number of drink options available such as tea, coffee, protein shakes, juices and cocktails. Take and your time and you won't be disappointed. I had the quinoa salad with pesto and with the additional chicken. The salad was perfectly portioned for a lunch meal and I combined it with some lemonade. It was filling and the best meal to have before continuing with the sightseeing.The prices are reasonable and the service just as amazing. The waiters are helpful and offer suggestions to make your visit wonderful. The cafe stands out and is decor is inviting. You can understand why making a booking or coming early is essential. The places gets packed quickly. It is located in central business district of Singapore and seems to be a lunchtime favourite for office workers nearby. The nearest MRT station is Telok Ayer and the cafe is within a 5 minute walk. Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place Interchange are also nearby and are a less than 10 minute walk
4
I know Franck from a workshop and visited for drinks a few times. However I've never really eaten there. Then I came for lunch and it was so good, exceeded my expectation, a lot of restaurants have not so fresh salad leaves as you can see the edge of the veggies are getting brown, but it's not the case for Awesome cafe, salad was fresh and looked well hand picked. A great place to come back over and over again. The staffs were really friendly and helpful, felt really positive being here
5
The reviews on Trip Advisor led us to this location, and we were not disappointed. In fact, we were pleased well beyond our expectation. The atmosphere was hip and happening, the music was jamming, and the food was most delightful. We ordered the Duck Confit Burger (full - get the half because we ate too much) and the Thai beef salad, and both ROCKED our world. Full of flavor with each bite. The salads comes with a house made dressing that is super delicious. Moreover, the "burger" comes with a small salad, which is why there is no need to get a full size sandwich for just two people.The designer of the restaurant is named Bong, and he is quite the treat! He chatted us up about the formation and design of the restaurant, and he even walked us to a back street which led us directly to Chinatown, our next adventure.The prices are typical Singapore, however, the food is much better than anything we've had in Singapore. We hope to go back tonight for our final meal in country/city

1. If you're worry about your vitamins and nutrients intake, don't worry, their superfoods series drinks feature superfoods which gives you the nutrients you need in a day. Don't worry about eating different Colours and vegetables a day. 2. If you're worry about the portion, don't worry, it's enough to get you filled up. The texture of the food definitely gets a thumbs up by Gordon Ramsay. Flavouring is just nice. 3. If you just wanna chill or gossip, the ambience and IPA is enough to get you wrecking balls like Miley or twerking like anaconda. 4. Watched kitchen nightmare and hear gordon ramsay rant about the cleanliness? Fret not, you can see every Chef in the kitchen, clean and shiny Wares. With so many decos around, I'm amazed with the Mom existence dust. 5. If you're gathering don't forget to get some platters, I had sausage platters, you ain't gonna find another place that serve up something bigger, thicker and juicer than anything you put in your mouth before. With the mustard (not sure if it's Dijon or grain) sauce provided, you simply can O from it. 6. Bonus note, from the staff to customer, your eyes get a feast of cute chicks and hunks around. And it's near Tanjong Pagar mrt exit!
5
A cozy and smart café full of young people. Here you can find sandwiches, salads and some hot dishes. I took the vegetable salad and it was tasty and filling.
5
Read the reviews and decided to give this nearby cafe a try for our last Singapore meal before flying out. Well-named the food and service was indeed awesome - thanks so much!
5
I highly recommend the Awesome breakfast set.
The flat white is so creamy, the bread is baked to a perfect status. And the smoke salmon tastes awesome along with salad.
3
Average breakfast. drinks were poor. the light bulb glass interesting concept but contained flavored water at best. decor/ vibe was good. Service commendable. Hard to find a reason to come back
5
After heading to a cafe that told me they couldn't cater to gluten free we headed to this cafe!!The interior looked very inviting and the staff were so friendly from the start! I can't have gluten, dairy or nuts and the waiter was able to tell me about the dishes and also was able change the quinoa salad and not put pesto in!!The food was very fresh, good size portions and amazing!If I was there for longer I would have gone back!
4
The decor is awesome, the salad is awesome,the bread is awesome,music is awesome,the service is super awesome!! the coffee is not at a level of awesome yet I would say, the sandwich is superb, but too big to Asian consumers/kids,would be good if different sizes could be offered
5
It's always a pleasure to be back at MAC. Was here last year May. I see there are changes to the menu! Tried the duck burger as recommended and it was so so good! Instead of burger bun, it was brioche! The brioche was toasted and soft, it was such a great combination! One of the staffs recommended the dragon martini after I had my main and I decided to give it a shot! So if you are looking for something to wow you, try the dragon martini! It has a mixture of dragon ginseng wine and it was cutely garnished with star anise and cinnamon! Thank you guys for your great service! Will be back to visit again! :
5
Went for a late lunch and was impressed with the service and the food. Great menu if you are looking for some lighter options. This is a great place if you are looking for a break from the deep fried, fatty foods available in many places in Singapore. They also have an extensive drinks menu, wine , beer and lots of cocktails if you so choose to. Definitely recommend it if you are in the area.
5
Staying in Singapore for a week I wanted to experience some western food and I fell into this quirky cafe located between Chinatown and the CBD by coincidence whilst exploring the city on a Saturday. The place was crowded with an eclectic mix of body builders, local hipsters and visiting tourists. I also saw some families and even a dog. Food was served in generous portions, I loved my awesome salad the signature dish. The staff were amazing especially quite a few french speaking which made me feel at home. This is a place not to miss when visiting Singapore!
5
We were introduced to My Awesome Cafe by our friends llving in Singapore who seem to have adopted the place as their second home - and we can see why! We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. Thank you to all the lovely staff - you are a great team, creating a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. We had a variety of delicious platters and lots of lovely drinks. I think I remember that the honey vodka was very good
5
We went there for breakfast, they offer an interesting formula for breakfast: coffee, omelet, good bread and cereals. Very friendly staff and nice location!
5
I came here for a light dinner and it was just the right place. They have excellent salads and sandwiches, the seating is super casual, and the music is at the perfect volume for conversation.
2
Quite disappointed with the breakfast menu, only few options with most are instant food. Coffee & tea are also not so good. Not sure any customer would visit here again.
5
Delicious Sandwiches. Not cheap but worth the money. Crowded, loud music, but nice and authentic atmosphere.
2
went on tripadvisor recommendation, great ambience and location. unfortunately, if you are looking for above average food and coffee, there are better place in the area.
4
Came here a week ago with my friend for brunch. the food is good and the waitress that served us was really friendly.
5
This is such a great cafe. Very friendly staff and super food.And no matter how busy it is (which is almost at every moment of the day), the staff takes the time to have a chat with you and give good recommendations what to eat and drink. A must to visit when you are in Singapore
4
Had a lovely meal, nice and chilled vibe for some good quality food. I personally had thai beef wraps and they were excellent. The staff (especially Jules) were awesome (saved the pun for this bit) and we talked for a while about life and travels which was great and nice to see. Highly recommend for anyone trying to get away from the high-priced scene of Singapore but wants to keep the quality close
3
Wonderful experience to dine here. The place is over decorated with too much stuff covering a very broad theme. But foods are quite tasty. Just that too much fat after putting on the grill pan. For simplicity sake the bread on toast (butter and kaya) with the black coffee maybe the best on offer.
4
We have been on a journey and eaten a lot of amazing food, so we had higher expectations to this cafe than what was fulfilled. Do not misunderstand me: I have nothing bad to say, but due to the ranking I expected a lot more. We had lunch in the area the day after, and in our opinion that was a better experience. So if you go here with no expectations you probably will be very satisfied. But we think there are better (and cheeper) places to eat brunch/lunch in Singapore.
5
The staff is super friendly, drinks and food are of top quality and affordable, definitely a place to try in singapore
4
Great place with a very nice amosphere. Wonderful service and very good food. The prices average for Singapore (that means it is not a cheap place :-))
5
What can I say the best place in Singapore for breakfast and with multiple choices of meat or seafood to go with the eggs. I choose duvk breast. Yum cooked to perfection. We will come back time and time again.
4
Once you have worked you way around the menu and ordered, the food was amazing and the setting is very cool, very eclectic place well worth a visit
4
If you work around Telok Ayer, chances are you already know this place. It's at its peak on Friday nights, with post-work crowd. Service is excellent, prices are a bit steep.
5
I been here twice which was 8 months ago and Chris still remember me by saying "welcome back" it means a lot to me!Chris never forget my favorite drinks "king martini" which I will have everytime when I'm back. This time around Chris recommended me the dragon martini which contain with herbs and it was Fantabulous!Definitely will be back and recommend to all!Thank you to all service team and special mention to Chris!
5
We stopped over on our honeymoon and have had a wonderful breakfast and a super tasty lunch. The whole team was amazing and we felt like spending time with friends. The food was fresh and the juices healthy. Prices were absolutely fair. We'd love to come back. And thanks Roland for the lift
2
Surprised at the reviews here are the specifics. Ordered a signature drink made of coconut water for 9 $ the least I expected was atleast fresh coconut water instead it was made of the 1 $ canned coconut water with the machine cut pieces of coconut . Thai curry clearly made of green curry paste and tasteless . Salad, smoked salmon one. Greens average dressing sparse and well not tasty but decent quality smoked salmon . A warm quinoa dish with chicken absolutely tasteless canâ€™t describe but suffices to say could finish half the plate. Two stars for the ambience old but tasteful
5
We went to this restaurant based on their google reviews. It was late at night and we needed somewhere to have dinner. This cafe was open until midnight so made the walk from Chinatown MRT, and it was well worth it. The food portions were large and the food itself was really good. I would definitely recommend this cafe. The mojito I had was delicious aswell, and very welcome after a long hot day walking around :
5
This is a very quaint and comfortable place to visit, especially if you are travelling in the area or work around here. I wasn't blown away by the food, but then again I'm a foodie so I have pretty high standards (if I do say so myself...) in this regard. If you like the look of the place and have never visited a "shophouse" eatery in Asia before, then you should drop in! Since it's sort of in the business district too (at least on its fringes), best to avoid going there during peak (such as lunch time) hours though if you can
5
Amazing Bar/Cafe/Restaurant in the charming Telok Ayer Street!
Friendly staff, great food (we especially like the sharing platters) and wine... What more do we want?!
4
I have eaten the salads here twice. Big portion and you can actually see and bite on the duck in the duck salad, not just imagine it being there. And it tastes good!
5
An amazing bar with a lot of atmosphere, a great selection of drinks and very tasty food. Staff are extremely friendly and welcoming and definitely worth a visit.
5
My Awesome Cafe is basically pretty awesome! The staff is super friendly. The food options are healthy and delicious. I loved the cafe decor. It is just a really cool spot with great food!
5
My wife and I discovered this cafe in Singapore and had a truely wonderful night out. The atmosphere is upbeat, the food is simple , fresh, and plentiful. The wine list extensive and reasonably priced for Singapore and the staff and hosts are incredibly friendly and welcoming. In a city that can be rather stiff this place is a breath of fresh air. We went on a Friday night and it was very busy. The crowd was a mixture of locals, students and tourists which made for a lively relaxed atmosphere. We even scored a complementary glass of wine and dessert from the hosts, who are an amazing couple of guys . So if you don't want to get too dressed up or pay through the nose for some expensive jumped up restaurant,but would rather a fun night out, in a friendly relaxed venue with a great atmosphere and an extensive range of healthy, fresh , comfort food with a french twist..then please try this awesome cafe...and get there early to catch the cheaper drinks at "Awesome Hour"....cheers, we will be back
5
Impromptu brunch plan and despite staying in singapore for last 2.5 plus years we never really explored much of brunch places. So Husband and I decided let's do a brunch and reached out to TripAdvisor as usual. The staff was awesome and Super friendly. So much so that they saw confusion on our faces while we were looking at the menu and assisted us in ordering. They have all options starting from vegetarian to vegan to lactose and gluten intolerant. Food of course was good and so does coffee. Ambience is also rustic and nice. Would definitely recommend the place. Price is a bit on higher side but you feel worth it when you compare the overall experience
5
This was our first visit. Love the eclectic decor and the creative clutter. Adds an interesting atmosphere to our breakfast!The menu was extensive and we really struggled to make a decision. Luckily we were given really good advice. The sharing platters are exactly that! Don't underestimate how much food it is. We wanted 2 platters but we're strongly advised to just do 1! The bacon platter was outstanding! Great selection of protein shakes which my hubby loved!We are definitely going back to try all the other platters! Loved the food and experience
5
Great (awesome) place for food and drinks with a massive (awesome) selection of salads, sandwiches, hot food, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. Relaxed and chilled (awesome) atmosphere whether it's breakfast , lunch, snacks or evening drinks you are having.Staff are friendly, engaging and helpful (awesome), making this cafe bar a fab (awesome) place all round.
5
Friend's recommendation for a healthy lunch. Had a salmon salad and was pleasantly surprised by how big & how good they made it (not just a bowl of dry leaves). Actually, a bit too large a portion I struggled to finish (which is rare). Service is friendly and efficient, and the ambience is great -- airy space open to the streets, quirky interiors with nice lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Spent a long lunch catching up, and would definitely go back to try more of their menu
4
We were there for breakfast. Really cool location were you can have good meal. But as it is normal for Singapur you habe to pay a little more
5
true to its name, awesome service crew and hyper- thank you for the good service :)
drinks are nice and reasonably priced.
5
Very accommodating and fun crew! Interesting theme. Thanks for making my sister's birthday memorable.
5
Great vibe...super friendly service...delicious duck platter accompanied by great wine...was just the perfect after work setting for a catch up. Will be back for more.
4
We walked past this place after being at the local hawkers centre. The beers are varied and different and the food looked good for sharing.
A good atmosphere and a open enytamce made for a relaxed and fun place.
5
Really is an awesome cafe, food was amazing and the staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome.
5
I have been based in Singapore for a little more than 3 years and was lucky enough to live near My Awesome CafÃ©. I cannot say enough good things about this place, its staff and its ambiance. I have invited friends, dates, family members and clients there. Everyone's opinion is the same: this place is awesome. So just go. Cheers. Jerom
5
This is a very retro & quaint cafe, rich with history which I was told ,open daily till 2359hrs .Great sandwiches & all day breakfast... a good compliment of wine too . All the staff are very friendly , foods good ... will be back 
4
Absolutely loved the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. Had a good experience food and drinks wise. It was just a bit too noisy to enjoy a conversation. But would definitely go back!
5
We visited here for breakfast and it was an awesome experience. A beautiful little restaurant where you can sit out at the street or inside in the cool air conditioning. Not many breakfast options come with wine, but this one does if you want it to. Great coffee as well for the coffee lovers. Staff were wonderful and very attentive to our every need. Careful ladies, they have a very attractive, charismatic young waiter with a suave accent, that could sell ice to an Eskimo. And the young lady they had keeping and eye on our table was both adorable and part greyhound (only on the sense of speed) When we turned to speak, she was at our side with a warm smile like a bolt of lightning, returning with what ever we requested post haste. Prices were very fair for the quality of food. It was beautiful and fresh, full of wonderful flavors. You can have a little or you can have allot. A fabulous experience, absolutely fabulous. Treat yourself, you deserve it.
5
We had a wonderful breakfast at this cafe on our last day in Singapore. Our waiter was Jules (hope spelling is correct), a young Frenchman. He provided excellent food service but also gave us great tips about sight-seeing in Singapore. His energy and enthusiasm for the city and the cafe was genuine and infectious. We had such a great time that we returned that evening for dessert and champagne before our long flight back to the states. Jules was still there--he remembered our names and stopped by to thank us for coming by. A great restaurant experience! Can I give the service six stars

We truly have a great night with friends, amazing service and great sharing plates. The guys here are taking great care of us and just had an unforgettable night... not to be missed:)

Very cozy place for brunch. Efficient staff and delicious food! Authentic decoration! Very nice place!

The Belgian Association of Singapore booked My Awesome Cafe for their end of year party - and they were happy they did. Communication, organisation, before the event as well as on the evening itself was flawless. Staff were friendly and helpful in serving the food at the buffet as well as presenting it to us on platters. The food itself was plenty, well priced and delicious. And last but not least: the atmosphere was great. We had an awesome party - thank you awesome cafe.
5
Sundays are made a lot less dull with the people, food and atmosphere here at My Awesome Cafe. Not many cafes are open in the CBD area on Sundays, but they are! I hang out here every week coz it's simply too awesome. Their brunch going at $18 is value for money whilst their drinks like this drinkable idea is the healthiest thing ever. woohoo!
5
Had a great breakfast one morning here when in Singapore on holidays. Wife is vegan and was well catered for. Good tea and coffee. Food is excellent and the wait staff very friendly. Also a great location, tucked just outside the busy business down townarea. Close to plenty of attractions.
5
Today I had lunch with my partner at My Awesome Cafe and it was (of course) awesome! I had the awesome salad and my boyfriend had the three cheese. They were totally delicious and at $16 for those portions we were over the moon! I can see why it has such great reviews. Thanks for the delicious lunch guys.
5
I cannot rave enough about My Awesome Cafe: the ambiance, decor and huge selection of food, the friendly and prompt service.....what else could you ask for? The food is amazingly fresh. They do a wonderful job of importing some fantastic ingredients from around the world. I highly suggest the Idea Bulb drink and the Duck Burger! Enjoy :
5
Cool, hip, genuine and kind, the boyzz and galzz at My Awesome Cafe prepare awesomely and awesomely serve awesome food: healthy salads, power cocktails and bespoke wines to their awesome clients who are cool, hip, genuine and mostly kind too. Interesting to see how the atmosphere results from the sincere & friendly interaction between staff and patrons. Kindness is key and Bong, Franck & the multinational and multi-ethnic staff demonstrate this principle effortlessly to the glee of everyone around
5
We had our second visit here today and again, not disappointed. Fresh food, attentive staff, buzzing atmosphere in a wonderful area of Singapore. Easy to find and a nice walk from the Fairmont Hotel. Every customer made to feel awesome.
5
A fantastic team, great food, wonderful atmosphere! Not only in their unique cafe but also on location. Do not hesitate to engage them for your parties at home! They made our farewell party unforgettable.
Sad we only discovered them so late.

I went there on a Saturday afternoon and I can tell I was blown away by the friendly happy atmosphere and the quality of the food. Portions are generous, and they also have some really good wine at affordable price.
I recommend!
5
Good food, awesome environment. The staff is super friendly.
We ordered the plate of cheese and it was really good. We enjoy everything.
5
Lovely staff lovely food lovely drinks!!! I feel like home here!
Beef lasagne and duck breast wrap is da bomb here!
For health/gym freaks... there's protein menu for you to drool on!
really awesome!
5
The packed restaurant itself will tell many a tale!Was there last afternoon with a friend and both of us had a great experience.We had sandwiches and they were delicious. Simple, uncomplicated yet packed with flavour. The bread was lovely.Considering how packed the restaurant was... the service was good.TIP: If you can hold your hunger till about 130 in the afternoon...the crowd thins down...Just a bit! You gotta visit!
3
With a name like that you'd expect something great. Dry bread with some meat on the top. Coffee and atmosphere was ok.
5
This was the best meal I had in Singapore - fresh ingredients, delicious & innovative menu items - and great prices! The sausage platter is a MUST have. As is the My Awesome Salad! (Everything is great for sharing!)Also, the kindest, most caring, nurturing owners of a restaurant I have ever met.
5
We love awesome cafe in Singapore! We went to Singapore for a short trip. We were tired of hotel breakfast buffet. So we decided to take a short walked to have our breakfast outside the hotel. Sure enough,we walked into this Awesome cafe by chance. So happy we did! An came the awesome breakfast and the awesome coffee. The coffee reminded us of " le cafe creme " in Paris France. How awesome is that!! And the awesome host "Mr. Frank" the owner of the awesome cafe was a very cool guy. He came to have some friendly chat with us. We were very impressed. If ever in Singapore again, Mr. Frank, for sure we will visit you and your awesome cafe!
5
I landed here to meet a business acquintance. She does all her meetings here. So I decided to land early and have my breakfast here. But before we get to the food, the place in itself is rustic and no frills. The ambience makes u feel at home and the service is fast and polite. Since it was a business meeting, I couldn't pay too much attention to the food. But it's a cafe that I wish to visit again on my next trip to Singapore
5
Visited twice, once for breakfast, then dinner.
Great cafe in a lovely old Singaporean street. Quirky decor, fantastic staff, lovely food.
Thoroughly recommend this cafe. Had a chat with Frank the owner, made us feel so welcome, like old friends.
5
This seems like a place not many Singaporeans are eating at, but it completely hit the spot! Super fresh salads, refreshing drinks and Ice Cream!! It completely met our needs and left us happy and satiated!! Yum!!
5
A really good place to have a great time. Awesome food, awesome staff, awesome place ! One of my fav place in Singapore... or wait IT IS my fav place!
Really great, love it!

Awesome breakfast tops our list.. good food, good service. Simply awesome!! We also ordered beef lasagna, cool glasses where to put your drinking water.
5
Friendly and welcoming owner and staff whom help us with our project. Showed us around the unique cafe and answered to our questions. The cafe was vibrant and unique with historical and heritage furniture.

This cute little cafe was a lovely place to stop and rest our feet and get a delicious dessert and a great cup of coffee. The staff is outstanding and very friendly. The decor in the cafe is amazing as you can see by the picture. Our dessert was so delicious it just made us want more. This is a must stop as you're walking through Singapore

My GF and I were recently in Singapore on business and I asked her to find us a place for dinner. After looking at some reviews she chose this place.At night its not that easy to find because the sign is small. We walked past it at first but we saw a place with people overflowing into the street and went back and found it. I thought we would have trouble getting seated but the staff whisked us away to a small table inside in the midst of the action. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, look elsewhere.This is a small place but comfortable and seemed to be mostly local people meeting up with friends for some drinks and food. It is relatively loud from the voices, laughing, and shouts all around you but that means you don't have to speak to your companion in hushed tones to keep others from hearing. The house music, an eclectic selection I really liked, could even be heard over the din.The menu is very diverse with many dishes that have a new twist on old ingredients. We saw so many things we wanted to order on the menu we left with a lot of food. My pork with salad was very tasty, which I supplemented with the great mixed olives and then topped off with the bread pudding. Don't forget to try one or more of the signature house drinks which, again, have a different twist. See the photos which show what I'm describing. Next time I'm in Singapore I'll be back. Oh, and the staff, to a person, were amiable and helpful
5
Great little find! Amazing food and wine, fantastic service from Franck and the team! The guys know the menu inside out and gave great recommendations. The chocolate box is a really nice touch, and the lightbulb glass that you get to take away is very cool!!Will be back again and again - a new Favourite in singapore!
5
Lots of things to praise @ My Awesome Cafe but to be honest it is the staff that make the difference - They are very friendly/helpful and it’s always good to see them again. Drinks list is comprehensive and food is always good as well. You really can’t go wrong
5
The coffee is great here as is the Bacon and Eggs. It's a French twist on the B&E but it was Flavoursome and HOT. There isn't a great variety available for breakfast but that enables them to focus and get it right. The host is very welcoming and sees it as his job to make his guests happy. The decor is original and the building is a heritage old Singaporean beauty.We'll be back
5
As we try and find unique places in Singapore this place kept coming up. Great character food and vibe at my awesome cafe.
5
Good food in a relaxing and friendly atmosphere,
The cheese and meat platter was delicious and reasonably priced.
5
That place really deserves its name. Awesome food and awesome staff - we enjoyed a yummy salad and a superb sandwich. Thank you
5
Great place! Good service, excellent food with fresh ingredients! Must visit! And a very friendly owner.
5
I would highly recommend this cafe, super lovely! Nice salad, it's chicken tastes very soft and easy chewing. Flat white was wonderful as well. Would love to try at night to chill with friends next time
5
We went twice. Once for coffee and once for lunch. Excellent fresh food with a french twist. Recommend the crab salad and also the cold meat platter. Really good coffee. Very friendly accommodating staff, led by Franck. Eclectic group of people there..locals, visitors. Turns into a Bistro/wine bar at nightHighly Recommende

I craved for fresh awesome croissant hand made by The Awesome Cafe Owner Franck Hardy. I gave a tried calling them in the cafe to see if they can open earlier at 8.30am instead of 9.30am just for my friends and me as we were so hungry and since I am just few blocks away from their cafe. To my surprise the answer is "come no worries I will open earlier just for you since the bakes are almost ready." I truly felt so honoured and thankful. I ate the best fresh croissants and tasty salad plus the awesome ambience with such nice owner of the cafe smiling and serving us made our breakfast the best experience ever! Thanks you so much though I should not mention about the exceptional timing they have Open their cafe just because we requested as we were so hungry but I sincerely wish to thank them for being so kind to accept our special request. My Awesome cafe is truly Awesome
5
Must visit when in the area. The venue is super cozy and the interior so different compare to the rest of Singapore's Cafe/Restaurant and Bar scene.Always feel welcome by the super friendly staff. Food is healthy and offers something for every taste.Same for their drinks. Love their Cocktails and the wines which are reasonable priced.Definitely a good place to hang with Friends for drinks or just having a good meal and observing the buzz
5
My Awesome Cafe is one of my go-to lunch / drinks / casual dinner spots in Singapore.It truly is awesome by name, awesome by nature!The staff are friendly, welcoming and attentive. Franck (the main man) is often there getting stuck in and being the wonderful man that he is.The menu is epic - so much choice! - and the kitchen are totally accommodating if you want to tweak things to your preferences and tastes. They use fresh, quality ingredients. The salads are delicious and the portions are all generous. There are plenty of healthy superfoods available on the menu too - including spirulina shakes and yummy protein shake combos.The atmosphere is one that you just want to stick around and be a part of. Super chilled vibe, whilst also being edgy, individual and cool. There's really nowhere else like it in Singapore. Go!!! You won't regret it.
5
Friendly excellent just awesome! Genuinely caring and very good food using fresh ingredients, great whisky selection.Fantastic place to chill and have a coffee middle of the afternoon, a drink with friends at night or a nice lunch with colleagues.Keep up the amazing work, team
5
Love this cafe. Located at the old shop lot- very unique . Food is greta . Ambience cool. Staffs are friendly.
5
Both the sallad and The lasagna was amazing! The staff is just the best. If you are nearby you need too eat here! Highly recommend!
2
Service is nice, kind of cool interior design and decoration.
Not very confortable seat, tables and arragement.
Food is boring, average, quantity is big though.
5
I like everything.it is a very good place, great hospitality.Thanks for great food and drinks.When you go to singapore you should visit this place.
5
We highly recommend My Awesome Cafe for an Amazing Breakfast experience while in Singapore. The cafe is located in a lovely colonial looking street setting. The food was great, and the staff were AWESOME! We will definitely go back again...
5
Very friendly staff and great menu! Just go and experience this café/restaurant.
When we were there it wasn't too crowded; just perfect on a Sunday evening!
5
Everything about the place is terrific. The owners have put their hearts and souls into making this one of the very best places in the CBD to hang out for food and drinks. The decor is old school cool, the staff are beacons of sunshine, and the food..let's just say the best sandwiches in town. Stella on draft as well. Absolutely love it and my new after work loca

I walked by this restaurant one evening, having never traveled to Singapore and having little knowledge of the food options in the area. It was flooded with people and was overflowing in the streets. It was the first place we saw, so my friend and I continued exploring and ended up eating elsewhere that evening. The following morning, in search of breakfast, we noticed this same cafe was once again bustling. Upon inspecting the menu and the "awesome breakfast" option which included eggs, brioche toast, salad, grain oatmeal, and choice of smoked duck, smoked salmon, bacon, or vegetarian, we decided to have a seat. My friend ordered the smoked duck which was absolutely superb and incredibly tender. Every facet of the prepared plate was beyond our expectations. Upon completion of our incredible meal, we had a 20 minute conversation with the owner, who provided the story of how My Awesome Cafe came about 4 years ago. My friend and I were incredibly impressed with the quality of food and service that was provided. We will return to My Awesome Cafe and will encourage others visiting Singapore to do the same
5
The place is perfectly located, well decorated between old and modern. I loved the buffet with ham, duck rillettes, grilled vegetables, home made guacamole and deserts, and fabulous cheeses. Great variety and quality of drinks too! I felt at home thanks to the very welcoming staff. I advise the place for corporate events and I think I'll go again with friends.Thanks again

I visited the restaurant on Thursday around 11:45am just to check the place out. I had made a Friday night reservation for dinner for four to try out the food with some friends. My only purpose was to see the restaurant atlunch time to see if it should be considered for my daughter's 16th birthday party. The staff was nice in letting me come inside to check it out. The owner was the one that upset me. I tried to tell him why I was there, but he just ignored everything I said and hinted that I was not welcome since the lunch rush would be starting in five minutes. ( He said that several times.) There were only few people seated at the time and I just had two questions, which were already answered by his staff. I was just looking at the decor for few minutes in considering to have the party for a 16 year old girl. I told the owner that I'll be back to try the food on Friday night, but then he gave me a disgusted look. I guess he thought I wanted to come back on Friday to discuss the party during his busy time? Of course not!Well, after that experience, I cancelled my reservation and we went else where for dinner. I tried a new restaurant and had a fine time. For the 16th birthday party, I booked Limoncello at Robertson Quay.

Franck the owner works in the front line and is always greeting regulars, travellers and newbies with his warm, French flair! The cafe is well organised and finding a table is usually painless. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable and the food is delicious.
5
Great vibe and great food!!! Cool staff and location. Had the duck sandwich which was really great!!
5
This place is something else.
I was alone and just going to grab takeaway, but ended up staying an hour+ for drinks, a birthday cake and the company of the people I met there.
This was the highlights of my short business trip in SG.
5
Walking around I stumbled upon this cafe. Because of the music I walked in to the cafe and looked at the card. Decent prices so i orderedâ€‹ the lasagna, felt like lasagna that evening. Also had a good talk with the owner and how he set up the place. To cut it short: the lasagna was awesome and the beers were awesome
5
If you want a quick bite, or a slow enjoyable lunch, in the cool air-conditioning, or by the side walk,If you like eco-friendly concept and eclectic design,If you enjoy French food (alamat, not the super fancy expensive one), casual, tasty and so traditional that you just need to close your eyes to be in Southern France,HERE YOU ARE: MY AWESOME CAFERelaxed, friendly staff, authentic French food (actually there is a French chef there, but secret, he hides as an Aussie waiter), truly French food from the South, then this should become your secret Heaven.Excellent Wines from the world, Variety of food, from salads (see picture) to full menu. All simple but super tasty, super healthy food (southern version), excellent ingredients, great place.I LOVE MY AWESOME CAFE.(although it is not mine! Not even sure if the chef-owner-waiter noticed my visit. Hiding by the corner!!).Open late hours.This is a golden egg, a lovely niche for food lovers (without pretention!), and affordable. $$ only

Do drop by to enjoy good food and drinks in Awesome place in CBD.
The cafe offers good sandwiches, wraps and salads.

Amazing location, exquisite food, loooooovely people, it is just the best gem nestled in the middle of chinatown!
Beautifullll ❤❤❤
5
Always a great place to catch up with friends or businesspeople , fun and easy going concept , many small details in the design, always big smiles and great service from the team
5
Had a great time this week with my huge group of friends for a birthday celebration and my comment is "AWESOME".Did my enquiry to check on the arrangement and Franck responsed to all my queries swiftly and provided all the necessary suggestions to help with the planning Thanks to the Awesome team for making this a wonderful and special nite for our birthday boy PS... those comments on "hungry goes where"... luckily I did not trust them
5
Excellent vegetarian salad, reminds me the flavours of Sydney! Good avo, flavoursome cranberries and amazing freshly baked bread! My boyfriend had a salmon sandwich - the bread wins it all! It's super good. Drinks were good as well, my ginger and honey drink was super tasty, but the spirulina one was not the favourite. All was very very good!
3
There's really nothing awesome about this cafe. I applaud the owners pride in having a cafe but the ambiance and food are really just regular. Salads which one could easily prepare at home and juice blends which were over price given the surroundings.Don't visit on a hot or rainy day. High chances of getting wet with rain or sweat in either case.A redeeming factor is their Good coffee 
4
We popped in to this place based on recommendations in Tripadvisor. Voila! Duck plate is super tasty, crispy duck meat, foe grais super delicious, but portions are big, easily for sharing. Budget friendly, cheap, cozy interior but we choose to sit outside bar tables where you can watch the buzz on the street, looking towards beautiful architecture where behind glass skyscrapers. Lets not exaggerate, if you are around can easily visit have breakfast/lunch..
3
Stumbled across this place whilst exploring China Town. Ordered an "I am awesome" salad and sandwich. Both were simple with fresh ingredients, a welcome change from noodles and rice for past 3 weeks.. made me sentimental of back home in Australia, as reminded me of walking into Coles for lunch and picking up a bag of pre-washed salad, and cold cuts from the deli.
5
I am pretty picky about where I choose to eat out or have social gatherings with friends. My Awesome Cafe has become the go to place to have an awesome time (pun intended) regardless of the occasion. The owners Franck Bong and Roland are experts at making you feel comfortable and go above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your visit to their cafe. The staff are extremely friendly and the food is really good with some items that really wow you. I highly recommend ' My Awesome Salad ' and the ' French Duck Confit ' for those of you with a sweet tooth the upside down pineapple cake will hit you in all the right spots! If you are looking for the best cafe in Singapore for all the right reasons then definitely visit My Awesome Cafe
5
It takes a lot to make me happy and this place does, from breakfast through to diner the service rocks.The food is awesome, the drinks are awesome, I love the share plates, love the cocktails, you can not go wrong here.The fit out is bonkers and I love it, so many elements happening, something to catch your eye everywhere you look.Well done Awesome tea
4
Food is yummy, everything is fresh, portions are generous and the interior is really well thought through! Just what you need to conclude that this is indeed an awesome place.
5
I've been here a couple of times and I always liked the vibe. My most recent experience included a freshly baked slice of pineapple upside-down cake and Baileys on coconut ice-cream that is to-die-for. Highly recommended for a relaxed evening with friends.
5
Its rare for me to come in to Town on a Sunday but I must say today's trip was worth it as I enjoyed their Breakfast set . Nice coffee and excellent service! Recommending to everyone!
1
Based on TripAdvisor rating, I visited this cafe on a Saturday morning for breakfast. The staff is nice to allow me to be seated 10 mins before opening time. The shop signage in Chinese means Chinese Traditional Meditation. The decorations is something like Chinese New Year with the kind of deco in Chinese wedding. The single small desk allows solo customer to be not out-of-place. I asked for recommendations and they recommended breakfast menu. The portion is a good size. But I can cook better than this. Nothing impressive and so it the taste. Not impressed with the taste. The scramble eggs are too dry. It's definitely overrated. Not worth trying
5
Thanks so much to all the staff at My Awesome Cafe for hosting our football clubs post charity event food and drinks on Sunday 9th April.The service was fantastic throughout the day, with all guests especially loving the food platters and signature drinks!Very impressive to see the cafe still cater for other guests as well, squeezing tables in so no one was turned away! This made for a truly 'awesome' atmosphere for everyone! We can't wait to enjoy the food and hospitality of the awesome family again soon!Thanks so much
5
Singapore is a bustle - let's face it. To be immediately welcomed and made to feel as though your are part of the family from the moment you sit down till the moment you lick the plate clean (as the food is to die for) makes visiting My Awesome CafÃ© one of my first things to do every time I get to Singapore.Franck and the crew are the best people and even if you have never been there before, by the time you leave you will be family. You MUST come here!!
3
First of all, food is terrible. we ordered a sandwich set and the bread was hard and dry, ham was tastless. basil chicken was nice however.and the coffee they make us was terrible, bitter like Chinese medicine (maybe they did it to match the deco of this place?)the deco is AWESOME tho. we and my girl had a blast taking photos. we aimed to take pic there so we woke up early to be the first group of customer. we took over 50 pic each before the other customer came in. the happy hour drink menu look alot better than breakfast one. maybe i will try the happy hour nx tim
5
Awesome isn't strong enough for this fantastic lively restaurant. Crawling with both visitors and youngish business people from the surrounding area, this place has friendly servers and great food. Highly recommend the "awesome salad" where they fly in five types of mesquite salad from Australia twice a week. Includes chicken, duck and smoked salmon; I added prawns. My wife had the "awesome sandwich ", basically the same duck, chicken and ham.But they have an extensive menu and all kinds of interesting drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.Definitely worth a visit for lunch or dinner
5
This cafe is a must do when in Singapore. Without a doubt it has the best atmosphere you can find in the whole city. Franck and his team are the best in the business and everything is done with love and care. Not to mention, the pesto is insane!!
5
I came here based on a friend's recommendation and it did not disappoint. It's easy to find and is located less than a 5 minute walk from the Telok Ayer subway station. I had the Drinkable Idea for my drink along with the semi-dried tomato, avocado and egg salad. The whole meal was delicious and I didn't even scratch the surface of the menu - they also have a robust wine list. I will definitely be back
5
Great service, atmosphere, decor, food. The food is impeccably fresh and generous. Cafe was historically a Chinese clinic & much of its original Chinese decor remains. Kudos to Franck (the owner) for curating such an interesting concept!
5
Was here with friends and we had a blast. The food was excellent, had the Awesome Salad and huge choice of drinks. The team make this place fantastic, full of smiles and nothing is too much trouble. Highly recommend
5
Fantastic staffs and Management attentions to details. Good combinations platters with a twiss of slice pineapple that goes wild with cheese.That make me coming back for more.Blended in good combinations for the dessert too. Well baked to presentations. Lovely.So Strong in crowds and impress with the business mixture of dinners.Well served
5
We hunted this place down after reading about it on Trip Advisor. We all absolutely loved it here. Such a funky place with super friendly and knowledgeable staff. The food was delicious, especially the sandwiches, with a huge healthy menu selection. Great atmosphere, highly recommend
5
I have regular lunches during office week at my awesome cafe. That day I brought wife and son for diner. We really enjoyed this place. Salads are great. Wife and son loved those home made deserts. One thing counts very much, the atmosphere is quite unique. When the street is quiet, My Awesome Cafe is uniquely lively. We will be bac
5
2nd review for this Awesome place.The food and alcohol selection are excellent, that's a given, but what makes this place even more special are its people and their dedication to their work. They are here to make sure you have an awesome time, whether you come for breakfast, lunch, afternoon drinks or dinner. Great hard working professionals with big hearts and fun loving awesomenessDon't change 
5
Loved this place. The food was very good. The dessert we had was absolutely amazing. The service was very good. The owner, Franck came and sat with us for a while which was nice. All of the staff were very kind and welcoming. If I lived in Singapore, this would be one of my locals. Also baby friendly! Well worth a visit. You'd be mad not to, especially if you live here! Highly recommended.
5
Good place in Singapore with good food / drinks, many choices in the menu with a good quality/price ratio and also a very welcoming and efficient team. Events are easy to organize into a nice atmosphere, with music, space ( even if it s always full of people ) and confortable seats. There is no rush you can spend the time you want there and order late. Go for it ;-) 
5
Food was good, but what made the visit was the friendly staff. Not only were they happy to have a chat, but they even walked us down the street to point us in the direction of some places to check out
5
What a treat for both the body and mind! The café offers the most delicious Asian- Mediterranean food, which is served by the friendliest staff I have encountered in Singapore. I visited the place in February 2017 and the owners, Franck, Bong and Roland where all very hands-on and did their outmost to ensured that my friends and I had the best possible experience. The design is something quite remarkable. Bong who designed the restaurants have used old pipes, engine parts, twisted pieces of metal all salvaged from scrap yards and turned them into functional furniture that not only look great but are comfortable at the same time.My Awesome Café is a must for any visitors to Singapore
5
One of the best coffee shops in Singapore. Well located, great food and nice decoration is a must go.

Good crowd Good service Good food
A place to meet friends local n foreign
Unique deco

Must visit
go go go

what makes this place is the amazing owner and his great staff, food, booze and venue are also top quality.
5
Located in a nice businesses neighborhood, this places offers great salads and sandwiches in tradicional American lunch format. In weekends you can try delicious London Pride draught beer.
5
The place is amazing, is a old medical clinic building, the decorations is beautiful! Very relax and trendy with locals and expats.We had cold beers and wraps on the tables outside. The food was good and the service great
5
This café lives up to its name in all possible ways, from its über-cool, hip interior inside an old Chinese hospital, which owner Franck has lovingly designed and furnished with refurbished school desks and other vintage items, to the extensive menu which will satisfy the most discerning customer and which reflects Franck's passion for combining top quality fresh ingredients into delicious healthy dishes. Yet what puts My Awesome Café miles ahead of any competitor is something that can't be copied and reproduced: it's the awesome vibe created by Franck, Bong and their team. Everyone is part of the MAC family, which translates into top notch service and a positive energy that is shared by all

Located along Telok Ayer Street in what used to be an old Chinese hospital, in a history-rich locale, My Awesome Cafe had done a lot to preserve the rich heritage of the place. It has refurbished old school tables that are used as dining tables, and old school rotating fans to ventilate the restaurant. Besides the food, it is worth the time to explore various nook and cranny and find artifacts from the old hospital. Upstairs is now rented to an ad agency. It can get very crowded on Friday evenings and weekends. So better to make a reservation. Food waste, their signature Awesome Sandwich is a good sampler the sandwiches they served. The chicken breast sandwich was a little dry for my liking. The Beef lasagne was a little too moist. Staff are great and friendly and service is good. Hambali will engage diners and share stories of the place.Overall, a fun chillax place. One improvement would be their menu. Too much like a text book and difficult to read.
5
Very friendly staff and excellent atmosphere, we had the ocean platter over lunch and there is no critics I could make. Actully am hessitating to recommend as otherwise it will be too packed the next time. Its down to earth and not one of these high flyers - for me now a must when in Singapore. I love i
4
The lightbulb concoction is really interesting!And the drink with the wolfberry and Chinese-feel cocktails. Other than that, their kaya toast is sweet but well done, Surprised o the quality of such simple food. They provide a wide selection of breakfast items too
5
This was honestly one of the best breakfasts I have ever had on a business trip. The place is located in China town I believe as it was near some temples. The outside and inside of the restaurant are quite Chinese as well.The breakfast, however, was definitely not Chinese. The scramble eggs was delicious as well as the sausage platter and another dish I can't remember the name of, but it had parma ham. The staff was quite friendly, I mainly dealt with the guy with lots of tattoos, nice lad! My only regret is that I went there on my last day in Singapore. I will definitely go back if I return to Singapore.Oh, and be careful, their plates are quite generous ;) If you go alone, don't order the sausage platter, you will most likely not finish

Super welcoming vibe and delicious food. My favorite is the spicy beef salad. The staff are super accommodating and very friendly.

Nice sandwich cafe open on Sunday. It reminds me trendy restaurant in Paris.
Neighbourhood nice as well in the old city.
We were well served after 15:00
Price are good for this very expensive city.
For lunch break !

It's trully awesome food and drinks, service and atmosphere. Old Chinese building with industrial vintage look. The best salad, so fresh and top quality and taste. Thank you awesome crews!
5
My partner and I came here and had the chilli con carn and the vegetarian healthy salad. I am a bit of a salad snob so really enjoy taking down a good quality salad. The food here is absolutely delicious. The salad in particular was colourful, fresh and filling. Thank-you to the kind staff and the chefs, we will be back :)

After a couple of years me and my boyfriend decided to leave Singapore for some new adventures. We checked with the Team of My Awesome Café if they could assist us in hosting our Good Bye Party and they were so so accommodating in all our wishes which led to one great Party on Saturday. Awesome Team, keep on doing what you are doing and I'm sure the day we come back there will be many more memories made in your café !!! :) THANKS

We had breakfast set, and vegetarian sandwich. We like the food, served with fresh veg fillings. Interior was a delight, we loved the settings. Anyone who is in SG, and looking to spend some time in weekends, look no further.

Thank you Franck, Bong and My Awesome Cafe staff for helping me plan and host a fabulous 40th birthday celebration for Chris. Everything was just perfect - the food was yummy (duck rillettes' my favourite), they were beautifully presented, and service was top notch (everyone's glasses were always filled, you got my slideshow working and even made a figurine of our cat for the cake!). You guys are truly truly awesome!!! Xox

It is really hard to describe the "Awesomeness" of what Franck and the team have created here. The Food - Excellent. Fresh (salad flies in from Australia 3 times a week). Plenty of choices for everyone (vegetarians included).The Atmosphere - Magical. Dreamy. This place is a true germ and will soon become your home away from home. Loved the special lanterns they had to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The music is perfect as well. Not too loud, changing between Jazz and Loungy moods. Great for people who want to socialize while doing their thing as well.The People - I saved the best for last. When you come to My Awesome Cafe, you get to meet and interact with everyone on the team, including the owners and designers Franck and Bong. They are awesome people. Awesome people working in an awesome cafe, serving awesome food for awesome customers.I stayed in Singapore for a week - my friends were working during the day so I came here the first day after arrival. I came back almost every single day after that, and had an amazing time ! I enjoyed getting to know Franck and the team, listening and sharing our respective life stories.This place is amazing. I will miss coming here. And it is definitely the first place I am hitting up when I am back in town.THANK YOU !LOTS OF LOVE !STAY AWESOME

To say MAC lives up to its name of being Awesome is a complete injustice! MAC ticks all the boxes, surpassing expectations and delighting me every single time i visit. I am literally sent back out into the world with newfound positivity and a happy tummy! (i am not even exaggerating) This weekend i held my boyfriend's 23rd surprise here, and it was PERFECT. From helping to hide his friends and family, to taking out toys and books to entertain the kiddies, to lighting up the cake with sparklers and singing Happy Birthday, this café made everyone feel welcome and at home (and he was VERY surprised) <3<3The food is also out of this world (do yourself a favor and try their PESTO!!), everyone was going CRAZY over the platters. The atmosphere was full of positive energy, where the staff and especially owner and brainchild Franck constantly checked in on us. THANK YOU MAC TEAM FOR AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE!! Definitely my favourite café in Singapore
5
After seeing this place quite a few times passing by ! Finally went there with my friends ! It was nice rustic looking place !Legendary decor pieces ! Food is very good ! The only thinks we did not like it ! There was no water service ! Every time we need to get up to bring our water ! Hope the management will address this issue and implanted it
5
Excellent breakfast atmosphere friendly staff good service good selection and also good selection of beers great location too!
5
Awesome service, awesome deco, awesome ambience, awesome people, awesome food. Indeed an awesome experience overall!
5
Oh well!The service was excellent and the staff there are so Friendly..It such a unique place to hang out there.I'll definitely recommend to my friends and come by again😘😘😘XOXO

Not easy being vegan. and the dishes were flexed to exclude eggplant, capsicum etc. was a decent meal that's really healthy. and was relaxing overall given the ambience, music and chatty staff. open 365.... that's amazing!
3
Good place, nice environment and great neighborhood. I cannot say anything special about the place, frankly speaking, you may find tons of places like that in the city. Nothing negative about it, it is quite an average place. Friendly staff.
5
The minute we walked in, the awesome vibe kicked in! We were greeted with a warm hello and smiles, a very welcome retreat indeed from the wind and rain outside. The interior was hip, cool and welcoming all at the same time. I couldn't stop admiring the details of the unique vintage design. Franck, the owner and who epitomizes awesomeness, came to our table and suggested two different salads and a sausage platter. Better be hungry. They were huge, beautifully presented and everything tasted fresh and flavorsome...each bite brought an "mmmmmmmm" to our lips. Feeling celebratory, we ordered cocktails and were brought very original martinis made of...sour plums! Very original, super tasty and couldn't get enough. We had to order more! Hours later, feeling totally satisfied, refreshed and yes, totally awesome, we left promising ourselves to be sure to return on our next trip to Singapore

I really dont know why this place is so highly rated. Its obviously where all the trendy business people go. Two sandwiches and two coffee for $50 and we were still hungry. They used thick bread and hardly any meat. Seating is also shared so good chance you'll sit with strangers
5
The signboard is not clearly obvious from the street, in fact what greets you are 2 big pillars that means Medicinal Hall rather than a cafe. And an initial browse through the menu seems as though nothing looks gd but every dish that came eventually was extremely delish! The Bacon Platter is a must have! Bacon 3 ways - in a wrap with melty cheese, on toast with melty cheese too and on toast with generous serving of avocado and tomato.The beef lasagna is a little too wet and salty for our liking but the Awesome Salad was absolutely awesome with huge generous servings of everything. I love that the bread is made in house freshly. Portions are huge for Asians, good for sharing! Service is also warm and friendly, they even sang my friend a birthday song, along with a slice of cake that came with a sparkler as candle!
3
loved the ambiance and feel of this place. quirky design and interesting food options. I had a chai latte (which was sadly quite weak and bland) and an upside down pineapple cake (which was AMAZING).they're quite busy so servers aren't super attentive but they are very friendly and accommodating
5
The place is something that you remember. The owner is Italian and he is there on the floor and talking and non stop explaining and helping out. That's a positive and a reason to go. Food here is baked and it's a great thing. A nice menu and some nice wraps for vegetarians also. If this purpose is a casual peaceful no timeline linked outing, this is the place. The milkshakes and coffee is simply worth making the visit
5
This is a quirky fun lively cafe in the heart of the city. It has a great buzz and vibe to it and the staff are great. We didn't eat there but saw the menu which looked good. Sandwiches,salads and snacks looked great.
5
Perfect place for afterwork drinks, farewell, birthday or just a catch up - The staff is really attentive and welcoming ! Food is so good ... Well ... This bar is really AWESOOOOME
4
Clean and nice presantation.The staff was very courteous. The servers are very attentive and brought us coffee and tea very promptly. Staffs there are very friendly! They remember what we want to drink after the first morning.
5
Awesome fantastic service, food and atmosphere. In one word awesome. When in china town and hungry a place to go!
4
this is a chill out coffee place. they do casual drinks too. service is attentive. we love coming here on saturday to hang out.
5
This is the perfect place to catch up with friends for a casual lunch or drink after work. Salads are huge and delicious. Great selection of sandwiches. Affordable wine and good variety.
5
First time that I am writing an English review on tripadvisor but I want that the awesome staff of "My awesome Cafe" understanding this. What does awesomeness mean?If you come for holidays and just spending some days in this big city of singapore and you find a place where you feel at home within one second, this is awesomeness. Because you step into this wonderful place with this amazing people, who build up this all with so much passion and filling this place with so much happiness and love.Beside that the food and drinks are delicious, especially because I love to have some fresh salad and green smoothies. So I have got here a Spirulina smoothie with coconut water which was really great. And the salads are just yummy too.And if you have your cheating day than go for one of the desserts...you wish to have every day your cheating day If you are an awesome person, go there and be a part of this awesomeness!!!Hugs and kissesAlex&Mari

We had lunch here on a Tuesday arriving about 1pm that was clearly a very busy time of the day.A word of warning there is no restaurant name facing the street so it's easy to walk past it.Tables are placed separately but very close to each other, which combined with relatively loud background music means that everyone has to talk quite loudly.We did mention the level of music to the manager who thanked me for the suggestion.Our orders were taken soon after being seated and the meals arrived within 10 minutes; good time considering how busy they appeared to be.The salad was tasty but predominantly varieties of lettuce meaning it wasn't great value; the smoked salmon baguette was very nice
5
I've been there for a quick early lunch with my family and I felt immediately like home healthy food in a cozy atmosphere combined with an excellent service made this quick lunch a great experience :) stuff is very friendly and extremely attentive to the need also of my 18months daughter. Good selection of coffee, healthy drinks, beer and cocktails, make this place suitable for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner and whatever else! Good taste in decoration and interior design thanks to the passion of Bong and Frank! All the best guys and see you soon again ;
5
Friendly staff, good food and great atmosphere. A place you must visit! The owners are there many times, always they make time for a chat and good advises if you want to do things in Singapore. The food is diverse and very nice and healthy. No chicken wings etc on the menu but lots of other very good tasting goods
5
Franck and his team deliver an exceptional experience at My Awesome Café. Even on a crazy busy night, we were well served - service was amazing and drinks arrived quickly. The vibe is great and our entire group (20+) enjoyed themselves.
5
AWESOME place, AWESOME food (mix of Salads / sharing platters with a french flavor), AWESOME Music !
Just AWESOMEEEEE!
5
Awesome lasagna, super awesome crew and atmosphere!!! Cheers! Definitely come back to check out their brunch and coffee yeah!
4
Not many eating places that opens on Saturday morning, as early as 8am around Telok Ayer, thankfully My Awesome Cafe serves a nice breakfast that I really like!
Service is also good. Ate here quite a few times during my bootcamp period.
5
Oh well, what can I say ... Got a very warm welcome by all the bears in the cafe! Hahaha! Never seen a cafe that is so old school yet adorable at the same time! When asked about their bears, I got to know that it was for charity purposes - Children's Cancer Foundation! I hope whoever walk by would drop by to do your part. As usual, received great service from the Awesome team! Well done MY AWESOME CAFE !! Thank yo
5
Great place, great vibe! I used to go to My Awesome Cafe everyday when i didn't had a job & stay there for hours with my laptop.... the staff is so welcoming and you relly feel like home. The food is so delicious (i love the salads), it's clean food & i love it! Also one of the best coffees & smoothie in town! If you never went, you must go
5
We decided to go for a late lunch on Sunday & were delighted to realise that My Awesome Cafe doesn't have those annoying kitchen closures during the middle of the day. It is situated on a very funky street & has "awesome" industrial furnishings. The food is fresh and healthy & quite honestly "awesome". The staff are friendly and helpful & I would encourage you to go there
4
I had a nice experience of having my first time here to have my breakfast.. everything is delicious and all the staff are helpful..They help me what to eat and because it was my First here..,they didn't let me down to try what they offer.. The coffee is nice, the wifi quick, and the bread is freshly baked..Thanks for the great service!!

Heard a lot about this restaurant and did a search on the internet. Visited this place and found out that the food menu is full of text liners. The salmon warp presented was simple and straightforward. Admittedly delicious. Just that one thing I like about this place is it's decors, the revamped old fashion feel with the touch of nostalgic Chinese medicine hall is dark and cozy somehow. Food taste: 3/5Ambience: 4/5Servers: 5/5Cost: 4/
5
Stopped there while walking through Singapore and in need for some fresh and healthy food. A decision I surely did not regret.While the place is a bit hard to find in the middle of other shops, coffees and restaurants - the distinct writing on the pillars in front helps.The menu is a mix of vegetarian and non vegetarian options, all looking healthy and good. Myself, still having half of the day ahead I went for a vegetarian salad , pomegranate juice and a cappuccino.Service was friendly , service was fast and service was good. The part with fast and good did also apply to food and drinks.Prices are not on the cheap side, but it's downtown and you get some healthy , good and quality food for it.If you are vegetarian - don't miss this place. If you just like healthy European like Cousine , same applies
5
Had breakfast at My Awesome Cafe this morning: flat white coffee (perfect) and a back and avocado roll on a baguette (also perfect, the baguette was especially good). It was all as it should be and Franck (the owner) was very hospitable. Recommended.
5
The cafe has a very nice old vintage layout, great atmosphere to have a meal with your loved ones. Waiters are very friendly and helpful towards recommendations and the food quality were superb. Would recommend this cafe to anyone around the area...
3
Much as the food was lovely, fresh and tasty, and as I need to avoid capsicums willing to amend ingredients to suit my diet. The restaurant was just too empty on a Tuesday evening around 8:30 to be enjoyable.
5
My awesome cafe is perfect for healthy lunch, salad are made of fresh ingredients and are huge ! So you won't be hungry after 2 hours. Take my awesome salad, it is the most comprehensive one !
5
Great place and vibe , great for drink s and food , team is as stated awesome ! The place to meet have drinks and fun :-)
Concept is really to be awesome and they deliver , everytime.

We visited here on a busy Sunday morning last week and it took a while to get the menus. The interior is interesting but also very hipster and a bit "trying too hard" / odd as the hot plate is fullfilled with plant waterer etc. so there is no room for the food when it gets ready. I ordered avocado, bacon, cheddar sandwich (16$) with organic lemongrass, ginger & citrus tea (5$) and my husband parma ham sandwich (16$) and cappucino (5$). While waiting to be served we whitnessed more and more customer getting frustrated as they didn't get to pay, were waiting their orders to be taken, picked up the menus themselves and some just leaving when they had had enough of waiting. After good thirty minutes I had my organic tea, which was just a normal teabag in a glass so 5$ price felt kind of too much. My hudbads bread was ok but it only had pesto on one side, huge amount of rocket leaves and one sad slice of ham, so the price was outrageous. To me they brought something with prawns which had nothing to do with the item I had ordered so I had to send it back even I was really hungry. After a while they came to tell me that they are out of bacon so my sandwich can't be made so after waiting for over half an hour (and after seeing how bad the price quality ratio in my husbands sandwich was) I cancelled it. I'm not sure if they quite understand how dangerous it can be to improvise and just bring whatever to the customer with out giving them a heads up as I could have been allergic to seafood.I would give the atmosphere a four and also a four to the service as the owner came to appologize briefly, before we left.
5
My Awesome Cafe is a welcome place to stop for a breather on a hot day, either as a tourist or as a place to enjoy the ambience while getting some work done. The coffee is nice, the wifi quick, and there's powerpoints all over the place. Food's not cheap (you're looking at SGD20 for a sandwich and a cappuccino), but the bread is freshly baked and the ingredients excellent. Decoration tends towards the eccentric; one of the owners has a TV show on 'upcycling', and most of the decorations started life as something else. You'll definitely remember a visit. :
5
Cannot praise the 'My Awesome Cafe' team enough for the catered Event at ArtBlue Studio on Thursday evening. Food and service were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for the team....helping move sofas, sculptures and lending cool stools for extra seating for the formal part of my business event. Everyone commented on the delicious food and reasonable prices. Thanks again 'My Awesome Cafe' for a truly awesome experience!
4
Happy with our orders of My Awesome Vegetarian Salad with Brie, My Awesome Sandwich, and an Acai fix. The salad was a burst of rich flavours; the sandwiches served had variety and character. Highly recommendable
5
I chance upon this cafe as I was walking down Telok Ayer Street in search of a place with good vibes and drinks for my friends and I to hang for the night. The strategic idea of keeping the old clinic's chinese characters caught my eye and I can't help but take a deeper look into the cafe to find it's vibrant use of color & also the vibes that feels just right. Service of staff is great, attentive and it's not really commonly found in SG. So I'm totally digging My Awesome Cafe and their superb service and food! 10/10 will come back for i
4
I've been here with some friends. Love the location and the atmosphere. I ordered one of the salads and it was amazing. My fitness had the lasagna and were equally satisfies. I would definitely recommend it. Good range of food and reasonably priced.
3
I went there couple of times already and everything is good! Wine, food and service but don't expect same level as in s restaurant we go here more for tapas or after work drinks and for the atmosphere!
4
Wandered in for brunch and was not disappointed! The staff were attentive (especially with the owner cracking the whip). Enjoyed the coffee too. Best part were the doggies... I had the pleasure of sitting next to 2 beautiful corgies!
5
Our favorite bar bistro in Singapore, i loved their berries crush, the bacon sandwich and the cold cut platters. Awesome is truly who they are
5
A place where u meet awesome service stuff thamo , Chris, Anwar,Ann, suresh. Good food cold London beer. Must visit place.. for chil out. Cool place... simply love the old school decor...
5
Great service, best food, delicious drinks and a amazing interior/ artconcept!! We actually found this place by walking by and it did us more good as we expected.The staff is very nice and helpful. Espacially the owner Bong, his nickname is Google, maybe because he knows a lot and help in emergencies. So, we needed a doctor and in between 10 min he made us a appointment and brought us by his own to the really awesome and nice doctor. We' re very glad to had this "Guardian Angel" and to found this AWESOME place!Wich was an old chinese hospital. Maybe it was destiny
5
Super chill and relax bar and cafe that serves excellent salads, sandwich, platters and an awesome coconut ice cream. I had their drinkable idea that comes in a lightbulb and you keep it to bring home, i have been using it everyday since we left. The decor is beautiful, the staff is attentive and funny. Our favorite bar, thank you for the awesome tim
5
this bar is truly awesome, they bake their bread and offer excellent platters with free flow of bread. Unlike many places we visited, the service was top notch, ladies even get a hook to hang their handbag. Suresh, Chris and Thamo were superbe hosts. A cafÃ© and bar that deserve a visit, they take the last order at midnight
5
This is an excellent bar by any standards ..and a totally fabulous (un-typical of Singapore?) find. The atmosphere is super-friendly thanks to attentive, friendly and welcoming staff. This was my second visit (had been there two weeks ago) ..Chris, the fabulous co-manager and other staff remembered us. The beer is great - excellent Stella on tap ..and even London Pride ! Plus a great array of cocktails to tempt my teenage daughters.. (Do try the Japanese Mohito ...with Saki...). There is also a wonderful menu ...the sharing platters are FANTASTIC ...no ...AWESOME ! ...freshly baked bread, an array of lovely cheese, parma ham, chorizo... gorgeous rillettes with pesto ... scrumptious. We arrived for Happy Hour and stayed until closing after 1.00 a.m .. We were honoured by the company of Frank (owner) plus the lovely Chong and Roland.. a fabulously happy and entertaining crew. Possibly the friendliest and most truly awesome bar on the planet.
5
Went on a weekday. Ordered a smoked salmon sandwich. Also tried the granola and yoghurt with frozen berries which tasted so creamy, cool and crunchy (thumbs up!). My husband had a salad which he enjoyed. He also took some bread which he only does if he thinks the flour is of a better quality. Only thing 'normal' was the aloe vera juice. Staff were friendly. Great place for a healthy, indulgent hipster breakfast
4
We had brunch here and really enjoyed the big breakfasts that included eggs, your choice of meat or salmon and croissants. Easy to get to from the metro and funky decor.
5
Visited with my sister on our trip to Singapore. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was friendly. Great breakfast and seemed to be one of the few decent places open on a Sunday
4
Good food in an environment with well thought out and attractive decor! Loved to sit outside with an ice coffee in the heat, and the salads are to die for! For Singapore and the quality of food, a reasonable price!
5
Great bunch of guys running the show who are friendly.
Check out the minute details which went into designing the place.
Food: Do not miss their duck platter...
Reasonably priced (good) wine.
4
Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant.
The service was great with attitude. Loved it.
Food was fresh and quick.
Highly recommend
4
Great place! Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Nice food too. Good for a relaxed and casual drink within a cool atmosphere.
4
The awesome salad packed a good punch of duck rillete, tuna, avocado, and more! Very casual ambience, so there wasn't much service (though the manager Suresh was all smiles). Will be back for quick lunch fixes!
5
Went with my girlfriend for couple of drinks and quick dinner. The first approach of the staff is really great and unforgettable! Chris well explained about the food and recommended drinks for us! The food is really fast eventhough they're really crowded and the drinks are awesome like the cafe. Definitely will recommended this awesome café for all! Awesome café with full of awesome staff!Special thanks to Chris and all staff out ther
5
I have read some bad comment/ feedback about this restaurant in Burples so i was curious and like to see what they were complaining about. But to my surprise, it is totally opposite of what i have read. The restaurant turns out to be Unique and the Staff are really attentive. They have even helped me to hung my jacket on a coat hanger. I don't see many restaurant that does that and not to mentioned having hanger in the restaurant in the 1st place!!!!!!!The owner of the restaurant is a really down to earth guy. He is not only the one who curated the menu but also a server when needed to. Very often you will see him walking around checking if everyone is doing ok or asking if the food is to their liking.The food is awesome too! I had the cheese platter which comes with their home made bread and croissant...it is soooooo good. I will definitely go back . Thumbs up !
5
I love their salads, my awesome salad is the best for value and flavour. Can't say no to half an avocado and all the protein! I enjoy their latte more than their cappuccino, which can be a bit on the bitter side for my taste. Nevertheless, I love the laid back atmosphere, decor, and the Aesop products in the restroom are a nice touch :) If you are a regular, they will remember what you like to order and always greet you with a smile
4
I always enjoy coming to this cafe - really nice sandwiches and salads. Lively, a bit quirky, friendly staff. Open for morning coffees and turns into a lively bar in the evenings.
5
A lovely place to go to for coffee, healthy salads and after work drinks served by an excellent service crew! Housed in a preserved shoplot decorated with furniture that takes you back to old Singapore. Totally Instagram-worthy!
5
My Awesome Cafe is chic ,nicely decorate and environment friendly. The best customer service and most delicious with fresh ingredients and a good portion serving for a reasonable price.
Highly recommended a must visit cafe in Singapore 😉.
5
Awesome place thanks to the best advice ever of the owner. He can make you discover new and rare drinks and explain you the story of them. And last but not least the design of the place is amazing and original. You should go there to have a new experience
5
I love this place, not just because of the simple good food and the heartfelt service, the Chines-inspired industrial chic design (what a combination that you have to see it...) is very refreshing. Strongly recommend this venue as chill-out spot, just watch out for the intense CBD launch hours :
4
Nice friendly staff. Good food. Good range of alcohol. Good range of healthy options for the health nuts. All reasonably priced. Great atmosphere (albeit the loudness maybe cos everyone is trying to talk over the music and everyone else). It has a good vintage vibe going one with the old medical hall decor and the classroom like tables
5
It is rare to find this high level or service in a relaxing cafe setting. I was visiting Singapore but took local friends who were really impressed. We called in for lunch but ended up staying all afternoon. Will defiantly be on my itinerary every time I visit Singapor
5
Everybody from the owners to newly hired staff are fantastic, a great mix of real human beings from across the globe who actually cares about you as a customer, always a great place to hang out or grab a quick bite.Great atmosphere - they play music you actually want to listen to, it's airy and cosy.The food is unpretentious, quality ingredients, something for everyone - generally healthy, and good value.The coffee is great, they make interesting cocktails and have a decent wine list...The crowd ranges from the local yoga class ladies, tourists, business drinks to Sunday brunch and family dinner.It's quite addictive really - one of my absolute go-to places, very few have made that list !
5
My Awesome Cafe shines where so many Singapore bars fall short. It manages to balance conviviality with good service and good food with a relaxing atmosphere. Whether you are dropping in to take 30 mins time-out for a coffee or descending with a rabble of friends and colleagues for a session, it always ends in a memorable experience. It exudes a warm European familiarity belying it's location in the centre of Singapore's business district. MAC has become the rock to which i default for an evening out. Most places i'd worry that popularity would change the nature of the experience but i reckon Franck and Bong have the panache to keep it... well, awesome, no matter how busy it gets
5
First visit to a cafe in Singapore and it was definitely an awesome one, just like its name. Ordered a green curry chicken and it was delicious! Since I am a berry lover, I decided to try the berry crush. It was just too good and thirst-quenching since it was a super hot day! It is a must-try for all berry lover! Had their bread butter pudding and it is by far the nicest I have tasted! Needless to say, the service was extremely amazing! The staffs are very friendly and approachable! Also, one of the unique cafes I have ever seen in SG. Interesting concept! Last but not least, they help you take nice photos! Haha! Would definitely visit again! An awesome experience I had! They are really living up to its name! Thank you, My Awesome Cafe! :)One thing that I really love about Awesome Cafe is their service check-back. Never really seen other cafes doing so. *thumbs up
4
Great little hideaway which would be perfect for brunch. He restaurant serves good food, healthy food and beer. Though order a beer and your in for a treat. German beer served almost in steins!
A lovely chilled environment.
5
Super awesome cafe. Great hangout place with awesome customer service esp by Chris and management!
The food is awesome too!
Definitely a place to drop by often!
The green curry chicken is fabulous n the pricing of the menu is super affordable. :)

Everyone get's a warm family welcome from the team at My Awesome Cafe, every day of the week. The excellent healthy selection of food makes the cafe perfect for busy bite in the working week or a more relaxed brunch on the weekend. In the evening the cafe becomes a buzz of great music and friends getting together after a hard day at work always taken care of by the Awesome Team! Why take my word for it.....go and see for yourself
5
Franck's team is impeccable! Always have a smile and ever willing to give suggestions and opinions. The food... well, it really does speak for itself. As I have said before on other comments, it is one of the rare places that as a vegetarian, I do not feel punished for my dietary choice. Kudos to Franck and the team! Keep up the good work!!!The place in itself is inviting and very comfortable... so much so, for a while there it was even the place where i used to do my emails etc away from my office which was on the street behind
5
Once you reached the Cafe, you'll become a part of The Awesome Family. You'll be served a lovely, tasty and healthy food and The Awesome Crew will treat you like an old friend and the best customer at the same time. You will fall in love with this place and will come over and over again
5
As I prepare to leave Singapore after 8 months here. Awesome has been one of the highlights of the stay. Somewhere I could always rely on. Great beers, good food, great decor, fantastic staff...what more can I ask?I'll miss the staff there. Always a smiling welcome, and a handshake/hug. Keep up the good work, and I will see you all in July when I am back.

Interesting interior but not so comfortable. Food can be better with that price range. Staff don't seem very friendly but overall service was still okay. Overall, it was a pleasant visit
3
Place is alright. Food and coffee is pretty decent. Service is good.Girlfriend loved the beef lasagna. In my personal opinion, they should maybe consider redoing their menu. It looks very messy with words all over.
5
Came here for table of 3. Suresh and company took care of us . We ordered too much as it was a late lunch ., but everything was good . The team even did a surprise birthday song for my wife . Awesome indeed!!
5
Excellent customer service and great ambience.. Definitely will come back again for more! Awesome place to hangout with ur loved ones plus with good pricing and the food here is OMG .. Super tasty . Excellent customer service from Crews & the manager Chris, & of cause the bosses .. they are very very friendly and super duper jovial. God bless them all and us. Tc .. plus do visit. Cheers guys
5
A place that lives up to its name! Food is great and the service is EXCELLENT! It's my first visit but definitely not my last! A place suitable for family and friends! Thank you for making my experience an amazing one, My Awesome Cafe!👍👍👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
5
Everything from the food, the staff and the deco are Awesome. The location is easy to find and great hang out place with friends! Food servings are generous and drinks prices reasonable. Yummy vegetarian spread and aromatic coffee!
Two thumbs up!
5
Accidentally stumbled across this hidden gem while last in Singapore. Delicious salads and very helpful guys who own & manage the place. Highly recommended!!!
5
Nice restaurant, lovely decorated, which serves tasty big salads with a lot of vegetables, seeds and dry fruits. Perfect place for a lunch !
3
After trying my awesome cafe I have to say that the good and juices are good. A little pricy but tasty and nice. However at restaurant prices I reckon they could step up with the comfort of the place. Uncomfortable chairs and the semi open concept is unbearable in the mid day su

My Awesome Cafe is a happy, comfortable and lovely place! Franck and his staffs are so helpful in providing us a beautiful set up for our engagement shoot! You guys are truly 一級棒the best of the best! Transformed from a traditional chinese medicinal hall to a cafe Owner Franck Hardy kept the nostalgic atmosphere on the outside but gave the cafe a modern touch on the inside. We need to have our caffeine cravings fixed for the morning so we ordered our favourite drink; the iced latte! My Awesome Cafe is not only awesome in its design and service; they serve awesome coffee and food too! We had very yummy sandwiches to keep our tummy happy!

Great and friendly staff, eager to please made our recent dinner experience here worthwhile. Nice salads and pasta dishes (suggest the beef and chicken lasagnas) with ample proportions make this a place to come back to.The interesting decor consisting of mostly recycled school tables and old doors used as table tops is pretty neat. Fine dining with white table cloths this is not, just a friendly local place to hang out and have a few drinks and a delicious bite.

With roughly 24 hours in Singapore I attempted to see as much as possible and all by walking. But even in November it was very hot and while I was in the area, looking for a place to sit down, relax, rest my legs and feet and drink something cool, I decided to have a drink here (it was too hot for me to even think about food yet). After walking up and that part of the street two times, unable to decide. I'm happy I chose this cafe. The staff was super friendly, and easy to communicate with. I forgot what drink I ordered, but I remember that it was red, fruity, refreshing and not too sweet. I was reading a book and the staff quietly exchanged the empty cup for a glass of cool water.Next time I'm in town again I'll stop by in the evening to see the decorations and small lights all lit up.Next time

In my opinion, it is truly what the name says. Lovers of good food, fine dining and vintage, do check this cafe! Situated at the previous 中华医院, 中医师公会主办, a 1956 of shophouse of Singapore Heritage.Once i step into the restaurant, my eyes are busy wondering and looking at all the interesting vintage collection everywhere.The dining tables are beautifully upcycled from old-school school tables and there are industrial-look ceiling lamps. Do you see a reservation-stand converted from land-surveyor instrument (without the legs). Yes, it is the one at the bottom right-hand side. Amazing!The food is delicious indeed. I had Lasagna (top left) whuch is very satisfying in terms of portion and taste. I simply love the tender minced beef and the flavourful cheesy pasta. All in the right portion and I think I would have clean up the whole plate to the last drop if not for proper dining etiquette. Hahahaha! And Duck Leg Comfit and it is smooth & succulent. I can see Mike enjoyed it very much. I asked him and he gave two thumbs up for it! Congratulations, MyAwesomeCafe!

The name says it all. How incredible a name can be carried out so well. We went to my Awesome Cafe for a quick salad on our way to visit Telok Ayer's rich temples, and we were so blown away that we decided to come back for dinner, to get more awesomeness, as they say.Well, both of our experiences were totally amazing.Excellent platters to share (cheese, cold cut, and many more), French bread freshly baked on the premise, a team of 5 star hoteliers behind this venture, fresh and excellent food, a deco that brings you back in time, what else would you expect from a place called my Awesome Cafe? Do pay a visit to their toilet too, as the Aesop soap will leave a long lasting smell on you also

Interesting menu with well cooked food. Nothing fancy but works for a quick dinner. Tried the duck confit on bread together with a duck leg. Good service and friendly staff.
5
This cafe is one of the best experiences I've got during my stay in Singapore. The atmosphere of this place is very unique for Singapore. It's very friendly, warm, unpretentious yet really awesome, that attracts a great mix of very different people. The abundance of hanging industrial light bulbs, huge salads and amazingly delicious French cheese, cheerful and nimble waiters and above all that awesomeness very decent prices made me come back again and again
5
We stumbled upon this little café on our first evening in Singapore. It was late and it seemed as if it was about to close but they welcomed us in, and could not be more friendly. Suresh, one of the owners started chatting to us. He was so welcoming and friendly, and spoke about Singapore with the same passion he has for his café and life. We loved it so much we went back every day of or stay in Singapore, and every day got a warm welcome, good coffee and good food. Suresh advised us of other places to eat and best places to visit. Good wholesome food with great atmosphere. A must visi
5
Having lunch and although it was packed and waiters where extremely busy, we had the biggest smile and an excellent service. Good food, even healthy proteine shakes, The place has an industrial concept and is down to earth. Many hipsters, locals and business people, realy a great mix. In the evening they turn the restaurant into a hip bar where you can hang out as well
3
The unique look of this cafe is the reason attract me here. We tried the coffee and famous desserts. Both average, it won't make me feel like coming back again as there are so many cafe around Singapore. I have not try the food yet, which i heard the cafe offer good brunch
4
I ordered the Duck Leg Confit, My Awesome Sandwich and Mixed Berry drinks.Pros :+ Duck Leg Confit as well as Duck Rillettes are AWESOME+ Mixed Berry drinks, it's a bit too thick for my taste then again maybe it's a good thing because they don't watered down at all.+ Price is affordable for french cuisinesCons :+ Being "Providing Healthy Food" is part of their motto, one hardly find high carbohydrate here, so if you are feeling really hungry, one should keep that in mind.(Then again one probably shouldn't eat too much carbs LOL)Suggestion for the owner :+ It's lucky for me that there's a picture of the entrance in the trip advisor.Otherwise people with no clue, will find it's hard to find the location, even myself had my doubt reading "Medical Center" plaque infront of the cafe.In my opinion it will be handy to have a signage written in English
4
We popped in here recently for a western style breakfast of croissants with scrambled eggs, ham and avocado (the only thing really on offer for breakfast with some mild variations). There were lovely shakes/ smoothies on offer, some with protein and our breakfast was fresh and healthy. We had a great waitress from the UK who served us and gave us some tips on where to go while we were in town. A very chilled place to stop in. Do be mindful that prices exclude GST and service charges, which added a fair chunk to our bill.
5
Well, where to start? The deco? The people? The food? The istagram-friendly corners? The up-cyled stuff? The recycled ideas?Everything is worth mentioning and admiring at this cafe, that turns into a bar in the evening.We visited it 3 times during our stay at the Amoy Hotel nearby, and we have never been disappointed, we in fact made new friends with the staff and the owner.Truly, the food is fresh, very good, the service is impeccable (like in a 5 star hotel), the ambience is super cosy, the deco is stunning and brings you back in your childhood days, the recycled and up-cycled objects throughout the cafe, from the entrance to the toilet, are the fruit of an admirable work and passion!We decided to link them up with a friend as I think they deserve to come to the USA to expand, that's how much we love this awesome cafe
4
Great coffee and shakes, great service, and a healthy menu, but mostly a well run space to sit and chill with friends or a laptop any time of day. And they serve draft beer and other drinks. Friday nights can be particularly awesome. Open 365 days per year, so very useful for breakfast, lunch, or dinner on those many religious festivals and public holidays
5
I go to this place very often for lunch or dinner because it is close to my office. I felt in love the first time I dropped by. Venue is casual and confortable for an afterwork beer. But do not miss the great food. Healthy/vegetarian options available and very nice ingredients. The salads are not boring and balanced dressings make them very tasty. In addition, you have many other options to choose among. Yesterday, I tried the duck leg and was yummy, but I have also tried the yummy lasagna, chicken breast, salmon and sandwiches.However, one of the things I enjoy the most after work are the cold cut platters, which come with a delicious bread, surpisingly, something difficult to find in Singapore restaurants. You can share them with your friends or just order one for you, together with a glass of wine and enjoy the food, the nice music and the atmosphere.Special mention to the staff: always happy and friendly. They will make you feel like at home
5
awsome cafe, unique design and offers good healthy selection of food -try the aqai berries. also good wine and beer selection. free wifi
5
Delicious latte, excellent service and querky decor. A great place to stop while touring China Town, Singapore.
5
We stopped here to shelter from the rain. The service was friendly and we had a very interesting berry drink that got us ready for the continuation of our walk through Chinatown
5
Aside from the the good food and friendly people. I am so pleased today that the owner found and returned my lost wedding ring @ the cafe! I wish that your business will prosper and will always be on top of the list By the way if you will ask me what's my favorite? CHILI CON CARNE and lots of cheese please
5
I always feel welcome and at home when at the Awesome Cafe - the friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere can brighten even the most awful stressful day. This is my definitely my goto place for some cheery smiles and great food - just like visiting an old friend
4
this resturant is very good. we just went there for drinks and we hade a look at the menue and it was great. the food is good and so are the drinks the service is amazing and the food is a little above avarge on the price
5
We simply fell in love with this cafe the moment we saw it as the retro deco is tastefully done. The wordings on one of the walls that end with the sentence, "We bring out the awesomeness in each other" aptly describe how you feel when you step into the cafe.The brownie and the Awesome sandwich were tasty and the staff were very friendly.This is definitely one place to come for a drink and food when you are in the Amoy Street/Tanjong Pagar area. We shall be back
5
Stumbled in one of those days and have returned on a weekly basis since! The cool and friendly people who work there paired with outstanding food and drink options make this place well worth its name! But most importantly, being recognised and welcomed like a member of the family is the reason to call this a true home away from home
4
First visit and I fall in love with the food. I enjoyed the duck confit, glazed ham sandwiches and healthy salad. Awesome food. Service staff was great but I guess service staff should look away when customers are getting cash from the wallet. Overall great food and I will return.
4
Tucked within a conserved old shophouse still bearing the name of Chung Hwa Free Clinic, this joint offers good fusion food. Decor is quaint with old school desks modified as tables and lots of old knick knack items like teapots, cupboards, etc, etc. They served Awesome Salads, awesome sandwiches and these are pretty large servings. Staff are friendly but place is dim, cluttered and noisy especially during peak lunch hours! Also, it is open - no doors to cut out the external noises! A nice place if you can bear the din
5
Tasty food, great service and some character.
Perfectly in the vibe of telok ayer, we want more of these places.
5
Really love this cafe.. it's great for a business meeting or lunch with friends.
Beautiful old style building and decor, and delicious salads and fresh juices. Go for the Awesome salad, it won't disappoint.
5
Great chilled bar, perfect for a fun night out with friends. Kudos to the owner for creating a wonderful, comfortable space with cool and funky decor. Recommend the wraps for a light bite.
5
Great location, cool cafe that transforms into a bar in the evening with amazing platters to share. The interior design is amazing too. Staff is excellent
5
F&B and service were truly awesome. Frank was very clear about the plan for the gathering in advance which made the evening go smooth. The staff were excellent as always. We were a decent sized group, everything was tracked very well and in the end the billing was smooth. I would definitely host my next gathering also at My Awesome
5
This café has the best staff, warm welcomes, great stories and lovely goodbyes. The food here is different from any other "popular" café food, it doesn't end with you feeling guilty about what you have eaten but the fresh, well thought out dishes makes the experience such a refreshing and nutritious one. Rest assured that the ingredients used come from the best possible sources (France, Norway, Australia, Tiong Bahru market)!
5
This place came as a compromise between a vegan friends and some others. The ambience is great and food is terrific.The owner is a megavolt character who loves what he does. and it shows.If you are looking for a meeting spot in the CBD, this is it
5
After eating at My Awesome Cafe a few months back I cannot get enough of this place. I have had bushiness lunches here and also attended a friends 40th birthday celebration which was a great success. Only last night I organised for group booking for 35 of my working team to celebrate our end of year gathering at the Cafe and it was, without doubt, one of the best team events we have had in the past 7 years. We had platters of cold cuts, wonderful baked breads a selection and red and white wine, tap beers, and also healthy drinks of a non alcoholic nature. The food was excellent. Everybody raved this morning when we arrived at the office. I cannot recommend My Awesome Cafe enough to friends and colleagues, If you haven't been here yet - make a visit quick smart. Highly recommended
5
A night to remember the service is excellent the team are friendly and informative..the atmosphere is so cool and just buzzes with energy…the food is exceptional, super fresh and well presented..If you are visiting Singapore or live there you must put My Awesome Cafe on your must do list, visit and enjoy a great dining experience with your friends …prices are also surprisingly reasonable…love this place have recommended to my friends I will be back next trip to Singapore…
4
I was there with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. I had a baguette with avocado, humus, eggplant and salad. It was very good. As a desert I had the coconut ice cream with espresso. That was not very special. Nice ambiance. Little bit industrial. The only negative is that sitting is not very comfortable because they only have barstools
5
Definitely gonna recommend this place, I like the concept and the duck platter was awesome. Very generous with the portion. Great place.
5
This place was recommended by a friend and I was very impressed with the selection and the quality of the food. Great environment as well and a hip new place for after hours and happy hour as well.
5
I love this place! Especially the French yogurt with frozen berries and granola that they serve. That said, their platter is excellent for sharing, you will not regret ordering this (comes with bread, salami and whatnot) - I like how they are not stingy with their servings too. It's a great place to wind down after work. Their staff are an energetic bunch. Very affordable spot
5
I absolutely love this place! Comfort food, gorgeous tasty salads you can custom, try their croissants! Absolutely Awesome people, it doesn't feel they are working there but rather are welcoming you to their home. No frills, lots of fun and a profond respect to the local culture they are preserving while making their own. Perfect place to visit any time of the day, for a coffee-croissant in the morning, off site office in the day or easy going bar for an after work drink...don't make other plans when you visit as you won't feel like living this place once you get there
4
Stopped in for breakfast before heading out into Singapore for the day.The atmosphere is great, very industrial-chic, in a good location. The staff were friendly and helpful.Had the awesome sandwich, which was tasty. It's 4 quarters with different toping on each - I couldn't have Salmon so they happily switched it for the Thai Beef, which was good. The coffees are a decent size - not the best coffee in the world, but reasonable.Would definitely recommend
5
I'm a regular at My Awesome Cafe - mainly at lunch times and for after work wine and nibbles. We've also held parties here! The staff are always welcoming and service is just awesome. The food is good, with a great mix on the menu for those wanting something healthy, those who don't, and they have good portion sizes too. I'd recommend the salads! Love the atmosphere of the place, fun while being chilled, and really very welcoming. I never hesitate to recommend it
5
We stop over in Singapore on our way to France. We came across My awesome Cafe as it was recommended by some friends, and we weren't disappointed, as soon as I entered this place, I was impressed by the architecture and great atmosphere, I loved the industrial recycled and repurposed style of this awesome cafe, I felt home the food was great and the staff made us feel extremely welcome! I highly recommend this place, is truly awesome
5
One of the most friendly places in Singapore in a monument building.Not only are the owners charming and professional, all their staff is awe-some!! Perfect place for a brunch, a lunchtime salad or a drink at night with a cheese and cold cuts platter (they have excellent whiskies too!)South-West of France meets Singapore, and it is a huge success!Cheers guy
5
I first stepped into MyAwesomeCafe in July last year on the strength of a great review from a blog on my cafe hunting trail over a 2 week period. The thing that initially impressed me was the uniqueness of the interior design and its location in an old shophouse - just like the places I used to visit when I was a child in the 80s - bringing up memories of those carefree days when I would wander around peering through old glass cabinets filled with a myriad of different niknaks.It is a sympathetic and unique revival of the old retro Singapore, updated to reflect a nostalgic mood but retaining much of its old character and spirit.Initially arriving in the quieter mid afternoon hours, I had the luck to spend time chatting with the owners and staff working there, and came away with really good vibes. I have mainly had drinks and snacks over some great chats with friends and family so would definitely recommend MyAwesomeCafe for those awesome catch ups with those that matter to you. The service and surroundings are warm, hip and relaxed - I have been back many times since whenever I swing back to Singapore
5
Unabashedly, I have been very opened about my love for My Awesome Cafe. It's been my magical go-to place whenever I need a quick fix of happiness in the midst of a stressful work day. The cafe lives to its name because every staff there display that level of awesomeness that flows through from the way they serve their customers to the details and preferences about the regular customers that they always make a point to remember. Then there is the food. I am unabashedly opened about my health and fitness lifestyle so I am often at the cafe for a healthy serving of an Awesome Salad. And yet if I am allowed a little indulgence, I would head back to the cafe for my "cheat day special", the Pineapple Upsidedown Cake as well as the Spring Onion Loaf. Every dish at the cafe is lovingly prepared with only the freshest ingredients. Every bite brings on the awesome. Apart from the food and the folks, he team at My Awesome Cafe has preserved a bit of historical Singapore through the decor and the way they Upcycle old stuff from years past that even my Mom approved when I brought her there for a meal. The cafe and its awesome team are like family to me. If you need to inject a semblance of awesomeness back into your life, pay this magical place a visit
5
Great place with nice details and simple elements.
Good for a beer and snack after work or in between, food is good, beer is cold and enough fans are in place.
4
Have had a few business meetings here recently and happy to say I've found a gem in this busy area. The service is excellent, salads are good quality, and the price reasonable. I'll be back!
5
Great service, people and atmosphere!
They really care if you feel good:
arrived there when kitchen was already closed but did get huge sandwich made by waiter as I was hungry:)
5
This bar deserves its name. Great drinks, great food, awesome people! One of the best place to have a drink or grab a bite after work, in one of the nicest street of SIngapore.
5
MAC as it is affectionally known is a certainly a favourite... if there is a place where one feels at home whereby the energy is uplifting yet chilled, this is it! And also to be able to enjoy great simple great food and desserts is a good plus!All this stems from the hardworking and contagious energy of its owner, Franck and his staff who are there to greet you, serve you or really just to have a chat over coffee... gets busy during lunchtime (as to be expected) so if you have the leisure of time, go check it out after.The design of this place, with its "recycled" materials and use of old bits and bobs as decorative art is inspiring and also certainly worth a mention!A must visit for both near and far... and if you meet Franck, say hi for me please... :
5
I went there with 6 other friends on a Friday night. It was crowded but the staff managed to find us a table.Very nice charcuterie and cheese platters!Great cocktails as well(I chose the one with Aloe Vera..super tasty!)The staff and the manager were very friendly and always there to help.Thanks for this night. I will definitely come back again
5
Ok. Funky hipster name. Loudmouth expat Hooray Henries littering the pavement loudly beefing up and boring with their latest financial conquests. Loud but catchy music. Inside. Plastic stools. Polished concrete. And probably the best meal I've had in Singapore. Duck leg and salad. So moist, tender and tasty. Tangy salad dressing with duck pate on sordough toast. Yum. Absolutely yum
5
Really like everything about this cafe/bar. A nice vibe during the day, with great food and coffee; in the evenings still great good, but a bit livelier! We come here quite a bit.Food is a mix of croissant, sandwiches, salads and main courses. Service is always friendly too! It's in a lovely part of town as well! Between Tanjong Pagar Mrt and Telok Ayer Mrt. Well worth a visit
5
Very cute cafe on Telok Ayer set in an old pharmacy. It's a great mix of old Singapore charm and modern decor. The restaurant has an open concept but still nice and cool inside. The menu is big with a lot of things I want to try and reasonably priced - huge selection of salads and sandwiches on freshly baked bread and lots of drink options. Would have liked the portion to be a tiny bit bigger! The service was great. Staff are very attention and it seems most of them are western which is quite unusual in Singapore? Will definitely be back again. Next time would like to try a coffee
5
Came to this cafe i usually frequent and felt guilty of not writing any review. So here we go. The cafe is located along Telok Ayer Road with the original facade of a Chinese Medical clinic. With its original white huge pillar of Chinese characters grertings its guests. Inside the cafe, the owner uses alot of recycled materials to bring it to life. Staffs are friendly and professional. The owner, Mr Frank is one cool guy. Coffee was good and the signature "My Awesome Salad" was generous.This is a place for me to unwind definitely.
5
Try it out guys, you will not regret it, a must try in Singapore. Awesome as it name says. If you are around Telok Ayer, go for it
4
My Awesome Café is so awesome, how can we not be one of the first to review this awesome café?Ok, jokes aside, the Chinese-y shopfront might fool passer-bys into thinking that it is a Chinese medicinal shop. Upon closer inspection, it is anything but. Expertly placed assorted knick-knacks and lit with rainbow-coloured lantern lamps, My Awesome Café's eclectic factor ranks high.Food-wise, the Chicken Lasagna didn't quite hit the spot as the portion was a tad too small. Try the Organic Watermelon Juice for a refreshing drink or the Awesome Coconut Ice Cream - great for cooling down in Singapore's hot weather.Choose from a couple of square tables or opt for a high table-top to do your work. Almost every table has a power socket close by and their Wi-Fi signal is pretty strong. Our planned 2 hour stint turned into a 5 hour affair! It can get pretty quiet on a Sunday night, given that the surrounding areas are office buildings, but hey we are not complaining! A great spot for work or for a chill night out with buddies
4
Decided to visit this cafe after looking at the various reviews by many people. My experience here was not good - chicken lasagna and salmon sandwich was good. Ambience was good and cafe exterior was extremely cool.
5
Guys, I was invited to a friend's birthday party last Friday, and I promised myself to write a review of this place.The name, quite quirky, does not describe this place enough!The selection of canapés served during the birthday, the cheese display (OMG, air flown from France and Spain, mainly goat cheese), the cakes, the cold soup, were all delicious. The deco. Franckly speaking, the best chill out interior design ever created on earth. Down to earth, west meets east, chic industrial, a vibe created in an old hospital that truly deserves the attention of not only Singaporean clients but travelers looking for ideas for their home.Every single corner of this cafe, that turns into a hipster bar restaurant in the evening, is an Instagram friendly delight.The drinks are very reasonable, a bottle of French wine at $37 during their happy hour is a steal in this little island.All in all, a top 5 star experience delivered by 5 star hoteliers that quit their hotel jobs to open this venture.My hats off guys.You are AWESOME.Thank you for one of the best night out in Singapore. Truly memorable
5
WOW, this is such a cool discovery. My Awesome Cafe, a name that is hard to carry, but they carry it very well indeed. We passed by while visiting Telok Ayer for its famous temples, and we discovered a hidden gem that is worth the stop.We were attracted by the shophouse because it is a conserved building as it was once the Chung Hua Free Clinic, since 1952.A Frenchman has converted it into a cafe, that is a bakery in the morning, a bistro at lunchtime and a bar restaurant in the evening.We loved it at lunchtime so we decided to go and spend our last evening there, before we flew away.The place was packed for lunch, and was also, to our surprise, packed for dinnertime.A small birthday party was happening, and the staff sang very loud the happy birthday song Kevin. We knew we were in for a fun night.We shared a few cold cut platters, and My awesome salad, and gosh, this was spectacular, fresh, a free flow of cripsy and warm bread, super good drinks and ice cream (we took the coconut ice cream with a coffee liquor, a delight).We spent 6 hours there when we came for an hour originally, we has a fab night at my awesome cafe on our last night there. Beautiful, thank you
5
A super cool cafe that turns bar in the evening: Loved their cold cut platters, cheese platters, their bread is absolutely the best as it comes freshly baked; crispy and warm.A delightful restaurant and bar that some people may have misunderstood for a cafe serving eggs.Go there for their great coffees, comprehensive beer and wine menu to enjoy yourself to the max.An outstanding cafe with an excellent 5 star hotel service
5
Blown away by the great food and service. Had a croissant with avocado and brie. The avocado was soft and fresh. You can tell that pride is taken in making the food here. Coffee was perfect too. Whats even more unique is the site of this cafe, it is located on a heritage site and was free clinic in the 1950's. The service here was great too, rare sometimes in Singapore. Both Jessica and Ryan served from their hearts. Thank you
4
I love it when old heritage spaces are given new leases of life in a cool sort of way. So when I chance upon this interesting find while exploring with my team in Singapore, you can help but whip out the phone and instagram it!The shop use to be a clinic called Chung Hwa (The even kept the original signboard!) and is located on a street in Telok Ayer Street, just a stone away from Amoy Hotel (which is another heritage site given a new lease of life).The cafe is certainly an art nouvo food fusion of East and West, but seriously what do I know about art? It’s just a great place you’ll no doubt spend instagrammaing in between coffee sips
5
If you love healthy options and people with lots of heart, you're gonna love this place. It's got a casual and welcoming vibe. Unpretentious. And it's reflected in both the menu and the service staff.The two owners are always on hand to welcome and give great recommendations. I'd recommend this place for the menu alone, but you can't help but fall in love with everything about this place especially the people.Loads of vegetarian options and great juices. Even protein shakes! I can't fish about this place any more. Just get down there. Check my photos to see how great the food looks
4
We came across this cafe while sightseeing on Telok Ayer Street. Initially we went in for a cooling drink. The decor is industrial, apart from the great lights, the seating metal stools which is not normally to my taste. However my cocktail of black currant vodka, mint etc and my husband's cold beer convinced us to have a salad for lunch. They were delicious - he ingredients were fresh and the salad beautifully presented. In a part of the world where such dishes are hard to come by this is well worth a visit
5
We passed by on our way back home, and were attracted by the crowd and the design. Their board showed "Awesome Time" bottle of wine at $35 so we decided to have one last drink. And I am so glad we did.I read the reviews online now, and I have to say that My awesome cafe (now I know, but when I passed by, I only saw the clinic name outside) is a super cool bar.We chatted with 2 of the staff, both from the hotel industry, and we had a superb time there.We even ate their cold cut platters after a previous dinner, and I have no regret.Check out their toilet as Aesop soap is ready to be pressed.Loved i
5
It's rare to find a place in Singapore where you can just Be (totally unpretentiously just Be). You can choose to spend quality time alone, reading a nice book or getting inspired or having a cool catch up with close friends, either quietly or super loudly. You can do it all at My Awesome Cafe, a place that was stunningly transformed from an abandoned first TCM Hospital in Singapore. The food selection here is simple yet authentic, fresh and priced that will keep your wallet smiling. Service amongst the staffs is...awesome? Yah, they embrace you like a friend coming home. One of the best things you will really love about this place is the vibe, somehow, you can feel a genuine happy feeling, just by listening to vibrant catch ups. You are probably already aware of their iconic birthday celebration song singing that will wake up the entire Telok Ayer street. If you have that sparkles for life and the joy within, think of how awesome you'll feel when you visit this second home
4
Enjoyed my solo visit here, the atmosphere of the little cafe in the old shop-houses of Telok Ayer St makes this place well worth a visit. I only had coffee and fruit but from the look of some of the tasty looking salads being bought out for other customers I'll be going back soon to try some of those!!
5
Incedible cafe that transforms into a bar in the evening, still serving the same menu all day long. The cold cut platters are the best in Singapore, super fesh products and I hear they bake their bread 7 times day. The bread was delicious, we went there at 8pm and it was cripsy and warm, with an excellent taste, reminding us of the bread you find in France. We and a few bottles of Prosseco during their happy hour (I think it is 3pm to 9pm), and the best touch was that they extended the happy hour price for us. All in all a top mark for this little gem for food, service, price and the attitude of the staff. Keep it up
5
Have been here twice before for coffees and drinks and thought the casual food menu looked interesting. So eventually decided to try on Boxing Day and are we glad we did. We got a great value bottle of cab sauv for $35 !!! Am I still in Singapore I thought ? But the real surprise came when we ordered the salad and meat/cheese platter , which is so good I thought I was in France or Italy. In 6 years this is the best platter we have had in Singapore and the bread was so fresh. We asked about the bread and it turns out they bake their own 7 times per day on premise. My wife is half Italian and pretty fussy with food but this has now made our shortlist of places we frequent regularly and this is not a big list. Oh and the ambience and service on Boxing Day were first class. Great place in telok Ayer and we will be back
5
Great ambience, genuine and extremely warm service. Cafe started by owners previously from Hospitality so little wonder where they got their top marks service. Nice lunch venue to get a break from the four walls and fill the growling tummy with yummy salad
4
Designed a la a vintage Chinese medical hall literally, this place gave me the chills at first. I don't know why - but I did some reading up on it (including reviews), and realized it was a pretty cool place.Furnished with school desks, workbenches and other interesting ornaments strewn around the cafe, this place had a class of its own literally. Plus the dim interior with its red lighting, one tends to feel they've been tossed back in time literally, if it a morbid sense.My Awesome Salad (SGD$15.00) came - complete with greens, smoked salmon, herb chicken brease, duck rillettes, avocado and tomato; and a slice of bread spread with avocado paste. I added Brie Cheesefor SGD$4.00.Well, how shall I describe the salad other than "awesome"? The smoked salmon was springy and not overly salted; the herbs chicken breast were very finely sliced and tender, and the vegetables were fresh. Half an avocado was simply delightful, because I love avocadoes. The duck rillette was very tasty too- somehow it tasted like minced luncheon meat in my opinion. I love luncheon meat, so the rillette definitely won me over as well.For drinks, I had the Chocolate with Mixed Berries and Milk Iced Protein Shake (SGD$10.00) - whoa, pricey for an non-alcoholic drink! The drink was thick and creamy, a lovely blend of chocolate and berries. There were real berries found within the delicious concoction as well.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/lunch-at-my-awesome-cafe.htm

We stopped here for a few beers on our way to dinner, I'd never had Tuatara lager before which was very tasty, and admired the lizardness of the bottle - most intriguing. Tuatara pilsner is just as good too :-

I was on my way to Chinatown and needed food and to escape some pending rain so I stopped in. I thought the food was a little bit expensive, but it was a great lunch. The meal had a very light European feel to it. I had the ham sandwich which was served open face on baguette with a piece of very good ham on each slice of bread. The side salad was very nice and the yogurt & granola with pin alp slices seemed odd, but really was a nice side / ending to the meal. I had a great cup of tea as well.If I would have realized how close I was to Chinatown, I might have passed this place up for some cheaper fare, but I'm glad that I didn't

I stumbled upon this place today alog Telok Ayer Street. A great addition to the F&B scene there, seeming to cater to breakfast brunch, afternoon tea, drinks or dinner, all with great people watching, civilised chilled vibe and affordable prices. Well worth a visit...

this is one of these brunch/coffee/hangout restaurants that are getting popular in Singapore. simple is the theme: menu, decoration, comfort food...I ended up eating a salad and a berry juice. overall everything is good but then nothing unique, social it extraordinary; and fir that I find it expensive.if you are in the area, nothing can go wrong. yeah, that's it..

Guys, this place rocks.We went there yesterday , Friday, it was packed with happy customers and a mood you don't want to leave, happy!I am still in shock of discovering a place like this here in Singapore.Super fresh salads and bread, incredible interior design, we met Bong, the designer, through the owner Franck, and his stories could not stop.We are in love with this cafe, meaningful to us for more than food, deco and ambience, we just felt honoured to meet genuine and passionate owners

We had a salmon salad and bread with ham and scramble eggs, coffee and raw ginger tea (hot water + ginger slice) which cost almost SGD40 for a brunch. Is a lifestyle cafe but certainly not a place for food. The cafe highlighted the Chinese word engraving on the column, which shows it is a clinic in the past. My personal opinion think it is a poor concept for a coffee place

I love the decor and ambience of the cafe, its very down to earth and fun. The time i was there, we saw a little birds nest with quail eggs in one of the plants hanging off the wall. The old herbal tea container that was used for "take yourself" water was a great idea and the hanging light bulbs lamps was very unique.I had the awesome salad which was generous in portion, not just a mountain of greens but a whole avocado, salmon etc. Not huge but just nice for lunch. Will be back to try the rest and just enjoy the ambience. Maybe ice kachang using the old hand cranked ice kachang machine sitting in the back room? Service was really easy going yet professional

Having been a bread person & being in Asia for 6 years now, never had my husband appreciated any sort of bread this much in Asia until he made his first encounter with the hard bread My Awesome Cafe uses to make sandwiches - to the extent that we HAVE TO go to this cafe almost every Sunday! For me I like the mixed berry yogurt, chocolate au pain, and the very fresh orange juice ;-

To be honest, I passed by this cafe several times recently but I entered only today, as I wasn't sure if it was opened or still setting up. It's hard to put a style on this place, hipster probably fits best, a bit indus, a bit exotic and definitely different. I really liked the cool jazzy music that wasn't too loud and kept the place quiet enough for a lunch break.The service could be more friendly, but it was efficient.I ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice and the Awesome vegetarian salad. The juice came very quickly and was really nice.The salad was impressive. Huge, fresh, full of flavours but nothing too strong. It wasn't soaked in dressing, just the right amount.I liked : the atmosphere and food.I liked less : a bit pricey, but quantities were big. Would be better if GST and service included because more than 20sgd for salad and juice is a a lot

This place is distinctively hipster. From the retro decor to the vintage school desks, bullet magazine case, to the scrapped firehose pipes pipes and exposed bulbs.But before you dismiss this as yet another place jumping on the hipster bandwagon based purely on its looks. You should try the food.My wife had the Awesome Salad and it was fillied with generous portions of mesclun salad with smoked salmon, herbed chicken breast, duck rillettes, avocado and tomatoes. BURP!I had the Duck Rillettes Sandwich which had slices of baguettes smeared with delectable shredded and pulled strips of duck. Divine.They have a Happy Hour promotion which runs tills 8pm, with a bottle of wine at just $35. Not too shabby I say. It certainly kept me and the missus happily imbibed

We were here by May 2014. We were attracted by its special front door signboard 中华医院. This shop previous is a Chinese hospital and now change to cafe. To me the food is salad, sandwich that is very healthy. But it's quite high price for a Malaysian like me haha... Anyway, I just want to come for once only so it is acceptable. The food ingredient eg vegetable are very fresh. Atmosphere is relaxing during lazy Sunday morning.
