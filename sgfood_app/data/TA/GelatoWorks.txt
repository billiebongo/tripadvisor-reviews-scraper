Great gelato and right next to my hotel. And on a hot day after a burning spicy Thai meal, a cool and creamy gelato hit the spot. Go here and enjoy!

Not being negative, but this ice cream was a little bland, clean polite and enthusiastic, but over priced for the quality of the product

The chillout weekday says, this is a chillout place. Hot afternoon. Tonnes of work on your office. Bad bosses. Yucky lunch. All you need is love and some ice cream. And then you stumble upon a place you didn't know existed for the last 6 months (that's what she says). I need attention. And that's what she gave. I tried like 10 flavors. No joke, my bosses are that bad. And finally went for Passionfruit. Yes, sweet loving passion or the lack of it. The texture is savory. The flavor is good. It made me smile. A chillout place indeed. So the chillout weekday says, I'm coming back for more
