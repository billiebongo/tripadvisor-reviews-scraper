I have been to a restaurant with a similar name in Mumbai and decided to check out the one in Singapore as well. They have some nice indian food focusing on seafood. The pricing is a little high and service can be better.

Came here for lunch with some colleagues. Quite a tasty selection of seafood options as well as various other regular curries. Quite spicy but still tasty. Service was efficient. Average pricing for this type of food.

Ambience is simple.
Service is adequate.
Food is very good.
Recommended. Fish, crab, and chicken are all very good.

Great food, especially the green chili crab and just as good service. The naan was one of the best I have eaten. Loved the lamb dum Bryani. Wished I had ordered the fish too. Definitely will return soon..

We accidently discovered Hajalee at Singapure. We were on site seeing near Singapore flyer & Merlin. When we saw the name Gajalrr,i remembered the great seafood i had in Parle . We ordered Chilly crah with Yanddor roti& rice for two of us being non vegetarian & akra sabzi & dal for vegetarians. After some time waiter brought tools to breakcrab along with special apron,we had to request him to get crab without bones. It did take time but when food came,it was amazing. Succulant crab meat in green gravy- not to spicy or hot but very tasty. Our vegetarian friends also enjoyed preparations. Everything was authentic.Decor is not great but service is friendly. Though ot is slightly on expensive side,it is value for mone

I was out with a friend for dinner and we ordered Bombil Fry, Prawns curry and Clams Sukka. The taste was just awesome, had the same feeling as eating in Mumbai.We had also ordered the caramel custard and the sweet was just right.Highly recommended!

Visited the restaurant second time during Jan 17 with family and friends, had too bad experience.We ordered starters and later ordered main course. Main course reached the table, all starters were not served. The waiter looks to have not ordered in the kitchen.Waiting time is too much; too price; no value for money; quite disappointed. 400+ SGD was bill size for 5

Visited Gajalee recently the food was average. Had the fish curry, sol kadi, chicken curry and veggie thali and the food was disappointing. The one in Mumbai is far better.The cost of this place is much more cheaper than before but the quality too has come down with it

For people who know Goa in India and had loved sea food there, this is the place to rejuvenate your taste buds. They served most of the authentic seafood dishes from konkan region. The place is good for family dine in and the ambiance is warm and welcomin

This restaurant is right outside esplanade mall and has an amazing location, you can view the beautiful downtown at night. Now the food, this restaurant serves one of the best coastal sea food in Singapore. If you are lucky to get Bombay duck dish, please do try it. My wife loves the tisrya koshimbir dish. The sol kadi is just amazing. Nothing much for the vegetarians though
5
liked the place ambience and the food was tasty. Must try are the maharashtrian dishes which I felt were well done

Good Indian food, particularly seafood. However, we did not like the tandoor dishes which appeared to be underdone. The jumbo prawn ambatt was disappointing. The mutton dum biriyani was, however, delicious. A mixed bag.

After a hectic morning of walking and lugging- shopping bags!!â˜º we booked a lunch reservation at Gajalee at 12.30pm.We managed to make it at 1pm die to rush hour traffic. Thankfully the Esplanade mall was nt crowded that day. Seated at the table we started out with a chilled mango lassi. Starters with crab cooked in butter sauce were divine, as were the tiger prawns cooked in green chilli paste.The mutton biryani was simply superb. Melting chunks of heavenly meat, well marinated and cooked well on slow heat, the mutton thali was equally satiating.. the amazing part was all the meat was boneless but i guess they were cooked with bone and they served. The gravy was so yummy and meaty. Chukka was amazing.Desserts while we had no space in our bloated and very contented stomachs, we had strawberry and vanila ice creams..So yeah, amazing hearty and contented stomachs at satisfying rates, would defintely go again for the chilli crabs and other specialilties. My rating - 4/

I have reviewed Gajalee earlier and my ratings were either excellent or very good. Sadly, I have to give average rating this time (this was our 8th visit). We went for my daughter's birthday as she loves their Bombay Duck Fry. We were informed it was not available as didn't have supply (btw Bombay Ducks are available in plenty in wet markets at this time of the year). We were disappointed but ordered other dishes we usually like. Somehow nothing was as good as we remember from our earlier visits. The Surmai fry was the only saving grace. The clams koshimbir, another favourite of ours, lacked the oomph and chicken sukka masala was nothing to write home about. The portions have become smaller and prices have gone up. I hope we caught them on a bad day and it is not a daily occurrence. Else they really need to look into getting back their earlier standard

This a typical Maharashtra Konkan style seafood restaurant. Fewer tomatoes and onions and coriander and dry stuffing Delicious but different from our north Indian led preferences for Indian cuisines.I went with expat locals who knew what to order so I had varied tastes.Well laid out in large mall in Central Singapore it has an elegance to i

I recommend this restaurant only for al carte seafood. They have very few selection of vegetarian main course. And, their vegetarian main course is not at all worth trying. Even, set lunch i.e. thali is not that impressive. Overpriced food.Overall, i would recommend this place for seafood al carte. NO to thali. NO to their vegetarian

Apparently the ribs are amazing here, everyone had them but me and really seemed to enjoy them. I had the fish burger it was okay, wouldnt go there again, but if i did for what ever reason i wouldnt conplain. Its somewhat satisfying, its just i like places which make me say WOW. This place didnt. I also tried the peachy beachy mocktail not for me much much too sweet, personally i felt sick cause, its just not my type of drink.

I had not tried all the dishes yet but these are the few that really stood out 1. The Bombay duck -is a crisp fried fish done with masala spices. It was as good as any of the one I had tried in top seafood restaurant in Mumbai. 2. The pomfret in Chinese sauce - a very fresh and flavorful grilled fish dishes. 3. The crab in green chili - the sauce was again the highlight which nicely enhanced the crab flavor but did not over powered it. 4. One of the best naan I had tried - fluffy and done to the right thickness. The menu is quite extensive offering both seafood, meat and vegetable dishes. Good selection of wine and were reasonably priced. Service and ambient were acceptable. Suitable for both business and casual dining. Highly recommended

I was visiting again after a couple of years. Earlier it was located at Cuppage, off Orchard Road. Now it has shifted to Colors by the Bay near Esplanade Mall. This place is little bigger and the inside ambience is spruced up but the low footfalls in the area don't do much to uplift the somewhat low key feeling.However the food is good as usual. Our favourite Tandoori Crab delivered full value but the chilly pomfret was not as good. The appearance of the dish was as if it is spinach pomfret with green all over. Somehow when you read chilly masala one does no imagine it to be spinach look alike. The taste also lacked spunk. However the crab carried the day for the evenings experience. Will recommend to act conservative and stick to tried and tasted rather than be adventurous

The Good:- Decent / good food. We ordered the fish tikka (good), chicken tikka (fairly good), and the mutton biryani (very good). The raita accompanying the biryani was okay and the salted lassi was not bad.- Friendly, courteous staff.The Not so good:- Service was rather slow, but perhaps it was so because it was the eve of a public holiday and so it was rather crowded.- We chose the outdoor seating since it was a very pleasant, breezy evening, but it quickly became rather hot with no ventilation when the breeze died. The least the management could do is to put a couple of wall-mounted or standing fans in the area. - Feels a bit pricey given that neither the food nor the ambiance seemed exceptional or outstanding in any way

Excellent Fish and Mutton Briyani! The butter garlic crab which was deshelled was very good as well.
3
The tastes are good but nothing close to the original one in Mumbai, when you are craving for some good mutton and fish fries it is worth it. Try the solkadi it is really good.
5
Awesome food with nice service (with a smile)... The tikka's are to absolutely lip smacking.....fish fry, figs curries are great too. Crab with green masala was awesome too.
Overall a great dining experience !

It is unbelievable that a restaurant of this calibre is available in Singapore. Mind-Blasting!! The Tandoori Chicken is simply oozing with freshness and lit my taste buds on fire! The fish and the chicken curry are beyond words better than Mughal Cooks.

We wanted to go to this place for a long time ..n came back hugely disappointed...Started with the Sol Curry - a coconut drink which is a big favorite of my family...but could not take more than one sip..second was Fish Tikka - Second disappointment..so will not continue with the main course..nothing worth mentioning...just one dish worth some praise was the Clam curry..For the price they charge..i feel we could have eaten in a better place...100$ for 2 people without any drinks or dessert, is on the higher side and the food leaves u completely dissatisfied ...

My wife is a big fan of coastal seafood and we decided to go to Gajalee for lunch. The restaurant is located in the Esplanade Mall and therefore parking isn't really an issue.The restaurant decor is functional and the service is attentive, swift, knowledgeable and warm.My wife likes the solkadi but it can have a bite. I tried the blueberry lassi and it was fairly good.We tried out the Teesrya Koshimbir and the prawn masala. The Koshimbir was much better. The vades and naans were pipping hot and tasty. The surprise for me was that the Chicken Tikka Masala I ordered was absolutely excellent. The chicken was well marinated, succulent and well cooked. The gravy was flavorful without being too spicy. It was a pleasant surprise in a place known for it's seafood.Since our first visit, we've now been there a few times and have had a great meal each time

Went there for dinner on a weekday. The place was quiet with few patrons. Not packed but not empty. So ambiance is not bad.Had Bombay duck for starters which was OK. The pom-fret (stuffed one) was good too.The size and quantity is pretty good, you could easily share one dish among 2-3 persons.The best highlight of the meal was mutton biriyani! Even though this is seafood restaurant, the biriyani was just excellent with right amount of spices. Would love to go again

Like to taste for very high quality Indian food, you can look no further than this place! amazing food, great variety and very flexible The items are a little pricey but each of the dishes are carefully prepared by Chef. I like Singapore Chilli Crab but Masala Crab here was amazin

If you have a taste for very high quality Indian food, you can look no further than this place! amazing food, great variety and very flexible chef! The items are a little pricey but each of the dishes are not far from being perfect!You might not be a great fan of vegetarian food but one must try their aloo-gobi (potato and cauliflower) as well as palak paneer. If you dont find these items on the menu, just ask for them and the chef will make them for yo

On our first visit here. We had thali (set lunch). Which i did not enjoyed much. Would definitly never go there for their thali. On second visit we had al carte. Which left me with positive notes. We had green chili and coriander pomfret fish which was superb. We also had malai palak kofta which was equally good. Naan, chapatis, mango lassi were good. But, i did not like plain sweet lassi. We spent about S$100 for two pax.Overall, i would recommend this place for seafood al carte. NO to thali

Amazing Indian sea food in SIngapore.
Must try the Bombay Duck fry, Pomfret in green chilli masala.
Love the food here!

You are in Singapore and want to have mouth watering meal with Indian taste then it is one of the best restaurant .

We visited the place on a weekday to be on the safer side of getting a nice table and service because of all the reviews we read earlier about the awesomeness of the food there. To our utter disappointment, I am never recommending this place to anyone!The only good thing in the restaurant was the water they served (because it was not cooked by them). The bombay duck (as proclaimed to be their best) was cold and soggy, the potato cheese roll was out of potatoes and cheese! We were not so heartbroken by then, and decided to order their very famous butter pepper crab. The waiter got us a selection of live crabs (which was a bit creepy but satisfying in a way that we were having fresh food), but it was sheer discontent when the crab was served. The crabmeat was tender but the garlic butter gravy was not good at all, it didn't infuse inside the crab and was a total mismatch to our tastebuds. You don't pay exorbitant price for a crab (110$) and expect it to be this bad! We did order few other main course as well like the fish and some vegetarian options like kadhai paneer and dal, but nothing was good. They tasted like food made by amateurs with no knowledge of spice blend. The rice they served was starchy and had clumps. Just to sum it up, the accolades the place has been receiving is a misnomer. There are many other seafood places who serve much better indian coastal food. So if you don't mind paying a lot more than the food deserves, then this is your place. If you appreciate indian food, then this place is a NO GO!

While Gajalee does all the usual Indian naan & chicken tikka masala stuff the expertise of this establishment is Konkani food (western coastal) be it sea food, mutton or anything else, particularly sea food. And they did not disappoin,t we had Surmai masala one of the signature dishes of the cuisine, the fish was very soft and the masala had the impact, the keema (minced mutton) was good and true to the cuisine. Just for the kicks one should try the Sol Kadhi a traditional drink made out of coconut milk & a berry called kokum it looks like a strawberry smoothie but actually has chilli and other spices though I found their version to be little too pungent have had milder versions before and enjoyed it more.The interiors & ambience are nice and they try and give an impression of an upscale eatery. My gripes; the service though friendly was very slow on what was not a very busy Saturday afternoon and it is pricier than most indian restaurants in the same range.But the diversity they bring to the indian food scene in Singapore is welcome

I visited this place twice, once for lunch and then for dinner. Lunch was okay, but not so great as the reviews claim, and for the dinner, I was quite disappointed. As an Indian, I asked them if the food will be different from authentic Indian food, and they claimed that it would be. What I was served was actually lukewarm dish with nothing resembling the original dish. The chappatis I ordered were very soft and tasty. I would recommend fish and seafood, but not other dishes. The service could have been better. The team in hotel can be more organised too.

Visited Gajalee Coastal Seafoods for dinner and it is as good as the reviews suggest. We tried several prawn dishes, fish, various vegetables, rice and naan. Everything was delicious and some of the dishes had an interesting, new twist. The service was very friendly. This restaurant is not cheap and the portions are on the small side, but the quality of the food is worth it

Really, this is the only place to get real Indian seafood even if it is region specific. Love this place. The only let down was the host that kept trying to get us to order more than we really wanted to (clearly to up the bill)
5
As I said in my earlier review, I would give Gajalee 5 stars if clams koshimbir was available. We went there yesterday and am happy to report that the clams were on menu as well as actually available. It made our day. Another star, Bombay duck, was as good as ever and we made a meal out of it. Mutton Sukka was not bad, but I think is best to stick to fish. Desserts could be improved, but I see no reason to reduce ratings for it as it is not their selling point. They specialise in seafood made in coastal regions of western India and excel in that

we went to the place with a high expectation as we have always enjoyed dining at their outlets in mumbai. This is listed as fine dining place ...nothing fine about the place...the paintings on the wall were fine though...everything that we ordered fell short on expectations ....the rates though were in tune with a fine dining place....there wss notnhing "malvani" about the chicken dish they served ...the clam koshibir was bland...we took refuge of a safe khichdi to avoid further disappointments...the dessert was fine..custard caramel...140$ for 2 adults/kids...no alcohol..

We're vegetarians so we weren't expecting much at a restaurant that specialises in seafood, but we were very pleasantly surprised. The food was fabulous, imaginative, hot and tasty. The service was excellent and the staff friendly and attentive. We ate here twice on our Singapore trip and will certainly come again
