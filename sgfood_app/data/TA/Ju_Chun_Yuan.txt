Had a dim sum buffet and for the price is value for money. The items is very fresh and very tasty. Prawns are very fresh. Best to come with a group if friends so that can try more variety.

It was a rather quiet dinner that weekend evening, we intend to have the dim sum buffet but was told it did not serve for dinner. Ordered more than 10 ala-cart dishes, ending the meal with dessert (mango pudding, durian pancake). The food portion is ok, fish is really very fresh. Currently they have SG50 promo for 'Buddha Jump over the Wall' (above $200 receipt entitled to order one person portion at $50

Located in a conserved traditional Chinese house with a nice courtyard entrance, this restaurant is best known for the Chinese delicacy 'Buddha Jump over the Wall'. It is a must-have and is very well worth trying. Charged and served individually by per person, it is a generous portion of all the good stuff in a broth full of flavor. This is the highlight leaving room for little else and the other dishes are rather average anyway

We ate here in a large group, so we had a large catered buffet. Everything they served us was tasty and plentiful. The restaurant is located on the edge of Chinatown and has a nice, relaxing atmosphere. There are too many tables in the restaurant so it was a bit tight, but overall, we liked the place, felt it was a good value for the money and would recommend it

It was a rather quiet dinner that evening. We didn't make any reservation. Service was quick and attentive. we had soup, bee hoon, chinese spinach, pork with mushroom, and a few more dishes. The food was really delicious. portion wise, the bee hoon and spinach were considered small portion as concluded by us. The presentation of chinese spinach was interesting. value : probably a little over for the portion size but this is compensated by their good chef cooking. no dessert were selected as we thought it was too few choices for us. the environment is very typcial chinese restaurant, but the walkway into the restaurant proves it to be different from others. location: it is at far east square (easier to locate using far east square than amoy street). Nearest train station would be mainline Raffles place or telok ayer station. but it is a place that i could return

On the edge of Chinatown white table cloths indicate it might be a cut above it's neighbours. The food is ok, although there was none of the advertised buffet when we werer there.No wine list and only 2 types of bottled beer, indicate that this is not the place for the drinking man. Not expensive

I'm surprised to see mainly negative reviews here. This places offers some pretty amazing value for the city area: only about $20 a head at lunchtime for a fairly wide selection of dim sum. Quality was generally pretty decent, and the staff were helpful. Tea was topped up regularly without having to ask. I've been here twice now and was happy on both occasions. Perhaps will try it for dinner next time

I had been to this restaurant many years back when it just started. I was told it was an award-winning restaurant in Fuzhou China and brought in by one of the late tycoon in Singapore whom loved their food. It was a up-market restaurant and one of its specialties was the Buddha over the wall. The style of cooking was fine, simple but focus on the original flavor of the fresh ingredient and produce. I was quite surprised in my last visit that it had degraded significantly and trying to survive. The menu had strung but the Buddha over the wall was still there. Dishes were just eatable and forgettable. Staff were quite enthusiastic but not organised. I was surprise the restaurant ran out of beer the previous day and was not replenished during dinner time. It has potential and need a major overhaul to get back on its feet

One of the biggest joke of a dim sum restaurant around. We arrived around 11am on a weekend for the dim sum ala carte buffet as we were told the restaurant was fully booked for lunch. We were the only table around for the next 1.5 hours. A single waitress was working and the service attitude was probably more suited for a coffee shop than a restaurant. The dim sum was a let down. Basically overnight and re-heated or in some instance food was served still cold from the fridge. In dim sum, one would expect some finesse in how the item is created and the delicate fresh taste of ingredients. Forget about it here. Not sure why people would even blog and praise the dim sum here

Went there with my mum on 1st day of New Year.The buffet started from 1130am to 0300pm. We arrived at 1200pm. There were alot of options and it was ala carte and you can order up to 5 rounds. We intended to order the dim tsum first and have the noodles last, however, the noodles dishes were announced finished by 0100pm and same for other snacks too.The steam, stir fried and deep fried items were managed by different people in the kitchen. The cold dishes arrived promptly but the steam and deep fried dishes took very long to arrive.We were impressed by the cold dishes and were thinking maybe we can bring people here. After trying the steam dishes, we had reservations. The 猪肠粉 was tough and over cooked.The same for other steamed dishes too.The deep fried beancurd skin with prawns were too salty to be eaten.The durian cake was marvelous though I thought the durian cream inside could be colder.I think the standard had dropped has the kitchen was too busy. I might come back for the 2nd time to see if the standard is better. Hope to give another chance.Oh...one thing... the service was good
