Never tried this place, didn't intend to cos it's vegetarian (and I'm a Neanderthal). But tried it one day and it was pleasantly delicious. Had the dry truffle noodle which was yummy, especially if u add the super hot chilli padi they have at the side for self service. The herbal soup was well cooked and flavourful, even my kids to my surpriseloved it! The laksa noodle was a bit sweet for my taste but still all right. Don't bother with the flower infused teas... they're super sweet and taste like canned green tea. Would be better if they weren't so sweet and were brewed longer. Staff were friendly and super accommodating - helped me cut the noodles for my kids. Will definitely come again

Grove is a go-to for a good one bowl meal! Dry Truffle Noodle (S$8.8), simple awesome! What’s their secret? Is it the noodle? Is it the truffle oil? Is it …? The best way to find out would probably be taste it, enjoy it. Dry Kung Pao Noodle (S$6.8), is one of my favourites. Simple lunch yet feel great

Highly recommended by my Friend who is a vegetarian. We order a set each as each set consist of a main + drink + side. In my opinion, they are not cheap but for the set it's affordable. It cost around $14 for a set depending on what you ordered. They have a reasonable size of option for both rice and ramen. I tried the tom yum ramen on my last visit which I like. This time round, I order the Korean mixed rice. The mushrooms are juicy, crunchy cucumber, spicy kimchi, crispy gyoza as side & iced oolong. The meal make me a happy person after lunch! Will definitely come again & highly recommend for all to try a different kind of vegetarian from the usual fare.

Nice food but less variety after they refreshed their menu. Currently they are offering Japanese and Korean food. Love their ramen. Although their price is on high side, it is almost the same as the green dot but appreciate their creativity in bring diff type of vege food to the public. I went there on sat lunch time, it was pity to see just a few customers there. They deserved better.

Was there on a Friday night, not so crowded when we reached, but was packed by 7.30pm. It is a self service restaurant. Order food and make payment at the counter, a restaurant pager was given. Customer to collect food when ready.Tried the lotus rice and Kung-Bao Monkey Head Mushroom Noodles. The rice was a little too soggy, but the flavor was good. I like the texture of the noodles, and it tasted good in the mild spicy sauce. Another good vegetarian option in a clean environment. Food portion a bit small though
