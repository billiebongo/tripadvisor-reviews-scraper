First time here, rare find as we got to know this place online.
A la carte buffet, quick and friendly service.
Sashimi were fresh, tempura well prepared. Will definitely come back.

Popular with lunch crowds in the area, this cosy restaurant offers good quality yet economical Japanese set meals. They have also started ala carte buffets which are very good value for money.

It's average. Very ordinary. They serve a wide variety but it's quite steep at $80 over for 2 people. Could have order ala carte at other Japanese restaurants with that amount. Service is prompt though.

Had lunch here this week and opted for one of the lunch special bentos. Service was slightly on the slow side but polite. Food was ok: nothing particularly special.

Over-all we were satisfied with the freshness of their food. Service was kinda slow but they were kinda full when we dined, understandable.Choices are ok, the reason is, ive been to other Japanese Buffets with the same price point and they have more choices aside from the usual fair of sashimis.Over-all would be back and would surely recommend

Most items were decent with some hits and misses. Enjoyed the sashimi especially the salmon belly. One can request for this on the order sheet. Although the sashimi cuts can be a little small, they can be ordered repeatedly.Deep fried and grilled items were ok too though they seemed to have been prepared earlier. Our favourite was the mentai salmon. Juicy with mayonnaise on top. Would have been great if prawn roe had been added to the mayonnaise.As for sushi, we enjoyed the unagi one and the aburi sushis. The aburi sushi were better than the aburi alone. Service was relatively quick too and the staff topped up drinks on a regular basis. Free flow green tea, lemon tea and lime juice included. Good value for money and worth visiting again.

Great experience . Good quality was great, you can tell it is freshly cut. Has over 100 choice in that menu. All of it for 38 Singapore dollars. We were a group of 6 people and we ate so much. They kinda told us to order our last meal as kitchen was closing. Not sure if it was true, as restaurant is supposed to close at 11pm, and they told us that at 10pm. Anyway we did order so much , enough for 15 people , we are sushi eater and we just enjoyed it. We were full and we didn't care. Quality was great, services , not much to expect in that area, but decent enough. I'll definitively Go back there after a sushi break.

The food is very fresh and the variety is decent, including the sashimi. Service is good and there is little crowd, which explained why I am reluctant to share in case traffic goes up. It's a gem for Japanese buffet and I will be back very soo

Have been here several times. Food is always good, fresh and nice selection. Location is easy to find and cozy interior.
The staff is very friendly.
Highly recommend that you give SanKai a try for consistently good Japanese food at a very fair price.

I have been here 3 times over half a year, could say that food quality is quite consistent. Waitresses are nice and attentive, however, kitchen may be lack of staff so food came out quite slow.

Awesome Japanese buffet reminiscent of Irodori or Ikoi which have a similar concept. Sashimi are thickly sliced and fresh. Sushi and other cooked food are quite enjoyable too. Service can be slow at busy times. Worth the money if you are a Sashimi lover. Check out below for more information

Not too far Bugis MRT station. Small restaurant but food quality is good especially the sashimis. Bought the voucher from Q0010 for ala-carte buffet. Worth the money for the food we ordered. If more than 6 peoples, entitle for private room. Since it's a small restaurant, there is only 1 private room. Need to make reservation earlier. Me and my friends enjoyed the food and privacy since we manage to reserve the room.

I visited Sankai Japanese Restaurant last month together with my sister. This restaurant offer both buffet & a la carte for dinner and the food is above average. It looks more like a family business and the staff are quite friendly. Good place to stop by & have some meals with friends & family.

Visited Restaurant on 2nd October, it was a extremely small restaurant, I recommend reservations. Food was nice though the Japanese Buffet in Shinkei at Toa Payoh is better. Drinks to be improved. Food is pretty nice. It is recommended to tourist and visitors, shop is easy to find.

Dined here on a Friday night because the wife found a $68 1-for-1 set dinner meal so we thought why not try out this place. The food was just average. If I had to pay $68 per pax it would have been too expensive for this standard of food. The service was friendly enough and the atmosphere was small and cosy. Even though it was a Friday night and the neighbouring restaurants were mostly fully packed this place still had some seats when we arrived around 8pm. Verdict - I wouldn't come back here if there was no special promotion. Here's the menu:1) Appetizer: Tomato Salad with Sesame Dressing 2) Appetizer: Spicy Scallop, Smoked Duck Breast, Octopus Kara Age 3) Sashimi: Tuna Fish and Salmon 4) Grilled Item: Grilled Fillet of Salmon with Spicy Cod Roe 5) Deep fried Item: Deep fried Breaded Prawn with Green Salad 6) Steamed Item: Chawanmushi 7) Main Course: Chashu Rice 8) Soup: Miso Soup 9) Dessert: Japanese Ice Crea

Booked this restaurant under 30licious promotion and it was very value for money. There were 9-course and the food was good. It was a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was not too crowded with only our table and 2 others occupied. Service was great too. We especially loved their braised pork belly. Even without the promotion, the a-la-carte & set menu was very well priced. Will visit again

Had a nice dinner with various sushi's, nigiri, sashimi and edamame. Good sushi (not blown away but doesn't need to be) for an affordable price.Service is kind and fast enough to enjoy a lovely evening. We sat on the sidewalk to enjoy whatever was happening around us

We came here looking for a fast meal before a movie. The menu was interesting as it was broken into two categories as one had 70% off and the other, fairly reasonable priced dishes. We had two miso, avocado and cucumber maki, and tempura vegetables; two drinks (lime and coconut) which came to around $38.We expected fairly fast service but things sort of dribbled out over 25 minutes when we had to ask for our food due to our movie approaching. There appeared to be lots of floor staff doing service. This hastened the arrival of the food which we were grateful for. The wait service was fast and the drinks arrived promptly. What we did receive was nice tasty food.Overall not too bad, but not if you are expecting quick service for a Japanese styled food
