Average tasting food. Service was slow but all in all this was an ok thai cafe. Had alot better and a lot worse. worth a visit if around orchid towers and fancy a snack at a resonable price

Stop there about lunch time. When enter the restaurant doesnt look very busy but after about ten minutes people start coming. Order an ice lemon tea and pad thai seafood, it was sooo delicious. Been in so many thai restaurant as I love asian food, but the pad thai I had was unbeatable. Price is average, maybe bit pricey but hey everything in singapore is bit pricey compare to other asian countries. Would recommend this restaurant

Get off the elevator on the 4th floor, walk through the dark and dingy parking garage, past the seedy massage parlours, dodge the "friendly" girls outside, and you'll find yourself the most amazing Thai food you could find outside of Thailand! The owner will come out & rescue you from the surrounding businesses, if Anthony Bourdaon hasn't come here yet, he should! The green curry is hands down the best I've ever had, pineapple rice is to die for, the Pad Thai is Divine! Definitely worth the effort! Don't let the orange sherbet walls deter you. They only add to the ambience! If you like Larb Gai - you will love it here! And if you want it spicy, try the lemon grass clams. The service is direct and the food comes quickly. If you find yourself in Singapore craving some flavourful Thai food full of spice come here

We found Jane Thai recommended in a local magazine under the category of great cheap eats. We weren't disappointed. We ate in the restaurant, which had the atmosphere of so many local spots, that is simple tables and chairs with wait staff that are efficient but not too chatty. Our food was excellent. The same caution as another reviewer listed--this is located in a building with many clubs, massage parlors, and beauty shops where the beauties were sitting outside the shop, not inside. If you want to avoid the customers to these businesses, I'd go early

If you are interested in an authentic thai food place which is inexpensive, head straight to Jane thai. It has a sit in facility as well as takeaway. Since I was staying at Pan pacific hotel, this place was just next door. A waring- it is located in a building which is a night joint for adults(hope u understand

We had lunch twice in this restaurant, and we both times enjoyed a good meal.We can recommend the green chicken curry and the beef with cashew nuts; the fried rice was very good, both the one's with chicken and with seafood; very affordable (prices between SND 6 and 10).At the top (4th) floor, when you come with the escalator, direct on your left hand sight

A very familiar place where I have always frequented whenever I feel like having Thai food. Located in Orchard Towers of Orchard Road, it is easily accessible and their food standards have been rather consistent throughout the years. Where I usually could only do dinner, they are now open in the day, making lunchtime Thai food a possible choice. Diners uncomfortable with the nightlife scene that unfolds into the night may find a little comfort dropping by in the day instead

Orchard towers is a place with seedy clubs and massage parlours open at 9pm Saturday night. That being said, I never felt unsafe and Jane Thai is not seedy. There is not much decor. The service was great (for Singapore that is hard to find). The green curry was amazing. The basil chicken was even more amazing, but my mouth was on fire after eating it. Good thing I got milk tea to drink, that calmed the spice down. Cash only.

It doesn't look like much and if you read the reviews you will quickly learn that the Orchard Towers is a seedy at best description of the building. None-the-less the Thai food was excellent and moderately priced. The service was quick and friendly as it probably is in most of the Orchard Towers ;) I had the green curry with Chicken and my husband had the Pad Thai with Chicken. Inbelieve its a cash only restaurant so be prepared for that. Overall a great, fast and convenient place with great food and service.

Jane Thai Orchard has opened their second branch in the east side of Singapore. Jane Thai @ Blk 412 Bedok North Ave 2Opening Hours:TUE - SUN 12pm to 9.30pmThis outlet doesn't open till as late as the Orchard Towers outlet but it's still good. Chef from Thailand and very friendly. My parents enjoyed the food very much. My mom requested for extra spicy tom yum noodles and it packed a punch for her (too much for me personally). Green curry beef and pineapple fried rice was delish too
