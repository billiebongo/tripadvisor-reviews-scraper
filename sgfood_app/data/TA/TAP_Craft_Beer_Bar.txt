This is in a covered courtyard area on Stamford Road. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Beer selection is very good. We didn't stay for food, but next time hopefully we can stay longer.

Seeing other reviews being critical was not our experience. A ripping good selection of beers great service and not another customer in sight... perfect at 2.15pm on a hot Monday. $10++ pints can't be beaten really

Showed up at 9.40 on aThursday evening and was turned away hungry. Very disappointing since their website says they’re open until midnight.
Best avoided unless you want to drink on an empty stomach

Visited 5 times over a week and have no complaints about the beer at all. A very IPA heavy list so in that regard I was in craft beer heaven. Sadly the service over the five nights was average at best and non existent on a couple of nights. A couple of the Male staff serving behind the bar were good but the rest let the place down. Here’s some breaking news bar staff - when someone who wasn’t previously at the bar (the last time you could be bothered to look) is stood at the bar with the beer list and a smile on their face, it’s probably more than likely that they will want to order some beer!! The management need to either train or send the staff on a refresher course.

They opened a new one at the Robertson Quay near to the Msocial Hotel. Both outlets still have the legendary $10 pint and also many crafted beer on the Taps. There are also some bar food and Thursday free Spam fries day. The City Hall one is always very popular because of its good location and pretty friendly and helpful staff. Do join their loyalty program to get free beer

I visited the recently opened outlet in Robertson Quay this week for a beer after eating nearby. There's a good selection of beers and the staff are knowledgeable and helpful. They could benefit from having a wider selection of dark beers, but otherwise this place is great. Good value too at just $10++ for a pint (prices are now more reasonable as compared to my last visit to the outlet at Capitol some time back)

Arrived at around 6pm and the place was rather quiet. Sat down with my friend for a light dinner and couple of beers Pretty good selection of craft beers available. Priced at $10 a pint before taxes. Half pints are $8, which only encourages you to order the full pint.Had the sausage platter for 1 and a poutine. Left the place happy after 3pints. It's partially self service, means you'll have to order the drinks yourself if the place is packed

Lucky me! Just right next to my hotel „M Social“ there was this Craft Beer Bar. It is pretty pricy but they serve some pretty decent beers. My favourite was the Mosaic Single Hop IPA. But that one was from the bottle shop which is located in the back of the place. They also serve some bar foods, but I never ate there. But to be honest if you are alone...it is not the same bar/pub atmosphere as in other tap rooms

My husband and I visit fairly regularly for one or two drinks. The service (unless it is very busy) is usually very good and speedy. There are plenty of craft beers on offer, my husband picks a new one every time while I stick to a glass of wine.The price is reasonable for Singapore - $10 beer and $10 wine - all day every day.The food is ok, I wouldn't come here for a full meal, but it is very good to accompany your beverage
5
It was relatively quiet when we stopped here for a few beers on a Sunday afternoon which meant the service was quick and friendly. They have an expansive list of changing craft beers on tap and the staff were happy to explain them to us. Good selection of snack foods available
3
20x craft beers on tap for S$10++ per pint, which is cheap by Singapore standards.
However bar is in a strange place (the corridor of a shopping mall), so not much atmosphere. Also bar staff we not very attentive.
5
$10 beers and loads of varieties. Great place to chill out and sample craft beers from all over the world
4
If you're here from the states, particularly from the West Coast here's your home away from home. Indoors, air conditioned and like the title says, a full selection of Stone Brewing beers

2of my friends had reacahed first and got a table for 5 on a friday evening. After ordering some drinks and food, apparently my friends were told they were on the wait list for table of 5 and the manager (I think) had given another table to a customer. It could have been mentioned before my friend got seated so that we could have possibly wait for the rest before going in (because while 2 of my friends and I were already sitted, one friend could possibly have no seat as he was already reaching the place) or consider another place instead. The manager's attitude wasn't accommodating nor was he friendly. We had intended to stay long but cut our visit short and went elsewhere after that. Even if the prices were "cheap", bad service is such a turn off. Won't head back there. Chijmes have plenty of bars with great service.possibly that many customers were standing and drinking means there's no short of business,but the attitude was uncalled for.
4
You can find something special to imbibe here. Mostly beers from afar (including my native California). But not economical and the venue is to us not inviting. The nachos were lukewarm and scantily clad. The service staff needs to be summoned with an energetic wave, or two

Located inside a modern shopping complex, didn't try the food so can't critic it, looking at menu comfort pub food. At any rate I was here for the craft beer, decent range, think 12 taps? Mainly IPAs from the USA. For the month of July they have a promo $8 for 12oz or $10 for 10oz. These prices are very reasonable for Singapore. 2nd time I've been here definitely worth a visit if you like craft beer particularly whilst the promo is on.

Stopped here for a 9:30 pm snack. Pretty good selection of beers, but nothing even close to local. Most, if not all, of them were US or European beers. The Jo Jo potatoes were excellent. The spam fries were unusual. Good, but a little goes a long way. A nice atmosphere in this street of restaurants inside a mall. A little pricey though. Two beers, potatoes and fries, $40
4
If I was going to open a bar in an upmarket food court then this joint is the blue print. Just a bar, albeit classy, in the literal sense but handles 20 taps with ease. Of course PA and IPA dominates (shame) but not unusual these days I guess. Pricing during a month-long promotion was superb at $10 a pint. Another 30 bottles on the list but at much higher pricing. Service is friendly and efficient and they encourage samples
5
Excellent selection of beers at a very reasonable S$10 per pint.Limited menu of bar type food - good quality, relatively small portions, not cheap - S$16 for a chilli dog, S$12 for a couple of sausage. Don't have pepper in the restaurant!Open type restaurant on ground floor of shopping mall.Definitely worth it for the beer
4
We were in Singapore and looked for the place for a beer. Searching and found this place look good. Actually we went to the other place but nothing really interesting so we moved here. The place is quit pack and menu is interesting. The variety of beer by tap and by bottle. The price is acceptable. Good for hangout with friends
4
try the lost coast tangerine wheat beer and the blackout (smooth handmade caramel ice cream in butter deep roasted modern times black house coffee stout)
3
It just feels weird to drink craft beer in the middle of the mall. There is no ambiance what so ever. Their beer selection is not that exciting either
3
Friend and I recently checked out this place for couple of drinks. Honestly it was an average place for food. I feel it was overpriced. Beer options were pretty good. If you wanna try more craft beers, come here.

3 Up: free popcorn, cleanliness, selection

3 Down: limited seating, cost, uncomfortable bar seating

Sitting at the bar as I type. Great selection. Happy hour prices good. Tasters and advice if you want. Can't complain. Good bar

Excellent craft beer from Canada and the US. This is an American restaurant with an Asian twist. The meal sizes and tastes are altered to cater for the Singapore palates. If you're expecting North American portions you will be slighly disappointed. That being said, the beer selection compensate for this. We enjoyed our visit.

I have grown very fond of this place. Simply a great beer selection, many on tap, and the beer menu is updated frequently giving you ample choice. If you like craft beer, this is a great place.The setting is actually a glassed in open space between 2 historic buildings. Actually, it is quite inviting. Open, airy, and not too loud. Mac & cheese is good, cheesy and filling. Chips and salsa are fine. Other food items are less interesting so I generally go here for the beer rather than the food. Many other restaurants are near if you really need a meal. The beers are not cheapest around, but I Guess that is the price we pay for a wide range of good craft beers on tap, and at a Central location. For me, I am happy with prices and feel I get my money's worth. I have no complaints.Happy hour will save you a couple dollars per beer. The guys know there beers well and can make good recommendations. Johnny, the manager, knows his beers very well. I really like the place

Ask a dozen people their fave craft beer style and you'll get a dozen different answers. That makes tap selection for the management a challenging choice.TAP has several American beers on tap. I didn't ask, but it appears they continue to change the source of each tap regularly.The host to whom I spoke was an American and it appears he makes the tap selection. I wasn't fussed with his choices.I'm an Australian - and Australia makes some wonderful craft beers - and have enjoyed craft beers in over 15 different nations. While the US may be the spiritual home of craft beer, it is not without competition.For each of the beers on tap at TAP that I tried, I've enjoyed infinately better - both from the US and elsewhere.Given that Singapore is a fledgling craft beer 'scene', TAP could offer the best of each beer style from somewhere around the world and make a name for itself. Sadly, the preference for ordinary US beers limits the potential.Next time in Singapore, I'll go elsewhere

Great selection. Owner works in the bar and has a good knowledge of all the product. A cool friendly place and the happy hour prices last all afternoon. Highly recommend - although is very popular on Friday night so be prepared to wait to get in! Mind you; that is Singapore
5
Ok everyone knows alcohol is expensive in Singapore...so if you are going to drink you may as well make it something decent right? For decent American craft beer TAP is definitely the place to go.TAP can be hard to find in the Capitol theatre building but it is worth the effort to sit down relax enjoy premium craft beers like the deschutes fresh squeezed IPA...my personal favourite.Very happy customer

I visited this place in the revamped Capitol Theatre. Excellent selection of craft beer. We had so much fun.
4
I was quite impressed with this place. The beer selection is really quite impressive and so many of them are available on tap. Decent atmosphere and friendly service. Worth a visit.
5
Called in on way home just on the off chance as not been there before. Super impressed by the bar staff ad their knowledge of beer and brewing, as well as recommendations of other places visit. Absolutely first class.

Ok, so here's my review because I think the record needs righting. I really don't feel like they need me to bolster their already soaring cred with my humble review, but anyway, here are my two mites in the cause of all things TAP.As mentioned in my other reviews, the craft beer scene in Singapore is at its most delicate and vulnerable, with hawkers of craft, tentatively putting out new shoots into the beer-naive firmament of Singapore's drink atmosphere. With more than a few customers genuinely inquiring what an India Pale Ale is, it is a gentle time for those venturing into the market to deliver craft beers to thirsty or curious Singaporeans. I have always given 5-star ratings to those who are brave enough to venture out into the harsh unforgiving and often times brutal arena that is F&B in Singapore armed with little more than a burning desire to bring you what they believe to be good to eat and drink. They absolutely deserve all the feeble help my timid review can give them!Ok, so TAP...TAP is brought to you by the same folks that brought you Thirsty, the lovable neighborhood bottle shop that carried a very good collection of American craft beers which when they first started ran afoul of my taste buds when I got a six pack of "old" Blue Moon. The stock is certainly a lot fresher than it used to be and besides being a good thing in and of itself, is also a fair indicator of just how much more Singaporeans are interested in and therefore more willing to fork over serious money for craft beer. This is a fairly recent thing and a very good thing for food and drink in Singapore. Sit at the bar at TAP, or visit Thirsty or The Great Beer Experiment or Druggist and you'll hear more than a fair share of requests for IPAs, something that I have some mixed feelings about. While I am happy that my fellow Singaporeans are exploring the wide and wondrous world of beer and venturing outside their comfort zones of the national-brand lagers like Heineken, Carlsberg, and Tiger, I am a concerned that the IPA is going the way of single origin beans in Singapore, being smothered by that miasma of hipness and being slowly and smugly co-opted as a symbol of sophistication by hipsters. I suppose I really can't knock anything that keeps those kegs actively rotating, and the last thing anybody wants is a beer yenta sitting next to them at the bar...so I'll shut up and sip my beer.As mentioned before, the beers at TAP are disproportionately well-represented by American craft breweries like Stone, Modern Times, Lost Coast and occasionally Mike Hess. This being Singapore, the key is to capture the attention of walk-ins as there are no "regulars" to speak of, customers that come back regularly for the same thing, so TAP keeps the lineup interesting and it keeps changing. At the time of this writing, they just hosted a UK takeover with some very decent ales, some of my personal favourites being the Pale Fire by Pressure Drop, Fourpure's IPA, Cali by Tiny Rebel, Bibble by Wild Beer, Pompelmocello by Siren and the very gravid, very ponderous Tsar Generation 4 by one of my all time favourite UK breweries, Buxton.As I think I mentioned in my review of NickelDime, it is a very nice coincidence that all these places that have ales on tap in Singapore are carving out their individual niches, so you can get some of the most highly rated beers from all over the world in a very small space. Anytime you have that kind of varietal density, it's a good thing, a happy event, a righteous happenstance

I last visited this place about a year ago when it first opened and it left me a great lasting impression so I decided to visit it again this year during my summer break. This visit was disastrous, the staff were not very welcoming which was fine considering its a slow Sunday evening and everyone might have been tired. After choosing a seat at the bar, initially they did not even bother to assist me and my friend in choosing the right beer! It's a far cry from what the service used to be like a year ago. Poor service aside, their lack of knowledge of the beers and in my case stout was very apparent and trying their best to convince me that the best stout they had was also the strongest and priciest. What really put me off that evening was when I discovered my glass was actually cracked, not chipped but cracked. I guess the saying is true, there is always a first for everything but I do not really appreciate these kind of first times. It was just shocking to be served beer in a cracked glass, just imagine how dangerous it could be for an intoxicated person. I might not know much about bartending but it shows that the bar guys do not even check their glasses before tapping them. The bill came to be around 23 Singapore dollars for 2 half pints of stout. Quite pricey in my opinion even if alcohol is known to cost quite a bit in Singapore.Considering the price, the service and that horrifying experience with the cracked glass, I doubt I will be returning for the rest of my summer vacation even if they have a good selection of craft beers on tap. There are definitely better places to hit up in Singapore for craft beers.On a pleasant note, I really enjoyed the stout I got that night! It was really flavourful with this intense chocolate flavour, very different from the ones that I have tried before. It's pity I do not remember the name..

Went by for a late nightcap with a friend on a quiet Sunday. Upon arrival, the two service staff were just talking and refused to even give us any attention. My friend had to go and request for a seat. Decided to sit at the bar, and were promptly ignored once again. A third server finally appeared after what seemed like ages and got us some samples of the beers on tap. Beers were good, great variety. But service and standards were just unacceptable. My friend got served beer in a CRACKED GLASS.If you're up for terrible service, questionable glassware and unequal levels of beverages, this is the place to be. I, on the other hand, will not be going back

Thirsty for beer? This brewpub is hidden in the new Capitol Piazza in City Hall. The guys here know what they are talking about. So, for those who are tap-craft-beer-curious people, nothing to worry, your beer taste buds will be delighted with their recommendations. If you like some nibbles they also have quite a few selections to try. The beers are heavy, just a tiny bit of snacks will do. Have lived in Singapore couple years back, it's great to see that the craft beer scene is booming this time around

A friend with a similar interest in good beer introduced me to TAP Craft. I tried a number of different American-style IPAs off of a good menu of beer.I was told that they regularly turn over the menu with new beers, but at this point it was heavy on IPA style beers.Prices were eye-watering (but inline with Singapore) at about SGD 18-20 per pint. But that being said, at least one can get a good beer...I'll will visit again

Situated in the new refurbished Capitol Theater building atrium where there are a belt of bar restaurants and cafes. It has a nice bar and seating area. Craft beer mainly from USA and light snacks such as sausage platter, sandwiches and pork belly. It is a nice place to chill after a long day in the office or after a spot of shopping at nearby Raffles City etc. A little pricey but go during happy hour and depending on the time you can get S$3 to S$4 off per drink. Cheers

This bar has a good selection of US craft beer - and very helpful staff. Located in the new retrofitted Capitol Theatre building, this is directly accessible from City Hall MRT. Personally I would like to see some UK beers on tap - but the US options are all good real ales
