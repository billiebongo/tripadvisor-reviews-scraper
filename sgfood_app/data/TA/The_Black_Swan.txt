Like the ambience. Food portions will seem little if you have a big appetite. Those attending to us are prompt and polite. Tables are well spaced if you need that space for casual chat with friend

I must declare I went with no expectations but was surprised in the most pleasant way!The ambience was not pretentious and simple Food was excellen. It was fresh, simply presented but "O-so-delicious". Coupled with the superb wine pairing recommendation by Jonzen Chow our sommelier, our dinner was made all the more memorableKudos too to the staff for the overall excellent service.Will certainly make the journey back for a repeat

A special occasion dinner as it was my friends birthday. We started our evening at the bar ordering some nice bubbles and cocktails before seated for our dinner. The ambiance and decoration is awesome, I love this art deco style, and the bar is the center of the interior. I would say that the male bar keeper could have met our eyes and smiled, but this was balanced by the sweet waitresses that was attentive all evening. We were seated at the table and ordered our mains. I opted in for the surf and turf and was positively surprised. Presentation and quality of the food really great. For dessert we had birthday special as well, all nice and tasty. We had excellent wines, and the sommelier gave us a recommendation that was really great. All in all this was a pleasant surprise. I felt that the service, quality and overall experience all deserve a 5 star. A bit pricy for a meal so for special occasions this is good. Our table was at the wall, that made it more private and intimate. So select your table wisely depending on the occasion. The location is great, including the outdoor bar

I had a lunch meeting there and had a comfortable 1.5 hours. We ordered our food and it took over 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive. This was only because I had to chase the waiter twice so imagine if I didnâ€™t it would probably have taken longer. End up we ran out of time and had to cut short the meal. On the flip side, the food was very good and well thought out. Two thumbs up on the food but I would not do lunch there again unless you have about 2 hours to eat.
5
Their steak is excellent. It's a great restaurant for a date. Table is close. So it can be a bit noisy depends on your neighbor
4
Delicious and well presented food, food portion was good for set lunch, pricing a relatively higher due to good location. Seating arrangement between tables were a little close
5
Cheap and good happy hour with $9 per house pour/house wine at a very decent quality! Very good service and i loved the fire ball!
4
Convenient location, staff are tentative and very nice interior/atmosphere. Good for couples/work drink
5
The environment was very conducive for talking business, compared to other restaurants that become very noisy.Kudos
2
There for lunch.Put on the high chairs but they were extremely uncomfortable.Servers were not helpful, did not really explain the dish.Extremely long wait for the food.Price paid does not justify the overall experience
3
Visited the dimly lit restaurant on a weekday night and surprised to find many diners. Food was presented nicely. The taste was good but not mind-blowing.
5
Great food, nice atmostphere, and wonderful service. Will definitely return in the near future. xxx
4
From the moment you step in, you are well greeted and serve till you end dinner.very good place for dining
5
It was a dinner celebration for my friend as her last single night and hence decided on the Black Swan.We ordered the Duck Leg Confit, Mac and Cheese, Calamari and Oysters.All dishes were cooked perfectly and the oysters were really juicy and fresh.The dinner was on a pricey side but service and food were totally awesome!It was an unforgettable dinner that night
3
Yes, I know overpriced and underwhelming describes 50% of the restaurants in Singapore but this place could be so much more than it is. I had a boring salad and a tasteless burger as part of the 42 bucks ++ set lunch. The Staff were efficient and pleasant and location is good - the food let’s it down.
4
The décor and ambience of the place is really nice and lunch menu is value for money and nice. Worth a visit!
3
Dined here for a year end dinner. The place was nice, but at the time we went, the food took a while to arrive. Not sure if it was timed that way or if the kitchen was particularly busy that night. Had the steak, and the serving looked like a lady's size, which was fine with me, but I think the men in my group were left wanting
4
Ambience was great with nice food and great service. The truffle fries was good. Dessert menu could be improve.
3
We had a company lunch on 7 Dec, I ordered a-la-carte, Lobster Thermidor (mains) @ sgd60++, am very disappointed as it’s not as fresh as I anticipated & expected. It served with fries as side, which was not crispy, but soaked in oil ! As for the starter, Pan-seared scallops @ sgd29++ it’s frozen quality. Dessert: Coffee Profiteroles was the only item that’s acceptable. Overall review, not worth it ... and the service is relatively slow but servers were friendly !
2
I used to like The Black Swan for its lunch options. The burgers and Caesar salads were good. In recent times the prices have gone up a lot and the service has gone downhill. I dined with one other person. We decided we didn't want a full set lunch and decided to share. We were told we should get one lunch and an additional appetiser. We didn't want it. When we then asked for an additional plate, the server then repeated we should not share a set lunch. The prices are way too high for a set lunch compared to other options in Telok Ayer Street and Amoy Street with great food and good service. Go elsewhere for a good lunch experience at a reasonable price.
5
The ambience, food and service are great! I will definitely come back again. Keep up the great work
3
Nice Art Deco ambiance. Came on a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was busy.. a good sign...we ordered our food and drinks..The drinks took a while other than the wine to arrive. Our appetizers took an even longer while to arrive, possibly 25 minutes, and the truffle fries came amidst our main course!!!All in all, the food is delicious but a dime in a dozen. A restaurant I certainly will not miss and would prefer to go else where with better serving time management.
5
Other than the fact that the dinner started later than indicated, everything else was amazing. The food, the whiskies, the education behind it all, and the ambiance. All spot-on.
2
The visit was meant to be a birthday celebration for a friend of ours. We had made reservations and we have gotten our table, so that kinda saved 1 demerit point.The restaurant was nicely decorated with dim and intimate light settings, ideal for couples and those celebrating special occasions. Staffs were all nicely dressed in their uniforms. Their happy hour oysters were going at $2 per piece and we were informed that it was Fine de Claire oysters from France and I thought "wow, good value!" and we ordered our oysters. When the oysters arrived, they looked pathetic. Well, guess we pay peanuts, we get monkeys. We immediately regretted our choices of having the $2 oysters, as they were just so thin! They were as thin as tissue sheets, no joke, no exaggeration. I never had fresh oysters this thin and small before.We ordered our mains which included Duck leg confit, Black Swan Burger and the Wagyu Ribeye. Duck leg confit was average and the orange sauce was cloying, chef might want to consider reducing the amount of sauce for the duck leg confit. The pistachio boudin noir didn't help much with countering the sweetness of the sauce.The Black Swan Burger was also average, there are definitely better burgers out there and it was just overpriced.The most frustrating part was the Wagyu Ribeye. It took about 40 mins and 3 rounds of junior staffs having to check on our order before it finally reached the table. By the time the ribeye arrived, the rest of us have finished our main courses. Not once the Supervisor or AM or Manager came to check on us. Maybe we were not their high-spenders so we don't deserve their hospitality.Service was pretentious - while the staffs were nicely dressed, they lack the human touch which is essential in their jobs. When I tried to call for bill, I raised my hands and was trying to get attention and I saw a staff who obviously saw me as we made eye contact and she just turned around and ignored me! I understand that maybe she was not in-charge of our area as she was standing opposite, but she could have at least acknowledged and asked either one of the 2 seniors in front of her, who were goofing and playing around to attend to us. But NO, she just ignored me completely and stood at one corner and continued looking at me! Either she was daydreaming or she was too arrogant.Overall, it was quite an unpleasant experience despite the prime location, expensive decor and the pricey menu, they just don't add up together. I will probably not return again

Came for the happy hour drinks which didn't disappoint. However the steak was overcooked (asked for Med rare) and ruined a wagyu striploin
4
we decidd to try Black Swan as it was near the building we had a meeting. the service was informal and the place was crowded ona friday night. the tables we were ushered too was close to the others and conversations easily eavesdropped. we tried the happy hour oysters at $2 each and had proseco amd white wine which seemed a little small in quantity. i tried the 11 oz wagyu ribeye and the steak was really good. my wife took the lobster thermidor. i would stick to steak in such a chophouse. service was reasonably good and friendly
5
Met up with a group of friends & wanted a relaxing time. We were early, so Sat outside & had a few drinks. Though our table for dinner was available, we only had to go in when we were ready. Service was efficient & no one rushed us. All-in-all, a really nice relaxing evening.
5
An oasis in the middle of the business district. Quiet. Great food. Attentive service. All in a 1030s building.
4
This is my second visit to The Black Swan and the experience is as pleasant as the first time. We were celebrating a belated birthday for a friend & the manager/sommelier Yang gave us good recommendation of the food and wine. Prices were a bit on the high side but service was excellent. The ambience was nice and chilled. It's located near my office and we had no problem finding car park at The Republic Plaza which has a flat rate of $3.50 after 5pm
5
Enjoyed my visit to The Black Swan, as the Restaurant has good happy hour deals - $9 drinks and $2 oysters.
4
Food and service was good but the place was a little too noisy for a couple's dinner. Better suited for a group gathering
4
Upscale restaurant in the business district. Very nice decor and food is good. They have 2 & 3 courses lunch at reasonable price
3
The set lunch seems to be increasing in price steadily. It's not really good value anymore. Too many of the dishes require a substantial add-on price. There are better value set lunches in other nearby venues which have nice ambience as well.
4
Well worth a visit. The service was second to none and the food was excellent. The Art Deco inspired space is beautiful and has a good feel to it. Good location in the CBD. The burger was a big hit and the duck parfait is to die for
4
Nice bar for client drinks or catching up with friends in the CBD. Not necessarily cheap, but the service is good and the food is on point with a great range of snacks. Good range of cocktails and shorts on offer. Only serve Stella Atois on tap!
5
Visited Black Swan numerous times and it’s time tested dishes never fail to satisfy our hungry tummies. Good service, relaxing ambiance and fantastic food. Don’t forget the lip smacking cocktails too
5
I was there with my family and we really love the ambience. :) The service was great too and the staff were attentive to our requests. They brought us to the washroom upon knowing that we are looking for the washroom and see us to the door when we left!The pasta we had was quite special, different from what I usually have. The lobster was good too! We really love the black swan fire ball! It was spectacular and comes with a unique mix of berry and chocolate taste!
5
Nice ambience and convenient location. It is located within walking distance from Raffles MRT station. Drinks and food selection is great! Desserts were fantastic! They are pricey but well worth it!Service is excellent. Those who attended to us were knowledgeable and attentive. Excellent suggestions and they were quick to serve.A great place to gather for drinks and dinner. I would recommend Black Swan if you a looking for a slightly formal place to gather for drinks and dinner.

The Black Swan, opposite my office in Singapore has always just been on the other side of the road. I've wall passed but never ventured inside. Recommended by a friend however met up with friends their and found a lost treasure of place, which I had ignored for years. On a lovely balmy evening, we sat outside in the garden enjoying a few drinks and some really good bar snacks. Great atmosphere, young and enthusiastic staff make this a great hang out. Happy hour is well worth a visit, while lunches and dinners are awesome and reasonably priced. Apparently there is a Jazz room here, which I missed on this occasion but I will be back.
2
The place attracted me after seeing many pics and we tried their burger on a week-day evening.The place has indeed a nice potential but finally, the quality of the decoration, food and service is regrettable. The staff makes lots of twirls to impress the clients unnecessarily and the food is really average. Not a good ratio quality/price. The beef in the burger was actually a poor quality patty (surely mixed with fatty pork meat), bad sauce and over salty French fries.We will not come back unless they improve the quality
5
Excellent service, great atmosphere, would come back again! can call your friends go down in a group for drinks and some great bar snacks
4
The Black Swan is great for lunch or dinner and drinks. Many high tables and also low table seating. Excellent food but portions are small, so order accordingly. Good selection of wine, beer and cocktails. Nice upstairs for cocktails.
5
Marvellous evening with a friend, topped off with excellent food and attentive services. We will be back
5
Visited for a business lunch with my associate and ordered the set lunch. We requested a more tucked away corner. The place is pretty packed during the lunch hours, the service crew managed to find us a quiet table and we still managed to get our food served promptly. Service have been great throughout the whole lunch and food is surprisingly great
4
We ordered stockyard wagyu porterhouse steak for 2 pax - it was so good though it was a bit pricey! Would revisit for another round of steak next time
4
Ambience and great service staff especially the manager on duty!! He was so prompt all the time. We needed to change the table because we could feel the heat coming in through the gaps of the window... can't blame anyone... it's a really old building any case... The food is not bad but the portion a little small. I think the oysters were okay only and not very well shackled. We had a great time... ended the night with a complimentary dessert and 3 other desserts we ordered. The Oreo one is a must try!! Simply amazing!! We went to the back for a look see and I think it's perfect for a group setting if the weather permits. I actually find the bar too rowdy
5
Visited for the 2 course set lunch to celebrate a birthday. The service upon arrival was good even though the place was crowded.The food was tasty and well plated. I made a comment in the reservation that it was a birthday meal, and they actually took note of that and served us a free berry dessert with a candle and happy birthday words on it.
5
We visited to celebrate my wife's birthday. The oysters were superb, and the overall food and drink was excellent.We were also very impressed with the service. It was very professional, and very attentive. They really know their menu and can recommend the best options for you. The food menu is not huge, but it is of great quality.I will definitely go back again

At the midst of hustle bustle of town, this restaurant was tucked in a quiet and historical building with 1930s feel of grand dame bistro.The restaurant was packed when I arrived on Friday lunch time. Although it was packed and with buzzing noise of diners, we were still able to hold conversation.The service staff were prompt although I noticed some female servers were too busy to the point unable to cope. Good thing the other male staff were prompt to take over. A great teamwork.Set menu $42 has interesting dishes to chose for. I chose Beef Tartare as my appetizer. The meat was really good pieces. Hidden underneath there were two medium runny boiled quail eggs. The combo of the runny yolk and seasoned beef resulting in smooth and satisfying bite in each mouthful scoop. Love it! I recommend this if you can take raw stuff.As for the main, I chose skate wing, not many places serve skate wing. This fish is similar like stingray, flat white fish. It was interesting but I find the cooking method could be improved. It was slightly battered and fried, served without dressing. Personally I find it was too oily. Even the spinach which was supposed to be a garnish, was drenched too oily in sight. It looked like it was deep soaked in oil that became translucent. The mushroom soaked the oil quite a bit. Fish was just ok, but if I ever come again, I will choose other dish.Add $6 to end with sweet note. I chose coffee profiterole with homemade marsala-wine ice-cream. They are great if not average. A decent two orbs drizzled with generous mocha sauce and good ice-cream. What could be better? Probably as the name suggest, there must be coffee flavor either in the ice-cream or coffee sauce. The mocha flavor on the sauce was too faint. Can it be like one ice-cream be coffee ice-cream and the other would be marsala-wine ice-cream? For this case, the marsala-wine ice cream was again quite faint flavor for me.Another dessert to choose was Berry Merengue Dome with home-made ice cream. They are generous with mixed berries. If you like Merengue, this was great choice as the sweetness is balanced out with some tartness from berries. The ice-cream was hidden under the dome. Nicely presented with burst of colour. Definitely instagrammable
5
Cozy and staff are friendly. Food is well presented and tasty although is a bit pricey. Worth the experience.
4
The food is good and the service staff are very polite , they are well versed with the food menu and did great recommendations on the choice of food is very good
5
Cheesy as it is, I love the Black Swan burger. Went with my girlfriend and had a lovely time chatting with her non-stop.
4
location is convenient and easy to find. the service is warm and professional. wine selection is considered wide. just a little a bit expensive is you are strict on the food standard
4
It was my first visit to black swan and I liked it. I was alone and looking for a nice bar to just hang at and chill out. The Black Swan wasn't really my first choice cos it is quite a swanky place for the business crowd (it was my day off and I was in jeans and t shirt), but it turned out to be a good choice. The minute you come in you're greeted by the host (she was a very cute, pleasant young lady with bangs and an outfit with pearls ala US Prohibition era style) makes you feel welcome and right at home. The bar staff (a lady and a Chinese guy) were attentive and polite, and reciprocated when engaged in conversation. My only critique is they could've reminded me of the Happy Hour time (it was from 5pm, but I arrived and ordered at 445pm) then my beer would've cost 10++ instead of 18 bucks. But all in all, I appreciated the experience and will definitely come again
5
The set lunch food tasted great and portion is generous. Service was excellent. Ambience was awesome too
4
Been away from town for a while, and having read about it, decided to pop by to have a meal. Service is good, food is fusion and tasty and of the right portion. Nice gesture for the cookies treat
5
Nice restaurant with a nice ambience, been there a couple of times now for both business lunch and dinner. A good hangout place after for work drinks, classy bar at the top floo
3
Food was mixed.. hits and misses. Service staff was not attentive and we had to pour our own wines despite the restaurant being relatively empty on a Mon evening. Sommelier gained my brownie points, not only was he good with wines, he is only knowledgeable and passionate about introducing the dishes.
4
We stopped here for a drink and were hoping to have a couple of appetizers. The place, albeit quite dark, is really interesting with its art deco design (which I love art deco). We had a cocktail (Boulvadier at $22) and a glass of white wine ($16). We so wanted to have an appetizer, but the menu for bar bites was "uninspiring". But, we still rate it a good place to stop and have a drink
4
The pork chop was one of the most tender one that I've tried and though it was juicy, I felt the dish was missing out on some veg and fries. We ordered a separate serving of truffle fries and it proved to be the right decision. The serving size was right and the amount of truffle was just nice, not too overpowering
4
First time here on a dinner date. The two mains we had were the Razor Clam and Periwinkle Pasta, and the Stockyard Wagyu Ribeye. Both dishes were amazing. The Ribeye was good on its own without any sauce.Only con is the atmosphere of the place itself. Due to the number of diners and size of the restaurant, it was pretty noisy and hard to have a decent conversation
5
We didn't know what to expect, and there weren't many detailed reviews online either. The server that sat us down forgot to give us menus and offer us water, so that kinda ruined our first impression. And it was hard to get their attention as well, but we understand that they were understaffed and seemed busy. But the servers were very friendly and made us feel comfortable. We each had a steak and they were tasty! Looove the roasted garlic that comes with the steak. The pavlova was well-executed as well! So thank you! Will bring my parents there soon
2
I left the restaurant with mixed feelings. We came here for steak, and compared to Bochinche as an example, The Black Swan is a disappointment. Priced at the higher end of the scale, you would expect there to be something "special", a candle on the table, nice bread of various sorts (multigrain, baguette, sourdough, etc) to start off with, maybe an amuse-bouche, etc. Nothing of that sort. The small bread roll to start with was completely tasteless. Crispy Calamari were very good. The USDA Tenderloin was ok, however Bochinche has the better meat at this price scale (I'm not affiliate with Bochinche, I write this out of personal experiences). The mustard I requested was served in a small aluminium cup. No choice of different mustards in original containers/glass. The TBS burger at SGD 32 was ok, however I can get the same at Robertson Quay or Clarke Quay for SGD 20-25. The highlight of the evening were the Green Asparagus, these were world class. As to dessert, again mixed - Apple Tart was excellent, Profiteroles at SGD 16 (!) a complete letdown. So overall our visit would probably command a three star rating. However, to top it off, I was charged SGD 27 (!) for a Campari Orange. That's a complete rip off. I would not go back to the Black Swan, there are plenty of other excellent places where for a SGD 200 bill, the experience offered is way better
5
Definitely worth coming back. The service is impeccable. As I am pregnant, the waitress offered to apportion the beef which I was sharing with my friends and cook it to medium well for me. The marination of the steak was done right too. So tasty even without any sauce on it
3
Staff was friendly and attentive, food was good. Only downside was that there was hair on my plate......
2
Having purchased a "Chef's Dinner for 4" voucher for SGD540 in a charity auction we were looking forward to what the Black Swan would deliver for that amount. We were disappointed. Firstly, there is actually no "Chef's Dinner" on the menu so the waiters quickly put together a 3 course menu for us - this comprised basically the three cheapest items on the menu: a Caesar Salad (SGD19++) (which was good), A Tajima striploin Steak (SGD60++ with no sides) and an Apple Pie (about $10++). To make up for the shortfall they provided a single lobster dish to share between 4 and a single portion of fries between 4. All in all, it might or might not have added up to the value of the voucher based on the menu prices, but it was certainly not an example of the chef providing a little bit more for those willing to follow him on his "Chef's Menu". More importantly though, the food:Caesar Salad was very tastyThe steak was appalling: firstly I don't believe the steak was a 4/5 marbling Tajima wage beef as claimed on the menu. It was tough despite being cut about 5mm thick - a thickness which I might expect in a korean BBQ, but certainly not the right way to cut a stripling. The result was a flash-fried piece of meat which was cold before it even hit the plate. It wasn't tasty, it just felt mean and fraudulent. It came with nothing else on the plate, so the single portion of fries we had to share (about 3 each) didn't go far.The lobster was quite tasty although a little to much cream in the sauce.The apple pie was pleasant but I suspect it was bought in from Paul or some other bakery.Wines are crazily over priced and a gin and tonic is $21++.The restaurant has acoustics which make the background sound somewhat overwhelming so it is not possible to have a comfortable conversation without shouting.The stone topped table had not been properly wiped so was covered in stains.Overall, this is not a place to recommend or visit. It is just poor, overpriced food catching a few business expense accounts from the CBD.Give it a miss
5
Friendly staffs!!!Excellent service!!!Great tasting food!!!Fresh oysters!!!Lack of music ambience!!
3
lovely place for date night.. service was attentive .. good vibes overall.. food wise.. the pork chop was delicious.. the mac and cheese a bit runny though..if you have space for desserts. do go for the cookies and cream which comes in a spiked versio
5
Everything about this place is superb. Drinks, food, service! We've been there couple or times now as a team. Looks like we'll be coming back for more
4
Went for the 2 course set Lunch. Pork chop very highly recommended. The meat and fats almost melt in your mouth, leaving you wanting for more! Desserts are not super fantastic unless you must have a sweet finish. Service was expected. tables were spread out enough to hear ourselves talking. First come first serve for the low dining tables. Difficult to eat on the high tables
5
Received very prompt service throughout the night. They have ran out of oysters when we got there by 830pm, and the waiter was very proactive in offering us a platter of oysters complimentary for our next visit! Thank you for the wonderful dining experience.
4
This place is good for both a cheeky drink & bar snacks (including Oysters which are very tasty and let me to decide I wanted to have dinner there), as well as fine dining. The Surf & Turf is fantastic as is the cheese platter for desert. The sommeliers are well experienced/trained and personable but the waiting staff lack a bit of customer service training and don't seem to have a problem making it obvious to you that they're stressed.Overall very good, but not good enough to be called excellent
1
I made a reservation few months back for a friend's hens night party and was just informed today, two weeks before the reservation date, that my reservation has been canceled due to an "exclusive buyout" on the same day. Whilst I understand that my small group reservation is not as profitable as a exclusive buyout, I have lost my confidence that they will fulfill my future reservation. Come on Lo and Behold Group, I am sure you can do better at client servicing
5
Lovely restaurant and the menu looked good. We sat in the garden and had the bar snacks under fairy lights to live music. Very nice in the center of the CBD
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday, it was a party of 4. We sat on a round table on the right of the restaurant. I call it the chill and romantic side. It wasn't as noisy and rowdy as the left side which is for the folks having drinks as main course. We had the porterhouse steak, duck confit, aberico pork, lobster thermidor, truffle fries, calamari, apple tart and the idea and baileys milkshake dessert. Everything was superb. We had only good comments for the food. Oh! A couple of us reach early, in time for happy hour which come with $2/oyster promo. Would definitely retur
5
Went with a visiting friend for the oysters. Love the ambience and professionalism. Good staff, nice drinks and oysters. Generous serving of wine by glass
5
Nice place for dinner and celebrations. Great service too! The food was delicious and prompt services.
5
As with all the other Lo & Behold Group restaurants, the service at The Black Swan was absolutely stellar. All the servers and the supervisors/managers were always beaming, and very attentive to us. Unlike many other restaurants in Singapore, the service here never felt insincere and their demeanor was always friendly but professional. While my beef tatare took a bit longer than expected, it tasted great and definitely not deserving of any demerit.We had a fantastic time at The Black Swan, so thank you
4
Went there with friends because we were looking for a nice place to have a burger. They offer actually only one burger. Nothing amazing but still pretty good. Maybe a bit expensive. But the place is very nice and quiet, which is great to find in Singapor
4
Friendly staff who serves their customers with pride and great tasting food. Especially their coffee profiteroles which were yummy and fun to eat with your hands.
4
The staffs are friendly. The atmosphere and food were good. Ordered a duck confit and pork chop. They are highly recommended.
4
On a packed friday afternoon, service & food was still top notch. Value for money with quality food, very much explains the crowd on every day
3
my colleagues had a great time here chilling out and chatting away the a long FY closing... but it's super crowded making it really tough for wait staff to get anything much done with reminders and missed ordersthe tall cocktail tables & limited high chairs makes this more of a standing type do with very little space to leave bags somewhere safe and within reach without blocking someonewhile we'd folks in our group coming and going, there wasn't really any space for people to move about freely to mix or mingle once you've found a spot you gotta stay stick for a bitthe extensive menu is chock full of drinks for all tastes and the food is exquisitethe décor is amazingbut i cannot say I'd recommend it for large groups as they'd made it real difficult for anyone to keep track of everyoneLooking at the mess I'd say even couples will have a hard time enjoying a night out here

I was at the Black Swan yesterday evening for the birthday celebration of a friend. It was not the best of experiences unfortunately. Food was decent, cocktails good (I had the Golden Parachute) - but it was the service experience itself that greatly disappointed. My friend and her husband booked a private room that was in the basement of the restaurant to celebrate her birthday. To begin with the sound system kept stalling. It appeared that a weak wi-fi link prevented the music from playing. Apparently, Black Swan had prepared a playlist but due to the weak connection, it could not stream. In the end, us guests offered our own phones that had music pre-downloaded to use as music for the evening. Had us guests not have music, the atmosphere would have been very different. It isn't the biggest issue, but when you think of hiring a room for a private event, these are basic amenities that should be working.The other issue that I observed was towards the end just as we were leaving. For keepsake purpose, my friend asked for a copy of the drinks menu in which the restaurant had printed out specially for the event. It had the drinks she had selected for her guests to select from. The staff on duty who had taken over the earlier server, could not find this. Again, this is not the biggest of issues, but it was my overhearing of the manager-on-duty tell the server who was helping us "Just get their email, and send it to them" as he walked away - that really surprised me. We were a group of 12 people who had a 4 course dinner, with drinks, and dessert and cheese who had booked out a room for an intimate event. Such an off-hand laissez-faire take to the request, left quite the bitter taste even if the food itself was good.Oh, and I should mention also that the staff dropped the birthday cake before we could sing and cut the cake. The restaurant managed to salvage the cake so we we could still eat it but the design on one side of the cake was gone.My experience was that as a guest to my friend and her husband. I'm not sure how the restaurant compensated them for the cake. But service wise, you can't lie about the facts or what I observed just as a guest.I think the Black Swan has a great thing going - the decor and vibe is really cool, and the food and drinks alright. I would come here for casual gatherings. But would think twice before holding any corporate functions/private events here
4
The ambiance was nice, good portion. Pork chop was juicy and not hard. Dessert was interesting but coffee was on a high side, $8 per cup is abit too expensive. Had to call many times for staff to refill water but still not don
4
The Black Swan is always a good venue for meetings and set lunches/dinners. The service is attentive and the atmosphere is nice. The building has an Artdeco feel.
5
We had dinner here on a mid week evening. The service was excellent and the menu was nicely put together. Its a chop House style place so be warned. The meat was very nicely done and the wine choice super

They changed the menu, don't like it. Took away many of the good stuff. Staff was rude too. Used to be my fave
4
Went there for my boyfriend's 21st birthday dinner and was pleasantly impressed by their service and quality of food. Their steak is a 5/5 from us
4
Good ambience Casual yet classy Well stocked bar and a good menu. You will not be disappointed. The loud chatter of people and hum drum make for a lively evening and then cap it off with a visit to a night club for late partying

Black Swan shines because diners can enjoy a fantastic western meal in a restaurant carefully designed in art decor characteristics. A gem in Singapore.

On Friday, I went for an after work drink and took one of the outside tables. Initially the staff allowed me (after asking) to sit at one of the larger high tables but then the Australian manager came to me and said that I couldnt sit there. Then I moved to a smaller table and ordered a drink. Then she came back to me and asked with how many people I was. I said 2-3 and then she said you cant sit here and I will need to separate your table. I didn't object but clearly they didnt feel welcome. Then after a while I noticed that a lot of people were smoking outside. I asked the staff where the designated smoking area was and she mentioned that guests could smoke everywhere. This is clearly not in line with the NEA rules for outdoor smoking. A bad experience..

Stepping into Black Swan felt like I was transported into a 1920s bar, very much like the movie “Midnight in Paris”. The ambience was suitable for a romantic dinner or for a party. Service was impeccable. Arriving early, I was asked if I would like to take a seat at the bar to have a drink while waiting for my friends. After we got our table, the waiter was knowledgeable on the menu and made recommendations on the popular dishes. Did not go wrong with the proposed dishes.The Alaskan Snow Crab Salad set the palate right. The sourness of the citrus vinaigrette made us hungry for more. The sweetness of the crab attested to its freshness and worked very well with the fruits. The Pan-Seared Foie Gras was so sinful; it was cooked to perfection. Deviating from the conventional, it was served over corn and hazelnuts.Next were the main courses. The Grilled Whole Cracked Maine Lobster was so sweet and succulent, pulling away from the shelf easily. It still had the saltiness of the sea to it. The melted butter that accompanied the dish made it all that more sinful. The Stockyard Wagyu Ribeye was so tender. With the add-on of the Bone Marrow, it was matched to the tee. The richness of the marrow with the beef melting in our mouths, felt like we were in heaven. In comparison, the Duck Confit was so-so. It was good, but couldn’t match up to the amazingness of the other two mains. The flesh was tender, but the skin wasn’t crispy enough. With an additional side of the Grilled Asparagus with Truffle Hollandaise, the main course was complete.For dessert, we had the Classic Apple Tart and the Dark Chocolate Dome. The chocolate was rich but not too much that it made us sick. The apple tart was superb, paired with the ice-cream, gave us hot and cold sensations in the mouth
5
A ladies luncheon for 8 was accommodated easily through Chope.The set lunch menu @$42 for 2 course , add $6 for the 3rd is value for money. Better still, the set lunch is a mini-version of their à la carte menu.The blue swimmer crab salad was a fresh start, followed by a steak frites (although I substituted that for greens). The USADA strip loin was done perfectly to a medium as requested. I finished up with a full-bodied black coffee.The service was impeccable and unobtrusive. Despite not having carpets, the din wasn't oppressive. A good place for lunch which is easily accessible by the mrt
4
Restaurant is right smack in CBD so perfect for business lunches. Set lunch is about 42++ and the menu changes quite often. Both times I went for the pasta for main course and I think the quality is consistently good. Love the brass details in the restaurant interior. Book early to avoid sitting at the high tables if you like low table dining.
5
Wonderful catch up with friends we all went for their burger and truffle fries - the burger was huge and Super juicy, fries were crispy and tasty - great service and great ambience x
4
I highly recommend the hours between 5-8pm when they have the $2 oyter $9 house pour promotion. We got there about 730pm and still had time to enjoy quite a few of the fine de claire oysters which were delicious.We stayed on for dinner and I had the razor clam periwinkle pasta - very tasty and the clam was cooked just right (slightly crunchy and chewy). My partner had the very thoughtfully crafted cauliflower steak (if you are in the mood or on a diet) which he thought was delicious.If you want to dine/relax al fresco (and maybe have a smoke), they have a large outdoor patio area which also featured a 3-person band (not loud) when we were there. I liked it.Overall, we like the relaxed ambience and service - was a little bit pricey (dinner) though
4
would be perfect if we didnt have to wait such a long time for our food- after asking them to check a couple of times. neighboring table got their food first despite them placing order later. Excellent food.
5
Service was good and attentivefood was fantastic. we had the pork belly and lobster and we love how the sauces goes so well with each dish.. it just gives u the "wow' feeling when u pair the food with the sauces provided. just a little bit too noisy to have a good conversation at the seat we are seating.All in all, a good experience and we will definitely be going back again.
4
Good food and drinks. Service was also splendid. Although it can be a bit noisy as the bar is opp the dining area.
3
I went to Black Swan during a weekday evening for dinner. The service over there was really good and good recommendations on the menu.
5
A very nice meal in a unique restaurant. We went for dinner at 7pm and by 8pm it was almost full. The food, service and drinks were great. Service became a little more intermittent once the restaurant was full, but nothing too extreme. To improve the overall experience, I think some of the tables need to be removed. There was a feeling once the place filled that we were sitting on top of others, and those new diners joining on either side also made comment on the proximity of the tables next to them - small niggle only. Overall experience was great and we had a wonderful night
4
Went to The Black Swan to celebrate my partner's birthday. I had made a reservation using Chope and we had seats next to the window. We would have preferred to sit on the sofa seat as it was cosier and more romantic there. I'm not too sure how the seating system works over there but perhaps making a reservation further in advance would help us in getting better seats.As we went on a weekday, there was some Happy Hour promotions going on between 5pm to 8pm or so and we ordered a dozen oysters at $2 each. The oysters which we got were rather small and I would strongly advise diners to splurge on the oyster selection on the main menu as those oysters would probably be of a better quality than the ones we had.We ordered the steak tartare and escargot for our appetisers. The steak tartare was average. While the meat definitely was of high quality, the bread which accompanied it was a little too charred on the edges and too crusty. The escargots which were stuffed with melt-in-your-mouth bone marrow was an exquisite delicacy. We would have ordered more if they weren't so pricey!For mains, we had the duck confit. It was tasty but it definitely wasn't the best duck confit which I have tried before. In fact, for that price, there are better options elsewhere. The duck confit came accompanied by a small piece of boudin noir (blood sausage) which was delicious and some porcini-braised shallots which were really aromatic. To end off our meal, we had The Black Swan Fireball. Doused in Grand Marnier before being set ablaze, The Black Swan Fireball was really a spectacle to behold, albeit a bit too sour for our liking. Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend diners to order this dessert just on account of the visual spectacle that comes with it
4
The Black Sean's interior has a hotel vibe and is ideal for dates or a classy night out with friends or family, food is priced slightly above average and quality is average! Still worth the visit because of the lovely interior aesthetic and great service staff! Super friendly and helpful :
4
Love the location and ambience, feels like such a romantic setting with its dim lights and cosy atmosphere. We had the Caesar salad - really good, pork chops - cooked just right. The sides of asparagus, brocollini and mushrooms were yummy. The only disappointment was the special of the day - T-Bone steak which was under seasoned. We had the Fireball and Gula Melaka cake for desserts; nothing to write home about..
5
Yes prices here are on the expensive side, but that's normal in this area.However, we visited on a Tuesday and were informed by the barman that their happy hour is 5 - 8pm every weekday. House wines at $9++ are very good and $2++ oysters are fantastic! Served with lemon, pepper, vinegar and tabasco :)Sitting at the bar, the staff were very attentive, especially Thomas.We had bar snacks...tender calamari with kaffir lime sauce, beef and chicken sliders..all tasty.Then upstairs for a mellow live band - currently playing every Tuesday (and $12++ selected cocktails till 9pm).Will be back :
4
We went on a Tuesday evening, 7pm and by 8 pm it was crowded.The restaurant was multi-level and located in an old building that used to be a bank; in fact the old bank vault is also a functioning private dining room for 12 pax.The clientele is decidedly young working professionals, and surprisingly more female than male. This was revealed to us by a staff member, when we inquired why the only two restrooms on the ground level are reserved for women. Men had to go to the next level upstairs, where there is also another restroom for ladies. The ambience was amazing; comfortable, smart casual, happy. Happy hours every Monday to Friday 5pm to 8pm, when fine-de-claire oysters from Britanny are $2 each, and table wines and beers are on specials too. For starters, we had a dozen oysters each and glasses of chardonnay.The service was excellent, very friendly and prompt. We were very pleased with Yang and Jonzen, who are sommeliers. For dinner, my partner had a wagyu ribeye (S$62) and 'happy hour' cabernet sauvignon. I had the special, dover sole meuniere (S$60) and 'happy hour' chardonnay. The ribeye was good however not meltingly good, but my dover sole was fantastic.For dessert we opted to share the black swan fireball (S$22), which is actually a frozen chocolate coated vanilla ice cream ball flambed by heated Cointreau. A real treat !!The meal came to be over $$300, which would be usual for a restaurant in the financial district
5
We visited The Black Swan for dinner on a Saturday night. The ambience was excellent, and our waiter was very attentive, courteous and knowledgeable of the menu. And even added a twist to the drinks we ordered - a gin martini and Old Fashioned. We ordered the whole lobster which was delicious, made extra special with the accompanying condiments. We also enjoyed the duck confit.Overall a tasty, comfortable, peaceful, well-delivered dinner
3
The location is at the heart of the financial district, nested in an interesting colonial building with unusually high ceiling. However, the acoustic is poor, service is causal, table is small and seating is too close that you can hear the next table's conversation loud and clear. No table cloth and cutleries are placed inside the table holder like a low end bistro, but the menu price is fine dinning level. For the oyster, they do not serve it with shallot or tobacco, just lemon and vinegar. It is sweet and fresh, but expensive $9++ per piece, just 8 pieces set us back by $85. Take note that they do not serve bread, and the steak DO NOT come with any sides dishes, nor a single strand of vegetable, just a piece of grilled garlic. The food taste fine, but it is poor value for money for the dinning experience. Be prepared to pay >$100 per head for a half full meal in a nosy place
3
Had we gone for lunch I would probably rated it 4 stars, but we went for dinner. Although we had reserved a table and had the misfortune to be sat between a noisy American couple and a group with a baby, and the two person tables are really close together.Interesting building and art deco grand bistro and bar. If you want a casual quick dinner and you are on an expense account you will probably like this place, which is a bar bistro serving food a fine dining prices. Steak main courses are around $ 60++ and then you may add another 20++ for side dishes is just too expensive even in Singapore. Oysters are 2-3 $ per pcs more expensive that elsewhere in Singapore. On a positive note all the food we had was well prepared, and the service was OK
5
Over all was excellent , Only if the table next to the kitchen celebration their birthday abit toooooo loud!
4
Well executed service and good food at the Black Swan. Outstanding service. Very good food. I would have liked if the lunch menu had more variety, but so far the food is done well
5
We came here for Valentine's Day 2017, they had a set menu consisted of oysters, t-bone steak, two sides and two free cocktails, this was under a hundred bucks, which is pretty good for downtown Singapore. The T-bone was one of the best steaks I have had. We made the mistake of getting a couple glasses of champagne and a delicious fudge dessert, which set us back a bit money wise. They gave you a free Polaroid of that night, which was a cute touch
4
The food was good and service was excellent. The oysters and lobster were very fresh. I celebrated my anniversary with my partner there and we had a great time. Will visit again!
4
Love the setting of the restaurant. Friendly service staff are always attentive. Food is fresh and delicious.Love their Original Classic Golden Parachute. Ask Thomas Tang to fix a glass as this drink cannot be found inthe menu (its different from Golden Parachute Cocktail
5
Visited there on Friday evening. Called to reserve a table about 3hrs in advance.I liked the dim light inside. Tall ceiling and hybrid style of a bar & restaurant. We had couple of drinks, bar snacks, appetizer & two mains. Highly satisfied with the food - taste, presentation & value for money.5* service - very professional & friendly.There is outdoor bar behind the restaurant & lounge bar upstairs, on 2nd floor.Crowd - young professionals from nearby office buildings, couples, groups of friends.Spent there about 3 hrs.Will definitely visit there again
5
A friend and colleague recommended I give it a try and so glad I did. Location is convenient, decor is decidedly art deco and beautifully done, happy hour drink menu is generous, and food menu is interesting. Finally found a decent hamburger in Singapore - not to be missed!
4
The atmosphere during lunch time is business casual; not the formal fine dining type. Quality of food is up to par, though not excellent
3
Before it became The Black Swan, it used to be a bar. And it still feels like a bar. The food is good but lacks the ambience to make this a great dining experience.
4
Good quality food, great ambiance - sort of being in a French brasserie with a strong Art Deco element
4
I nearly always have lunch in the Black Swan, when I visit Singapore. It is invariably good. I wil return again on my next trip.
3
The food was great. The steak was cooked perfectly. The Mac & Cheese tasted like a gourmet dish. However it was super expensive. I don't think it's worth spending that kind of money for what you get. I think it should be about 60% the prices
5
Had dinner here and great service, friendly staff and help with great recommendations, had their endive salad with blue cheese, shared a barramundi and veal chop, both was excellent!! Yang their managed recommend a Chardonnay which was truly well made and great value !! Will be back for sure, just for the veal chop & fire ball!!
4
Very attentive and friendly service. Excellent! Shared the sides of mushrooms and truffle mash, and had the duck confit with crispy quino
5
Place is good with a nice ambiance. The set dinner that we have order are reasonably good as well even though there are a huge crowd on Valentine's Day
5
Good atmosphere and excellent service from friendly and knowledgeable staff.Had a mix of Oysters to share which were excellent and steaks all round for the main course. All perfectly cooked. The wine list is extensive, if expensive, and was decanted and served throughout the meal.Very good experience definitely to be repeated on our next visit
2
I was pretty lost on Cecil Street, and was unable to find the restaurant. I managed to call in to the restaurant, and was surprised that they were unsure of their own locality. The staff was unfamiliar and advised me to use the Google Map, while the Manager, the Caucasian lady on duty in the evening (18/2/17 at 5.30pm), was more interest to hear her own voice on the phone than to find out where I was in order to guide me to the venue. In the end, I took another cab at Cecil Street to find No.19 Cecil Street. Sounds crazy isn't it? But, it damaged the total experience at the restaurant.The restaurant looked good, but there are hidden flaws. When asked where the washroom was, I was told that it is upstairs by the staircase; as if I know where is the stairway. I took issues with the washroom. One of the urinal to the right was choked; kind of reminded me of the toilets in the local foodcourts and coffeeshops. I was kind of shocked.Food-wise, overrated. We have the fish and burger. For the price, and brand perception, I expected more than ordinary.Perhaps the saving grace is the staff who served us. She was attentive, made recommendations, and anticipated our needs. If the two staff have done the same thing on the phone in guiding me to the restaurant, the overall rating would be higher.All in all, the restaurant is ordinary. Not sure if I would come back; definitely not to celebrate special occasions
4
Nice watering hole. My to go place. Prices are steep but go for the happy hour. It's amazing value ..
5
Went on a Thursday night. Was there at 615pm. It was happy hour time. Can order oysters for $2 each between 5-8pm. Really worth it. Ordered the Alaska snow crab salad with cut fruit. Was really refreshing. Had the black swan burger for main. The patty was really tender and juicy. Had the black swan fireball for dessert. It was a spectacular site watching the whole preparation of the dessert. The service was good and the hostess were very attentive. Good overall experience.
5
Booked the place for a business meeting. Good food and great ambience. would defo book this place for dining agai
2
The services staff is not friendly and the food tested and quality was not as myou last visit last year
2
Had hear that this place had an Art Deco vibe but on a visit late one afternoon it appeared to very minimalist. Everyone behind the bar appeared to be very busy. Maybe because the bar was empty there was no vibe so I have to take that into account.Popped upstairs to have a look at the famed lounge and it appeared to be hosting staff having a meeting. Then, on the way down, an odd thing happened: a male entered the female toilet. I presumed it might have been cleaning staff but shortly thereafter my other half went in.....to find two men washing in the Ladies. When she remonstrated with them, one merely laughed and cleared his throat loudly and voided the contents into the sink!Upon her return, we noticed another male enter the female toilets and that was when we decided to up sticks and leave
4
Classy place for drinks, with a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Stopped in with a couple of colleagues, and enjoyed a few hours of conversation and libations
3
Food was relatively pricey. Ordered aged angus prime, 1kg for family to share. BTW, that 1kg includes a large chunk of bone. Meat was nothing special, not tender. Side dishes were fine. Dessert, a modified tiramisu, lacking in alcohol and moistness. Atmosphere is good though. Can be a nice place for drinks
3
The food is ok. Oysters during the promotion period is cheap but not that fresh. The dessert fireball is quite unique thoug
5
We went for lunch and had the menu. Mine was an interesting play on duck, foie gras over a bed of corn followed by confit (duck, the duck's liver, and the duck's food). It looked like a fun place for dinner as well. Service was fast, efficient, and polite
3
The description and photos of this place sounded and looked so promising. The reality is some what different. Inside it looks and feels tired, it needs in my opinion some love.The meal itself and the staff were great although the wait time was a little long for my liking
5
Had steak for set lunch. Not bad.Chocolate Cake was nice. Think the set lunch prices are reasonable. Good place for business luncheons.Do Make Reservation for lunch.
4
Tried both the Kobe cusine and stockyard wagyu. Kobe cuisine was definitely better than stockyard. Shame that both the lobster mains and tapas wasn't available before 3pm
4
The set lunch is value for money in comfortable ambience. Must definitely order the date and toffee pudding for dessert. It's awesome'
4
The food was good and the service was excellent. I was Glad that the food came quickly. Very important for a work lunch.
4
Staff are attentive and constantly making sure you have what you need, reminded us of the last call for Happy Hour for the house-pours and oysters. The restaurant has a nice 1920s theme interior with high ceilings and dim lighting. Nice for romantic dates. Food was mediocre for the price. Nothing really special, which was disappointing after hearing good reviews from friends. Maybe it's the perfect place for some diners, but not for me
4
Their gillardeau, katama bay, and majestic oysters are so fresh! The pan-seared foie gras was nice too but the serving was very small. I highly recommend the pan-seared barramundi, but it is the stockyard Wagyu ribeye steak that is to-die-for. Will definitely be back for this steak super soon! PS: The sommelier who assisted us in selecting our red wine was also very good.
4
Great art-deco building, always full for lunch. Very nice crab salad. Simple menu, efficient service, great location. Only problem, you clothes stink food when you leave.
5
 My partner and I were absolutely pampered by the wide range of steak available. The Kobe Wagyu beef was an absolute stunner
4
We have our Christmas Eve dinner here. It was a great dinning experience. Environment and food is goo
4
The steak and sauces were delicious but the lobster tail was not fresh. The manager was so kind to take that off the bill. There were also Interesting pre-dinner cocktails
3
The Black Swan has been around for a few years, haven't been back in a while but this visit was a reminder of how lovely the environment is and how the food is consistently tasty
4
Usually patronize them in the evening. Nice charming place. Food is average. Service good. Typical corporate lunch
4
Good food, high prices, good ambience. If you are thinking of a place to charge to your company for a business lunch/dinner, this is the place to go (in cbd and not too loud). If you are looking for somewhere to eat at your own expense, you can find better value elsewhere
5
Been there with a friend for a quick drink during the week: lovely atmosphere, classy and nice service. I have been told it is very busy during weekend..
2
It is too noisy. Not value for money compared to other restaurants charging similar prices. Additional charge for bread and still water as wel
2
Was at the place for a business event. Experience was spoilt by the unfriendly, sour faced female service staff
3
Lunch was good until I got the bill. $10 for a glass of diet coke is unbelievable. It was the same price as a large bottle of mineral water
4
Have been dining at Black Swan for a couple of years and i must say that the standard of both the food and service has been very good! Especially the chocolate dome, it's a perfect sweet ending to the meal and it's my must-have on every visit
5
We had happy hours there. price of draft beer is very reasonable , only SGD 9 for 1 draft beer. bar food also tasted excellent. ambience is also very decent with very clean bathroom too. highly recommended the chicken drumsticks. the bar crews are also very friendly. will definitely visit black swan again.
5
Good atmosphere, service. Nice irish oysters. House pour Chardonnay was not that great. Little depth to it.
4
It's a great place for a special night out whether as a couple or with friends, though be prepared to pay a premium for it! Check out the menu on line to see if you're willing to pay the prices. The food was good but I thought the appearance was rather unsophisticated for the price. All said, the ambience including the soft lighting really adds to the special occasion. Just a small comment. While we were 3, I thought the couple tables could have been more creatively arranged. Rather than side by side which compromises privacy, they could be diagonally arranged so there is no complete overlap or configured more discretely.
3
I'd been here for lunch some 3 years ago and found it to be delightful - fabulous, innovative food and top service. So, I chose this for a wedding anniversary dinner. Should have known better. I did look at the menu and realised it had changed but stupidly assumed the service and quality would still be there.Nup.Overpriced gastropub food, at best. My duck confit was grey, and the blood sausage still had the plastic rim on it.My husband's steak was over cooked and the fries were underdone.The kitchen and staff seem to have a timing issue as well, with the charcuterie board (loaded with what looked like supermarket -quality sliced meats) arriving before my husband's pre-dinner cocktail (mine had arrived promptly). And the main meal was delivered before we'd finished our starters. We were finished in a little over an hour- hardly the leisurely, relaxed meal we were looking for.On the plus side, the Front-of-House seemed to be trying his best with inexperienced staff and the steak ( we later realised) had been removed from the bill.Not recommended for a special occasion
4
If you are looking for a unpretentious but definitely a fantastic meal in CBD area, you must try The Black Swan. This place has been around but I have always over looked choosing this place for a meal just because it is hidden corner tucked away from the hustle around and easily gets forgotten.And am I glad that I remembered this gem whilst having to plan birthday lunches recently.Am am I wowed by this place. From the wonderful well stocked old schooled bar to the yummy food served. This transports me back to the gentlemen club in London. Will definitely recommend to try out but do recommend that you book in advance as it is a very small establishment that gets booked out daily.
5
Will definitly come back again. It is nice to bring friend and business partner. Oyster will delicious too
4
Had lunch with a friend yesterday. We were pleased with the selection on the set lunch menu. And the $11 house wine pour was very nice. Service was attentive and the place was packed. I will go back!
2
We had high expectations as the venue is beautiful (although i didn't quite understand the ordinary bistro type tables and chairs in an art deco concept without proper table linen). We ordered a couple of starters and mains to share. Most of which turned out to be rather bland and uninteresting so I won't even bother going into details. At these prices we expected a lot more. The coffee was pretty good tough. The service was ordinary and slightly unattentive unless you made a specific request. They were friendly and helpful enough. But it was distracting to see them clustering in groups engaging in idle chit chat or staring at their phones. It was a Saturday night and there were probably only about 4 tables occupied at any point in time. It is really disappointing as there is a lot of potential for this restaurant to be great
4
Been there quite a couple times but the latest experience was not something to brag about. Dropped by on a Friday after working and it was kind of packed. Took a while for us to get attention of staff at the enterance though we had a reservation in place (lucky we did). Food was ok but on the pricey side. Nice service staff around. Alcoholic drinks could be better. Recommended to go upstairs at Powder Room for drinks instead though service was a disappointment. It was hard to get the staff attention though the place was not packed when we went upstairs. Overall experience was ok, but there're other better places in the CBD area.
5
Beautiful vintage classic restaurant, with great food, desserts and excellence service from the staff
4
Black Swan consistently has great lunch menu set but can be on the pricey side compared to other offerings in Singapore. The atmosphere and space however is welcoming. Service is ok
4
Food is really nice, and the service is good. They take initiative to help us to take the photo as wel
5
A most excellent place for lunch, slightly expensive, but excellent cooking for the price, quite good service, and they work hard to make their customers happy.
5
The place is conveniently situated at the heart of CBD. Restaurant looks really luxurious and swanky but homely at the same time. The outdoor dining area is my favourite place to enjoy my time there. The food is really okay price and the promotional items are the reason why I will be back soon.
5
This restaurant serves really great food. The desserts were fantastic. Try out during lunch hours for more value for money.
5
Head down for some drinks on a Friday night with colleagues for their happy hour promotions! Their service was impeccable just like the first time I went there for their set lunches.
4
The food was good and met our standards. I requested for a low seat and quite area and it was perfect for our business discussion. The service staff were very attentive and polite. My mentor said she would make a second visit.
5
Food at The Black Swan was excellent. Food was delicious and well executed, minor flaws aside. Service was friendly, warm and efficient.
4
Good spot for a business lunch. The menu hasn't seemingly changed much since the place opened, but they still do it well. I imagine some variation would encourage a regular, more frequent visit
3
Food and drinks were excellent. However, I can't say the same about the service unless you're white. We sat outdoor and trying to get a server to place our order was my biggest challenge. We told a manager (a white lady) that we would like to place an order and she told us to wait. Meanwhile, she went over to get orders from 2 not 1 other tables and what those 2 tables have in common...all customers were white. I am from Hong Kong and I was there to have drinks with clients and all were Chinese Singaporeans including myself. I never thought such reverse discrimination still happens in Singapore. I think the Singapore govt should consider revoking licenses of such places.
3
went here for my birthday dinner. the place has a good ambiance, but somehow i'm doubtful if i will come visit again. firstly upon ordering mains the waiter 'strongly suggested' appetizers since he mentioned that the lobster will take a while to be ready. the place is not cheap, so one would expect at least some bread and butter for while we wait for our food to arrive. none were served. the $60 grilled maine lobster looked unappetizing - they looked like they were just boiled and cut into half and hacked in the claws and put on a board. luckily the truffle mash was okay - which i had to pay extra for - as a replacement for fries. also during reservation my boyfriend mentioned that it was my birthday, and was hoping for at least a complimentary piece of cake or ice cream (again, food is not cheap, and most decent restaurants would gladly provide this) but the waiter came over and asked for dessert. we mentioned it is my birthday, and since there was a few seconds of dead air we already figured he had no plans of making me happy with a cake, so we decided to just order the fireball ($22). so while the place is okay, i have been to better places with better food at similar prices
3
With that price list you would expect to receive a certain standard of service. Instead it felt like a normal 2 stars restaurant. Not impressed at all. Food was ok. Not fantastic. Ambience is awesome. Music is a bit too loud.
4
A very popular lunch spot and after work drinking hole for the city executives working around the area. By 6pm, the place is packed and getting very lively. The attractions are the $2 oyster and one for one house drinks during happy hour. Food was quite good and had not disappoint. Service was prompt
3
This place is good for business lunch but is also good for dinner as well as drinks. You can book the top floor for functions also. I always have the steak tartar for lunch - why change a good thin
4
Impressed by the head water's attentiveness. I had requested the dessert to be decorated as a birthday surprise, & they did a beautiful job. Will return
4
Attentive service. Special arrangement for birthday celebration. Private and cosy yet a very friendly environment.
5
- Awesome service provided by waiters.- Good initiative by the restaurant to offer complimentary food when they made a mistake in food order.- Appreciate the effort to give a small surprise cake even though no request was made beforehand
2
We had a great evening since we were with friends - however. The starters and desserts were good - the main courses fell short of the mark, lukewarm and quite ordinary, not what we had expected and hence over priced. Unfortunately not one to return too.Go for the setting and the cool staff but be prepared to pay too much
4
A good central place to meet in Singapore. A short walk (100m) from the Talok Ayer MRT station.As you expect Black Swan offers a wide range of drinks.Appears to mostly cater to the business crowd from surrounding offices.Food is good pub food or mid range restaurant cuisine. Ranges from steaks (Singapore prices - S$40 for 200g - ouch!), duck, pork chop....you get the picture. Sides were good too - truffled chips (yum), greens etc.Wine list was appealing. Prices were usual for Singapore (minimum was S$60/btl).Service was attentive with useful offering of suggestions.I would go back

We had good food and enjoyed good service! Would definitely visit it again. Fireball dessert is amazing

As soon as you step into blackswan you'll feel like you've entered the set of the great Gatsby We came in waiting for Friends to arrive and so we decided to wait at the bar. My girlfriend who wasn't a big wine drinker asked for a recommendation and the bar staff were very helpful and recommended a really nice wine. They even offered some to try before ordering.For food we had some lobster crisp and fried calamari as starters. The lobster crisp is a interesting mix of rice paper infused with grind lobster, an excellent snack to go with drinks. Service is excellent, there was no moment that our glasses were empty. Staff will check in to see if everything is ok. Just the the right amount not too intrusive just enough for us to have enough privacy. I would recommend this place for any dinner functions or drinks.

Came back here again for dinner again with the family. Food was fantastic so was the services. Rachel and Johnson took great care of us. We were very impressed with the manager Carol too. She came by a few times to make sure that everything was alright.
3
Came here with my friend for lunch so ordered the set lunches which looked decently priced, until we asked for bread and were told that we had to pay extra. If you were to add in the price of the bread, you could go to a higher end restaurant so we decided to skip the bread. The food was okay, main highlight was the chic dÃ©cor

Decided to make a reservation for lunch last week to meet up with friends/colleagues. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. Food was good too. Had their set lunch and loved the desserts especially. Heard their oysters are good. Definitely going back there, but occasionally. :
5
The Black Swan is a must do location for an serious lunchers, diners or cocktailers. For lunch we both had the West Australian octopus salad and beef cheeks. The salad was a little disappointing but ok. The beef cheeks, which came with creamy mash and some other vegetables was a real treat. Finished off with an excellent Melbourne style latte. All on the fixed lunch for S$42.00 definitely value for money. Staff were great, atmosphere also great, Will definitely be back
3
First impression of The Black Swan when you enter is the wow factor. The interiors are reminiscent of 1930s art deco style decor, with lots of brass details and warm lighting. We came for the prix fixe lunch menu. My colleague had the gazpacho soup, and barramundi, which she said was excellent. I started with the radish and endive salad, which came out as a mixed green salad (no endives) with only 1 1/4 walnut bits in it followed by the Black Swan burger. The salad was still good even though it didn't have endives and just one walnut. The burger was nothing to rave about. Not sure I'll be back for lunch, but I'll definitely come back to try the happy hour oysters and cocktails. With an ambiance like this, I'm willing to give it another go
4
Nice Art Deco building so very nice. Good lunch time crowd. Set lunch but we ordered from the menu. Food was not bad. Definitely good place for happy hour drinks.

I have heard much of this place and decided for once to try out this place. It was a Friday night and they had an event upstairs, hence we were seated at the first floor. It was quite noisy with The Powder Room just across, packed with mostly business associates.We ordered two cocktails which took more than twenty minutes to arrive, long after the appetisers were served! It was understandable that it was a busy night but the wait was too long! The Play with Fire cocktail, especially, was an interesting drink served on fire; warm and strong. Even when the appetisers were served, the napkins weren't open for us. We had the escargots, charcuterie and two Joshu Wagyu as part of the friday specials. The escargots stuffed with the melt-in-the-mouth bone marrow was absolutely divine. The server however, missed one of our order for the Joshu waygu. Only one arrived and we had to wait for the other to be served before we could start our meal together. The wagyu could have been a bit more tender too.The third cocktail we ordered was the BB King. Very unique presentation with a sorbet on cone by the side. I loved the flavors altogether. Overall, it would have been a better experience should the drinks and food be served promptly and should we be seated in a quieter environment. Service were friendly but could have been more attentive. The bill came up to SGD300 plus for two, unless there are improvements made on days that are such busy, there are other establishments more valuable and comfortable than this

A pretty nice dinner on Monday Evening. The crews were attentive, dinner was great.We went there for a friend's birthday and the crew offered the complimentary cake of the day. Good Gesture.Good to catch their happy hours if you like French oysters at $2++We had a great dinner.Thank you Team at TBS
5
Was here last monday for a couple of drinks and bar snacks after a long day at work. Decent ambience, coupled with good music. Food/drinks are on the pricier side compared to other restaurants. Enjoyable evening due to the service provided by the waiter on duty. Waiter displayed commendable service by being courteous and prompt. His name was "ming" if i recall correctly( No name tags)

Had actually sent them the below via email as feedback but, their email address is down. Decided to share this on tripadvisor then. I've been patronizing Black Swan since 2014 and what makes me return is the consistent quality of food and service. Today was the 1st time that i experienced a different dining experience. Service1) when shown to our table, staff did not pull out the seat for me (i'm sure you'd agree that even staff from mass restaurants e.g. Ichiban, swensens pull the seat for the female guest)2) staff did not offer to place the napkin on my lap3) the reservation card wasn't taken away from the table4) when the bill was given to my partner, typically the pen would be ready and after signing the bill, the staff would pass the diner's copy and card to the customer. This did not happen on this visit.Food: 1) i ordered my usual choice, barramundi. Previously the dish would be served with this thin cracker-like garnish, but this time there wasn't any. The papaya and pineapple salsa used to be light and appetizing, today's was more spicy and oily than usual. Barramundi was also slightly firmer than usual, probably overcooked.2) chocolate dome. We never fail to order this dessert and we were initially impressed that it was served almost immediately after our mains were cleared. I later realized the cake seemed to have somewhat melted and started to "sweat", and the plate wasnt cold (it usually is). Probably it was prepared and left outside while waiting for the mains to be cleared, which obviously shouldn't be the case.I'm not particular about all the above, some doesn't even matter to me eg the napkin. However, i wanted to highlight the number of differences that i have encountered this evening, compared to the past dining experiences
4
Located in one of the last surviving pre war buildings near Raffles Place, this place has a nice buzz from around 5pm till early evening.Good selection of spirits, wines and cocktails but limited selection of beers on offer.You will need deep pockets either way.Probably best to avoid the happy hour oysters on offer as I've seen more meat on a Butchers penci
2
Table of 4 with booking on a Tuesday. We came for the oyster happy hour --> oysters were sold out. Then during dinner: We ordered first bottle of wine. Waiter said ok. He came back after 5 minutes saying it was sold out. We ordered a different wine from the expensive wine list. Waiter said ok again. He came back again 5 minutes later saying it was also sold out! We then learnt that the 4 less expensive wines were all sold out!! We finally ordered a third bottle, a 2010 Saint Joseph. The waiter came back after 5 more minutes with a 2013 bottle... This is unacceptable considering the price paid. Food is average. Place is nice and lively but definitely not recommend the place to anyone. Big disappointment.
5
Had a wonderful dinner with a Friend from oversea! Was recommended to try the crab salad which was refreshing, their steak tartare is favor full, escargot nicely done and for mains we had the pork chop- nicely cooked and succulent and juicy. We had the haricot bean and artichoke which are both cooked just right! Overall an enjoyable meal with the right price!! Will be back again!
1
We visited on the 25/5/16. No complimentary bread on arrival. They got the oyster order wrong, we asked for cooked oysters and we got raw oysters so they had to be sent back and replaced, the second dish was a crab salad which was the best dish (but suppose its hard to get a salad wrong) but even that was mostly salad leaves and not much crab and the tiny bit of crab which was there was full of shell. The two main courses were poor quality, the Oxtail Special was mostly bone and very fatty and an odd flavour sauce, the pork dish was under done and bland, the side of fries/chips were from frozen and totally tasteless, how hard is it for a restaurant to cook fresh fries/chips? it must the one of the easiest things to cook but this restaurant is too lazy to cook make them. The tables are very close together, so you can't have a private conversation and have to squeeze past the table next to you to get out (i'm slim). No compensation for the complaint we made about the crab shell in the salad and no apology. We didn't get offered dessert. We paid (220sgd) and the plates of half eaten food were still on the table as we left and no one even asked us if we enjoyed our food. we gave this place 2/10 which was for the ambience and the 3 drinks we had. Don't waste your money going here there are much better places to go
5
perfect location for a lunch in the CBD area. love the food and the location.
furthermore, great for drinks after work as well
5
My partner and I had lunch on a Monday and although busy and the location is in CBD, the staffs manage to accomodate every guests on the table. Rachel, our server, was prompt and attentive. We ordered seared foie gras for appy, iberico pork, and duck confit as mains and these dishes were great. Will definitely return here for more
2
The beef cheeks were unseasoned and the gravy tasted like it came out of a package. The waiter raved about their carrot cake. It was probably the worst carrot cake I've ever had! We ate at the Pollen the day before. Their set lunch was only $7 more and the food and service was superb! We felt gutted that we chose this place over Gordon Ramsey's Bread Street. The chairs are peeling, the bathroom was dirty, the walls are full of dust and the service just so-so. I will not go back here and do not recommend it. There's too many other places that offer excellent set lunches for around the same price
4
Previously, 2 course cost over SGD30++ and now prices went up to SGD42++. 3 courses same at SGD$48++. One to two main courses changed. New addition is beef cheek as i had it. Very tender and juicy, slightly fatty but overall great. Love their desserts so go for it! Sticky date toffee pudding is my favourite as well as chocolate dome
3
cool place in downtown located in a very nice building. easily accessible. nice to just have a drink and chill. sit at the bar and people watch. the only gripe i have is that the font size on the food menu is kind of small. i actually had my partner read the menu aloud.. no kidding. the oysters from ireland (happy hour deal) we had were unfortunately even tinier than the font size and alas, that was not what we had expected. the fries and the slidders were ok. but i guess going there for food isn't what people do. service is pretty decent. friendly staff.
5
Close to my workplace and described out in Art Deco, The Black Swan is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. I've tried most things on the menu and recommend the crostinis, Alaskan snow crab salad, the "house" hamburgers, linguine vongole and pretty much all the desserts. Excellent waiting staff and a great place to dine in Singapore.
3
I had wanted to come to this CBD restaurant for some months, but the thought of battling the office crowd at lunchtime held me back. The decision to visit for the first time was made easier as it was a Monday which meant its sister restaurant, the White Rabbit at the Dempsey area and my preferred choice, was closed. The Black Swan has character - the building and interior were interesting, a former bank building with high ceilings and an Art Deco feel. It had a nice, lively vibe. Service was good. But the food at lunch was surprisingly disappointing. The crab salad was sort of dry and short of crab with the salad leaves so underdressed that I felt I was eating a live plant, my beef cheek was bland, my guest left two thirds of his pasta untouched. The restaurant was respectably and moderately full with the regular office crowd, so I would guess the food is generally better than what I had. Now that my curiosity is satisfied, I won't be bothering to go back there in a hurry though
5
I was there last week for dinner on a saturday and it was a great experience, especially the food was delicious and the service was extremely good. The staffs were readily replying my questions and recommendations. Especially a bubbly girl with a samurai ponytail was funny and polite. we enjoyed the ambience, cocktails and food we will definitely go back agai
5
I have been here twice now. The place has a lovely atmosphere and allows you to forget you're in Singapore for the moment - you could actually be in the middle of Australia somewhere. The 3-course lunch was served at a very good pace - indicative of the attentiveness of the wait staff. The second occasion was my birthday, and our table's waiter was so kind - he got a candle for my slice of cake and also a birthday gift for my next visit. All around a very lovely place to go to for business and personal lunches in the CBD
5
Lovely place with nice ambience, great to dine and chill with friends. Their burgers are a must try. Fun loving service staffs. Overall a great experience, will definitely go back again
4
A good place to go for dinner/drinks after work..Good ambience .Service was good and staff were friendly. The happy hour oyster is worth the price. Had escargot,bone marrow crostini and steak tartare...recommend steak tartare if looking for something special..ordered the daily special lamb culet as main..Its tender and fragrance..Lastly had a date and toffee pudding..It was awesome...Had a lovely and enjoyable evening..And will return again to try more food
2
We here for lunch at 13:00 on Friday. Understand that quite busy but most of table already had their food so we order and still have to wait for 35 minutes for food to come and it come without cutleries and that add another 10 minutes as most of staffs are busy with taking care empty table. Burger is nice even tho it not hot I mean cheese not even a bit in heat, I still can break cheddar cheese slide.
4
Good ambience in a beautiful historic setting. Decent food with gastro pub type dishes. Our food was good. Wine list needs some work. No white burgundy and limited decent red too. Will return
4
The Black Swan is a great place to go for after work drinks or drinks with friends. a great selection of whiskies and wines, a great menu some very good after work specials. The place has a great feel to it beautiful bar in the middle and the service is excellent. Give this one a try for an old school gin and tonic or a new age cocktail. Enjoy
4
Service was good and friendly. Also, food was served in generous portions. It was a lovely dining experience in all
4
High quality cross over pub slash restaurant in fantastic art deco building. The burger is a stand out. The bar tender makes a mean Martini.
4
I dined with here with my colleagues for Friday lunch, fortunately they were paying. The restaurant is art deco style, bustling with other patrons and a nice atmosphere for lunch, dinner or drinks. I ordered a glass of rose (I don't know how to make an accent on the e) and the steak tartare - which is a small plate. The service was a little slow, but I think they were just really busy so they could do with additional staff. The steak tartare was great! Highly recommended! If my lunch break wasn't limited I would have stayed all afternoon and ordered a bottle of the rose. Oh and they do a oyster happy hour each day, $2.00 per oyster. Will definitely come back
3
We tried the set lunch at this restaurant. Quite ok and service was fast. Good ambiance too. The only complaint I have is the floor mat at the entrance, it's dirty and disgusting.
5
Excellent restuarent with exceptional service. Looks like something out of the Great Gatsby or Bioshock.Their happy hour(till 8pm) oysters are 2 sing dollars each and pints of stella artois go for 11 sing dollars.The rare waygu steak I ordered was cooked nicely and still retained that melt in your mouth quality without the taste of blood. Highly recommend!Try their cocktails, the bartender(Royce) was very skilled and served me personally with his wonderfully crafted "Old Fashioned". The "fountain of youth" cocktail was incredibly smooth yet still had that subtle kick that gin has.Their desserts are also awesome. Try the Black Swan bomb. Flaming choclated covered icw cream is both fun and delicious!The service staff were very attentive as well and snapped/provided a polaroid photo of me and my girl friend free of charge.Truly a most enjoyable evenin
4
A cool place to chill out after work. The restaurant is centrally located along Cecil street and collier quay. The service is good and embience is very English vintage.
5
Good food with great ambience. Suitable for celebrations or dates! We went there for my gf's hens night, and we had a really great time. Service is fantastic.
4
Great ambience. Accessible location. Hard to miss the sign board. This is superbly annoying review..
4
Ordered the barramudi which is tender though papaya and apple salad is sour, duck confit can be more tender but the quinoa is really crispy and addictive. Must order the foie gras small main n fireball dessert
4
The service is excellent. I booked a table for 4 initially but ended with 5 pax instead. They were fully booked but the staff was very helpful to help me make arrangements so that we can have a side table so we can add a chair. Food was good. We tried everything on their lunch menu and it was good. A tad expensive but for the environment and services, it was worth it.
5
spent my afternoon over some assorted high tea set at the black swan, totally enjoyed the ambience and relaxed setting. service was good without being intrusive.. i saw myself humming to the music of the restaurant.. awesome catchup with friends and stayed all the way till 6pm. will return to try out lunch someday soon
2
We came here for an afterwork party with work. Beter to avoid this bar. It's very dirty and there is a smell of day after alcohol in the air. Last time for us.
2
We purchased two tickets for the Jingles & Jazz show. We love jazz and I thought it would be a great way to kick off the holiday season. The band was good, but we didn't have the opportunity to enjoy. We arrived before the show began and it was standing room only. Fine, except this is not a very good venue to stand in because there is a huge column in the middle of the room. Another patron was very angry no seats were available (and that the drink coupons -- we paid $28 per head -- couldn't be used for seemingly standard cocktails), and was able to secure some seats for him and his date. The manager saw that we had overheard this conversation, and got us bar stools as well. We appreciated this gesture; however, there was no good place to place these stools and we were basically just standing in the pathway of every guest that entered, and the wait staff. The room was nearly packed when we arrived, and people were streaming in afterwards, so this venue was completely over-sold. With most patrons blocking our view either staring at their phones or shouting over the music, we were miserable and left after 20 minutes. We had pleasant drinks at the Black Swan once before and I've always wanted to return either for dinner or to catch some jazz, but this experience was a complete fail. We'll definitely not be back and don't recommend at all. If you want to catch some jazz in Singapore go to Singjazz
4
Right at the heart of CBD, The Black Swan is a great place for business lunch. I was there with my colleagues, place is packed, so I would recommend a reservation. Ordered a set lunch of Alaska Snow Crab Salads and Barramundi, of which the salads was a little shy of crab meat but the Barramundi was well prepared
5
Celebrated friend's birthday. Good Food. Attentive and very hospitable staff. Excellent service. So much so, we went that same day for drinks. It was crowded and it took a little longer for our drinks to arrive. However, we were pleasantly surprised to have a mushroom loaded bruschetta on the house. Will be definitely going back there
5
Service staff was warm and very nice. Thou I look young they served me no different from the table next to us. Food came nice and hot. There food was impeccable. Their wagyu rib eye steak was better than Mortan's and Sear's, I dare say. In terms of price i would say it is pricey but definitely worth it for occasions. And they gave my wife a beautiful set of small gifts from YSL.
4
Good food and atmosphere. Slightly on the expensive side for the quality of food. Highly competitive corporate lunch crowd.
4
Attentive servers, good food, reasonable price. Ordered 2 sides 2 mains and some wine at happy hour price. Bill came up to $190 for 2 pax. Restaurant was surprisingly not full on a Friday evening.
5
Service was excellent. Celebrated my friend's birthday there. They took a Polaroid for us, allowed us to cut cake that we brought and even had a gift for my friend. Love it
3
The food was average here, but presented nicely. I can't say I was a fan of the house wine that was offered during the happy hour special. The venue is a bit noisy as well with the ceilings and music, but that allows for privacy between the rather closely packed tables. The open kitchen is a nice touch
3
The Black Swan is an art deco style bar and restaurant just off Market Street near the Telok Ayer markets. It's popular with the finance district crowd; there's an excellent whisky list and the focus seems to be more on the drinks than the food, which I found to be a bit average in quality and presentation. There were only one or two vegetarian options available for me so my choices for dining were limited. Service was a bit brusque with not much interaction between staff and customers. It's worth stopping by for a drink at the bar to admire the décor if you're in the area, but there are far, far better dining options nearby
5
It's my second visit back, food and service was wonderful! Thank you for the gift and polaroid for my mom! 
2
The place was noisy, The food was fairly good.We ordered a bottle of wine. The first round was served from the bottle. The bottle was then taken away. When it came back for topping up, the wine was in a decanter. The wine was decanted without our knowledge nor our approval! To me the wine before decanting tasted better. I couldn't help wondering for the rest of the evening if I was having the same wine that I had ordered. Perhaps the service staff should take a lesson in Wine Serving 101
5
It was my hubby's birthday and I have dated him there for a nice and tasty dinner. The food are fantastic, portion is just nice and dessert is marvellous.I had the fireball dessert, it was served with flames! The duck leg confit is crispy and complement well with the sweet sauce provided. The grilled pork chop is definitely a best choice to go for if you love meat!This was definitely a memorable experience to me! See my attached picture for the flaming fireball..
4
Food are a tat expensive but service staff constantly checked in on us, which is not very common in Singapore's dining scene. The kitchen messed up our orders and we received a complimentary dessert, albeit it being a joking request by my colleague. A shoutout to Andrea for her great service! With a 1930's Jazz age theme, I was expecting the ambience of the restaurant to be darker though
3
Food is nice but portion was really small for its price. Waiters were quite attentive. Please don't clean your aircon vent whilst customers are dining its very unsightly and unhygenic. Also we can see staff being trained and rated 2 tables away. It's very distracting to other diners. My plate could even spin 360 degree while i was trying to cut my steak. All these shouldnt be happening in a posh restaurant. I think its not worth the amount spent having all those encounters above
5
Had the Stockyard Australia Wagyu Ribeye Steak for 2, half dozen escargot and duck leg confit. Excellent quality and certainly excellent service.
3
This place is nice... Food is fine and overall ambience is above average.. Price is a little on the high side, can come again...
5
Was kindly greeted and escorted to our seats. The ambience of the place is very nice and the staff is very quick to response to you when you need any service. The food is nice.
5
Food was good and they have many variety.
Drinks was at power room which was relaxing with good music.
4
One of the best I've been in Singapore! Will definitely be back for more! The Barramundi could be more though :)
5
I have been here several times now and the food here is simply amazing. Great food in great value. The cosy and laid back feel makes a great place for chillout with friends.
4
Enjoyed a very good meal with excellent service, it gets a bit noisy once the restaurant is full. Like most places in Singapore the coffee quality is so so.
3
This place is nice, just not a 'destination restaurant'. The ambience is fine and the service is ok, not fantastic. It's good for a meal or a drink in the CBD, but I wouldn't bother going if you're not nearby anyway. The burger is a good burger, but it is still a burger, otherwise the food is fine, just not spectacular. The best part about this place is the cocktails, although they are expensive
5
Started off with bone marrow, mushroom bruschetta and Caesar salad, you can't go wrong with these choices.Our table had wagyu ribeye, beef burger and pork chops. am not a fan of pork, but my friend gave me a piece to try, it was incredible! It was so succulent and tasty, that I asked for another nibble. The other mains were great as well.End the night with their flaming choco sphere dessert, definitely a showpiece.The two service staff were excellent, the lady in the blue dress was all smiles and efficient, while the male server was very knowledgeable and gave good recommendations on the menu.Will definitely return
3
Decor is stylish and interior is clean. Slightly art-deco, which makes it very agreeable.Food is slightly overpriced with not many vegetarian options for my colleagues/clients. it is fine for a decent European-style business lunch, but would not go out of my way to go there again
5
The lunch special at Blackswan is a great value and ideal for a quick business meeting.
The burgers are great. Of course all the other dishes are perfect for a set business lunch.
a glass of wine is well priced too.
2
There is hair in the octopus, service is slow, ox cheek is to greasy and tasteless luck warm. Profiteral pastry is bad too.
and it's way to
Did they change the chef recently or what?
3
Normal frontline service for the price of food served.
Satisfactory 1st time experience at Blck Swan
4
I visited The black Swan for drinks with my wife and had a very pleasant time. it's a lively bar, great atmosphere and attentive staff. Had a couple of glasses of wine and some oysters and generally enjoyed myself.
Worth a visit.
5
Dine at the restaurant at tuesday night.Place was pack and it gives a gabsty feel with the restaurant interior design.Its a french restaurant with a bar.Place was very cosy and we felt comfortable.we were well greated by the front host.The dining staff were patient in explaining the food menu and answer all our enquries and gave us some good recommendation.service by the dinning staff were great.Plates were cleared once food were finished and ice water are always topped.We had the suckling pig.It was awesome.Tender and juicy with the crunchy skin.Its a must to order if dining with group of people.we also ordered the foie gras ,cripsy calamari and hamachi raw fish.We love all the dishes.The time for the food to be serve were fast after we ordered.The dinning stuff were always be around to serve is and others.Overall we were happy with the food and service.Price were reasonable and near to the Mrt station..will be back again to try more dish
5
Definitely a place we'd return to again! An unexpected great find - everything from food, cocktails, ambience to service was great for me and my girlfriends. We love especially the cocktails there at the powder room - thanks to Gerardo the friendly bar manager. Highly recommended if you're at the CBD area
3
Three important things went wrong. 1. Food: I ordered the Grilled Iberian Pork Chop. Tasty and well presented, but some parts were pink and undercooked. Unacceptable. 2. Ambience: We arrived at 8pm. The restaurant was extremely noisy, which was not what I was expecting. My partner and I were practically shouting throughout our entire conversation. 3. Service: Slow. We had to request for the bill twice. Overall, not worth the price tag. Unlikely to return.
3
Had to try very hard to get the attention of the staff throughout my meal, to ask for water (including refilling) and place our orders. The place is also noisy and I had to strain to hear what my friends were saying.
4
Atmosphere: My team went down for lunch at 11.40am to 1pm. It was a quiet and classy affair. Love the exterior facade and the art decor influence. Sat on the high tools which was fine for the gentlemen and ladies in pants, not sure about those in dresses/skirts. Food: Some took the 2 course lunch for 38++ but I went for the duck confit for 37. The duck was fantastic and the fact that quinoa was used thus making it gluten free was such a relief for me. My colleagues enjoyed the Chilled Gazpacho - it came with a surprise gelato in it. They also liked the Pan-Roasted Barramundi, Linguine Vongole and Dark Chocolate Dome they ordered. Great food and environment. Just wished the prices were a little less steep!Service: Service was ok except one point in time when the waiter nearly spilled tomato soup on my colleague as he let the glass bowl slide across the wooden serving tray. Thankfully her white jacket was intact
2
I had little flies that settled on my dish. This was the second time I went there for lunch. My 1st experience was the vongole was too salty. But they replaced my order, so it was fine. However, there were also small flies hovering my plate (1 or 2). The service was not very good. Water was not refilled. Also, I requested for warm water which I thought the waiter indicated it by flipping the coaster over which we thought it was a smart idea. But he did not come back with my request. When I requested for water again from another waiter, she gave me cold water..
4
Great lobster, the service is surprisingly fast. The duck confit parpadelle and black iced lemon tea are also good.
5
Great simple food, ideal for business lunch in a relaxed atmosphere. Menu is simple, service is good and food is delicious.
4
Quaint, exclusive restaurant serving nice food at the Quadrant in the middle of the busy business district of Singapore. Great place to catch a set lunch or set dinner, either for business or for casual
3
Have been twice in a week. Both experiences were average. Food can be considered as OK but service does not work. While we had ordered, 2 other waiters came to ask for our order,same for the bill. While things were missing with our meals, we had to request 2x to bring the missing parts. Usual answer was, "really sorry" but who cares. Overall, very pricy for what we got but in the end, in the CBD, high rent and always struggling to find good personnel
4
We found this merely by walking by. The atmosphere is quite lively and loud which normally would have us leave immediately. We are glad we stayed. We were well taken care of and enjoyed every dish - they do bring all of them out at once which was unexpected. The decor/architecture is unique in Singapore. The servers authentically wanted to serve us !!
4
We had the calamari and softshell crab mini burgers. They were really small portions just nice for two of us. Batter used for both were the same though. for variety, You Might like to try the cajun chicken. All drinks were great.They open till late. Dj at powder room where its crowded, if you prefer slightly quieter environment, black swan downstairs might suit better
4
The food was very good. Burgers looked amazing by went for the lovely beef cheeks followed by the must try "chocolate dome". They do not get 5 blobs as the waiter staff always seems over worked and not very attentive and the restaurant is fairly noisy.
4
Great place with art deco style all over it and a very nice setting. We had the set lunch and food was really good and came in perfect time as lunches have to be fast. A bit to the high price side for what the food portions were but very in line with same category lunch prices in the CB
4
Went here with the family and had a great dinner. The steak was amazing and the foie gras was impeccable.. I mean seriously the best I've ever had. I want to go back just to order it!!! I would recommend the Black Swan to anyone that wants a great dinner on a nice night out

Black swan is a busy lunchtime joint in the CBD in Singapore. It is in a great location and I'm sure that it the main reason for its success. We had a business lunch there where the food was ok but very overpriced. They charge a lot for drinks and extras and so the set lunch cost almost doubles in price. Starters were small but adequate. My steak tartare lacked spice. Burger for main course was ok but given the price expected something better. There are many better lunch choices close by.
4
Nice look and ambience! Warm and energetic.
Food was good even if not very creative. Champagne not great. Quality Cost ratio ok
5
Costly Place to be & but very nice place
very good service & all are very kind & helpful
suggest to be there at least once when in Singapore
5
Loved the ambience, lovely staff and their attention to detail while being very friendly and professional. We enjoyed the cocktails -try the Fountain of Youth! The food was lovely and overall we lived the Black Swan 😀
4
Went black swan for the first time with my friend for late dinner. Awesome place to chill out, with awesome food and drinks! Never knew a place like Powder Room have this magic of making me wanting to return for more!
5
Great food and efficient service - all 4 picked the set and a side order of bread - oh, the butter toasted baguette with simple olive oil & balsamic was a winner - salads and all mains were good - linguine, duck confit, fish but best was the burger with its fries - awesome dark choc dome (valrhona guanaja & berries) to conclude my meal. Special mention of servicers who unobstrusively refilled our water glasses 4 times - during peak lunch hour - commendable. Will return
5
Probably my 4th time here, finally decided to review the place. When for the 2 course set lunch for 2 which set us back S$109 all in (including coffee). The farmer's salad is one of my favorites and the steak as well as the burger are recommended. Will be back, very good ambiance and servic
4
Went there twice for business lunch and like the ambience of the restaurant. The set lunches are well priced and food is good too. I have tried the duck confit and seafood pasta which the latter tasted a bit blend. Overall good place for catchup. They have also started a tea time special from 2-5pm
4
I went there for a business lunch. Everything was fine. The place had a good atmosphere and was lively. The staff was professional, smiled and efficient. They seemed well trained. Food was good. Nothing too complicated, but well prepared and served rapidly. I would recommend this place
4
My first visit to The Black Swan after hearing many good things about the restaurant. I ordered the 2-course set lunch (38++)- Crab Salad (+4) and the The Black Swan Burger. The salad was excellent - fresh greens, good chunks of crab meat and an awesome citrus vinaigrette. For the main course, (I am not a burger person) the burger was AMAZING. I truly enjoyed each bite and would go back again for the burger.The restaurant was extremely crowded during a Friday lunch (so much so it was actually hard to talk with my fellow diner) so reservations are a MUST
5
went to the black swan twice, stayed at The Powder Room. here you can totally enjoy those amazing cocktails from menu or ask bartender to make a special cocktail which not on the menu [bartender Gerardo was make a special drink for my friend, i can tell it was really yum.. sweet n' sour taste.me and my friends had a very good time here, good music n' relax after a long day work. and staffs here also friendly n' nice!! deffo will like to visit more times
5
Was at powder room last nite. Is a hide away from our busy working life. The awesome vocal form the band blend well with the cocktail. It the best way to end my busy day. Is a must visit place on my chill out list
4
Go to The Black Swan. Been here for drinks at the bar, dinners with friends, dates, and New Year's Eve. All good experiences. Food is decent and the heritage 1930's ambience makes it a pleasant experience.
2
The Usher didn't bother to check my reservation which was made more than 3 weeks earlier and ushered us to a table which I dislike. She refused to move us to the table I desired and said the arrangement was already made. The restaurant was only half filled. Our wine glasses were only filled once at the time the bottle was open. The glasses were never filled since then. Even the manager just came by, looked at the table, and left without giving any service. Frankly, the Usher and the Manager are redundant
5
crazy infused cocktails with the state of the art decor.. A must for everyone .. For couples, it's a perfect romantic date night.Or a few friends could have a great night with a few nibbles ..Or you could go solo.. Sit by the bar, get your customized drinks and chat with the friendly staff..A check on every mark, hitting the right spots right in the heart of the CBD area.Can't wait to try their new menu.

The Black Swan is situated in an art deco building in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD), a distinctive building that has changed hands a few times, including having housed the exclusive all-females only W Law Firm some years back. The cafe, restaurant and bar concept evolves around muted gold settings, giving the place a sophisticated feel; they serve European classics dishes.For starters, we had the Farmer's Salad, comprising of arugula, apple, celery, red onions, walnuts, cranberries, Fourme d'Ambert and balsamic vinaigrette. The lightly-tossed salad was devoid of sauces, so it was light, crispy and refreshing with rocket leaves and dices of cheese. It was a lovely starter.I chose the Pan Roasted Red Snapper with egg sauce and leeks two ways. The snapper was pan-roasted to a crackling texture, peaking its texture and flavour. The creamy egg sauce gave the crispy fish a smoother edge, making for a sumptuous dish.Finally, we concluded the meal with Dark Chocolate Dome. The beautiful cake had a glossy, sticky layering of dark chocolate, and a soft chocolatey interior with a vanilla heart. It was saccharine without being overly sweet, bringing out the richness of chocolate very well. The velvety texture melted easily in the mouth as well.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/lunch-at-black-swan-raffles-place.htm

Came here for lunch today and opted for the set menu of 3 courses, priced at $44++ plus extra for some dishes. I had the foie gras for starters (+$6++) followed by the red snapper and the chocolate dome cake, all of which were very good. I was a little disappointed that the snapper was only a small piece and there were no sides (and so I ended up slightly hungry at the end of the meal). There was also no bread served and service could have been a little more enthusiastic. But the quality of the food made up for it and overall this was a good meal. I got the impression that most people were there for business lunches

@TheKuoKnows If you are willing to accept The Black Swan for what it is - a gastropub - then you won't go too far wrong. I did and I am not at all disappointed.The Black Swan probably flips one of the best hamburgers in Singapore. At S$30 a pop, it is not cheap, though. But it is, nevertheless, one of the cheapest main course items on the a la carte menu.The Black Swan Burger is a meal in itself, and more. You probably won't need a starter, and you most likely won't need a dessert unless you have the apetite of a caveman.Would I go back? Unquestionably yes, once my digestive system has processed the chuck-steak patty, the mature chedar, the streaky bacon, the lashings of crunchy chips and the sunny-side-up egg that was cooked to oozing perfection.
4
I went there with friends thinking it was a bar with only finger foods. What a nice surprise . The food is very classy, tasty, fresh and delicious!! Cocktails are a must try as well. The service was friendly and the atmosphere FB. Would defo go back soon!
3
We arrived on time at 7pm as part of a group of 30-40 people. We had to fill in a form with our main course order. Our table was the first to arrive and the last to be served after 8:30pm. We were offered wine very quickly but had to wait ages for iced water. The food was OK, but the confit duck tasted more like roast duck. Side vegetables were very good. The service to get the bill was also not happening. I understand that a big group is not easy to deal with, but we did order very early - others arrived much later and were served first
3
Lovely setting and excellent food that you would expect for the price paid. The start of the meal was tarnished with poor service -- a male waiter started pouring still bottled water which we didn't order and when we pointed that out, he didn't apologize (or smile even once during the whole time we were there) and glared at us rudely and proceeded to instruct another waitress to clear the glasses of water. Expected a higher level of service considering the high end establishment
5
Been here almost every week for business lunches since I discovered this place. Good variety of food, great service, easy and super quick online reservations with Chope.
4
Everything was very good .... place, food & especially the service.
Only regret was the sitting arrangements were too cramped. Lack of enough privacy ....
I could hear all the conversations of my neighbour ...
2
Went there for a business lunch. the '38 sgd 2 course' set lunch goes like this: half the choices require you to pay extra (i.e. for dish xy +6 sgd), when you want to substitute potatoes with fries it is not possible. When you order a diet coke, your high-class small glass will be filled by half a can of diet coke. the other half is not for you as it is not classy to serve a can. but it is classy to ask for 7 sgd for that half can diet coke. when you add service charge and gst your '38 sgd 2 course' set lunch becomes sgd 59.50. was it tasty at all? the salad was good, the sirlon with potatoes was nt. average piece of meat, a bunch of tiny potatoes, all a bit tasteless. nah, that was nt good.avoid this joint for lunch unless you want to see how laughable this whole place is
4
We had the Shiraz at happy hour price, crab salad, wagyu ribeye for 2 and the chocolate truffle cake with coffee/chamomile tea. The caviar came with a few condiments and they were good. Best item was the crab salad. The wagyu was too fatty for our liking but the chocolate truffle cake was a good ending to our dinner. Many reviewers mentioned the tables being placed too close together and I found this to be true. Hence we struggled with our conversation without being too distracted by our neighbour's. Place seems understaffed but they were polite and helpful when you get their attention
3
Went there for lunch with my colleague. I order the 3-course lunch which was actually not too bad. However the service was a little bit shaky and some staff seems constatnly looking at their mobile and sending txts
4
A solid choice for an inner city eatery - certainly not cheap and we only went as we had a discount voucher, however overall I would recommend this for business lunches or a special dinner out.Menu was interesting, certainly with some different spins on the norm. I had the gaspacho soup which was well flavoured and what it should be, and the steak was very tender and tasty. My colleague had the froi gras which was good (but not exceptional) and the duck confit which adequate.Otherwise good atmosphere, solid drinks menu and good location
4
We have been here a few times - the place setting and decor is of course immediately nostalgic and attractive. But that is precisely what we come for - the food is above decent but not exceptional, nothing you can't find in similar-type restaurants here. And yes, the price is just a teeny weeny bit on the high side for a "self-serve-cutlery-tin-on-your-table" style of dining. The vibe is active (translation - noisy) and service is not that attentive. Good place to have a fun night out with friends and a large group, not so much for intimate dining
4
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at the Black Swan. The wine service was very good as was the food service. The menu offered a nice selection of dishes. All of the food we ordered was very good. The Duck Confit was exceptional as was the Seafood Pasta. We were disappointed to be charged for some extra bread for our Pate and Rillette appetizer. The appetizer was served with only four slices of bread which insufficent. Such a petty thing to do at such a classy place especially since we were not advised of the charge
5
The booking was conveniently arranged through Chope. We ordered the lamb chops, seafood linguine, pork collar and calamari to share. The lamb chops and pork collar were very nicely done; Calamari was lovely as well and the portion was quite generous. I would recommend to make a slightly later booking for dinner and have a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar. The Black Swan bar serves really good cocktails (and a pretty decent selection of whiskey). Overall a great place for couples on dates or dinner with an small group of friends.
3
Made res through Chope and arrived early. They accommodated us after a few minutes much to our pleasure. Tables are stacked pretty close which hurts the intimacy factor given everyone can the surrounding tables convos. Service was under par for this style and price point of restaurant. We were constantly trying to get any server's attention - rarely did anyone make the attempt to check in on us or get our order. They food was good
5
Excellent food. Can't miss the chocolate bomb pudding. Excellent decor and staff. Very much like a London restaurant in character and menu. This may or may not be what you are looking for in Singapore obviously. I loved it.
4
Must try: Oysters, Escargot and the Chocolate Dome dessert.
They have a happy hour where oysters and champagne have a discount.
The service was great, service crew were very attentive and nice.
*thumbs up*
4
Nice ambience, delicious food and excellent service. I would recommend BlackSwan to anyone. A great dinng experience

Five of us were at Powder Room (The Black Swan) on Wednesday night for the Singapore Cocktail Week. We ordered the drinks on their special cocktail menu and some snacks. It took 20 minutes before they served the drinks and the waitress spilled one over the table. It took them another 10 minutes to fix that drink... The hot plate came after, but we had to ask for plates and serviette twice. We were about to finish our drinks and realized the cheese platter was still not there. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was on the way. I questioned her whether she had just put the order in but she didn't tell the truth. We cancelled the order, paid and left. The cocktails were pretty average

location - tucked opposite of Capita Green, the entrance brings you to the movie set of The Great Gatsby. Easy to get there via public transport with MRT station just a sneeze awaypremise - lovely and 1960's cool. It sets you back in time and all it lacks are girls with feathers dancing on a platformcrowd - business people mainly with the odd couples and also friends. Nice place for after hours drinks with HH starting from 6pm - 8pm.service - very good and dedicated. reservations are recommended via CHOPE. it can get crowded.staff - polite and attentive, it makes you feel like a proper patron of a posh restofood - very good and very well priced. Not OTT expensive but generically priced as per many other posh-ish restos. For SQ travelers, Black Swan tied down with SQ for the boarding pass privileges program - you get 15% discount of the total bill before SGT and Service charge.verdict - we felt really good eating there with the good ambiance and service, it was close to a 5-star rating only setback was the location as it was IN the CBD and thus, CBD fees apply for car users from out of town
3
Went there for my bday - Lobsters were not available - pretty disappointing as its not a very elaborate menu. Noone told us at the start - cos we made up our mind and then were told they are not available.No bday mention : S disappointing
4
We visited this restaurant without any knowledge before, and was very surprised to find such a fantastic place close to our hotel ( Fullerton Bay).Really nice food, and fairly pricelevel.We had grilled lobsters, top class as the maincourse, and different entrÃ©s. All to very high standard
5
Friday night it was louder and busier than expected - we will note that for future visits - the after-work crowd, but the restaurant is gorgeous, with amazing architecture and style. What struck us most was the service - just completely aware and on the ball, great staff and not a single 'miss' at all with anyone we dealt with. The food and wine was excellent - nothing crazy in terms of the menu, fairly standard fare, but very well done. A great approach, with familiar menu items done in that just-that-bit-better style. The wine list is reasonably pricey, but spot-on selections, we are quite picky and were pleased with the wines available. We were definitely won over and will be back
4
Black Swan has a very cool chic Art Deco feel that reminded me of the beach front restaurants in Miami's South Beach - Part glamour, part Great Gatsby. Though the restaurant was right smack in the middle of the Central Business District, it remained intimate and cosy. Our party of 4 ordered the escargots, beef tartare, foie gras and crab salads to start and the highlight here really was the beef tartare - the patty was filled with perfectly minced beef with a zest of lemon and went really well with the toasted bread. The main worth raving about was the Mangalica Pork Collar- a very generous portion (6-7oz) which was done to perfection. The meat was succulent and juicy, one of the best pork collars i've had. In terms of service, most of the wait staff were attentive and always ensured our glasses were always topped up. The place looks great to have after work drinks too, definitely recommended
5
I have been living in Singapore and dine out often .The dinner in Black Swan has been one of the best experiences I have had ! Food was excellent and service was extraordinary ..very attentive waiters who know what should be done every step..Good ambiance and decor.We were a group of 6 and all of us share the same and think it was exquisite We will definitely be back frequently..Recommend highly
4
Great place for gathering with friends and colleagues at happy hours...
High quality food for a restaurant pub... And friendly staff...
4
The best truffle fries ever. The drinks are quite unique and the food choices were very good. We went back a second time for more fries.
5
Came here for an anniversary dinner and was pleasantly surprised by some bubbly on the house. Food was great - must try egg crostini! So much more we missed, will have to head back for their happy hour deals.
5
The food was great!
Love their selection of oysters and wine.
We had the pork special and their black swan burger. Both tasted excellent.
5
We were there for a business lunchEntering the restaurant, we were promptly greeted.Quickly we were led to our seats assigned and drinks offered.Glasses were regularly refilled throughoutLunch went smoothly without a hitch.Ordered from the set menu, felt that serving size for the mains was just right, leaving enough stomach space for the dessertshowever as place is lively, noise level is something to watch out for when the crowd starts coming in.Oveall, it was a pleasant outing. Will consider this place again for business lunch
4
Let me start by saying that I love a restaurant that has lots of character, and The Black Swan oozes that vintage, 1920's glamour, speakeasy feeling. The decoration is true to the era, with a gorgeous bar in the middle of the room where you can feel the grandeur of the place. Everything is branded with the Black Swan monogram, and it is evident that no detail has been overlooked. The food is great as well, but in particular the seafod linguini really stood out. There is a generous serving of prawns, calamari and clams, coated with a spicy garlic tomato sauce that explodes with flavour! It was absolutely delicious...I could have gone for seconds :) The vibe of the restaurant is very intimate, and is perfect for a date or a night out with a group of your (closest) friends. The service was very good as well - I appreciate when my wine glass is never left empty, and the waitress was always available without hovering over us. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for dinner or even for a cocktail and the atmosphere. In addition, make sure you check the schedule on Facebook for live music nights.

First the lights were all off when we still having lunch...aircon was off as well..and then their system was down that all bills have to be done manually...which of course took them ages to prepare.....and when I was told it's ready I said I can pay cash if they want, and they said credit card is fine....in the end, the credit card machine didnt work.......finally I have to pay cash and they had hard time to give me the change...... all along they just said once or twice "Sorry"....that's it...and they are happily still charging me 10% service fee......I will be stupid if I go back there again!!!!!! crap! 
5
This has to be one of my favourite bar/restaurants in Singapore, simply for the interior design and ambience alone. The service is also excellent, a rarity in Singapore.I love the food here too both in the bar and the restaurant it's excellent as is the wine selection by the bottle if not by the glass which could be improved.But the venue is the reason why you can come here and enjoy a relaxing night or lunch with business associates especially.highly recommended
5
Black Swan is classy but accessible. They greet you by name as you enter with a reservation, which is a nice touch. Their oyster selection is one of the best in SG (but they are super fresh so can tend to run out). My guests raved about the burger which is reasonably priced considering the quality, and perfectly cooked.
5
Hidden in the heart of the Financial District you may find The Black Swan. A restored deco-style building over two levels with great bars, mood lighting, best drinks and sublime service. This is class with no rowdiness. Suggest going upstairs where it's quite private. For those seeking a little sophistication and class, this bar is the one.
4
Attentive staff, great location and ambience. Meal was delicious but a little pricey. Great spot to go with friends for a drink and a nice meal. Excellent service. Would recommend this restaurant to others
5
Staff was very helpful to reallocate us seating to accommodate the big group. the restaurant also planned a pleasant surprise for a friend who is leaving the country. thumbs up.
5
We were for the first time in Black Swan and I would rate the place at a very high level. Premises are in art deco style, the bar is classy but the room a little bit noisy for a quiet dinner. The choice on the menu is limited but all the dishes we ordered were delicious in particular the wagyu ribeye. The chocolate dome for dessert was tasty but not too heavy. The choice of wine by the glass is decent (late harvest riesling was terrific with the dessert). Last but not least, the service is definitely above average for Singapore: friendly and professionnal. They also noticed we were celebrating and had a special attention for dessert. A very good surprise in the cbd
5
We actually went twice to this with clients for lunch as it was so good.The atmosphere and construction of the bar creates a great looking restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere combined with very attentive staff.For the main course I tried out the burger on my first trip and the steak on the second trip both of which were very well cooked and also really good quality meat
5
My wife and I went over in Singapore for a business trip then on the way back we search some places for dinner. we decided to dine at the black swan the glamorous interior makes you feel way back in1920's. The food takes quite sometime but the duck confit was perfectly done. The place is not ideal for intimate dinner coz of the noise coming out from the other side of the restaurant so if you looking forward to go here don't bring along your kids with you. but what caught our attention is the "SERVICE" when the time that we are settling the bill i just realise that i need to pay for valet service but we run out of SGD so we try and ask the waitress if its possible to charge my card extra and pass me 20dollars in return the waitress approach us that is not possible then we ask if they can change our malaysian currency in to SGD but still cannot then on the way out there is one guy namely "sherwin" bid farewell and passing us 6dollars from his own wallet. we are shock to see that a waiter will do this thing so in return we insist giving him 20 malaysian money but he refuse i was amazed by his hospitality even thou at the end of the meal we expect the unexpected great job sherwin! you are one of a kind definitely we will gonna come back and bring along our friends and family at the blackswan to look for you...see you soon..

I've been to the Black Swan close to half a dozen times for lunch and dinner over the past year. The place tends to quite buzzing particularly at night at drinks. It's a good place for drinks and a light meal. I particularly like the Caesar salad. Generally service which often is hard to find these days in Singapore
4
My partner and I chanced upon this place while searching for good dinner / supper places that could accommodate us at 10.30pm on a Friday night. We hadn't had dinner yet as we had ended work late and we thought The Black Swan, which was nearby, might be a good choice since it was a bar / restaurant. Although they take last orders for main courses at 10.15pm, the staff were incredibly accommodating when they heard of our situation and were willing to take our orders even though it was past 10.15pm. That, to me, was going the extra mile and being understanding towards a guest's needs, which speaks of a very high standard of service and made our dining experience a memorable one.The service really stood out for me. The staff are well-trained, educated about their product and able to give good recommendations of cocktails according to the guest's preferences. We were looking for a refreshing drink and were happy with what the waiter recommended - our Stinger Julep, a summery concoction of honey and mint-infused vodka shaken with grapefruit juice and grenadine, and the Earl Grey Passionfruit mocktail (the passionfruit, mint and almond syrup certainly gave the traditional Earl Grey a tropical and revitalising twist).The food was good too. We had the Black Swan Burger, which was juicy, succulent and would make us come back for more (we especially loved the egg atop a brilliantly grilled medium beef patty) and the Duck Leg Confit, which was also tender, plump and not too salty.The Art Deco building, ample and open spaces, and Gatsby-inspired ambience also makes this place a great venue for dates, group gatherings (company parties, perhaps?) and dinners with friends. Will definitely return as this is one of my favourite places now
5
My wife and I went to Black Swan, just to try something different, but yet upscale in Singapore. The art deco interior is amazing. The bar and bartenders play the part to be sure. We were pleasantly surprised the food was really great. Waygu rib eye for two is one of the best in Singapore, and I love steak! We tried a few wines and when one was a little off the quickly gave me a new one. Great for date night, or a group of good friends
4
The service was exceptional. Our table was assigned to April. She was very very smiley and happy. Attentive but not overly so. The decor was good and this is expected. I can't comment too much on the food as we only went for some champagne and oysters and some tempura calamari. The kafir lime aioli was bloody good though! Calamari batter light and fluffy, so no complaints Would I revisit to have a dinner, probably s
5
My partner and I recently visited the Black Swan in Singapore for my Birthday! I cannot tell you how amazing this place is! Firstly, the restaurant itself is stunning! Secondly, the food was delicious and drinks were fantastic. Finally, the service was absolutely top notch! Staff were helpful, knowledgeable, attentive and very very friendly! We were very satisfied and will definitely return on all our future trips to Singapore!Highly recommended
4
Great place to hang out with the girls after work since it's right in Raffles Place. I love the cocktail with the lemon sorbet.
4
This was the first time that I turned up. It was pretty good. The good came quickly and was of good quality. Service was attentive. Recommended.
5
Large group of 29 & again great food & outstanding service.
Noisy restaurant but perfect for our group as we added to it.
thanks guys - you have outdone yourself again.
Keeps getting better. cheers & see you soon.

My first time here.. went on a Wednesday evening at 7pm for a double date wit friends, place was already half full and hopping! First thing I noticed immediately was the beautiful decor and theme the Black Swan has, followed by the attentive and helpful wait staff. Not to mention, happy hours drinks and half-dozen oysters are very worthwhile. We had a the fried calamari which was tasty but could use a little less batter, also ordered the beef tartare which did not disappoint. For mains, we tried the Black Swan Burger, seafood linguine and duck confit - all of which were pretty good value. I only wish the burger beef patty could have been slightly tastier.We ended the night with cocktails - Good Night Peru, Stinger Julep and Escape to Amalf. For those who like it a little lighter and sweet, I'd recommend the Stinger Julep. Not a bad experience overall, however I think if it were a little quieter, it would have been a perfect visit. :
5
Last visited on 12th May 2014. Highly recommended- seafood linguini, foie gras, mini burger, Stockyard Australia Wagyu Ribeye Steak (for two persons) comes with fries. The fries were good! For oysters, do not order the promotion of 2 oysters plus 1 glass of champagne. Lower quality of oysters were given. Like the atmosphere here. Excellent service by most of the staff managed by Edwin Seow. Edwin delivers deadpan humour that put you at ease and make you like him instantly

Located in Singapore's business district, this place offer's one of the best value for money business lunch. Food is great, do try the Balck Swan burger, it is delicious. Service is prompt, attentive and excellent. A la carte proposition is clear and easy to choose from.The kind of Art DÃ©co atmosphere adds a special touch which make the place cosy with a little bit a "grand" feeeling.Worth trying and going back to
4
Had a great time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was great for date night. The cocktails were yummy. I had the Duck Leg Confit and he had the Seafood linguini, both delicious. I only marked this place down because the waitress accidentally tipped a glass of red wine over and splashed on my date. She was horrified though, poor thing. Highly recommend it.
2
Dinning room was pleasant - a cross between an old high ceiling-ed deco banking hall, unusually furnished with french bistro tables and a modern uptake on cane-backed chairs.Service was painful...........Excuse me - do you think we could have a look at a menu?Excuse me - do you think we could order some drinks?Excuse me - do you think we could order food?Waitress was about to pour Laurent Perrier Rose into a wine glass - managed to get the bottle back upright, and glasses changed.Once the food arrived, it was perfectly acceptable.Nice duo of duck rillettes and foiegras parfaitSeafood linguini - okLobster - small with a strange flavourBurger - very goodOverall, a return visit is unlikely
3
Beautifully decorated and brimming with moneyed types it's a place for showing off if you need to. Loads of expats and mostly men, women who like these crowds would find this paradise. Waitresses are keen to sell you bottles and they flirt the best they can. Food is pretty good, drinks are average, vibe is so so. If the expat crowds rotate fast enough they will do fine. There are many better places in SG
2
Went with a group for dinner and had a SGD 120++ menu. The main course had 3 options, one of which was lobster, which wasn't available halfway through ordering. They should have said so when we arrived and provide an alternative, none was done. It felt very awkward that business clients ordering later had no option for this. If the staff would have anticipated better, I wouldn't have to apologize to the guests.Food was ok, but foie gras had to much salt
4
Food was good, our group had a mixture of light and heavy meals and all were good. Service was quick for lunch. Typical noisy lunch place makesit dificult fr serius business discusson though.
5
Another masterpiece from the Lo & Behold Group.
Great food, cool bar with an overall Great Service.
Staff are helpful & always available. They also check In to see how we were doing.
Will be heading back.
5
Saw the photos of the restaurants in many magazines and it has always been a restaurant we wanted to visit/ Glad we did and we wondered what took us so long !! Firstly, the dcor was truly captivating like a luxurious 1920s movie set, opulent, lavish and very stylish. Glad we dressed up for the evening. The menu was comprehensive with a varied selection. The friendly manager came by to explain the menu and wine list to us and made some recommendations. We started with the very fresh oysters followed by beef tartare, crispy calamari. Really enjoyed our starters. For our mains, we shared the steak which was cooked to perfection.In summary, it has been a beautiful dining experience of good food, nice wine, beautiful restaurant and attentive staff. Will certainly be back again

We ate at the Black Swan on Saturday night for dinner. The restaurant itself is beautifully presented and has a real vibe to it. Very attentive staff although not overly attentive so as they became annoying. Excellent food, the Truffled Veloute eggs were amazing as was the bone marrow. Myself and a friend had the sharing steak which was cooked to perfection my wife had the Linguini which she said was one of the best she had tasted. My only criticism over the steak main course was the small side of fries and miniscule pot of Bernaise sauce are definitely only enough for 1 person and if the steak is for 2 people then each person should get there own fries and sauce. Thankfully, I don't like Bernaise but you get the point. Perhaps as a suggestion maybe offer some alternative sauces??? Pepper, Truffle etc..... All in all however a really enjoyable dinner and definitely somewhere that I will return to

Retrofitting old banks as hip new eateries is something that been going on in places like NY, Paris, London and SF for ages; however, up until The Black Swan it was not something commonly found on the Singapore scene. Nevertheless, it's nice to see that the beautiful decor doesn't overshadow the excellent food and service. Rather, the service and food compliment the beautiful location. I hope they can keep it up well after the hype has died down. Helpful hint: as a function of the somewhat loud space, this place is perfect for casual drinks, groups for social occasions or noisy groups for dinner - rather than intimate dates

We visited a few weeks back for some drinks and to have a look at this recently opened venue. Impressed we booked for dinner on a Saturday night. The menu is well structured, great choices and fantastic cooking. Even though the restaurant was only one third full there was still a great atmosphere. The staff are very pleasant and attentive when you seek their assistance, that said the team appear disorganized and we were left waiting 15 mins before asking for our order to be taken and they forgot our desert order, which to be fair when eventually came was good and taken off the bill. Overall the ingredients in place for a fantastic restaurant once there is an obvious floor manager in place to organize the team.

I had a dinner date at the Black Swan with my husband. Have heard a lot about the restaurant in the last few months. Seems like it is the latest "hip" location for a drink. Location is great because it's right behind my office building. First impressions, I was not impressed with the service. When I arrived for my reservation, I was seated at a very small table and no one offered to help me find a place for my 2 massive bags. I was also not given a menu or offered a drink. So essentially I was sitting in the restaurant holding 2 massive bags with no menu and nothing to drink. When the drinks and food finally arrived things started to improve. I had a cocktail called Cecil Sour which was amazing with a nice added touch of a salted dark chocolate to nibble on. The pair of oysters that came with champagne during happy hour was another great drink option. Foodwise, I was very impressed with their bone marrow and crostini. It had a delicious salty taste and melt-in-your-mouth texture. The mains were less impressive - we ordered the duck confit and tenderloin and I thought both were ok but not exceptional and portions were quite small. In the end I liked the bone marrow so much and wanted to continue drinking we ordered another portion for dessert! So I think next time will come only for afterwork drinks and snacks and have dinner elsewhere

A must-visit destination for anyone who is looking for the perfect combination of great food with tiptop service. They provide the best service I've received in an F&B joint in years! I was at the second level called the Powder Room and it's like a hidden treasure for a glamourous place like such to be up there! Their signature Beef Tartare is a must-try along with their Mushroom Crostini. Look for their knowledgeable bartender Andrew on the mezzanine level for the best service and recommendations on their impressive range of wines and whiskies. Bring your business client here (like I did) and let their dynamic team do the rest

We went on a Thursday evening and by 7.30 the place was buzzing! The food is excellent - hubby and I shared both starters and main course. The duck pate and rillard was simply delicious and just the right size. Our friends had the calamari, a ceaser salad and the truffled bacon eggs - all were superb! Then we had the wagyu rib eye and frites for 2 - again superb!! The wine list was great too. The service was very prompt and friendly and all in all a great night out with friends! Will definitely return

Hadn't given much thought about this place before since it was quite out of the way for me ever since detached myself from the CBD area. Had a dinner date there and it was a very pleasant experience.Decor wise it was chic and pretty classy, mellow lighting and with occasional 'flashes' through the muted frosted glass because of the cars driving by, especially if you're seated at the sides. Having said that, one does not get any exterior view thereby giving you the opportunity to appreciate your conversations and the vast, high ceiling.Service was commendable and staff were quite attentive to diners' needs. Our waitstaff was on hand to recommend the best oysters that day and helped us select based on our preference for starters. Following that, we had the Jamon Iberico de Bellota served with bread.We had the duck confit and the tenderloin for our mains. One thing that needs to be highlighted was the duck confit which was very well prepared. Many restaurants do not get this right - either they're too dry or too salty or overcooked. We were pleasantly surprised to find this tender and moist, much to our delight.Recommended place for a meal here in the CBD, for a dinner-date, or drinks with friends
