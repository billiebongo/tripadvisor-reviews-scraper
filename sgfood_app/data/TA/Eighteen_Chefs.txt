I've heard of Eighteen Chefs for quite some time and finally have the chance to go there.It has a DIY ordering, food served concept with the ambient of a western restaurant but without service charges. You can take your own sweet time to decide what to order and write them on the order sheet provided.There is customised made spaghetti menu which is quite interesting.The quality of food is actually above my expectations and without service charges, making it slightly cheaper than the standard casual dining. Certainly likes this place and will come back again

This place is a good place to have your meal to treat your inner atas feels but have not much of a budget. Their portions are generally quite small but there is an option for upsize. Popular with teenagers gathering here, you often hear lots of them exclaiming here and there thus making the environment a little chaotic. The service staffs will help you when in need but when they are shortage of them, it is quite obvious.

We got seated immediately and the food came out maybe 5-10 minutes after we placed our order. (not sure if that is good or bad... good being quick and bad being do they use fresh ingredients at all?) Out of all we ate, I only liked the beef. It was just right and tender enoughThe pasta was not as good as the one I ate at a coffee shop (for half the price) and the soup was just weird to me. It was a mixture of corn and chowder. (I think)The chicken was crispy on the outside and dry on the inside. Their ice lemon tea had an artificial taste according to my mom and sister, but I felt it was ok

This is our first at this eating hole and the variety of offering is pleasantly good. The burgers are worth the try so are the platters including the chicken dishes that comes with a bowl of rice. I'm guessing it's a combination of dark sweet soy sauce for the rice. The rice is not to our taste bud... But the wings are just as good.

Tried it out as it was a newly opened halal restaurant. Tried the make yourself kind of dish. The ingredients range from pasta to rice, with more than 7 different kind of sauce, along with another ingredient such as sliced fish, sausage, beef and many more. Love eating this because of the cheese. Always orders the double cheese baked pasta with white sauce. Tried the signature fried rice. Utterly dissapointing. It tastes like rice with soya sauce,and that's all. The steak that came with it was also so-so. Rather eat the baked pasta.Tried one of the burger and my dad loves the chilli that came along with it. It is his regular dish everytime we go there. Dessert is acceptable. Tried the waffle and ice cream. Taste like any other waffles outside. Nothing much to it. Food doesn't take long to be prepared. Price is acceptable. Students and ntuc members can get a discount when dining there (plus point!

We went to Jcube branch. Food is nothing to write about. My children like it as they have good student & NS discounts. For me, it was overpriced for the quality. But they run it for a noble cause. Plus I was impressed to see a sign which said that they welcome guide dogs. A restaurant with a heart so I will return. Though I wish they pay more attention to the food & make prices reasonable

I grabbed a quick lunch here - heart attack fried rice with steak and a strawberry mango smoothie. The smoothie was delicious. The fried rice was sticky and very so-so. The steak was nicely cooked, but it didn't really taste that good, until I realized that I wasn't using the dipping sauce they have. The dipping sauce is spicy and packed with flavor. The place isn't very expensive and convenient to my office, but I'm lukewarm on it in general. Try it once and see what you think - it's not a destination location in my opinion.(Note: Grange road location
