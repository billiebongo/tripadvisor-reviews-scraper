Had today today with two more adults and my granddaughters, one of which stated best burger she had ever eaten. Great location, lovely view and friendly staff. Would recommend. Coffee very good. Love the homemade bagels.

Best Bagels in Town! Food is of high standard, you can tell the international experience of the Chef and Team there. Nice to have this in Sentosa. Breakfast is very good and go early so you have a seat, the drinks are also well done.

Definitely the best breakfast on Sentosa Cove - tasty, healthy if that’s what you are looking for and good coffee.
I will be back to try dinner one day soon!!

I celebrated my son’s first year at Schmear and had been in talks with the owner from a month back to get it going. Discussions were forthcoming up until the point I made my deposit. On the day of the party the restaurant had high traffic (unexpected, says the owner), and we were assigned one person to our party of 50. My husband had to move the furniture around because there was no one on hand to help (and none of the wait staff were willing to other than the one restaurant manager); the food were not laid out where they were meant to according to the floor plan I had requested the owner prior to the event — in fact they were placed on tables our guests were meant to be seated at, resulting in a severe lack of seating for families with young children initially — and food all came out late. Our guests were lingering around without a bite and we had to keep hurrying the kitchen. Really unprofessional given they knew the size of the party and our food orders. My husband then asked one of the wait staff if they had takeaway boxes we could use. She just said “no”. We later asked the restaurant manager again and he kindly gave us a few. Redeeming factors:- Great service by the restaurant manager. The poor guy was the only person assigned to our party while the other wait staff attended to the straggling crowd at the other half of the restaurant - Great atmosphere (though this is more location than any credit of the management team)It was a very disappointing experience given we had high expectations for our son’s first year celebration. We won’t be back.

A sleepy little bagel place, which has a very strong feel of a good neighborly joint. Problem is of course, if you're not from the neighborhood, it may not feel as good. Location in Sentosa means you have to pay to come on the island, and then pay again to park at Quayside Isle. However, bagels are good, and fresh. Service is a little disjointed but forgivable on New Years Day

Cool location with views of the marina and the boats/yachts. Brunch comprised of bagels (the southwestern) and a 3-egg omelette. Food was decent and service prompt. Bagel could have been fresher. The sautéed potatoes that came with the omelette was not complete done - still a little hard. Coffee: long black, mocha and latte were above average. Nothing to write home about.

Visited Sat morning. Restaurant not busy. Staff are rude, totally disinterested and reluctant to serve. Extended wait to get any food or drinks.....30 mins for one bagel. It’s a shame as when the bagel did arrive it was very nice. Staff attitude just taints the whole experience

Around 10-15 people work here and yet service is so bad. What a spoiler for Sunday morning breakfast. Waited 30mins when first bagel arrived. Then 15mins later we asked about the omelette. 5mins later the waiter picked up the omelette which was left with another customer for 10mins already and tried to serve us the same after the customer already touched it. The manager or owner like lady who served the omelette to the wrong person did not even apologise. How disgusting. Sadly schmear is not worth the effort. I'd rather stick to Miska where you get freshly made wholesome food. As about to leave now the manager owner lady apologies but does not repair anything. Overall I think mgmt need to get more customer friendly rather than rely only on their food. My experience was bad enough not to return here.

This restaurant is popular so we gave it a go. It was just after 9am and the restaurant was about a third full. We ordered two take away coffees and two take away New Yorker bagels. It was a 30 minute wait for the coffee and still no sign of the bagels. No concern about the delays and no communication from the staff as to what was happening. The bagels were ordinary, wouldn't bother going back based on our experience. There are better bagels in Singapore

Very original New York style bagels. I have not been able to get any good bagels in Singapore. Glad I found this place. Good pizza selection, steak sandwich and burgers. Great selection of bagels with filling. Menu looks good for breakfast, brunch and nice dinner menu too.
