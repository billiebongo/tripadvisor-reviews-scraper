Had dinner and tried the pork loin with truffle mash. The pork was tasted just right, not too dry and the truffle potatoes is so smooth and addictive, cannot stop myself from finishing the mash... Surely will return to eat the wonderful pork loin again.

Just visited this place last week. The prices are still reasonable as the potion is perfect for a person to get full. Foods were delicious and the appearances were good. Will visit here again.

i was craving for western food in the West side .. typically American hamburger ( those big large type) with guilty French fries...From online surveys, I found this local nighborhood eatry which is 20mins bus ride from my home..So with my family we ordered 1. fish and chips, 2. cheese burger, 3. grilled chicken plate and 4. seafood pasta..it was 6pm where the place is not crowded on a Wednesday evening, order was taken from our table which is good ( from past comments cashier seems to demerits a lot of points here)..Pasta came in less then 5mins with my mushroom soup..( $6 for a normal cup size soup is a little expensive). Next came the burger and then chicken. Guess they need more time to do the fish and chips..best of them all- fish and chip.. my son finished them all.ambient was good considered the location is in a shoplot, one should not complaint. but I notice the fries were done different from past posts and now. Maybe cost pressure..Overall is good! cash terms only.

Visited this restaurant at the Yuhua Village at Jurong East. Not bad with open concept kitchen and occupies the whole coffee shop which open for dinner only at 5:30pm. Food wise has good selection and most of it are unique and not commonly found in the market western food stall which is great. I've ordered a striploin steak & stick ribs with orzo. Rib was good but the orzo salad was a bit bland for me. The steak was nicely done, soft on the inside while lack seasoning. Overall, I would come back to try their order dishes

Tuna Salad Nicoise ($14 nett)I'd been eating all freaking day, so it was time to go for this salad that I'd always been curious about, but never tried because I was always starving when I come here & ain't nobody got time fo salads when hangry. Turns out this is more filling than I expected it to be! Not as much as a pasta dish, obviously.. But quite substantial. Could be the many salad leaves, could be the potato chunks. I wish they put the dressing to the side, though. If I order this again, I will be sure to ask of this.Sticky Pork Ribs ($16 nett)Tender, almost fall-off-the-bone ribs. Good flavours, I'd order this again. I've never paired pork ribs with Orzo Salad, but it was tangy & went quite well together.Norwegian Salmon Steak ($16.50 nett)One of my usual favourite dishes except different this time - I think when they revamped their menu, they replaced couscous with Orzo Salad? & also it is now more expensive? Still a great steak though, but old-timers beware the lack of couscous Roast Chicken ($10 nett)Just a picture - didn't actually eat this, so I reserve my comments. But it looked good & quite tender.Washed down everything with a cold pint of Brewerkz Pilsner that was super refreshing. They do have draft beer as well (my Asahi Black ), with a promotion of 3 pints of beer for $30 nett for that.  Cash only NO NETS OR CREDIT CARDSâ˜€ Alfresco seats only 3 pints of beer for $30 nett Long queues at peak hou

As mentioned by other reviewers, the cashier takes her time taking orders. Perhaps purposely to create a queue.After ordering, the food arrives quickly. So the wait is really placing the order and paying.Food (sides such as calamari rings, fried chicken wing, pasta etc.) is mostly reasonably price. The steak is not cheap though, ribeye at $25, especially since this is in a coffee shop with no airconditioning. The ribeye was tasty, but slightly tough. It came with sides such as salad, wedges. Pasta was average.Probably wouldn't come again, since $25 steak could be had at restaurants rather than a coffee shop

Considering this is 'hawker food' it's definitely considered pricey. For meat/fish dishes it's $10 and above and as for pasta it's dependent on what you order. Beer on tap is $10. Sometimes drinking at a pub is much cheaper. I've been patronising this stall since their opening and realised two things:1. They've cut cost by compromising on quality. E.g. Their grilled salmon used to come with this vegetable salsa that's laden with a myriad of vegetables but now it's just filled more with tiny pasta.2. Prices are increasing. White snapper used to be just $10, now it's $15. For items like chicken wings, it's used to be a whole wing, now they halved a wing and consider that as 2 pieces, when it's actually just 1.That being said, I will still eat here when I crave for western but definitely not often as it's not that wallet friendly, hawker style.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this western restaurant at the ground floor of a HDB flat, right smack beside a hawker centre. It was a Thursday evening but there were still 12 folks in front of us and we waited standing 30-40mins before ordering.Surprisingly, beer and food was served within 5-10 minutes if ordering and we could hardly believe it. Enjoyed my roast chicken as I was famished by then. Western fare with local prices (unless you order the steaks which cost more than $20).Worth a try if you are in Jurong East area

If 'the carving board' does not change their cashier (expressionless bespectacled young lady), this place will face the consequences of closing down. The cashier taking the order is holding up the queue. She is taking her own sweet time in taking the orders, oblivious of the very long queue (which extends to the car park). Food is good here. However, the long queue will deter the customers from patronizing. This will be my last time patronizing unless the management changes the cashier

Really, please don't eat at this place. Extremely rude cashier, yelling at customer, her air is like as if hee customers are idiots, and their support is given.The food is so ordinary. There are much better choice in Singapore. Please don't bother about this place
