Had an enjoyable 3 courses for lunch and will definitely revisit again. The pre starter was really yummy. The crab was alright, venison and dessert was on point.

Great food and great service, it gets no better.
Creative and passionate with lots of energy, throw in fresh ingredients and you have Cure.

A lovely birthday treat for my Husband . Set menu and we choose the 5 item menu. Lovely presentation, I’m all about the textures.Different chefs came out to explain to us the different dishes . Servers and staff were very friendly and attentive , which is possible with a small place like theirs. Price wise - 2 pax plus 2 glass of wine came up to $400 plus . It certainly is a bit pricey , I could possibly have eaten a bit more , and had I not have had any bread in the beginning , it’s possible I might have been a bit Hungrier if I had left that part out. They change their menu every 3 months and it’s definitely a restaurant for the occasions rather than weekly at that price range .

Had the most fabulous lunch here on our recent holiday with our 2 teenage daughters. The lunch menu is great value 2 courses at $49 or 3 courses for $55. All the food was beautifully presented and delicious. The bread was so divine and I also loved the 2 included canapés at the start. The fish course I had was so delicate and so tasty. The restaurant is ultra cool and chic but as lunch was quite with only one other table it did lack some atmosphere. The manager was friendly and helpful and was quick to recommend some great hawker centres and other gastronomic delights around Singapore. I would definitely dine here again

We've had dinner at many Michelin star rated restaurants and Cure is that same quality. The food is fantastic - unique, high quality and delicious. Presentation is beautiful.The wine pairing was also great.Service was attentive and friendly - we were a group of 7 friends having a reunion dinner and the staff helped to make it a very special evening. Highly recommended

From the reviews we thought this place would be great but it just didn’t reach that level for us. It’s an eclectic decor, quite nice and modern. The servers are mostly younger and seemingly inexperienced. We did the larger tasting menu and while the presentation of all dishes is very good, we just never got that wow factor from the food. A couple of dishes were quite average (the fish especially). The best was probably the amuse bouche. They try and mix different ingredients and different textures but again, while nothing was bad, nothing was great either. The menu ends with two sweet dishes. Then they bring out a couple of petit four plus a couple of truffle chocolates with the coffee. It’s too much sweet note to finish. But this could be our taste. One dessert plus either the chocolate or the petit four is better balanced. And then there is the price. At the prices charged they are competing with some outstandingly good food elsewhere in Sg. Two of us, two glasses of wine, coffee, around $420. It’s just way too expensive for what you’re getting. We are cured.

Had the tasting menu and price is reasonable. All the dishes are well executed; love the pumpkin soup, mains, and desserts. Andrew Walsh is a very talented; I expect him to get more awards soon!Ambiance is a little casual, happy with that.Staffs are very professional and tactful; came over to apologize when a few diners talked pretty loudly at the bar counter. Tip: sit away from the bar counter
5
Of course the food is the most important thing at any restaurant, and the food at Cure is excellent - fresh, interesting, creatively presented, and delicious. But beyond food, Cure gets all the other details right too, particularly the music - an eclectic, well-chosen playlist, played at a reasonable volume allowing for conversation without shouting, something so many otherwise great restaurants completely fail at. I loved the open kitchen, the art on the walls...the staff was friendly and efficient. I'm a little surprised they don't have a Michelin star, it's that good. Very expensive, especially with the wine pairing, but well worth a special night out
5
To be honest, I was pretty nervous before going to Cure. Fine dining gives off the impression that it would be a more proper, uptight sort of place, and I'm just not that kind of person. I chose Cure cos of reviews I've read online, and being intrigued by the food choices available, as well as the desire to bring a dear friend of mine to a place with good food and good service.Cure left such an indelible impression on me after yesterday's dinner. The waiters were friendly and took note whenever I needed help and remained respectful even when I asked multiple questions (not knowing how to read the menu). They gave us our space, yet quietly and quickly cleared our plates and our tables, or topped up our water. The timing of the dishes was respectful, going with our eating speed. I am blown away by the immaculate service that was given.Food was delightful throughout the dinner. I adored the flavours that were put together and the innovative touch to each dish in its display. The before dinner snacks were a joy to have, and the meat courses, though simple in its execution, really brought out the flavours and softness of each meat (my friend had beef while I had snapper). I loved the thoughtful surprise for my friend near the end of the meal as a celebration of her birthday.We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Beautiful cozy restaurant for deep conversations and a meaningful night spent! Would definitely come again
5
Creative and exciting food, professional (without being pretentious) service, affordable menus and an ambience that somehow manages to be casual, edgy and sophisticated... Cure gets everything right. Textures in the food play as big a role as flavours, and the artistry in the kitchen here will impress anyone who loves fine dining
5
Amazing food and fantastic service! We did the 5 course menu - highly recommended. Best restaurant in Singapore so far
5
Cure has a very non pretentious approach to fine dining. Casual atmosphere with open kitchen, very attentive and friendly staff. Now onto the meal, which is more like a culinary journey! Very interesting and unique combinations of flavours which all come together nicely in the chefâ€™s tasting menu. We enjoyed every single dish, there was nothing to fault. Highly recommended for the foodies.
5
Another really good Singapore restaurant without Michelin stars but confidently serving up sophisticated and very tasty food. I guess I've eaten at Cure at least 4 or 5 times and it's consistently a great experience - with an intimate "date-worthy" dining room, really well executed food, a great wine list (not ridiculously long like some) and friendly staff.
5
A great dimly lit place and ambience to experience courses of beautifully plated dishes. They have a great team. Perfect place for friends, business and even date nights. Prices are middle range which is still affordable and will cost more if paired with drinks but isn't that the way to a perfect night?
5
This is the second time we were having diner at Cure. We had been already very much impressed with our first visit. Last night diner was exceptional once again. Very original, so much tasty, amazing mixt of flavors . Service is very friendly and helpfull. Everything was perfect. Clearly, forus, one of the best restaurant in Singapore.
5
As always the food was exceptional and honest. Always great to see the Chef out finishing the food and chatting with the customers. I really recommend the wine pairing which is very well created. This is the 5th trip for me and each time the menu has changed. Great for a real culinary experience and look forward to my next dinner there
5
We found this place by a coincidence looking for somewhere to eat in Chinatown. They had a tasting menu but we chose from the a la carte.The food was amazing, so so good. Beautiful service and professional waiters. Don't miss out if you're in Singapore!
4
A great place in enjoying a mix of flavors. The restaurant is cozy and is dominated by the kitchen, attracting the attention of the guests watching the chef and his staff in cooking and settling the dishes to be served. The menu is exciting with different options and special ingredients, combining fish and meat with herbs and different type of spices. Good wine list.

Went to Cure for a birthday celebration. Read interesting reviews and decided to give it a try. The warm break basket with bacon bits on butter and picked cabbage started the meal with promising expectation. Also the bacon on the butter didn't quite rock my boat. Had several other snacks which were nice but I would call them excellent. We had one each of the duck and the cod for main course. Chef like to play with the textures of the food and that can turn out quite fun. We found the food predictable after a while. We ordered the 5 course dinner. Beetroot jam in a donut was a very Creative and unique palate cleanser. Dessert of the Guinness sandwich was memorable for us :)We also had a carafe of red wine which I though the price point and quality was great.
5
Had a set menu business lunch there going for the 3-courses with some friends on a weekday. They gave good bread, also 2 free amuse bouches (really good ones btw) and all courses were just excellent. This has to be one of the better set menu lunches I've had in some time, so there's no doubt I'll be going back. The front door is left open, which gives a fantastic breeze and not so crazy cold like you have in many places nowadays in Singapore. I can recommend it and they will see me again there!
2
Venue itself looked good enough but after we entered the place issues arose. We had to way a long time to be seated and our drinks took ages to arrive. Food was served in a hurry tough... Total lack of coordination between waiters and kitchen.
5
Lovely dinner at Cure. The food was inventive and delicious, with many little treats in between. The service was very attentive and friendly. Will come back again!
2
nothing new under the vast offer available in singapore: small portions, big prices. Deep fried items shouldnt recycle the oil from other preparations
5
Had to luck of eating here two days ago, found this little gem by accident...which was fortunate for me. I had the tasting menu with wine pairing which was perfect. Standout dish was the foie gras brulee with sweetcorn. Highly recommended this place to anyone...relaxed fine dining at its bes
5
My husband and I had dinner here during our stay in Singapore. The set menu was outstanding value for the quality. Each dish was thoughtful and artfully presented, down to the "snacks" and cocktail palate cleansers in between courses. Modern and cosy setting - perfect for a romantic dinner or meal with friends
5
Absolutely loved this restaurant. My husband booked it as a surprise. It did not disappoint! Superb food and wine. We did the wine pairing. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The service was excellent and non-intrusive. We read about this restaurant in an article from a newspaper in Ireland (Irish chef) we were so glad it lived up to its expectations. The chef came around the tables and talked to everyone too which was a nice touch. The open kitchen is great too!It's not cheap but the quality and sheer effort on presentation that goes into each plate will leave you excited to return again!

This restaurant offers a choice of taster menus, which are fairly reasonably priced by Singapore standards.The decor is minimal, dark walls, spot lighting but nice to see the open kitchen and the chefs at work.Service was pleasant, prompt and informative. Servers introduced the food well but never once asked after how it was.So, food wise from all the little courses and bits etc there three memorable dishes, the sour dough bread with some kind of butter and cabbage thing, delicious almond gazpacho with prawns and a dessert of some kind of icecream with a chocolate mousse that had been mixed through with dry ice. The chefs came out with the dessert, which was a nice touch.The other food we were given was totally unmemorable. Some dodgy textures. My Husband chose the beef rib-Super fatty and had been souvide cooked for many hours consequently its was almost gelatinous. Not the best way to treat meat.The whole dining experience was ok but with the amount of competition Cure has in Singapore, I don't think we'll be going back
5
I have been here several times. The service, food, wine and atmosphere is always very good - and consistently so. If you do chose to go for finer dining, but don't like to pay an arm and a leg , I have still to find a better alternative in Singapore
5
We enjoyed a delicious 7 courses (though, we really should have done the 5 courses), with a bottle of red wine. Food was creative, delicious and served by lovely staff. The Chef kindly replaced my liver course with something vegetarian. The mantra dee needs to stop swearing when telling stories - read the room
5
Great quality of food. Good saviors. The service is also excellent. The food design is fantastic, it's a culinary experience. The place is very well designed. Dark, ambiance, nice lighting. Perfect for a romantic dinner. 10/10 for the acoustic panels. One of the rare place in singapore to have dinner where the acoustic is good. 
5
The food was outstanding and the staff were very pleasant with excellent service. The head chef even came over and talked to us for several minutes.
5
This latest visit to Cure confirmed my mind was made up and this really is the best finding experience in singapore. Wonderful food, vibes, service and always leave smiling.
5
Amazing Fine Dining with a relaxing and modern twist. The food is clever, wonderfully presented and the tastes just explode in your mouth. Together with exceptional wine pairings and presented by a very professional, friendly and enthusiastic team, this was an amazing meal.
5
Food was great and service was attentive in an ambience conducive to a business or social dinner. What more could you ask for?
4
Friendly, focussed on quality ingredients, tasty dishes, delicious wines and a good atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit and potentially good for an occasion
4
Came back got the 3 course dinner. For started would recommend the beef tartare, main the beef short rib. Both desserts we tried were good - milk, lavender and honey was great, as well as the beetroot dessert.
5
I rarely write reviews, only when there is something worth sharing!Cure serves simply outstanding food. Really enjoyed the April weekend dinner menu with a range of European and Asian influences. It adds to the pleasure to have talented chefs make the decisions about what we were going to eat, in what quantity and in what order! The wine list is surprisingly affordable. The team are friendly and informal. Well done all round
5
Small and cozy restaurant serving both a la carte and chef tasting menu. Chef Andrew Walsh is not just a chef, he is an amazing artist. Chef's creations are always surprising, tasty and balanced, with an astonishing presentation. The service is impeccable and at the same time casual and welcoming. For now my favorite restaurant in Singapore.
5
LOCATION Understated minimalist yet cozy and refined. Finally a restaurant in Singapore where you are not bothered by unbearable noise level. The booth by the kitchen offers a great insight of what magic is created in the kitchenSERVICEFor sure my best experience so far in Singapore. Service is like the location: understated minimalist yet immensely efficient and capable. Finally a restaurant that is not overcrowded with aimless staff running around. I felt good and appreciated. FOODWelcoming canapés were good. We particularly enjoyed the truffle burrata and the sweet green peas tart. Appetizers were all great and presentation fantastic. We enjoyed the steak tartare and the fois gras brûlée. Main courses were excellent. Slow cooked short rib and Irish duck with Harissa were sublime. Love the short but relevant menu and wine list. I recommend it and will come back. CIAO
5
We had dinner on a Saturday night. Restaurant was packed and service was busy. But there's never a time we needed to call out for a refill of water, removal of plates or asking for food to be served faster. Everyone was attentive and doing his/her job with great pride. Special mention to the maître D, Maureen, who is exemplary at her job, and always smiling as she walked past our table. Food was exquisite and service was prompt. My friend has been to Cure a few times and she sings praises all the time. It's my first time but it won't be my last. Thank you for the great experience
5
Best dinner ever! Am absolute must. Chef is sensational and staff brilliant! First course started on a high and the rest of the menu continued to climb higher!
5
Great concept. Honest and fine quality dishes. Perfect for all who wants to be in a great ambience, lovely service staffs and great chefs.
5
Second time at Cure . Must admit it is always great.
Fusion food using western and asian ingredients . Very recommended.
4
dinner here always flavourful and fulfilling. had the 3 course, and it was more substantial than expected. great snacks too
5
Chef A.Walsh and team, amazing food and very consistent!Bravi!
Enjoyed every dish and wine pairing. Service good as always. Keep it up team Cure!
5
This is my 3rd visit. Each time this restaurant continues to impress me with their creation.
Reasonable lunch for 2,3 or 4 courses to meet different needs.
5
Went with wifey for dinner. Diners have a choice of 5 or 7 courses, "omakase" style. Dietary restrictions are well looked after as I'm allergic to seafood (excepting fish). Totally enjoyed this superb meal. We last had a meal produced by Chef Andrew when he was at Esquine where the genre is more Spanish tapas. At Cure, it's become more French-inventive without the distinct tapas label. Wonderful and innovative, fresh, excellent. And pricing is not as expensive as one would find in other similar high end restaurants. There is also a wine pairing option - I didn't take it but I will the next time I visit. The pours are generous unlike some other establishments that really are stingy with their serving. Worth noting that the menu will change with the season and produce available (although I believe some are signatures which tend to be retained).Absolutely recommended
5
A regular haunt that never fails to impress, and the monthly changes in the menu keeps me wanting to go back for more.This months treats on the tasting menu include a wonderful duck kofta dish and snapper served with humus and cauliflower.The desert selection has an outstanding milk, honey and lavender dish.As ever Chef Andy walks around and serves as well as prepping, and front of house is the ever smiling Tim Dopson who does a wonderful job with the drinks - have one of his Old Fashioneds, they are the best !At S$110 for the tasting menu, this is great value and you will not be disappointed !
5
I visited for lunch, solo, and was seated immediately. I'm not sure about the dinner menu/prices but there is a lunch offer that has two courses for $30 or three for $40. This includes bread and an amuse bouche. It's probably not a place to eat if you're feeling super hungry or are wanting super local food, but it's good if you enjoy trying new flavour combinations and textures and like pretty presentation eg my starter of pumpkin granola included frozen raspberries and a creamy dollop of burrata (cheese). Slight gripe: I had forgotten about tax and didn't know I'd be charged $10 for a bottle of mineral water so what was meant to be a $40 meal - I had three courses - ended up being $60. But that's still probably cheaper than what I'd pay in Melbourne for a similar experience so it didn't bother me too much
5
The food was a cut above most restaurants. The portions were on the small side but the quality shines through. The tasters and complimentary dessert prepared by the chef were exquisite!! The bread was heavenly with the bacon butter. The beef was fabulous. Melt in the mouth! Parsnip purÃ©e delicious! A very pleasant experience.
5
Nice and cozy ambience
Yummy and interesting food
Friendly customer service
Reasonable price
Worth to try
5
Food was exquisitely prepared presentarion and taste. I highly recommend this restaurant. Will be back with more clients.
5
Great food. Great and bold Flavours, loved the 72 hour short rib ! Nice to see the chefs working , coZy environment too !
5
Amazing dinner with friends at Cure. The food is great and especially the meat is amazing. Slow cooked for 72hrs... you don't need a knife to cut it. This is really a great place! Well done Cure!
4
It's a business dinner, foods was good, service was good as well, wI'll definitely go back again and introduce to others.
5
Andy Walsh, chef and patron of Cure is a true culinary genius who deserves to be spoken of in the same breath as the other great chefs who have come out of the UK and Ireland in recent years. His chefs tasting menu which changes every month showcases his culinary talents perfectly. The dishes are perfectly crafted and display imaginative and cutting edge gastronomy. Each dish challenges the senses and often brings a smile to your face, making you look forward even more to what is coming up next. A true gastronomic journey worth taking
5
I just took my wife out to Cure today and we had the Autumn 2016 course. Oh boy! That was a journey to the space of taste and I think I never had this taste sensation before. My wife is overwhelmed by this place and totally happy sharing this night on Facebook and WeChat - that's the best indicator it was great. Fine - that experience is not cheap but totally worth it
5
A little late making our way to the restaurant due to Street closures on Saturday evening, but upon arrival we were greeted by name and made us very welcomed. The degustation menu was simple to decide so we went with the 5 course meal. We could see that each dish was timestakingly prepared by the chefs behind the counter. The menu flowed well paired with glass selections of Sancerre and Bordeaux wines. Each dish was well presented and reminded us of artwork. The tastes were quite unique and somehow blends well together as individual dishes. The fois gras brulee was perfectly done and a favorite. But the hit of the evening was the rich irish chocolate with basil moss dessert. We'll definitely be back.
5
If you love it when the boundaries are pushed with food presentation and how the different flavours and textures of food can be combined together then you need to aquaint yourself with Cure. We enjoyed a great dinner with friends and we were very fortunate to sit at the chefs table. You get a great view into the kitchen so you can watch the team put together each visually delightful course. The chefs, including Andy the head Chef, will visit the table regularly to discuss each element of the dishes. The kitchen is open so you can still get a glimpse of the team at work from each table in the restaurant. The space is very intimate so it would definitely suit a night out to celebrate a special occassion but I suspect it would suit larger groups too. The team are very friendly and the chefs do make an appearance at other tables in the room really making it a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Tim at the front of house does a great job of welcoming you and getting you set for your experience
5
The team at Cure know how to take care of their guests. The service was friendly and knowledgeable, bringing out course after course of delicious, refined food from the amazing kitchen. It would be hard to define the cuisine, but knowing the chef was Irish there were playful nods to his country in many of the dishes, it was fun game trying to identify them. Beautifully presented, perfectly balanced, well cooked food all the way
4
Love the hamachi appetizer and the short ribs beef. Simply delicious!
Would love to give 5 stars but the dessert were too fusion modern for my liking.
4
nice decor, good culinary choice, chefs are busy to prepare in front of you. Try the short beef, cooked 72 hours at 58 degrees.
good choice of wines.
5
service like you where at home friendly, warm ...... the atmosphere cool chilled focused on the kitchen where Andy and team preforms their miracles with food.... wine list extensive able to take you somewhere else
....................
in the end a masterpiece consumption

Unique Flavours with a twist. Very small restaurant, must do reservation. Attentive floor service & Chef with a smile.
1
Quite possibly, 2 of the worst meals I've had in Singapore over the past 16 years. Was taken here twice by friends (most reluctantly, the 2nd time) and not one of my dining companions enjoyed their meal on either occasion. Chef skills are clearly there, but the menu and food pairings are totally disjointed. On my second visit, 3 of the diners sent 3 out of 5 courses back almost untouched. Chef also clearly hadn't watched what was happening with his diners, as he came and gleefully asked us how we had enjoyed our meal - clear sign he hadn't paid attention to the 9 un-eaten dishes that returned to his kitchen!! I longed for a juicy burrito from Muchachos across the street my whole meal!! Plenty of other very good and much more affordable dining venues in the vicinity. Give this one a miss!!
3
There's no doubt that the chef is skilled and what arrives on the plate has plenty of technique. The food was perfunctory and polite/minimalist but not memorable.Steak tartare and short rib were both ok but serving portions, esp for the latter were modest. There was an attempt at some veg (I recall samphire and enoki) but wasn't more than a garnish atop the meat - I don't get the no veg thing, at least offer them as sides. My dining companion had two fish dishes, mackerel followed by a piece of white fish - edible but freshness was questionable.On the other things, bacon butter was nice but combining bits of bacon with butter isn't really gastronomy. The free nibbles were all fine but I'd honestly prefer not to have showy things I didn't order and for the kitchen to focus attention (and value) on the actual dishes. A procession of free nibbles feels passe although I'm sure certain diners will be impressed by it.The service was good/friendly and the dining room is intentionally understated. Overall whilst I didn't hate anything about the place I left unsatisfied which is a shame. Imho Maggie Joan's does this much better
3
Went to Cure for a romantic dinner for two. Was hoping the place would have a "cool" vibe, along with great food. First, I must say that for me, the feeling of the place is more important than the food. I was disappointed by the look and feel of the restaurant, or rather, the lack of feel of the restaurant. It seemed... new? Something was missing - perhaps heart and soul. It has an open preparation counter where we could see the chef preparing the same dishes, over and over again (there is a very limited menu). Yes, the place is unpretentious, but it is also unidentifiable.The food was OK, for the most part. The appetisers were very good, the main courses were more style than substance (very small portions), and the desserts were OK
5
The first time I came to Cure was during a scout for a corporate dinner in the hip Keong Saik area with a friend. We were both in our post-workout outfits (full length tights, sneakers) and got shooed off by at least one place (*coughTipplingClubcough*). I hate fancy-ish restaurants that are pretentious, e.g. charging for bread and/or water, or being annoying about attire. Also, these tights cost $120. As long as nothing is hanging out, I'm not sure what the problem is. The folks at Cure are none of those things. I knew they were nice. I knew I had to come back!I'm so glad I did!! This is by far one of the best meals I've had this year. We opted for the signature tasting menu on a Thursday ($88 I think it was) and it was amazing. From the selection of amuse buche, snacks, to bacon butter (!!!), to foie gras creme brulee, to melt-in-your-mouth beef shortrib, to Guinness biscuit. Honestly it's hard to pick one favorite. The atmosphere itself is also amazing
5
We loved Andy's work since he was at Esquina- he definitely brought the vibe to the restaurant in addition to the great food & service. Naturally we followed him when he ventured into CURE and it definitely did not disappoint. Innovative and beautifully executed flavours. The green curry dish was so suprising, that my mouth couldn't believe it. Dessert was equally as impressive- does not let you down. Service was good and friendly. Andy comes by and talks to the tables. Overall a great experience and it is our go to date night
5
This restaurant is cute as a button, imaginative, creative and delicious. The menu is chosen by the chefs but they are very flexible if you see something listed that you do not want. The atmosphere is cosy and the service could not be better. The wine list works wonderfully with the food and the prices are very good considering what a treat this place is for customers
5
LOve open kitchen. This is one of them. I love Chef Andy food. It's a combination of Chef's Jason Atherton and Tom aikens. 6 stars for my heart in one of the best restaurant in Singapore!
4
I stumbled upon this little gem after having drinks at a bar owned by the same person. He mentioned that he had opened up this restaurant, his second restaurant in Singapore so an ex-colleague and I decided to give it a try. It was fairly busy for a Tuesday night and after examining the very interesting menu we decided to stay and they seated us quite quickly. First the presentation was amazing, not too formal and one would say a little whimsical. The bread was served in as small canvas sack which I thought was quite unique. They paired the bread with bacon butter, in essence small bacon bits blended with the butter, a very original take on the classic kiwi bacon buttie! The main course was no less interesting and very well presented. I had the fish, sea bream, and my dining partner had the pork. They both were quite enjoyable and definitely memorable. The service was prompt but not overbearing. Overall, a very good dining experience and a little gem on Keong Saik Road
4
I didnt know what to expect, as the place was reccommended by a friend. The sampling menu is outstanding, on par with great restaurants around the world. The pumpkin puree was delicious, the beef was tender, and everything was very tasty. The chocolate ice cream was out of this world. Service great, but pricey
5
Had a great dinner last night. Celebrated my friend's birthday. The staff responded with a slice of cake and candle. Was a nice touch. But more importantly, food was fantastic. The tasting menu is S$88++ for 4 courses - its a fair price in Singapore where many places start tasting menus at S$120 upwards. The food was interesting, and yummy. portions look small, but dont be fooled. I couldnt eat more by the time I was done with the main course
4
We came here for a double date with one of the couple friends of ours who've been living here for a while. I've walked past this restaurant quite a few times and I've been meaning to try it so I've finally booked this for our date.You have the option to pay extra to try all the food or stick with the menu. we stick with the menu and thought the portion was good enough. Overall service is great and it's a pleasure for such amazing food experience. I only wished there're more snacks dishes like other fine dining places :
5
Not first time of coming here and like Andrews cooking after tasting a while back in Esquina Went for lunch this time and tried the tasting menu with all the extra bites thrown in it comes with makes for 6 crse lunchEnjoyed the Crab dish and the dessert the most and would struggle to fault the others Service was good and engaging, spending time to explain dishes and bring genuinely friendly rather then unapproachable as in some other restaurants.Both wine and menu very reasonably priced Go and try it and enjoy the experience
5
We had the honor of being seated at the chefs table for their lunch set menu selections. The set menu provides different options to select and combine from. Everything we chose to have prepared and served was delectable. Beautifully presented and obviously prepared with a lot of passion and love. The portions were just right for this type of food though some may argue it's too small, it was perfect for us. We enjoyed the heightened flavor of each course and the creativity to bring all theses great ingredients together. I felt happy eating and savoring each dish. It was great value for the money. Cure is lucky to have such talented chefs
2
Goodness. The crab salad was so tiny that I ate the whole appetizer in two mouth (and not mouthfull). It was also overwhelming salty. Even if the portion is increased three times, it will still be tiny. I have never seen an appetizer so tiny. The soup was also salty. The pork was ok (but the two small chunks at 31 dollars) was again insufficient. I cannot understand what these chef owners are thinking of. Feed us as little as possible because we are models who just move our food around? I, for one, need proper portion. So... If u are a model who loves moving your food around a plate without eating it, this is a place for u. But if u are a warm blooded man who wanna eat some real meat after a hard day work, pls go somewhere else. I like my food in proper portions. So I will definitely not be back.
5
I was overwhelmed by the incredible food at Cure! My friend and I took advantage of the Lunch Tasting Menu (at $58 it is a great deal) and spent the next few hours enjoying a delicious lunch in a comfortable and cozy environment.The food was creative, the presentation lovely and the variety of flavours absolutely delicious. The service was flawless. We are going back again next week. If you have not been, you should go
3
Perhaps tainted by our flawless experience at Odette the week before.FOOD | Food was imaginative but lack the drama and finesse of fine dining that keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of the next course. It wasn't bad but for the price range, we expected more from the experience. Memorable courses, the sweet corn croquette, sour dough bread with amazing bacon butter, Iberico Pork cooked to perfection and chocolate sorbet desert (this one hit the high note for me).SERVICE | save the affable chef, service was attentive but almost clinical. They had the tendency of clearing the plates even before you have had the chance to stop chewing. Again a comparison with Odette, the service staff''s enthusiasm for the food served did not come through strong enough. We were waiting for the "I can't wait for you to try that..." eagerness which translates back to ultimate expression of hospitality ie. authentic desire to share something good with your customers.

Seriously good food and good value. Attentive but unpretentious service and modern understated decor. Delicious set menu (does change), good wine list, great ambience. Highly recommend, a special restaurant. Can't wait for a return visit!

Truly amazing food. Very good wine list too. Located in an area to wander too. Seriously good! You get 3 to 5 tasting type courses which work well. No big fuss just great food.

We had a beautiful set menu. We had a great view of the kitchen so there was great plating being performed for every dish. The ingredients of each dish was very small and the plating was like a piece of art. The juxtaposition of all the ingredients caught me at times completely off-guard. There was a dish that was completely out of the world - Tuna salad; pear and green curry. The green curry was very light and not at all heavy. It completely brought a new flavor to the dish. Will definitely come back

Our group of 3 went for the chef's 4 course tasting menu instead of the ala carte menu - excellent value, brilliant food and perfect service. Great wine list too. The chef sent across a few extras from the kitchen which were delightful and yums! Never knew of this place before, tiny joint along the buzzing Keong Saik area, but definitely one of the best places I've eaten at in Singapore. Highly recommend.

There's a set dinner menu on Friday and Saturday night,which we didn't know, but what a surprise ... the food is absolutely wonderful. Portions are small and I didn't have the extra steak, probably a mistake as too much bread and wine. But I haven't had such a good meal in singapore for years. Wine list has something for all budgets. Well done to Andy and co.

With Tim Dopson on the floor and Andrew Walsh in the kitchen, this place is leaving the more pompous and overpriced eateries in Singapore behind. From the moment you arrive, you feel at home. The unpretentious shop house surrounds, the music and the openness of the kitchen make you feel like you are in someone's house rather than a chic restaurant. The real comfort is in the food. It is outstanding. The best food I have eaten in a number of years. Good portions, well paced and brilliant flavor combinations. The venison dumpling and the grilled mackerel were winners for me and with Tim's wine selection, it was a well counseled marriage.The kitchen Team were a well oiled machine and a pleasure to watch. Better theatre than many a show I have been to.if you have not been and you live in Singapore, go. I live over the border and will be fighting the causeway for another round of this cure for all ills

had been recommended Cure by a colleague and stumbled across it one night when out with friends. Restaurant was full but they sat the 4 of us at the bar and had the most wonderful evening. There's a fixed dinner menu (they do check if there's any allergies / dislikes) 5 or 7 courses, we did 5 and were perfectly stuffed. Favorite was the foie gras crème brulee which was superb - still dreaming about it! Chef comes and explains every course to you which adds to the experience. We have booked to go again next month for chef's table and can't wait to taste the new menu

During a recent dinner with a good friend, we both opted for the 3 course menu. I was absolutely blown away by the imaginative dishes and the level of quality. Truly remarkable! What’s more, the great casual dining setting allows for a nice and relaxed meal without it all feeling too pompous.The restaurant has an open kitchen concept and the chefs come to the table to serve some of the dishes themselves. The menu is very well balanced, high in flavor using only the best possible ingredients and well paced. On this visit I was particularly impressed with the venison dumpling!Service is excellent and the chef really does his best to deliver on all levels. This was my second visit, the first being in the first month after they had opened, and I can really say that the restaurant has grown a lot. When Michelin comes to town later this year this will be a definite contestant from some of their stars!My only minor point of concern is, as in so many restaurants in Singapore, that I would like to see some more affordable wine choices on the menu

We stumbled across Cure & we are so thrilled we did. The whole experience was incredible. We had the three course menu with matching wines. Amazing, innovative, delicious food - every morsel was orgasmic. The wines were exceptional, matching brilliantly. The service was spot on. Professional, knowledgable & friendly. Simply brilliant. Even down to the delightful hand cream in the bathroom. They've covered the lot

What can I say?! From the service to the food and ambience.....
top-notch! Will definitely come again! Keep up the good work Team Cure!👏🏽👏🏽

Went there for a couple of times, never failed, food is fantastic and the service as well. We were welcomed with sincere smile and taken to the table while the lady was explaining us the menu.

Found this Resturant in a magazine review and I am so glad we tried it. Modern European food with a twist. Nice staff, service, presentation of the food, complementary dishes and totally new flavors and mixes one couldn't have dreamed of. A great food experience!

Had a lovely dinner here, chose the medium sized tasting menu which was more than enough. Some of the combinations weren't perfect and I didn't like the granites, but the quality of ingredients was excellent and it was pretty delicious. Excellent service.

Visited for dinner off the back of a recommendation from a "foodie friend" and it did not disappoint.A set menu is compiled using whatever is fresh and in season to create a truly innovative menu. It's a place where you can really savour the quality of the ingredients, the thought that has gone into each plate with the presentation and combination of ingredients being excellent.Only negatives would be the rather stingy pour for a glass of wine and the size of the portions. I had to load up on the bread to get full
5
Hard to believe but this visit was even better than my last.Highlights this time were the foie gras brûlée - addictive and blissful. Followed by a superb sea bass with sea urchin foam and then the most delicate pork belly.The chocolate desert was magnificent ......Just book and go !

Chef Andrew Walsh left Esquina in 2015 to set up his own restaurant in the same area and Cure is the result. Have been a couple of times now and both experiences were well worth the cost. Cure runs on a "set menu" basis, which changes each month. Although there is no a al carte, slight changes can be made based on dietary requirements or personal preference, even on the day itself. But with a chef as talented and produce of such quality, it's a shame to change from the set...In addition to the menu, there are always two or three little extra dishes that are thrown your way, and they are a delight. They take amuse bouche to a whole new level. Last night we were presented with a starter plate of duck croquette, sausage roll and crab - all delicious and each with a touch of sauce that complemented and elevated the flavours of each mothful. The bread with bacon butter and cabbage also worth a commendationAs mentioned, the dishes change each month so check the website for the latest menu. As a guide, expect fresh, quality produce and dishes that are packed with flavour, sometimes in unusual but effective combinations. And beautifully presented into the bargain - attractive, delicious small plates seem to be the chef's hallmark, and all gold standard. Absolutely worth a visit

Singapore blows my mind with how quickly its changing and the food scene here just gets better and better, Cure though based in what is fast becoming Singapores trendy food district I think takes the crown.Inventive well crafted dishes at 55++ for lunch its not cheap but value is excellent. The chef is a genius and wish them great success will be a regular stop for me

What a find ! Does food get much better than this in Singapore, or anywhere else for that matter.A friend introduced me to a small restaurant in a shop house close to China Town. greeted by both Tim, the GM and Chef Andy, we were immediately made to feel special and at home.The menu is fixed and changes each month, and what a delight. No choices to make other than how many courses - and what courses !Our venison with chocolate and blackberries was outstanding and the preceding fish courses of salmon sushimi with beetroot was exquisite.The price ex wine is a very competitive S$95/head - wine is at usual Singapore prices and certainly no worse than other places.I cannot recommend Cure highly enough - Michelin star quality food

One of the most "innovative" restaurants when it comes to tantalizing your taste buds. I particularly liked the beetroot cured salmon. The dessert was also spectacular. Even though not every dish was a hit (recommend to order the degustation menu) you can't fault them for trying. Impeccable service and prompt. For special occasions. Worth the price.
5
Wonderfully plated dishes, I just remembered how great the lamb was! If you want to impress a friend, Cure is the place! Excellent and attentive staff. Will be back soon!

cant say more about this resto. food was awesome with a service to match. am sure this place will start getting swamped and it will be fun to see how they face the great challenge..all the best to Andrew and team.

Chef Andrew Walsh has been around Singapore for a while, this is his first personal venture, and what a success it is. The restaurant only serves a fixed menu, but will accommodate if there are things you cannot or don't wish to eat. Imaginative, exciting, even mind blowing food. Good wine list, unobtrusive service. Mr. Walsh, who is very young Irishman, spent a great deal of time with us towards the end of the meal, he is a charming, generous man and I expect to see him go far! When a French foodie praises an Irish Chef, don't think twice, GO

Admittedly, the scene is very crowded with big names at the moment in Singapore. Andrew ran Esquina before, but this is just big time trajectory. He has unleashed his own language in an ever monthly changing menu and I am already asking my bank manager to accept monthly visits. Seriously, this is one of the top 5 restaurants in Singapore, if not SE Asia.

My wife and I have visited Cure on a number of occasions, with Singapore friends and overseas visitors, and have been blown away by just how good Cure is.The Owner / Chef Andrew Walsh creates a monthly degustation menu consisting of innovative, stunning to look at, dishes that deliver equally on flavour. Using only the best produce and some cutting each techniques you'll be delighted and surprised at every plate.The excellent food is complimented perfectly by attentive, knowledgeable, and professional service - headed by Front of House Manager Tim Dopson.Whether you live in Singapore or are visiting Cure should be high on your top 5 restaurants to visit when eating in town

We had a group of eight at the chefs table this last Friday to try out this new place. I could go on and on about the incredible mussels, oysters, steaks and amazing desserts, or I could just say that this is one of those few places that comes around once in a while in Singapore that makes you thankful that we live in an amazing city with a vibrant food scene that just keeps getting better. I would also add that the place has great service and a fun staff. I can't wait to to go back.

I received a very nice message to join Charlie, Jenny and some friends for dinner last Thursday We had a special chef's menu, and multiple courses and a nice house red which was really enjoyable.We were lucky enough to be invited to the captains table and we watched all the chefs are at work, what was very clear is that they are well organised, very calm under pressure ( as restaurant was full) and each member of the team as clear understanding of role and responsibility.For each dish the food was small serves so we were able to try many things with the oyster dish being my favourite Really nice evening
5
Clearly a very accomplished kitchen producing some of the best food in Singapore for remarkably good value. Set menu (it's online and changes monthly) at around $95 for five courses but you end up having about seven - reasonably priced by any standard for cooking of this quality. Best thing about this restaurant is the laid back vibe - fine dining without the hushed tones, tablecloths and lectures about the food. The wine list is balanced and well priced and the service is excellent. The cocktails aren't too bad either

Went for Lydia's birthday and had the set meal which is excellent. Almost all of the dishes went together well which they often don't when chefs get creative. The wine sommelier knows her stuff and was understanding when like a tool bag for the first time in my life I sent back the first bottle I ordered.Very good service too which is rare in Singapore

Lunch with clients. There were 7 of us. Unfortunately the only table large enough was next to the kitchen which made it a tad noisy. The table was a little tight as well. No more than 6 can sit comfortably. Anyway, I digress. The food was excellent. My starter of beef tartar was very good but the Scottish salmon I had as my main course was just out of this world. The dessert of milk, honey and lavender was unusual but nice. Great service. Will definitely come again soon but maybe in a smaller group
