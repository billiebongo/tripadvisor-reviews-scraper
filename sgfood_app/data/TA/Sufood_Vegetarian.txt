Great vegetarian food only been served here. Taste n presentation of dishes are superb. Although a bit noisy place as it's in mall. If u are little hungry or looking for small bites then these is the place.

Our family visited Sufood over the weekend for lunch. The restaurant is centrally located and serves healthy and tasty vegetarian and vegan dishes. My only grouse was that some of the salads and juices are too sweet. The interior is quite classy and the waiting staff are knowledgeable and very helpful. Kelvin, a Management Trainee in the restaurant, in particular was outstanding.

Great location as it was situated at the Wheelock Place. A busy restaurant during dining hour so reservation is needed to avoid disappointment. An open concept restaurant with the water fountain just next to it. It is situated just next to Nam Nam Noodle Bar.We ordered a 5 course set meals and it was a just right portion. On top of that, we tried the Star Pizza which turns out to be delectable

This place is an experience, so if you're after stock standard noodles and rice, might not be the place for you.However, if you're a bit adventurous, then this place is great. For the palate and the shear fun of eating there.Before I go any further, just be aware this place is a vegetarian restaurant.We went there twice with family and it's great. A good place for a first date as well. Nice ambiance. Not sure if they have a festive menu but if they did, definitely a Valentines menu wouldn't go astray.Love the juices available and that entree.... even though it's the same thing the second time I had it the flavors seems to come out a bit more.The mains were great too, the pizza's fantastic and that baked rice.The main thing about this place, not really for kids and I wouldn't suggest they change. This is definitely a place for the grown ups to have fun.Now, I've flagged this place as family friendly but it's really for your older kids. Mine's about 3-4 and although they enjoyed the food, you're not going to get that full enjoyment sampling the food if you're battling a couple of unruly kids at the same time. So its really a reflection on the staff's professionalism that the place is also children friendl

After a busy spell of weekend shopping at Ion Mall we wandered into Sufood in Wheelock Place for a late lunch with hungry kids in tow. Where we delighted by the uniquely engineering vegetarian offerings here? The kids loved the Green Salad and the Noodles dish. We ventured into Mediterranian Skewers and Baked Pasta. The place offers a set meal of a soup/ salad, a main dish & one drink for a modest 15 Sing $. The place was lively, young, casual with lots of laughter and ever smiling staff! Definitely worth a visit on a busy shopping weekend
