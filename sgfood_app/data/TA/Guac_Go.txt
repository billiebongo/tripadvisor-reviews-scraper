You will make your own selection of the ingredients and dressing. I always put an avocado on the top and have delicious organic apples in my salad, homemade honey-mustard dressing is my favourite!

For $12 a bowl, their beef bowl is super tasty, fresh and filling! A friend brought me and this is definitely a good place for fueling up affordably.

I had the Cajun chicken salad which came chockful of ingredients- salsa, almonds, sweet potato, lentils and generous scoops of guacamole. Taste was light, they probably only added lemon juice or vinegarette, but with these ingredients, you probably don't need heavy dressing. Very satisfied.

Guac & Go is the perfect place to go for lunch when you're craving some super-healthy food. With "guac" in the name, you can count on guacamole or avocado being featured in many of the dishes. All of the ingredients are fresh and crisp. The menu (slightly different in the store than on the website) features salads, wraps and sandwiches loaded with greens, beans, and grains. You can order a salad from the menu or create your own - choose your ingredients and they put it together for you. The menu is rounded out by smoothies, teas, and cold-pressed juices. Sometimes when you are traveling you tire of restaurant food and just want a healthy salad. Guac & Co. fills that need nicely
