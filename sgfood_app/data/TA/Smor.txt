Smor is trying to be like the other healthy protein salad places around raffles place. However, their choice of ingredients and menu is really lacking innovation and is quite boring in my opinion.

Tl;Dr Really good food, a little bit expensive - 100% worth the price.I had a smoked duck with wild rice and some beans (don't rember the name)The duck was juicy and flavourfull, the rice was also flavourfull, one of the beans was warm - with the same oil used to make the duck - and it was extremely good, both flavours combining very well, the 2nd bean was normal, a good bean al natura. With all that I had a tea (only have seen it in here) with a good taste, good after taste and good complexityI do recommen

Great Food-Bar! they sell fresh and very healthy food for a fair price. i paid 11 dollars for a big tasty salad with sweet potatoes, Avocado, chinoa and some vedgetables. I could have added the soup of the day gor just two dollars. the owners are very caring and helpful. also they use a part or the incomes for chairity

A little pricey for what you get. I paid $9 for a small root vegetable soup, an open face beef sandwich (on a very thin slice of bread) and a small side salad. Emphasis is on small. Food was ok, what I expected from a deli, but the value delivered, when you compare to the other food outlets in the building, is a bit disappointing. Think they may have to re-evaluate their value proposition
