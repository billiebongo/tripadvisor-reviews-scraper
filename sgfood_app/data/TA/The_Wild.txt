Visited this eatery with eatigo 50% discount. First off, there were flies circling our table. Ordered calamari with some mushroom soup, pizza & some main courses. The calamari was bland & rubbery. The rest were just passable. Wouldn’t return again...

Made a reservation for lunch on eatigo. Service excellent, waiting time for the food reasonable. Ambience relaxed, casual and chic.The garden salad was a disappointment but the spicy crab pizza made up for it. Having read a review online about the pizzas being greasy, I asked for less cheese and more tomato sauce and it came out just right. The crust isn't made by the restaurant though so taking points off for that. Location is not bad; opposite Haw Par Villa and there are several bus stops and the MRT close by.OK with discount but otherwise, expensive for what it is.Service very good though

We went to Haw Par Villa and wanted a place for lunch close by. After reading about this place it was a no brainer!!!We ordered the fish and chips and the smoked duck pizza. They were both beautifully presented, fresh and so tasty. The chips were the best we have had for a long time - not greasy. We would love to have tried the Tiramisu but didn't have room. Next time though.The service was some of the best we have seen and experienced in Singapore. Quick, efficient and very friendly. The cafe is very modern looking with lots of greenery, lovely and clean and comfortable chairs and tables.We could not fault anything about this place. It was a great lunch so thanks to all the staff

We have been to The Wild on a number of occasions and have always found the food and service to be excellent. While it has become our first choice for a special occasion, the prices are very reasonable so it is also a place to go when we just fancy something Italian (their pastas are fab!), or a steak (none better in my opinion), or their many fusion-style dishes that are so delicious. They have truffle-chips (fries) that are a 'must have', as is the crispy pork (or the lamb shank, or the sea-bass, or the ...!!! - just writing about them makes me hungry!!!). For those with a sweet tooth, the home-made deserts are also a must - make sure to try their tiramisu. And all of this is served in a relaxed, friendly and 'open-to-fun' manner. Sometimes it is wonderful to be surprised, so ask them what they recommend that day - this is how we found some of our now favorites

Went there as a group of 8, had many different things, went several months ago so forgot some of the dishes, I DO recall the pasta alio olio, also, the truffle fries, and the platter of sausages, meat, fish. Sighhhhh.. EVerythings was lovely... the truffle fries ,,, hmmm yummy..... Nobody had any complaints about the food! My vegetarian friend loved the pizza

The wild is a superb italian fusion cafe/bistro nestled within Westway (makeshift, or so I call it) mall right across how par villa mrt. Shan who picked her love of baking from her mum, makes these innovate and interesting desserts or rather twists on existing desserts that, that alone should warrant a visit. When the sweet tooth comes a-knockin', dish up one these lusciousÂ desserts. To make it all the more perfect, their food is great, quantities perfect. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who appreciates a good meal at an affordable price. Do give their Tom yum Dori a chance.

Run by two siblings in their 20s and both culinary graduates, this casual restaurant dishes out good fusion Italian food at reasonable prices. Our dining experience was enhanced by co-owner Shan's enthusiasm and professionalism in serving us. The passion the siblings put into this venture assures diners that they will enjoy both the food and attention.

This place serves AMAZING everything. We had the pesto with grilled prawns - pesto saucing was really nothing that I have tasted. Pizzas were amazing - slight thin crusted with generous fillings! Lamb Shank was melt in the mouth. All for a decent price of 16-20 bucks per dish!Not forgetting the best Tiramisu ever eaten and the cutely decorated premise!

We have gone back there for many more times since our last visit in Dec 2016. The food is still consistently well prepared and tasty. Love their fish dishes in particular. Service is good when Shan is there. I only hope they serve beer on tap but I may be asking too much from a cosy restaurant.

- Faces the common area of a sub-urban mall. Open space and mini playground for toddlers to potter around- Comfortably-spaced seating area with lush fresh plants (birds of paradise etc) for outdoor ambience- Chef owner-managers. Good food made with heart. We had the pork knuckle (better than brotzeit et al); go see the other reviewsGreat place (airconditioned with parking/toilets) particularly if you wanna stay away from the crowds and franchised mall restos
