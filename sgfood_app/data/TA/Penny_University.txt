Cute cafe with nice coffee. Went on Sunday ard 3pm and was full. Ordered full english breakfast. On the oily side and burnt bits on sausage & ham. Not worth the original price.
5
Come here for the coffee. The aroma of the coffee fills the place. The rest of the menu and cakes are just side dishes.
5
Good choice of pastries and good quality brunch food style. The cold brew is amazing so is the hummus... Linited seats outside if your interested in terrasse.

First time and was looking forward since walked past this place few times. Few customers during the visit, but managed to mix up orders anyways twice. Food was normal.
2
Unfriendly service, waitress menu(mic)-drop on our table. Poky cafe with no walkway for customers to walk between seats. Bloody mediocre food, to think I travelled all the way from the other end of Sg for it. WILL NOT RECOMMEND AND NO RETURN TRIP. Not a value of money meal

We went there for afternoon coffee on the 3rd day of chinese new year as many other cafes were still closed. Ordered both hot coffee and cold drinks (coffee & chocolate). The iced coffee came in a tiny cup of just 200ml (including the ice, mind you) and the chocolate drinks came in ready mixed glass bottles (also tiny). The hot coffee came in a normal sized coffee cup. Tastewise the coffee was decent (strong enough) but we felt cheated by the tiny servings.

This was the first place that I went to when I visited Singapore for breakfast and the breakfast was really good.. loved the Eggs especially the Egg Benedict and the coffee was great too The ambience of the place also catches ones eye and the place has been really nicely and interestingly done u

I have been going in Penny University for a while. I went recently after having not being there for a few months i noticed a few changes.Â  It might be only me though it looks like a few places I've seen expand with more space. It seems that the portions seem to have gone smaller, service is very average here now. Good coffee and the most unique food here is the Turkish eggs.

Was recommended by a friend.Muslim friendly selling Halal western style food.I had the full breakfast set. It was delicious.Also had the Toffee Apple Cake/crumble. Pretty nice too. Just missing perhaps a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.I ordered Iced Vanilla for drinks. That was my only disappointment. It was just water with vanilla powder mixed into it. Perhaps it could be made better if milk or ice-cream was added to it. But thats just my preference

We visited during lunch time around 12pm. The cafe is situated next to a junction and a busy street, but easy to find. It's really small with limited seating available indoor and hardly any seats outside when it's crowded. Luckily, we were able to get a table for two.The atmosphere is quite noisy when crowded and lighting is a bit dim, making the place look more like a restaurant bar than a cafe. As I mentioned before, it gets very packed when it's crowded and we had to squeeze just to get to our table.The service was so-so. It was so busy and crowded that it took us a while to get our order. And it was really tough telling who were the staff working there as they did not wear uniform.The food we had was delicious! We ordered and shared a Penny's Mac & Cheese and a Grilled Cheese Sandwich. We specially enjoyed the mac & cheese! The coffee wasn't too bad. We ordered a cup of latte each (which isn't specified on the menu) and it was quite fairly priced as well.Overall, we had a great visit! The only issue was that it was super packed, noisy and suddenly there were drilling noises next door (the owner/staff did nothing about) which made it so difficult to enjoy our coffee and even have a proper conversation. We might visit again just to satisfy our cravings for their Mac & Cheese though

This place was closed and furniture were stacked aside when I visited with my friend. Don't know if they have shifted or what..

Penny University is a top-quality artisanal coffeehouse at the east end of the East Coast Road restaurant district. It is the best-quality cafe we have found in Singapore in months of searching. It also serves a high-quality breakfast. Strongly recommended.
4
A neighborhood cafe that serves great breakfast all day and good coffee. Every cup of brew is worth the wait. There are all kinds of home baked cakes and you simply has to be early enough to get a slice of the ondeh ondeh cake! Great place to hang out and meet friends but could be crowded most of the time especially over the weekends. Inconsistent customer service with lots of inexperienced waiters n waitresses.
4
If you like good real coffee go to this awesome spot on East Coast Road. The feature real food espresso and cappuccino and iced variations. They have very tasty cakes and a good breakfast and lunch menu. Good to enjoy, meetup, have a meeting or just relax
1
I was appalled by the service attitude.1) When placing the order, I was told that the item would only be available from 9 am onwards. I had to tell them that it was 9:15 am. 2) Despite repeating the order thrice, the wrong order was served. 3) When informing the waitress that it was the wrong order, she merely told me that it was what was on the receipt and walked off whilst I was still explaining what I had ordered. 4) I eventually went up to the counter to tell the barista about the incorrect order. They finally took the wrong order back but second time it was served, it was still wrong. I wanted an espresso not a long black.Disappointing, disrespectful and simply disinterested to hear out a customer. All that over an espresso. If you don't know what a single espresso is, don't open a cafe!You've lost a client
2
This place passes itself off as yet another boutique coffee shop. However it fails to deliver, the coffee is bland, the food is typical "instant" blandness, and the staff are not particularly welcoming. To top it all off the place is hopelessly crowded with tables and chairs. Not much to recommend this place in a crowded market of coffee shops when others really do try to please their patrons. So maybe I would return if it cost a penny, but for not other reason.
5
Small and tired place but this is a style they have chosen, interior is not very attractive and fresh. Different kinds of tables and chairs and benches. The biggest problem is that too many people come and stay just to hang out and talk there, so two times we had to leave because there were no free table. But! Food and coffee are really fresh and good though not very cheap. W came here every morning for a breakfast, because we really liked the food and coffee quality. Turkish eggs and Chia smoothie were the most delicious things
2
The menu is broad and the brunch items anyway are tasty and interesting. But they have several service problems. I've rarely seen a server or cashier smile, one in particular, a cashier, always frowning even on a slow day. They do their jobs but they don't look happy about it. We used to go twice a month for brunch but have noticed the speed at which the food comes out has gone down, too, even on a fairly slow weekend morning. They seem to be oblivious of this. Has a neighborhood vibe, lot of regulars, but they seem to not notice or care that their servers and service are not great anymore. Lots of places in SG charge $5-$6 for a small cup of coffee or hot chocolate, although theirs is pretty small. But charging $2 for one piece of toasted bread - one piece - because they only provided one small piece with their Turkish Eggs, which is tasty but is supposed to be on toast - that's just petty and small-minded. I gave them three chances to not charge me for that, but three different people just smiled and said sorry. Well, that $1.50 just cost you $800+ a year from my family, enjoy! Alternatives with better service include Domaine on Tanjong Katong, several others at Siglap corner, and of course stand-bys like ABC in I12 Katong, also Rabbit Carrot Gun and Butter Flappy Flaps or whatever just down the street
1
Food is ok, bland and a bit tasteless. Not worth the money, and far better options in the area for brunch type food.Worst thing about this place though is the staff who are downright rude. We had to send one of our dishes back, as it really was just so dry, bland and inedible and they refused that it was or offer a substitute. Just kept saying they had made the dish for ages and not had a complaint. Avoi
2
I've lived around the corner from this place for 3 years but never dined in until now. Firstly, it's annoying having to walk through the haze of cigarette smoke from the hipsters who hang outside the cafe in order to get through the door. Staff are miserable, they're not friendly and they walk and act like zombies. Menu isn't extensive and doesn't inspire much appetite. Food was poor - small servings, unexciting dishes and bland
5
Ordered a ice coffee and Spanish omelette. Both amazing and delicious, got two outdoor tables and plenty of seats inside. Staff also are very friendly to explain the menu and their coffee. Will come back again!
4
Freshly cooked all ingredients and the taste is really good. Even the bread taste to be freshly baked by them. Price is slightly high but worth for the taste. Filling and different experience. Not much impressive theme of deco though.
4
Busy place on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered coffee and cake, and managed to get a table. The cafe serves decent enough coffee. Good for chilling out with friends.
5
Whether it's for brunch, lunch or a caffeine fix, this establishment delivers on all fronts.
The quality of both fare and fermentation is straight up superb!
4
I always enjoy the coffee at Penny. My favorite dish is the turkish eggs.The ambiance is pretty nice. The staff is very customer centric.I really recommend this place if you are in east coast and you are a coffee lover...By the way, they open early morning..
3
The coffee is so heavenly good, but the staff should be trained or changed.It feels really disappointing when the waitress brings you 3 times wrong order, doesn't apologise for that, speaks so quite so You don't catch what exactly and looks at you like at peace of you know what

Friend suggested to meet up for coffee here. Almost missed it as it is within a row of shophouses. First impression? Quiet, cosy cafe. Guess it's because we went after the lunch hour. Got ourselves a booth table at the end of the cafe. Quite bad choice as we can hear the kitchen door keep slamming shut. Looked through the menu. Not a lengthy list mind you but filled with rather interesting "cuisine". Settled for Salmon with guacamole on open bread while friend had a mushroom and spinach on same. Ordered the truffle fries and instantly regretted it when we saw it served. In a huge bowl?! Tucked in. Not bad. Munched slowly while waiting for the mains. Hot and crispy. The mains were not a disappointment either. Both delicious to boot except I wish it could be bigger or of two servings.Of course we have to stuff our face with the dessert. Opted for Avocado cheesecake and Toffee nut and Apple cheesecake. Accompanied by hot white lily tea and hot peppermint chocolate. Fantastic way to end our outing.Service was above average. Cheery greetings to welcome and send off. Good place for a repeat visit when time permits

Came here for a Saturday morning breakfast with my two girlfriends. We'd heard quite a bit about the place, with some mixed reviews. As it turns out, I was rather underwhelmed by the food, especially since there is no lack of excellent breakfast/brunch options in the East Coast area. I had the poached eggs, while my girlfriends respectively had the French toast and the big breakfast. The big breakfast was huge, but it didn't seem to be anything special - regular toast, frozen hash brown, and what were clearly supermarket bought sausages. My poached eggs were ok, but I found the bread to be exceptionally crusty. The French toast was the best dish of he three - it was tasty and the portion was generous. The one thing I did enjoy was the matcha steamer I had - creamy and delicious. Don't think I'll be back for breakfast, but I'd like to go back to try the cakes.
5
Muslim owned cafe that's very serious about their coffee. No cappuccino but you can order espresso with milk in different sizes. Looks like cappuccino to me. They make is hot, the way I like it. We are here on a weekday and they are full, which is a sign of their popularity
4
If you decide to come here, be prepared parking is a big hassle so take grab or uber.As stated, this is a nice place to chill out and have coffee, it's basically manned by a young group of guys and gals who give you decent service, though during peak hours waiting time could be Long so be prepared, it's so nice to come to a cafe that's not manned by foreign staff, nice to hear singaporean English Service is acceptable not great but I don't blame them as the poor staff have to face very arrogant singaporean and foreign customers aside who are no joy to serve at all, I don't believe in the customer is king crap, waiting staff have every right to be treated with dignity as long as they are not arrogantIt's at a nice location along East Coast road so come by pick a corner and have a nice coffee and cake but the food is not awesom
4
Love the cafe's ambience. F & B is just as good. Perfect location in the east to hat or work on your laptop. Wide tables...not like some compact places around. Will go there again for sure.
4
Since Penny University is a artisanal coffee house, one expects good espresso! Luckily they make a good espresso. Be sure to try the sandwiches as well; grilled cheese is awesome. PU also has a nice selection of cakes.
5
Great place for a breakfast and for coffee conversations. With a good spread for breakfast, its a preferred family jaunt! Ambience too is really cool and the folks there are very friendly
4
We come to Penny every single weekend without a miss. They are making mean chocolatine (pain au chocolat if you're Parisian) or chocolate croissant for people in general, but it runs out so fast.. They could have more batch on weekend really. Coffee is okay. Selection of cake is appetizing with some hit and miss, yuzu cheesecake, avocado cheesecake, tiramisu are less than average but earl grey and lemon cake are nice. Buttermilk waffle is soggy (we took away they should have thought of not drizzling the chocolate on top). French toast once came flooded with maple syrup but they willingly replaced it to us and we have been ordering it every week. Sandwich quality are consistent.Contrary to some reviews here, I think the service is nice they're always friendly and there's always this atmosphere of your neighborhood coffee shop. It could get really crowded on weekend's morning.

Cafe is understaffed with orders taking a long time to arrive. The poached eggs on my English breakfast is overcooked and not runny. Decent variety on the English breakfast though. Too much vinegar was added during the poaching of the eggs resulting in a lingering sourish taste. The eggs benedict was still runny but still had a sourish taste. Coffee is decent.
1
I ordered food for 3 of us, both friends food turned up 10 minutes after order. I noticed mine was taken to the table next to us as I saw this myself but waiters denied it when I asked if that was mine given it looked like what I ordered and came with my friends lunch. I waited a further 40 minutes and still nothing, and so did the other guy on the table next to ours. My friends being well mannered waited for my lunch to turn up, theirs must have gone cold by the time they actually started eating. Bearing in mind my food still hadn't turned up. They finished their lunch before mine even turned up. To top this off I had to ask for my drink to be served as they had forgotten it as well. No communication by staff on the whereabouts of my orders, they simply didn't know so just went to check and never came back. I didn't eat in the end as we had to go, food hadn't turned up even though I asked again. I've never had such bad service. This is clearly a bunch of teenagers doing a Sunday job that have never been given the training or knowledge on how to work in F&B industry. Food that did turn up wasn't too good either...so I'm told

Penny University is managed a group of young adults who are able to bring out the passion that the cafe hopes to bring out to its customers. The deco is simple yet attractive. The use of other accessories to serve food and beverages serve to add spice to the aroma of the experience. My only oops is probably that the serving size for the drink is relatively small compared to the market average standard. Parking around the vicinity can be a challenge as the cafe is located in the street of East Coast. The feel of the place is similar to Assembly Ground at Cathay and Chillax at Serangoon.

Arriving in this visually hip and appealing cafe, we went in for a bite to eat. It was buzzing with customers and that got us excited. We ordered food at the counter and a muddy espresso with cold milk and a strawberry & vanilla iced tea. As we sat down, slurping outer delicious drinks we waited with anticipation... The wait lasted for 50 minutes, with no staff interaction. We could count the number of tables waiting before us and sensed their frustration too.After a long wait, 1 of the dishes arrived. A burger with Cajun fries. I heard it was tasty and satisfying.I ordered the Macaroni & Cheese with minced beef. The portion was pretty small and it was mixed with sliced chilli chicken sausage and not minced beef.Overall, the food drink was OK. But the service was incredibly slow with no service interaction with staff.We wouldn't recommend this place at this time. Let's hope they take on board this feedback and improve as we'll be loving locally soon

This was my first times having brunch with one of my girlfriends, and it turned out to be fantastic. For this review, I will state the pros/cons of coming here:Pros: Free water (My first impression of eateries always increase exponentially when they offer this basic necessity)Great service (they don't chase you out when you're done with your meal -- making it a great place to sit down and chill with your friends)Pet-friendly, I guess (only for outdoor seating -- and this is only because I saw a lady sitting outside with her dog and sipping on a cuppa).I always thought Penny University was just a place for brunch. To our surprise, the menu changes at 12pm for a lunch and dinner menu! Fantastic!I had the french toast set and my friend had a breakfast platter of some sort. I didn't think I'd be full. But I was! And it was quite an awesome meal! I really enjoyed myself and would be going back soon to get my belly some of their lunch.Wide selection of drinks (juices, pots of tea, mocktails) and desserts (although we were too full to try any). We spent about $17- $20/ person (includes a meal and a drink).Cons:Parking is limited (apart from the probably 15 slanted lots at the side of the building, there is not much availability of parking)

Good coffee, in the style that I get back in Perth, is hard to find in Singapore. And while I like the local coffee found in the neighbourhood shops, at Toast Box, Yakun Kaya, etc (my favourite is a stall in the far corner of Shunfu food centre), I sometimes hanker after the coffee I get at home.I met some cycling friends at Penny University a couple of years back and enjoyed the coffee so much that I told myself another visit was in order (it was packed then). It took a while but I finally made it back on a quiet, midweek morning. It's a nice oasis at the slightly quieter end of East Coast Rd.The coffee? It's terrific. Forget the stuff served up at the big chains (you get slightly better and cheaper at a McCafe in a pinch); this is the real deal. Good coffee made by people who care. I tried the Muddy Expresso (which is served over ice) and it was full of flavour. The latte was good too. The prices are fairly friendly too.I'm told the breakfast and cakes are good too but that will have to wait for another time. When in Singapore, I'm more inclined to the local breakfast offerings

Laid back trendy café on East Coast road. Good coffee and cakes, plus a decent breakfast/brunch menu.

Of all of the local cafés that I've visited, Penny Uni scores best in terms of taste and environment. Their nice décor and interior is simply lovely. Located in the quaint neighbourhood of Joo Chiat / Telok Kurau, this café will definitely satisfy your eggs benedict and coffee cravings as it did for me. From the first time that I visited them in 2012 till now, their menu has improved. I'm a fan of their Spiked Muddy, an espresso with gula melaka (palm sugar) and their eggs benedict. Their Turkish Eggs isn't that bad as well, it was too strong a flavour for me but if you're into that kind of thing then I think you would love it.The plus point for me is that is Muslim owned, hence Halal. As a Muslim, my choices to café are scaled down. However a recent boom of halal cafés has expanded my choices ... but Penny Uni will always remain on top for me!If you're in the area or simply want somewhere to unwind, Penny Uni is the place for you

Heard quite a bit of this restaurant, thus decided to go all the way from west to east to find this place.Food - relatively good, ordered English breakfast , bread was a little hard. Eggs were well poached, sausage was good.Drinks - iced chocolate was fantastic, but the iced chai was a little plain Desert - was good, tried Oreo brownie , no sign of Oreo though.Now I have no idea why would anyone open a restaurant and discard the idea of having chili sauce when you have truffle fries in the menu as an option.I honestly feel that chili and tomato sauce are a must in any fnb restaurants Service was okay. Staff seemed a little rushed thru to take the order.Overall, classy and very laid back. Do head over for the delicious eggs
4
One of the better coffee shops/cafes, especially in this area. It's small so it can sometimes be hard to get a table but the food is always reliably good, the cakes are great and the coffee very good. Reading some of the preceding reviews I'm surprised at the remarks - especially the service. It's fine; when it's busy the staff tend to focus on keeping up and maybe aren't so friendly but when it's a little quieter it's much nicer.Definitely a good place to pop in for a nice coffee and some brunch
1
The girl at the cashier was appalling. One only needs to order anything to get the muddy service. We were considering our options and she was impatient. Then we were confused with what muddy was. She said it was marketing, and when queried further, she said it was just what it was. We ordered the so called muddy coffee to try it out. Coffee was bad, chocolate was worse, service was simply muddy.Utensils are recycled from used jam jars, I wouldn't come back. There's enough mud under the grass outside

All day halal breakfast options are very rare in this city.Penny University has good options for brunch as well as for lunch and desserts. Although the menu is small but serves the purpose well.We ordered eggs benedict, chicken burger, hot chocolate, chaistreamer and earlgrey cheesecake.Eggs benefict was spot on. Poached eggs were nicely placed over toasted bread and a ham slice along with a side of salad tasted delicious. Chicken burger with a combination of spinach tasted good too which was served with the side of fries and salad.The highlight of our meal was definitely earlgrey cheesecake, one of the creamiest abd textured one I have till date. Although hot chocolate and chaistreamer tasted average.Surely coming back to try more options from the menu, highly recommended

My friend and I decided to give the place a try after a morning walk at East Coast Park. We were there on a Saturday morning, around 1120am and already there was a short queue outside. To be fair we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. However do note the queueing system, put your name down on a piece of paper and they will call you when there is an available table. Thanks to a couple before us who told us what to do. Otherwise we would just be waiting and waiting.The restaurant is really quite small and the seats are very close to each other. Therefore it is inevitable that you get knocked by the wait staff moving around or people moving in their seats, which really irritates me. It being a weekend also meant the food took a long time to come. The portion was a little too little and honestly after our meal, we had to hop over to the coffee shop next door to fill our stomachs with the famous Geylang Hokkien mee.So unless you are there in the vicinity I don't think it's worth the time to purposely visit the cafe. In fact, the place is so noisy when its full its hardly conducive for any meet ups

I live in the west area of Singapore and have the unfortunate luck that all the cool and most raved about cafes are in the east side of Singapore. #singaporewestsidefirstworldproblemseh? Hahahaha!So having a wide range of cafes to choose from, I decided to choose Penny University as the cafe to drop by while I was in the neighborhood. Sad to say, I was a tad bit disappointed. Main menu was a fail. Service was rather stand-offish. Menu rather illegible also, time to change your menus! Ambiance is kinda normal. Pretty much every other cafe in Singapore has the same concept now. Pretty crowded, no queuing system. So just stand wherever you feel like and hope for the best that you're in the right line. So the only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because of the cakes. Really superb. That's all. If you're going to that neighborhood, grab a few cakes for takeaway and eat somewhere else! For that same price, I'll get a good plate of pasta some other cafe down the road

I visited this coffeehouse on a weekday brunch time (11ish). In my opinion, the location is not that easy to locate even though it is along the road. Partly because it is between some shops and pubs. I am surprised to see the whole place full house by 12pm on a weekday. Once you are inside, you will be pleasantly surprised with the furnishings. Simple but unique. Every piece of furniture is not matching but that makes the place interesting. I was abit lost as the servers there were busy with other business. I could not figure out if I needed to wait for a seat or take one myself. So service is not that ideal.One of the more popular brunch order is the EGGS BENEDICT WITH SMOKED SALMON which is fairly price in my opinion as I have eaten similar yet expensive eggs benedict. Serving portion is relatively small for a XL sized man. But the taste is good. Eggs are nicely cooked and smoked salmon is passable. They serve cold water but you have to collect your own cups and pour your own water from a corner. However, I must commend that the cups may not have been washed and dried properly, A cup that I drank from had the awful smell from the stench of a t-shirt that has not be dried entirely. The muddy ice coffee has a very normal tasty nothing in particular but it is rather expensive given it is served in a small jam jar. I would recommend you to go there only if you happen to pass by there. No need to take the trouble to travel from West to East like I did. Parking can be an issue if you are not familiar with the area there. However, I made a call to them and the server directed me to park at a lane behind the coffeehouse

Okay, I spent 6 years living in Switzerland, frequently travelling throughout France, Germany, Austria and, yes, Italy, trying out different coffee shops. I've tried coffee shops in various other parts of the world, too. I reckon I'm kind of an aficionado and I am by no means a generous critic. Coming to Singapore has been a trial, not least in trying to find a decent coffee shop. I've followed all the popular review sites, traipsing around steaming Singapore - in vain.Serendipity! I was cycling along East Coast Road back to Joo Chiat, where I live, and caught a flash of 'Penny University' in my periphery. Give it a go, I thought... And on my doorstep I have happened upon the best little coffee shop I have tried in Singapore. I'll be taking my wife there for breakfast on Sunday.As for the comments relating to customer service, they have a point. But to award a ! on that basis is simple churlishness - these are young people just starting out, and I feel it is more a matter of low self-confidence than technically poor service. That said, the staff might benefit from a half day awareness seminar on customer expectations. I'll deliver it free, for an open account in the coffee shop!By the way, of the very many coffee shops in Singapore I have tried, I have never given higher than a 3

It's not exactly difficult to find but difficult to get parking for drivers. Has hipster looking decor but small and crowded during peak periods. The price is very high - I paid around sgd42 for two persons. I wouldn't mind it so much if the food was good. I heard a lot of rave reviews especially about their eggs benedict. But maybe I went on a bad day. The sauce was too sour and the egg tasted too much of vinegar. My sis ordered a large breakfast set and the meat was very oily and the egg also tasted very much of vinegar. I did enjoy their drinks - hot chocolate and a rose flavoured tea. But for the price and the very small quantity, it doesn't seem that worth it..
2
Wow, big ideas for this coffee bar, but things need work. People need to be served their food at the same time (happened on two occasions) and better quality utensils are needed. But otherwise this is a great venture with great coffee and an adventurous menu...

Dropped in for a coffee and to check this place out, this week. The cafe was busy given it was a weekday morning. Ambiance is trendy, laid back, chill. Had a large (7oz) Expresso with milk ($5.50) and a slice of lemon drizzle cake ($5.50). Coffee was good but not great. Cake was exceptional.They had a good selection of newspapers and magazines and I would imagine it would be a great spot to catch up with new and old friends. Thought it was just a touch pricey for the area. But I liked it! Will return

I revisited the cafe for the second time recently with my husband after my first visit when they newly opened while back. This last trip was prompted due to their online voucher promotion. We ordered a sandwich with beef I revisited the cafe for the second time recently with my husband after my first visit when they newly opened while back. This last trip was prompted due to their online voucher promotion. We ordered a sandwich with beef patties = the side of the meat was burnt, just like how food are being burn during bbq. We didn't order well done though. There were many cakes selection, didn't know what to choose, ended with a chocolate cake. And it tasted horrible. I'm a cake lovers, have tried all types of cakes throughout Singapore. That was the first time, my husband and me had hard time swallowing the cake. It was so dried! The texture was .... don't know how to describe it. I wasn't sure if they knew, to help them improve. I told the wait staff about there cake need some improvement. She was extremely kind, came back and offered to have us choose any other cake as a replacement without us expecting it. I didn't trust my own choice, but let the staff to be their own judge. So a strawberry short cake was presented to us. It looks beautiful, unfortunately the texture of the cake tasted just the same as the first one. I barely able to finish it. After all a disappointment despite the staffs were quite friendly. The only thing we like the most was their coffee. We ordered cappuccino. It was flavorful, the coffee and milk proportion was just right.Conclusion: Just go there for coffee but not food. Suggestion to the cafe, consider a replacement for your cake maker/ baker. Too much cafes competition out there, they really need to work on it. Good luck! = the side of the meat was burnt.

Reasonably priced all day breakfast. Coffee is good but food is very averagePoached egg is overly sour (too much vinegar used in poaching process) and overly cookedAmbient - good and unpretentious. I had the 1st table in the morning and the table was stained.crew service - acceptabl

I had coffee etc a couple of times when I was in this area, the people who worked there were nice enough the coffee was ok but nothing special, still think there are better places for coffee in this area but hey its decent enough for me, the kid serving us was quite funny so that all adds in

After much hype we finally visited Penny University. Very crowded and we had to wait 15 mins to get a table for 4. But I can totally see why they are so busy...... fantastic coffee (best I've had in Singapore) and good quality honest food and an impressive desserts spread. Staff is super friendly and warm too. We could see the owner walking around and chatting with most customers. He clearly knows his customers well and this is what makes the place extra special because its run by people who really care about good service, good customer experience and good products. I understand it has been a good couple of years since it first opened and the decor is a bit rough round the edges (slightly dirty walls and wobbly furnitures), but the great coffee and food and service more than makes up for that.A suggestion: you could improve a bit on the queuing system. Maybe an area for waiting customers to sit outside instead of standing. Or provide more outdoor seatings.All in all, a great place and highly recommended. And judging from the customers' behaviour there, I am not the only one feeling like this. Will continue to visit them

Visited this place on the 12th October following a recommendation from various family members.Coffee is average, nothing to shout about, ambience, not much difference from the old time singapore kopitiam. If this place is good, god help you with the cafe scene in Singapore. Service is non existence, waited for a good 20 minutes, finally shown on to a shared table with 4 other parties, sitting in a haphazard way and we're just left on our own. The chap who allocated the sitting was pacing along the front of the cafe and back to their servery, doing absolutely nothing, but ignoring us completely, this goes on for a good 5 minutes, till we finally decided to do a self service order. From this experience, we might as well patronized the local kopitiam, as this is how penny university portrayed it sel

Recommended by a friend as one of the 'must-try coffee places', we decided to pay Penny a visit. We weren't disappointed. Arriving early is a must during the weekends, as the crowd starts building up by 9am for breakfast. The coffee was good and the breakfast fare - scrumpdeelicious

I found Penny University bustling with the morning crowd on a Sunday morning. And this was at 8.45am. Luckily I was able to find myself a comfortable table. By 10.30am, the crowd dwindled down to just a few tables. Throughout, patrons were streaming in. Breakfast was Scrambled Eggs on Toast, a slice of the Honey Almond Cake and the refreshing Moroccan Rosebuds tea. The cake was light and refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The portions were generous for the price paid per item. Orders are paid for first at the counter.The friendly staff provided prompt service, so definitely a place I would come back to again and again.

Went here twice because it was so good. Great coffee, good food and good atmosphere.
Food is reasonably priced. Don't expect comfort. You won't get it as it is very popular and seats and tabl are crowded in. I will be back.

Cramped and perpetually crowded all the time. We ordered for peanut butter and after eight ice cream sandwich which were not too bad. Saw almost everyone ordering for brunch, Eggs Benedict in particular. Made a mental note to try that out next time.

Nice little cafe with great coffee, bakes and brunch offerings. A neat minimalist concept ideal to while an afternoon away on east coast rd.

We live just in the area so thought to have a bite and coffee over the weekend. One Saturday when we walked in it was overly packed (lunch hour) and seemed like a long wait so we went back another weekend. We ordered the food (a salad which was original and nice) and some coffee, which went rather smoothly (we arrived about noon) and we did manage to grab some seats this time! However, the order of fresh fruit juice and pain au chocolat never arrived even after half an hour after ordering. We asked for a refund and walked out - ok nice interior, a lot of hype and all, but the service is just bad...once you have ordered, the staff will forget about you....looks like they have forgotten about their website too, because it's no longer there!

What first comes to your mind when you think of artisanal coffee house - good coffee, welcoming ambience, service with a smile, and relaxed, right? Well, I'm right now sitting in penny university, and we were greeted by a surly Christie (and of course no smile). After ordering coffee, I asked for a sandwich, only to be rebuffed with a condescending 'kitchen is closed' while disdainfully pointing me out to an inconspicuous sign saying the same. What a 'wonderful' welcome! The coffee I must admit is excellent. But I'm not coming back here anymore. I'd rather have sub-standard coffee with more pleasant service. The butterscotch tart is worth trying.And affordable pricing as well in my view. The ambience is not too bad too. Industrial like flooring and grey painted walls with rustic looking furniture.

Small coffee joint definitely worthing the tour if you're craving for freshly brewed arabica, tasty breakfast plates and fresh-from-the-oven cakes & scones!Affordable, tasty dishes makes this place a really nice spot to chill on a lazy morning. If you're a sweet tooth try the Snickers tart and the Millionnaire bar, you wont regret it

This cafe can easily go unnoticed in the long string of restaurants that line the siglap road, given its size and location. But the long queue in front of the cafe speaks for itself! Quickly, what I loved about the place- - the look and feel of the cafe is very new age in small ways, the interiors, the magazines to surf while you are waiting for your food.- talking of food, the selection of items on the menu are very different from other cafe's. I had the turkish eggs and this was nothing like I had tasted before! Try it to found out! A great discovery that I am definitely visiting again. Some things to keep in mind- this place does not accept reservations and the queue outside ia long. Try to arrive early to skip long queues. Also, the place is pretty crammed, so not a great place to come with a large group

Fresh coffee in 3, 5 or 7 ounce cups. 5 ounce was perfect. Get a 3 ounce if you really love strong coffee. This place gets a little too crowded with people waiting outside while it gets really noisy inside.This may not be an ideal place to have a long and nice chat with your partner or friends. However, I will return for a good caffeine fix

Penny University is a located in a nice shophouse area. The coffee is excellent! The food selection, quality and food prices are also good. Friendly Staff and quick service. One Challenge seems to be the quite long waiting lines on the weekend which made me reconsider multiple times to stop and wait for a coffee. I recommend to improve the waiting line system and for example introduce a specific coffee-to-go counter

Our family with two little kids really enjoyed our meal at Penny University. The decor is unique yet homely. Vintage furniture and friendly staff.If you want something unique, that serves halal food to boot, this would be a nice place to spend an hour or so
