This is a great little coffee shop, bistro and bar. The staff are always friendly and helpful. We stop in every trip to Singapore. For a hot coffee or cold beer.

This is a nice place in Chjimes with a good atmosphere
Good choices, tastes and service. Great for lunch

Visited the outlet at the Southbeach complex today for a quick takeaway ham and cheese baguette for lunch. Service was efficient and friendly, and payment by paywave is allowed (which saves hassle with coins). The baguette was tasty but a little small.
4
We ordered the cappuccino and mocha, both coffee are good and aromatic. Coffee is a must order item if you have chance to visit there
5
it;s good joint for meetings.. for those who are tired of star bucks.. I liked the service and cofee

Nice ambience with great food. Enjoy the laid back design, nice place to chill out alone or with a few buddies.

Visited the outlet at MBFC yesterday for a coffee after lunch. Plenty of seating in this outlet and the coffee was really very good for a chain store. Took a while to be served with a bit of a line ahead of us, but that's to be expected in this location at lunchtime

Went to the Tanjong Pagar outlet.As compared to Starbucks, the selection is small and the portions are smaller while the prices are about the same. The coffee is particularly disappointing. It doesn’t taste like regular filtered coffee, more like watered down espresso. Yoghurt is only available as plain and you’re only allowed to buy it if you also buy a pastry.Not recommended

Had lunch with my family of four on a Sunday afternoon. Service was fast and polite. The menu were simple and unpretentious. We ordered four pastas and they were all good. The Beef Ragu, Aglio Olio with prawn and Chicken Schnitzel. All the dishes were well prepared and tasty. Please tell the chef he/she did good work. I would come again

Visited Dimbulah Cafe on South Beach Tower. Not a very big cafe but the outdoor seating is nothing short of perfect. Perfect for business casual discussion or even catching up. Price is about the same level as Starbucks. Quality of the coffee and selection is quite complete. If you're into real coffee, give this place a visit.
4
We started the year off with a lovely brunch at Dimbulah Cafe at CHIJMES. It's cozy and quiet, hidden amidst the bustling CBD area.

Had a family lunch here. Great service, delicious food! My Son enjoyed himself so much he clamourded to return.

Recommend the Grilled Furikake Salmon on Potato Risotto, Australian Beef Burger and Seabass & Prawn Croquettes!
5
.....and it is grown in Australia!
Double ristrettos in every coffee served means amazingly smooth and delicious coffee - every time.
There are a number of these in Singapore.
Visit any one of them!

I have visited several branches and I am never disappointed. Quality and service is consistent, coffee is great. If you are a regular get a reward card to collect free coffees

The place wasn't very crowded and service was great! Not forgetting the food was good too. The sausage platter was good enough for 4 to share and the truffle fries was a bit too salty for our liking. It would have been great if it was shoestring fries instead of chunky fries.
5
The Food is well cooked and must order the Prawn Avocado Salad. Farmhouse Breakfast and Aglio Olio Spaghetti is delicious too. However the place need to have more space for diner who love to sit with air cond room. As the morning sun is hot. Overall is a nice visit
3
Made a reservation but when we arrived, no one attended to us (only 1 lady behind the cashier) so we grab any available seats. It was not crowded so we are fine. Indoor seating is limited and small but ambience is not bad. Breakfast selection is very limited. Food and drinks quality is just normal. Nothing to rave about

Good, tasty, reasonably priced food and nice location. I wish this place had come up in listings of eateries near Peninsula Excelsior Hotel as I would have gone their on the first night. It is located inside Chijmes, a converted church grounds that takes up most of the block between Victoria St (continuation of Hill St), Bras Basah Rd, North Bridge Rd and Stamford Rd. There must be in excess of 20 restaurants within Chijmes. From the street there doesn't seem to be much to identify it. I walked in one entry to check out a restaurant and saw a list of other restaurants - went outside- nothing; went inside along a corridor - many restaurants. On the way out discovered more restaurants.

We always eat at Dimbulah Bistro, Cafe and Bar when in Singapore. It is an open air, non-smoking oasis (in our experience this is just about unique for an open air venue in Singapore) with a terrific relaxed atmosphere generated by friendly and attentive staff and a great playlist of 50s and 60s songs, whose tunes are instantly recognisable, whose lyrics are understandable and which invite singing along. The menu is varied, prices are very reasonable, the food quality is excellent and service prompt and responsive to the diners' eating pace (i.e. not rushed). Most recently we greatly enjoyed both the weekly chef's special of chicken and the Menu du Jour special of soup (outstanding mushroom), one of the four pasta main course choices and NZ ice cream dessert. The 1664 draught beer is cold and the wine list consists of well-recognised NZ (majority) and Australian wines.

We caught up with some friends and family over brunch. Great Aussie-style brunch items. The farmhouse breakfast deserves special mention. Full bar and great coffee. Service was friendly without being too obtrusive.
4
This Australian Coffee joint has a couple of outlets in Singapore CBD as well, and the coffee is fresh and robust. Cookies to go are great too!
1
Table was dirty, table was unsafe (falling off its base) .... In the end we left. Can't rate the food.
5
Relaxing and nice place to chill out! Happy to come and chill out w my Husband and Friend. Will recommend you to our friends.

Great food at reasonable prices, good atmosphere for a quiet scene. Service was a little inattentive.

Came here for a coffee after lunch today (to the outlet at One Raffles Quay). I opted for a cappuccino which came out looking quite good but was unfortunately just a bit cold. I prefer it to be hot not luke warm.
4
The coffee was great and so were the cookies. We stopped at this cafe in between meetings and found every thing refreshing. The service with a smile, the hustle and bustle and more importantly the convenience of the location. there was no pressure on us to leave the cafe even though it was crowded so we coulld relax and enjoy the coffee and wait till our next meeting. I would definitely re-visit - Dimbulah again..

Been here a few times, when you can finally get the staff enthused to serving you (when they finish talking and social networking) you get served a luke cold beverage. Beer is hot and their response was to tell me that most people send it back and have something else. Absolutely unacceptable and hence why the Ladies night is totally void of customers. Note to owners....if you own a beer joint...Store the kegs on a cold room (not under a table at the end of the bar), clean the lines regularly and keep clean cold glasses. This is just another place to meet until you find somewhere better. Could do so much better

This was our second visit to Dimbulah during successive stays in Singapore and we were pleased to find that the relaxed atmosphere and semi-outdoor environment, complemented by cold beer and great hot food hadn't changed. We had the grilled salmon and the spaghetti, prawns and garlic. Both were simple, well presented and delicious. A great spot for a reminder of Oz, friendly service, good, inexpensive, food and cold beer (or other drinks). We'll be back next time we are in Singapore

My lovely wife came for a weeks visit to Singapore and I enjoyed taking her around town in this lovely city. Came to Dimbulah in the Chijmes. Lovely food, a few good daily offers and great offering on wines. I hate ordering a glass of wine and you can only see a drop at the bottom of the glass. Here they offer 250ml, 500ml as well and really great pinots and NZ blancs
5
Lovely cafe bistro. Only ate breakfast but excellent and very reasonably priced, enough good which set us up for the day. Situated in Chijmes over the road from Carlton Hotel.
A must for breakfast
3
Scrambled eggs and smoked salmon with coffee for $14. Get yourself a toasted sandwich for $5.20. No wifi is a bummer, however if you are staying at M Hotel, you can get your wifi from across the street!
5
If you are in the area and want a quiet, open place in which to enjoy a coffee, or a cold beer, Dimbulah is the place. Salads and light dishes make it a good choice for lunch.
5
We love this little cafe!! It is in a lovely setting, and there is seating both inside and outside the cafe in the courtyard. Service is good, and the food is great. We had breakfast in here one morning and we also had lunch.

Dimbullah used to be one of my fav coffee joints but in recent months, the quality has dropped significantly. We frequent the outlets at Chevron quite frequently but one of the waiters/ cashier is extremely rude - he is curt and would bang the utensils rather loudly as if to univite us from the establishment. On one recent visit, all the customers were simply looking at the staff and his other two colleagues didn't even dare to speak up. On the whole, there are better choices out there and mgt shld take a look at service quality

Searching for an inexpensive eatery near our hotel we discovered "Dimbulah" in the Chijmes centre off Bras Basah Road. The welcome was genuinely friendly and we sat at one of the tables which is open to the sky but which can be protected by an awning if rain occurs. The Bistro has subtle Australian references but food is in both European and Asian styles. Prices do not include the usual service charge; a welcome change which allows gratuities at the discretion of the customer. We both had the grilled salmon special, recommended enthusiastically by another patron. After ordering we were advised of a short delay in serving due to a large party which had just preceded us. We were provided with a large bucket of chips, on the house, to keep the hunger pangs in control while we waited. The slight delay was no issue and allowed us to enjoy our wine and beer at a relaxed pace. Both the chips and salmon, with salad, were excellent. Ambience was relaxed and we enjoyed watching the passersby. Prices were very reasonable. Service very good. Highly recommended

This café is located at a corner entrance f CHIJMES. If you are familiar with CHIJMES, they are located at the side entrance, next to the SMRT headquarters building, facing Raffles City. I had a business meeting here and I had the Iced Capucinno, which costs $5.50. I usually have hot coffee, but on this occasion, the iced coffee is what I needed with the heat we are experiencing. Coffee is nice. The staff is friendly too.A nice place for a quick ‘pick-me-up’

Decent coffee advertised as Australian coffee, however i wouldnt go that far. I had a flat white. It was good i wouldnt say great coffee. I had some take away coffee for myself and a colleague who had a cappucino and he was not enthralled but not too upset either. So overall average as the coffee is pretty expensive as well

Two days of meetings in the CBD & taken to 2 separate Dimbulah outlets so you'd anticipate great coffee ... but no. Day 1 short Macc was bitter & so we only had the one coffee & moved to a different cafe. Day 2 was to involve lots of coffees so wanted to start the morning with decaf ... but they don't do decaf !! My latte was huge with no flavour ... think Starbucks ordinary.As a coffee outlet, you'd think they'd get their signature right, but no.Simple breakfast were tasty & good value.

Although I like this location, the coffee and the great bar seating, the service is average. I was sitting at the bar working on my laptop and the server behind the bar was tinkering with the taps at the sink...the taps somehow came loose and water splashed all over my laptop--screen and keyboard, and all over my trousers. My laptop was covered in water. I realize it was an accident. The server said a very shy "sorry" and gave me napkins to mop up my keyboard and screen, but....that was it. She didn't ask if the laptop was still working, she didn't apologize sincerely more than once and also, she didn't even offer me any complimentary anything as a gesture of goodwill. Had I been her, I would've apologized several times AND I would've invited the customer for a free coffee or croissant or SOMETHING "on the house" to make the customer feel valued and cared for, despite the water accident
