This is a very casual yet very professional restaurant. excellent service, food is amazing and exciting.

They have two omakase menu and we opted for the premium range. We were not disappointed with our choice. The chef surprised us with every single dish, from the exquisite plating and presentation to most importantly, the taste of the food. Freshness in the ingredients and use of ingredients in ways that we never tot could be possible. Definitely worth the price tag
5
We had been here several times for business and family lunches and the quality of food was never disappointing. The chefs take great pride to bring out the flavours of each dish (including side dishes) to ensure consistency to delight our taste buds.We tried our 1st dinner here and were impress with the presentation; each dish that was served is an art (too pretty to be eaten). We enjoyed the 1st dish equally as we did the last. We'll be back

I have been here quite a few times and I have to say this is one of the best value for money places for Japanese Omakase. Be it lunch or dinner, the Omakase is decently priced. Quality of food is very good. Do make a reservation beforehand

Had patronized this cosy restaurant in Mohamad Sultan Road for lunch, so decided to bring the family to try their dinner.It was as good if not better than the lunch, with 10 courses of beautifully presented sashimi, oysters, Wagyu etc. My son, who doesn't take sashimi had a specially prepared cooked selection of omakase himself.The staff are very attentive and friendly, and knowledgeable about the origins of the ingredients, a nice touch if you enjoy knowing where your food comes from. The chef was also moving around to ensure his guests are satisfied with the meal. Very personable service.The restaurant has large end to end mirrors tilted on the ceiling opposite the sushi counter, which affords those diners a view of the chefs as they prepare the food even as they sit with their backs to the counters.Good quality at a decent price for a omakase meal in a relaxed, friendly environment. We'll be back

The experience of "Omakase" gives one an idea of the sheer splendour and attention to detail that Japanese cuisine offers. Every plate most of which are over a hundred years old is artisan and crafted with thought behind presentation and love for diner. The clay and pottery has embellishments according to seasons. The chef who has trained for 20yrs or so is a food artist who has a great understanding of designing and producing the most delightful mouthfuls with an emphasis on minimalism. As I approached this haven of hidden experiences tucked away on Muhammad sultan road...the subtle yet beautifully curated restaurant with unparalleled Asian and Japanese hospitality made me believe that I was in a cave of wonders. My own personal Genie the chef ....putting together with deft precision herbs, flowers, even flecks of gold leaf and various wonders of the sea in the most exquisite crockery that I has ever seen. The maitre'd Melissa, a very welcoming and informed lady, started explaining the seasons and their bearing on this craft. My ambivalence started drifting away as soon as I sat down to experience and enlighten myself off the subtle nuances of this cuisine. It is known that a grand master is one who performs with ease and without expectation of applause. But what I felt in my heart was a standing ovation for this time preserved craft that looked so simple yet so complex, seated in a place with unassuming grace and history. For those of us who are ever scared or shy to try something new, I would like to recommend "omakase" is a must try. The very word means " I trust in you".....Hachi is an exceptional experience

My friend brought me here for lunch yesterday and I really enjoyed the 8 course Omakase set lunch esepcially the live oyster, foie gras chawanmushi and tope grade melt in your mouth wagyu beef. All dishes were nicely laid out and delicious. Ambience and service were great too :-
4
Only Omakase served here.The Flavours and ingredients were extremely fresh. Plating was immaculate. The Chef can make special dishes to accommodate if you don't want something.Only gripe was the main dish which came with unagi and Wagyu. This was about the 7th course and it was rather heavy and struggled a little to finish. Better to have broken this course up into 2 with a refresher like consommÃ© in the middle.Nonetheless, it was a great experience and will go back
4
Came here for lunch after a gap of quite some time. Opted for the bento box which consisted of some salad, beef, sashimi, tomato, tempura, rice, pickles, miso soup, black cod and some pork belly. Really very tasty. Total cost ended up being around $55 each including the tea, service charge and taxes
5
Some business colleagues from Japan brought me to this restaurant and I have to say it was the most beautifully presented food I've ever seen. It was almost a shame to eat it! Pretty amazing to look at and wonderful flavors too.
4
Took my relatives out to lunch and make sure it was good food. No disappointment here with top quality traditional Japanese food washed down with Saki. It is expensive but worth it and presume dinner is even more costly....
5
Went there to celebrate wedding anniversary with my hubby after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor. It was indeed excellent. The omakase dinner has a choice of $168 or $198 per person. We took the $168 set. You can opt for $198 if u want more & better sashimi. Every dish was indeed beautiful, both in terms of its presentation and its quality. Many premium ingredients were used and they paid good attention to the finest details. I was very full when I reached the 7th to 8th course, with 2 more to go. The staff were most polite, attentive and friendly. Saw their lunch menu which is not overly priced so will check it out for lunch soon. And will definitely go back again when we have important dates to celebrate in the future.

Have been going to Hachi for many years. The japanese chefs have changed over the years but the quality of food and service continue to improve. The omakase here works as it is delivered with fresh quality well cooked food at a price that gives value. Many new Japanese restaurants open and try to jump into the singapore scene by charging higher prices. Hachi gives full value for the money. Food quality is paramount and Hachi has it. The ambience and decor are also well planned,making the restaurant very comfortable to be in. Looking for a lovely Japanese omakase dinner ? Go to Hachi. You will be pleased that you did.
5
Had the dinner omakase. The expectation did not fail. The attention to detail for each of the dishes was impeccable. The "master chef" prepared the sushi / sashimi dishes with lots of pride. The "surprise water" was really a surprise. To think of the trouble to derive of the surprise water ... it sure was a surprise. Great to bring love ones for a quiet evening here. For those tight in the wallet, i would recommend you skip the standard restaurant/eateries to save up for this one. Definitely a repeat visit for me in future
5
Had the set lunch omakase beef menu. Staff very helpful as I had to change certain seafood dishes given my allergies. They were very accommodating. The food was well presented, the plating was outstanding, and the food was top notch delicious. Compared to some of its competitors, Hachi prices, while not cheap, do represent good value for money given the foods one is served. Dinner set meals are more than 2x the price - have yet to try.
5
I first had lunch here with a Client and it was totally appropriate for a business meal. Tables full but easy to talk - its a small, sophisticated-but-restrained restaurant with well-spaced tables. My second visit today was with my husband for my birthday and we both had the omakase seasonal lunch. The food was sublime, the ingredients authentic, fresh and spoke for themselves. Watching the chefs prepare sashimi, sushi and the other dishes is always a treat at any good Japanese restaurant and Hachi is no different in this regard. The service was attentive but not pushy, every request was promptly attended to, the dishes explained, and when we asked to slow the food service a bit so we could savour, they did so. The food is extremely good value, as is the sake. There's a pretty good wine and sake list, so for those of you into sake you'll see some good ones.French wines and beers are a bit pricey but given the food prices and overall quality and ambience this is understandable. This is pretty typical of Singapore (200% + markup) but the wines and sake were very well chosen.There are two private dining rooms, so if you have a function or larger group this might work for you.We will be back

Exquisite produce and flavours, stunning presentation. All dishes clearly created with love and respect for whatever died to be on your plate! A sublime dining experience. I will go back again and again and again and keen to try lunch, apparently the Bento is out of this world and terrific value
5
Our first time here and we had an amzing dinner .The food is very seasonable and flesh. We never tried such a great restaurant so far in singapore. I would like to recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a good japanese restaurant in here. Am sure I come back
5
Had dinner with friends. This Fine Dinning Japanese Omakase Restaurant can be busy on weekends. So reservation is recommended. Every course was beautifully presented. The food here is suitable for people with very refine palate. No hearty meals here. Service was top notch. Worth many return visits
4
Great food in a light and traditional layout. Japanese chefs prepare food with attention to detail you'd expect, fresh ingredients and great presentation. Lunch sets much better value - Toro donburi, and Chirashi very good but won't go wrong with anything on the menu.
5
Their Omakase lunch was fantastic. We choosen the one with 3 cuts of Wagyu beef and it was all delicious. Service was very attentive and the whole set-up is very nice and clean. Sure will be back.
5
Service- The restaurant's staff were all very well trained and attentive. Prior to arrival, we made a couple of changes to our bookings and they were very accommodating. Food- The bento set that my mum ordered was very value for money. Also, there was a variety of items which was good! My sister and I had the Omakase lunch set where we were served 7 courses @ S$68++/pax. All the items were freshly prepared at the kitchen counter and were all well marinated. Overall, a very satisfying lunch and great find. We will definitely be back
4
Been here 3 times now. Their House Omakase is very good at SGD 68. If you're a beef fan, then Wagyu Omakase lunch at SGD 88 will suit you well. Their huge Oyster as the starter is orgasmic! But I'll not have their Chirashi Don set again which is at SGD 68. I feel more satisfied having their House Omakase. Is a great place to take visitors/client as ambience is quiet and staff is not intrusive. But do make a reservation! Would love to be back soon

We had dinner 3 times over 2 months but only took this current opportunity to write about his place.Overall a very solid presentation of true to Japanese style kaiseki meal. The dinner set cost between $128++ and $198++. Personally we tried both set meals and found the $128++ meal was more than sufficient.The lunch set is $68++ and $88++ and one of the better Japanese lunch deals in town. Hachi set meals include various tasting menu and the portion are just right. The dining ambience is very modern and fits the restaurant style.The kitchen is staff by 3 Japanese and 2 locals and serves very fresh and authentic style food preparation.The current chef ( Kosumi San) hails from Tokyo Ryugin restaurant (one of the top tier restaurant). If you don't have the time or opportunity to eat at Tokyo Ryujin, Hachi would be a good alternative at a lower price. This is our current favorite fine dining spot in Singapore... Besides the regular hawker fare

I went for a business dinner of 5 people. The food is quality traditional Japanese sushi, sashimi among other wonderful seafood delicacies. We enjoyed a few bottles of sake in the private room. Service was high quality as you would expect from a high end Japanese establishment.A one off in my opinion
5
Tried this out last night for Dinner. Omakase meal with 2 different prices. We had one of each and both were excellent and justified the different in prices. The dishes are beautifully presented and the food fresh and seasonal. It was all very very good and finished the meal satisfied without being overly stuffed. Service was very professional - attentive and knowledgeable on the details of each dish. I hear lunch sets are good value too if you are in the area. Will be going back
5
At this fine dining Hachi restaurant for dinner, we had the 11-course Omakase set for $128++ per person. The dinner was well prepared by Executive chef Tadashi-san originally from Kyoto. For this price, you get a very satisfying meal comprising the freshest and top quality grilled wagyu, associated sashimi & sushi, appetizers, starters, chargrilled gindara cod, tempura, buta shogayaki (kurobuta pork), baked oyster and dessert. Each dish was beautifully prepared and presented. Nice ambience and excellent service too. Will definitely be back soon
5
This was my first attempt at omakase and I was a little apprehensive at what might be served and if it would agree with my palate. After the 1st dish, 2nd dish, 3rd dish.... I was unstoppable. Well, I did pause a few seconds when the oyster came out as I don't eat oysters at all but for the spontaneity of it, I tried a little and it was actually very bearable. In fact, it was so good that my husband gobbled down his and my share before we could remember to snap a picture. Every single dish was an art and superbly oishii. The dinner for two came up to about $400 with sake and I thought it was reasonable for that level of dining
5
Food is exquisite, immaculately presented and friendly service. Small restaurant, but intimate and romantic with a great view of the food preparation. Everything is exceptionally fresh and innovative and we will keep going back. The menu is at the discretion of the chef you just inform them what you don't eat - then enjoy the wonderful surprises to come

A-la carte menu of the day is served course by course until you say stop :) Quality of food is excellent.
3
On the my first visit, it was a bit disappointing. Other than the fantastic sashimi, rest of the dishes were mediocre. I am told that we need to go there with someone who is familiar with the chef.

Simple & Nice Japanese Home Cooked Food!

I've been to Hachi several times now but this most recent visit in late July was the best so far. Service quality has improved considerably and the food quality and selection this time around was of a very high standard. It's not particularly cheap but then for 10 courses with the quality of food involved the price represents reasonable value for money. I'll be visiting again

Comfortable dining room and very pleasant service. We entered feeling that something special must be awaiting us seeing how serious the host was about the fact there was no a la carte menu and we had to choose the Omakase.Slightly disappointed by what we felt were dishes that though seemed inspired, lacked finesse. For the price you pay for the Omakase, it's not exorbitant. But there are just better meals out there. Maybe we caught the wrong menu
5
Hachi is probably one of the pioneer in Singapore that introduced the concept of Omakase (set meal that you will leave it to the chef to decide). Full 10-course dinner designed by the chef using the freshest seasonal ingredients imported directly from Japan. This place has no other menu except Omakase at S$134 ($118 +10% +3%) for dinner and no wine cockage fee. The chef could also tailor to your need if you are sensitive to certain food. We have been dinning here for more than 10 years regularly, and they changed the menu almost monthly. A real great place for authentic, classic and seasonal Japanese food which is value for money. Service is attentive and ambience is zen chic. Definitely a place for those who enjoy an elegant Japanese meal
5
Have been going to Hachi for the past 3 or 4 years, and has always been our favourite Japanese restaurant. However, on our last visit they have taken the Omakase dinner to a different level, 10 out of 10 for presentation and freshness, all the 11 courses were memorable, and some of the best value in town, and a good BYO policy. Highly recommended, don't miss
5
Been there twice. Once for dinner and the recent one for lunch. Love it. Food is fresh and well served. Good presentation and thoughtful preparation. Truly enjoyed the omakase experience. Nice ambience, neat setup. Service is good too. Always make reservation before going down. I will visit again for sure. :

Hachi is run by Watanabe Kishio who serves up his signature omakase meal for SGD 118++ in the evenings. This is great value for money considering the quality of the food. At this price, you can of course not expect every dish to contain premium ingredients but at Hachi you will get a great meal with interesting flavors, The style of the meal is innovative rather than strictly following the protocol of Japanese kaiseki. If you are after the latter, we suggest you go to Goto instead on Ann Siang Road where tradition takes center stage.The strength of Hachi lies in the personal touch of Watanabe-san and the fact that you do not need to pay SGD 200-450++ per person as in some of the townâ€™s premium Japanese restaurants. This makes Hachi accessible beyond major events like wedding anniversaries and bonus celebrations.Overall, Hachi is our favourite up-market Japanese restaurant in Singapore
5
I place this restaurant in the The. Best. Of. Japanese. Hall of Fame. Sit down and the wait staff ask you what don't you eat. The chef, from whatever ingredients he's got for that day, then whips up dish after dish for you, until you say stop! The food is like nothing i've tried before.go to chaaarlotte.livejournal.com for more food detail
