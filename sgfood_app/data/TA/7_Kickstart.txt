This is a quaint coffee shop in the Singapore Art Museum precinct that was recommended by a local. They have many different kinds of coffee and you may have to wait while each is individually brewed.

This cafe has moved around since it opened in 2011 and I have followed it for it's excellent coffee. Ambience is great, if a little bit noisy when the artsy crowd have meetings there!!

They put a pandan leaf in your coffee and it was surprisingly fantastic! I've been doing the same since I've gotten home from vacation, but Singaporean pandan leaf is much more fresh and fragant than the stuff you can get in Canada.

It's an excellent place for food and cold brew coffee. The selection is somewhat limited, but whatever is made is really good.
Try the Cajun chicken and French toast with ice cream and marshmallows!

A nice place to have a cup of java after the museum visit. Friendly staff. Plain tables & chairs. Fair prices. No complaints, but nothing special either.

Unique new latte on menu from time to time, have to try yam version the next visit. Tried salted egg yolk on French Toast and Thai chicken wings, yummy. Lassi is a little disappointed though.

A coffee shop/cafe located in the Singapore Art Museum. I only had a latte that was very good.
But the menu looked good and reasonable, and the food that others were eating looks pretty good.

Not as reviewed this is a uni cafe for coffee drinkers . Sugar donuts and pastry no breakfast. Coffee was nice though. Hard to find ... Not really worth the effort

Tired of the bitter coffee at Starbucks or the high prices at any coffee chain? Then this is a great alternative. Simple place, plastic chairs, great coffee, and at half the price of the chains. Tucked away along the side of the art museum on Waterloo St, it is worth the extra sixty seconds required to find it. Good value for money.

Now this is a coffee / breakfast spot with a real difference! We came here as Fine Palate was closed for the long weekend. As coffee lover, we were looking for a cafe for Saturday brunch & saw the sign for their iced drip coffee's so got curious. I went a short macch which was perfect & the drip Ethiopia Limu served on ice which was brilliant ... very strong, but brilliant. My parter loved her Singapore Butter Latte. Brunch was also creative & great. We shared our 2 dishes of Portobello Mushroom with egg, hash, salad & grilled tomato; plus breakfast burger with scrambled egg omelette, charred bun, garlic aioli & bacon ... with a side of umami fries. This place is a must check out, & owner was saying they just got their liquor licence so they can open later with some beers. Try it today for its coffee & food.

Delicious coffee from a great independent coffee shop. The staff are polite and helpful and there's a wide selection of beans to choose from.

Not much to say. Good ice coffee at Singapore Art Museum. Try it instead of the usual Starbucks. They seem to care

First time trying this place but I will never want to be back. Ordered the mushroom egg Benedict dish for brunch and it came with a mixture of mushrooms (button mushrooms and the japanese straw mushrooms). The mushrooms had a funny, rather sour taste and I suspect that they are not fresh, perhaps spoiled. Left a whole bunch of them on my plate and the waitress didn't even bother to ask for feedback when she was clearing the table. As for my iced chocolate, it was not stirred and blended properly and the chocolate powder was coagulated in the drink - for the same amount I am paying, I would rather stick to my trusty star bucks for better iced cocoa. Other than the cashier, the other Service staff was not fantastic and I don't particularly feel welcomed. A less than cosy place for a Saturday brunch. There are other places for brunch if you are thinking to have one

On the side of the Singapore art museum you'll find some of the best lattes and espressos in Singapore. Really friendly staff. They serve food too but I've only tried the egg wrap. It was definitely tasty. Ditch the Starbucks and go here. You won't regret it.

I love my espresso and am very particular about it. I love the coffee, the way they make their coffee, the amazing options (tiramisu macchiato) and the friendly staff. Defintely a great place to chill and grab a bite after sight seeing at the Singapore Mueseum of Art

We had eggs benedict for their Saturday brunch and coffee with a brownie after. This was great - eggs well cooked and the brownie perfectly warmed. Order at counter but orders arrived quick enough.The experience overall was not ideal with simple things letting it down. The service ranged from the very nice cashier to the awkward and inarticulate waiter and the difficult counter service making a meal out of an extra order of toast (which was on the menu but appeared to perplex them). It seems to be aiming for a trendy and arty theme and the decor is nice and minimal but their attempts at quirky - plastic jugs for drinking water (it just looks unappetising) - and spelling please as 'pleeze' on signs doesn't quite pull it off. The radio blasting out top 20 hits doesn't fit in either. All a bit confused in terms of style and atmosphere

This wonderful cafe is bursting with character, excellent coffee and food, and welcoming and warm service. Run with passion by the owner, Swee, and her dedicated and loyal team, this is the perfect place to enjoy excellent coffee. You'll be back for more once you've tasted the wonderful coffee and experienced the genuinely warm and welcoming service. This cafe is a gem
