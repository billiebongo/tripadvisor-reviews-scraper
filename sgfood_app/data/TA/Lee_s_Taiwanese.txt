We were intrigued by this restaurant for a while, but when we tried it, it didn't disappoint!
The dishes were tasty, and the prices weren't that high.
We've only eaten here during off-peak hours, so the service was pretty quick.

Arrived Singapore in the evening. Found this place with simple food. Lots of choice. Small portion for each dish but good for sharing with friends. Price is cheap.

Staff not attentive, chit-chat among themselves, service is much better at the Jurong branch. Food generally not bad. Need to improve on the beef noodle, tasted like ready-made stock and cannot compare with those in Taiwan.

Visited this restaurant after church as we walked past the restaurant several times without trying.
You can find the usual Taiwanese street food at the restaurant. Servers are helpful. The food are tasty but nothing spectacular.

Nice food, and I always go back for their chicken chop rice when I have the craving for it. The food portion is big, price is reasonable too. The staff are also friendly

A short walk from the top of the escalator coming from Buona Vista MRT, this restaurant is conveniently located. The menu has Taiwan style noodles, rice dishes and snacks. The portion sizes are reasonable but could be bigger. The dumplings and Soya Bean Paste Noodles were yummy. We appreciated the efficient and friendly service even though we walked in ten minutes before last orders were taken. We were seated at an outside table so we could take our time eating after they closed

Had my dinner at the Jurong branch one evening and ordered all the fried stuff. It was really good for a fried food fix and we had our sinfully good pork and chicken cutlets. Had also tried the branch at Buona Vista and loved the value for money buffet

The food is good and very authentic Taiwanese. The bonus was the beers were cheap for Singapore. The fried pumpkin in the buffet was very tasty as was the pork chop I ordered for my main. The taiwanese stewed pork rice was also good. I ate there with a friend who was staying nearby. Very cool place to eat if you are staying in the area and for an evening beer

The menu in this restaurant aremostly favorite Taiwanese street food. Taking our order was fast but delivery of orders took time .We even had to follow up some of our orders. Side dishes and even main dish have small portions.if u have a big appetite , you have to order twice of the same meal.
