Great place surrounded by other Korean restaurants. This place has the usual Korean BBQ as well as Korean drinks. The food here is decent and the price is very reasonable. Definitely worth coming back with a group.

I'm a regular and love this Korean place for its authentic Korean food and atmosphere. Highly recommend the Army stew and liquor cheaper than others.

This is the first time for having dinner to my Sister at this restaurant. It has a nice environment (quite place) to let you communicate with your family and friends. But for our food abit salty and one of our food is a bit burn (the steam egg). Their pricing is quite reasonable compare with other Korean food.

Had a very fun dinner at Supulae with officemates. Great food with tasty and succulent barbeque of beef and pork. Those were supplemented with side dishes of steamed egg custard, kimchi and various other appetizers. You need to pair them with Korean Hite beer and Jinro soju - the colder, the better. Ambience is casual, perfect for after work get-togethers. Though the place is quite small, it works to its advantage of providing good value food and drinks in an informal setting. Quick service added value to our dining experience. Will come back soon.

We were staying in the area and as fans of Korean food, this street caught our eye as there are a number of Korean restaurants as you walk along. We chose Supalae as we particularly like this bbq style where the food is cooked on the grill in the middle of your table and the waiter cuts it into smaller pieces for you. From the different options we chose a $48 set for 2 and this was more than adequate. Service was fast and attentive and a reasonable set of the standard side dishes was served. Add in a couple of beers and overall it was good value for money, especially at Singapore prices

Went for dinner with my family of 4 and we ordered the 2 pax meal @48 bucks and topped up with some meat too. The beef was marinated nicely by the server, and the bbq plate was changed regularly too. We ordered the sirloin steak and the staff helped us to cook it medium rare. Unfortunately, the steak was surprisingly tough and and we decided to let the manager know. She was very understanding and gave us a full refund for it. Thumbs up for the service! Anyway I would really recommend going for the buffet per pax instead as we found that the set meals didn't offer enough meat haha.

We'd walked past Supulae (Korean Barbeque) and were intrigued by the dangling copper-colored fire hoses/elephant trunks /vacuum cleaners, but actually ventilator tubes over every table. People seemed to be having a good time inside under what we termed their "vacuum cleaners" and we did too this evening. We got one of the packages, the "chicken and pork." And on came a stunning variety of very tasty foods, the grilled meat, of course, rice, beans, kimchee, eggplant (?), egg custard, onions, lettuce, sauces, bean paste soup (quite good), and other items I can't recall. The meat was excellent, excepting the highly forgettable chicken sausage (think grocery store hot dog). We'd ordered a vegetable omelet, quite good, with enough left over to box up for lunch. The ventilating hoses/trunks/vents work marvelously so that even with the on-table cooking you aren't any warmer than at any other Singaporean restaurant. Supulae is young person's place, noisy, slightly funky look, definitely casual, but not raucous. You can hear each other talk but it's not for intimate/romantic evenings. Some groups finished eating and then took drinks out to the sidewalk tables. A lot of good food for the price ($48 for two). Reasonable beer selection. The food came quickly. Getting the check took a bit more time, but you could see the staff was working hard and staying pleasant to everyone. It's a fun place
