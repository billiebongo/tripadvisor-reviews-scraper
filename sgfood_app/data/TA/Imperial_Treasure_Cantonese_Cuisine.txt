Experiencing a company ‘Lo Hei’ lunch (Chinese new year celebration meal) was a great way to sample of a lot of dishes in one sitting (eight to be precise). We started with a roast duck dish which had a crispy skin and a lovely juicy texture to the meat. That was swiftly followed by a steamed fish lightly cooked in soy sauce. Next was a long bean and stir fry dish that was also tasty in a delicate way and not too strong. The next dish I skipped as it was a shark’s fun soup, so it was a little disappointing personally to hear they served that, but as many people still order the dish at this festive time, it’s something that still appears on the menu. I’m not sure if my appetite was spoiled after that but the following dishes felt a bit underwhelming. They included a vegetable and sea cucumber dish in a heavy sauce that seemed to smother the flavour. The carbs came in the form of glutinous rice which also seemed heavy and overly oily. The desert was a red bean soup that tasted a little bland and was unfortunately a downer for the end of the meal. Overall the meal was nice without being great and the service was similarly efficient without being memorable. Hopefully they can ditch the shark’s fin from the menu and I would be inclined to return, otherwise I’ll keep my distance.

Had dinner with buddies and the menu was specially arranged for us. Roast suckling pig to start, followed by Sea Whelk soup, abalone with fish maw, lobster noodles and almond tofu for dessert.All the dishes were very well executed and we had a thoroughly enjoyable meal
2
Table not ready when we arrived (20 Min after the schedule ) We order Peking duck : not genuine and not cooked enough . Peking duck was charged 88 sgd ++ but restaurant charge additional 10 sgd to cook a 2nd way which doesn t look to me a standard practice knowing we wanted the meat being inside the pancake on the first serve . Also no feedback form available

Really good food, but the service was a little disjointed when we went for dinner, perhaps because we were in a private room or the place was crowded. But they forgot two dishes that we ordered, and the meal was extended by 30 minutes while we waited for those dishes.We ordered two sea cucumbers, two pork rib soups. One sichuan soup, garoupa with ham, chinese fillet stek, beancurd with mushroom and chicken liver - all the dishes were cooked beautifully, delicious and well presented.For dessert, we had alovera apple jelly, sago cream with mango, red bean cream and dumplings in syrup.The service, other than the manager who missed our initial orders, was good.The meal for six people came up to $320
3
We had dinner and tried Assorted Vegetables in Oyster sauce, Sweet and Sour Pork, Crispy Spiced beancurd, Salted fish fried rice all in the Cantonese style. Service was friendly and efficient

The service from the waiting staff at this Cantonese food restaurant is really prompt and attentive. Was actually looking for a quick simple dinner but ended up ordering a serving of roast pork for starter, frog legs done in two styles, braised bean curd, stir-fried greens and the soup of the day. The roast pork came a little cold and as such, the skin lack the crispiness as similar servings from competing restaurants. Taste-wise, the vegetable dish is ordinary, the braised bean curd is excessively rich, while the frog legs are actually disappointing. The star of the dinner was surprisingly, the soup of the day. The carrot and pork soup was simply superbly done and wonderfully tasty. It must have been left simmering on low heat for a long time. The lady commented that the last time she visit, the soup was just as good, and we agreed that the next time we visit, we would only order the soup of the day! Price-wise, I would consider it as expensive considering the quality of food

As always, the food is delicious. The staff over at this new fine dining outlet at Tanjong Pagar Centre are attentive. Towels, speciality tea, tit bits were all served timely. Ultimately the chef is as good as Orchard Ion, some dishes even better, like the smoked eel - simply exquisite & fish maw with chestnut, are so skillfully prepared. The sommelier manager - Jordi is a wonderful personality & dynamic, that makes you feel totally welcomed & relaxed. This outlet has more privacy & the ambience suits us fine

Had a very decent Cantonese dinner. Had been to restaurant for dim sum which was equally delicious. This restaurant is very popular esp during dinner time, so pls make reservations to skip the walk-in queue
5
This branch has been here for years and it's hard to get a booking during lunch sometimes. The dim sum is simply the best in Singapore in my opinion. Other food are excellent. Try the truffle oil noodle or XO carrot cake. Roast meats and steam fish are always consistent and top notch. You can't go wrong here.

Our Boss gave us a trip here during lunch, the Great World City Outlet. It has a differing and rather stellar shopfront; large fish tanks first and as one walks inward it is the wine cellar that attracts attention. Setting the tone for a well-healed meal in this fine Cantonese restaurant with all its wood paneling…. Ordering here hardly follows the Menu as diners sort out advice from the ordering managers, though it definitely offers a comprehensive selection of Cantonese dishes. Not too pushy and balanced in terms of food recommendations. We had soup of the day, meat braised Noodle and assortment of dim sum which includes steamed prawn dumpling (ha kau siew mai), steamed pork rib, yam puff and steamed rice roll. The food came after a short 15 mins wait, and they practiced individual serving so there’s no clashing of chopsticks over common dishes, and more hygiene too!. They were carefully to remove the duck meat and vegetables from the soup so that we get to drink and savour the dense soup well.. All the dim sum items come in 3 and were pretty fresh and taste all very well balanced. Especially like the steamed beef ball with vegetable which is packed with steamed moist meat. The prawn in the ha kau are fresh & succulent too, tender with a slight chew. It is in a room-setting for the 6 of us but we were service wise is okay, they are attentive and responded well. Topping up chrysanthemum tea before the cup only half empty and clearing plates on time, but only to be expected of a high-end restaurant…It was conversation that was the indulgence and we were so full that we skipped dessert altogether. Food wise hardly any complaint (flaw) but the pricing is definitely on the high sid

I have been here many times and I must say that this is the best chinese restaurant in Singapore. All my chinese friends go here and although not cheap is certainly for value and quality the best!
4
Understand that this restaurant recognize and receive 2 star Michelin award. Food is nice and also serve dim sum in the afternoon.
2
I might have come on the same day as the other guy because the service was atrocious. Worse service i had during my tripFood was good but poor service means its really hard to recommend this place. Probably many other dim sum places that will have similar food but better servic

It's no wonder that this branch of Imperial Treasure is poorly rated, while the food is of comparable standard to the other Cantonese cuisine branch, the service here is absolutely appalling. Restaurant was maybe 75% occupied during lunch time but the wait staff seemed very inpatient throughout. - Had to ask multiple times before sauces were provided. - Was told that 3rd plate of shrimp chilli was chargeable (Never told this at Airport branch; maybe its a new rule - not indicated anywhere on the menu)- ?Manager guy (only man wearing a blazer) was unnecessarily rude -- I informed him i had the imperial treasure club and he asked me what was my number; It was the first time i had used the card so i checked my phone to see what number he was talking about , 'NO WHAT IC DID YOU SIGN UP WITH' ... ok . Maybe phrase your question better if you don't want your precious time wasted- Another source of frustration - for the imperial treasure club - sign up indicates that 2x$50 welcome vouchers are included, but no where is it mentioned that both vouchers could not be used at one go. they just charged Bill - $50 to my card and told me to use the $50 another time. - Worse service i have experienced for some time in Singapore Well. I definitely won't use the other $50 here. Food at the Changi T3 one is comparable, and the service is exponentially better. Avoid at all cost
4
My go-to place for chinese food whenever i'm in the area. I usually order our family favourites - roast meat sampler, silken tofu, truffle noodles. All tasty . The service is fine, i don't know why other reviewers face so much heartacheJust don't order any seafood swimming in the tanks that has no or "seasonal" price im the menu, unless you're loaded.
4
Service staff were friendly and attentive. Food served was hot and service is pretty efficient dispite the crowd. Ideal place for business luncheon. Good range of tim sum and ala carte selection. Do check out their daily soup as well. They have various outlet across Singapore so you might want to check out the outlet for your convenience

My family and I enjoyed a lovely lunch here today - the dim sums were all very fresh and taste all very well balanced. We also ordered the beef egg Hor Fun which had the right amount of "wok hey". For desserts we tried the custard paus with loads of egg custards oozing out and equally delicious were the almond cream and red bean soup. Haven't been back for a while but after today will definitely return
1
We arrived while the restaurant was not busy for dinner and had to wait for over one hour to get our first course which was a small soup. There was no apologies offered for this and the manager, Mr. Leslie was extremely rude in dealing with the situation. Definitely not recommended if you are looking for a good dining experience in Singapore. Pity as I have had other great meals at the Imperial Treasure chain. Also they had a dead Crab in their tank which didn't make for an appetizing arrival
5
Went for lunch with a friend who wanted to introduce me to Cantonese food. Everything that we had - dimsum, chicken, fish stick fry, shrimp - was very tasty. Staff was very attentive in service topping up chrysanthemum tea before the cup was even half empty and clearing plates on time. Price was less than I had expected of similar restaurants. Overall, a pleasant experience
4
This is the place to be for good Cantonese cuisine, you will not be disappointed! While the Cantonese dishes are available all day, its Hong Kong dim sum is available for lunch only. During weekends, this is also available for brunch from 10.30am. Besides a wide selection of dim sum, there are many kinds of congee to choose from. The beef brisket and roast duck noodles are really worth a try too
3
The food here is average, not as good as the Peking Duck places...
I don't understand why they differentiate their restaurants with some many names but the cooking/taste of food does not varies so much.
4
A quieter corner for lunch. Great food, good service though the decor is slightly dated. Food was generally of high quality.
5
A good Cantonese cuisine. Owner Albert brought the restaurant in sometimes in 2007. I think so. Selection quite limited and price slightly above average
4
Went down to Imperial Treasure with my family, nice dim sum and friendly service staff. One of my favourite place for dim sum.
2
My husband and I went there today for lunch. After we finished eating the main courses, we were kept waiting for more than 30 minutes for our dessert. We asked the waitress to check for us several times and she always came back and told us that it would be ready soon. When we complained to the hall manager about this, all he said was "Do you want to cancel it?" We did cancel the dessert and was very disappointed about their poor service and attitude
4
We came to Imperial Treasure for a Dim Sum lunch. I missed the traditional trolleys being pushed around. Instead we had to order on a piece of paper. So it was a bit difficult to estimate how much we would consume. We had a small place of roast meat - and it was a very small plate. All the steamed items we ordered were very good and the plate of noodles we shared was equally good.Prices were a bit steep
4
We ordered the set dinner for 2 at $98++ but value wasn't great. Started with a small serving of roast duck and pork, then a tasty soup, next came (2) pieces of shrimp in snow peas, a piece of fried cod each, noodles and red bean dessert. Kind of like a Chinese wedding dinner shrunk for 2. Cooking was acceptable, but not at that price. A bit disappointed.
4
One of the best Siew Yoke - a little pricey but worth the occasional splurge. The fried sesame dough ball is crispy and tasty, a rare find nowadays. Very generous with ingredients in their century egg porridge - yummy! Overall quality of dim sum is good. Special mention of how they take initiative to serve u the savoury items before the sweet ones even though u order them all at once on the order sheet. Double thumbs up for the extra effort!
4
This place is very packed on sunday afternoon, i usually book it a few days before in order to get a table for my family.The service staffs are very busy but generally still attentive. Surrounding can be a little cramp and noisy at main hall area. So I always like to ask for room.The dim sums are nicely done. Shrimps are fresh and fried dim sums are crispy. There is not much to complain about. There is a long list of varieties of dim sums to suit each and every member of your family. I recommend the normal dimsum classic like har gao, xiao long bao, beancurd roll and chicken feet. For those more funky dishes, it would be more subjective. I prefer the classics and stick to it.Dont miss out their pig liver porridge. it is extra-ordinary
5
We were invited by a close friend to this restaurant. Suffice to say that it is quintessentially Cantonese with many classic dishes and the yum cha fare. The restaurant is beautifully appointed with the waiters and waitresses in classic Mao outfits. Unlike some Cantonese restaurants, the staff seemed very well trained and courteous, attending to our every need. They were particularly useful with small children who were finicky eaters, suggesting alterations to certain dishes. The roast pork belly was the best I'd ever tasted. Crispy crackling yet soft and buttery meat. The yum cha fare was predictable but very tasty. We left very happily
4
If you are searching for Yum Cha with some style and Pizzaz, then this is the go. They also have some small private dining rooms for that intimate occassion.
3
Nothing really special other than a well cooked cantonese meal. I would say it is indeed a good value for money restaurant.
1
In transit stopped here to meet an acquaintance only to be horrified to find an entire page of shark fin soups...
4
If you wanted to dine privately rather than in the usual way in an open plan Chinese restaurant, this place offers small to large private dining rooms. Food and service is good but not exceptional.
4
Have been there many times, so far the standard for dim sum have been consistent and not failed so far. If small group ask for sofa seats where you get more privacyIf weekends better to reserve a table as it can get crowded The daily soup is also good and worth trying I also tried the roast duck w noodles in soup, something that is very popular in HK.

Actually, I went to the Raffles City Shopping Centre Branch but there was not link to that Branch.Extremely RUDE staff and BAD service. We made a reservation the day before for 12:00 noon and reached the restaurant earlier at 11:30am. We are not unreasonable people and we waited patiently for 30 minutes until 12pm. In this 30 minutes, the restaurant manager entertained several groups of customers that had the same number of people as us. These groups were all with queue numbers and did not make any reservations. We asked if he could serve us first and if we need to get the queue number instead, but he said no because we have a reservation at 12pm. Only after waiting until 12pm and after several groups with queue numbers had gone into the restaurant, did he ask us to go in. I asked him politely for an explanation and his reason was because he wanted to get us a sofa seat. But from my observation, clearly the groups before us with queue numbers were also given sofa seats.To be honest, is this even logical and does this even make sense??? I politely asked the manager if it is ok if i get a queue number and join the queue instead of waiting for the reservation at 12 because it seems to be faster that way but he insisted to keep me waiting. I understand that the F&B environment can be very demanding and stressful but please also kindly attend to the queries of your customers. We are not that demanding. We just hope the people who serve us can have a bit more common sense and handle things logically.I'm deeply disappointed in the services that were provided to me at this particular outlet. After reading the reviews in the other outlets for the Imperial Treasure Group, I'm adamant that such simple service in-competencies did not happpen to only me alone. I'm quite disappointed as I thought the food at Imperial Treasure was good but I don't think I will patronize your outlets again if this sort of service continues

We decided to have our dinner @ this place bcos we had a good service and nice food at another branch JEM. Unfortunately we are not happy with the service we received today. There is a waiter name Leslie Tha have mock us when we are ordering. When we are asking whether there is sauce for a particular dish bcos we need to put some sauce together with rice to our daughter, but then he laugh with an impatient attitude saying that it is common for a cantonese dish not have extra sauce. Are we expect to know that before we come in? And after ordering, he just throw the order receipt on our table and walk away. What kind of attitude is this? This is a quite high end restaurant, are we supposed to get a service like that ? No standard and very impolite service. Such a unpleasant experience
1
Today, we had a brunch in this branch for a dim sum. We were totally disappointed by the food. Oily, salty and not refine at all... The worst is I found a piece of plastic inside my steam beef balls, unconsciously we started to have a doubt about the cleanness of the food in this restaurant. My baby was eating the congee, I was about to stop him. Maybe it is exceptional... But still. They just told me sorry and said that they were going to refund me (seriously???). I said you could more for this kind of incidence even more for a name as Imperial...We used to live in Hk, we used to taste average, good and refine but this one was really disappointed. Finally, we have them a chance to continue our brunch. And it is really a nice Cantonese food. Under average I will say... Aujourd'hui, nous avons "brunche dans cette chaîne et nous avions été vraiment déçus! Surtout quand je trouve un morceau de plastique dans mon la farce de mon dim sum au bœuf, il y a de quoi se poser des questions! Ils voulaient juste me rembourser ce plat... (Sans blague???) Je déconseille fortement et surtout à Singapore il ne fait chercher de la bonne cuisine chinoise raffinée car ce n'est pas le bon pays. Dim sum c'est Hk ou Taipei!
3
Came here for an early CNY dinner and ordered various dishes for a group of 11 adults and 2 children. Peking duck was ok but not great (not quite crispy enough). Noodles too oily. Other dishes all fairly standard with nothing particularly impressive. Only real reason to come here is if you happen to live in the area
2
I have heard many good things about imperial treasure so was excited to try it. Went on a Sunday afternoon at 1 pm and was told that they are completely full and I can get a table by 2.15 pm. Was craving dimsums and the place looked really busy so decided to wait. At 2.15, when i asked the hostess she said my table would take some more time. At this point there were about 5-6 groups waiting for a table so I took a seat and continued to wait. Over the next 20 mins, she proceeded to call all the groups until finally I was the only person waiting. I saw the next group of people leave the restaurant so I waited for her to call out my name but she didn't. On asking her, she said the place was full and I was the 2.15 waiting list (whatever that meant). After waiting for 5 more minutes, I asked her again (2 more groups had left the place by then) and she repeated the same thing and I had to wait. Finally, at about 2.50, I walked in on my own and asked the server if there was a table and was immediately led to an empty table to be seated. When I walked in, I was shocked to see 2-3 empty tables and while they were larger tables (seating 4-5 people) and while I was alone, there were many 4-5 seat tables occupied by couples/2 people in the restaurant. I ordered three dimsums - pork char siew, prawn har gau and the diced mushroom dim sum. The char siew and har gau were really good but the mushroom in the mushroom dimsum was overpowered by big pcs of capsicum in the dim sum. I ordered the bill, which they made a mistake on and overcharged me and then took another 5 minutes to give me a copy of the revised bill.While the food was good, the service was so bad that I doubt I will be returning
4
highly recommended for dim sum. All the favourites, served in a pleasant and comfortable environment. No complaints
4
A family celebration took us to the restaurant. The staff were polite, professional and clearly knew the dish sizes we needed to order. Restaurant was comfortable & conveniently nestled inside Great World City. Food was very enjoyable good! Great steamed Soon Hock fish. All happy!
5
What I Liked:
Legendary Chinese food, with great staff attending to your every need.
This place never seems to disappoint me, everytime!
What I Disliked:
Nothing.
Yes or No? Yes because Imperial Treasure sets the culinary bar very high.
5
Excellent Dim Sum here; fresh, piping hot, fast efficient service. The food here is always delicious. Bookings / reservations a must, especially on weekends or count on a long wait to get in.
4
Were there for a birthday celebration this July. We were seated in the common dining area.The food were good except the portion (especially the roasted chicken) seems pretty small.Staff when busy did not really have the time to recommend their speciality when we requested.But the ambience and decor is nice.May come back another time
4
For non-Chinese, the restaurant can be quite intimidating if you are not very familiar with Chinese food. However, the friendly staff here can advise you on what you want. Try the dim sums, particularly an unusual wrapped bun with rice crackers inside. Really great stuff here if you like Cantonese cuisine
5
We have walked passed that restaurant many many times - it has never for some reason tempted us to try it. Today however, we tried. And we are glad we did. When trying out new chinese restaurant, we are pretty standard in our try-out-dishes; Lemon chicken, sweet&sour prork, garlic broccoli, fried rice and pepper beef. All of them perfect!Will for sure be back and try more dishes!Service was also very good. One of the waiters looked not-to-happy, but our main one was very nice, helpful and polite
3
had lunch on 5th May 2013. ordered dim sum and some dishes, they were all average. Their standard has dropped alot since our last visit. the 'char siew so' was not as good as Lei Garden's which we had on 1st May 2013. Some service staff was rude. About 15 mins after ordering the food, we wanted to inform them not to serve all the dishes at the same time, we caught hold of a serving staff who in turn told a captain about it. We overheard the captain 'who wears false lashes' telling her: " Why can't they wait? Everyone has to wait!" All these said in a very rude manner. She obviously has mistaken what we wanted but even so, she shouldn't have said such a thing. We wanted to confront her but we did not so as we do not wish to make a scene. The rest of the wait sfuff were quite polite. Whatever it is we are not going back again as the food is really so average. The staff at Lei garden were very polite which they did received a token of appreciation from us. Must order the Char Siew So & soup from Lei Gardens Chijmes

Went to this restaurant with my family and this is my first time there. Got a reservation for 1030 session, got there and ordered at 1040am. There were only few tables there then, first dish came, waited for almost 20 minutes for the following dim sum to be served. They gave us a pot of tea and just leave it there, there is no one to pour for us during the first round. During that time, I asked one of the waitress and she told me "it's coming, it's coming" she talk to me as she walk away. So we waited for another 10 mins, I asked another waitress who got no expression on her face" could you mind checking our order as we waited for quite sometime" guess what, the waitress did not reply me or say anything and just walked away. What kind of service is this? I didn't know that this restaurant employ someone who can't reply to my simple question. At least she should say "ok" but she just walk away like nothing happen. I understand maybe they are short handed but this no way to treat a customer like this. They are in the service orientated industry and no one will feel to be treated in that manner. The food was ok but frankly speaking, I been to many restaurant for dim sum, this is the restaurant that I will never want to go back again and trust me, by paying 10% to these waitress there, it's just like dumping your money into the drain. For goodness sake, please go train your waitress to give abit of respect to the consumer and if not at least ask them to smile, I don't owe them a living

Went for a belated CNY dinner. Six adults, four kids including two babies. Came early as they have two seatings. The food was outstanding in the sense that they have moved with the times and created modern versions of classics, e.g. serving crab meat with truffle oil rather than vinegar, an excellent idea.happy to come back over and over again
4
Nice food & ambience. Great place for a business lunch as it is not so noisy as compared to city crowd.
However, they messed up my reservations. When my guests arrived at the restaurant, they were told that no reservations was made.
4
Great food and quality. Charges is reasonable with good selection.
4
The food is delicious and the service staff are attentive. Prices of food tend to be on a high side but its worth it.
5
Sophisticated Yum Cha with BEST Pork Belly we've ever eaten. Every dish was superb.
4
Opened to rival the crystal jade chain, imperial treasure somehow gives off a more ernest and quality vibe. We ordered their dim sum which included the carrot cake, BBQ pork pastry, chicken feet, xiao long bao and i feel that the taste is not inferior to crystal jade, and without the gimmicks that the latter resorts to, like pastry in panda/mouse shapes but tastes awful. We ordered several entrees as well like the japanese tofu, silver fish and roasted platter of duck, pork and they were all quite good. We also had the noodles with truffle oil and the truffle oil was generous! you can smell it wafting in the air as the plate was brought to the table. The fried rice with crab meat was also good. Service was ok and acceptable for a medium to high end chinese restaurant as this. All in all, a good, reliable restauran
2
Considering the quality of Chinese food you can get at hawker centers in Singapore for mere pennies, the food here is as terrible as it is a bad value. You're easily looking at over $100 per person after they add the 17%++ scam if you want to have a nice meal. We left after three beers and three appetizers because only one of the three things was edible. Our bill was $69. I don't have anything positive to say about this restaurant other than that the decor was nice for a restaurant inside a shopping mall.
1
We have been going to Imperial Treasure for over 4 years and have always found the food to be of an extremely high standard. However, the last 2 times we have been there, the service has gone from being good to absolutely terrible. First of all they 'lost' our reservation, dispite having confirmed it by phone the previous day. Once there, we tried to order. The waitress did not speak any english, so it was a bit tricky. After we had ordered we were told by another waiter that they did not have any goose (a speciality of the restaurant). We said ok, we will order some duck instead, but they did not have any duck. We then tried to order some beef - no beef. Then we tried to order some prawns - no prawns. When we asked what was available, we were told chicken and garoupa. When the restaurant charges $$$, just to have chicken and garoupa is not ideal. No apologies were made, so we left. We will not be going back there
4
Imperial Treasure has always been my family's restaurant choice - us being Cantonese from Hong Kong and all that. However, though tasty, it lacks the "X" factor which makes this a great Cantonese restaurant. Service was good but lacked the finer points like filling up your tea & providing extra condiments when needed. The staff tends to be too abrupt in their service approach which does not garner well when guests are prepared to fork out those extra bucks for better service. Note: extra bucks come in multiple forms - the mandatory 10% service charge, the extra $3 for peanuts, and the $2 per head for tea. Add all that up and you're easily looking at a 20+% hefty mandatory tip. Food is good but please don't nickel & dime your customers with this ploy
5
Partly a business evening and partly a celebration with my local business partner in Singapore the one thing I recall is that the table service was just impeccable in all aspects; timely, clean, precise, helpful, not in your face. Then moving onto the food selection; well the two separate menus have an enormous amount of Cantonese delights to choose from and some guidance is available if required from the staff. Certainly would go again
5
For a Westerner the first impression of the restaurant was a bit severe and uninviting but at the end of the evening we were certain to be frequent visitors. We ordered soup to start- hot and sour and a soup with small pieces of melon, for our main dishes we shared a scallop dish , a noodle dish and a prawn dish- all very good quality and quantity. All staff members were very attentive and helpful.The restaurant has booths and round tables with enough room between tables for quiet conversation
4
I ahd lunch on 10th of Sept at the Great World City... food was excellent, the suckling pig, the roasted duck, crab roe... i would recommend this place for great cantonese cuisine...Godo dessert too
4
Bebek Panggang, Congee, dan Lychee Sweet and Sour Pork...ini mah my favourite!
3
Prett decent - almost on par with Crystal jade
4
Most dishes are well executed. But waitress was a little pushy for the expensive stuff.
4
Authentic cantonese
3
Dim Sum was so-so. Still cannot match Crystal Jade Palace. But their Li-Tang (Soup of Day) was good though. And they served coffee!
3
Nice food, good ambiance.
4
Unique way of cooking foie gras with wolfberry and shark's fin. Like their roasted meat.
3
Good service and tasty dim sum esp the xiao long bao.
3
Was there for my mother-in-law's birthday dinner.First, I think that the restaurant is trying to squeeze too many seats into the relatively small restaurant. It was full house and we were very close to the next table. Not very cozy or private, feels like a food court as there is hardly any walking space around the inside of the restaurant.The Peking duck is not fantastic, just taste like normal roast duck. Ordered the tofu with spinach and find it to be 煮炒 standard. The live prawns are nice, but really it's the fact that it's "live"... The sauce is too salty. The sotong with salted eggs is average. Tried that at some coffee shop before. Price is about s$50-s$60 per person. Not very cheap as I believe that can get the same taste at coffee shops, though I know we are paying for the atmosphere and surrounding too... But nothing to shout about that as well..
4
nice noodles and soups. truly a formidable rival to crystal jade's monopoly of noodles and soups.
3
Of all the Imperials...will only go to this.
5
Good!
4
very tasty chinese dishes esp roasted meat, soup!
4
Very good food from a dizzyingly extensive menu. Service is good for a busy and bustling Chinese restaurant.
5
Very Good! Quick Service, good food.
3
Competing with Crystal Jade opposite, it holds its own.
4
Cheap and Delicious. Booking recommended due to lack of seats
5
Always consistently good. The Dim Sum is yummy .... Fave branch is Great World City.
4
My favourite cantonese cuisine place. good service.
