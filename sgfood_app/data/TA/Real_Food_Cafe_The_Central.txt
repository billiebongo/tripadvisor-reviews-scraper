On the B1 level, so take elevator not to miss it. The food is tasty and moreover very healthy. So enjoy it.

its so great to know that there is finally some decent veg in the shopping belt. Really a perfect spot to replenish and recharge. Excellent variety and yummy too. Only dont expect much service, seems they can't be bothered either. FYI

This is for their South Beach branch. Went here with great expectations. Left the place with even less.The food was healthy and tasty. Every menu item had the word "organic" in it. Almost to the point of overkill.The ambience was more than ok. Nice clean lines, comfy and cozy and bright, to echo the menu and convey a sense of expensive wholesome wellness.But it was the service that earns the one star for me. It was as if the servers didn't want you anywhere near their place. As if it was your privilege to even *look* at their restaurant. Maybe customer service is a value added service that you have to order, in a hidden menu? Maybe they were having an off-day? Maybe there was some behind the scenes drama that was going in right before we went in, as we were ordering, all throughout our meal, and even as we ended it? Don't know. All I know is that it rendered the entire experience tasteless and bland.But because of the ingredients list, it was one of the most satisfying meals (in terms of my stomach reaction) I have had in a long time. I will eat these foods again, just not at this restaurant

Friends took me here in a recent trip to Singapore. As a vegan, I loved the choices and broad selection. I chose a salad that you included a chickpea patty, which tasted great and healthy.One of my favourite places and I would sure visit again
2
Went with my wife. Food was good but small portions for the price. Service on the other hand was particularly bad. Had to chase staff for ordering and asked for some water several times to no avail. People around us were also frustrated and having no better luck. Big shame. Won’t be back

This pleasant place in a small mall off Clarke Quie has very tasty food, many dishes and drinks that form a satisfing meal.We set at a big communal table - but there are small tables for single or couples of costumers. We saw around many tables with single costumers sitting alone and enjoying their food - both men and women and felt nice about it.The venue is quite, no music - which is much appreciated because you can chat quitely and concentrate on eating. The cafe has a Japanese atmosfere - something clean, tidy and Zen. They have journals and books for browsing - not for sale - which is also very nice - and a tiny shop with organic vagetables, pasta and other vegan or organic food items.We were 3 and orderred a few drinks and dishes - all were very tasty and served in nice plates.This is our most beloved cafe in Singapore, which we visit year after year and always happy to eat there

On a recent 7 day trip to Singapore we found it fairly easy to find tasty vegan food of various varieties with just the usual amount of scanning online and print menus. However, we were absolutely delighted when we finally tried Real Food Café on Orchard Rd. We ending up eating most of our meals there for the remaining 2 days of our trip once we had found them. Absolutely delicious vegan pancakes for breakfast, cakes that taste like cakes (not like a bland alternative that is sometimes provided as a vegan treat) and delicious main meals. I am already missing their vegan dumplings & noodles.The service was not quick but we weren't after a fast food experience. They could maybe organize things so that their servers don't spend a lot of their time at the counter with their backs to the patrons. Not a great look when we wanted to catch their eye so we could get some service. However, that very slight blip was not enough to detract from the delicious food - and they were very friendly and efficient when they did serve
5
I genuinely don't understand why this is a 4/5. The food here is delicious, I'm not veggie/vegan but my boyfriend and my sister both are. I would highly recommend the sweet potato pancakes (better than the pumpkin ones in my opinion - which are also great) and the marinara pizza! SO full of flavour, really good price and decent portion size too! I see someone gave 3/5 for service, you literally go in and order at the till and they bring your food over - who cares if they're not your best mate by the end of the meal - you go there for the food. Nice chilled café - love it for breakfast, lunch or dinner
3
Vegetarian food here is still tasty, light and reasonably priced. But service staff still look sullen, as if we're intruding into their space. This has been going on for a few years now but the restaurant's still around, so I guess food and prices trump service.
3
I was introduced to the place by a friend.The menu looked really good. The place being vegan and organic friendly.I ordered the iced tea selection but they were sold out! It was only about 2.45pm. Kind of got me on my nerves then. Had to settle for a hot tea - white rose by the pot. It was nice. Served in a pot and a tiny tea cup. Very quiant.I also ordered banana pancake served in fruit sauce. The fruit sauce could be more. It was only a thin layer at the bottom of the plate. The pancake itself tasted and smelled more eggy.. i guess it could also be the reason why the pancakes looked more like omelette (haphazard round and texture) as compared to the typical pancakes we see.My friend asked for plain water to also be served but it was not till the end of our meal which was near to 2 hours later. We had to ask for it again.We were also not given napkins when our orders arrived. We had to ask for it towards the end of our meal
3
The servers at real food need some help. Maybe the owners can double down and get an extra hand or 2 to help out? Or the owners can come in and assist. They are never present, so I assume they just turned and burned.
5
We searched for the internet and found here. They offered a variety food, including Chinese and Asian-ish style of dishes. On the first day of arrival, we tasted cakes and sweets which were wonderful. These sweets were a bit expensive but worth trying it. The prices of the dishes were appropriate and one dish could share with two women. The bowls of soup like pumpkin and tom yam were so lovely and we want to have them again in the future. The restaurant has a small shop where we can buy some organic food. During my stay in SG, I bought a bottle of home-made enzyme syrup made from Mango and Apple, which was so tasty. I really love the place and frequently went there. A child-fridnely place too
3
I was really looking forward to visiting this place having heard very good things. I am huge fan of eating clean and healthy and liked their philosophy. Food arrived quickly and staff were lovely. The place itself was very clean and tidy. But serving sizes are teeny tiny (child size). I had the portobello burger plus the sides of potato wedges and salad plus a raw food cake for dessert, it was all lovely but too small. I left hungry
4
We are regular costumers of Real Food, one of the best vegetarian restaurants one can get in Singapore. Like all their branches, the food is not only extremely tasty and fresh, but also extremely healthy - with beans, tomatoes, herbs etc. added carefully to each dish. Both my children, 6 and 15, love it immensely despite not liking to eat vegetables much! There's even a small area for you to buy organic & healthy food as well. If not for the slow service and inattentiveness of the staff at the Real Food Orchard Central branch, I would have given this 5 stars. We waited to be seated, outside the restaurant for the longest time possible, yet there was no response and we just went in to take a seat. My daughter went to get the menus herself for our family and we waited for an exceeding long time with our hands raised to grab the attention of the staff to order our food. Service was not personal and rather rushed and business-like, but I believe this was because of the crowds as we came here on a public holiday. Overall, there is good food here and service is always something rather subjective to each individual. Really recommend this place!
5
So so so yum! I am a known health freak but want to enjoy the flavours that Singapore has to offer and this cafe allow d me to do both! Made from wholefoods and real ingredients with no preservatives or colours ! So tasty and so many options! I had the curry noodles! YU
4
Real food is a great option if you want a meal that is healthy yet not overpriced! The food is made from good quality ingredients and is delicious. The only thing is that the service and the waiting time can be rather slow, but the food makes it worth the wait! The cafe has long tables for big groups as well as smaller ones so its pretty easy to get a tabl
3
I've been eating at Real Food since they started business. Being a loyal and very frequent customer it has been with disappointment that I have experienced the diminishing portion sizes, most notably in the lentil soup. I love the place and even have gotten to know staff, so I really wish they can keep the same ideals and principles on which they were founded and not succumb to the green meany - greed via cost cutting.
5
We were spoilt for choice with all the vegan options available! After a long flight from the UK this was a perfect meal to boost our energy! Full of flavours and perfect combination of veg. Only downfall was the sides that came with the burgers were very small in portion. Other than that, great place to eat and service was top
4
The atmosphere here is great. You feel very relax and the restaurant is not crowded or even empty during lunch hours. You will have to wait around 20 mins for your food to be served.Food looks great and nice too. Just abit oily for the omelette.Great to have a conversation here as the restaurant is quiet and not noisy.
5
This place was exactly what we needed to rejuvenate after 10-hrs of walking. You feel your body from the inside with the delicious, wholesome and fresh menu options. There's something for everyone, and it doesn't even stand out there are no meat items!!! Soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, pizza - you name it! The hand pressed fresh juices are also something to behold! Can't wait to go back!!
4
We found this little cafe by accident at The Central off Clark Quay . It was a pleasant change to have a very healthy organic vegetarian breakfast / brunch
I had the chickpea salad , very refreshing
5
Excellent food, had the pesto pasta which is out of this world. Lentil soup full of ginger was terrific. Quinoa burger was fresh though a bit bland. Salad leaves fresh.
4
The most reasonably priced and delicious organic food we've ever eaten. Beet Burger and Portabello Mushroom Burger full of flavour and ample serving with organic potato wedges and salad. Just off Orchard Rd and away from all the noise....we will return!
5
We are vegetarians and struggle to get a decent meal at most restaurants even in this day and age. There are never really many options for vegetarians. So Real food was like a boon. They have so many options and we were a group of 6 and we tried 6 dishes. Boy was each good or what! Full of flavours and additionally each dish tasted so fresh. They used herbs and fresh sauces. Tried the portobello stuff mushroom, veggie pasta and pizza. Steamed dumplings (awesome!) Apple, pumpkin chick pea salad.Tom yum vermicilli. Carrot ginger pineapple juice was also so great. I am definitely going back and taking friends along. Keep it up Real food!! We need more like these restaurants around
5
I didn't expect the food to taste that good as im used to having some meat in my meals but boy was I wrong! Their food tasted so good! The beetroot burger didnt have a strong earthy taste to it, but it was packed with flavour! Im glad that I found this hidden gem!
5
We were so lucky to stumble across this restaurant while trying to find a money changer! Such a great variety of yummy foods from salads, to Asian dishes and plenty of new ideas and things we hadn't tried before! Felt very safe with the gluten free choices and some of the best things on the menu were vegan. Yum. Great place - check it out
5
Visited the Real Food Cafe for breakfast, and it was a lovely way to start the day. The gluten free waffles are just delicious! We also had the yummy mushroom omelette and freshly made juices. A fresh and healthy and tasty way to start the day. Huge servings and nice service, and a well designed cafe space. Highly recommended
5
Holidaying as a vegan is very hard to do but Real Food made this super easy! We went everyday for 6 days straight and never got bored of the menu. The fried dumplings are superb, pasta is fresh and tasty and the noodles are very authentic. If I ever go back to Singapore, I will definitely be eating here daily
4
The noodles dry with mushrooms, the wedges made with organic potatoes, and the tea for throat recommended by the staff who saw that I was having an itchy throat... I could never be more satisfied. I ended up buying a box of the tea that got my throat feel really much better even after a meal. Yes, the tea is of organic ingredients too
5
We loved Real Food! We stayed across the street and ate here a handful of times during our visit to Singapore. We had amazing gluten free/dairy free waffles, scrumptious soup, noodles, and pizza. Everything was delicious! It's a little tricky to find, but it's in the basement of the shopping center at this address. Highly recommend
4
The atmosphere of this restaurant is coziness - like eating at home. Their food is not extremely delicious however, but is definitely very healthy. It tastes healthy, it made me feel healthy too.
5
Fresh ingredients , consistent quality , great to taste
All Vegetarian Menu.
Casual setting , reasonable prices
Do visit
2
I get that it's slow food but were they waiting for the mushrooms to grow? We had to give them 2 reminders. To make matters worse, there wasn't any apology or attempt to make amends. Such high handedness...
5
I read that Real Food Cafe was a good spot for vegan food, and though it took me some time to find, it was worth it. I had the pumpkin pancakes and a banana cacao shake, and both were divine. This was one of the tastiest and most creative meals I've had anywhere. I highly recommend it for vegetarians/vegans and lovers of organic, healthy food.Next time in Singapore I'll hurry back. It's a shame this restaurant is counter-service and in a food court in the basement of a shopping mall. The stellar menu deserves a more upscale eating experience
3
The first time I visited this cafe I was amazed. The food I ordered, Stuffed Veggie, surprised me with its look and taste. Pretty and yummy. The next day I came back with a friend. We ordered 2 different pastas but boy oh boy, we don't like them at all. The food were dry and bland. The atmosphere though, is quite comfy
4
The pumpkin pancakes are eggless!! And they taste really good. Perfect texture, taste and flavour. The mushroom burger is also good, highly recommended. The flavour is good and not too chewy. Very $$ thou, prices are higher than their website and they say that they have not updated their website. Ambience is nice, classic concept, quiet and a nice casual date or friends meet. Be expected to wait really long for your food. They took about 30mins to make pancakes!Overall food is great. Go there if you have time to spar
5
My family and I frequent this place a lot. It is a much smaller place than their Killiney road location but still serves amazingly fresh and organic food. It can be a little difficult to find if you are going here for the first time. It is in the basement along with the food court, but is an actual sit-down restaurant. I have tried many of their dishes: lentil burger, chickpea cake salad, pasta and their dumpling noodles. All their dishes are amazing and they are very open to accomadating your dietary restrictions. They have fresh juices as well - a must if you go here. If you are in the area, definitely check this place out, you will be pleased
5
Its one of the places in Clark Quay where you can eat organic foods specially if you are a vegetarian. They offer excellent choice of foods. Foods are very delicious and value for your money. The place is small and cozy. I love their drinks, definitely going back
5
The restaurant has a wide range of vegetarian and vegan food options. The cafe has a relaxed and positive vibe. Pick your food, choose a nice spot and have a relaxed long meal. We had the millet burger, dumplings and spring rolls all were very good. You can also shop a variety of organic products from their shop while there
4
The Real Food Cafe is small and has some nice vegan food options. Especially the raw chocolate dessert is amazing. I also had Japanese noodles which could have been a bit more spicy. The shop is great, some organic brands from Europe. They even stock spelt cookies which is really hard to find in Singapore
4
Had vegan burgers and noodle soup. The soup was bland but the burgers were tasty. If in the area, would come back.
1
Tasty? No. Original? No. Good portions? No. I'm a proud vegetarian and believe a veggie cuisine can be one of the most satisfying and tasty experiences. Real food is a real let down for me. I could cook better food with my eyes closed.
4
It is fairly quiet and not overly crowded, so it provides a convenient venue for our friends to meet and chat away the whole afternoon. Ambience is quite like "home" with several book shelves. I ordered the quinoa set the last time I had lunch here and I enjoyed the food alot. However during we order the baked rice set during this lunch and I was disappointed to find two deep fried items-mushroom and lotus coins. We requested for the salad to be changed to beetroot and apple salad instead of green salad. Do request for chilli as we only realised that it was available after seeing some customers with it and it looks yummy
5
Vegetarian and vegan dishes and lots of variety. Casual atmosphere - you order from a counter and get your eating utensils at a side table. Food was very tasty. I ordered the lentil quinoa burger. My friend ordered the dumpling noodle soup which was a bit bland.
4
Laid back restaurant with a very cosy atmosphere. It's not too noisy thus a good place to have a quality talk or just a read. There's books offered in the restaurant. The menu offered a good variety of vegetarian dishes. Ordered the steamed dumpling as recommended by reviews but find it average. The salad i ordered - stuffed vegetable with beetroot patty was decent. The pumpkin soup is of very generous portion. We also ordered a drink call nourish your heart which ingredients include coconut oil, molasses, soymilk etc. Overall a decent vegetarian place
5
My review is for their new flagship place on Killiney Road right off Orchard. I love everything there: the decor, the service, the shop and the restaurant. Everything is yummy from the freshly squeezed juices to the food. Nice place to chill out and eat health
1
Decided to have lunch here, sadly everything we ordered they told us they could not cook, on the third attempt, we gave up. The staff spent most of the time in conversation ignoring us. After being told they still couldn't cook anything, we decided to leave and find a restaurant that actually served food on its menu
2
We ate lunch at real food cafe and were a bit let down. The service is good and the servers are friendly and prompt. However the food could have surely been better. They have lots of vegan options but we didn't enjoy most of the food we ordered The food lacked salt and sauces. No desserts here ether which was a let down Would not recommend this place.
4
Central is a really confusing place and it was very difficult to locate this restaurant. It is part of a food court. Having said that, it feels very good to have a healthy meal. I ordered the dumpling noodle and it was good - surprisingly it was also very filling and I could not finish the entire portion. On top of that there is very healthy juice as well
4
I really like the Real Food Cafe! I've been there a few times for a meal with my family and as we are strictly vegetarian, this cafe is an amazing choice for us. I love their brown rice friend rice as well as their sweet potato wedges! This restaurant is a must try for vegetarians and people who wish to live a healthy lifestyle!
3
Had the pumpkin pancakes only two small pancakes bit overpriced. Staff were nice. They dont have a coffee machine.
5
The dumpling noodles here really surprised me. The portion I had for lunch was generous and so delicious. I was rather skeptical at first... how could vegetarian healthy dumpling noodles taste nice? Well, now I'm a fan. Amazing and I would gladly come back for it
5
This is an absolute go to place when you like simple, delicious, trustworthy, healthy food. I go there really often and even order take away. You can't go wrong on any of the dishes.I really like the salads, potato and egg vinaigrette and the new orange pumpkin one.Their dumplings are one of the best !Freshly pressed juices, warming teas... everything is good.It is also vegetarian and mainly organic.Some of the dishes are gluten-free.The price is more expensive than average places in Singapore. But still reasonable when you want healthy organic food.Some of their dishes have been revamped and are a bit smaller unfortunately, I hope they continue the good, healthy good portions. I totally recommend it
4
Every time I eat here I realise that there is just not enough good wholesome food in Singapore.Everything here is fresh and really tasty. The menu choice is extensive too though on a couple of occasions, some items haven't been available but I tend to visit after the traditional lunch time.Plenty of great vegan and gluten free choices too. I highly recommend this place
4
There were not so many people when I went there so the service was quick and I liked the cozy atmosphere. The selection of books was a great addition, especially when going there alone. And of course, great yummy food! You can taste that they use good quality ingredients
3
Went to Real Food with my family for the first time a few days ago, I had their Beet (Millet) Burger which was really delicious, their aglio olio and pizza were ok, though they forgot some of my orders so we needed to wait for 30 minutes++ for the pizza and the aglio olio. However, there are lots of great options and I love the grocery, the sell various items which are not available in my city! Would visit again
4
Fantastic Menu of vegetarian and vegan meals. I felt spoilt for choice and went back the next day to order something different! There is a warning on the menu that the meals take about 15 minutes to prepare - this is because it is fresh and it is worth the wait.They have a choice of fruit juices, smoothies, coffee's and tea. Water cost 50Â¢. There is no WI-FI. Location in shopping mall at Clarke Quay MRT
4
Although it's a bit tricky to locate, Real Food is now a standby choice for me whenever I come to Singapore. The food is wonderful and, despite their disclaimers about slow food taking time, it usually arrives quite quickly. Do try the sweet potatoes! Their adjacent natural foods shop has a small but excellent selection of items that are not so easy to find in Singapore (real salt, flax and chia seeds, kale chips, organic tea, etc.), so you can enjoy a meal and replenish the larder, hooray! The only reason this isn't a 5-star review has to do with service, which is brusque at best. The counter staff does actually smile, though, which is refreshing. :
4
After 4 days in Singapore, we were looking for hot,fresh Indian food & initially headed out for AnnaLakshmi. They were closed and after asking few folks about veg restaurant, reached real food.We were famished after long walks and wanted a wholesome meal. Delighted by the choices for vegetarians, we ordered spring rolls, pizza and salad. Food was great and so was their effort to build sustained ecosystem. No extra plates were given if the food can be picked & eaten. This is an amazing organic cafe, and their meals are delicious! Will remember the smiling faces & food prepared from fresh produce
4
Went over to the Real Food Cafe on a friend's recommendation - excellent Beet burger, great Tom Yam soup with vermicelli, awesome Fried Tofu with a tangy / spicy dip - couldn't complain.Probably priced a little on the high side - but then again this is Singapore - good variety in the selection on the menu - all in all was refreshingly good and I will definitely be back
5
Loved it. Salads for both of us. Fresh squeezed juices in combos not tried by us before. Nice atmosphere as kind of oasis in busy market food hall.
4
This is an amazing organic cafe, and their meals are delicious! A tad expensive, but hey that's Singapore for you! I would definitely recommend this if you're after a healthy yet delicious meal whilst in Singapore :) Do come here for breakfast/brunch - ahhhhhh-mazing.
5
This place has wonderful vegan cakes and delicious vegetarian food.
Nice quiet place to eat, with high quality food. Condiments are excellent.
yes!
5
I wanted to eat local, but was struggling in some places to identify / request meat free dishes. This is the perfect solution. I ordered a noodle dish, with some spring rolls & a fresh juice. Perfect portion size (the spring rolls were a naughty addition, but sooo worth it). Everything was fresh & flavoursome, & served within about 15mins. I will definitely return & I'm only here for a week. Gotta try those dumplings :)FYI - for those without local knowlwedge, the restaurant is located inside Clarke Quay Central shopping centre, down one level from the street
4
I have a clean diet and I have to eat dairy-free products. Having done some research, I finally found this place that meets my diet needs. Love the spread of health food selection at their little retail corner. They have everything I need to cook at home! That aside, I had my brunch at The Central outlet. I don't have very picky tongue so the food fits me to the T. Portion was appropriate and the ambience of the place makes it conducive for a small gathering with friends. This would probably be a place I would keep going back to for a long time
3
Reading all the rave reviews, I decided to try out this place with a vegetarian friend yesterday. Unfortunately we had a mixed experience with our dinner that left us feeling less than satisfied. My friend ordered a beet (millet) burger and I ordered mixed vegetable balls pasta with tomato sauce. We also ordered their signature dumplings, fried, to share and an organic ginger beer each.Both of us enjoyed the dumplings and the ginger beer. Since the dumplings were fried, they were crispy and the crunch added to the flavours. The ginger beer was crisp and refreshing.My friend’s burger was served with sweet potato “wedges” – they were not so much wedges in the traditional sense as they were 2 cuts of sweet potato. Other than that my friend enjoyed her burger after adding some salt.My pasta dish was below expectation – the vegetable balls were dry and the tomato sauce didn’t have any flavour. Also there wasn’t enough sauce so the entire dish was very dry and unappetising overall. I guess being a health food restaurant they try to stay away from adding too many spices but spices are not unhealthy. Adding them in moderation will only make their food more flavourful and add to the health benefits. There is no harm in adding little salt and pepper!The ambience of the restaurant is nothing to write about. Being in the basement there are no windows and it is not the place to sit around after meal
1
I am sure this review would be an anomaly seeing how many rave comments there are about the place.Truth be told, that was the sole reason I decided to head there for lunch. I arrived with high expectations; but left utterly disappointed and cheated.My friend and I each ordered the 'The Original Pancake'. It was stated on the menu that it would take 15 minutes so we duly waited.15 minutes passed. 30 minutes lapsed.45 minutes went past. 60 minutes later and we were still waiting for our pancakes!After another 5 minutes the first plate arrived. The second didn't appear till another 10 minutes were clocked.So in total, I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for my pancake! How ludicrous was that? This despite me reminding the waitress of my long wait. And was it worth the wait, you ask? Absolutely not! The pancake, if you could even call it that, was abysmal at best. It was devoid of taste, texture, and appearance. It was flat not fluffy, it was charred, tasteless, looked like the carrot cake one finds in the hawker centre. Actually I am being unfair...to the carrot cake because at least that tastes divine regardless where you have it. The reason I had half of it was because I needed to being hungry and grumpy, and not because I wanted to.I am obliged to think that this was a bad day in the kitchen and tempted to give them a second chance. But I doubt I will because I was real flabbergasted by the entire experience
4
If I lived in Singapore, I would be a regular here. I had a beautiful, hearty salad. The menu was quite comprehensive and included breakfast options, as well.They have coolers lining one of the walls were customers sit, so you can see all the lovely fresh produce. There are books that you can browse through while enjoying your meal, which is a thoughtful addition that I took advantage of. I hope this cafe does well
4
I found this place when trying to find some vegetarian food in Singapore and I was super happy that I did. I loved the food here and returned 4 times in two weeks!Great menu of food and drinks for lunch and dinner.My only regret is that I never made breakfast. If you like good vegetarian food and are in Singapore you should definitely check this out
5
This is one of our favorite new places in Singapore. The food is healthy, fresh, and creative. Perfect place for those with specific diet requests or just looking to eat a bit healthier. A shining example of how eating healthier doesn't mean sacrificing taste.The menu specifically breaks down vegetarian items, vegan items, etc. It has a mix of pastas, soups, sandwiches, salads and juices. We especially recommend the fried dumplings.The prices are shockingly low. Our items were around $10 each and generous portions.The atmosphere is laid back with a casual cafe type feel. We only wish there was one within walking distance
5
This restaurant was amazing featuring fresh and seasonal vegetarian and vegan dishes. There are so many options and a great selection of fresh juices. Please support this amazing restaurant in Singapore!
4
two thumbs up for the people behind this cafe. the food is good and value for money however could do with a little more seasoning. we love the design.
5
Fresh, Organic well combined dishes, if you love your body, eat here! See my other review for Real Food...
3
We had a really nice breakfast here but, even though they say that real food takes time, three omelettes and full breakfast should not take forty-five minutes to come out, and should not come out one at a time so that the first person has finished before the last one has got his food. Not a social experience at all. Having worked in cafes and restaurants, it is possible to produce good food from good quality ingredients in less time.The quality of the ingredients and the taste of the food recommend this place but don't go if you are in a hurry
5
Real Food Cafe is an excellent choice for vegans/vegetarians. Lots of healthy options at extremely reasonable price with good portions that will keep you full and happy. They offer a selection of salads, soups, rice, pasta, juices etc. Several outlets available across Singapore. They also have a grocery section for you to take some healthy ingredients home with you
3
As our office is around Central, we had a couple of meetings held in Real Food which is located at the basement.I was initially hesitant when my colleague suggested having a meeting there because I am not a great fan of organic stuff. However when I tried the dumpling noodle, it really surprised me. Was really yummy and the tea selection on the menu was massive though they will always tell you this and that are not available. The only thing that sucks is the service of sales staffs who doesnt really seem to bother much other than taking and serving your order.
4
I have a good friend who's vegetarian and am always on the lookout for places that we can eat together. Found this vegan place on the web and decided to give it a shot.Reached on a Thursday evening and it wasn't too crowded. The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, felt like I could chill here and have a cuppa in the afternoons, read a magazine and have a chitchat with friends. There were magazines and CDs on display as well.I had the mushroom aglio olio. Portions weren't huge, but enough for a lady like me. If you were a guy, you might need 2 portions. Haha. Taste was not bad. My friend had the wanton noodle. We also had a organic cola and fruit tea. What is an organic cola, pray tell? Well it tastes less fizzy and only slightly less sweet than Coca cola (comparable in sweetness level), and probably you feel healthier drinking an organic cola. Hurhur. Ended with a choc cream cake (but it had no cream... Why is it called a cream cake?), tasted more brownie-ish to me, but was quite alright.Spent about $35 for the 2 of us? Considered cheap to my standards. Service was ok, the staff took our order decently and cleared our tables promptly (I don't have high expectations in Singapore). I left feeling quite glad that such a place exists in the midst of the junk food nation. I would come back again for sure (but probably not if I had a meat craving).
4
I had several meals here while travelling recently. All were tasty , fresh and most important for me gluten free. It's always nice to find a place that caters for food allergies as it can often be hit and miss when travelling. Loved their lemon cheesecake and brown rice and almond milk. Service an be slow but there are plenty of great magazines to read so the wait didn't bother me - besides I was on holidays.
4
Decadent gluten free slices SGD 6.00 to SGD 7.80. Pricy but will give you a chocolate or sweet fix to have with your coffee. My partner was buying up at a patisserie so I happened upon Real Food to give me something special to have with my suppertime coffee. I purchased one each of the three GF slices on display however I would recommend the berry cheesecake over the two chocolate slices. Vegan and other GF produce also available

I love "clean" food - organic where possible. The Real Food Cafe feels like it is in Norway or Sweden....light furniture and white walls - very cool indeed. Great books and information to read. The food is vegetarian and fantastic - it is always full - a great sign isn't it....go there - the "beet" burger is awesome...soups great - have a juice and put chia seeds in it. - the best raw chocolate brownie ever..
