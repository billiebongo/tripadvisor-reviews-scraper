We went there yesterday evening looking for a good North Indian chat place in Syed Alwi road and accidentally went here with my family. We ordered Pani puri and it was authentic and we loved it. Next we ordered samosa Pav which was interesting and Pav Bajji and both of them the taste was very delicious and kids loved it. Finally we finished off with cutting chai and onion pakora which takes the prize as it was a perfect finale and we loved it. Authentic food with decent service by the team

Chaats are hands down the best I have had in Singapore so far.All the items in the menu are really delicious, reminds me of my times in Delhi. Gets a bit nosiy and crowded understandably so, due to heavy tourist crowds.If you miss the taste of North Indian food back home Bikaner express is the place to be

The service wad terrible. It took them 10 minutes to give us a menu. It took them another 20 to bring one cutting chai. The guy literally made individual trips to bring cutlery for each table separately. No wonder there are only 3 of the 13 tables occupied here at any time. Super slow
