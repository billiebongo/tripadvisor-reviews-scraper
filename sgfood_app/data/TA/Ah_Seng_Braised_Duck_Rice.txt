Very nice braised duck rice. Have been eating for many year. Smooth and tender sliced duck meat. Taste is still the same as last time. Price is mid-range.

Located in a hawker centre, be prepared to join the snaking queue or call ahead to get your order of their braised duck and pig offal. Though still satisfying, these could do with some greens and somewhat the regulars found these tasting better before the owner handed over the helm to his son

be prepared to wait a bit, the line here is always long, but worth it, as it is the best duck rice in Singapore in my opinion!You get a bowl, of rice with some juice, a bowl of ducksoup and a portion of smooth and tender sliced duck for around 7 $, absolutely delicious!also it is next door to chomp chomp in serangoon gardens, so it is easily accessible
