Although we reached very late for dinner, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Though we had to wait a little the Nans served to us were fresh and tasty. Both veg and non veg food was very tasty

I brought my wheel chair bound mother there for mother's day. The food was Awesome. The buffet and ala carte items were great. This place is opposite City Square Mall in Kitchener Road. This place is not accessible by wheel chair. The restaurant staff were kind to lift my mother with the wheelchair into the restaurant
