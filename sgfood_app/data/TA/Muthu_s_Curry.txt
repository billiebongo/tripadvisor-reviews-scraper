Went there for three times because it was recommended by one of my friends. But did no find anything special. Bit expensive compared the quality of the food.

Was happy we went here. Prices were very reasonable compared to some of the other Indian restaurants we came across. Was close to the The Hotel we were staying at (Pan Pacific) The food was very well presented, tasted great and was delivered in a timely manner. Was good being able to see the chefs in the kitchen through the glass window. The only thing they could improve on, is it didnt feel like you were in an indian restaurant. Not many decorations. Would definitely eat their again

My friend and I made our way to Race Course Rd and stumbled across Muthu's. We decided to try it.Like most Indian restaurants in this area, they have made dining casual : easy looking coffee shop style dining, spacious and in Muthu's, a clear view of a kitchen space through a clear glass window, where you could see kitchen chefs working their magic on the naan or dishes.While browsing the menu, I noticed that this restaurant also offered Dum Briyani, something which I have tried in another restaurant in the same area, and which I wanted to try again. So I asked if it was a big portion and the waiter kindly suggested to order 1 first, and to order the 2nd if insufficient. So we went with the order of 1 dum briyani, 1 chicken tikka, and 2 plain naan, along with 2 tea masala.The dum briyani looked really little, packed into a round tin dish, but turned out to be enough for us 2, with the accompanying naan and chicken. This mutton dum briyani was simply delicious, fragrant and not too dry...So was the chicken tikka, probably the best I've ever had...grilled and flavourful, and also not too dry...The naan was just plain...The tea was also good.The service was also good, paying attention to our need, like letting us ordering 1 to try first...We walked away very satisfied, and would come back again...without doubt

I was in the neighbourhood and decided to have a light lunch, it was very early 12noon. The restaurant was empty and I and my friend ordered traditional Indian food, vegetarian and non vegetarian (not Fish Head). The service was appaling (we were almost alone in this large restaurant and the food was indifferent

Fish head curry in Singapore is one of the must-try food when you come here. Muthu's Curry didn't disappoint us. We ordered the famous fish head curry together with naan, chicken wings appetizer, and a few other side dishes. Everything was tasty. The fish head actually had lots of meat and the sauce went well with rice and naan. I would come back to this restaurant
5
You could get completely turned off by the lack of a friendly welcome when you first enter or the unenthusiastic nature of their wait staff but if you don't sit and order the Fish head curry, you will be missing one of the most spectacular meals of your life. There's a reason they're known for this and once the aromas smack you in the face and the taste grabs onto your tongue you'll realize that your life is now complete. We ordered a number of items and everything was very good, but almost no other meal in my life comes close to the amazingness that is the Fish Head Curry
4
I have eaten at an Indian restaurant near Muthu's every time I have visited Singapore. One of my Singaporean friends said they prefer Muthu's so I gave it try. The food was excellent. Service was very good. And the decor is a step up from the 'other' restaurant I have frequented. The only thing holding me back from giving Muthu's a 5 star rating is the price. While prices are rising in Singapore, I didn't expect a non-alcoholic drink, rice and one dish to cost S$27. Those are almost NYC prices!But I do recommend the restaurant for a quality meal

We had a family gathering in end December 2017. The ambience and the staff were great. We had ordered an array of items which included, rice, naan, fish head curry, appetizers, vegetarian dishes. We had visited this same restaurant in the past, and sad to say the main dish fish head curry had lost the distinguished spice and sourness. There was a bitter undertone. We used to drink the extra curry but now nobody wanted to take the curry at all. It looked like they had adjusted the taste for the tourists. We were quite disappointed with the dish. The appetizers chicken 65 and fried prawn was good. But the fried cauliflower platter had a combination of unsalted and salted version. The dal dishes were good. The fish cutlet was good but the cauliflower manchurian was bitter. Hope the restaurant will consider checking their food again. Please do not change what had once been the best fish head curry place
4
The fish head is is still good but a tad less spicy from the last time we had it. Everything was ok and still good. Although the presentation did not look appetizing. However, once it is in the mouth, it brings back memories of how good it was then. Service was quick and pleasant. Now there is a glass panel that shows how the Nan is made while you dine. Portions of the fish head come in S, M L...we had the samll and it was quite filling.With an addition of two large prawns, potatoes, lime juice and rice it came to S$67.1
5
Loved the curries - so many to try. Tikka Masala, Vindaloo, Chicken 65, Butter Chicken and saag. Tried the Ghosht Sheekh Kebab for first time - really good. They have same flavors with fish, lamb and prawn - all good.
5
Best recommendation was the tandoor mutton Chop. The signature fish head curry had good review from the family - fresh, not fishy, not over cooked. Expect for the soggy and salty Gobi manchurian, everything else we order were very good.
4
Fabulous buttery chicken curry and fiery Mughal chicken. The fish head curry is good too. The naans are Super good with four different flavours. The tandoori chicken was dry and so disappointing.
2
Low value fof money.
Veryexpensive and very small portions.
Service is good, location is good. However ul end up spending a lot for not that much quality food.
5
Beautiful place for a local curry on a banana leaf. Fish head is one of their specialities. Parts are a bit like a canteen but the food speaks for itself. Worth the trip outside the city.
5
Friends recommended this restaurant by friends who then took us there. Fantastic Indian food, well cooked and delicious. Substantial menu which will satisfy all lovers of Indian cuisine. Famous for its fishhead curry, amongst other things. The Aloo Mutter was fantastic. Very popular with the local Indian community, which is a good sign, whilst also catering for foreign tourists.Reasonably priced, however the beer was cheap (by Singapore standards anyway)

Muthu's Curry is a well known family restaurant in Singapore serving delightful Indian cuisine. We dined at the it's outlet near Little India and enjoyed the mouthwatering delicacies. The restaurant offers a wide and varied Indian menu and it is a daunting task to try to choose the item of choice .. We ordered the Muthu special , the Fish head curry , plain rice, yellow lentil and Bhindi (Okra) bhaji and Chicken curry .. eating was an experience , every bit cooked to perfection .. Measurement of spices , the portions and the blend , when to add, at which stage of the cooking to add various spices is paramount in the preparation of palatable Indian cuisine .. These were done with masterful care and the result was a hugely delightful lunch us ..Good food, great cooking and inexpensive .. Recommended ..

This restaurant had always been a must visit for me whenever in Singapore.I had tried it a couple of years ago and food was really delicious.However today it was way below my expectation☹️☹️I looked forward to their signature Fish head curry and boy was I disappointed!the curry was tasteless,spices raw and it’s unique tanginess missing.It felt like the chef (If there was one qualified) just adds and mixes key ingredients together at last minute.As a fellow chef,I always recommend the chefs to taste their food before giving it to the customer.Missing simple things such as seasoning is appalling.The Mysore mutton was also in the same league.I believe once an established garners some name,they have a great responsibility of maintaining the same.This place is definitely off my list of must visits! It boasts of a good inviting ambience and the wait staff were efficient and kind,but the food was utterly disappointing.I wonder who is to blame-the Chef or the management
2
It was a toss up between Muthu's Fishhead curry and Banana Leaf nearby. But Banana Leaf was closed that evening. These were 2 known institutions so thought i couldnt go wrong picking either. The naan was the hardest thing ever and one couldmt even knock on it! When i commented to the waitress who agreed, i was shocked when she asked why did i eat it then??? At least I requested the chef made a new one; soft as it should be. The curry in which the fish head came in was too thick and the new chef had a heavy hand with spices. It was only 530-6pm so it could not be b'cos it was the end of the day. Maybe it was from yesterday??!! There wasnt much vegetables in the curry and a plate of vegetables would set one back at S$9. Not cheap.Noticing that nearly every table had foreigners dining including mine, i doubt they knew the quality from before. I will not return anytime soon. Their reputation has gone down

Had some challenges to choose THE place to have fish head curry. In the end Muthu´s seemed to have received plenty of good ratings of this legendary dish, so that was my destination.And yes, Fish Head Curry, was just as good as expected. The bowl it is served in, is huge. So if you are dining by yourself, as I did, the smallest one is more than enough.I ordered some rice and naan bread along.Fish Head is served in a rich and flavored curry souce, that has some okras and pineapples as well. Head was cooked for some time. Flavours were great. Personally I would have preferred to have more spiced up version, but this definatelly has some kick for a regular mouth.Highly recommendable
4
The best and fresh fish head curry in Singapore. Ordered 2 fish heads and both came out fresh and succulent. Service class act. Don't need to choose others. Just go right in!!!.
5
With several recommendations I went there for the famous Fish Head Curry - the national dish of Singapore. Was not disappointed at all. I ordered the small size, which I think is more than enough for 2 persons. IT WAS REALLY GREAT. I would suggest not to order any rice with that. May be some naan. The extended fish-head has a lot of meat to fill your stomach, satisfying your tastebud. A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED restaurant in Singapore
3
Pancake rolls lovely hot and fresh chicken masala cold and very spicy. Lamb chops hot and freshly prepared were really nice, only 2 small chops with pineapple. I wished they had served my chicken hot rather than just from the counter and it was too spicy for me. Restaurant was lovely and clean
5
Went to Muthu Curry Restaurant with family. Nice ambience spacious. Located at Race Course Road within Little India.Go for the Fish Head Curry which is my favourite. My kids love Naan bread which comes in butter, garlic or a plain ones and eat with the Butter Chicken curry...yummmmyyyh.They also have kebabs too. Try thier Dum Briyani either chicken or mutton. Spicy mutton masala or Gobi Manchuria (couliflower fried n with heavy spices)So dont missed it if you are thr corner.Cheer
5
Once in a while you feel like having something similar to what we eat at home, head over to this place. Reasonable and good taste. Seems their lemonade is pretty famous and you will see them on every table. Singapore trip will be incomplete without a visit here

Gone are the days where you can have fish head curry in Singapore at an Indian Coffee shop that's open air. For some reason, having fish head curry in the heat with sweat trickling down your face, makes the meal even more satisfying. Unfortunately, today the fish head curry restaurants are more like going to a fine dining restaurant. It was my dad's first trip in many years and first thing first was to look for fish curry meal for him. We googled for best fish head curry in Singapore and Muthu's Curry came up in the top 10 so we decided to give it a try. We went to Muthu's Curry straight from the airport for lunch. We got to the restaurant in no time and ordered fish head, lamb massala, vegetable and beef curry. The fish head was fresh and the gravy was delicious. The lamb massala, vegetable and beef curry was just as nice. Muthu's Curry deserves its top 10 ranking for fish head curry in Singapore for the quality and deliciousness of their food.Ambience of Muthu's is like a fine dining restaurant. Decor and furnishings are modern. The restaurant is spacious. They even have private rooms for special occasions or lunch meetings. The service overall is top notch. We were served promptly and efficiently. The 4 dishes meal cost us slightly over S$60; drinks included. I did not give a full rating for Muthu's for the reason it was not truly authentic in terms of experience. Food was great but I missed having fish head curry with full on perspiration from heat of the food and open coffee shop concept. However, if you're ever in Singapore and crave for fish head curry, I highly recommend Muthu's Curry. Two thumbs!

I have been eating muthu curry for decades as i was staying at little india area as i can recall. My first meal was when i was a teenager in 1998. the first meal in this restaurant was good Very nice curry fish head served with steam rice some vegetablez After so long i often dine in at muthu with my family and friend
4
Even from the outside, Muthu's Curry is very inviting. Brightly lit, lots of energy and activity everywhere. Service is prompt and efficient. We were seated had menus in hand and a Kingfisher beer on the way within seconds. A great range of protein based and vegetarian delights, but I decided to settle for the specialty of the house - Fish Head Curry. A wonderfully fragrant and spicy sauce created a welcome "moat" for the fish head - snapper in this case. The flesh of the fish was sweet and firm and flaky. A wonderful dish. A reasonable range of beers and wines on the list with our chosen option of the New Zealand Riesling being a classic combo for the curry. Will be back again
1
We have been to muthus curry before but recently the food quality had been terrible. Taste has reduced to large extent. Chicken chukka is my favorite there which isn't taste that way now. Signature fish head curry has also lost its uniquness. Wouldn't go next time.
4
My husband and I were in Singapore and we had a chance to catch up with our friends who are locals here. They picked us up from our hotel and we ended at Muthu's Curry for dinner. Our friends had made reservations in advance so we got a table right away.When we arrived at the table we were given a banana leaf on a tray. We were able to order from the table's digital menu. We immediately started ordering multiple dishes to include: fish head curry (the best!!!), curry mutton, Gobi Manchurian, and a few other items that now I can't remember. Everything was delicious.All the food was delicious and highly recommend. Each couple got a side dish of rice to shar
3
Food was quite good, but what I would expect from any Indian restaurant. Very spacious and air conditioned. Didn't like ordering on an iPad.
5
The place is clean, staffs are good and friendly. Variety of choices and the best test! Don't hesitate.
5
I have been to this restaurant many times every time I order the famous Fish head it is very delicious it's really value for money
4
When I entered, I thought its just another Indian outlet around that area. But surprised by the ambience, promptness in service and taste and variety of food.

I went to Muthu's Curry for lunch today with my colleague. We ordered white rice (which came with brinjal and cabbage), chicken tikka, squid (squid sambal), tiger prawns, and butter chicken, and for dessert, we had home-made kulfi and masala tea.It seemed like a posh restaurant with a nice ambience. The lighting was adequate, and the food was well displayed.As for the food, I was dismayed on many counts. First the vegetables that came with the rice were cabbage and brinjal. I would expect this from a coffee shop down the road but not from a restaurant that is trying to project a premium image.Secondly the brinjal tasted sweet. The waiter told me they added sugar. If you are genuinely serving Indian food, there is no need to add sugar. What is important is the taste of the spices in the food and not sugar.The chicken tikka was also sweet and tasted more like barbequed chicken pieces.The home-made mango kulfi was too sweet for our liking. We could not taste the cardamom because the taste and sweetness of the mango was overpowering.Finally, the masala tea was lukewarm and we could hardly taste the spices.The rest of the food was nothing to brag about.Other than that, the waiters are couteous and helpful. That made the experience pleasant. However, I will think twice about going back
4
This is a great place to meet up with friends for dinner the staff are very friendly and helpful but the service is all over the place.The restaurant was not that busy when we arrived and we waited ages for our drinks,we had to ask for more menus as we had one between 6 of us.The staff use a tablet to order everything,but although they are very sweet they seem rather vacant and disorganized.The food is very good,but we felt the portions were very small and ended up ordering way more dishes than we would usually do when we go for a curry together
4
Great courteous service. Waiter even chatted and explained the dishes to us. Fish head curry was delicious, however one fish head for 4pax wasn't sufficient, a whole lot of gravy but not fish. Aloo pratha was good and so was the Dum Chicken Bryani. Enjoyed the meal
4
I went to Muthu's Curry with friends and we were served by a lovely lady called Sara. She was very attentive and made recommendations about what we should order. We ended up having Fish Head Curry, Chicken Curry and Naan, and it was all lovely! We were a little worried about trying the Fish Head City, but it's the specialty and if you can get over the big bones (that are easy to pick out), the sauce is absolutely delicious. It's not cheap, but it's clean with good service
2
This is the first below average meal I've had in Ilttle Inida - and one of the more expensive. Order taken quickly, but after 2 reminders and eventually going to the bar, drinks served just after the food arrived. The chicken was overcooked, dry and not as hot as it ought to have been - I suspect it had been heated up numerous times until eventually served to me. The garlic naan was cold and dry, not moist like in other places, so I sent it back. It arrived back about 2 minutes later after being zapped in the microwave - the bowl it was in was very hot to touch. It was now even drier and inedible, so I returned it. Dahl was not up to the standard of elsewhere. At almost $50 with taxes and services a very expensive - and disappointing meal - there are far better value and better tasting food - served in many establishment close by. I won't return

I was at Muthu's Curry to celebrate my colleague's 30th anniversary in the company.The service standards need improvement!I ordered a glass of orange juice, it took well over 30 minutes to arrive. We ordered a lot of food and to our dismay the food was not up to the standard we expected of this highly recommended restaurant.The grilled lamb chops were too soft and lack the grilled meaty flavour of the lamb. It was so heavily spiced that I couldn't taste the actual flavour of the meat. The grilled fish was ok but I felt that it was a bit salty. The mutton curry was quite hard and tough. The grilled chicken drumstick was also too soft and too heavily spiced. It lack the grilled meaty flavour that all grill meats should have. The fish head curry was fresh and good. The flavour was well balanced and tasted delicious. The naans go well with the fish head curry. The service was lacking and we needed to remind the service staff of our orders and it takes a while before they responded.We spent well over $2k at this restaurant and I felt that the food was overpriced and the only dish that we enjoyed was the fish head curry with naans and rice.I strongly recommend this place, if you like fish head curry. Other than that, I think I can get better food and service at other nearby restaurants
5
Being Indian, I know my curries, but Muthu's was a nice surprise. South Indian flavours, very distinct from north Indian. Loved the prawns, the mutton. Lots of vegetarian options too.
3
This restaurant didn't disappoint, we had been there before and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and good basic food. It isn't great quinine but good basic food ideal to share with friends.
5
the food is always served freshly prepared and the crab masala .
is excellent .my wife and daughter are vegan and they always enjoy the wonderful vegan curries and tandoori fare
4
Nice air conditioned restaurant. Authentic South Indian food the type that my wife and I like. Serves cold beer which is a plus in Singapore.Food was well prepared and plenty of dishes to choose from. You are welcome to eat with your fingers which is the right way of enjoying and eating South Indian food. Restaurant was clean and staff were friendly and attentive. Will always come back to MUTHU'S when in Singapore.I recommend this place to all lovers of South Indian food.Dr Harindarjit SinghAuckland New Zealand 21 May 201

My business friend decided to give me a treat at Muthu's Curry Restaurant yesterday. It's situated along Race Course Road, within the Little India conclave.We ordered their signature dish which is the Southern Indian Fishhead Curry (small) for the three of us . The fish curry dish was spicy and delicious. In addition, we also offered a dish of tandoori chicken and brinjal and papadam(Indian Crackers).The restaurant is certainly worth a visit for a business lunch or family dinner
5
Visited for an evening meal following a recommendation by a taxi driver. What a lovely meal served by a waitress with a huge smile. The food was delicious especially the Peshwari Nan and the butter chicken was outstanding. Prices were fair for the area and the selection of dishes extensive. The atmosphere was friendly and if we ever return for another stopover we will definitely return.
5
I was on a business trip to Singapore and was invited by my colleges over dinner. Our hostess for the evening "Sara" suggested popular dishes from the restaurant pottery and we ordered fish fry, chicken chukka and chicken tandoori. All items were up to the mark and we enjoyed a lot, the food was just amazing. The service was really good. Thanks to Sara:) The hotel serves alcohol
5
Sara took our order. But didn't want to serve us the dishes we chose. Instead she suggested the Chili Chicken (dry) with Romali Roti. She was quite persistent and convinced we would like it. So, we listened. And we're happy we did!!It was very tasteful. Rich, dry, spicy curry. Tender (boneless) chicken. The roti is a really, really good match. It's light and less greasy. We also enjoyed the Masala Fish.Fish cubes in a rich, light, spicy gravy. Thanks Sara! :)We'll be back for sure.
2
To start off, I'm a Chinese Singaporean born in Singapore . I love good food and I don't care which country are they from . 10 years ago I went to this very outlet a few occasions for their curry fish head , I was totally blown away by its flavorful aroma and taste. I brought my client to this restaurant twice this year , both time it disappoint me so much and was so embarrass to bring my client to this lousy restaurant . Curry fish head was really not fresh , curry was not good either and after my meal I had diarrhea the next day. And also I notice there was a lot of other ethics of customers there except for Indian themselves so I assume this restaurant had lost her former trust and can only attract tourist and non Indians here
4
Chicken Tikka Masala, Masala Prawns, Fish Head Curry (Signature Dish) and Muthu's Chicken Chukka are the excellent dishes in Muthu's Curry which are a MUST to try.The restaurant in Race Course Road is just an excellent choice to bring your bosses, your loved ones or even your friends to enjoy lunch and dinner.The seats are comfortable and the restaurant is spacious for everyone to walk around and mingle around.My excellent choice of dining restaurant
5
Amazing Dinner. Outstanding chicken masala, fish cutlet and ohhh the lamb chops. The fried fish was also amazing. And what a bonus to have great service - Narayanan made us feel so much at home!!!! A definite must to re-visit!!!
5
Very nice service and delicious food - highly recommend! We went there and had an amazing dinner. The food wasn't not just good, it was also the service which was so good!
2
The food contains too much of coloring! Everyday its the sample vegetables given esp the Cabbage !!
Service isn't efficient and very congested restaurant!
1
of course you hv no idea what I m saying if you no nostalgia.
the atmosphere n particularly the fishhead curry. the flavour is gone.
today 3 feb 16 wld be my last muthu.
5
This is not my normal first choice for restaurant along race course road. Now it is! We had freshly made Romali roti, tandoori roti, naan and rice, tekka masala chicken, Mysore mutton, Parler paneer, masala prawns, aloo gobi and finish off with some curd. Very satisfied
4
The moment you hop in a cab and ask them to take you to a restaurant on race course road , the driver would instantly ask you you wanna go to Muthu curry yaa :)Well the hotel is indeed quite famous , the interiors are quite well done and the food menu has a lot of variety in it . The most famous dish here of course is the fish head curry if you are a fish fan .. for others there are a lot of veg and non veg dishes to choose from . the mutton varieties are also quite good The have the main curry items displayed so you can actually have a look before ordering this is quite helpful .
5
Although we do not live in Singapore permanently, we make a point of visiting Muthu's Curry restaurant whenever we are in town. The restaurant has maintained high standards over many years. In fact the service we had tonight by Sara and Nanda was the very best we ever had. Our most favored dishes are chicken Chukka and mouton Chukka. The only slightly negative point we could mention is that the starter - crispy finger ladies - far too oily for our taste. Thank you and compliments to the Muthu's team for yet another most enjoyable meal
4
We came here for dinner to try the restaurant's specialty, fish head curry but also ordered some other dishes from the menu. All the dishes were tasty. The service staff were friendly and helpful, however they forgot to bring us one of the dishes we ordered. It was a pleasant meal and reasonably priced
5
While in the 'Little India' part of Singapore,this restaurant is certainly recommended for its famous signature dish of the South Indian Fish Head Curry.Served with plain rice and eaten from a banana leaf covered plate,this spicy curry cooked with vegetables is an unique,not to be missed gourmet experience.On the menu, is also a wide variety of Indian meat,chicken & vegetable dishes and breads to suit every taste.A good variety of wines & alcoholic drinks are also available.Service is excellent and prompt
4
My husband and I just ate at this restaurant. We split a basket of naan and butter chicken, and we each had so. It was S$40 for a meal, which I thought was very overpriced. But the butter chicken was great and the naan was phenomenal! Lima soda is also tasty
3
When with my wife & brother-in-law. Order Fishhead ;Naan Basket(Plain/Garlic/Butter/Kulchai )Black Pepper Squids ....Squids was a little let down....Squids taste was flat.Naan was not Crispy enough.Fresh lime Soda & Juice was a little too sweet.
5
We went with our friends. All of us like the foods very much. The foods are really delicious. The service also very good, especially the waiter Sara is very kind, she helped us to choose the dishes.
4
Always a good place for a curry with friends. There are a few of these stores in Singapore. The fish head curry is pretty good, service is very Indian!
5
My friend who lives in Singapore took me tothis place. It was heaving in the evening. We have different variey of dishes and the their signature fish head curry (apprently won awards quite a few times) was very tasty indeed. If you like seafood in hot and spicy style, don't forget to visit this place. Good service and they also serve decent alcholic beverages. One thing - they stopped making one of the recommended dishes - seafoof sizzler
2
Our party of 6 had dinner at this restaurant on a Saturday night , 7:30pm. The tables were about 75% occupied. The staple servings of fish head curry, naan, butter chicken etc were ok but prices slightly higher than other Indian restaurants in the vicinity.. Our bill came to S$180 for 4 adults and 2 kids.I will not recommend this place unless you are prepared to face the indifferent attitude of the service staff. No smile, no eye contact but try to avoid you all the time. Its difficult to place additional orders or request for refills. I will not patronise them ever again. I've also dine at Banana Leaf Apolo before, at 54, Race Course Road and their service is definitely much, much better for a lower price
4
A must if you are visiting Singapore! Although there are a few of their restaurants in Singapore we went to the one in Little India.The staff were helpful and the food was quite good. You have to order their famous Fish Head curry.Is a must when we return!
3
This "popular" restaurant which prides itself on "Fish head" has outlived its reputation. Whilst I did not try the "fish head" curry, I ordered Chettinad chicken curry and my friend ordered a South Indian speciality from the menu. Neither of the dishes were authentic. The price was shockingly high
4
We visited this restuarant for couple of dinners to enjoy some delicious indian food, however, the choices for the vegetarians are limited.Staff very attentive, but should pay attention to the bills, as we were charged for dishes we didn't order (must be because was very busy being a Saturday evening)
3
Went after a while to this restaurant. Chicken 65 turn out to be cooked long time back and was not at all good. Looks like during lunch, all food got prepared and kept in warm. Saw menu now have briyani in addition to usual items. Service charge but no courtesy to ask for water or anything else to serve. Usual fish head carry was OK. Briyani nothing much to say, typical South Indian type.
4
It was on my wife's suggestion that we decided to try the restaurant and absolutely enjoyed the food. We started with fried fish and crabs which were great followed by roomali Rotis and mutton Vindaloo and butter chicken.The crabs are a must try and best eaten with sleeves rolled up and using your hands.The ambience was good and the service was attentive, although we did need to give a couple of reminders for the roti.Overall a must try with some patience if you don't order in one go
4
Muthu's has a respectable claim to coming up with the idea of fish head curry; now run by the founder's son, this shop continues to draw the crowds....
The waiting staff are very rude and impolite.
The food is great...Must try
4
Enjoyed the food overall, location was central between two MRT stations.
Overall good was very flavourful and delivered quickly by attentive server.
Prices were a bit on the high side compared to other Indian restaurants in the region but overall enjoyable.
5
Excellent service. Buzzy place!!! Full of laughter and well fed people including a wedding reception!!! Fish head not for faint hearted but our wonderful waiter Narayan showed us how to eat it! Hot and spicy. Nice!
1
The food was below average and service was poor. Mutton in the briyani was quite hard to bite. Food was more pricey than the other restaurants along Race Course Road. Mango Lassi was at $7! What irked me the most was that the menu stated the price for the curries ($2 for fish curry, $2 for rasam) and you had to buy gravy dish if you wanted to buy a set of naan. If you're thinking of coming here, I think you're better off going over to Banana Leaf Apollo or Sakunthala's which are just along Race Course Road
5
Went here with my Wife to check out the food. Everyone keeps talking about the fish head curry, but we wanted to try some out of the norm. We ordered Muthu's special chicken, palak paneer, fish cutlet. The service was brilliant. We were really impressed with the quality and so was the quantity. Definitely recommend to all. Verdict: quality and quantity goes hand in hand. You shall never ever forget Muthu's Curry
4
I have visited this restaurant with my family and everyone enjoyed the food. This restaurant is located little bit quite than other parts of the Little India. Will definitely return next time. Pros:1. Nice location 2. No waiting on queue3. Served with in 10 minutes of order 4. Service was ok5. Food was great especially fish head curry, Mutton chukka, Chicken 656. Everyone enjoyed 7. Good ambiance 8. Clean toilets Cons:1. Fish head curry was good however little bit chilli powder smell. 2. Terrible naans3. South Indian Parottas are not available 4. Chicken Biryani was good however it was cold5. Too much quantity of fish curry. We wasted. We ate the fish but except curry
5
visited in a party of 4 - two couples. both enjoy Indian food and familiar with options. Facilities had been upgraded since last here - maybe 2 years back. Food overall still excellent. Had a wide range of dishes so all shared all of us were really happy with the food provided. Local Singaporeans introduced to 2 new naans - Kashmiri and Peshwari - and went " wow" !! Meat and vegetarian dishes all excellent. Strongly recommended for top flight food

This place is very expensive. Also the dishes served doesn't taste like authentic real Indian restaurant. Heard fish head curry is famous here, so we ordered the same. Curry had grapes and pineapples in it which really looked odd for us as there won't be any fruit in any of our Indian curry. Also the server suggested Naan for fish curry which is weird as fish curry goes well with white rice or idly/dosa. Overall it was ok experience
4
The Food is good, the spread is nice and full marks to Mr Nanda and Mr Ramesh who waited at our tables, always ready with suggestions, extremely polite and served affectionately (I hate grumpy or stuck up servers). The food was well prepared- The Malabar Fish Curry and The Mutton curry were excellent. The portions for the price are very small however worth visiting while in Singapore
3
Was at Muthu's curry with a big group recently. Maybe its because of the big group, they were clearly disorganised and struggling to keep up. Food wise, not everything was impressive. we had at least 8 to 10 dishes. The fish curry was good. the butter chicken was probably the best dish that we had. Bottomline, not overly impressed with the place
5
over from and visted on a wet saturday night 2 chicken mulagatorny soups lamb rogan keema nan & kingfisher beer served with a welcome smile.
5
This is my 3rd visit to muthus
Taste is unique and this is a place you should never miss if you go to Singapore
Price are very reasonable
5
If you come to Singapore you must try this out. This is one most popular Indian Food Restaurants. Food is great and so is the service.
5
Our family came here on the morning of Deepavali and didn't expect too much of the restaurant. As soon as we got in. We're amazed by the atmosphere of the dining hall. Large selection of menu for different types of proteins from chicken to lamb. Highly recommend the fish head curry that cost SGD22 for 3 pax.
4
This restaurant is renowned for its curries with a long established history. We were not disappointed. The fish head curry was well seasoned, spices were cooked through and the big clay pot with a large piece of Sea Bass was cooked to near perfection. The okra and pineapple pieces are all added to accentuate and enhance our taste buds.The large restaurant area with ample seating is delightful and authentic. Waiting staff are polite and friendly. Traditional tandoor ovens used to freshly cook naan and chicken. Prices have risen since our first experience many years ago however the great taste and experience has not changed. Well done Muthu and Little Indi
4
A well run nice restaurant for families, friends and couples. Nice decor and friendly service. Highly recommend the fish head curry. We were only two so hit a food wall after the fish head curry and mutton vindaloo and would have loved to have tried more. Would go back again for sure
1
My friends and I visited the restaurant recently for a late lunch. We were not terribly hungry and decided to keep lunch light. Upon being seated, the waiter heavily promoted the fish head curry- we explained that 4 of my friends were vegetarians and the waiter gave an annoyed look. We ordered 3 main dishes, 4 sides and 4 servings of rice. 5 minutes later, the 'supervisor' came by and said that we didn't order enough food and that sides didn't count as food (?!?!?). I demanded to see where the rule was written re minimum order. He said it was not written anywhere but it is a 'known practise' and that we had to order at least 2 more main dishes. Utterly ridiculous and rude- I am confident that he did so because we were tourists. We ended up leaving without eating. We subsequently wrote to the singapore tourist promotion board and this is currently being investigated. Tourists beware- do be prepared to order a min amount if you plan to visit
5
Surprisingly. Their fish curry (regular one without the head) has a much more pungent flavour. Order that instead. They make some of the most firm & delicious tandoori rotis here. Their tadka dal is supreme as well. And of course top off that heavy meal with some hearty masala chai. Topic is over.
5
Had dinner here with my friends and we each ordered their delicious Briyani rice along with a couple of side dishes as per recommended by my friend; the butter chicken (MUST TRY ESP WITH NAAN BREAD), chicken tandoori, paalak paneer (spinach gravy with cottage cheese yummmmy), and curry mutton! Prices here are reasonable and the ambience is amazing! I went to the outlet at Little India. I'll definitely return
4
I had dept lunch today in this chain restaurent.Service is good. Staffs friendly. Customer oriented.Food is good, esply the fish curry the signature dish with 3 different prices of size. It is less salty compared to the ones next doors. Next recommended dish - chicken curry but serving is small.Nan - bread is fresh and excellent. I have nothing to complaint.Overall impression is good meal putting aside the price tags.
3
Its on the top list of the most popular Indian food in Singapore.
Unfortunately their portions are too little for their price.
Services is poor and not many choices on the menu.
Not reccomended
5
Had a lovely lunch at Muthu's Curry. One of the best Tandoori chicken. Mutton biryani was authentic and not too oily. Nice big chunks of meat. Saw lots of people ordering fish head curry, must be good. Highly recommend the place.
5
Indian cuisine is definitely one good choice if you want something different from typical Singaporean food. This restaurant is clean and cosy with really good and authentic Indian food. Highly recommend the Curry Fish Head. Great taste.
3
The food is delicious, but over priced. Servings are very small. We visited during lunch hours. Ordered Malabar fish curry and few more curries with Naan
3
Overall nothing really can be shouted about my dinner at Muthu's Curry. The food is ordinary as you can experience in other India curry outlets. However the food is pricy by my standard. One can have the same experience at lower cost.
3
Dried Mutton was quite plain in taste and vegetables are normal. Not "WOW".
nevertheless, Masala tea and Moree Ice (spice yogurt drink) were great.
That's all.
3
The restaurant looked modern. Service is not very good. They have forgotten to bring our starter even though we were very specific about it.The portions are not big, so we had to order more bread with cheese. The starting dish that they usually bring in the beginning came before the main course. We actually had to ask to bring our main course and it was not hot. To the request to bring some napkins - they completely ignored it. Food portions, value and price are not valued right.
3
This restaurant has a history. It was one of the early restaurant serving fish head curry and popular with the doctors at the old KK Hospital. Today it has a modern deco which is evident of the success they have had. It still serves great fish head curry and the other south Indian delicacies although they now also serve some north indian cuisine. I still like the banana leave style rice - they now serve it on a banana leave but on a smaller tray. Looks too pristine
5
My family has been dining at Muthu's Curry for almost ten years now. The food has always been excellent and the service has improved and become very good over the past few years!We visited today for my brother's birthday and it was a wonderful experience; our waiter Narayanan went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant meal and checked in on us frequently. We enjoyed ourselves very much and commend Narayanan for his excellent service! We'll be dining here for decades to come :-
1
I was craving for fish head curry today and decided to try Muthu's Curry. Big mistake, fish head was mushy and not fresh at all. When one of your signature dishes is Fish Head Curry, I think it would not be unreasonable to expect your Fish Head to be fresh. Enough said. Skip Muthu's Curry and eat somewhere else
5
I wish to express my appreciation to the service staff attended to us, Ms Sara...
She was well mannered and dedicated with her services. We truly felt at home.
Palani

We had a very enjoyable evening at Race Course Road restaurant, friendly service from Narayanan who recommended lovely dishes :)
5
Very nice atmosphere with incredible food. Fish head curry was excellent, thank you to our server Sara for making the experience enjoyable.
5
I recommend Muthu's for a casual dining experience either a weekend lunch or dinner. The food is consistently good and reasonably priced. The masala prawns are my personal favourite (ask for extra gravy) but all of the other curries are good too.
3
Went there several times. It's an average South Indian restaurant, average prices and food quality, taste
4
We visited Muthus on recommendation. The food was not too bad. We had Chicken 65 and chilli crab. Pleasant environment. However was slow service. We cancelled one dish.
4
We had chicken, palak, fish cutlet amongst others. Good food with friendly service. Pleasant ambience.
2
Food was ok but not great. We had the fish head and it appeared that the fish was put in the sauce and not cooked in it as I was expecting. It was not fresh and was fishy.We ordered 1 rice and 1 roti. The rice comes with 2 vegetables. We were charged for 2 rice because there was 2 of us. I think if you charge me for 2 rice then I should get 4 vegetables or at least the server should let me know that even if you cannot eat the rice we will still charge for 2 rice because there are two of you
4
I had lunch with my boyfriend on Saturday. The restaurant was enjoying a very good and brisk business with locals and tourists filling up most of the tables available. The first staff we met was this solemn-looking young lady who also was the cashier. She pointed a table for us - no smiles, no greetings at all. We were given menus - again, there was no greetings. I began to feel that this restaurant is just interested to provide you food. Hell, even fast food restaurant staff are warmer than this. We ordered fish tikka, mutton briyani, deep-fried fish roe, and palaak paneer. The fish tikka is a MUST ORDER. It was cooked perfectly - the fish was not dry at all, and still retained its juiciness. The mutton briyani, however, was a bit dry. A little bit of gravy would help a lot. The palaak paneer was absolutely delicious and I would recommend for people to order it, even if one is not vegetarian. :)The food came in about 15 minutes' time. As the restaurant serves beers and alcohol, this is not a halal establishment, for Muslims who are very strict about this. The total bill for us came up to $53, which is mid-range when it comes to Indian food. I think that for a restaurant that is one of the country's most popular Indian restaurants, they should really buck up in their hospitality standards so that people can enjoy both the food and also be given a warm service like restaurants should. A little smile would not hurt. The owner should take their customers' reviews seriously as I am sure I am not the only one who is dissatisfied with the service standards here
1
We visited Muthu at Race Course Road to celebrate my son's birthday. This is not the first time we visited Muthu. The food was not too bad. However the waitress who took the order from us sounds hostile and show least respects for customers. Serving of vegetables that comes with the white rice has to be requested at least twice before she came to serve with black face. The service charges paid is definitely not worthed the services. We will unlikely to revisit Muthu again
5
One of the best curry experiences of my life. The Mutton Chukka is to DIE for, packed with tons of cloves and chilli. Great food, great staff, great ambiance.
4
Visited Muthu's Curry for lunch and ordered some dishes together with naan and basmati rice. Whilst the standard has been consistently good, the prices have increased noticeably. Portions have shrunk whilst prices have risen.
I would still visit in future, but probably less frequently.
5
Had a meal here on a Wednesday night, our waitress Sara was extremely helpful and made some great recommendations. The food was very tasty and great value, we will definitely be back
4
Always eat here with the family when i travel. Food was spicy but standard was consistent. Service needs to improve with quality. Disappointed that the Carrot Halva and Fish Roe was removed from the menu !
4
Visited here today during our visit to little India , we love a chettinad curry and this one did not disappoint , we also had the tikka masala which had a lovely smoky tandoori taste , the naan and veg samosa also spot on . Service was good , alcohol like everywhere else is expensive , wine at 14 dollars a glass and beer at12 dollars , meal totalled around 70 dollars 
5
what i like about this place is the space,Neat decor and ambiance.The best caring service, thanks to our lovely friend Mr. Visu, in combination with superb food and drinks to die for.I like the energy of the staff and the service too.I don't think to write a review, but still I would like to appreciate all the staffs for taking care of us very friendly.please don't miss the chance to visit muthus curr
5
I came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends and family. I am not surprised how pleasant the staffs are here as I am a regular customer. However, the staffs actually brought a dessert with candle and made my birthday even more special. Thanks Narayan and staffs for this. Wonderful food and service
4
Mr Pradeep, Miss Elamathi, Vinny and a few other staff of Muthu's curry will definitely make your visit to this Race Course Rd branch a very satisfying one. The food is one of the best Indian food I have eaten in Singapore. Try their mango lassi. It is the best I have tasted so far.Chicken 65, fried calamari and fried fish are a must for us. Only complaint is the prawns in the prawn masala are at times not fresh. However, the masala is top- notch. To finish off, their masala tea is to die for. There is a thick cardamon stick as stirrer. But what makes my family and I want to return to Muthu's Curry at Race Course Road? It is definitely the staff of Muthu's! Good job all. We will be back soon
3
The place is more nearer from the Farrer park MRT exit on race course road.We visited this place to try the signature fish curry. The curry has very delicious, they have an excellent option of providing only the curry for vegetarians like who are more keen to feast on the non meaty part. Also, the garlic onion mushroom appetizer was good. The regular fish curry size is more than enough for two or may be three people. The overall service is also pretty swift. Place was clean
2
We headed to Muthu's lunch to celebrate my parents anniversary on the second day of Chinese New Year. The restaurant is beautiful and has great ambience and deco. There were a lot of waiters but no one was coming forward to direct patrons to a table so some patrons just walked in and found their own seats. Indian Restaurants in general are known to be hospitable and generous in their serving. However our experience was nothing of that sort. The waiter didn’t mentioned that there was no gravy served for rice; we had to order them separately and that it was chargeable. They forgot to serve the hot water we requested and they had to be reminded to serve the two vegetables for our rice. The menu actually reads no sharing of white rice & biryani rice – Highly distasteful. I had a 3 year old with me and I should be able to share with her. We ordered 1 white rice and 2 Briyani rice. They served rice in a regular size bowl which was only half filled in comparison to most Indian Restaurants which fills to brim. They brought 1 bowl of white rice and another bowl of briyani rice. So we thought the other one will come later as we order 2 Briyani - 15 mins later when we asked them where is the other Biryani and the waiter said “That’s 2 Briyani portion in that 1 bowl". When we told him it was the same size bowl as the white rice and the portions was the same so how could that be two portion? The waiter refilled the Briyani. Ladies toilet was dirt
4
We had dinner here while in little India. Good curries. Fast service. The mutton vindaloo was superb. The aloo mutter great and the accompanied rice and naans made it filling and satisfying
4
We visited Muthus on recommendation and we were not disappointed, the food was authentic and flavoursome and the staff were efficient and helpful.
5
We had 2 great meals at this restaurant. The staff are very friendly. The restaurant is spacious, clean and comfortable. So many great dishes to choose from, it's hard to know where to start! Tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were a highlight as well as the freshly baked naan.
5
Our group of nine arrived in the midst of a midday downpour so we were all soaked. The staff helped us bag our umbrellas and dry out as best we could. We came for the fish head curry and we were not disappointed. It was fabulous as was all the other dishes we sampled. The beer and wine we used to wash it down was fairly priced. The sun even came out by the time we left
3
A friend who traveled to Singapore a lot recommended this place as "fabulous." It wasn't. We are not Indian, but enjoy eating Indian food. Muthu's would be an "average" Indian restaurant in NYC and below average in London. We were there Saturday night, and the place was half full. Tells you a lot. The naan basket was just so so
4
This place is mostly known for its fish head curry. However , We went down to try the rest of the menu instead. It was worth a visit with most dishes tasting well. If spicy non-veg is on your mind , give this place a shot !!
3
The fish head curry was above average. The mango lassi was great. The bread was average. The chicken in cashew nut sauce did not test of cashew nuts nor anything much, disappointing. The gulub jam / jamun dessert was okay. The coffee was good enough - (which is better than the average Indian restaurant in Singapore). Very civilised, with pleasing decor and clean toilets and surroundings. Neither exotic and expensive nor cheap and cheerful. A good standby. Anybody who has never had fish head curry was be pleasantly surprised. You can ask for your food not too spicy, or very spicy, which is good. In fact, the waiters take the trouble to ask you
3
Was really looking forward to the fish head curry, however, was very disappointed. Texture was soft and mushy and flavour somewhat offensive. Not sure if the fish was previously frozen or just low quality. There were minimal vegetables (lady fingers only) and the pineapple on top was under ripe. Not sure if we just got a bad batch or if that is what others enjoy, but I've had better fish head curry at a hawker center. Briyani rice also missed the mark. With so many other great Indian restaurants to chose from I cannot recommend this place. On the positive service was good and they do provide cabbage and brinjals with the meal.
4
We had two different varieties of fish curry. One was very spicy and one more mild. We each ordered rice to go with it. We started out with a combination appetizer that included 5 different items. Tiger beer was expensive at SG$11 but not unusual for Singapore. I should have only ordered 1 piece of fish because I was stuffed by the end. We did not need naan bread. We spent about SG$86 for 2 of which SG$33 was beer. The restaurant was clean and well air conditioned.
4
We come here often as a family of 2 adults and 2 small children (6 & 8) and we love the place. We like the banana leaf plates and the complimentary papadums and chutneys. The food is all delicious with a mix of old favourites as well as their specialty, Fish Head Curry. Service is always attentive. In the heart of Little India we enjoy the walk around from the MRT and back. Parking is a nightmare so use taxi or MRT!
4
Excellent fare served at a good ambience. Fish head curry a signature dish bring the best of the restaurant...
3
Food was alright, service average. our naan bread was dry and burned however the samosas and house wine was good. It was busy the night we went not sure if that's why we got average service as well.
4
The restaurant offers variety of Indian Food and serves draft beer to complete your meal with drink.
3
The Muthu at Little India is sort of insitution when it comes to curry in Singapore. Food remains good -though nothing special. Service was pathetic. The one waiter for our section had to be waved at to come by after we sat down for more than 5 minutes. The curry fish head came luke warm; we had the waiter to take it back to be reheated. We asked for water several times before it finally arrived. At the end, we had to go to cashier by the front entrance to ask for our bill when we had to point to the cashier which table we sat on. Not worth returning:(Note: Up the road, Banana Leaf was packed with people lining up as late as 9pm. Will try next time in Singapire
5
Muthu's Curry in Race course road is the most elegant and hygenic Indian place in Singapore. The waiters whether its Raghu, Visu etc are able to guide you on what to eat based on your likesFor a vegetarian, there is a lot more variety in terms of food choice from paneer dishes to vegetarian kabab to gobi manchurian to Hara Bara Kabab.For meat lovers, the chicken masala,Tangdi Kabab, the fish head curry is a must try. The fish head curry is mildly spicy compared to the other Indian chains and lot more thicker gravy.In the desert section have tried the Gulab Jamun which comes nice decoratedWas in a flight with a fellow foodie from Holland and one of his favourite place to eat in Singapore too is Muthu's CurryThe food in Muthu's curry is 30% more expensive than equivalent Indian joints in Race course road but the ambience, decor and experience make up for i
3
I have been here few times. Their pepper chicken and mutton mysore are pretty nice. Dined here recently with my family as my wife was craving for some fish curry and Rice. We ordered rice which usually comes with two sides, fishy curry, butter naan, butter paneer and two mocktails. The mocktails arrived first, followed by rice, fish curry and naan but the butter paneer took eons to arrive. Growing impatient after numerous reminders to serve the paneer, I finished the naan before it turned cold with one of the side that came with my wife's rice. I took away the paneer dish once I was done with my dinner. The mocktails too sweet and the food was pretty average and the service was poor.

This restaurant has been around for many years and expanded their wings as an accomplished F&B operators in recent years. They do have another posh branch in Dempsey (upscale area). However, the food I had in this restaurant 10 years ago was modest, nice and above all: unpretentious. These days, they turned their business module to more revenue driven and as a hotelier, I am definitely inclined for robust revenue. However restaurant business has everything to do with soul and therapy which will stay in people's taste pallet and heart. On that note, this restaurant is miserable! I am indeed surprised with their Trip Advisor ranking but ponder upon other travelers review here and I only can sum up to one conclusion. This restaurant has shifted its authentic way of preparing food to touristy flavor. Following is my exact review based on food that me and my friends/colleague consumed on a weekday evening at 7.00pm: SERVICENothing to shout about. No smile - no flair and most service staff is very much focused on serving and clearing. They could not be bothered to engage or explain certain type of food. Unless you bring the aura of a Caribbean tourist who is in Singapore to enjoy extended beach environment.FOOD QUALITYFrom the Dum Briyani to the masala tea - all seems very plain. Sincerely prepared with no love. We have a SriLankan crab that has been prepared in crap masala way. None of the masala has been simmered evenly so the Crab or the Briyani blends together. But I guess overseas people who rarely have Indian food might blow the trumpet for uneven masala cooking because it is spicy and freaking unhealthily hot! I am 100% sure the locals, irrelevant of Chinese, Malay or Indian will find this food total pretentious as well. Again you be the judge guys if you have any spare dollars!PRICE POINT One of the worst I have come across in this Red Dot Island! Restaurant located in the heart of Asia but they charge 1 white rice portion for $3.00++. 1 Kashmiri Naan without condiments at $5.00++. They are only charging slightly lower than Indian Restaurant operating at numerous top hotels in City. But the least, we can be sure to expect for a nice food in those places. The Briyani of $11.00++ comes in a kids portion. AMBIANCEThis is one area they truly score but what is Buckingham Palace excluding Queen! That would be the perfect description on this restaurant. All the best for this restaurant to ride past any difficult economy climate as I belief tourist influx is low and locals must have already decided to try plenty of other better restaurants in the same area.Thank you folk
4
Great value in a clean but low budget set up. Lots of Indian people eating in here which well and truly gives it the seal if approval. Be careful of the spices, as they aren't damped down to European tastes! Spicy!!! But great food and good prices for Singapore
5
Brought my brother n his family who live in the UK. They loved the food and ambience here. Once again Narayan service was excellent. He took care of everyone's needs with patience and a smile. A place to recommend for ppl who are craving for Indian food
4
We arrived after a long 20 hour journey from Britain. We eat Indian food alot and enjoy home cooking found menu good we prob ordered too much as unaware the portion sizes. We were served by Visu who we found to be very attentive and good fun and helpful, a credit Muthu's. A excellent meal. Thank you.
5
Came with my family again for dinner. Even though it was a busy Saturday the staffs never fail to invite and serve us with a smile. Especially Narayan was very attentive to us. Thank you so much Narayan for your excellent service.
4
Went for Dinner with friends and business colleagues from India and Japan for a celebration dinner. Very hospitable and food to die for!!
5
Another required Singapore dining experience: fish head curry in Little India. Very spicy, very delicious.
4
Great place for good Indian Food. The South Indian flavour is excellent and restaurant is known for its famous Fish Head curry. It is Spicy but tasty. Their Chicken Tikka was good, but Sheek kebab's were disappointing. Their Naan's and dessert were nothing great. Had a feeling that their Chef does a very good job with South Indian dishes but for North Indian dishes they are average
4
Went to this place after many people recommended that Muthu's is a must visit....so went to their main outlet at Little India....i must say it was quite impressive.....ordered their special and renowned Fish Head Curry and also chilli prawns, steamed rice, 2 types of vegetables and beers....loved every bit of it...one note of caution...the place shuts down at 10pm...so be there before that if you dont want to be dissapointed...the best part of this place, that unlike most places in Singapore this place serves awesome food at very reasonable price...otherwise, at all other places we ate in Singapore including road side restaurants was quite delicious but very expensive.,.,.

For us the Holy Grail of Indian cuisine is to find a restaurant which combines the qualities of great tandoori cooking with top notch curries. So rarely do we find the two together that a satisfactory performance from one half of the kitchen will keep us happy if the other half excels. At Muthu's Curry, however, neither are up to scratch.To be fair to the tandoori chef, it would seem his skills are excellent... everything was cooked beautifully, the marinades were excellent, and indeed the broccoli tikka was the best dish of the meal. But the chicken tikkas were ruined simply because the quality of the chicken was third rate.Now this was a surprise we did not expect, having been very careful to ask the waiter whether the 'boneless chicken' was breast or not. 'Chicken breast' was the confident and unambiguous answer. When we pointed out that BOTH our tikkas were not only NOT breast, but very poor quality meat at that, he said 'It is boneless chicken. We do not distinguish between breast meat and the rest'. Unforgiveable in my opinion. And for this single reason the tikkas were transformed from aspiring to the heights to a rank poor.However, the curry course was a travesty. The prawn curry consisted of tasteless prawns adorned with a hot but one-dimensional chinese style sauce, and the 'flower' crab was swamped in a wholly inappropriate curry sauce which would have probably been best matched to lamb, and the crab itself was all shell and no meat.Given that the waiter forgot several of our requests (as well as that the chicken was not breast meat), we were left with little positive to take away from our experience
2
I asked the uninterested waiter if the chicken tikka was breast meat, he said yes, so we ordered it. When it arrived (2 portions), we discovered it wasn't, and when I told him it wasn't, he said he meant that it came in a homogenous block called 'chicken'. I didn't get any form of apology until we left, after I had shown my displeasure throughout the meal. The flower crab dish we had was tiny, and tasted strange, not of crab, and had no signs of anything fresh like garlic or ginger. The prawn curry was a Chinese stir fry, and we had to ask 3 times for salt. Finally they put 17 per cent onto the bill. Don't believe the good reviews, just avoid it
5
This is a clean, open and friendly restaurant with open kitchen, air con and comfortable seating.When there as for Sara an extremely friendly and helpful waitress. The quality of the food was good and the pricing very reasonable. The mysore Dried Mutton was nicely spicy,the Butter chicken well spiced and flavorsome. Particularly interesting was the deep fried cauliflower, Gobi Machin. Sweets were Carrot Hlwa and Kulfi, an excellent choice.They serve Kingfisher beer in ice cold glasses.Don't forget to try the butter Roti and Naan.We spend a lot of time in Singapore and this is one of the best.EnjoyDaryl74

We read about the place on trip advisor and reached there. The place is very crowded with at least 20 minutes wait time, however must say there is room for improvement in crowd management. Now for the good part the food which is awesome. We tried the Flower crab which was fresh, spicy and just done well. Also the palak dal was nice. The staff is attentive and warm. We would like to give special mention to Sara who served us. Keep it up guys, we will return...
4
Lunch was an excellent Chicken tika, fabulous Malabar fish curry and tasty, but still had bones in, Chicken 65. One staff member was a little disinterested and we got a very good garlic nan rather than Paalak Daal, which arrived later and was good. Other staff members were good. All in all, a very tasty lunch in pleasant, clean surroundings
4
great food at even better prices. Ambiance is normal, not fine dining. the spicy dry mutton is a must try. all theoir food tastes fresh and if you find it spicy down it with chilled beer.
5
Love eating at Muthu's Curry. Alway comfortable and reliable. Generous with the vegetable servings of cabbage and egg plant. We always order chicken masala. The fried fish is good too. Service is friendly and good.
4
As a Singaporean, we are blessed with food from the different ethnic groups. Muthu's curry is somewhere that I had eaten since young. Now it is a bit more commercialised but still as authentic.
3
Used to be super duper good. Perhaps after being taught down generations, taste changed and it's not as good anymore. Used to be the WOW. Now is like meh...
5
Went there after a long time. Years ago, this was a small joint in a peaceful road off Serangoon Road, not known to many. But famed for fish head curry. Everything has changed. This is a busy road now- you can as well call it Restaurnat Row. This is the star of them all. Much bigger, a lot of customers, all enjoying themselves. Bif variety of food. But very noisy. I and my friend had a lot to talk , and we found it difficult because of the ambient noise. But the food ! The fish head curry was great. More than adequate for two persons. Spicy, with the marinade almost making your eyes stream, and the fish still standing out. We had some draught beer yo go with this, and an omletter which was a contrast tot he curry. All in- great food. great location, and very good service. What more to ask 
5
Muthu’s Curry is a restaurant you would love to hate: It’s always in the limelight and a large majority of its customers are tourists. The immediate instinct for any discerning foodie is to stay away, because the flavours must be gentrified, the kitchen must be holding back on the spices to cater to the tourist palate, and being so popular, the crew must be getting contented. It is a great traditional Indian food experience, the fish head curry here remains one of the top in Singapore. The service is incredible and of course the food is extraordinary, The staff is friendly and swift, A great place if you’re looking for traditional Indian food with a bit of spice. Muthu's Curry has branches in Suntec City and Dempsey, but we feel that the original outlet at Race Course Road has better all-round flavours
5
Muthu's isn't fancy fine dining, but it's tasty fresh Indian comfort food that hits the right spots for not very much money. Service is always good. If you're not happy with anything just let the waiters know and they'll do their best to help you out. Gets crowded on weekends but food still arrives fast and hot. I love their fried fish with a serve of fish curry on the side

We visited Curry Muthu for the second time this year in September. Their food is very nice and not too spicy, even for foreigners. Very much liked the way that food is served on leaves, and you can get more sauces if you like. My preference is more for chicken than for mutton, but our friends like the mutton very much as well
4
been hearing a lot about this place and was initially very skeptical. but when i came and ordered the popular dishes, i immediately went back into time and slapped my past self for being stupid not to visit this restaurant earlier in my life. though, the same thing might happen if i tried it earlier, the me at that point would just slap a younger me. its a never ending paradox.the fried fish roe was on point and actually ordered an extra portion to prevent a civil war within the family table. fish head curry had a really deep taste, each mouthful of curry was a history lesson on the origins of muthu's curry in Singapore
5
Nothing much can be added to so many detailed reviews that have already been shared. This is truly an iconic place for Indian food and South Indian curry in Singapore. No exaggeration- this is a torchbearer in every sense of the word- the signature FISH HEAD Curry is great and comes in HUGE quantity. The other variety of food, dessert and such an efficient, humble and courteous place would make you come back for more. A must try if you are visiting Singapore (almost 50% of the visitors are non Indians!), and if you are staying in Singapore it is one of the safest bets week in week out. A big Thumbs Up!

Had the fish head curry for lunch. Gravy was thick but not what I would like in fish curry. Had a strange bitter taste too. Lime juice was good though... Definitely different from the Muthu's of yesteryear. Has lost its "kick".
5
very special in indian cuisines.well cooked with the taste of spicy,the buffet was awesome,the service was wonderfull,a bit crowed but still enjoying the food, a lot of dishes and well cooked by the chefs,keep it up

food: average
atmosphere: average (noidsy)
service: above average
price: above average
basically, i love indian food (northern, southern etc) thus i expect more from muthu's curry.
my personal verdict: just one of the many indian restaurant, nothing fantastic...
4
The food was well prepared and decent (not outstanding) in flavor. Prices are good and the aircon is good. I've eaten here several times over the years and the food is consistently good
3
This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore. Recently went there with another couple. Everything I liked about this place changed. The menu was changed and limited , prices went up and quality went down. Nothing I ordered was as good as my previous visits. This went from a 10 rating to Average at very best. Not sure what happened here but I will not be going back. I think you could pick any place on race Course Road at random and do better
5
As an Indian food lover, I frequently been there for lunch.One of my favorite ever from Muthu is Curry Fish Head which is superb and also chicken Marsala.Best is to go with Dhal Curry and finish with Lassi ( Yogurt ).I been to 2 of their branch, race course road and sun tec city both offer delicious Indian food
4
Try anything on the menu, not just the house speciality, Fish Head Curry, to enjoy great flavours and quality food. Unfortunately when we went this time the place was full so we needed to wait for a table, but once again the wait was worthwhile.Staff are always friendly and efficient. One of my favourite places to eat in Singapore
5
Starve yourself a bit because once you manage to get thru the early evening crowds and find a table, you might just order everything on the menu. The main dish of the night is the fabulous Curry Fish Head, which will be inhaled - cheeks, eyes and all the nice fleshy bits in the head. The surprisingly fanged fish mouth bones, can be shaken at startled caucasian friends who aren't used to the delights of a eating fish head.Pair that lovely spicy dish with contrasty vegetable dishes and you will have a hard time walking afterwards. Egads, I want to bite my laptop right now just thinking of their delicious food! A tad pricy but very much worth it for as many times you can show up at the place and eat everything. Try the various lassi as cooling drinks also. This being an indian restaurant, the strong spice smell does cling to clothes a bit so do not wear fancy clothing to dine here, this is a family friendly restaurant, with slightly harried waiters specially at peak hour
4
An excellent quality restaurant specialising in Singapore-style Indian food. We went for the fish head curry and were not disappointed. The vegetable served were also delicious and plentiful. It was a little pricey S$60 for 2 without drinks but we had a huge dinner and were very impressed. Will definitely visit again on our next visit to Singapore
4
This restaurant is featured in the New York Times not for nothing. It is still one of the restaurants to patronise for Indian food in Singapore. Ingredients are fresh and dishes are cooked with a balance of flavour and spiciness although I think it may a bit too spicy for some.Although they have other branches in Singapore, I still prefer to visit their main outlet along Race Course Road in Little India which just adds to the atmosphere
5
Visited this restaurant after reading reviews about the Fish Head Curry and it did not disappoint. Perfect blend of spiciness and flavor and absolutely delicious with the steamed rice.
4
Its a big chain of restaurants all over Singapore. We tried the one at Little India and Dempsey Hill. Both are good and its a good restaurant for Indian food. Loads of foreigners in for a curry.
A safe bet.
5
We ordered fish head curry to enjoy with a selection of mutton, chicken, prawn and vegetables dishes.
Favourite was buttered chicken.
4
 We read about this restaurant in Time Out Singapore and decided to try out on our stopover in Singapore. Clean, airy and large restaurant on Race Course Road with excellent customer service. We chose Malabar Fish Curry, which was delicious and a dry styled curry, Muthu's Chicken Curry, which was spiced with hot chillies together with naan breads, poppadoms and accompaniments. The waitress also suggested we try a small onion dish which was gratis and was perfect with our dinner. Drinks are quite expensive
5
Whenever I go to Singapore, this place is one of the go to places. The food from this restaurant has changed my whole outlook on indian food. Befire I went to this restaurant, I thought great authentic Indian food from an Indian restaurant never existed. However I was wrong. The Indian food from this restaurant has been unbeatable for years. The fish head curry and the prawn curry is filled with so much flavour and is legitimately "Indian spicy". I literally think of this place as a sole reason to visit Singapore. The service is also unbeatable where the waiters give 100% effort in what they do. If you not only want to try authentic Indian food but delicious authentic Indian food, then this is the place. I literally believe that this restaurant has the best Indian food in the southern hemisphere.
5
The food at muthus curry is really nice tho I will visit frequently my favourites will always remember guy called vinay , he always serves very well we like the lamb chops with pineapple very well they cook even we do take takeaway of lamb chips for us but the price only bit over priced we fee
5
Am not a fan of fish but after tasting this curry here i came back for more. The curry was so good and one can eat the rice just with the curry sauce. Definitely a must try even if you are not a fish fan. The Malabar fish curry was also very good. Staffs were friendly and courteous, A little pricey but worth every penn
5
The fish head curry was heaven in a bowl! Real soul food made with love, an incredible culinary experience. I loved every bite. Experience this dish with an ice cold Kingfisher and naan bread to soak up all the gravy. Perfection!My server, Sara, was phenomenal, made great recommendations and was fantastic in every aspect

If you are visiting Singapore you have to try the Fish Head Curry and Muthu's Curry on Race Course Road should certainly be on your list of locations to try. A convenient 2 block walk from the Little India MRT stop the restaurant is easy to get to and to find. There's a full menu and the kebobs and nan looked great but you have to try the Fish Head Curry. Don't let the name scare you off. There's a very generous portion of fish, including the head, in an aromatic and wonderfully flavored, spicy, curry. Fresh okra and pineapple add to the textures and flavors. Even if you can't bring yourself to tackle the head, the meat is so very soft, there's plenty of food for two in a single serving. Our server, Ramesh, recommended simple white rice and it was an excellent suggestion. The curry is so flavorful that mixing it with the good biryani detracted from the flavor. The simple white rice and curry were a spectacular combination. Make sure you don't miss it, it will be a meal you remember from your visit to Singapore
4
Had a very nice lunch here. Food was excellent, and the service was good too, even with a full restaurant. Reminded me of India - As others have said, food is spicy for Europeans, but just the way I like it. Tried the watermelon juice which was nice to cool down. Don't miss this place in Little India, short walk from the Farrer Park MRT
5
Loved our first visit here, which we made with some great friends. The fish head curry here is exceptional (bring a handkerchief or towel with you - I found it deliciously spicy) and I also enjoyed the mango ice-cream dessert. Wonderful ambience.
4
A famous place for rich Indian cuisine. Great variety and value on menu. Restaurant features a bar with wines, is spacious for various occasions and has comfortable seating. Food was delish!
5
Feeling for curry fish head we decided on Muthu's Curry at Race Course Road. And it proved to be a excellent choice. The place is very stylish. And the seafood was very fresh. And it was service with a smile.
4
Muthus really serves the best Indian Fish Head Curry in Singapore!!! Clean and very nice for a family visit it serves some exceptional Indian food if you are in the mood for some kurries and kebabs! Must visit on your next Sing Sing visit....
4
We went to Little India in Singapore for some Indian Food. Muthu's Curry is near a MRT Station and you can sit outside or inside. The Food was delicious and the staff was friendly. Try the Masala Curry with Nan bread!
3
I like muthu's curry at little India area. Patronized the restaurant a number of times and liked that they did a renovation some time back. Food was good but not fantastic. A good gathering spot for family. My favorite restaurant after D'Bell Restro Lounge at north canal road (though both are different in many aspects)
1
Food variety - wide range of choices to choose from.Food taste - niceService - worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant. The waitress who took my order didn't smile at all. Even worse, she gave me an unhappy expression on her face after I have completed naming my order. As thought I did not meet the minimum required items to order by each diner. It took ages for them to deliver some pre-prepared items. I am not referring to a-la minute dishes. I am referring to items such as gravy, rice, side dishes as complement to the rice.Overall experience - you judge for yourself. With bad service, do you still going to enjoy your food? Not forgetting, for the price we are paying, we are expecting good service
1
Terrible service. I felt they look us down cuz to get a something from service staff I had to requset more than 3 times. Also I ordered beer and they gave me when I finished food almost, even though I asked them to give me a beer first. Of course, if they are busy. I can understand. But they were very free. Only 3 table of customer was there. They treated us like a homeless. Never smile and ignore. Taste of food??? Fish head curry?? At least, if food were nice, I wouldn't leave this comment. Food has just normal taste. Nothing special and more expensive than its value.I recommend you do not visit here.
4
The food is always excellent! As a regular customer, we noticed that the menu has changed.. It's now on one piece of paper, front and back. Very classy! However, the food hasn't changed at all.. Still the same ol'taste. Delicious! Today we had the fish curry, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and some naans. The fish curry: the fish was fresh! A little bit on the spicy sideButter chicken: it's a must food for us, we love to dip the naan in the butter curry. Delicious!Chicken tikka masala: a second favorite!
4
Been here a few times over the years with repeated friends and visitors. To help you understand and decide, here is my assessment: Ambience = 4/5 - it's simple but as you eat on banana leaves and have veggies served in the house. It's different from you Italian restaurant :-)Food = 4/5 - good food. Nearly all options were nice. Fish head curry was worth the experience. Once every visit non of my guests had issues. All good however not yet great that is, did not wow me to come back. We just end up here. Again. Service = 3/5 - it's will never be good or excellent. I accept. So just get a servers attention. Ask what you want and ask again and it will all get sorted. These guys are not trained to have fake smiles but they got the job done. So far achieve the service I needed. Overall. It rounds up to a 4. And that's okay. It's definitely above the average venue. Price wise it's not expensive in my view.
4
Great food. Good service. Be aware of the spices though. Medium spicy as described by the waiter is well beyond the limits of most europeans. Good atmosphere.
4
Muthu's is just down the road from Banana Leaf. Restaurant is modern and clean. Food is tasty but a bit too spicy, as I asked for mild. My husband likes super hot food and he loved the food. Good value for money.
4
Great place to get Indian food on a banana leaf. Take the purple line MRT to Farrer Park, exit at Race Course Road, walk about 100m and you will see Muthu's curry on the left.
5
I know Indian food in Australia is pretty good, but you have to try Muthu's Curry in Singapore - they have a number of restaurants and I have always had a great meal.
4
Quieter side of Little India (on race course road). Spacious with good and clean environment. Tasty food, faster service. Good both for leisure and business dining.
4
The food, the service, the atmosphere, everything top, even the price is not too bad!
It is certainly not the first time that we were there and certainly will not be the last,
5
The food at muthus is so delicious! when my family and i lived in singapore we would visit muthus at least once a week! we always order, and then as a side ask for the chicken or fish curry sauce, to pour over rice because the curry sauce is so irresistible! everything is perfect in muthus from the service to the food to the atmosphere! the muthus in dempsey hill is also very good, but id say ths muthus is the best one out of all the muthus curry in singapore
3
Had a good curry in a more upscale setting. You still have your rice served on a good old banana leaf except that is symmetrically cut to fit the tray that its placed on. Curries were a little less fiery than other places and perhaps mellowed down to suit the more touristy palettes.

After watching a Singapore documentary on traditional local food showing how Muthu cooks his special fish head curry gravy for hours, surprisingly my 12-year son wanted to try it! (1) The signature fish head was fresh and the curry thick. Ocra (brinjal) portions were generous too. The Indian spice taste is not too strong so this goes down well with non-Indian patrons. More than half the patrons were non-Indian. (2) chicken masala - this is good. Flavor is quite unique and different from other masala we have tried. We finished all the gravy! (3) cashew chicken - this was the only True non spicy food we had. We Thot the nuts would come as whole nuts but they were ground to a paste. Very fragrant and unique dish! (4) Naan - butter naan was good. Cheese naan - not much cheesy taste :( (5) We were pleasantly surprised that they served us complimentary papadum and 2 side dishes of cauliflower and curried brinjal. DO NOTE : the servers , while helpful, have a different standard on "spiciness" than non-Indians. They told is the brinjal side dish was not v spicy and suitable for kids but my 7yr old's mouth "went up in flames" shouting I'm on fire!! Lol! Thankfully their lemon tea quenched his fire! Similarly they told us the chicken masala is Non spicy but it IS spicy! Not very but still not suitable for young kids. TIP #1 don't feel shy about going to the centre to see how the chefs cook the naan. So intriguing to see them slap the naan in the Humongous pot and skewer the kebabs. TIP#2 do go early or make a reservation. At 6.30pm the servers were able to come to us v quickly. By 7pm the place was full house on a Thu night! Had to wait a while before getting a server's attention. Drinks wise - lassi and iced lemon teas are great for quenching thirst tho the serving is small and I needed 2 glasses! TIP #3 take mrt to Farrer Park station and walking there is only 5 min away. In all, if you want a more classy Indian place with nice ambience , Muthu's is a good place to go to. If you want buffet, I sugg Shahi Maharani lunch buffet. sometimes they have 1 for 1 offers.

last week we went there with my family members.last year also we visited here.the new ambience and the interior was excellent.felt like homely food.service was excellent. Mr. Visu invited and served us with smile.he has recommended many varieties.we have tasted evrythg. everything was excellent.overall we came out of here with full satisfaction
3
Came recommended but sadly not quite what we expected. We were lead to a corner served then ignored. Food was ok but not worth writing home about. Restaurant wasn't very busy. Toilets not nice. Wouldn't rush back.
4
I went here with my team.
The fish head curry is definitely recommended, portion is quite big and serves 5 people.
The fried ladies fingers are excellent food.
They have north Indian food also but its pretty average, go for the south indian delicacies.
5
Really friendly staff, tasty food and value for money in an unexpected location. If you want to try an authentic meal in Little India, Singapore, would highly recommend. Attention to hygiene, service and requests were spot on.
5
Another top-notch Indian restaurant off Race Course Road, in an area known as Little India. These are southern Indian chefs. I usually bring my business associates here for vegetarian cuisine. Each item except for pappadumn is freshly cooked the moment an order is made. During lunch crowd the air-cons can be worked really heavy. Do not expect the toilets, tables and floor to be fully cleaned. They are very short of service staff. Try the freshly-squeezed lime juice or coconut drink ! Å”efreshing especially on a warm day. Tip: Call in advance to reserve a nice table
4
We found this restaurant in our tour book and decided to try on our 1st nite. Place was really busy and looked nice. Got a lovely table by the window. Service was a bit slow and had to ask for drinks a few times.Plenty of options for me as a vegetarian though food was really too spicy for me to enjoy. Was a bit disappointing it being too spicy. The portions were large and was nice no plates and food being served on the banana leafs. Enjoyed a few Indian beers and some mango lassi's which unfortunately didn't cool my throat. Food was reasonable priced
4
Met up with friends for a good banana leaf dinner. A very presentable and comfortable restaurant. The fish head curry was excellent and had just the right balance of spiciness and sourness that gives it its unique flavour. The mutton chukka and black squids were cooked really well. We really enjoyed our meal and it was at a reasonable cost. Also, make sure you order the lime juice!!! Only complaint is that the service was a little slow with the rice and pappadums even though the restaurant was not busy
4
Came here for a family dinner. A huge selection of dishes, we were spoilt for choice and everything including the fish curry (which is very difficult to perfect) was delicious. Only thing though - some dishes were actually pretty spicy for my taste, but would probably be alright for those who enjoy spicy food. Could just be me but it's worth a try!
4
we lunched here with a group of business associates and were not disappointed. I enjoyed being able to choose from pre-prepared food as well as from the menu as you had a better idea of what we were getting and wanted to share several dishes. The staff member was very helpful with his recommendations. One of the best Indian meals I have had. Eating off banana leaves instead of plates added a nice touch to the feral experience. Well priced also
4
Enjoyed the pepper prawns and mutton vindaloo. This place was recommended by a colleague and was an excellent lunch after a visit to Little India and Mustafa Centre which are both just down the road.Meal was served onto trays with banana leaf and took no real time at all to arrive

The signature South Indian style Curry Fish head ($22/$27/$32) that has secured numerous accolades differed from the Chinese fish head curry in many ways. The colour was intense red instead of yellowish. According to the Folks, this kind of curry uses less coconut milk, so it was less creamy but the gravy is still rich because of the heavy spices rather than curry powder. There were no sight of brinjals, cabbage or tomatoes but ladyfingers and the piquant pineapple slices. Those who are adverse to spicy food will be able to handle this pot easily as the curry is NOT spicy at all. No sweat. We all love the gravy and could ladle it non-stop onto the fragrant Dum Bryani ($4/head) or white rice ($3/head), though the fish was not too fresh that day. If the menu looks Greek to those who seldom have Indian food, there is also display counter where one can pick whatever food that looks tantalizing. The Mysore mutton ($11) was too tough but the Tandoori Chicken (below), chicken marinated in yoghurt, was smoky and flavorful. For full review, visit user's blog under profil

This was my first visit to Muthu's Curry and it was very good! (My brother lives in Singapore and had been there many times.) We ordered 2 chicken dishes, Biryani rice and naan. Everything was great and I loved their mint sauce.
4
A nice restuarant. Nothing exceptional in terms of ambience but the food was extremely good. Recommended for all food lovers. Do try out their fish head curry :)
4
Restaurant is located in little India and quite large compared to the others around there. The service was quick and friendly. All the dishes we had were delicious and due to this ate far too much but just couldn't stop. This is a place you can't skip if you love indian food. Price/quality is good
5
I was in Singapore about 8 years ago. After having the obligatory Singapore Sling at the Long Bar at Raffles, I asked an employee there for his recommendation of where to eat in Little India. This time I did the same, and his answer was Muthu's Curry. Our thanks to this gentleman: the food was delicious, and the service outstanding. One of us is a vegetarian and there were ample choices for both of us. And for the price of a drink at Raffles (S$30+ with service and tax!) you get a full dinner
5
I am a lover of spicy south/north Indian food and usually need my fill of it every week. I have sampled many versions of Fish Head curry and I must say this is one of the best. The curry was thick and spicy, fish was fresh, tender and meaty. The rice set came with 2 side vegetables which was cabbage with lentils and spicy eggplant which was fantastic. I had a side order of mutton mysore which was tender, mouth watering and filled with flavour. I especially liked how everyone helped themselves to a free flow of water and papadums. Unlike, most establishments that charge for water or only serve mineral water at a hefty price.To top it off the staff over at the Suntec branch is really nice and friendly. Raja our service assistance was attentive and was good with the kids. Prices are reasonable for a restaurant setting which is cool and comfortable. If you like a bit of scenery while you dine, pick a table outside as the there is beautiful view of the fountain of wealth 
4
So many years in Singapore but I never visited this gem, it is indeed a very nice place to eat.Service is quick and staff is keen to cater its customers. Food is just right and full value for every single $ you spend.Worth it, a must try
4
A far cry from the Muthu's Curry Restaurant of the past, the swanky Muthu's both at Dempsey Road and Race Course Road has ambience, great food and attentive servers. My favourites are the Masala Chicken - succulent pieces of chicken in thick aromatic masala gravy, Mysore Mutton - falvourful pieces of fried mutton and Crab Meat Varuval - crab meat pan fried with lots of aromatic curry leaves. Try also their Masala Tea which is one of the best I've tasted
5
This was our third dinner we enjoyed at Muthu's - as excellent as ever. We have been to Indian restaurants around the world and whilst we had more elegant places - Muthus clearly serves the most authentic, tasty, best food. The atmosphere is not festive nor elegant - so if you are looking for this go to Rang Mahal at the Pan Pacific Hotel. But for a simple evening with great food and a pint of beer, or a fresh fruit juice like my wife had, this is the place to go. Excellent value for money I might add - we had Chicken Tikka, Chicken Masala, Broccoli Tandoori, Garlic Naan, one pint of beer and one water melon juice came to a little over Sing.$ 60.- The clientele is very mixed, but the most positive sign that food is good, are the many Indians dining there. They have two branches on the Race course road and one at Dempsey compound. We shall return

Heard about the fish-head curry, and several reviews recommended this place. Since we were already near Little India, we decided to give it a try. It's only a 5-minute walk from Little India station.The place was nearly empty when we arrived, at around noon on a Sunday. Having snacked in Little India markets, we weren't terribly hungry. So in addition to order the fish-head curry dish, we also ordered a squid dish, and rice. The waiter couldn't have seemed less interested in serving us. No smiles, no attempt to fill our water glasses until we flagged them down.The squid dish was a tiny dish, more of an appetizer sized dish. The fish head dish is very spicy, if you aren't used to Indian curry. My wife likes fish heads, so she delved into the head right away. She thought it was pretty good. I go more for the meat of the fish, and the meat was a bit tough, and not all that tasty without soaking the meat in the curry sauce.Overall, a bit of a disappointment. On top of that, a service charge is automatically added. No wonder the waiters don't seem to care..

Muthu's is down the road from The Banana Leaf Apolo. The two founders are said to be brothers but the food couldn't have been more different. Muthu's had "dumbed" up. But fancy menus and a non-Indian ambience won't make up for food that is going downhill. Perhaps I was using Apolo as a benchmark but simple fare like naan and rice weren't even properly cooked. The rice was in clumps and the naan didn't rise. The masala chicken was sweet and an absolute disaster
