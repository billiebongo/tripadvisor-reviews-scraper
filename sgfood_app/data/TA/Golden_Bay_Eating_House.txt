Just a few steps behind Boat Quay - no tourists, much better food and much lower price. The food is great, we have tried out almost everything, chilicrab, different variation of prawns, noodles etc - its al delicious. Price is at least half of what you pay down at Boat Quay. Try it, I am sure you won't be dissapointed
