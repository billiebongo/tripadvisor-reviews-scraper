Best Sunday roast in the East - beef, lamb or chicken - and very cold beer. Friendly atmosphere and lovely staff. Steak nights on Monday.

Nice little pub. Attracts mostly expats living in the area. Live sport on 4 screens and good selection of drinks/food. Surprisingly they have a very decent Sunday Roast offer.

Cool what for drinks with friends, football or general socializing. They have themed nights weekly and the food is really good. The staff are friendly and deeply engaging, and treat you like social. Great little boozer!!

Excellent Roast. Nice service. Great place for a Sunday lunch. Nice for weekday after work drinks also.

Not a bad place, pity that some of the expat clients are slightly on the loud side of being in a comfortable pub........

Was looking for a place close by for an early dinner and found this place within walking distance. Ordered the chicken masala with bread and the beer battered fish and chips. Both were awesome! The bread was done just right; crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The masala was done with just the right spiciness though Mum found it al little too hot for her taste. The beer battered fish was simply lovely. Loved the crispy batter which lasted till the very last mouthful. Great place though menu is limited. Will definitely visit again.

The Dog and Bone Pub has been about for many years, and I used to frequent it often when I lived nearer to it. I was early for an appointment nearby so stopped by at Dog and Bone for some refreshments last week. Nice friendly expat bar. Nice air conditioning. Great place to stop awhile - recommend

Admittedly they explained the chef just had a large order and we may have to wait a bit. We asked for water with no ice...and received iced water. We were asked which sauce we'd like mustard, horseradish or mint. We asked for mustard and horseradish...we received MINT. We both ordered roast beef and although the girl wrote it down when we ordered, she told the chef who brought it out that it should be one beef one lamb. (Not true). The server was friendly enough just didn't really remember anything we discussed when she asked. The dessert Bread & Butter Pudding looked like commercially packaged yuck topped with very cheap vanilla ice-cream

Food was well below what should be served for to humans even in a bar setting. Disappointed overall but the service staff were pleasant and good

It's strange that we had never visiting Dog& Bone in spite of staying a stone's throw away from the place. We had a couple of Gin Tonics and shared a mussel marinara that came with a basket of nicely toasted bread. The staff was attentive and we left very satisfied. If you want a tip, it's to ask to be seated in the air-conditioned indoor place. It get really hot outside inspite of the fans. But I guess if it's raining, it could be very pleasant outside. And oh, I heard their Sunday roast is pretty good

My wife, 2 adult sons and I had the privilege of dropping by at the Dog and Bone last Thursday night as soon as we arrived in Singapore for the HSBC rugby 7's. It was on upper East coast road a stone's throw away from we were staying. The initial welcome by Alex ( the owner), Mel and Janet behind the bar was awesome and they made us feel comfortable from the time we 'happened' to walk in. Those patronizing the bar were truly amazing and welcomed us with open arms. Each day we were in SIN we found time to drop and enjoy the very affordable drinks (unlike at the 7's where a small cup of beer cost 10 Sin dollars), and great pub food. Everyone was so friendly and were seen enjoying themselves despite 'intense rivalries' in the teams they support from the EPL, to the rugby and F1

Just met here with friends and I am super surprised how family friendly it is. There is a band playing right now and front seats are set up for the kids to listen. Beer prices are ok and did is delicious. Definitely a bug thumbs up! People are being treated very friendly. Keep doing such good business @owners

We have eaten a Sunday roast here twice now and there have been clear plates all round both times! The place has a great pub feel to it which I haven't found many other places in Singapore. It is family friendly and our kids love eating a small version of the all day breakfast whilst we tackle our roasts with lovely gravy and yorkshire puddings. The roasts do have mashed potato as well as roast potato which may offend some purists but I quite like it. I also especially appreciate the fact they have booster seats which tie to the chairs as it means that the high tables are not a problem unlike other places we have been

This is supposed to be a bit like an English type Pub would be.It has big tv screens and a good selection of drinks.We had the Sunday Lunch.If you're expecting a proper English Roast you will be disappointed!The meat was good but they can't make yorky puds for toffee!!It was not great but not bad.My other half comes in here regular but usually for a few pints with the lads.The service we received was good as it was quiet.Personally I would rather make my own roast dinner.I can't say what the other food is like as we haven't tried anything else off the menu.If you are looking for somewhere to watch footy and a pint then this will be up your street

Stayed in Singapore for nearly six weeks and visited D&B many times. Staff are great and always friendly, there's usually a really good crowd who are very sociable, a good selection of beers, and the food is also good. In particular i recommend the Sunday Roast - very good food and good value for money

I have been a regular at the Dog and Bone for the past 8 years. The atmosphere has always been great and the food has gone from strength to strength. Whether you want a roast on a Sunday or Steak and Pint for 20 dollars on a Monday it is all great value and great taste. The couple of negative reviews in this feed completely miss the point and am surprised to read feedback like that
