I visit this restaurant regularly. Value for money. Causal and simple restaurant with wide selection of sake though at very reasonable price. Manager Alan Lim is friendly & knowledgeable on sake. Sashimi is at supermarket price.

Reasonably priced sashimi.The exotic seasonal sashimi I included in my order would be- Cod fish sperm (shirako)- Monkfish liver (ankimo)The ankimo is listed on Wikipedia & CNN Go 2011 as the 32nd most delicious food in the world, & the preparation of this dish at Sakuraya Anchorpoint lives up to its reputation.Only a tad disappointed that the octopus is fresh but not at its freshest.Overall, a very good option for a sashimi stop

It is my first time putting a review in Tripadvisor and not the first time going to Sakuraya!Everytime that we have beem there, we loved it for the really fresh food, fast service and great value for trhe money.My family enjoy selecting the fish and hetting the drinks from the fridges, going back to the table and receiving your selected fish in only a few minutes.I also like that you can earn points through the Fraser's loyalty program

The most interesting thing is that you can chose the fish you like and see it condition before it become a sashimi or cooked. Food is good but my sashimi fish got injured so have blood clot which affect the taste. Cook food is great and delicious but very small serving.Staff: need to wait for a while to get their attention. But will serve you with a smileEnvironment: a very normal restaurant (No much decoration, no music - You are there for the food) Hint: Always ask for season fish and have anything special to try as yesterday try the milt (fish sperm) very unique taste.Recommendation: Very wide range of wine and sake, It best for buddy gathering and after work meal with friend

A friend of us introduced to this restaurant a few months ago and since then, we have been more than 12 times in the last four months! Always place available, you arrive, get the fish that you like from a counter, give it to the kitchen and will prepare very fast for you! Amazing quality!!!!!!! Good price!!!!! Restaurant is casual and just two minutes distance from Ikea in Alessandra Road! Parking is not easy

Went with friends on August 26 and as our first time recommended by other friends. We loved it as you can get yourself part of the food, give this to them and they will prepare as you wish. Very fresh fish and affordable prices. They have a few fridges, where you can get soft drinks, juices, water or even beer and Shake! Grace was our server and we liked that they have a loyalty program through Frasers Malls.We only pay $95 for the five of us

~I went twice in 2016 & back in 2017, my wife on her own trips prolly 3 more... this is truly a place for fresh Japanese sliced, cooked, sushi, sashimi etc everything in it's proper place with lots of changing seasonal menus and chefs that are as friendly as you'd find in Japan towards the Japanese :)~the font end grocer is also a treat for everything Japanese favorited and reasonably priced, while the fresh fish section opens up a pick & mix conversation on what you 'd fancy or be recommended... then a pass along the drinks section to whet your appetite before you're seated and decide what to order from the menuHere are my reviews from 3 visits, 2017Apr 2016Apr 2016MarAburi Shime Iwashi Sandwich - wow a ton of wasabi inside this oneKaisen Futo Maki - lotsa fresh goodness inside, my daughter took this to goKurobuto Tonkatsu - dual layered pork lion cutlet quite ordinarySalmon Avocado Maki - as usualTako Ika Karaage - fried octopus & squid YUMzChawanmushi - savoury steam egg ahhh I didn't eat this but I remember it's sumptuous YUMzGinka Don - cooked on the outside, raw on the inside, SUPER FRESH my wife & daughter both loved thisArabiki Sausage - definitely juicy and full of bursting flavors with the salt/pepper mix and token mustard packs a small punch YUMzKurobuta Oroshini - savoury pork with grated radishes brings back memories of this lip smacking broth YUMz Kani Gohan - of course the crab pilaf to go with anything YUMzKani Cream Croquette - this version is super delicious always order a couple YUMz x2Chikuwa Isobe Age - fired browned fish cake with seaweed, surprisingly delicious YUMzEbi Fry Maki - just as I recall YUMzPotato Korokke - creamy texture SHIOK with the sauceKurobuta Kushikatsu - pork cutlet on skewers, a twist of flavor YUMzEbi Katsu - love the full sized prawns stuffed inside goes just right with it's sauce YUMz x2it never fails to brighten up a feel like Japanese day at the Fish Mart, they keep bringing in the seasons and you relay feel like you are having the experience of Japanese foods at just that time of the year... if you want no frills no extravagance yet quick & friendly Japanese without the rated authenticity but real real close, always pay a visti to the Fish Mart Sakuraya no one has come close yet

Had a lunch meal at the Sakuraya branch inside Parkway Parade.The ebi tempura was dry. So was the tori ten isobe age. The rice in the bara chirashi wasn't koshihikari; worse, it was also dry. The seafood toppings are not generous at all.Fortunately, the maguro (from the chiller display) and the morsels of maguro and hamachi that served as toppings in the bara chirashi tasted fresh.Ocha is tasteless.Service is lacklustre

First time visit and went with a Jap guest. Had to walk through the supermarket to get to the restaurant which is no-frills, casual-like. Menu is rather varied, interesting part is we have to choose the sashimi from the supermarket which is properly packed in styrofoam trays with prices clearly labelled. We had octopus, tuna, yellowtail and salmon belly. They were really fresh. Jap guest said food was really good. However I felt that my grilled saba wasn't charred enough for my liking

Exterior is a mini supermarket stocked with Jap stuff and quite a wide range of sake. there are the usual bentoes, udons, sobas, donburis which you can order. the sashimi is interesting. you pick it up from the supermarket which is packed in those styrofoam trays with prices labelled clearly. and they slice and serve to you at your table. went with a Jap guest and he said the food was very good
