Quite expensive $11 for a coconut soft serve with 3 toppings of chia seed macademia and cocoa nibs. The soft serve doesn't have any coconut taste at all
4
Food is great but the areas are quite tight. The crab salted egg pasta was just nice. House wine is cheap and reasonable quality.
5
Amazing environment. Coffee is really good! Has an amazing manager who smiles and makes the place vibrant. The pancakes are must try for breakfasts and buffolo wings at night with beer!
5
We had excellent food every time we visited this place. There are many other cafes around the area too so you could choose to do a cafe hop if you wish ;)
4
My friend, who used to work around here, took us here. It is located in an intersection of business/nightlife area, so I loved the atmosphere. Having dinner with beer at an outdoor table will make you feel like a local.
3
Came here for lunch today for a beer sandwich. Quite tasty with fairly tender slices of beef and salad and mayonnaise. Very busy at lunchtime and a bit of a wait is to be expected.
1
The star is for the polite crew that served us during my visit - the only good thing worth mentioning. Do not visit for dinner - the place was packed to the point where there was no room between tables, and my friends who ordered (overpriced) mains had diarrhoea the next morning! Won't be back
5
Went for breakfast and were absolutely blown away by what we received. The almond lattes were super tasty and the breakfast were not only a taste sensation but also a hearty portion size. More than your moneyâ€™s worth. Really sweet atmosphere and setting, a must when in Singapore.
3
I visited Sarnies on a Fri evening and it was rather packed. Service was excellent despite it being rather busy. However, the seats were rather cramped and uncomfortable (I was sitting on a stool). My only issue was the cramped and uncomfortable seating. Recommend to take the outdoor seats as it is more spacious
1
Ran out of practically all on the menu, when asked the guy at the counter for a veggie option he told me chicken salad, seemed lost when told him there was meat hence not vegetarian... a mix of friendly and very unpleasant people. No apology for the limited choice. Guys get organised ... ridiculou
4
Sarnies is at a small restaurant in telok ayer. Relatively easy to find. Restaurant is abit dark. Chairs abit uncomfortable
4
Ideal for catch up with friends over meals. Limited food selection but worth going when there is ongoing promo deals.
3
Not sure why this is so popular. Food is average at bests expensive too. Toilet is super dirty that’s sad
5
Food is really good. Their bacon especially was very well done. Pasta was fresh and hand made. Huge portions!
4
A super chilled out spot for after work drinks, especially at the outdoor patio bit. Happy hour promo = $30 bottle of wine?!? what else do i need to say!
4
Good breakfast menu with lots of vegan-friendly options. Many dishes had salmon but when we ordered there was no salmon left. Male cashier was pretty rude and clearly hated his job. Thankfully the food was well priced and really tasty.
3
The coffee here was pretty good. Everything else was fine, nothing special. It was more like a casual restaurant vibe rather than a cafe. Nothing was bad, it just wasn't special. I'd go back if there weren't better options available... but there are!!
5
This place serves great coffee! You can have a break and sip your coffee, and it is very close to the cbd.
4
I had breakfast here - an iced latte, salmon, egg n avo wrap and their house made granola. The latte was ok, would have liked it thicker. The wrap was great! and chock full of ingredients -they certainly dont skimp on the avocado. Unfortunately, granola wasnt very tasty and the yogurt served with it was too liquidy.
5
Beware of the lunch crowd - this cafe is highly popular among the white-collars around the CBD area. Serving quality salads and sandwiches of hearty portions, you are bound to get your money's worth. Good cuppa too as their beans are roasted in-house. Highly recommend their brownie - very rich and chocolatey
5
Sarnies is a fantastic place for brunch, open early for breakfast and has great lunch options at reasonable prices-- the service is great too! Only issue is that it's too small and cramped-- guys you should expand!
4
Chill afternoon brunch spot - iced lattes - smoothies and sandwiches all above avg. The french toast passing by looked pretty epic.
4
We had the pork ribs and lamb. Omg both were so damn good! It was very unexpected as I assumed their specialty is in sandwiches. Definitely worth it
3
The indoor area too small. The services bad also. Food just average. Won't go for next time. Should hire more staff.
2
My partner and I walked up and down Telok Ayer until we came across a cafe bustling with people so we thought it must be good and so we sat down and ordered.Hit: my partners Salmon Salad, he absolutely loved all the elements to the dish and practically inhaled it!Miss: my bacon and egg muffin (not a difficult dish at all) Granted that Singapore might have a different idea on what a muffin is so I'll give that the benefit of the doubt....the egg and bacon however, unforgivable. The egg was like rubber and I'm not sure where the bacon comes from but it was like no other bacon I have tasted before.....yuk! Then to add insult to injury it was so overcooked you could pick it u and snap it. Granted there is a time and place for this amount of cooking but in a sandwich of sorts I have to disagree! The whole dish was so bad I must have only taken a couple of bites before I decided I couldn't go any further no matter how hungry I was
4
Was there in a group of 5. The food was not too bad... We ordered Sirloin, lamb shank and the pork ribs. Sirloin and lamb shank were thumbs up with the meat tender... The ribs was good too but the sauce made it too "jalat"... Good for sharing between 2 actually! The place was abit dark but great for friends catching up. Coffee was not bad too
4
I came here for the $1 promo. There wasn't a huge selection for this promo so it was settled on the Guacamole risotto. My oh my, this is THE BEST guacamole risotto that i ever had in my life. The warm risotto with the salsa and chips that are graced on the dish is an excellent pairing.The place is just a little understaffed, so we had to wait for quite sometime before we get to order our food
3
Have been visiting Sarnie for many years to enjoy their coffee, which is very good. Normally don't eat there as it's very packed and noisy at lunch time. Are the Moroccan chicken salad at the recommendation of their team. The helping of chicken is very generous- unfortunately it was very dry and overcooked.
4
the pork ribs (dinner menu) was totally a great deal to go for since the portion was quite huge and the meat was so soft.. i wish more flavor can be introduced into the dish though, as its kinda sweet.. the iced mocha also great:) the spicy buffalo wings were not spicy enough, overflowed w sweet sauce>_< the tacos were so-so onl
5
As my husband is lactose intolerant, we sometimes have to order vegan and vegetarian options to suit his dietary requirements.This place is amazing - the food and service is great and you can tell - it is always bustling with many customers, and the atmosphere is very pleasant.Highly recommend the katsu sandwich and cocowhip
5
Nice restaurant with low crowd. Great for dinner with friends on a friday night if you want to chat.
4
Great food, great coffee and the music is really nice. Just the place to hang out with friends on a friday night.
5
Food was excellent! I'm still full from my salted egg yolk pasta with crab 2 days after the meal, but I'm not complaining!
4
Located along telok ayer st just beside the historic temple, the restaurant is situated inside an old shophouse. Very nostalgic and food was good. We order the truffle risotto and chicken burger.
3
Second visit to the cafe nestled in telok ayer but the food and service were sadly slightly disappointing.
4
This is a review for the dinner menu at Sarnies Café.The most impressive thing about Sarnies is their curated range of healthy food and drinks options. In this visit, the foods that were ordered included their tacos, and steak. Sarnies serves three flavours of tacos: Skirt Steak, Cajun Prawns and Pulled Pork. It is recommended that you try their Skirt Steak, followed by Cajun Prawns but not their Pull Pork. Skirt Steak was the best among the trio, it just tasted fresh, and the individual ingredients worked well together. While I expected Cajun Prawns to taste like Thailand, it tasted tropical instead. The ingredients used were fresh, and the portion was generous. Overall, I would say that it’s functional.Pulled Pork was disappointing. This is because I had expected it to taste spicy and exciting. Instead, it was overly sour because they had used too much lime and it was not spicy, at all. Next comes their steak. The Blackened Grass-Fed Sirloin was perfect. It was crispy on the outside, but succulent on the inside – very impressive. What was also commendable was the truffle mash potato that came with it. While I couldn’t taste the truffle, the mash potato was so well mashed that it could be innovatively presented as the sauce for the steak. The areas of improvement for Sarnies include having better furniture arrangement, better customer service, and better music. It is humbly suggested that tables and chairs should not have been placed in the walkway connecting the kitchen to the outside. It was distracting for the guests and obstructing for the servers. What was further unpleasant about the experience was that the tables were placed too close to the counter, to the extent that chatter among the staff could be heard. Customer service could have also been better. Perhaps the servers could take the initiative to fill up empty cups or glasses, and look out for guests wanting to make their orders pre-meal and/or mid-meal. Lastly, genuine passion in serving would definitely create repeat customers. Lastly, while the décor of the café was very lively, the music did not fit the décor to create the right ambience. Perhaps positive, upbeat and uplifting music could be played to help create a warm, positive and homely feel to the café.
4
Finally ate in Sarnies after seeing it quite busy on previous Saturday morning. Fortunately we lined up ahead of a large group of early morning bikers. Place was packed. Freshly cooked breakfast served fairly quickly. Coffee was quite good. I had a heathy Tuna Tataki to go with my not-so-healthy sausage. My Wife had the toffee pan cake.A great place for a Saturday brunch
3
If you aren't picky with food and you're just looking for a chill place to dine and hang out after work, you could definitely consider coming here. The seating area is quite limited so I'd suggest you make a booking beforehand. They have happy hour if you're looking to drink. Their food potion is good but I would think the food quality can be improved. The pork ribs I had was slightly tough and the salted egg pasta was so-so as well. Perhaps you should go for the fried chicken burger because it looks amazing when served to the next table. They have about 20 seats indoors and outdoor seating as well. The decor of the cafe looks decent and pretty interesting. One more thing, the plates they serve will remind goh of your olden days as a kid (or a prisoner in prison) because they use metal plates!
5
Went here for breakfast, So good. Close to MRT for easy access. The coffee is delicious, the perk up i certainly needed on a lazy sunday morning. Ordered way too much food, definitely a case my eyes were bigger than my tummy. Portion sizes large. Service lovely, a really laid back vibe and the staff all smiling, Will be back for more
2
We ordered the signature chicken schnitzel sandwich and the salted egg spaghetti but we were disappointed. The dish was not hot enough as if it has been cooked and left unattended for around half an hour. Service was poor but countered by a friendly Indian waiter. There was no top up of water during the entire service. Ordered the brownie and it was okay, preferred to be hotter though.Cost $60 for a pax of two. Quite expensive for lousy food quality. will not recommend her
3
Ordered Moroccan lamb shank & coffee kahlua barbeque pork ribs.
Lamb shank is not up to my liking as it got the lamb smell.
I prefer more on the pork ribs.
5
ordered and shared the avocado risotto and seared tuna salad with a friend. was a great combination.
3
Food was bad, maybe just my dish. Small and tight on spaces, not the place to go to chill. Service was good thou.
4
Awesome truffle mushroom risotto and huge portion but prices are quite high! Recommend the risotto and pasta!
4
Nice lunch venue with fresh food and amazing staff who were extremely friendly despite the rush hour.
5
Very friendly staff! Had the salted egg spaghetti. Deliciously cooked. Recommend this place for gatherings in the city area.
3
the food took a while to come, but the smells wafting from the kitchen were quite shiok. unfortunately, there was not enough crabmeat with the tagliatelle and the chicken schnitzel burger was woefully dry.
3
Great Pasta & Risotto. But average mains. The place was pretty cold. But nothing could be done about the sitcon based on what the staff said. Take a seat outside if you don't want your food to turn cold immediately. I would totally suggest that! Appetizers were alright too. Order if you are starving. Give it a miss if you're not
1
Rude, rude, rude service! The server behind the counter just kept saying 'no, no, no' when I asked for a dairy free menu item. They advertise as having them. Another server was kind enough to come over 20 minutes later to offer me a salad off the lunch menu for breakfast.
5
Hungry, want great bread and amazing fillings! Here is the place for you. It gets really busy at lunch time so be prepared for that. But there is plenty of seating outside if you cannot find inside. I am yet to find a sanga I don't like and their coffee is good too! Service is good, not fabulous - but when you're busy what to do
4
It is very dark inside, I would not recommend anyone to work from there. WiFi is at 20 mbps, not bad. You can also sit outside, but there's no AC nor socket, also there's tons of traffic.
4
A very unique Indian fusion kind of cafe that brings out a very different feel compared to the usual cafes. The food itself has unique tastes and combinations as well !
3
Poor service countered by amazing brownie. 30 minutes for a Brownie dessert with no apology that's why only 3 stars.
4
Don't be fooled by how busy it looks: despite looking absolutely packed the place is quite efficient.
Standard breakfast food and decent coffee make it worth the visit.
4
Still have some room for improvement. Need to work on the lighting as it's a bit dark for dinner. It's better if they can improve the toilet. Staff service is okay.
4
We were ushered quickly to a seat and the staff was attentive when we wanted to order. Food was good as well.
5
fabulous food at a very reasonable price.
loving the tuna salad and they have reasonable price selection too!
5
I've been here twice within the same week now cuz it's that good. The food comes in huge portions for my tiny little Asian tummy so I end up having a doggie bag for lunch the next day. Not complaining! My friend at the chicken bun thing which was a mountain of food. I had the crab salted egg yolk pasta which was super yummy and had nice bits of crab meat. I also tried the pork ribs, another generous serving with mashed potato infused with truffle simply glorious. With the entertainer app we got one main for free so it's really worth it. You just gotta make reservations cuz the place seems to always be packed!
3
Servers always busy , hard to get their attention. Even if u managed to get their attention , they said they are busy , and come back to you later but never did . Ambience is dark and cramp inside , better off sitting outdoor. Food is average, coffee is good though , that's the saving grace .
5
Staying at the Sofitel, I always have a problem paying large amounts for a hotel breakfast. This place was a great find.Simple breakfast options, which are really tasty. Home made granola is really good and the breakfast wrap or bacon and egg sarnie all excellent and circa $10. Coffee is also good and prompt service and either air conditioned inside or out on the street; it's a great spot and great value. Does the job of a morning and is popular with the locals. Always a good sign
5
Great service, favourite of the night was indian curry pasta. Music was a tad loud in the inside of the restaurant though.
5
good food – especially the salted egg pasta and beef taco! but the buffalo wings weren't that fantastic.
5
Great little restaurant to go for brunch at weekends. Very casual and friendly. Quality food. Best to sit outside and soak up the local atmosphere. Very good value.
5
Wonderful atmosphere with great decor! Service was exceptional! We got our food so quickly and the quality was very high! Delicious and varied menu! Great presentation. Would give this place a 10/10 - definitely worth a visit!
4
We went there for Valentine's Day. Since we had reservations, we were seated inside. We had the steak and the pork ribs.
The pork ribs was lovely, though the BBQ sauce was a rad overwhelming.
4
The ambience was warm but if one is too tall or slightly on the big side then you may find the seat area abit too cozy. Else the food was good and came in large serving.
5
Best brew, healthy food. Always buzzing. You'll always see the mix of healthy gym rats, suits and start up/media people around.
It's because everyone knows the coffee is amazing and the food offer is quick, light and healthy.
Love it
3
We went at 10pm and the serving time for the main course was very long. We ordered steak and pork sausages.
3
I have been trying a lot of places around d Telok Ayer lately and saw this one had good reviews. I was a little disappointed by the atmosphere which I didn't really find friendly although the staff who took my order was really nice. Food was OK, nothing too special and thought the wrap was too expensive as it didn't have a lot of salmon and just salad inside
5
Stopped by on a saturday midday and it was busy but they were fast, efficient and the food was fresh. They have vegan/vegetarian option as well. Their raw pad thai is also a gf if i am correct anf for their coffee they have almond milk. Great spot
4
Really enjoyed the food here. Pleasant service. Cozy atmosphere.
1 bit of advice / critique would be maybe have a little more option for children's menu
All in all 5/5 can't fault the service and food personally
4
Really well made coffee, perfect for the mid-afternoon pick me up. Food look great, will have to come back to try!
5
Friendly staff, great food, good ambience. Overall was a memorable experience and look forward to revisiting
3
Popped in here for lunch today and this time tried the chicken schnitzel sandwich. This was quite tasty and service was reasonably efficient. Very busy at lunchtime and quite a pain to line up to order and pay first.
5
Very fresh concept with original dishes. There are also quite interesting drinks
The staff is friendly and the food is good.
Everybody can be happy thanks to the variety of the dishes.
3
Popped in here for lunch today and opted for the steak sandwich. Quite decent although the steak was a bit chewy for my liking. It's a very popular place and getting a table after 12:30 is a challenge.
4
A must try . Homemade granola with berries, honey & yogurt. Beautifully created. Also try the Fry- Up . Good portion. Value for $. Crowd can be busy over the weekend . Restaurant is conveniently located. It's only 3 min walking distant from the nearest MRT station
4
Got me whipped. Delicious, not too sweet and super refreshing. Stop by this lovely place in the CBD area for a nice breakfast catchup, post-run fuel up, or an espresso jolt. The place gets packed really soon (by 9:30am on a Sunday) so arrive early to get seating (indoor or outdoor)
2
There's not much option in the area on Sundays so we decided to try this place. Ordered the fry up breakfast and the chicken pesto salad. The salad wasn't too bad. The fry up..... errr.......it was ok until I found a strand of hair in the mushrooms. Would I go there ever again? If I can get that thought out of mind, maybe
5
One of the problems travelling overseas is finding coffee like you're used to back home. Starbucks would have us believe everyone likes over-roasted beans, or that it's about what you add to the coffee rather than the coffee itself that's important.Sarnies celebrates the coffee, and it was good. Boys enjoyed the smoothies as well. Nice place for breakfast with our two boys
4
The queue at lunchtime is long and itnis crowded. But service once you order is very swift and quality good. Portuons are on the large side and prices comparible for the area.
Coffee is very descent and overall good.
4
Good Sandwiches, nice coffee, big salads. Outdoor seating and popular for brunch & beer at the weekend.
4
We went to this @Pasarbella brach last weekend. We ordered 1 Flat White and 1 Skinny Flat White both were very good.
The coffee roasted in medium perfection, nice aroma, low acidity, half body and very good aftertaste.
The barista seem experienced and also friendly.
4
Enjoyed a yummy breakfast and good coffee. Both inside and outside tables. Centrally and conveniently located close to the CBD
4
Great coffee and pretty good traditional breakfast and lunch options. Queues can be long at peak times.
5
Hands down: Best coffee in Singapore (and they use bonsoy)!!!
Granola was delicious. Ate here two mornings in a row - great Aussie style brunch options.
3
The weekend brunch menu is quite expensive and limited in choice, but the food comes in generous portions. Food is generally good, except for the bacon - mine was almost burnt. We visited for brunch at about 10.30am on a Sunday. There are limited seats available, so we had to wait a bit to get a table for 5 (free seating). The wait for the food is excruciatingly long. If not for the Entertainer app (which gives me a one-for-one deal), I would probably head someplace else
3
If you want great coffee, you can't go wrong with Sarnies. The food used to be much better, as with so many places - standards have dropped. I had the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon on sourdough. Portion size was generous, with plenty of egg and slices of smoked salmon, but unfortunately the eggs tasted rather bland.
2
Went to sarnies for some snacks after dinner, and ordered the wedges with truffle aioli and the bacon bombs. Wedges with truffle aioli - awful. Wedges were obviously over fried, with the outside being no longer crispy, and chewy almost. The insides were dry. Truffle flavour in the aioli was barely noticeableBacon bombs - truffle mash wrapped in bacon. Can't fault the bacon but the truffle mash inside was, once again, extremely dissatisfying. Dry, and not smooth. Truffle flavour was barely noticeable once more.Disclaimer: I only tried the snack/bar food items and hence this review may not be completely reflective of the quality of Sarnies' food as a whole. I will, however, caution anyone against ordering their snack food.
1
Ordered a smoothie (mixed berry), smoked salmon bruschetta and hand cut truffle wedges. Enjoyed the 1 for 1 deal on the entertainer app.Firstly, no one answers the phone so don't try calling to reserve a table. Sent an online request but to be fair, they said they will reply in 48hrs and I was at the cafe less than 24hrs. So it might work.Secondly, the smoothie was severely diluted. Could only taste the fruits for half a second later, you taste water.Thirdly, wedges didn't really taste like it has truffle in them.Lastly, waited for 20 mins for my smoked salmon bruschetta (see pic) and it is not worth it for the price. My girlfriend agreed with me that it taste like filet-o-fish from macs. Just 4 times the price. Oh and for those who are using the app, do know that the wedges is considered a main. So if you order steak (24++, oh they had a shortage of beef when I was there at 7+pm when dinner starts at 6pm, like what??), the cafe will deduct the wedges. You have been warned!! Might consider coming back again to try the beef. I hope it doesn't disappoint like today's experience
5
A friend from work recently took me Sarnies for some Australian coffee. The location is perfect, it is a small but comfortable place to visit for coffee and conversation.
The coffee was outstanding and they have a great selection. Fantastic friendly service
4
Pleasant change after a week of Asian food. Nothing flash but great coffee and eggs and bacon for breakfast. Friendly staff.
5
Finally found a place in Singapore that serves muesli yoghurt and berries ...yay! !!
And great coffee
5
This was recommended by one of our family group, what a great meal we had. Sitting out on the pavement the waiter suggested making a surprise drink for one of the ladies, brilliant, and the food, one off each please.
Great fun meal
4
Normally pop in here after a gym session as they do decent coffee and breakfast options. Lunches and salads over lunch aren't too bad. Normally pretty busy - which isn't always a bad thing and a sign of good coffee!
5
This place is without a doubt one of the best brunch places in Singapore. The cafe has a really small and cozy indoor dining area which can be a little claustrophobic at their peak period. But fret not, their outdoor dining area is pretty spacious and being located along Telok Ayer Street, you get to appreciate the well-restored, heritage shop-houses that lined the street as your dining view.When I'm there, I get my usual Bacon & Egg Sarnie with Tomato Relish with an add-on of Avocado! The combination of all that is just heavenly (I am even thinking about it right now as I'm typing this!). The serving is really generous; if you're a female, you could easily share it with another girlfriend of yours. Some of the other recommended dishes will be the Either the Homemade Granola or Pancakes with Berries, Honey and Greek Yoghurt.And before I forget, their coffee is fantastic too so don't missed that out! I'm can't wait to go back there again for brunch already. 
4
Went here for lunch during a workday. Busy, but we were able to get a table pretty quickly. I really wanted to try the zoodles, which were out. Had the chicken kebab with couscous salad instead -- pretty good, but chicken was a bit dry. The friend I went with said the cocowhip (essentially vegan fro-yo) was a must try -- I really loved it. Not sure if it is actually healthy, but it was definitely tasty. I'd go back to try other food items
4
I've always avoided eating here because of the long queues at lunchtime. Today we were able to visit early and avoid the rush. Opted for the steak sandwich which was actually quite decent. Soon after we ordered the lunch crowd turned up and the place was very busy.
2
Sarnies has an exciting menu, multiple options that sound healthy and satisfying. Going by the crowds that throng the place, I was hoping for a really good sandwich! I had the Grilled Aubergine (Aubergines, Peppers, Hummus, Feta, Mesclun on Brown Bread). The vegetables were soggy and dripping into the bread, I counted all of two cubes of feta in the huge pile of sandwich - very underwhelming. The salads my friends got (Quinoa-Spinach and Halloumi-Cucumber) weren't bad, but nothing much to write home about. The coffees (Mocha, Cappuccino) were alright. In all, disappointing
3
Went out of our way to find this place for breakfast, as the hotel option looked dire. Very basic looking cafe, hard seats, old tables, not a place to linger for sure. At 9am they were out of some breakfast options, which are very limited anyway. Bagel and bacon was Ok, and coffee nothing special. Service and welcome was cool. would not rush back
4
Sarnies is a good place for a tasty breakfast or a coconut ice cream. Located in the beautiful area of Telok Ayer with friendly wait staff what's not to like?
5
Went here for a friends birthday, my first experience at Sarnies. And I absolutely loved it! Must get the espresso martini!!!
4
A great wee find, almost has a NYC neighbourhood feel to it. Though I was there for a business catch up, I'll go back with pals. Nice place to chill.
4
Love this cafe. It's my go-to place in the Telok Ayer area for the best latte, excellent steak salad and healthy berry smoothie. Excellent choice for those who want high protein, low carb diet options.
5
One of my preferred places:
1- very good quality food
2- Excellent service
3- Reasonable prices
Keep the good job!!
4
Have had breakfast at Sarnies every morning of our trip. Service was really fast and friendly, coffee was excellent (best we have had in our Asian travels) but breakfast menu was slightly limited. For those on a tight budget it may be an expensive option but if they have a healthy caffeine addiction and are coffee snobs it is worth a visit
5
A little cramped, and not the most comfortable seats, but really, great coffee and some of the finest brunch options for miles. Popular with westerners and locals alike, busy throughout the week, with smaller queues and a little more chilled at the weekends. It's worth queuing.It also has a healthy sized canopy outside to cover most of the tables if gets a little monsoony.My personal favourite, during the week, is the smoked salmon, scrambled egg and rocket wrap. Be warned, some of the plates on the weekend menu are big enough to share
2
We went out of our way to go here on recommendation from a friend. Entering we didn't feel welcomed. The menu is on the wall and had a small breakfast menu. My first choice wasn't available so i got the only other thing that was appealing, a ham and cheese muffin. I also ordered a flat white - which i was told they don't do! They do a latte. Kinda tells me you don't know your coffee which apparently they are well known for. If you can make a latte you can make a flat white.See picture below for the $8 muffin i received. I then looked around to find other customers (locals?) eating meals not on the menu that looked a lot better than my meal. Overall, it was too expensive for the product received. $7.50 for a large "latte" is ridiculously expensive. I have been all around the world and that is the most I've paid for a large coffee.Won't be returning and wouldn't recommend
1
Went to Sarnie's recently for lunch, and paid S$15.50 for Kurabota ham sandwich. Nice thick bread, okay amount of lettuce and chutney, one skinny slice of ham and a partial thin slice of cheese. When I left feeling hungry, I realized I'd consumed a wish sandwich. That's when you have two slices of bread and wish you had something in between them. My experience recalled my first two visits to Sarnie's: expensive (for what I got) and nothing worth mentioning
5
Absolutely loved this cafe, it felt like we could have been Melbourne. The coffee was excellent, similar taste to Blackboard or Cup Espresso in Queensland. The interior is cafe, staff were friendly and the breakfast selections were decent. Lunch menu looked good - didn't get the chance to taste it. Coyo was great. Well worth a visit
4
Great place to grab a coffee and just sit and watch the world pass by. Decent grub and reasonable prices. Staff is jovial and attentive
3
Really busy at lunchtime. Very popular with ex-pats. Good sandwiches. Nice bread. Sandwich and a juice $21. Not good enough to justify the cost.
5
The best spot I have found for bacon and eggs in 15 years of living in Singapore. Coffee, atmosphere and service are all spot on. Well worth a visit.
5
Their fry up, is so good, I love every part of it, it might even be too big, sure it's expensive, but most breakfasts in this city are and this place might be worth it.
3
The cafe is small but I like the ambient there. There isn't much choice for the brunch, so quite easy to make you choice. I had the scrambled egg + bacon with relish tomato. The bread they used to served was out of stock, so they gave me toast instead and of course with the reduction of the price. Scrambled egg is good, bacon a bit over fried, but still crispy. Overall, it is a pass.The coffee by default is double shoot and I love the flat white that they served, it tasted a bit sourish
5
A great place to either grab a quick takeout or sit. Has quick WiFi (rare around this area!), more quiet in the afternoon or mid morning if looking for a coffee and brunch or to hold a quick informal meeting. Also has amazing salads and also caters for the less healthy cravings too! ;) it gets very busy around lunchtime so get there early! Nice outfit area at the front too. Highly recommended
4
This place is known as a quaint, hipster cafe. My first time here and I will most likely come back again. My friend is a coffee lover and she says the iced latte tastes good. we ordered the ham & cheese croissant and scrambled eggs with salmon on toast. The scrambled eggs with smoked salmon tasted good. The amount of salmon was generous, scrambled eggs done just right,was not too wet.. I've spoken to the staff and was told that this place is always crowded on Saturdays- with people waiting outside even before its door swings open! Better chance of coming early on Sundays and you should be able to get a seat

I often come here as it is one of the only decent places to get coffee around the downtown area of Singapore.Their breakfasts are relatively reasonable in price and are tasty. Love their granola and fresh juices.My go to drink is the frozen cappuccino. Delicious on a hot day

Having missed breakfast in our hotel, decided to go to Sarnies instead and so glad we did! The coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, scrambled eggs and home made granola were all delicious. The service was prompt and this was reasonably priced for breakfast in Singapore.Definitely worth a visit

Singapore is an amazing city. Sarnies is in a great little street that you can watch the world go by. The food and coffee were great. We are bacon and eggs and also a paleo plate. Both were fantastic and in a city that is very expensive the 2 meals and coffees were approx $35 SGD. We were meeting a local that suggested we met at Sarnies. It definitely seemed like a local hang out which is always a sign of a good cafe.

Great coffee, free wifi and a good breakfast. I have not been later in the day but always busy and buzzing

tables not cleaned, don't bother acknowledging people walking in and clueless about what to do, is it free seating or what.. walked off!

Cramped feeling place. Food so so. Slow service. Popular with tourists but didn't see many locals. If you are in the area maybe but wouldn't go out of your way.

Great place to come for breakfast during your weekend. Even if you are rather on the lunch times :-)
Very friendly staff and good selection of bread and coffee.
It is tiny, cozy and mostly quite packed.

We stayed 2 days in Singapore. We had our breakfasts in Sarnies. Especially sandwiches were excellent.

If you look for an European style restaurant, this could be your choice. We had Greek Salad, Eggplant sandwich and a Steak sandwich, all quite good.All in all it could be a bit spicier but still great food for reasonable price.The coffee is excellent

The food here is really interesting in a good way. On my first visit I had the pulled pork tacos. So good I went back a second time and had the meatballs which were just devine!Travelling on my own and the staff really looked after me. When I went back another night in the same week the staff remembered me. Great service! And the margaritas are good too.

This place adapts a free seating concept, so, dont expect much service from them. But otherwise, I believe they are all nice people. You probably wouldnt get to feel it if you are visiting them during lunch hours, which they probably wouldnt have the time to. This place (due to the size and the massive lunch crowd) will be flooded with people (mainly foreigners/expats, and you wouldnt see much locals here... which i reckon is likely due to the price and they are a lot of other cheaper food options in this vicinity.)All in all, good place to hangout or dine if you are looking for some good food with a chic environment

This restaurant is great for breakfast and lunch .... haven't been in the evening, but I guess fun for a drink too. The food is great - you know what you are getting - no frills, but good food. The place is soooooo popular so go early! However, what is one of the best things about Sarnies, is the wonderful staff. Everyone smiling and happy. And, to top it all - I left my handbag in the restaurant during a busy lunchtime and guess what ... within half an hour, they had called me and returned the bag to me. Love this place ..

My friend who works around Telok Ayer, brought me to Sarnies for lunch, early as she said 12 noon otherwise no table.Ok.If not for Anne, I would never have come that early for a lunch, but she insisted.Cured ham sandwich was good, but if this is their signature, then there is no easy for me to rush down there in a mid-week lunch catch up..

The breakfast here is great, probably the best "western" breakfast I've had in Asia. I love the sausages and the baked beans. A little pricey, but definitely worth it for a treat.
5
Nice chilled atmosphere and the best bacon sandwich I have ever eaten! Crisp bacon, runny fried eggs and sweet relish on soft ciabatta, perfect!

I've been here for a sunday brunch... definitely go back there!! try the fried-up plate...
looks like being in the east village in NYC!

I have always wanted to try this place since some of my colleagues order breakfast from here and the food always smell so nice and look so good. I was greatly disappointed by my visit during lunch recently. My friend and i arrived at 12pm plus and the place was pretty packed in the inside. We had no choice but to get the table at the far end of the cafe which was not a good idea. Dirty dishes and cups were next to our table waiting to be washed and it didnt look too hygenic.I ordered a halloumi salad and coffee and my friend ordered the morroco chicken salad. I was really looking forward to my favourite pan fried cypriot cheese salad and when it arrived, i realised the cheese was the australia kind from the supermarket which was extremely salty and hardly edible. I would have thought for a $10plus salad with normal cucumbers and some basil leaves, the authentic cyprus cheese would be used. Obviously i was wrong. Moreover the piece of bread served at the side was dry, tough and not even warmed or toasted. It did not taste good at all.My friend's morroco chicken salad looked more promising since the portion looked substantial. But the chicken was so hard and dry we needed more water and coffee to wash it down. Some bad cooking. There was hardly any sauce on it.The only redeeming factor was the coffee, though the beans were slighly bitter, the milk and texture was smooth. Overall, i will definitely not come back for the salad

Great location for a quick lunch and and while the sandwich and salad offerings are pretty standard e.g. Moroccan chicken,the quality is high and the portions very generous but pricey. A sandwich the size of a door step (with tons of fillings) and the above mentioned salad $31! The breakfast menu looks great.The place itself is cramped with minimal indoor seating but who cares as there is plenty of outdoor seating area.The service is quick and efficient as well as friendly. Overall a good find and will definitely go back

Situated in the heart of the CBD, nestled in a shop house; is one of the best coffee shops in town.The coffee is superb, the weekend breakfast thorough and robust. Generally very hearty food, and smooth tasting coffee. The prices are a little steep- the full brekkie setting you back $24 (excluding a drink)... but the portions are great, and the food cooked to perfection. My only bug bear is that on weekday visits; the team seem distracted, and comes across as arrogant; and paying a premium can leave a bitter after taste. As with a premium coffee shops, free wifi would be a bonus; but sadly unaccommodating

Very happy with Sarnies coffee. Close proximity to the city, the café offers great service, healthy food and the perfect caffeine hit. In need of vegemite toast? This café even offers vegemite to the passing Aussie trade. One tip - weekend prices are different to mid-week. So go Monday to Friday. :

around the cbd and looking for a place pass your time? i would recommend this tiny closet cafe tucked away at the intersection of Boon Tat st and Telok Ayer st. Some may even walk past it without realizing but come lunch and after work hours, this cafe is buzzing with activities serving up great comfort food. Yes probably one of the best cafes around the area - Sarnies.Read more of my review --> http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/08/around-cbd-and-looking-for-place-pass.htm

Sarnies is the place to go ... for breakfast, lunch and also drinks/dinner. This place never stops! Sarnies has the best coffee in the area. The Telok Ayer Street area is very buzzy and this restaurant is well worth a visit. The food is fresh and they can cater for anyone's needs. I have only had breakfast and lunch (on numerous occasions), but I believe hanging out with a drink and having dinner would also be fun. The staff are great and soon get to know your name and your regular orders. I would thoroughly recommend

In the always fancy Singapore, it's nice to find a place that is casual (read: feel free to stick around after your food to have a drink) as well as serves very good quality food at fair prices. The terrace outside is relaxed in the hip yet not too busy Telok Ayer Street.The menu is diverse and the food is fresh and made with love (try the swedish meatballs!). The portions are quite small but fair to the prizes, so great to leave some appetite to try a dessert or just order several dishes to share with friends
