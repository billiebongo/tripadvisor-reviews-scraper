A pleasant experience. had the lunch omakase. was so stuffed from it although i did wish for more rice for the sushi.. the chef didnt ask..
5
The tachibana sushi set was super delicious and tasty. I truly love it and apsolutely love all the dishes i've had tried before.
5
Chef Ryoichi is the best! The food was excellent, our 7 years old Luca was only eating salmon before this dinner and here he tried different types of fish and is excited to come here again!
Thank you for the perfect dinner!
5
Very good sushi - one of the best spots in Singapore. And I am not grouping it just into Japanese restaurants category.
5
Picked this off Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. Traditional Omakase menu was excellent, good variety and all very fresh.
Service was also first rate - thank you Aileen.
Really enjoyed it, will go back. In my experience, one of the best in Singapore.
5
the food is definitely worth trying, if you are a sashimi/ sushi lover. Really good service, recommended!
5
Really good omakase though it's not the cheapest you can get. Quiet and nice ambience. The seafood shushi were really good!~
5
Probably my favourite sushi restaurant in Singapore - exquisite food and wonderful, friendly service. I canâ€™t wait to return.
5
Really good Omakase experience with very attentive service throughout the night. Had the monk fish liver for the first time which was amazing! Chefs are all from Japan so they could not speak that much English, but the waitress was always waiting behind ready to translate. Fantastic experience all round!
5
Fresh & premium ingredients that make great food. Chef is friendly & explained to us what we are eating. The sashimi is one of the best that we had tasted! The sushi is also very good as the rice is of top quality. We took the $350 Omakase dinner. We ended up full & contented. A very great dining experience indeed. Though costly, we are treated to only the best food, and it is worth every single cent
5
I had the Ayame lunch set which was excellent. the Uni and Ikura rice bowl was to die for. Yugi who served me was professional and friendly. Ordered an extra portion of Uni roll just because it tasted so heavenly.
5
Chef Hash, youthful, engaging and welcoming in his table! Made our anniversary truly special! Worth every dollar!
5
Another stunning experience as we enjoyed the fresh food served on the spot. Pricey it might be, but it's totally worth the price for the experience. We had lunch, so couldn't have the sake, which in itself, would be another wonderful experience.
5
Awesome experience! The sushi was fresh as expected and the night was made even better with a great Japanese Chef.
5
3rd time to Hashida sushi and the food never fails. Quality is really good, the chef and service staff were very polite. Chef was also nice to talk to. Will definitely return again!
5
Service, food, ambience were all impeccable. The otoro was super delish and fatty. Chef always checked in with us to make sure we had enough to eat, which we did. Stars commendable
5
Food is always amazing. Chef Hitoshi was very accommodating and chatty. He explained the type of sauces, his special knives and taught us how to pronouce the names of the fish in Japanese. We ecen had a good chat on which parts of Japan to visit and the food we should try. Had a really great time
5
A customer/friend recommended this place. Walked past the restaurant without knowing how good it is.Though the name is Hashida Sushi, this premium restaurant serves seafood theme sashimi, sushi and cooked 7-course meals.The menu simply states SGD300-500 per pax for an omakase meal (similar to menu de degustation).I am familiar with Japanese food, sushi and sashimi. And yet I was blown away by the quality and complexity (in taste) of the food served
5
Celebrated my husband's birthday at Hashida sushi. The restaurant is a Michelin grade, with amazing service and delicious food. We enjoyed every course of the meal especially the Uni and the Otoro. Kudos to the service staff and the chef for providing an amazing service to us!
5
This is omakase at its most authentic and absolute dining best. The service was impeccable. The chef, Sato Yuji, was chatty, friendly, very considerate, and really knowledgeable. I am allergic to soy and that's quite a challenge for a Japanese meal. But Satosan ensured I didn't lose out on the flavours. The serving, the plating, the preparation, and the careful thought that went into each dish as we watched Satosan slice, put together and plate, as well as the ambience all made this a fine dining experience extraordinaire
5
Best omakase and sake anywhere... the unique chef's fish preparation, serving, presentation and taste are out of this world.
5
Food quality is good, the chefs really do try very hard to please. However, you have to be prepared for the bill. It is really expensive.
5
In a hard high end Japanese restaurant in Singapore, Hashida Sushi is among the top 3.
Great quality, expensive but superb ingrediends and service
5
Great food specially prepared by the chefs. The chefs are interactive and service oriented. The staffs re interactive and attentive to your requests.
5
Really delicious and fresh sushi in a cozy environment. On the expensive side but you are paying for quality.
3
I've done at some great sushi restaurant. This one was rather disappointing. Due to the professionalism of the dining experience.
4
Service and food is definitely tip top, but it will be better if the price is lower. Went for lunch, cost ard 450sgd for two pax and didn't feel really very full.

Decided to give this place a try after hearing so much about it... every time u talk to a stranger at the sushi counter and they will mention where they have dine before and what's good in Singapore. We seldom dine outdoors in Singapore because eating out is too ridiculously expensive. Decided to opt for the $500 dinner Omakase and was seated with a fairly 'new Chef' who has just been on board for about 8 months and speak very good English. He was honest and direct in his answers (I mentioned that if he was back in Japan - he would still be washing vegetables in the kitchen before he can slice a fish at the counter and he agree). However, what makes the dinner a difference was he was only assign to just the 2 of us, whereas the other Chef was given 8 diners to serve on the same sushi counter (the restaurant has 3 counters). This allowed me to have lots on interaction with him.As others have mentioned, nice impressive setup and ambience, superb wine list and a corkage charge of $60 per bottle or 1 for 1 offer.I told Chef (he is going to be a proud Father next month as they are expecting their first child in Singapore) it was his lucky day as we offered him 3 glasses thru the night of Dom Perignon 2002 which we brought a bottle along.Overall great food quality and his first remark before dinner to us was - if we wanted quality or quantity. This guy knows how to please his customers and thru the dinner conversation and course by course meal we felt comfortable and satisfied.Would I go back to Hashida again ? It's a great restaurant but depending on the choices I have. For me it would be easier to take off to Japan and dine with some of the better restaurants at the same price point. At 40,500y per head I can dine @ Jiro, Saito, Mizutani and many others for lesser the amount. The Chef concluded that I have eaten more restaurants in Japan than himself
5
This restaurant only serves omakase, and it definitely was worth it - the quality and the detail that was put into every piece served was just unbelievable.This was our first time to Hashida and we were so happy to have Chef Hashida prepared our meal for us. He was amazing - the detail that he put into every piece ... Based on our taste and what he believes we would like to eat, he created culinary heaven! From the sashimi, to the sushi, and the dessert - even the ginger sorbet ... It was a perfect meal. Fresh, authentic and sincere - beautiful
5
Excellent chef's knife craft created Premium sushi that melt in your mouth. We love the Toro Kama ( fatty tuna cheek). It is a must try. Soft and silky; the freshness of the toro pair perfectly well with Hashida in-house sake! Chef Hitoshi is so friendly that it felt like eating at a friend's place.
5
Amazing experience at Hashida. Great food and service. Might seem a tad expensive, but definitely worth it!
4
This place transport you to Tokyo in a instance, and you will know that you are in good hands if you come into this place looking for sushi. Tried once, it is recommended, however pricewise is not very value though
3
The food is good, quality and fresh fish. But for me it was an average good sushi place And abit overpriced. For us we had no Budget the total bill was 1450sgd
5
Fantastic omasake for lunch - was full but not overly stuffed. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Quality was impressive. Looking forward to being back again.
5
Excellent place to celebrate birthdays etc and enjoy sushi of the highest grade! Service Ambience excellent ! Of course it's a little pricey but worth it if it's a special occasion.
2
The reputation and pedigree of this restaurant sets a high bar and expectations. Unfortunately, they were not only far short of the expectations but the chef that served us was at best an amateur that wouldn't even fulfill the basic requirements. We specified very clearly to service staff and chef to exclude tako and ika. Sushi chef acknowledged but overlooked this simple request not once but twice serving us both the above. The sushi was extremely fresh especially the uni and Otoro however, there was n obvious lack of passion and creativity in preparation and sequencing the tastes. Also, the chef was perpetually making mistakes with preparations falling over and at times even off the preparation table. The chef may have perhaps been too engrossed in continued conversations over the whole meal with an apparent acquaintance across the counter which I found rather disrespectful and unbecoming of any decent sushi chef. Rather odd and disappointing unexpected experience which tarnishes the legacy of this restaurant and perhaps the profession
3
Went for dinner and was in a 7-Seater room. Omakase price point between SGD350-500 per pax. Overall, the quality of food is definitely there and the chef and our waitress services are impeccable. Always attentive. As for the dishes, it didn't stand out in terms of flavor. I would say it's more blend but that's probably my own tastebud. The sushi rice is good and the last dish where the chef craft the tuna belly is extremely good as the meat simply melts in your mouth. For the price point, I will still rank Mitsuya as my favorite. Shinji will be next.Not the fault of the restaurant, there was a small commotion with 3 guests but our waitress handled the situation professionally.
1
Had the Tsubaki set for lunch. Perhaps I went on a (really) bad day, but the sushi was pretty deplorable for the price point. The service was just average too. You don't have to go far for much better sushi and better service - there's much better to be had in Singapor
3
Tried the Omakase lunch in Mar 2017. Each pax cost $300++. Food was ok but was not fantastic for the price paid. Don't have the Urrmmmm/Wow feeling! Can give it a try if you haven't but I will not go back since there are many other Japanese restaurants with better options if you set $300/pax as your budget
5
As per my subject..... it is as good as in Tokyo. Friendly staff and chef. My chef was Kenji Nakagawa, and he did a perfect job. I chose a middle priced menu, with a good bottle of wine (good list btw). I ended up spending a reasonable amount (again..... as in Tokyo !), but completely satisfied. Will go back for sur
5
Fantastic food and service. Thoughtful touches with Polaroid picture and card for friend's bday. setting cosy and intimate, definitely a place to go to celebrate special occasions.
4
The Omakase menu that I ordered was really good and service was excellent. Ingredients used was extremely fresh and of really good quality. An overall unforgettable experience!
5
We were very honored to be attended to by the Master Chef and Owner, Hashida San. The food is very fresh and nice, the staff, including the owner, is friendly and approachable! I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
5
Delicious, absolutely delicious food. Our service staff was also super attentive and thoughtful. She realised it was one of our birthdays and brought us a treat!
4
Went back to Hashide for a second time and is still impressed by the quality of the food. However, service quality is not as good as the first time perhaps we were allocated to the biggest room with full capacity. Hope the restaurant can review and improve in this area. Nevertheless, it was still enjoyable
5
Had omakase lunch and chose the most complete course. Superb sushi and sashimi. The fish are so fresh they literary melt in your mouth. The course includes Skin tofu mixed with Ikura and Uni, Cawan Mushi with Ice fish, Mizu Tako, Chu Toro, Kimedai, Tai, Ainame with egg plant, Flounder sushi, Kampachi sushi, Ika sushi, Ikura mixed with Uni and rice, Kama ToroAnagoService is good. Staffs are really friendly and attentive. Price is high, but worth your money. One of the best in Singapore
5
I lived in Japan for over eleven years and I was pleasantly surprised by just how good Hashida Sushi is. It would not be out of place amongst the best in Tokyo. The fish and seafood is perfectly fresh, very well selected and cut and presented by a master of his art. The restaurant is rather incongruously placed in a shopping mall but once you have entered the decor and atmosphere are all Japan. There is a good selection of sake. Chef Hashida himself is charming, engaging and with a rather un-Japanese dry sense of humour which all adds to the occasion. Prices however are comparable to Tokyo
5
(Dined twice in November, once in December)Finally had a meal at Hashida after hearing so much about it. I'm no stranger to fine-dining sushi restaurants, so with this perspective, Hashida was wonderful.My gripe and issue with many sushi-counter restaurants: Japanese sushi chefs can be aloof, slightly cold, and at worst, rude and sneering to non-Japanese patrons. The chefs and staff at Hashida not only speak good English, they are genuinely warm and friendly to ALL customers, not just the regulars (and there were many!). Our chef, Sato-san, made an effort to engage with all customers and chat with them about fish, Japan and anything else.I think that important first step to being warm and friendly to non-Japanese customers mean that a good relationship can be established, one in which Sato-san is able to offer what each customer likes.I understand there are four options for lunch: $80, $120, $180, $250. We had lunch on a weekday and selected the $120 menu, which included nigiri sushi of course, also a tofu appetizer (with dashi? Kombu? Jelly, ikura, (real) wasabi), chawamushi (with seasonal fish in it), small Hokkaido rice bowl of uni and ikura (served with wonderfully smoky miso soup) and dessert (Merlin macaron). The nigiri sushi were sublime, perfectly made: the Shari (rice) was delicious, each fish complementing it, already with wasabi and sauce painted atop the fish, or perhaps a different but appropriate condiment -- a slice of perilla leaf with the ika. I remembered we had baby barracuda, flounder, hamachi, ika, anago, tamago and chutoro.We enjoyed our first lunch so much we made a reservation for lunch two days later and opted for the $250 meal. Which was sublime. With the $180 and $250 menu, one gets an additional plate of sashimi before the sushi, and only with the $250 Hiragi meal does one get an additional dish (in this case we had Hokkaido hairy crab meat smoked and steamed wrapped in bamboo leaves-- no picking of crab meat necessary as all was de-picked!) and the piece de resistance: the famous slab of marbled kamatoro/ toro/chutoro/ brought out, and the chef shaving curling slices of it, atop the gorgeous Shari, packed perfectly -- use your hands now, and pop it into your mouth and just let it melt!!The sashimi platter was fantastic too: there was tako, scored perfectly, so tender and sweet. Lightly aburi Tai (red snapper) was spot on. There were two pieces of otoro too. Japanese fruits (honey dew, persimmon and pear) were offered for dessert for $250 menu.I mentioned to the chef I adore ankimo, and he got it prepped for me. Hashida does it differently -- they use a sweet prawn sauce instead of ponzu, and it was very, very good.Obviously will return. It was less stuffy and formal than Shinji, and with a good rapport established, you could get to eat what you really like. (But admittedly, both Shinji and Hashida are top-notch, in my books. Better than two-Michelin starred Shoukouwa
5
I have been to all Michelin star restaurants including the top sushi restaurants such as Shinji and Sushi Ichi. I wanted to try Hashida because of all the good reviews. I went with high hopes and Hashida surpassed all my must expectations.It was a very interactive and enjoyable dinner under the excellent care of Chef Hitoshi Oyamada. He made great effort in enhancing our dining experience by explaining each dish and tailored the dishes served according to our individual palate.Each dish was delightful and presented in a spectacular manner to stimulate the senses of sight, smell and taste. By the end of the meal, I had decided that Hashida Sushi is now my favourite restaurant, and I cannot wait to return for a second round
5
With strong recommendations from many friends, we decided to celebrate our 35th anniversary cum Christmas Day lunch at Sushi Hashida Singapore. We have so much funs here in addition to the excellent cuisine here.We have chosen the $250pp menu for lunch, but Master Chef Hashida-San was so kind to added items from the evening menu to commirate our occasion, really nice of him. He was also very kind to agree to our request to personally serve us.I must mention that watching him slicing the raw fish etc is an enjoyment itself, so much techniques, sharpness and precision to go into it, he is also a trend setter, being creative based upon immediate past traditions, he often shave lemon peels onto sushi to create a refreshing feel is adding to the joy of eating, he is also very creative with his sauce for the sushi, infuse with other elements such as yuzu to have a wonderful ending of sushi tasting...very impressive and enjoy so much about the food there.BUT most importantly, Chef Hashida-San is such an easy person to talk to, he has good command of English, allow us to have ongoing conversations with him, as he has lived in many countries before and with broad exposures, so we really able to converse so freely and so much fun added to the meal...typically we go to sushi counter, always faced with a stern looking Chef with no English language, at time is boring and at time is awkward, just to finish eating there. Today we have a total different experience, plus Chef Hashida-San is so jovious , that really make our meal superb here.PLEASE do not miss visiting Sushi Hashida Singapore if you are good connoisseurs or simply looking for a good sushi meal. I will come back for more and for sure
5
Excellent sushi right in the heart of Orchard Road.
The sushi was excellent and it always helps to have a friendly chef to make the experience better.
The special cut otoro sushi is a must try!
4
We had Hiiragi for lunch. Very good food quality, presentation. Nice ambience and services. Definitely will come back!
5
Master Chef Hashida delivers a wonderful dining experience. The fish was perfectly fresh, seasoning just right and the setting is quiet and personal. We very much enjoyed chatting with Mr Hashida while he prepared our lunch - we will be back!
4
Unlike other famous Jap resturant in Spore, here I do not have a preferred chef. This place is my first choice for Jap Omakase , especially for dinner. Although it is not cheap, it is value for money compared to other top Jap restaurants here...
5
another visit to hashida and it never disappoints. every dish was delist right down to the dessert. this time they served a merlion kaya dessert which was made on their own! made of mochi rice and white chocolate and white miso for fillings, it was wow at every mouthful. very delightful. the ikura and uni don was fresh as usual and I wish I have more of it. thank you for the amazing service and meal :)
5
Looking for a night out in town? I think Hashida Sushi is your answer. Omakase menu ranging from $350-500 per pax. However, if you add in additional dishes it will add on your bill. Ingredients are fresh, chefs always explain to you what you are putting into your mouth. If you love ikura and uni, you will definitely fall in love with their ikura uni rice bowl.
5
Had lunch . Chose the 120 ayame set..came a silky soft tofu starter..cawanmushi..then 7 pieces of exquisite sushi ..a mini uni bowl...dessert..a tribute to sg..biscuit in shape of merlion w KAYA inside..absolutely a divine combi.Svc was tops. We had a great time. Chef was frdly. Wish there was a beef option..definitely a must go pl
5
I just like it so much that I have been to Hashida Sushi three times in two months. It is definitely not cheap but I will say it worths every cent. It will give you the authentic Japanese dining experience which is more like an art than cooking. The skills of the chef are amazingly top notch. A real enjoyable night! Pairing with this sake is a perfect choice
4
The Long and Short:Well the short first: This is the best sushi I've had in Singapore. But certainly not the best sushi there is. Bring someone you want to impress! Or you can save a bit more money and go to Japan instead. Either way you will enjoy yourself. The Long: We had the Omakase for dinner. While the range is $350-$500, we ended up paying $400 per pax. Mostly the food was excellent, and the nitpicking were perhaps more to do with the preparation and presentation -Occasionally, the seaweed propping up a piece of sashimi would not hold its place, a slice of lemon would fall over, or the maki was not perfectly symmetrical (though it cannot be overstated that it could have been the best dish of the night, with the bonito sashimi up there).This is not a pure nigiri sushi place, so there were many other side dishes. Mostly they were delicious. The Chef serving us was also friendly and spoke English - Chef interaction elevates a sushi meal for me. The verdict, if you're not going to Tokyo soon and have a celebration to justify it, why not!
5
Flew to Singapore from KL, just to have lunch at this restaurant. Been hearing too much good review about this restaurant and I am so, so glad that they open on a Sunday. Friend who resided in Singapore, made a reservation one month ahead. Love the idea that they only have counter seating in their restaurant. Because it really make a difference. Besides, I really like to see the chef's action while serving our meal.Our reservation was at 12:30pm but I arrived late from the airport. They waited for our party to be complete before taking our order. I ordered Ayame because I only like nigiri sushi. We were served by Chef Hitoshi. Because I thought that head chef Hashida was not around. But actually he is around all year unless he went back to Japan. So, it's advisable to ask them when you called them for reservation. It's okay to request to be seated in front of the chef that you prefer. Chef Hitoshi was halfway serving other party, so we waited for a bit before he made our starter. I really like the environment at Hashida. One of the chefs who served at another room, came to our room and was being very talkative, when Chef Hitoshi introduced us to him, saying that we're from Malaysia and can speak Japanese very well. All through our meal, we can hear ourselves laughing and even laughing from other room. It was a really enjoyable dining experience.Every piece of sushi was very fresh and delicious. The shari was a little bit too chewy (?)for my liking. Actually, the shari was a bit too hard. The uni and ikura bowl was okay. I prefer the one at Sushi Oribe in KL. Hashida's version lacked sweet taste. I would definitely ask them to add one more ingredient to my rice bowl, the next time I revisit.At the end of our meal, Chef Hitoshi asked were we full? And I added a piece of ootoro sushi for each one of us without asking the price. Luckily the price tag was acceptable
2
Had dinner there a while back ago. Mediocre Japanese food, not great, not bad, just not spectacular enough to justify $900 for two.
Have not gone back since.
5
We visited for our anniversary and the food was very good. We had the omakase and let the chef decide. Our needs felt very personally and precisely taken care of. We will be back for a repeat visit.
5
Didn't realise that this was a Michelin rated place but was invited for a business lunch. Immaculately presented sushi and great service, just that too expensive to warrant using your own funds unless it is a special treat! Will be a great venue for a special occasion
5
Although budget is high, but definitely a worth place to visit. And I like the way they serve dinner, that there is no al la carte food, everything you will get is from the omasake menu. The Chef will arrange the food according to your specific request.
5
Every dish was crafted to perfection by the head chef Mr Hashida. Nigiri sushi served was very well-balanced in taste, temperature wise of the fish and rice were in perfect harmony. Chef even treated me to a few complimentary dishes! Brilliant service, will definitely be back
5
Oh Hashida, how many ways do I love thee? Let me count the ways.1. A quaint little walkway leading to delights2. Gleaming beautiful high quality wooden dining counter tops3. Friendly, happy, skilled chefs who bustle about 4. Privacy guaranteed by having no prying eyes 5. The fish ohh the fish each delectable sliver of the sea on your tongue6. Portions of rice well suited to the south East Asian appetite7. UNI, barracuda, ishigaki clam8. Service that spotted a minuscule flower on my mat and quietly took it away9. Chef Hatch who still serves customersMichelin inspectors how dare you to have left them out.
4
The main store is in Tokyo (owned by Chef Hashida) currently under renovation, this restaurant is run by his son, Chef Hash, a promising young man who has acquired great skills when it comes to preparation of sushi. It was a pity that this place did not receive a Michelin one star. The set lunch was pretty good with uni and chutoro and a display of Chef Hash's meticulous skill. Service is excellent, will certainly visit again
5
Another impressive Japanese sushi restaurant in Singapore. Hashida serves slightly more cooked dishes with its omakase, but the sushi is the standout out. Chef Sato is very meticulous and careful with his plating. Every piece is sliced as you watch. This may mean slightly long waits in between courses, but they are worth it!Some interesting seasonal fish is on offer. Everything tastes really fresh. I'm not a fan of mackerel, but the horse mackerel was light and refreshing, devoid of strong of odours. The Chef said that the restaurant receives a new supply four times a week! The various cuts of tuna belly were awesome. Sake was slightly on the pricey side. The servers could also have been a little bit more conscientious in topping up water, clearing plates etc. But I'm really quibbling. This is an excellent dining experience, and I highly recommend it
5
Had lunch there recently. Blown away by the extremely fresh seafood. One of the best sushi I have tried. Rice cooked to perfection and maintained at optimum temperature. The seafood is so fresh the master chef claimed they need not be frozen! BUT be prepared to pay for the freshnes
1
I have tried much better restaurants including Tokyo Michelin starred sushi restaurants. The standard of this is really average. What is totally outrageous was the chef gave so few pieces and we were charged $450++per pax. I was still hungry. Really pathetic. Please go to waku Ghin, Shinji or anywhere else. This is a total rip off
5
'twas my first time here and the food & experience was superb! staff were very accommodating and food was so fresh. price is too high for me but definitely worth it.
5
One of the best omakase places Singapore has to offer. The chefs know what they are doing and staff are polite to a fault. You are almost transported to Tokyo!
5
Had lunch here and it's my first time for dinner. Dinner is true omakase style, just tell the chef if you have any dietary restrictions and off he goes. Price is $300-500 and if you don't say anything , he charges $400. Stop early and it's $300 and with extras cost $500A parade of wonderful dishes ensues, including lots of fatty tuna, sea urchin , caviar etc.I had a Japanese friend with me so that experience was lifted with the interaction and the chefAn excellent mea
5
Four of us came to Hashida to celebrate and I wanted to thank my best man for all his help during my wedding. We chose the Omakase without any limit and had a bottle of sake to share. We sat at the counter in a "private room" and the counter could seat 6 so we had another couple seated next to us at the end of the table, which was fine with us as we were mesmerised by the performance by Chef Masaki as he pieced together dish by dish. Every course was a joy to eat and chef entertained our questions and curiosity, and also some of our facies. eg we wanted something Aburi and he gladly whipped something up. The uni was super fresh and he showed us the spikes that were still moving as he handled the sea urchin. One of my friends was allergic to seafood and chef gladly swapped her seafood offerings with other fish sashimi. We were very impressed with the fresh wasabi root grated against shark skin and not the typical cheap paste wasabi that came in a tube. The sashimi was super fresh and the plating and presentation was extremely pretty with the flowers and leaves. As we enjoyed course after course (we must have had 10 courses?!?), chef could also gauge how full we were and finally gave us a rice dish with chopped tuna belly at the end. We also had japanese fruits and muscato grapes which were supposed to be very special, but actually I thought was quite normal. oops! haha. All our photo taking antics were warmly welcomed and chef even joined us in a group photo at the end. We were given a thank you card at the end of dinner and wondering when we can afford to come back here again for another celebration. Dinner in the end came up to $500 per person including the sake and it was very expensive but given this dinner was with my wife and my best friend and his wife too, it was worth every cent. Lunch is a lot more affordable and you can enjoy the same high quality food for around $80 to $150 depending on how big a meal you want. If you are planning a decadent meal to celebrate a special occasion, this is definitely worth it. Hope you find this review useful! :
5
Absolutely LOVE Hashida sushi. Been here for both lunch and dinner and not disappointed both times! Had the $400 dinner course and was thoroughly impressed. Seafood was all extremely fresh, chef was very knowledgeable and happy to chat and there was a lot of food. Definitely think it was worth the money. All super premium sashimi and beautiful toro in three ways. For this dinner it was a celebration and the staff were very accommodating, chef made a special toro sushi in the shape of hearts and the waitress took a polaroid and then wrote a note. Definitely a special experience. Lunch was also great. Good value for money and still a very decent amount of food. Still included uni bowl which is definitely a highlight. One of my favorite omakase restaurants in Singapore and highly recommended
2
We found the service and the sushi to be below what one would expect at this price point. Service staff were not very well trained and service was well below the standard one would expect. Before we were even seated there was someone standing at our shoulder asking what food we would like to order. We were not even asked about drinks, until we had to catch someone's attention to take the order. The seafood was fresh, but the sushi lacked character and was fairly average. The Shari came apart in a couple of pieces of sushi. We have had much better sushi and service at restaurants charging half the price
5
We were recommended Hashida by an omakase lover and it definitely did not disappoint. Went for a birthday lunch with my husband , 13 and 11 year old. We were all wowed- star dish was the uni and ikura- I was rather hoping that Mr 11 year old wouldn't like his uni so I could eat it for him but no such luck! Chef Toshi was friendly, fun and engaging. He made a special heart-shaped tuna roll for us- birthday gift he said. Nice touch was a personalized hand written birthday card with a Polaroid photo taken by staff of our family that was presented to us at the end. Definitely worth a visit- it's on the pricey side but so worth it
5
We had lunch and like all diners, were seated at the sushi counter, so we enjoyed watching how the sushi was prepared and bantering with the chef. The dishes were extremely fresh, one of which was still moving (not as gruesome as it sounds). They have a wide sake selection to cater to every palate. It's a little pricey but the whole experience was rather worth it
5
This sushi establishment from Tokyo stands for matchless perfection, period! Every thing is exquisite, from the supreme freshness of the seafood, the artful presentation of each offer, the most graceful kimono-cladded waitresses, to the most cordial and skilful chefs. Had Michelin had a 10-star award, I would have voted for this restaurant without reservation! Hashida is every sushi aficionado's dream comes true

The seafood is very fresh, but that's the case at all the Japanese 'grandees' in Singapore. The setting, service, and most importantly the food, are of course very high-quality (as they should be at this price range), but they're one notch below the level of the top sushi places - Shinji, Ki-sho, Ichi (now closed at Scott's Square but to re-open at a different location in the future), or the less traditional versions like WakuGhin. MasterChef Hashida is a happy person, he puts in emotions in his cooking, and he's young - so I am sure he will continue to progress..

The food was not bad but nothing really impressed me besides the rice bowl and toro, personally prefer Shinji for more impressive food and more valuable for money :)

Hashida definately serves high quality sushi and their sushi chefs are dedicated to just looking after your group. Recommend lunch menu for better value. Dinner can expensive.

Great experince of omakase lunch in sg. Bill for 2 at S$630, quite expensive but it is a great experince. I was served by the master chef Hatch Hashida. He is a young and nice guy. You are advice to make reservation at least 2 weeks in advance if you would to serve by him

This is a whole dining experience especially if chef Hashida prepares the omakase. He is professional in his service yet entertaining and funny. The reason we come here fairly often, apart from the freshness of the fish and its very high quality is the amazing service and the uniqueness of some of the signature dishes. Hashida has its own recipe for chawan mushi which is delicious as is the sliced ginger ( soo good!! ) and the chu-toro and o-toro slices that the chef will slice off a huge slab of tuna. I recommend the mid- priced menu as it is the best value for your money. This is my

Saw this place a while back and had always wanted to try it. Finally, was lucky enough to be there last night.Given my current diet, I couldn't eat a lot of the raw fish. However, my friend did. And Hashida san was kind enough to prepare his innovative vegetable dishes, grilled fish and seared sushi. A rare trait among top class sushi chef - when most of the time, they expect you to just eat anything they give you when you arrive at their seats.The sashimi was sparkling with freshness. Apparently they are flown in directly from Tokyo and Hokkaido daily. The portion were generous. Most impressive was the toro sushi, where he takes the best parts of a giant piece of tuna to make a "toro madness." Fresh, succulent and it just melts in your mouth. Service was attentive but not over bearing. Atmosphere was peaceful.Sushi chef Hashida san makes even his own dessert - a perfect compliment to his beautifully and deliciously prepared dishes. Not inexpensive, but worth every penny

We spent 600 dollars per person and even for Singapore i can easily find a large number of JP restaurants with better service, food and value.It's in a shopping centre, although the chefs tried the business wasn't interested to impress we left feeling very short changed for the money we paid.Service staff didn't make an effort, they should for this price!We had to top up our tea and sake. Sashimi though though good wasn't really the best in the country.Certainly not worth the money they charge unless you are desperate to impress a date, a client, a new boss - otherwise there are many better places in SG! If u r none of the above there are many places in SG that will make you look smarter

This restaurant is getting great buzz and TA reviewers had recommended lunch which is cheaper than dinner. What they didn't mention is that lunch has 3 options: $80/$120/$250!! The restaurant is small and tucked away on the second floor of Mandarin Gallery beside Takashimaya on Orchard Road. It's a long sushi table with a little peninsula so groups of 4 can face each other. The place was packed for lunch today but I had made reservations earlier in the week. There were 2 sushi chefs and while things slowed down a bit while they took care of other customers, it was fun to see what others were eating. The people next to me ordered the $250 lunch and it was very elaborate. I went for the $120 meal and the cod milt chawanmushi as well as salmon roe and uni chirashi were included. It looked like the $80 meal got soba noodles instead of chirashi. The food is seasonal so I won't go into all the plates but there was a delicious white miso soup as well as tasty nigiri sushi (sashimi with $250 set). I will say that they use quite a bit of lime and orange zest and I'm not a big fan of citrus (yes, I understand it's a garnish - I'm simply stating that I don't like chocolate covered orange peel, so finding it zested on the bean curd, chirashi and lime juice on the tuna and flounder didn't appeal to me). Overall, while the fish was fresh and service was impeccable (they replace your teacup with a new cup of tea when you empty it) I have a hard time putting that much money down for sushi. I think if you're looking for a new experience the $250 menu is the way to go. They received grilled offerings and sashimi but no chirashi or chawanmushi that I noted but the sashimi was different. They seemed to really enjoy the flavours. I left before they received their nigiri. In the end, I can't justify spending $250 for sushi. I know the fish is better and the fresh grated horseradish merits spending >$50 vs. the cheaper sushi joints but $250? In the end, it depends on your value system and whether you think it's worth it

Some people have said that Hashida is as good, or even better than Shinji, and maybe even slightly cheaper. So i have to check it out for myself. Located in the Mandarin gallery mall, it's usually full, so make reservationsSimilar to Shinji, it has 2 sections, and today i was lucky to have the smaller and quieter section, manned by 1 chef. He's Japanese of course, and speaks halting english. The concept is similar to Shinji, mainly sushi, but not as pure. They do have 2-3 dishes apart from sushi, like chawanmushi with cod sperm for example. All good sushi, especially the chotoro, but i somehow felt that the sushi portions were slightly smaller than Shinji. The ambience was also more stiffAll in all, a great meal of course, but i still think Shinji is ahead by a nos

Lunch set is great value. Fish flown in from Japan and the chefs will choose the best cuts on the day. Decor and service is of a Japanese standard and the chefs are friendly and talkative. Same standard as Shinji but at a better price (for lunch at least)
