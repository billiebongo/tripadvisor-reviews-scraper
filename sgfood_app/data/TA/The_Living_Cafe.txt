Excellent, wholesome and healthy food in a light-filled environment. Interesting menu and good service.

My first time there. Had a great time discovering that healthy eating can be tasty too.
See picture below - taste as good as they look üòÅ
Had hazelnut flat white. Think I won't ever have the regular flat white again.

Healthy and creative food ..pretty impressed with food options for vegans.
Would definitely recommend you to try.

Vegetarian and raw food trend attracted much crowd during lunch. The pizza with its super thin crust is unique, but it tastes just average. Mushroom with eggs pizza, an interesting combinations.
5
Healthy food choices catering to a variety of different dietary needs. Food is always amazing every time we go.

May be my expectations were too high after reading their menu and seeing some pictures, but I was utterly disappointed by the food. I had the brown rice bowl with chicken and it was almost inedible. The rice was totally overcooked, all mushy and tasted watery. The little bits of chicken that found their way in there were totally bland and tasted of nothing. In fact, it was so bad that I complained, which I never do as it always feels a bit awkward, and the chef prepared a new bowl for me. The rice was cooked better, but the whole dish was still tasteless, no spices were used, not enjoyable at all. Also had two end root pieces of lettuce in there, not acceptable at all. Waitresses also not very friendly at all. I can honestly see, worst food I had since living in Singapore

Bright and cheerful, located conveniently next to the MRT station. In case you are driving, parking can be a challenge. Their food was healthy, interesting and creative - we had Spicey Chicken burger, pumpkin, and mushroom soup, flaxseed chips n humus dip. The Chocolate cheesecake was enjoyable.
2
Hard to tell if the food is authentic when presented in a patty form factor. I had the salmon burger in a lettuce wrap and I expected an actual fish given the hype about this place. I think there was salmon in the processed looking patty but I am not sure. It is not uncommon for places like this to substitute. I do not recommend this place for protein people, perhaps for the vegans.
4
The cafe was located just in front of the Sixth Avenue MRT. The first level is for dine in while the second level is the shop. The place offered healthy fusion dishes with options for vegans, vegetarians and gluten free.6th AVENUE ROSTI ($18.50++)herbed sweet potato rosti, smoked salmon, asparagus, onion, poached egg, wasabi aioli Although the serving looked small, I was quite full after having it. The rosti looked quite thin and dry but there was a sweetness which came from the sweet potato in it.SKIN SMOOTHIE ($8.50++)banana,orange, raspberry, strawberry, soy lecithinIce blended, the drink was thick, smooth and fruity in taste.Overall food was delicious and the place was quite cozy there was only a couple of tables occupied during sat morning
3
Thumb up the good theme for healthy lifestyle but the food is not as good as expected. The avocardo soup tasted a bit too sour and raw. The blueberry cake also tasted strange without the use of dairy products. The fish was also quite dry and blend.On the other hand the coffee with the choice of soymilk or hazelnut milk tasted as good as normal coffee. Also like their signature spiced chicken burger and recommend the tasty lemon cranberry tart.The service can be improved with less stone-faced staff
3
The food was good, but pricey and in my opinion nothing too special, though very healthy. My Bircher Muesli was just topped with loads of nuts (but, too much to be honest). Our table was shaky and staff was not very friendly overall.
3
We are raw food consumers for quite a while and we weren't so impressed with the place. Dishes are relatively small and not satisfying (example - very small acai dish for 15$) juices are OK - not enough options and you can't make your own mix. The raw desserts are very nice, I ate a very good chocolate spirolina ball. The service is OK and atmosphere is nice. The shop upstairs is very pricey relatively to prices you can find online. We tried it once but wouldn't go back again.
5
Located right outside the Sixth Avenue MRT station. They serve an all day brunch menu, burgers, rice bowls, pizzas and more. We ordered a Mediterranean Omlette and Chicken Burger, both were delicious. Service was efficient and the place has a casual vibe to it. Shall go again

I'm a carnivore by trade, and not overly interested in being "ultra" healthy. So The Living Cafe is unlikely to be my normal go to, but I found myself looking for something different and there is was. Any dish with meat substitutes is 100% disregarded, but they do serve chicken, so the Hawaiian Chicken sandwich was up my alley. And it was good. Really nice texture and solid flavour in the pineapple. Not my normal choice of venue, but a good option, especially if you have more "picky" friends.

Spent sunday morning bfast with 3 friends here. I am not a fan of the seating. It is uncomfortable and the AC was not working well. In singapore that is crazy. Move to another table and asked staff 3 times abt Ac...eventually seemed to switch it on. Slightly better Order wholemeal pancakes and omelette. Very dry...and no real taste for both. Smoothie...-the hulk - okey. Bill was abt $65 per couple which I find expensive. Staff couldnt care less for example would bring 2 glasses of water for 4 people...seriously will not go again .
5
Food is raw or dehydrated and grown naturally and supposedly chemical free and unprocessed. I'm sure it all is. But you can trust theOwners to have that integrity for healthy food. Most of the chocolates are a little too raw to my liking but I still enjoy them. I go for their power drinks just for kicks. Still somethings I just ask for their most unhealthy dishes, which is pan fried fish. Haha
5
This is a great place to go to have a healthy fix, with vegan, vegetarian, gluten and dairy free options. The prices are equal to any other similar caf√É¬©, but the quality of the food is outstanding. The dessert counter is a dream come through to vegans! I tried the spiral zucchini with pesto and my daughter had the spiced chicken burger. Both were great, but the zucchini is more suitable for those that are already used to the vegan style. We finished sharing a Raw Chocolate "Cheese" Cake. It was to die for! It's actually impossible to imagine it is vegan and gluten free. I totally recommend it for a day outing, because it closes fairly early at 7 pm. Parking can be done on the Guthrie building behind, off 6th avenue.

We was there for a brunch on saturday. The cafe is perfect located near the MRT station "six avenue" and lovely furnished with industry style interior. I love the plant based concept of the coffee shopand also their menu. We've tried raw cake, granola and two smoothies and everything tasted fresh and delicious
4
There aren't many true healthy cafes like Living Cafe in Singapore featuring a menu of diverse organic, vegan & vegetarian options. For brunch, the big breakfast and wholemeal pancake were good. Oddly however, they don't serve jam for the toast! Beverages include non-dairy options such as hazelnut, rice & soy milks. Service is friendly but not great...just one example, the server didn't know the difference between a flat white and latte. All in all though, still one of the best of it's rare kind in Singapore
2
I'm not sure but today is the third time I have come around out of visiting this cafe about 10 times, certain things don't taste the same... In the living salad the usual subtle cashew cheese served with it that tasted natural and raw, seems to be replaced with something of a very bright yellow consistency and the garlic flavour inside it is way too overpowering... It does not taste raw... It's too salty...The raw veggie wrap was also not served with raw dressing :( instead it was covered with balsamic glaze... I was used to getting a raw natural dish, seeing that it is a raw cafe.I've had a lot of their desserts, I used to like the balls, but after tasting the spirulina ball today, I almost felt like getting sick... It was not the same as usual, firstly it was way too oily, secondly there is so much other excessive sweetness to the ball - it does definitely not taste the same, it used to be a bit drier in texture and a soft touch of sweetness..The coffee is seriously horrible, it has a burnt taste... Disappointing Not too sure if I'll go back, being a rawfoodie myself, I'm gutted to say this... Just my honest feedback
4
We have been to The Living Caf√© a few times, we always tried new items on their menu and every time we discovered new tasty dishes.
Certainly a strong recommendation for brunch and lunch. Try the deserts with a freshly brewed coffee!
3
If you're looking for an authentic place serving healthy `clean' food, this is the place. However the prices are on the high side and portions could be a little larger for the prices that they charge. The cafe is spacious and bright but always seems understaffed, with servers looking harried. Try the Rice Bowls, which are my favourite, and the smoothies. With the new Downtown line now open, the cafe is now conveniently located next to the Sixth Avenue MRT station
5
I can not recommend this cafe enough! It was an example of how a healthy cafe should be run. Complete with the inspirational quotes, raw vegan desserts and one powerhouse of a salad after another, you felt healthier just walking into the place The decor was modern, bright spacious with clean cut lines and vintage, rustic furniture. The tables are dressed with flowers and bottled water, each and every detail is taken care of. The chalkboards are decorated with the healthy motos/quotes, which add a modern edgy feel. The mirrors at the top of the walls bounce light around the room making it more spacious and airy. The food was outstanding, I got the nori rolls which were nothing short of a work of art and as much a feast for the taste buds as the were to the eye. I then got a pumpkin salad with an abundance of spinach and nuts and seeds with feta cheese. I'll be doing my utmost to replicate it at home. I couldn't stop there I had to try more, next up was a mint mocha square which was perfection on a place. If this place had a cook book I'd jump at the chance to buy it. To conclude: Presentation: A1Food:A1 Decor:A1 If any critical feedback could be given from the visit, perhaps the staff could have been more attentive, we'd ordered coffees and one was forgotten and the service could be improved upon. Otherwise a wonder find in the heart of Singapore. Will be recommending to a friend!

We went there for lunch and we had high hopes given that the prices are on the higher site. we were the perfect test group because we represented asia, india and europe and we had different meals. in short: non of us was happy. the food was tasteless, boring and a total waste of money. the salmon had no seasoning and the mushroom soup was thin like dish-washing water. We all have had healthy food or vegan or vegetarian before and we liked it. we spoke quite a while about this lunch... staff is very friendly, atmosphere is very good and food presentation is good
5
This place caters to vegetarians, vegans, as well as meat eaters. We've tried just about everything on the menu, and it's all good. "Raw Taco Boats" are made with walnut meat, a must try and all of their wraps are fabulous. And, don't forget to leave room for dessert! We've also tried all of those as well. They have options that will please everyone. Prices are medium-to moderate, but portion size is good and taste is great

This restaurant is a little out of the way and not in the most beautiful location but the food makes up for it. As expected, the food and drinks are a little pricey but really make up for it with the chilled out vibes and great service. Make sure you go for some of the raw options and a couple of raw treats for pudding!
5
I've been to this cafe a few times and I think is a pretty good option for people looking for healthy eating.I usually get their juices which I really enjoy! They are refreshing and full of nutrients. Their salads/brown rice bowls are really tasty, but most of the food in the menu is on the pricy side. I did order a cappuccino once, but I don't think soy milk makes justice to their coffee.Most importantly, this place is for a very specific clientele. If you enjoy healthy eating this is your place! But I can see that it might not be for everyone!

Came here for a family lunch celebration. It was the first time I'm trying 'raw food' and I have to say its different, but really delicious. Nice caf√©, and beautiful setting and desserts. Prices are a little on the steep side, though... wish these healthy foods were made available at a more affordable price
3
My first try of healthy eating. Quite tasty food and good service. However they should seriously consider not charging for sauces. We asked for extra sauce and waitress said it'll be extra cost. Next table wanted tomato sauce and waitress said extra cost. With them amount they are earning, they can just give it, why charge
4
I just visited The Living Caf√© for the first time a few days ago, the place was great, and the food was great as well. I was with my family, we had the salmon spinach pizza (the dough (?) of the pizza was amazing), wild barramundi brown rice bowl (gluten free), and the breakfast burrito (vegetarian). They were all so good!!! I just started to try eating healthier recently, and they certainly made my introduction to healthy eating even better, would visit again soon
4
The food was great. though some people may not be used to the extreme raw dishes like raw burger or pizza. I recommend trying their desserts; their really good! Staff are friendly and atmosphere was nice. Might be a little pricey.
4
The ambiance is lovely and warm. Enjoyed the decor and seating.
Loved their tofu pattie burger and lemon grass tea!
Give this place a try, if you are a healthy food enthusiast or even otherwise!
5
We love Balanced Living Cafe, but we've recently been turned onto the desserts. You should try the vegan chocolate cheesecake. It's enough for 2 people for 2 days as it's quite rich! We are not vegans and we love it anyway. Give it a try.

Food is delicious and its a nice restaurant. Showed up on a Saturday afternoon and they weren't packed. Service was okay. I ordered the salmon and mango ...(can't remember what the last word was). It was delicious ! The portion is huge and although I ate it, I was full after half of it! For drinks I had a beet juice- it's $8 and is basically they same thing you get on the street so wouldn't recommend this juice unless you really love it. The coffee was good! I had a soy cappuccino. Overall this might become a regular eating place for me. Prices are high but you get your money's worth in food and flavor!
4
I first came across the Living Cafe via their shop where I pick up health supplements and thought I would give it a go. I was a bit dubious of the raw and raw-fusion food concept to begin with however my mind was changed as soon as I tucked into my breakfast burrito- it was unbelievably good! I could really taste the freshness of the ingredients and it was good to know that I was eating healthily at the same time. While I went for a weekend brunch, I would be very tempted to try The Living Cafe for dinner sometime, especially a glass or two of their biodynamic wine
4
From the moment you walk in, you feel good in this place! They have done something so right with the ambience. The food is targeted towards raw and healthy options. (vegan focused, but offers chicken and salmon). The raw options are the best I've seen in Singapore so far! Taco's are great! Order the raw chilli sauce to go with it. (I had extra Cashew cheese too, YUM!) The juices are delicious as the smoothies! The staff are fabulous, so friendly and make the experience even better! The Specials are always a good choice to go for too! Well done! I am a big fan

The living cafe is a friendly little spot on Bukit Timah Road. The staff are very helpful, and the ambience is very laid-back. The organic offerings are tasty and well-sized. We had the salmon "burger" which was tasty and not dry, as salmon burgers can be, and it was accompanied by sweet potato wedges which were also well-cooked. We also tried the chicken burger, which had a touch of sweet chilli to it. That was also very good, and had plenty of moisture and flavour. Smoothies were excellent, and despite feeling indulgent, were really quite healthy
4
I am happy I visited this place for lunch yesterday with my family. Though I wasn't so excited about the salmon burger I ordered (salmon pattie was a bit too dry, and so was the bread) I know that I was putting in goodness in my body. I will for sure go back to try out the other dishes in the menu. Must try- the juices! Amazing!! Also I loved my coffee! Ordered soy cappuccino and was it one of the best coffees I've had or what! I left restaurant really full and knowing that I had health clean food!
3
Although located in suburbia, with limited parking space, the fact that the place is filled up at lunch is a sign that the food is good. And it is, for the ambience is minimalist/farm-style, and service quite absent (although the service charge is optional here). There is a food mixer at the counter which operates at deafening noise levels - something not very green. But the food is good and healthy. In particular, the liquids (raw soups, drinks) are yummy. It's not a vegetarian eatery, they do have protein dishes, but don't expect shark's fin or pork belly

After being spoilt in Bali for their delicious and affordable organicFare like what Clean cafe and KAffe in ubud, earth cafe in Seminyak can offer, the balance Living cafe at bukit Timah seem the closest answer to the health-conscious who are willing to pay a premium for their chow.The ambience is shabby Sleek, food thumbs up, variety and menu choices could be improved. The provisions and products up at the attic could be better stocked or perhaps in they are in the process of it. Books, jewellery, households, stones, aromatherapy etc. I'm loving it.Am absolute delight - to remind you to Stay healthy. We are what we eat
4
definitely a great place if your health conscious, but bring along a patient mind as you'll need it. service is very slow.

Wonderful food. Thoroughly recommended for breakfast, lunch or Baruch. Great coffee, smoothie, breakfast or snacks
5
Had brunch at this lovely little cafe. I was lucky to get a carpark up front. Loved the food and drinks selection. My bf and I had the omelette and salmon with rosti. They were really good. I wanted more! LolThe raw desserts were irresistable.Excellent service too.Definitely a place i would visit more often.

At the heart of TLC menu is RAW Food or RAW-Fusion Food. It uses no red meat, no cow dairy, no white sugar, no preservatives, no additives, no artificial colorings and include gluten free alternatives. So if you are quick to spot the (loop)holes, this place is not entirely vegan, as it serves things like salmon and goat cheese.Starters were the hand-cut Sweet Potato Wedges ($4) that were earthy and good. Lightly baked with olive oil, it did not had the tempting smell of fries from fast food outlets but an alluring scent of coriander seeds. Some might find it rather firm but these were perfect for napping in the home-made mayonnaise (made of cashew nut milk, lemon juice, water, olive oil and salt but no egg yolks.)Follow that up with TLC cheese burger ($15): a dehydrated patty of portobello mushrooms, almonds and sunflower seeds, topped with tomatoes, sprouts and romaine lettuce. I stared in disbelief at the bun-less burger as those burgers from the opposite tables had buns and cheese.Though the mushroom patty had a robust aroma, it was tough and dry, not aided by an unidentified bland orange sauce Wished it was a simple grilled Portobello mushroom with garlicky herbs. But there were good things like the Mexican-inspired Raw Taco Boats ($12). My trepidations of greasy wheat glutens dissipated when the two large sized mock meat turned out to be made of dehydrated walnuts. The light guacamole and mango salsa sauce had a touch of Indian flavors, probably because this dish used similar spices such as cumin. While the savoury food were wholesome, it was the RAW desserts that blown us away. Each had their own merits and everyone declared our own favourite item. I love the Raw Dark German Chocolate Cake ($8.50) made with Dates, Zucchini, Coconut oil, Cacao Powder, Irish Moss Honey and Macadamia. It was compact and chocolatey, not too sweet despite a toffee-lookalike honey layer on top. The shards of fragrant toasted coconuts were a bonus.As for the Raw Blueberry Cheesecake($8.50)made with coconut oil, agave, cashew and lemon juice, we could not be bothered by the alien-sounding ingredients such as psyllium husk, soy lecithin, Irish moss, as we dived straight into the delicate mousse and crunchy base. A bit of sweet and a bit of summer fruity flavours, we did not miss the sharp tang of cream cheese.Tiramisu (actually we all did) was made of natural coffee extract and sitted on chalky and fragile almond-flour cake base. This is literally an authentic tiramisu sans the fats from Mascarpone Cheese and Raw Egg Yolks (Yes, tiramiusu is made of raw eggs too). And who says tiramisu must have the alcohol to taste good? Honestly, I left the place feeling more satisfied than I had expected (perhaps it's due to eating "Real Food" ). However, the fact that nearly every dish were full of (grinded) NUTS, drove me nuts a little. Perhaps I would still pick Indian/Chinese style vegetarian food from Raj Restaurant over TLC.

As Raw Food Critics and Chefs ourselves and we are always pleased to find new gems to our list of must-visits. Currently touring Asia, we have a good idea what is out there. We loved the raw options and fresh juices in the restaurant but was blown away by the store, which is super-stocked. Hard to find items from USA like the Mega-Hydrate or Quantum Labs supplements can be found here. There is also the most extensive selection of raw food books and spiritual literature, from David Wolfe to Angel Tarot Card pack by Doreen Virtue. Hail to the store that has it all! There is a daily special to look out for with good combination dishes. I would love this place to franchise or move to more central location
4
I really liked the variety of raw desserts and snacks they had there, and we enjoyed eating them indeed. However I was quite surprised to have to pay 50 bucks for 3 drinks, 1 piece of cake and 2 pieces of chocolate. The place is really nice though, and has a kid's corner which gave me some precious extra minutes to enjoy the food while my toddler was playing
5
the food here is so tasty, loved the flavours and the added benefit that it is all so good for you. It is hard to find such clean healthy food in Singapore. The desserts are to die for. great coffee to. Plus a really great atmosphere and reasonably priced.
5
This restaurant has something for everyone - raw, vegan, vegetarian, or meat eater. I was very impressed by the quality and taste of the food. I have been eating raw food for quite some time and I couldn't believe how good their raw dishes were! Definitely try the desserts
5
Finding healthy wholefood in Singapore has been a bit like looking for the holy grail, but discovering The Living Caf√É¬© was as good as it is going to get. What a fantastic, imaginative menu. Full of great salads, vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes and tasty pulses, plus a wonderful selection of desserts. The restaurant itself is clean, bright and unpretentious. I even found somewhere to park outside, first time ever in Singapore! Can't wait to go back there
5
Lovely setting, great availability of healthy snacks, nuts and most importantly all the food are yummy and tasty, yet super healthy!. We tried the Living salad, some kinds of raw pizza and a sandwich and all were yum. The smoothies were very tasty and energizing (we tried something with raw cacao). Our favorites were the blueberry cheese cake and the cranberry chocolate - the list might be extended when we try more next time. Can't wait to come back
