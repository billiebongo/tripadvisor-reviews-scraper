Quality of seafood is fantastic but the spread of sushi variety of food could have been more given the price charged for weekend buffet.
3
The spread was very little. Dessert is extremely disappointing. The only good thing is the service staff is very nice.
3
nice atmosphere. good view to outside the hotel. friendly staff and attend to your needs immediately.
4
We booked the Christmas lunch and free flow drinks package. The deal was good value for money the food was most satisfactory; good supply of seafood. Providing decorative hat and tiara and clacker on the table was a nice touch.The Christmas pudding was excellent.
4
First time visiting the restaurant. Food was good, not too crowded. Staff was very efficient with clearing of the plates when the guest leaves the table.
5
Frankly speaking overall the review is good. As the past year there is only a minus point the Christmas decoration is very simple. Food standard improved Alot maybe the hotel use more fund on food which is a thumb up
5
Although it was a buffet, there was an extremely friendly waitress who even served us drinks as we were chatting away. She even kept on asking to eat more.
5
Service was great, oysters were very fresh. Spread was decent and food was nice, dessert could be better. Overall great experience.

I visited cafe mosaic buffet twice during normal days & it was not bad at least the buffet serve decent oyster, cheese etc... so I brought my family of 14 people to enjoy the buffet for LNY this year 2018 but the spread was sad. When I called to make reservation, I was told it is international buffet & oysters, cheese the usual spread will be available but NO it was not. Though it is the LNY but there is no western food fare, no cold cuts, no cheese section, no oysters... my family didn't enjoy the buffet lunch & I felt cheated bec I asked before I made the reservation.
4
Book the buffet dinner, spread was pretty good. Highlight was the freshly shucked oyster! Spread includes ashimi and fresh seafood such as mussels, crawfish and prawns.Restaurants has long tables, do consider this venue if you have large family gathering.Special mention to waitress Vivian, she is a service Gem! She provides the personal touch and show warm hospitality to all customers
5
Lovely service Super foyer Xmas Decoration Food Exclusive setting super Menu only few halal Choice hmm
4
My request for a table away from the kitchen was not accede to even though there were many other tables.
4
Enjoyed the spread and delicious food, the cooks were very friendly and attentive to replenish the dishes. Good and attentive service from the wait staff and they are friendly. Well done.
5
Fresh food, excellent variety, tasty. Most importantly not too taxing on the wallet. Would definitely recommend this place for a good buffet spread.
5
Value for money for holiday buffet. Has activities for the kids. Has props at the table for New Years festivities
5
The place is for oyster lovers! The oysters are fresh and big. You are able to select your favourite oysters, and they will shuck for you on the spot !
4
This is our repeated visit to this buffet restaurant. Juicy Oyster and tasty pastry is the prime draw.
4
The prawn noodle station - good to have have choice of yellow noodle or bee hoon. It will works well for those who appreciate bee hoon :-) Well, the set-back was the missing of nursing room for mum & baby. Guest has to settle the baby at Raffles City :(
5
Celebrated my Christmas with my fiancÃ© in Cafe Mosaic. It was his first visit. Although it is a 1 for 1 buffet however we are pleased with the serving and the Christmas decoration, ambience from the restaurant. The service crews are quick to clear our dirty plates and fast to respond to our requests.
4
We have a group of 8 people and we celebrated a farewell for a colleague cum Christmas dinner. There is wide choice of the buffet spread, fresh seafood and oyster, and the cakes are surprisingly soft and not too sweet. The service is nice, and the staff clean up your table pretty fast. Price is on the high side but you can enjoy 1-1 offer with some credit cards. Generally we have a satisfied meal and experience with cafe mosaic!
4
i like the cold station most. sushi is nice! fresh oyster and cold prawns.cooked food maybe can improve especially mee siam, maybe can be more sour
3
Food variety is not much for the price paid. No crabs nor durian puree which can be found in most international buffer. There is only one type of sashimi, salmon.
4
Food was average for the price and venue was large which made it suitable for large groups of people
5
The food was great esp their cold station and the dessert station. The food at the Hot station was delicious as well. All my friends love the place and we had an enjoyable time
5
Nice ambience and a wide range of delicious food. Nice for family as well. A good place to chat and have meals
5
Booking was easy and restaurant had good food and service. Family enjoyed the dinner and we are happy!
5
Good buffet spread, fresh seafood, will recommend to friends and other. 1 to 1 is worth enjoying an sumptuous meal, hotel shall offer more of this promotion.
4
Visited for my God-mum’s birthday dinner. Food selection was adequate with its fresh oysters standing out as succulent and large. Great value especially when we paid with Citibank since it’s 1-for-1
5
It was my son's birthday celebration. Everything was excellent from ambience, service and also the variety of food items. Definitely will return next for my birthday in December....
5
Great spread of quality food, great and friendly service. Great place for gathering and celebrate birthdays. It will be prefect if it come with complimentary parking. For non-driver, MRT stations are nearby...
5
Location of the cafe is good, choices of spread is good, taste of the food is good and service staff is very good. Though air condition is rather cold for the ladies but manageable.
4
The service and quality was excellent but given the price paid and the amount of space, can afford to have more variety.
4
Good customer service. Their catches were their fleshy oysters, delicious crayfish, tasty mussels and fresh sashimi.
5
Super fresh oysters shucked on the spot. Nice octopus sashimi. Service staff is attentive and friendly, couldn't ask for more. Wonderful dinner experience with family
4
Dining options surrounds you both in and across from the hotel. Good place to sit and work with view of lobby.
5
The food was awesome. Awesome quality with delicious delicacies and other international cuisines. Definitely worth the 1-for-1 buffet dinner!
2
My reservation was reflected as cancelled when i reached the restaurant even though i just changed the date and not cancel the reservation.
4
There have credit card promotion for some banks 1-1. Another $5 top up, can have free flow of soft drinks or chilled juices. The variety of food consider quite reasonable: seafood like fresh oysters, salmon, crayfish, scallops. Hot dishes like chicken, lamp, prawn, fried noodles etc. Salad, pasta, Japanese sushi.
4
Came here because of UOB Dining Promotion of 1-for-1.Ambience was quiet because it was a weekday. But overall, it was a nice place. Came here a few years ago. Comparatively the spread was definitely more than the recent visit. Fortunately, the food quality is above average.2 suggestions:1. Complimentary Parking for bills above a certain amount could be issued to diners.2. Instruction to diners for the optimal temperature setting on the heating machine to hear up the bread and you tiao (Rojak ingredient). This is so that the you tiao could be heated to a crisp which is a vital ingredient for rojak
1
the lunch buffet spread was miserable, not as per what the website claim to have: sashimi and oyster. dessert was not fantastic as well. food quality not up to standard. mainly local hawker food, not worth the money ($60+)Intend to utilize birthday voucher and had quoted when making reservation online. was told that the voucher was not valid only when am personally at the restaurant. Staff should take responsibility to inform customer before hand when reservation was made with such note indicated. Will not patronize again in future
2
Have tasted better food than what is being offered here, for the price, it's a not worth to dine here at all. There is nothing special.
3
Buffet spread is excellent , freshness of the seafood, thoughtful menu (traditional Chinese soup) , local food, teppanyaki corner and nice house wines. Definitely going back for food. Credit card promotions Super awesome.But service needs improvements. A hotel that required guests to self serve ice water is hardly acceptable considering the buffet is 88+++. Staff didn't seem well trained nor readily tuned to attend to customers. No warmth across all staff who attended. They are not lazy but customer experience felt almost transactional. It's a pity if lose customers because your food is great. I hope Carlton hotel improves coz I want to return to enjoy the food
2
Beautiful Hotel and very spacious restaurant. Unfortunately the food selection was very limited and the taste average quality. The price for lunch for what your received was well above any reasonable value. I was wondering why this huge restaurant was empty. Just because you put some Shrimp in the buffet doesn't make it lavish. Staff were preoccupied even though we were basically the only ones there, bad service
5
I had my last birthday celebration at this outlet recently and had a wonderful time. The buffet spread was wide and had a good mix of local and international dishes. A commendation goes out to Ivy, the server who took great care of us at our table. Her interaction and hospitality won us over.I would recommend going to this outlet, regardless of the occasion
3
The restaurant covers a huge area and the management thought well not to have every space occupied with a table. Hence, there is thankfully ample space to walk around without knocking into a chair.The buffet spread covers 4-5 counter spaces with each well utilised for the huge smorgasbord. Our local favourite Popiah is available at the live station. We asked for 2 of them (one with chili and the other without). I believe my request was misinterpreted because both were prepared without chili. When I clarified, chili was merely spread atop one of the rolls.Nevertheless, the attentive staff, particularly Ivy; made their rounds clearing empty plates and cutlery, though a little interaction would be welcome when doing so (for some team members).To add on, Ivy also offered to bring us another 2 rolls of Popiah, this time properly prepared. Well done, Ivy; keep up the good job
3
The cafe is situated inside the Carlton hotel and offers all kinds of snacks. Coffee is rather expensive at $7.50 and the service leaves a lot to be desired. Even though there were only two other tables with people it took ages before we could order a coffee. If you have time walk across the road to Raffles city or Chimjes where there are more options and it is generally cheaper
5
The food in this restaurant is fantastic. The staff are very attentive and are knowledgeable on what is on the menu. I must mention the name of one of the staff that was outstanding, his name is Shan, what a pleasure it was to be dining in this place, he was helpful and funny and very respectful. I hope the company can see the value in this staff member
4
We were here for family dinner. Very good spread including plenty of freshly shucked oysters . Plenty of salmon sashimi. Actually many other foods and desserts. I believe all must be delicious. This restaurant offers a buy one get one free. So we only pay for 4 people instead of 8. Service just ok.
5
Even though the spread I must say, is not as wide as some hotels. But the food quality is fresh. This is especially so for the oysters which are freshly shucked. The fresh raw food portions are very fresh and tasty. The desserts are also very tasty. Enjoyed our dinner there
2
Went to Cafe Mosaic for the Christmas Brunch. The food was extremely limited and the staff were very slow and un attentive. For a sold out brunch they only had one bar staff member getting drinks for the entire place. Took over 20 minutes to get food order. Probably the worst brunch in Singapore.
5
Delicate buffet just nice to fill your stomach. Won't cause you to be overeaten.
Nice ambience. Local delicacy, Indonesian gado gado, salad bar, ice-cream
No duplicated meat or fish with different taste. Example; 1 mutton, 1 beef, 1 fish, 1 seafood, 1 chicken.
3
and dinner buffet there and the choice of food are OK. The breakfast is included in the hotel rate so it is good. Nothing special. Would recommend not to eat there but the location of the hotel may force some patrons to eat there
2
Over price.
Limited selection
Taste so so
Keep the cash and go other restaurant.
The pic show 80%of cooked food
4
Breakfast choices are great and if you don't fancy them you can always order from the menu. Staff are friendly and helpful and always willing to assist you with any queries.
4
This is a place you look forward to every morning. The buffet breakfast spread gives you an array of international fare.
5
There is very much selection of buffet spread of food, from local, Japanese, seafood, western, desserts, salad, etc. I like the most are the crayfish, salmon & of course, the fresh oysters😋😘.
4
Both the buffet breakfast and the seafood buffet dinner at Café Mosaic were very good. Lots of fresh choices and the staff was excellent.
1
Tonight I had my dinner here with my Wife celebrating our pre Valentine's dinner. I got to tell you it's a big disappointment with this 1 for 1 deal at S$103!The seafood is not really fresh especially the mini lobster. It's not worth at all and not value for the type of quality of food being served that you paid for.I will not go back there again to this Cafe .... This is not a restaurant!!The rest is up to you to decide
4
A relaxing place for buffet lunch on a weekday. Their seafoods are fresh with prawns, mini lobsters, oysters, salmon, octopus and etc. Their mee rebus is really delicious. With other varieties of foods for you to choose from. The servics from their crew are good too!!
1
Amazing, that a hotel who struggle to keep their 5 stars, is not able to provide a descent dinner buffet. Especially for the price of $88++.Looks like nobody pays that price as hotel guests receive a 50% discount and various credit cards giving 1 fpr1 deals.I think it is still not worth it.No atmosphere. Noice young student crowd. Food very mediocre.Yes they serve sashimi and oysters but that's about it.Plenty of better choices in Singapor
5
The breakfast buffet is a feast. Weather you're looking got Asian, Western or continental, you have everything here. The juice is real, milk fresh, eggs can be cooked to order and tea and coffee abound. A great start to the day!
5
the cafe can be used for breakfast, lunch and dinner if you want it, great mix of food for all tastes, prices reasonable if you don't wish to face the local food outlets and want a quiet meal or snack.
3
too busy, too crowded, to cheap for such a great hotel. that's how I would summarize this café for the Carlton hotel.
3
Cafe Mosiac has a very clean and bright environment. Suitable for gathering with family and friends. As for the food, was rather disappointed with both the limited spread of food varieties as well as the food taste and quality. Frankly, if is not for the 1 for 1 promotion deal, the $88++ per pax is way over-priced. It is no where near any other places that charged similar, such as The Colony @ Ritz Carlton. All my other family members had similar disappointments as well, esp for a nice hotel with such nice ambience.
4
Enjoyed the evening with office colleagues. Restaurant ambiance was cozy and decent. Food variety was lesser compared to some of buffet places I have visited recently but it was tasty and fresh. I tried to sample various types of foods available. Loved the Sushi corner and Mutton masala. Desert corner was fairly generous with many variety to choose from. Special mention to the oyster counter, they were really fresh and juicy. I will be glad to visit the place agai
3
Went there for 1 for 1 buffet dinner of 6 pax. I thought there will be improvement in the foods being served. Almost a few years have not been there before and after extension.In term of the food spreads, there are not many varieties for $88 buffet with western, Japanese, south east asian foods. The best part is the desert served with bailey and red-bean drinks.$88 or $44 is not worth it
4
Dining at the Cafe Mosaic (Carlton Hotel) is a pleasant, unpretentious experience. The restaurant is brightly-lit, airy, with enough room to allow diners freedom of movement between food stations without fear of bottlenecks and congestion. The food selection is wide, ranging from local dishes such as rojak and mutton rendang to western staples such as roast beef. The cold station is particularly memorable with fresh vegetables for do-it-yourself salads, salmon/octopus sashimi, sushi, cold prawns/mussels and rarities such as cold jellyfish and crawfish. Most dishes are flavourful with the one disappointment being the prawn mee, which suffered from a bland soup base and lack of noodle variety. The big question for us was whether the hefty per-person price ($88) would have been worth it without the one-for-one promotion. Other options such as Lime (Park Hotel Pickering) and Triple Three (Mandarin Orchard) would be more than competitive
5
Ate the buffet dinner. It was good value being a 2 for 1 offer. It is usually $88++ per person which totals $103 but the special was for 2. We would not have visited if it was full price as too expensive. The food was delicious with plenty of variety. The cakes were so tasty. Water, tea and coffee included. $5 for unlimited soft drinks. Wait staff very efficient clearing the used dishes. Most staff had a friendly smile. Would recommend the special price buffet
4
It is a small buffet in terms of size but it has a fantastic spread of Asian and Western dishes. They have a delicious Coffee Cake definitely worth trying. The staff was very attentive. Recommend sitting by the windows towards the road side view. It is brighter and more spacious.
4
This is the Cafe Mosaic inside the Carlton Hotel in Singapore. The restaurant is clean and has a great variety of foods. Western travelers will find limited choices, particularly in breakfast meats. There is an omelette kiosk where you can have a made to order breakfast. Lots of pastries. Lots of fresh fruit. Many of the food choices are understandably oriented to oriental travelers who prefer noodles, soups or salads for breakfast....not my cup of tea, but tea is also available!Can be busy at times as most hotel guests have a promo breakfast option. I have eaten here many times and will continue to do so
4
This cafe in the Carlton hotel has a good breakfast buffet with a mix of western and asian foods. Eggs and omelets are cooked to order, which is nice. Overall good quality and good range of options.
2
Raw Oysters, Creative Sushi and good spread of local foods. Surprised to see Mee Rebus available. Very excited to see a huge spread of desserts including cakes, puddings, pastries and almost forgotten Pulot Itam.
If you enjoy local foods, this is Great.
3
Located in the Carlton Hotel..........provides a great breakfast. Other meals or OK. I really caters to hotel guests that do not want to venture out.

We were in Singapore to visit family and friends. We met with an old friend of ours for dinner and she suggested this Cafe, and we were happy to go along. On arrival, the cafe looked spacious and clean, and the deco was up-to-date. We sat and chatted for a few minutes, and we decided to get some food. Walking around, we found that there was no flow with the buffet layout and the menu. The seafood table had an ok selection with prawns, mussels, 'crayfish' (Australians call them yabbies). We didn't realise that there were oysters as it was on a different counter behind the seafood table (where the bar counter is). The western roast was together with pick-your-own-veggies stirfry section, and noodles soup section. There was sweet and sour pork but there was no steamed jasmine rice, just a turmeric basmati (not sure if there was an Indian curry). It was overall a very strange layout and a mismatched menu. Food tastes very ordinary ... nothing to write home about. But it was halfway through our meals when we realised that no one had come to ask us if we wanted to order any drinks. There were no juices at the buffet (if there were, they were probably hidden or not near the drinks station), just tea, coffee and iced water. This was when we flagged the waitress down for a drinks list. She stared blankly us, not knowing what we were asking for. My friend repeated her request... and the blank look continued and her eyes darted around the dining floor, trying to get help from her colleagues. My friend now decided to speak to her in Mandarin, which she now understood, but still don't know if they had a drinks list. So off she went to enquire. She came back with "no drinks list" in Mandarin, and nothing else to offer. When my friend asked for other options, she walked away and came back with another waiter who spoke English, and by now, my friend had already decided she wanted a glass of champagne. He responded "Just a glass of champagne? Do you want anything in it?" And that confused all of us... and when we asked him what he meant, he said "Do you want ice in it?"They finally came back with an offer of $30 for a glass of champagne, which my friend declined. And they explained that they had to get it from Gravity Bar (another restaurant outlet) and they don't serve champagne in Cafe Mosaic. And it was right about now that we found out through the finest prints on one of their table displays, that we can pay $5 for free flow of soft drinks. Why didn't anyone offer that to us all along? It was much later when we asked the Chinese waitress for something else when she did her stock-standard blank stare again. Carlton Hotel has to take a long hard look into their HR department for hiring non-English speaking staff in a Singapore hotel; or their F&B department for putting someone on the floor without proper training. Singapore is a very multicultural country, an international business and tourism hub. To have a hospitality staff who cannot understand basic English is unacceptable and can be very frustrating to visitors. And in case you are wondering, the buffet was $88++ per person. The prices are rather high for the quality of food we got, and the service we received
3
The table seats are quite packed. Breakfast wise -- not much choices. Coffee -- self service from coffee machine. Taste so so to me. They took away my food which I haven't even finish. But their omelette is not bad and the siu mai. They do serve some pork dishes
4
We went there on Wednesday using 1 free 1 credit card promotion.Food was nice. Staff refilled the food before the dish become empty. Salmon and oysters was very good. But not so much variety for other type of food. For 1 free 1 price is worthy to go. But for full price I may consider other place
4
I was staying at the hotel on business and visited this place for breakfast every day. spread is great so I did tend to get carried away on the 1st day but quickly overcame that. traditional Chinese/Singaporean fair, Malaysia, Western with breads and an omelet station, fresh fruits, juices, cereals and yogurts. this place has it al
3
Came here twice with my wife. We had the 1 for 1 deal since I'm a hotel guest at Carlton Hotel.Not so many varieties but for buffet, I always came for Oysters and Salmon so I'm content that they got both although the oysters doesn't taste that fresh.I love the durian pengat, was nice.Love the ambience of the restaurant and the service was great. The staff was attentive!Overall its was a good experience though
2
Took my family out for dinner this evening. For $88++ per head, I was expecting more than what this place had to offer.Canadian oysters were the highlight, they come in large.Roast beef was comparable to other cafes but nothing to shout about.The service staff were tip-top though, running around tables and ensuring that the tables were cleared quickly. Kudos to the team, they were the only ones who made anything make sense in that cafe tonight.Will I return again? Probably not, not even at half that price point. I was really looking forward to checking out this restaurant for the longest time. I'm sorry to say that I left disappointed and underwhelmed
2
Staff in this cafe are maybe new, but somewhat let down the quality of each facility in the Hotel. Would love to see them smile a little more and not treat guests like people they want to move out of the way. Hoping for a change next time
3
For the price, the spread provided was reasonable. Particularly enjoyed the prawn noodle soup & the salted egg bun. Was disappointed that the sashimi was just tako; no salmon or tuna.
5
We had a large group and the service was great. The selection and variety of dishes were great. Some attendees enjoyed being able to make local dishes to serve to us. We had both local and foreigh attendees and all enjoyed ourselves.
4
I'm not a good eater, But you've got to try the cakes and desserts. Quite a selection of delicious sweetness to choose from.
4
Nice food but be early to the sittings!! Unless you are into pedestrian traffic and queuing for a cup of self serve coffee.
3
Have eaten at this restaurant a few times and I have never had a meal that I would say was great. Presentation also seems to be lacking. I am of the opinion it seems more cafeteria style but the prices don't reflect that. Prices are high for what you get.
3
There is a Promotion of 1 for 1 for Some Credit Cards. The selection of food and quality of food is normal to me. Some of the Service Staff have abit of problem expressing themself and not able to provide you with the right information you need. However the Cafe did impress me with a very helpful and Cheerful chef, didn't manage to get his name. Was there for my wife birthday celebration, was looking around for a cake then saw this Chef who was walking around and helping dinners. Ask him if i could get a cake anywhere for my wife, he then ask me if i Pre-order the bithday cake. And i told him "NO", he told me not to worry and say he will get a cake for me. Of cos I did not asked him the price, and expect to pay for the cake. Got me a nice cake. When paying for the bill I realise it was a free cake
3
Breakfast is too rushed, with people almost running from one station to another. Need signs to ask people to slow down. It's a common complaint at Singapore buffets. Take your time - you won't starve ! Food generally flavourless - needs a bit of love. Noodles with flavour - please ? Is it too much to ask in Singapore ?
4
Two family of eight person attended a buffet lunch on sunday,10/1/16.We made reservation earlier. We had a variety of dishes,deserts,cakes,,soups and many other varieties of food..I liked the clams, fresh prawns, raw salmon, scallops and other fresh items on ice.The main courses were goods.We also had salmon wrap,which was nice to eat. Fruit juice were also available..It was worth having buffet lunch or dinner ata reasonable price
3
The title says it all actually. I was there for a Christmas buffet lunch with colleagues on a weekday. While it had a decent crowd, the food was only just ok - probably ok to get by. It's the Christmas season and any reputable restaurant/hotel would serve turkey or any type of ham, or perhaps even any type of roast just so that they can meet their halal requirements, but there was none at all. Pretty disappointing when reality doesn't meet up to expectations. Service was sub-par, average at best on some occassion
1
Service was good but food was mediocre at best. Variety was the worst among all the buffets I went. Even for buffets that are 1/2 the priced of these. Only thing of note was the craving station which only had 1 item : Roast lamb but it wasn't fantastic. For the price paid was expecting a better variety or quality of food. Wouldn't even recommend as there are other buffets which are far better for price paid
5
If it wasnt for the price, I would have eaten breakfast here everyday, it was fantastic, and a lot of variety
1
My 1st time visit to this place. Food was not tasty. Lack of choices, Salmon doesn't seem to be fresh.. Dessert was not tempting ... not worth the money for the price of $78++ For Sun to Thurs..Need lots of improvement on the menu
2
I am disappointed with the breakfast buffet spread and food quality. Everything looks like reheated frozen food. Coffee was also disappointing. Not recommended
3
Breakfast was very average, not a great deal of variety. Though most of the food was nice but not a high end buffet by any stretch.... It was also freezing cold in the restaurant which put me off eating there.
2
Lovely hotel, but go elsewhere to eat. The oysters were not fresh, and while the variety is plentiful, the quality was not worth the price.
4
Nice spread of buffet. Cold seafood, salmon n oysters. Enough of staff for service. Can be crowded on weekends n public holidays. Worth a visit.
4
Was invited to a special occasion - birthday and ROM celebration just last Friday night. I enjoyed the seafood selection of oysters, sashimi, prawns, crab salad and cooked food, and different ice cream flavours and durian pengat. Unfortunately, I did not have a big enough stomach to try all of the buffet items and just go for my kind of food. However, I did not enjoy the roasted lamb due to it's smell. Service wise was good as the waiting staff cleared our dirty plates promptly and gave us complimentary sliced cakes for the special occasion as mentioned above. We were fortunate to get window seats and hence able to display our own bought balloons without any issues. Thank you to the management and staff of CafÃ© Mosaic for your excellent service
4
We (six of us) had the 1 for 1 buffet dinner last Friday evening at Cafe Mosaic, Carlton Hotel. The buffet spread - pretty standard. There were 2 soups to start with - pumpkin soup and chinese sze chuan soup - both were tasty. For salad lovers, there was quite a handful of greens and the salad dressing for you to go with. We had the most were the sashimi - salmon! Delicious! They also served cold prawns, scallops and lots of oysters!! For the main course, there were braised duck (which was surprising nice!), chicken, fish, rice and fired mee tai mak. I also tried the mee rumbus. For those who like sweets stuffs can have the cakes and tarts, and also there was ice-cream!Don't miss out the durian cakes! Fast to go!Overall, a pleasant meal for us. For S$88++ for 2 pax, I think it's pretty ok. The waitresses were attentive and they were fast to clear your plates though.Do remember to inform them you are having the 1 for 1 buffet, under UOB and Citibank Credit Car
1
Do not know where to start. The "fresh" fish on the cold bar did not seem fresh. The oyster were very strong and the texture was not right. The prawns were bland and their texture was off as well. All the hot dishes I tried tasted basically the same and were extremely bland. The quality of the food in this restaurant comes no where near the price they charge. Stay away from this one
3
Whilst providing a very good selection of foods for breakfast and a wide selection of different types of food for the evening buffet (and good value with a buy one get one free for house guests), the service and the cost of the drinks leave a lot to be desired. A $95 mark up on a bottle of NZ Oyster Bay was a little excessive
5
Great selection of different foods. Catering for different cultural tastes and groups. The restaurant is situated in the foyer and easy to find a table as the staff is helpful.
2
Breakfast at the Mosaic is very limited with different options. You have you normal soup and omelette stations and thats as for as it goes. The choice for the buffet as extremely limited with bacon, scrambled eggs, tomatoes pickets and a few chinese style foods.
5
Buffet breakfast had a good selection of food which includes dim sum, american breakfast, fruits, eggs station and coffee/tea choices! Delicious and worth trying even though you might not be guests staying in the hotel!
2
I was forced to eat here due to work event, but would have much preferred to leave this overcrowded hotel restaurant to go to one of the great local restaurants. The buffet was not very fresh and there were no other options offered.
2
No, just no.
Lighting yuk
Range of food yuk
Drink prices yuk
Seafood ok
General buffet yuk
Range of salads was fruit
Food not replenished quickly enough
Let's the hotel down
4
Different experience & experiment for a Vegetarian person but all went really well. Soup & a vegi desh was excellent!
4
There is long que, I had to wait so long time, but the pastry is so tasty especially i like chef's an omelet.
3
Had a class dinner here tonight. The buffet spread looked decent though not overwhelming. Some of us had ala carte. The cooking was so-so ... the pasta was a little over-done ... but ok.The service wasn't great. Sometimes the staff were called but failed to respond. Or failed to seat us comfortably, asking us instead to squeeze at a table.Beer is US$11 a glass!! ... but its a hotel i guess.Overall, a decent place to meet and chat... but I wouldn't go there for the food
4
We had our buffet meals in this restaurant for a number of times. Earlier this year, we stayed in this hotel and had our breakfast in here. As breakfast is inclusive of the hotel package, I can say that the buffet spreads are quite acceptable. Good enough to fill your stomach in the morning.Just a few days ago, we decided to come back & had dinner here again to celebrate my birthday. Food choices are limited but not bad. They had fresh salmon & sushi, about 4 different types of cold salads next to the sushi, vegetable salads for your own creation, breads & rojak, their version of yong tau fu, about 5 - 6 cooked dishes, few fresh fruits, sliced cakes & pudding, and not to mention sea food (which I’m allergic too) – like clams, shells and very fresh-looking prawns. If you are a prawn/clams lover, this place is for you as they served heaps of this. Better to take advantage on their 1-for-1 promotion to make this more worth it

For breakfast and lunch, this is a great choice. It is on the corner of Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street, with the walls on the two sides almost entirely glass, giving the dining area a very open, light feel. The buffet choices are great. Best of all, they cater to people from many countries, so if you are in a business group, you can be sure there will be something to please everyone

very unhealthy selection of breakfast buffet.....sugar water for juices and diluted milk..staffs looks like they were short handed....very unorganized

I wasn't too impressed with their Chinese dishes, but their vegetable teppanyaki n raw seafood n salmon sashimi and sushi were pretty good! Oysters were small but nice. Ps - actually e service at e place was quite good. The only reason why it got a 3 instead was because the staff who pick up my call scoffed at my last minute reservation request - he said that it was full and didn't want to put me on wait til until I insisted on it!!
2
Im sure on a standard night, the buffet selection and quality is good enough, but tonight was not one of those nightsIt's Christmas - your website says you provide Christmas dinner - so a good idea would be to provide Christmas foodTurkey and ham does not constitute Christmas dinnerWhere the hell are the roast potatoes??? Was looking forward all day to munching on roasties and none to be seenNo roasted veg, no cranberry sauce (what you had signed as cranberry sauce could be a major violation of trade descriptions - try googling cranberry and see if it resembles diarrhea) and topping butternut squash with marshmallows is a good idea when??? If you're living Wonderland with Alice, maybe.....even then, I think the rabbit will say we've run out of timePlus points - salmon sashimi was good as were the rock lobstersThere are far far far better buffets out ther

On a weekday in December, the place got packed very very quickly which means long lines around the food display. Interesting choices and a wide variety of food make it a sumptuous place for a lunch buffet. But we had a fairly tough time communicating with the wait staff on very simple matters such as asking for water with no ice or a coke with glass and lemon slice. This is becoming a serious issue in Singapore in general where service jobs and visas related to getting those jobs have quickly morphed into a lot of young mainland Chinese temporary staff whose communication skills in English make for unnecessary difficult conversations over simple orders

I dined at Café Mosaic sometime back on a Saturday evening under the 1-for-1 buffet promotion. Initial prices per adult were approximately S$80++, which is quite a hefty price tag for a buffet with limited variety, so I would agree with most other reviewers that dining there is quite worthwhile only if you qualify for the 1-for-1 promotion. Do note that you need to pay with certain credit cards (can’t remember which, sorry!) to qualify for the promotion.As someone who went for the 1-for-1 buffet promotion, I personally felt that the buffet was not too shabby because at S$40++ per adult, you are getting freshly-shucked oysters, which are usually offered only if you’re going for buffets that charge S$70 or more per head. I thought the Japanese section was quite varied and worthwhile too; tasted some unique gunkanmaki like mango salad with caviar. For the salads, you can either choose from a selection of them or you can choose to whip up your own, be it a Caesar salad or Rojak (a local salad of fruits and vegetables mixed with shrimp paste). I felt that the mains suffered in terms of variety, but they were quite ok taste-wise. Desserts were quite ok despite not having a lot of variety; there were some fruits, bite-sized cakes and tarts, as well as ice cream. My favourite was the durian pengat. Only offered when in season, this inconspicuous dessert is made of durian pulp cooked with palm sugar and coconut milk. I found Mosaic’s one a little too sweet, but enjoyed it nonetheless =) Lastly, the buffet also comes with complimentary coffee and tea. The 1-for-1 dining promotion tends to draw quite a big crowd of locals, and the café is understaffed (I counted only 3-4 service staff in the entire restaurant), so do be patient! You might have to prompt a couple of times before they refill your water too

So, in lieu of the usual ala carte dinners of past years at French / Italian restaurants, it was my turn to plan for this year. I did some research and comparison, and decided to give Cafe Mosaic's Valentine's Buffet package a try. Cafe Mosaic is a contemporary cafe serving East-meets-West concept cuisine.Nicely decorated with sugar-carved figurines and balloons, resplendent of romantic red-and-pink themes suitable for Valentine's Day, we could see that we were not the only ones eager for celebration at this new cafe. Many well-dressed couples were already at the door, lining up when we got there at 6.30pm.We started with appetizers like salad and seafood and slowly worked our way through the Japanese delicacies and Chinese dimsum items. The spread had quite a few variety and assortments of items - typical buffet items. We dined to soft music playing in the background, and rather good service of the service crew who constantly came to check if we were good with our food etc.I could not resist desserts of course - and they had plenty of cakes and chocolates decorated in lovely heart-shaped themes as well. Needless to say, these were very sweet endearments and the perfect finish to a savoury dinner.For full review and photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/02/valentines-dinner-at-cafe-mosaic.htm

Went to Mosaic as colleague had a UOB card that entitled us to buy 1, get one free offer. The food on offer is average, seafood has oysters, mussels, prawns and salmon. Reasonable selection of hot food include lamb and beef. Service was okay.Simply at normal price of 78SGD++ its not good value compared to cheaper and far better places like 10 at Claymore and Carousel. If you are on a budget and can get the 1-4-1 offer then its okay

Brought my mum here for pre mother's day dinner. One of my few criterias was to go to a nice hotel buffet and a convenient location that was near to the train station. I found out that Cafe Mosaic had DBS credit card 1-for-1 promo, and we have never been here before, so I thought why not give it a try. They had a cooking station where you can order meats and/or noodles and have the chefs cook it for you on the spot. We gave that a miss and went for the buffet selection instead. They had cheese and crackers, cold seafood on ice (scallops, cooked prawns, sliced salmon etc), sushi selection,freshly shucked oysters. Hot food was rather limited, not so good for my partner who is a pescatarian and avoids the cold seafood section for fear of food contamination reasons. There were also chinese and western soup, assortment of dessert and cakes (not the loveliest dessert we've tried), limited ice cream flavours. Coffee and tea is complimentary, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages chargeable. I think what committed to memory was how slow the staff clear the tables, even after guests left. The manager/supervisor was seen taking pictures of the uncleared tables, it was quite funny to watch.Go if there's a promotion going on, otherwise, give this a miss as it was not very impressionable and for S$78++, the variety/food quality is not worth your buck

I have never reviewed a local restaurant or attraction previously. There is always a concern of being biased but I shall be objective.Firstly, the price. At SGD 78 per adult, there is very little bang for the buck. Local patrons with credit credit privileges enjoy a 1 for 1 dining. That brings it closer to true value and even then, somewhat overvalued. If you are from abroad, there are better choices like 10 at Claymore for that level of dining or if you want to splurge 10 bucks more, you can enjoy more at Triple Three or The Line. So foreign visitors, please give it a missFor local patrons, the service is fair. Some of the staff do try to clear the plates, etc. However, when it came to billing, a fresh waiter insisted on having the credit card first before offering the bill which is not usual practice. As it turned out, the bill was wrong and had to be voided.Worst o all there is no Parking Redemption which even the higher end places like Mandarin Hotel offer!As for the food, yes, the oysters were ok (btw, the issue of fresh oysters is a given), the E-u noodles were tasty and the Only cheesecake was good
4
While its true that the selection is pretty disappointing, the oysters are one of the freshest and tastiest you will find at any hotel chain international buffet. Each of us had at least twenty! The Japanese selection was decent and the fresh sashimi plate large enough so that you don't have to wait for them to refill often. Even if they needed to, it was done very promptly. Apart from desserts, everything else was so-so. Most of the hot buffet items you could probably find at a food court

Breakfast - lack of variety and service. Not worth the effort to get up in the morning for. You are better off going to Chijmes for Toastbox.
3
The food was excellent and were on time. I thoroughly enjoyed the eminence while the staff were attentive. I had to rush out after dinner and the staff were so kind to get me a cab waiting to take me.
4
Breakfast in Cafe Mosaic was good with lot of variety. The German Bee Pastry is the one major highlight to be tried out.
2
been to this cafe once, which form part of Carlton Hotel in Singapore.
Generally the location of this hotel is good, so do the environment of the cafe but the food, the variety, is really really poor which it may need to be improved.
4
Seafood was fresh.
Good international buffet.
Continental and Asian selections were extensive.
Service staff were attentive especially during breakfast.
4
Not the cheapest around but open at the right time if you happen to sleep in with jet lag.service very good and what we ordered was well presented and pretty good value
2
The food was very predictable after the first day, just a repeat of previous.Didn't enjoy our morning coffee as 'no fresh milk" ! Just artificial UHT or made up powdered like milk, not nice.Also as an English speaking person, I found communication quite difficult with some staff here, they didn't understand what was bring asked for - quite frustrating.TIP: If you decide to get an omelette cooked, wait and watch the cook make it DONT go away or else you will come back to an extremely overlooked egg moulded into a football shape. They need a few lessons
3
Had breakfast here each day as it had a reasonable selection of breakfast items. Generally had the buffet breakfast so could help myself to what I wanted. At S$33 it was a little on the expensive side.Food selection was good and the cooked food was tasty and did seem freshly prepared. Coffee was very good :-)The selection probably had something for everyone and the service was good
4
Recently visited with my family of 9, service was prompt and attentive. Food spread was reasonable, ingredients fresh (fresh oysters, salmon sashimi). Convenient place as Raffles City was diagonally across the hotel, parking on Sunday was per entry for SGD 6, so you can enjoy yourself leisurely. They had sculpted balloons for kids activities to keep them busy from 2pm (or 2.30?)
5
Such a nice ambiance and the table was made out of Mosaic, found it quite interesting. The foods were delicious. Staffs are soo polite and helpful. I asked for a lemon in my tea but I think they didn't have it at that time an they got me a lemon from somewhere else, so pleased with you. Hope to do more breakfasts with Cafe Mosaic someday soon
5
Great Food, excellent variety, and not pricey at all.
Dined there a couple of times uring my stay, always good and friendly staff.
4
We just had the buffet breakfast, but the food choices were extensive and good. Loved the coffee machine!
4
Good spread which will meet the needs of any travellor. One can also ask for special type of food catering to the geographical preferences which is made available with limited options.
5
Nicely cooked food and excellent service, loved the coffee, prices can be expensive for families suggest packages if available.
1
The staff was absolutely DISORGANIZED. They had no idea what tables were available..... to make it worse, when I went for a second serving at the buffet and left my full coffee cup at the table, the staff cleared it all away....

Myself and a small group of friends came here for the Festive buffet a couple days before Christmas. First of all, I had emailed them asking for a menu (there wasn't a full listing on the website) and they responded very quickly with the information. We decided to book it and made our reservation via email as well, again receiving a very quick and courteous reply. Considering I've had some less-than-desirable customer service experiences in Singapore, this was definitely a good start!The meal itself was great. There was a huge variety - turkey and ham with the fixings for us Westerners, which was cooked perfectly, as well as many delicious Asian dishes. The red snapper in particular stood out to me, and I was excited to see they had Singapore chili crab and Indian mutton curry, both which were good. Not amazing, but still pleasant. There were plenty of desserts to choose from, including an amazing Christmas stollen and some good Christmas pudding with brandy sauce. The ice cream station had an array of toppings to choose from, including fruit sauces, butterscotch, vanilla sauce and more, which kept us all happy :). There was a complimentary coffee/cappuccino machine as well. Everything was kept well-stocked and fresh throughout the night and kept me going back for more (I pretty much had to be rolled out the door!).The price was very reasonable, especially compared to other similar holiday buffets/set meals around Singapore. It was $78++, and we had the "cheap" table wine which was only $10/glass - good price, and still tasty. We got 15% off for using our DBS cards, so the total only came to $90. For a great, varied meal with nice ambience and good service, you could hardly ask for more! Will have to come back again outside of the holiday season sometime

It is easy to make a reservation at this place, with options such as phone and email. It is also situated in Carlton Hotel, which is next to Raffles City and City Hall MRT so your transportation options are pretty good.I made a reservation for 4 and we were seated in a section which seemed to me like it might have been a section for hotel guests since everyone else there did not seem local. Also, as I spied that the reservation list had a 100 pax reservation, they might have added tables and the section we were in required agile navigation to get to the food.Food wise, I think it is pretty decent for the price. There was nothing to complain about. I had the salmon skin, which was delightfully fried in oil that was not overused (you know when you taste the burnt oil?) and it was not soggy in oil. The salmon skin was large and crispy. I also had keropok (prawn crackers) which were properly drained of oil.The potato salad and honey roasted ham were good although I didn't quite like the salmon sashimi (I don't like raw food too much in the first place). They had a good amount of the popular seafood on display. 2 sections of salmon sashimi and 2 sections of raw oysters so you won't be all jammed up trying to fight for the same food. I think this is a great arrangement. They also had alot of other items which I did not eat (I'm rather picky on food) so YMMV.I also liked their chocolate log cake as the chocolate was really rich in flavour (some places use chocolate which taste really bland)

I was helping with our church organising a pre-Christmas lunch for our senior citizens - age: 50 to 96. There were 27 of us - 3 in 90s, 8 in 80s, 8 to 70s, 8 in 50s to 60s.For buffet setting, normally there is no serving but due to our aged group - somes are on walking sticks, the Restaurant Manager, Michelle Chong, has used her initiative to instruct her team to provide our senior citizens special service with a good smile. Our aunties and uncles are extremely happy.The foods are plentiful - they are healthy ones - not salty nor oily. Importantly, the foods are being replenished very prompting. Layout settings are very good - no congestion sighted.Price is very reasonable - probably one of the few in town!The restaurant ambience is very comfortable, spacious, clean, nice and last but least staff are friendly and serve with a BIG SMILE.!We highly recommended Cafe Mosaic for your gathering.Congratulations Michelle and team for the job well done !

Ate breakfast while staying at the Carlton. Over the weekend and in the mornings, it's busy, busy, busy but it was good. There is a broad selection of items to suit anyone's needs. There are lines in the morning - so that's something to be aware of if you're in a hurry - but it's all self serve so once you're seated it's up to you!
4
We had the breakfast buffet which was well spread which includes western to Asian food.There was a egg cooking counter and a Asian cooking counter which has Chicken noodle soup on my visit.Western buffet incl eggs, sausages, baked beans, pork bacon & hash brownsAsian buffet incl Bee Hoon, Nasi Lemak, Porridge, Dim sum.And during late afternoon. We tried the items from menu which we had the Club Sandwich & Mosaic Beef Burger which was both great! Served with salad n fries
2
I went to Cafe Mosiac for high tea buffet. The atmosphere and food did not give me a good impression. The pandan chicken did not have the aroma in it and the meat was hard. The cake was normal.
3
Food okay, but service aggressive towards solo travellers - tables cleared during visits to buffet. Too crowded and noisy at breakfast times.
4
Made to order omlets, excellent selection of pastries and fruit, very accommodating to Americans looking for a western breakfast.
5
I only went when I had a free breakfast with my room, but the food was amazing and I wish I could afford to go there for dinner.
5
Just try , you wont be disappointed with the level of services. Selections of foods is not much but the staff is friendly, helpful and food was great
5
Went for the dinner buffet at Cafe Mosaic (Carlton Hotel). There's quite a large variety of food ranging from cooked food to fresh seafood, grilled section, salad and even bread.
The seafood was really fresh and service was perfect. Service staffs were really friendly.
4
My wife and I were there for dinner on Last Sunday. Although the Cafe was very busy packed with diners, we were glad to see that the services provided by the staff were extremely fast and efficient. The replenishment of the food items was prompt and clearing of the used plates from the diner's table was also quick. A thumb up for the hard works provided by the staff

I brought my parents and family here for buffet dinner as an early celebration for Father's Day. This is our 2nd time here. However as compared to our first, this was a disappointment. My first impression when I called the reservations hotline was that nobody was manning the line. At first I couldn't get through. When I finally could get through, nobody picked up the phone. In the end, I dropped an email, hoping that I would get a reply. And they did.Not sure whether because there's a UOB credit card 1 for 1 promotion ongoing, so the spread was pathetic. The only seafood seen around was the sashimi, prawns and oysters, although the poster did show lobsters and crabs. We remembered the spread during our previous visit was so much better. I paid around $40 per person with the credit card promotion. Seriously I would definately not come back if this is the spread that we will be having! Despite saying this, the service standards of the staff were superb and the environment is pretty spacious. But it just wasn't sufficient
2
Gravity Bar (also at Carlton) had great reviews online for their afternoon tea. When I called for a booking, I was told this is not in Cafe Mosaic. Okay, no problem. I booked and went. It is *not* an afternoon tea. At least not if you think you'll get something like at the Fullerton or Shangrila Rose Veranda. It is simply a buffet lunch and not a very good buffet at that. The selection was very limited and the food was not very good. The only pros I can point out are:* Kids eat free with a paying adult (1 for 1)* They had kids activities, like making a cake box out of paper and baking mini muffins
3
We made a reservation for 1pm on a Sunday..... One of my friends arrived slightly earlier, but the lady at the reception refused to seat her yet.... What the?? When I arrived, we finally got the lady to bring us to our seats as there are 2 of us now.... Our dining experience was marred by this poor attitude....The restaurant was filled with screaming kids running around in the beginning....One had to look our for them when taking your food lest they bumped into you....Only at 2pm when the crowd starts to thin, we finally had some peace and quiet.....The spread was decent, plates were cleared quite quickly, and water refilled promptly..... No fault found with the serving staff....I cannot really remember eating anything exceptionally good.... but I guess that's the situation with most buffets here...
4
The waiting staff were friendly and attentive at dinner plus also for breakfast. Breakfast had a very good range and selection of different food choices.
5
Fantastic buffet dinner - great variety, fresh seafood and amazing desserts. Breakfast was also very good.
4
Breakfast Buffet serves Asian & Western guests. I could get my croissant as well as a chinese rice congee or a bee hoon. Coffee & cakes in afternoon are delicious. Price is ok - Singapore Hotel standard....
5
The choices of food were a lot. They ranged from Western food, Chinese and Indian type food. They offer a lot of tea choices as well.
3
Not sure about other meals but a good breakfast selection and reasonable service
4
While I was not very impressed with the breakfast buffet at Cafe Mosaic, lunch was a different matter. After a lap around the food, I could see that there were a lot of good choices and that I would ahve to pace myself. First, to the seafood: an excellent array of king prawns, mussels, salmon sashimi and various temaki sushi. there were also some good salads, including a delicious Thai beef salad. Then to the mains. I was delighted to find a spicy stingray dish on offer, as well as some really good fish dishes. The only disappointing dish I has was the Thai Duck red curry - while the taste was ok, it was not a red curry. In fact the closest the dish ever came to Thailand would have been New Zealand.While I didn't have dessert, they all looked appetizing. But then, don't buffet desserts always look great
5
I just went for Dinner with my wife on the last day of March, I've heard about this place from friends, but have no chance to visit there, so I decide to bring my wife to give it a try.The place was newly renovated recently, the envoiment was very nice and quite when we reach there, the Staff was very polite and seat us quickly, the foods was very fresh(which is very important), and the display was clearly seen, the varity of foods was alot.We'd a very nice dinning experience and would come again
3
Seating is quick and reception okay. Location was quite empty when I visited, giving each table also a little bit privacy.Service (asking for drinks, cleaning the plates) is attentive. We tried the buffet and found the food of good quality. Empty bowls are refilled quickly and you have a sufficient collection of starters, main course, etc
4
We had buffet dinner and breakfast here. The food was very good with a good variety of seafood and other dishes for dinner. The food was fresh and good quality. The Breakfast buffet had a good selection of food from western to Asian. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the service was equally as good. Overall a good buffet resteraunt.

AmbienceThe moment you think Carlton Hotel - 4/5 stars hotel.But to my horror the cafe isn't 4/5 stars standard. My boyfriend commented: "How come its not carpet floor and the flooring looks like as we're in coffee shop." The cafe is spacious but very noisy, really like dining in coffee shop. FoodI doubt it's post xmas feast. All the hot dishes are chinese food which my mum can cook for me too! I expect to see potato gratin, mushroom quiche, mushroom soup, lasagna, roast turkey, more westernize style. I see none, is all braised, steamed, which i do not like.Cold dishes, not much variety but taste not so bad.Deep fried section, oinon rings and tempura prawns only. Perhaps can add few more items like wedges, prawn dumpling, soft shell crab, etc.Seafood section, mussels, cockles, lala, shellfish can cook in 4 diff types of sauces.Carve section, pork knuckle, beef, honey baked ham. I tried the honey baked ham, disappointed!Dessert section, mango cake, mango pudding, strawberry shortcake, tiramisu and some tiny cakes. I like e creme brulee!ServiceAttentive and friendly servers (
