Decent enough atmosphere but odd way of serving, interrupting your order to serve other customers!? Also said they had no Cider but there were cases of it at the side!?

The three of us met here a couple of times. It is very convenient to the lift etc. Staffed by friendly efficient people with a smile and friendly disposition. Range of drinks seemed good and some free nuts etc available.

Only one bar staff to cater for thirsty guests. Wait times for drinks is a bit long especially if people are ordering cocktails.

One thing I noticed while in SIN was that not all restaurants had cocktail options, so it was nice that the bar at the hotel did, and plenty of options to choose from. Has a cool old world pup vibe.

great staff you must try the bars own version of the famous Singapore sling, delicious and served in a novel way. The bar is not huge and offers a comfortable cosy atmosphere.

Very good range of premium spirits and decent happy hour for house wines, beers and spirits if you don't feel like splashing out.

A relatively small, cosy pub adjacent to Jen Tanglin. Nice to have a drink after a long day and chill out a bit. Very kind service and the beer is seriously frosty!

It is an OK bar if you are staying at the hotel. It is situated within the Hotel Jen Tanglin. The staff are friendly, and drinks are ok. But there's really no reason to seek out the bar, unless you are staying at the hotel. There is no view, nothing special about the bar, etc. It is rather small for the size of the hotel. But - if you are at the hotel and want to grab a drink - it is good

Situated inside the hotel, again lovely little bar, it made me sad that there is not a lot of people know about it and pass it while going through the hotel, the situation of it is good and again same floor as the shopping Mall, but needs some advertising and maybe a smoke room attached to it as this is the only downfall, you do have to go outside into the main entrance to have a smoke, but the staff are good and they will keep an eye on your drinks, nice little bit of music would also be good as there was a screen with repeat of sporting oops, we managed to watch these several times when we came in, enjoyed the popcorn every time we ordered drinks and again the staff in the bar was polite and very well mannered.Thank you guys, we will definitely pop in for a few drinks next time to see you all.

One the second floor of the hotel Jen Tanglin. I was stopping there and it was a good place to go in for a swift one on the way back from the office. There are a couple of TV's with the news on. If you are from Britain you may want to take a deep breath before looking at the prices though
