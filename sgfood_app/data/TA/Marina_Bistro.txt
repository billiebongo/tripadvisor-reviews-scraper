The restaurant overlooked the marina and offers one of the best views. Was there for early dinner and enjoyed the spectacular sunset view. Food is definitely above average and service is adequate.

A good place to chill, enjoy food and drinks, chat with your friends or family while over looking the Marina. Across the water is Malaysia.

The food here is pretty decent. The ambiance is very casual and it's really relaxing as you sit back, enjoy the sea breeze while overlooking the marina at the same time.I usually eat here when driving to or from Malaysia when using the Second Link. It's really convenient as it is just minutes away from the Simgapore Immigration

I have been coming to this place for years. The food does not change much and it has its own value of being a constant but they keep experimenting with table servicing which is moving from bad to worse. In old good time it was a normal waiter. Then it was replaced with a menu and a beeper. Then iPad came however still requiring a waiter to key in a secret code to confirm the order. In the end, you have to go and pay at the counter. In either case, I have to wait for a quite long time till my food is prepared. Well. The place is nice with a great view, food is ok, but the table service is “buy it or leave it”.

They served good sea food menus and you can enjoy your meal with a nice view of the sea and luxurious sail boats and cruisers. Just beside, is the Raffles Marina Hotel swimming pools. You can order a drink (fruity, carbonated, alcohol beverages) and enjoy them at the Bistro or by the swimming pool. Good breakfast in the morning. They also cater to room service. Staff was friendly and offers good suggestion for their everyday specials

I was suggested to came here by my friends in Singapore while on a transit on my way to Bali. Fairly priced, delicious food, and refreshing drinks. But what catch my breath is the Amazing and romantic view! Dine in their deck and overlook the boats and sunset. I will definitely come back

Business was brisk during lunchtime on Friday. We ordered seafood alio olio pastas, wagyu ribeye medium rare & stirfry "shan yao" with vegetables.The waiter was lazy & reluctant to walk over when serving our food. There were only 3 of us but he stood at the same corner of the table which was not occupied & passed the plates of food to me & my guests, expecting us to reach out & receive our own plates. He had to be told to serve the stirfry vegetables not on the empty corner but at the centre of the table! The steak was overcooked (medium well) & looked like mass production from a foodcourt. The pasta was lukewarm & did not impress with overcooked seafood. The stirfry was fairly tasty but coated with a gluey layer of starch! There was flies buzzing around our food which was most annoying & unhygienic!We wanted to order ice cream on our way to the cashier but we were told to pay for our steak & pasta first before we could sit down again to eat our ice cream. We were clearly not impressed & decided not to order dessert

If you want to go for lunch with customers in the Tuas area, you often end up in a mall.This place is well located, easy to reach and has some nice atmosphere and viewsFood is ok, don't expect fancy things. Just some western and asian choices.Staff can improve their speed, or have more of them as the place gets quite busy at peak hours

Food was medicore, only nasi bryani was ok, pizza waa miserable at 11+ (special price for weeekend), pork chop was so tough my fingers ached after slicing, sandwich acceptable, mushroom soup passable. Spent $76++ ON THIS MEAL! Realised the surcharge was 15%!! On top of that another 7% gst. That's quite ridiculous, and the cashier claimed it's been in their booklet which they kept in their own counter for many years?!!? So who can have access to read it? I think they shld have advised the customers when they are seated if they were not members, the surcharge is 15% more! So effectively, for members, no discount, for non members, an extra 15%! Is this a good policy to entice members? Definitely not

Always enjoy my meals here, be it lunch or dinner. The price are not ex and nice view of the yachts and sea during your meals. During evening time, beautiful sunset in front of you.

Always friendly people and a place where kids play on the grass while you enjoy good food while looking over the yachs to the sunset..

Sure, the Indian food is decent and there's not much else in the neighborhood; however, the service staff are incompetent. First of all, my wife and I were waiting in the members queue to place our order while the guy behind the register took TWO newly arrived people from the non-member queue. When I pointed this out he said "oh sorry, I didn't see you" - but one would literally have to be blind not to see us. Then, I left my wife to complete the transaction (because I was so disgusted by the stupidity) and the other lady processing the order asked "is this your card?" In an accusatory voice - referring to my wife's membership card that HAS HER PICTURE ON IT. The only explanation is a complete lack of training

Firstly, the location may be very far from the city (It is near the second link bridge crossing over to Johor), but the trip would be all worth it just for the views. Situated at Raffles Marina, yachts and boats docked, with a lighthouse at the wharf, and good view of the sunset, it would all be worth the trip.The place is homey and relaxing, but could get really crowded during peak hours. The wait staff are nice and friendly, suggests their bestsellers, and they serve water free of charge.The food is good. Very nicely prepared. I ordered the Lamb Biriyani. It is not bad, the meat is very tender that you can easily remove the meat from the bone just by using a fork. The curry, chutney, and coriander sauce are nicely flavored too. It is actually quite a good deal for its price. Other items on the menu may probably be a bit overpriced, but for the Lamb, it is actually quite cheap compared to other restaurants that offer lamb. They got lots of options to choose on the menu. There are local favorites, and even vegetarian options.The only downside that I could say about this review is that the orders took so long before it is served. But other than that, everything else is good

Went this place with couple of friends. Make sure you visit their before the noon. After that it would be very crowded. Had indian foods and it was very good and the view from the resaturant is very nice. There were so many yachts at the jetty

Located at the border of Singapore-Johor bahru Malaysia, combination of sea view with boats and yachts are so beautiful. Food variety is quite good, from Asian food to western food, everything is available for your taste. My favourite appetizer is fried seafood, so crunchy and tasty!Tips: during lunch time, you must come before 12 PM, otherwise you will be awaiting for some time to be seated

Ok so 15 minutes after ordering, the friendly but twitty waitress tells me no chicken masala. Lamb it is. In due course Im delivered... chicken masala (huh??) minus the naan bread side order. "But you changed your order" protests Twitty. Several mouthfuls in Nerdy the cleanup hand asks me if Im finished because they need to close now. No.does it look like it? About half way thru the ordeal my bill arrives via a new waiter sporting an expectant look. Sigh. Milliseconds after the final swallow they're back for the money. Oops. Im charged the extra 3.50 for lamb and 3.80 for naan bread. Food was good though..

The Restaurant located at the Western Tip of Singapore, adjacent to the Second Link custom connecting Singapore and Malaysia... near the end of the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). It served western and oriental local foods. Usually , I visited with customers during lunch hour. The price is getting expensive and always crowded. Usually, I took local food like Chicken rice , Laksa or fish and chips. Food is nice. The environment also very nice

The view of the marina on a nice sunny day is nice and relaxing. It is out of the city main circuit, reachable only by car or taxi.The food is ok, During weekdays , lunch time is busy and the service may take long than expected.Local and malay food is ok. Worthwhile if you are around on business in the very extreme west of the island

My husband wanted to take me to Marina Bistro for lunch while in Singapore. He has been here many times before while in Singapore on business. It is a little out of the way as there are no MRT stations close, but the cost of a taxi in Singapore is not that expensive. You can get the MRT to Joo Koon on the Green Line then a taxi to Raffles Country Club and Marina. There was a huge selection on the menu which would suit all palates. Our waiter was quick to arrange our drink orders even though he got my husband's order wrong but that could have just been a language problem and he misunderstood. No problem for them to correct the mistake. We relaxed for awhile having our drinks before ordering our food and to tell you the truth could not make up our minds. I decided on chicken curry. The meals arrived quite quickly and the serving was more than enough. I have read with other reviews that the food was ok and the service was poor, but on the day we were there, although they seemed busy with customers I could not complain about the service. I could not fault the meals at all. In fact I would have loved to go back and try some of the others on the menu. The prices were also very reasonable. Unfortunately this day it rained and my photos were not the best. It is well worth the trip for the views and the food
