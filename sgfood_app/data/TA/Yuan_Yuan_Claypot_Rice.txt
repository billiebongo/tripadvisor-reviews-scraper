Superb claypot with fresh chicken marinated daily. Do expect a 30minutes wait on busy days. Serving is not that big for a $10 claypot not enough for 2 teenagers.

Great traditional claypot rice that's cooked using charcoal. Excellent flavour and taste. Good portion and value too. We had one that served 3 persons and each one of us had 2 full bowls of it and it's only for $15!

There are a few claypot rice place near our home but this is the best. We had this for dinner tonight with the rice as our staple while we added a few other items from other stalls. Be prepared to wait around 30 minutes or more if its a Sat or Sun evening. They are very popular. They add the salted fish chucks into the dish and sometimes when we find it and sink our teeth into it - oooh, its really yummy. Its like hitting the jackpot. The stall is generous with its ingredients. Owner and family and helpers are friendly. The second generation (daughter) helping out also speaks English and is also very friendly and helpful. BTW, we added a photo of how a packed rice looks like. All the rice and ingredients are stirred with black sauce and oil and then emptied into a plastic sheet lined paper box. Ready to go..

It has been quite some time that I last had the claypot rice from this stall, which is located at Brickworks Food Centre or more popularly known as ABC Market.One recent evening on a Saturday, I had a craving for claypot rice and this stall came to mind. I prompt drove over with my family and ordered Claypot Chicken Rice for 3 pax (which costs $15). I also asked for additional ingredients (which was an additional $5). The stall also has on offer steamed soups. By the time I was there, only the Herbal Chicken Soup was available. So I took it. It costs $5. The total cost of my meal was $25. As it was Saturday dinner time, the wait for my claypot rice to be cooked and ready was 1 hour 20 minutes.The claypot rice is cooked over a charcoal fire and it has a nice smoky taste. The chicken pieces were well-marinated and tasty. In it were also Chinese sausage, liver sausage and salted fish. When the rice reached my table, the lid was removed and I could see white vapour coming from the sides of the claypot from the inside. The white vapour is smoky and the rice has a nice ‘charocal-smoked’ flavour.For the herbal chicken soup, there was a whole chicken leg (drumstick and thigh) in it. It’s flavourful with the infusion of the herbs and the chicken is nice and tender. I have absolutely no regrets ordering this. It’s good!The wait was long, but it was all worth it. I had huge satisfaction after the meal. This is definitely one of the best claypot chicken rice I have eaten in a long time, and this stall ranks high in my books.Highly recommended
