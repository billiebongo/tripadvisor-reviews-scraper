Cosy and nice ice cream with a friendly service to match. The car park is just behind the restaurant. Located near to a coffee shop and the hawker centre!

They have ice creams with really unique flavors and the uncle manning the shop is really friendly and approachable too! Thumbs up!

Nice cosy place. Makes their own ice cream and has plenty of unique flavours such as durian ( with paste topping!) , kueh lapis, cranberry soursop.... Good stuff, very reasonable price.

Their orange ice cream with waffles (weird combo, i know) is really good. Their other flavors of ice cream are really good as well. Best time to go would be in the afternoon where the shop will be quiet and peaceful

The ice cream is smooth and nice. We love the X durian, Avocado and Soursop flavour. Check out the offer in store.

Was quite surprised that the small and cosy ice cream cafe was operated single handled by the boss himself! Ice cream was nice and price is affordable! Will definitely recommend others to visit. :)

The ice cream is smooth and coupled with the homely decor in a quiet neighborhood makes this a great place to chill. On certain days, they even offer ice cream buffet from 3-5pm. The man at the counter (presumably the chef) is friendly to regulars but to us first timer, seem aloof.
