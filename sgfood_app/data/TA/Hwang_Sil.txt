This is a Korean Chinese restaurant which serve varieties of Food.
Highly recommend to try their Gan Jjajangmyeon & Jjamppung (Seafood Noodles)

Customers mostly are Korean. Quite authentic taste. Ma po tofu was very tasty. Jajang noodle was good just the noodle a bit too hard to chew. Price was quite steep considering we only ordered 3 dishes and cost us $93.

The new owners took over and renovated the previous Jung Hwa Gak around last year. Initially the food wasn't too good. But we tried it again recently and boy what a difference! Everything turned out much better. The fried and steamed mandu were excellent, and the sweet sour pork was to die for. Noodles were good and i was only slightly disappointed in the jellyfish salad which was better in Jung Hwa Gak. Will still consider this new joint a worthy replacement and my vote for the best korean chinese restaurant in singapore now.

this is a very nice place - clean and near the maxwell market and tanjong pagar mrt. there were i think only 3 or 4 staff but they are so efficient. the side dishes are really nice. the choices on the menu are extensive. but we took the set menu for 3 persons which comprises of 2 noodles and 2 dishes - a sweet and sour pork which is a must order dish - lovely pieces of fried pork with the dipping sauce in a bowl. loved the noodles - one was a seafood soup and the other was the traditional one. the tea is really nice too. the set was $55. good place to talk as well - not too noisy. i would return to try the other dishes

The jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk here were delicious and authentic. staff here are korean chinese and service is good. They were patient with my table even when we hadnt ordered anything for about 15-20 mins as we were still waiting for a friend.Only bad thing i can say is that it is expensive. we each had a jjajangmyeon and shared a large tangsuyuk and it was nearly $30 per person. Isnt jjajangmyeon supposed to be cheap, delivery food in korea? I would still come back, but maybe just for special occasions. A good alternative place to dine instead of the usual Korean BBQ or soup/stew

We came here for lunch and was a little late - around 2pm and the though the restaurant said it closes between 2:30-5:30pm, it accepted us and also some others that came later. So, service is obviously good. We noted a continuous stream of Korean couples and expats with family coming in even after us. As a Korean Chinese restaurant, its offer is somewhat different from Korean restaurants. We took a set for S$55 of 4 dishes (incl 2 noodles) that could more than fill two person up! So servings are generous though the side dishes are a little less varied compared to some other places. The noodles tasted heavenly and the sweet and sour pork is really something to try - its very different from the Chinese version!She must had been the lady boss of the restaurant and we spoke quite a bit after the meal. She recommends that we book if coming for dinner. Very friendly people
