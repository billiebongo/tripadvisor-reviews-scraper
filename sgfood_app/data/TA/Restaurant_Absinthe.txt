Restaurant is closed for business. No re opening date or what soever on the door.
It even looks like all the tables and chairs are not anymore in the restaurant. It won't open for good anymore

Food is reasonably good and staff is very friendly and approachable! I would recommend to visit the place when you want to experience French cuisine
5
Great value for money french cuisine with generous portions. The environment is also cosy with friendly service.

We were dragged out after a first morning of exploring Singapore. Absinthe was just the right stop! Not inexpensive, but the fixed price lunch was well priced for what we got. Particularly delicious mushroom soup. The rose wine was very nice.
5
Absinthe was our choice of restaurant on our first night in Singapore, having previously had a wonderful, romantic meal there on our last visit. Situated on Boat Quay, we choose to dine al fresco which provided an endless parade of entertainment with boats full of tourists chugging up the river enjoying the sights and sounds of Singapore. The service is friendly and professional, the drinks list good and the food excellent, particularly the lobster bisque. We both had fish for mains and were impressed with the quality and freshness of the meal. A little bit of Paris with an Asian twist and well worth finding, any taxi driver can direct you to Boat Quay
1
Unbelievably poor service, 40 mins for a glass of wine. 1hr+ to receive our mains and the restaurant was only a third full. Food was ordinary, nothing special, although the prices were not reflective of the standard of the food. Should be substantially cheaper given the quality.Would not go back
3
The view from the terrace is great. But food is pretty common for the price ( we took the cod and the seabass). Portion are small, as if we were in a real french gastronomic restaurant, which is far from the case. But the main issue is that the service is really slow. 45 minutes to get our meals, without getting one piece of bread to be patient. 30 minutes to get the dessert. Maybe we were unlucky this evening.staff is polite
5
Due to the size of the group, 14 people, we had our own room on the 3rd floor. Most of us had the 3 Course Set Lunch at $28++. There were 3 choices each for Appetizers, Mains and Desserts. Most of us had Soup of the day that was mushroom soup, while some had Pork Terrine and others had Tuna Rillette. For Mains the choices were Grilled Sea-bass filet, Roast Chicken and Truffle Mushroom Tagliatelle. Dessrts were Dessert of the Day - Cake and Cream, Sorbet with Seasonal Fruits or Cheese (Top up $10++). They had options for Grilled Beef rib eye and Burger at $24++ each. They is even option for a bottle of Rose at $38++
4
I go there everyday for Lunch when I visit Singapore every lunch. Not nouvelle cuisine, quality French food with good taste and confortable atmosphere. A great location with also a beautiful terrasse overlooking the water and the Fullerton hotel in the background. Friendly service with staff knowing their job very well. A great and friendly Manager Vincent... la Classe

After walking along crowded Boat Quay on a Friday evening, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised to find the area outside the restaurant to be relatively quiet. The restaurant is on the 2nd level, there was only one other couple there, and very quiet, which was great for us. We find the ambience of the restaurant very pleasant, cozy and very cool compared to the humid warm temperature outside. The manager from Monte Carlo was very cheerful, very professional and good without being intrusive.My wife had foie gras and duck confit, I had the fresh oysters, beef cheek. We ordered a bottle of Cote du Rhone to go with the food, and I had some cheese to finish the wine with. The food was excellent, my wife commented the foie gras was exquisite and the duck confit superb with the wine. The oyster I had was just OK, nothing to shout about, but the braised beef cheek was very "melts in the mouth" tender and delicious, and went very well with the wine. We finished with coffee and shared the pear crumble. It was overall a very pleasant evening, we spent chatting and talking in a very nice, quiet and cozy setting, and not having to fight with crowd, the noise and the heat, the restaurant reminded us of our holiday in southern France many many years ago. The bill was not the cheapest, but to me, it was well worth it; my wife was very happy and so was I.
4
Location was perfect...chose to sit outdoors. Menu ideal although entree portions could have been 15% larger.
4
Nice ambience. Good variety of selection. Good for business lunches as well as private talks with friends.
5
Not our first visit and we always liked the ambiance and service. Will return soon for small gathering or celebration.
5
Don't miss this gem . . . French Cuisine at it's best. They also have daily specials (loose page accompanying the menu). Be sure to sit outside . . . you can watch the water boats all night long sipping wine . . . ahhhhhhhh
5
Nice evening out with excellent food, wine and service by the river with a great view on MBS, everything was just perfect .
2
Food standard has dropped. Food quality and taste are just disappointing. Unlikely to revisit or recommend to friends.
4
it's the first that we came for a dinner and it was a nice surprice. The pricing is very fair (even better than most of the french restaraunt (overpriced in Singapore). Real french traditional good food (no fusion or trendy).Very good choice of starter and main course. The only negative point is the wine list (too limited choice for a bottle below 100 SGD) but if you want to spend more it's a very good value for money. For sure We will come back for dinner (as for the lunch / lunch during the week is very inexpensive
5
We stumbled on this restaurant when we were walking around looking for a dinner venue and I am glad we discovered this restaurant. We sat outdoors as the weather was pleasant and the view over the river beautiful. The services was outstanding and head waiter Mario was fabulous. He was always there when you needed and friendly.The food was also excellent. Both my husband and I had fish - I had the sea bass and my husband had the cod. Both were delicately cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. We also had a desert recommended by Mario which was a perfect way to end the meal.We enjoyed the meal so much that we returned again a couple of nights later. This time there were 4 of us and again the food and service was excellent. Compliments to the chef and team as it made our evening very enjoyable
3
The restaurant looks really fancy - waiters are all dressed up and the decor suggests top level dining. Unfortunately the food quality was a bit disappointing. Maybe because it was late (we were the last guests), but maybe it's just what it is. Oysters & Champagne with river view were a great start, but the main course was disappointing - especially tartare, which tasted like canned corned beef or cat food. If you order something else, you'll spare yourself a disappointment
4
The food was really good, and the staff was able to make excellent recommendations. We had the pan-fried foie gras, mushroom soup and lobster bisque, wild mushroom risotto, seabass, wagyu beef cheeks, and striploin. Desserts of banana crumble and souffle were also very good! Definitely will come back again
5
This restaurant has a fine setting on the quayside, a perfect place for my birthday.The food was delicious as you would expect from a good quality french restaurant. A very enjoyable night was had by all.
5
Food was excellent. Good value. Steak Tartare was delicious. Burrata a must try. Will definitely go back.
4
On a week night we easily found a table right overlooking the bay. Our day's special of scallops with white asparagus and chorizo was excellent. Not even terribly expensive for Singapore. Creme brûlée up to the standards of Paris.
5
Excellent French food from VERY French (in a good way...) chef and staff.
Can also sit out on Boat Quay for a drink - with a selection of Absinthe - by far the most up-market place there.
4
Good French food, good ambiance and very good value for the set lunch. Only complaint is that waiters are not always present to be called. Will return there for sure.
5
My husband and I enjoyed a very pleasant evening at Absinthe. The staff were very attentive, the food delicious and the wine we chose good value.
3
Hard to fault the food that came, but to wait an hour for a main course off a set menu is simply unacceptable. Had to cancel the cheesE desert. Somewhere for a two hour lunch of long afternoon.
5
I'd not revisited Absinthe for years -- not since they moved to Boat Quay whenever that was. I used to really love the old place when I lived in Singapore, and used it a lot for both lunches and dinners.This visit was a reunion of sorts -- about 10 of us, all quite particular and demanding, I would say. The staff handled it all brilliantly and with enthusiasm -- very commendable indeed.The food was excellent, fresh, well presented, and perfectly portioned . The wine list is perfectly adequate for the job -- and what we drank was enjoyable. I wasn't in charge of the wine, so no idea what it cost, but I suspect a fair price for what it was. Although I don't really like Boat Quay and its touristy image, I must say that sitting outside by the river was exceptionally pleasant (and smoker-friendly).Can't wait for my next visit, actuall
2
i had high expectations but was let down. The Food wait staff are discriminatory and impolite. All guests should be treated equally and shown courtesy. I was surprised I had food on the table given that in the whole time I was there, never once did the wait staff asked me what I wanted to eat. My husband and I ate our average meal and left. The only consolation was the drinks wait staff was nice
5
We usually bring overseas visitors to this restaurant, as the food and service are always high standard. The location by the river means there is usually a breeze to keep it cool while dining outside. The beef cheeks are my favorite menu item, all the desserts are great and the staff always helpful in selecting a sensibly priced wine to complement the meal. They are also very responsive to special requests made when you have a special occasion
4
The terrace is very well located along the Singapore river so good view on the financial district and Marina Bay Sands
Food is good but not amazing
4
The restaurant very nearby to the main attraction of singapore their food was superb and the service was efficient . I highly recommend this restaurant.
2
Good service, food was poor. Salmon tartare tasteless. Both ordered sirloin, when it arrived looked like we only got half the steak (cut in half). Sent it back. Then got an intact steak but about a centimetre thick - is this restaurant trying to cut costs? Really disappointing
2
Service if pretty goodStarter (duck pate) is ok, nothing fantastic.Cheese ravioli in basil soup, the presentation of food doesn't look appetising, taste is nothing to shout about.The main course - cod was horrible (not fresh, can taste of the "frozen" and the fish is tasteless. The combination of the mashed potato and cod doesn't goes well.Dessert is goo
5
Three generations (6 to 70 years) for a dinner - and what a nice experience.We got a table outside - front row river view. A pleasant breeze kept the temperature where we wanted it.The table of six had escargots (strange they don't have a single plate for 12 escargots, but only 6) and gambas with chorizo. Approved by all around the table :-) For main course we had lamb, beef cheeks, rabbit and the youngest had a hamburger. Everybody completed their portions 100% (which is unusual for the youngest, not so much for the others.)Plenty of other choices to pick from if need be.The portions were perfectly sized and served, the taste was excellent and the service good - attentive, but not hovering over the table. Allowing time to talk and digest in between dishes. Just perfect. Really good!! Thank you for a great evening!We will be back!
2
Menu looked like a good range of impressive french food. But the oysters and the scallop carpaccio tasted bland and below average. I had the duck confit as a main and it was extremely dry. My partner had the mushroom risotto and it was grainy and undercooked. I will not be back.
2
Overall, this is the third time we've been here. Would I go back now? Sadly probably not. Not when you're paying good money. I'd go to the sibling restaurant Osso or other venues for a special dinner out. Details of our most recent visit below....We booked for my visiting father-in-laws' birthday dinner on a Saturday night and got the kids to bed early.The service started out fantastically and our water was top notch - as expected and from past visits (this is a high end restaurant after all). It was a bit disappointed to be told that their signature dish (Chateabriand - Tenderloin) was sold out given we had an 8pm seating, but they have great food so we ordered other items.Entrees we had were oysters, pan fried foe grais, prawns and chorizo and the lime tartar scallops. All were great: scallops were excellent and the prawns the hands down winner.Things started to go down hill after the entree.... For mains we ordered duck leg confit, beef cheek x2, and L'Entrecote. After a long wait my main arrived (duck confit)... 10 mins passed. No other dishes. Finally after some waiter conferring in the back ground our waiter came over, apologised profusely that there had been a mistake, and took it away. Waiting, waiting, waiting. 25 mins later they finally all came out.... All were luke-warm, at best. The food flavours were great but they were semi cold. We didn't bother to complain as all we feared was another 30min wait.Wait staff seemed to disappear. I ended up topping up the wine for all myself. We finished our mains and the plates sat empty in front of us for over 20 minutes. Eventually I cleared them all myself and put them to the side so we could talk.They brought out a small birthday slice with a candle - nice touch. It was left for over 10mins in front of my father-in-law with no cutlery. We were given no menu's to order deserts. After finally seeing they'd forgotten cutlery we asked for menus. 5 minute wait. We ordered deserts and they took a medium amount of time to arrive. My wife had to ask for water top ups three times, finally getting up and walking over to someone to get it to happen.We all commented on the way home that it had been a 'nice meal.... but what a shame about the service' etc etc. So basically it tarnished the night

On the last day of my business trip I took a stroll along Quay and discovered many local seafood restaurant with big tables, was unsure if they could accomodate a single diner so I walked on further to find a spot for me. Found a French restaurant with a terrace by the river, am very thankful to the Manager as he got me a table right at the corner by Singapore river even though I came without prior reservations. The Wine and starters recommended by the waiter was no disappointment. I greatly appreciate them for squeezing me in as I enjoyed my entire evening in a beautiful ambience with good wine, great service, savoury food and I got to catch amazing fireworks as I was there during the Lunar New Year's week
5
Our group of 18 was wandering down the river and stopped at Absinthe to see if we could eat there. They quickly accommodated our needs with a long table on the river. Despite our large group the service was great. The food was wonderful as well with a broad array of choices from lamb to seafood. Even our vegetarians were happy. The wine recommendations were reasonably priced and highly drinkable.
5
My wife and I know Singapore quite well and decided to try one of the restaurants down on the quay. We passed The Absinthe which we had read about on Trip Adviser and which had attracted quite good reviews.We decided to give it a go and I popped in to make a reservation for the following night. I speak French and the cool French guy in the smart suit took my personal details, booking details and request for a table at the waters edge but wrote nothing down. I thought perhaps just a cool professional, but had a doubt in my mind. We stopped for a drink on the way down to the restaurant the following night and I popped down to make sure that the reservation did actually exist. The cool French guy was not to be seen and a older, very friendly chap checked but there was no reservation at all, never mind a request for a table at the waters edge. We exchanged views on this. Me on lack of professionalism and the amount of competition they faced and he apologising and saying things were not at their best, but he would put it right for us if we would still come along.My wife and I discussed it and agreed we would give it a go. Big mistake. When we got there we notice no one was actually eating. The guy had made up a table by the water's edge and was trying really hard to make it up to us. We ordered a kir each, which was awful. My wife ordered a glass of white wine, which was awful. We had been waiting a long time for our food - still with no one eating, with our waiter apologising and saying it would be with us very quickly, when I popped to the toilet. On my way, the kitchen door was open and I peeked in.There was the cool French guy, but now not so cool. Yelling at the chefs who all appeared terrified. I have worked in kitchens in the past and know they can be a bit crazy sometimes, but this was a kitchen in trouble. The waiter saw my looking, smiled but said nothing. Our food arrived and guess what, yes, it was awful. Upon leaving, we spoke with the waiter who apologised, said it was a shame I saw what was going on in the kitchen. He said everything was a mess, he had spoken to the General Manager, the cool French guy, but he was not interested.What a great shame all round. A pretty rubbish experience for us, a terrible situation for the waiter and the kitchen staff and I am sure for the cool French guy and something that needs urgent attention. So, unfortunately, with so many great restaurants in Singapore, at least for the time being, until they get themselves sorted out, I would give the Absinthe a wide berth. I do hope they can get things sorted out though.Prof Lester Lloyd-Reason Cambridg

A lovely restaurant with an exceptional value lunch menu, probably the best value lunch I have had in a while!
5
An excellent way to spend a Saturday night, great French food in the open air, looking out at Singapore. Escargot were superb, Chateaubriand and Beef cheecks also very good. Very friendly service.
5
Good food, slightly pricey for a normal lunch but definitely a good value for money if you're looking for a nice place for lunch for a special date
5
We have been there with friends and family.
The French couple are really warmed, the food is great, and a good view on the river.
We will definitely be back !
3
Nothing to comment here, feel that the service is very slow, every course have to wait for 10-15 mins, give me a kind of feeling that not enough staffs working. The food also not very fantastic.
5
My wife and I had dinner at Absinthe, upstairs in the more formal dining room. Our waiter was perfection to a t - offered advice when asked, appeared at my elbow when we needed someting or wanted to order.The foie gras was sublime, the whole fish we shared (taken off the bone by the chef at our table) was beautifully cooked, and the deserts were delicious. Just like dining well in Paris, but in the middle of one of Asia's great cities. We will dine here again, if we return to Singapore
4
Depending on your mood, you could dine alfresco at the water’s edge, but we prefer the cool upstairs dining rooms with their exposed brickwork, framed pages from La Mode Illustrée, white linen and soft lighting. Formal enough to feel like a special occasion, but not at all stuffy; ask for our corner table by the window..Chef Maxim (from Le Mans, via a stint with Paul Bocuse) starts us off with a generous combination of foie gras terrine and foie gras poelé seared to a turn ($29 each); little details like onion jam spiced with French espelette chilli make it unforgettable. After a perfectly classic cognac-scented lobster bisque ($17), come Chef’s recommended specialty: whole sea bream from Brittany ($120 for two) baked in a salt crust that he ceremoniously lifts in our presence and serves in tender chunks over wilted baby spinach, tiny sautéed potatoes and sundried tomatoes, all drizzled with olive oil. If it’s your lucky night, he might bake you a golden-domed saffron soufflé (off-menu, $24 for two) like the one we ecstatically wolf down scalding-hot.If you're made of fairly stern stuff, don't leave without enjoying the absinthe ritual! Like other aniseed-based rocket fuels, this 53 percent proof Green Fairy starts off clear in the bottom of the glass, turning cloudy as iced water is dripped into it through a lump of sugar balanced on a special spoon. But if you're not, you might be advised to stick to the champagne – on the night of our visit, there’s a jolly good price of $12 for a coupe of Laurent-Perrier.

"Magnifique!" - truly a marvellous French dining experience at Absinthe, and a very remarkable evening for me. From the reservation process to the welcome at the restaurant and on to a very attentive service experience in a simply gorgeous dining room, we truly enjoyed our memorable night at @ Absinthe. The location on Boat Key is very central and easy to get to, but amongst all the "touristy" restaurants the Absinthe offers a very refined experience. A lot of love and thought has gone into the refurbishment of the historical shop house which offers an array of levels and 'quasi' private dining room atmosphere. We loved the combination of bringing out architectural highlights like the original brickwork and combining it with modern lighting fixtures, and classy dining furniture and cosy booths. Absinthe offers a great haven of comfort, style and dining pleasure amid the buzzling Boat Key destination - with great views across the Singapore river. We chose an "event menu" to celebrate a special occasion, and the "Absinthe Rouge" did not disappoint our high expectations. From great starters (Iberico ham, fresh oysters) on to a wonderful Lobster bisque and simply heavenly "foie gras" and blinis we already felt very spoiled before even touching on our main courses. The Wagyu sirloin beef was sublime - super tender and tasteful; and the roasted black cod with saffron risotto was equally scrumptious. What a delight to top off the evening with a modern take on the traditional 'tarte tatin' which we enjoyed very much, and some great coffee. All in all we felt that not only was the food very good - and very French in the best sense possible - but also we felt very well taken care of by the friendly and highly professional service staff. Absinthe is a very personal and welcoming place in our experience, but the staff also take the food and dining experience very seriously - you are given ample time to enjoy the food and drinks (excellent wines offered) with great privacy offered, and just the right balance of catering to your every need, but doing so completely unobtrusively. Needless to say we felt treated like royalty, and spoiled at the highest level in terms of the dining experience itself. Absinthe does offer high value for money, but more importantly it does offer very authentic French cuisine which is accessible and very enjoyable at the same time. We had a wonderful night at Absinthe, and would recommend this place anytime. And, oh yes: they do serve Absinthe, of course

It has been awhile since I last visited Absinthe despite the fact that my offices, at UOB Plaza, is a stone throw’s away. On my last visit neither the food nor the service provided any real reason to return. But a friend had invited me, and thus I walked there gamely. Boat Quay is not my favorite place to hang out with its overpriced food outlets serving sub-par food to hapless tourists, whose frequent and sudden stops, make for footpath hazards. In contrast, Absinthe’s simple country inspired décor was charming when I first went and charmed again on this trip.The menu is not extensive and this, to my mind, this is a good thing. I had the duck rillettes, beef ribeye and the tarte tartin, not very adventuresome but a safe response to my previous experience. Rillette is a method of converting tough but sweet meat spread that should kiss a baguette and should dress the tongue with velvet (as opposed to silk). Specifically the duck rillette should be dry-brined, braised in stock, shredded and mixed with armagnac and spices and sealed in duck fat. Dangers are too much salt in the brining, over enthusiastic alcohol and over shredding resulting in ‘oat porridge’ or rough baby food. Absinthe’s rillettes were good. It was flavorsome, not overly salted, velvety though I could not taste the armagnac. But this may have been because the rillettes were paired with frisee salad with walnut dressing. I think the idea was that the bitterness of the frisee would act as a counterpoint to the sweetness of the duck. To my mind the greater bitterness of the frisee made the duck less sweet. I thus ate the duck first, then the salad. On the other hand I loved the parmesan crisp. But then I adore parmesan. The ribeye was Australian and surprising well hung. I ordered medium raw and got medium rare. All good. The big disappointment was dessert. I had first asked for the Absinthe ice cream but there were none left. I settled for the tarte tartin (an ingredient simple dish that is severely underrated) and wished I had not squandered my calories so. The positive was that the pastry was thin, crunchy and not at all soggy. Unfortunately that was it. There were no soft and resilient apple, there was no tartness to counter the sweetness but, crime of all, the caramel, the soul of a tarte tartin, was burnt in some places and watery in others. The wine, on the other hand, was good despite its affordability. My friend asked me to choose and after a short discussion with the sommelier settled on a recommendation that was not on the menu. I thought I had heard Chateau Fage from the Graves de Vayres (which I had previously enjoyed) but it was only when I was leaving that I looked at the label and saw ‘La Fage’. But with an impatient taxi driver waiting, I was not able to read the label. Nevertheless was grateful for a good sommelier as I loved the idea of a new discovery
4
A lovely setting by the river and a great looking menu. The oysters were great to start but the prawn and chorizo was missing the final finesse to make it outstanding. Same with the mains, the beef cheeks were nice but not great. Dessert was a disappointment. The tarte Tatum was actually mushed apple on a solid pastry with a bitter caramel poured over. On a plus point the house red Pinot at 55$ was a bargain. Price for 2 was 200sgd for 4 glasses of wine, starters, mains and a shared dessert. Will I be back? Probably. The position by the river is great but the dishes need something else to be really classed as great.
3
Average food- gone down in quality. Lamb was overcooked, service was questionable, nothing special and will not be going here again.
5
Absinthe is better than it has ever been
The service is flawless, the food fantastic
I think it has the best value for money of any French restaurant in Singapore and I have tried a lot of them!
4
Nice French food and attractive wine selection. Friendly restaurant Manager. Efficient service. Slightly expensive
5
I went to Absinthe, after a few years... and I was surprised by the improvements done to the menu and especially the service.Really appreciated the quality of service provided and we had a very good taste of French cuisine for an affordable price.The manager seemed to be everywhere making sure everything goes smoothly which is quite appreciated in a city where service sometimes tend to be a bit superficial.Will come back for sure
4
This was a very good experience.The set dinner menu was recommended and it didn't disappoint in quality.The food was well cooked and tasty. Some of it could have been a little warmer and the aircon didn't help.The waiter was very helpful and also acted as sommelierHis recommendation for a white burgundy was very good and matched well with the menu.Not cheap but you get what you pay fo
5
Excellent fois gras, delicious marinated pork, nice vegetarian dishes! Very good and simple French food.Good choice of wine at descent price which is rare in Singapore. And the best of all: we had an excellent Swiss sparkling wine which is far better than over rated champagne! Last but not least, we had no issues in ordering ice water for free which is a must for us in order to be returning customers.Great location beside the river!We will come back, thank

It was a lovely evening. The air was breezy so we sat outside next to the river. Across was the old parliament skyline as well as the view of the business district. There were boats long the Singapore River. This was just am amazing atmosphere. This restaurant serves decent French food. I ordered the foie gras which was competently done with nice big slices. The lobster bisque was also good. For the main course, we both ordered the black cod with risotto on the side. The cod was fatty - paired with artichoke. Again it was a good rendition but will probably forget about it in a few days. All in all the food was good effort but not out of the world fantastic. Would recommend this as a good place to eat along boat quay
5
Absinthe are located in the middle of Boat Quay where you will be welcomed by many Indian and Chiese restaurant before you reach here. They have both open space on the ground floor as well as the second and third floor with private room. The lunch set is very good value and the portion they serve as well as the quality of food is wonderful. I like their steak which is one of their main offering. Unlike the regular French, you will not be thinking about the heavy sauce which comes with the food. A little bit difficult to find, however, you should try this cosy French alongside the Boat Quay
4
Modern French influenced menu. Visited here three times now. No complaints on food quality and presentation. Wine list is not extensive but more exclusive. Prices are up but so is the quality of service and fare. Dine inside or outside by the river and watch the electric boats go by. This is a nice upmarket casual restaurant
4
We sat upstairs inside in a booth which was lovely. There are many options of where to sit including tables literally next to the river.Service was efficient and friendly without being intrusive and the Sommelier was very helpful and knowledgable.The four of us all had various meals which gave a good indication of the food quality. We started with Irish oysters ... I was dubious as obviously we were a long way from Ireland but was pleasantly surprised at the fresh tasting standard of them - delicious!My main of lamb racks were sensational big fat juicy lamb chops , again always nervous when ordering at fine dining establishments that I will get a tea spoon sized serving - not here !My dining companions had the pork which was fabulous the duck and the cod.A very enjoyable filling delicious meal. Would go again for a special occasio
3
The burgers, which I did not get looked great. The steak tartare was mediocre at best. Booze selection was not bad. Would not return likely, but would say that the burger would be the only reason that would drag me back there.
4
The set lunches here are decent value at $38++ for 3 courses. Service was efficient, but didn't seem that friendly. I had the duck confit for main course which I thought was excellent. Starter and dessert were good but not exceptional. We came as a group of 5 and shared a bottle of wine with the total bill coming to $315. I've been here a few times for lunch and would certainly come back
5
One could not ask for more from a restaurant in terms of preparation, service, and dining experience.From the initial inquiry through to the end of service, everything was handled impeccably by the team. Reservations and Events Manager Jeanine could not have been more prompt or helpful and arranging the event including making special provisions to seat us separately from the main dining area for privacy despite the private rooms being booked on the night.Chef Nicolas did an outstanding job in the kitchen with his brigade with perfectly timed service for our delicious and beautifully plated 6 courses. Ken and YL ensured that every diner was well looked after during the course of the meal with fresh glasses and frequent but well judged top ups of our wine selection.Vincent should be, and no doubt is, extremely proud to have brought a European level of service and professionalism to our local dining scene.Many thanks and rest assured we will be back again soo

I think whether you declare this as great or average depends on your perspective and experience. I have eaten a lot of French food, and the food at Absinthe was, honestly, just average or, really, below average. The bread was very good, the lobster bisque was tasty, but the fois gras terrine was so-so. The duck leg confit had tasty, crispy skin but very dried-out meat and was accompanied by what were supposed to be sarladaise potatoes (fried in duck fat) but they had absolutely no flavor, no crispy edges, no seasoning, nothing to make me want more. The grilled Iberico pork was dry and overwhelmed by mustard. Our meal would have been acceptable at half the price, but for 150 SGD, we felt unsatisfied. We sat riverside, which was very pleasant; with fans overhead, it was cool enough, and watching the goings-on up and down the river was fun. Service was fine, if at times a little slow. But keep your expectations for the food low if you dine here. With so many options in Singapore, I would not make this a destination
5
I have dined at this restaurant twice in the last 6 months, this is obviously an indication that the first time was enjoyable. The 2nd time was just as good by the way…..The service is very good, both visits we had a Frenchman as our waiter and he was very informative and helpful with the menu and in particular wine selection. The food was out of this world and I can’t wait to go back.The restaurant itself is in a very good location without door seating available, I prefer inside which is also very nice. If you are after fine French food in Singapore then you can’t go past this place
4
Had a really good dining experience here. The waiter was attentive and knowledgable. My friend had food preferences and the chef came out to discuss and customize a dish for her. I had the filet which was amazing. If you don't mind the heat, then get a table outdoors by the river

I went on a date here and ordered the oysters, Manga Avocado Tartare and a cheeseburger. All were delicious. Decent wine and liquor selection as well. For both my date and I the appetizer, dinner, and drinks came out to about 120 SGD. The view outside of the river and Marina Bay Sands light show was fantastic during dinner

I went there for lunch today and the waiter spilled some mineral water on my pants while filling up my cup. He saw it and pretended nothing happened, only mumbled a soft sorry when I said "excuse me". After that, he just walked away and left me with a wet pant. I called him back and told him to get me some tissue and he could not just walk away like that without. He just came back with some tissue and quickly walked away, pretending nothing happened and never apologize. Horrible service... This is a French restaurant but crappy service... Avoid this stupid restaurant…

This is a restaurant with delicious French cuisine but the service can be a little slow. The set lunches are great value and provide plenty of choice. Nicely decorated with a good vibe but they do need to improve on their service.The Restaurant is located on the waterside in Boat Quay. Main restaurant is located upstairs which is accessed by some steep stairs and could be challenging for anyone with mobility constraints

Absinthe is a small French restaurant beside the Singapore River. Very nice location. Make sure you have an outside table. Absinthe is clearly a slightly classier restaurant than the many others in the same riverside quay. We had the four course set menu with a choice of main course. There is also the option of a cheese board. The food was fantastic and the service very good. The pace is a bit slow (French style) which we really liked. As usual in Singapore, the wine list was fairly pricey, but overall the cost was reasonable considering the quality of the food. I would strongly recommend Absinthe to any visitors to Singapore.

Have followed the restaurant since it was at bukit pasoh! Great foodnd service.
Will be back for more. Highly recommend.

No rushing you out the door in this lovely little gem on Boat Quay. We lingered a few hours, moving from a delicious (very rich) French lunch (confit duck is divine) to a bottle of Pinot outside, which we enjoyed while watching a tropical rainstorm. The service here is very good, quick and unobtrusive. No sense that they want to get you in and out and clear the table for the next person. This was my second business lunch here and I will bring clients here again in future.

We have been to Absinthe a few times over the last 3 years.There is a new chef and I like it. The restaurant used to be focussing on "fine dining" style french food. It was doing quite well but not great. It is indeed very challenging to consistently deliver great french fine dining on a large restaurant - Absynthe has some very large loverly rooms inside - while keeping a reasonable price. Now there is a new chief and they are focussing on a more "bistrot" style french food. I think personnaly this a very good choice. What we tried - the two tartares as well as a couple of other dishes - were very well prepared, tasty and nice.Wine was really good and quite reasonable.The outside sitting is definitely nice as you have a river view - good to try for the first time there - but the indoor room at the first floor has a very nice decoration. This is where we were and the atmosphere is really nice.Overall, a very good experience. Definitely recommend it and like the change of direction

Reason for my two stars only cos I am so disappointed in the service. We sat down and waited for the waitress to take our order after 20mins and she was taking another couples order who arrived 10mins after us. I think the waitress completely forgotten our existence so we called for another waiter to take our order. Food came out to our table very slow and it was warm when we start eating it. I asked for the bill and had to ask again twice cos I think we were again forgotten. Never coming back again
5
My husband and I chose to dine at Absinthe last week, and we were delighted. The restaurant definitely lives up to its great reputation. The service was perfect, the food was excellent, and the wine list is exceptional: I never thought I could find such a wide selection of french wine in Singapore. I will definitely come back
2
The "decoration" is really really ugly. The space layout on the river is weird. Service is, even for a "French" restaurant, really really poor. Had to ask 3 times for the bill. Slow service as well. Located between two asian sea-food restaurants, why would you try to set-up a "fancy" look...? Nothing special here, plenty of other French stalls better to go to
5
Visited Absinthe last night and was a great experience. View of the quay alone made it worth the seat but also very reasonably priced for Singapore. The menu was authentic French fare. Had oysters ($9) followed by the Joue de Boeuf (shin of beef, $28) and several glasses of delicious Cahors ($12 each). The service was prompt, the free pain authentic. Most of all though the beef, served with accompanying mash and green beans, was succulent, rich and generous. Can't think of a relatively simple dish that I've enjoyed quite so much. Just stunning. Will definitely be returning

Found this restaurant through Tripadvisor and tried it prior to our week long cruise. We loved it that much we revisited for lunch on our return from sailing.I could go on and on about the amazing food but for visitors to Singapore this offers incredible value in the, reputedly, sixth most expensive city in the world. As you approach this restaurant on Boat Quay there are no exterior signs advertising the fixed price lunch and dinner menus which suited my wife and I as it was already difficult enough finding space at this very popular riverside restaurant. At night the ambience is terrific with river boats cruising by and the laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel adding to the general buzz of tourists on the walkways.We were greeted by the owners who made us feel so welcome and the service overall was very efficient. Thank you for helping make our visit to Singapore so enjoyable

When we last visited Absinthe in 2012, we fell in love with the mushroom soup, and we wished we had a more private table because we were seated next to a birthday party. We returned for the Valentine set dinner at Absinthe, and we found that the menu consisted of their most popular dishes from the a la carte menu, which suited us fine because now we want to go back to try some of those dishes again. We were delighted to have to mushroom soup again and to refresh our memory of the umami/truffle taste. The seared prawns and chorizo, pan fried foie gras with fig and artichoke, and roasted Australian rack of lamb were superb. We were assigned to a large booth on the second floor that added privacy and romance under the orange-glowing filaments of large light bulbs and a candle on the table. Our only complaint was a 30-minute wait between two of the courses, but they were worth waiting for. They even had a semillon sweet wine by the glass that was just perfect for us. When we left, my wife was given a goodie bag with cosmetics. The serving staff were helpful and polite. We feel Absinthe provides one of the finest dining experiences in Singapore. Absinthe made our Valentine dinner a romantic and memorable one. And when we left the restaurant clutching the goodie bag and feeling sated and content, we were in the lovely evening environs of Boat Quay

I made a reservation via the Chope app for my dad's birthday and our family of 4 were looking forward to finally trying out French cuisine again, since we don't eat fois gras, enjoy fancy cheeses or delight in paying way too much for food that we ordinary people can't appreciate (as opposed to food connoisiours). And I have to say, Absinthe did not disappoint on almost all of the dishes we order. I personally didn't enjoy the duck confit as much, but their signature australian tenderloin and rack of lamb were fantastic. The starters of the lobster salad, sauteed prawns with chorizo and lobster bisque were so delicious! My mom also ordered their creme brulee (not my type of dessert) but you have to taste their apple tart which is freshly baked upon order. Coffee was great as well, not too bitter and watery. I noticed cigars there so for the afficianados, there's your chance. The wine recommended by their staff was light and fruity and easy on the wallet too. All in, an extremely enjoyable dinner and we will be back for more. Spent $420 in total (4 adults). Only minor thing that bothered me was the Chope app said there was a DBS discount of 15% for lunch and dinner (except for v'day set/promotional menu) and the waiter said it didn't apply to us even though we paid by DBS and ordered from the ala carte menu.
5
The staff were very friendly and service was great. We had the prawns for starters and the duck confit for main course and the madeleines for dessert. All the food tasted amazing and the portions were well sized. Would definitely recommend this place.

Excellent food...
Very thorough wine list with very reasonable prices..
Great service..
I would definitely like to go back there!

If you enjoy French cuisine, this is the place to go in Singapore. Located in Boat Quay, Singapore. Our hosts for lunch were French ex-pats in Singapore, thus are "authorities" on French cuisine. I started with seared foie gras. My main course was braised beef cheeks in a wine sauce with crushed (not mashed) potatoes. Dessert was fresh fruit with a home-made sorbet. Food was great. Service was god
2
Very nice setting by the water, pretty good food but given it's billing as one of the best French restaurants in Singapore it didn't live up to expectations. The service was terrible. After sitting down, took half an hour to order drinks, then the wine took another 15 minutes to arrive. In the two and a half hours we were there not once did a waiter come over to the table to see if we wanted anything or how the meal was. Unless the service improved I wouldn't go back. Bras gavroche better on all fronts...
4
The service was impeccable and food top-notch.We went for the S$38++ set lunch and our favourites among the dishes we had were the grilled prawns with avocados and crème fraiche (starter) and braised Kurobuta pork belly (main). We also had the Niçoise salad with seared tuna (starter), seared seabass filet (main), and crêpe suzette and chocolate pot de crème for dessert - all of which were delightful.Furthermore, we received a delicious complimentary dessert platter (sticky toffee pudding) because it was my dining partner's birthday. I am truly grateful to the staff for taking note of this and arranging this surprise even though I hadn't requested for it when I made the reservation.I'd certainly like to come back for more quality food at reasonable prices (considering the amount of satisfaction we derived from the meal!), in a lovely environment that was classy without being stuffy.Thanks Absinthe
5
This is the place I frequent every so often for some evening wines and light quality meals. If you are dining solo, sit at the bar counter where you get to watch oysters being chucked and chat with Francois the funny French chef. A definite keeper because I know I won't be disappointed
3
went there for lunch at 38 sgd per head, service was a bit slow and the choice of food pretty low.we were very desapointed by the meal, as not really tasty and original. Please avoid the french burger with frozen french fries, and aslo the foie gras as the size was almost ridiculous. the seabass was so so alsoThe restaurant is well positionned and nicely handled, with nice music.I would recommend fleur de sel for the same price for lunch.even the wine considered from Languedoc was not terrific for one glassThe chamapagne is a good value for money...should try (grand cru at 14 dollars)desert was not terrific too: sabayon and crepes were average
4
I had been drawn to Absinthe prior to my arrival in Singapore by some airplane advertising, but a long delay acumulated elsewhere made my friend and I arrive really late that night. The waiters were tidying up the tables ready to close. There were no customers left. We hesitated and considered going to a seafood restaurant just meters away. Then, a maitre discovered us and offered to set a table outside. The view of the Singapore commercial district is superb at night, with all the colourful lights mirrored by the river. We were seated right on the waterfront and shared a mixed platter of French deli (no chef left at 11 PM). The food was tasty and the beer cold. We paid cash, got no receipt and tipped the waiter who had to wait politely for us to finish our meal just after midnight. Four stars for a bit of understandable superficiality. I shall visit again (but earlier in the evening) to produce the fifth star
4
I ate here at a corporate function upstairs, the starter was the sharing platter of pate and cheeses which were very tasty and authentic. A sea bass main was extremely enjoyable and well cooked with complimenting vegetables. A very nice meal on the waterfront with a small outside balcony for viewing of the Singapore skyline at night
4
We visited Absinthe on a Saturday evening and after a shaky start with 3 waiters unable to show us to a table, the chef came out, apologised profusely & ushered us to a lovely table by the river with a wonderful view of Marina Bay.Our waiter was very attentive, food delicious and the wine my other half chose was superb, if rather expensive.Once we finished dinner, we chatted with a very knowledgable member of staff about their different Absinthes and obviously had to try one.All in all, we had a wonderful evening, it is not cheap, but the food was lovely, quite rich, but expertly executed, the wine list was extensive and the service was good.After saving up, we would definitely go back!!!!
4
I went with some friends and with no reservation. I was offered a table near the water , the dinner waswas good. The cod was very well made. The wine had to be more cold, the petit chablis was good but not fresh enough.
4
Business dinner with overseas clients. Perfect setting, excellent service and impeccable food. Tasty, elegant, refined. French culinary art in Singapore... At a high price, but definitely worth it!
5
Piece of France on the Singapore River. Enjoyable visit. And they even had my favorite eau de vie. When walking on the Boat Quai you have all the choises of different cuisines, you wonder what you really want to eat. So what do Europians do they choose French, and this time it was a fantastic choise. I had a canard confit and a tarte of the day and all was good. A bit prizy, but who cares. On a holiday
3
Made a lunch reservation as it was Restaurant Week and have heard great reviews about Absinthe. There were two entrees.... chartuterie (abit too porky smell for me) and king prawn (not fresh). I chose the halibut as the main course while my friend chose the pork belly. The pork belly was good, however, the halibut was quite tasteless. Dessert was a trilogy of valrhona chocolate.... I found it good but my friend was very disappointed. In term of service, the staff were good! The stars are for the service.

Going for lunch or dinner at Absinth is always a treat. This restaurant has consistently, or at least for the last 8 years since I have lived in Singapore, met and exceeded my expectations.I have dined at many restaurants worldwide, from 3 star establishments down to some very good hawkers here in Singapore. Absinth positions itself right in that sweet spot where you are looking for a nice establishment for a night out (maybe to treat the in-laws, have a romantic dinner with you partner or a good business dinner) without having to bring 5 credit cards to pay at the end or to only be disappointed by mediocre food that you could probably have prepared better yourself.The restaurant itself is very nicely located along the Singapore River on Boat Quay and offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Personally I always prefer indoor in Singapore, but that’s just me. The décor is elegant and the various rooms inside the old shop house building also allow for private events.The food itself is perfect, the main reason for my many return visits. They consistently source high quality produce to prepare their frequently changing French inspired menu. Oysters are some of the best in town and so is their prime rib on the bone! I always like to end any meal with a good quality cheese board and Absinth’s selection certainly won’t fail to impress.Very professional and friendly staff, which are able to explain anything about the menu, adds to the overall dining experience. The wine recommendations from their elaborate wine list always hit the mark. All in all this is one of those locations that consistently deliver high quality food, terrific service in a great setting at, for Singapore standards, affordable prices
5
By far the best French resto you will find in Singapore! Perfect date night place that serves delicious French food and great wines. After I tried it the first time, I've always gone back for more! They serve the best Foie Gras. Kudos to Chef Francois
4
located in the lively Boat Quay district, Absinthe is a very nice french restaurant with a lovely atmosphere. You choose to dine inside in a very chic dinning room or outsideby the river.The staff is very nice. We had the tasting menu and it was really really good except for the pork which was dry and disapointing compare to the rest of the food. Wines are good and prices are expensive but decent for Singapore and for a french restaurant ! We probably return to taste more as the A la carte dishes were very tempting as wel
5
I had dinner with my boss a few months back and was wowed by the black cod ... so much so that I decided to hold my mother in law's 70th birthday party at Absinthe. an excellent decision. the staff were helpful, accommodating and generally fantastic. Last minute additions meant the table layout no loner suited - they called me, proposed an alternative and got on with it - no fuss. Also accommodated a menu change. beautiful restaurant + incredible food + fantastic staff = a night to remember.thank you Absinthe
3
I have been a few times at Absinthe as one of my friend was chef there.You can have a very good value for money like you could end up with your stomach as empty as your wallet.To avoid misunderstanding, I think the menu is quite unbalanced as some of their dishes are really generously served, and therefore match the high price of the food there, but some could really disappoint you like their ravioli soup priced at a premium without adding to the food experience.On the overall, most of the food is really good and you chose to go there when you know what you want to get!Nice venu
4
Stopped here for lunch after several hours in the Asian Civilisation Museum. They offer fixed menu for $28. Duck terrine with pistachios was delicious. Oven fried french chicken was ok but for my taste slightly undercooked and over salted. The dessert was average. The service and the ambiance were great. They also have decaf coffee which was a pleasant surprise. Recommended for a nice lunch along the river.
5
Definitely one of the best French restaurants in Singapore. The setting is excellent and the food wonderful. It's maybe a little expensive for tourists but the experience is worth of the price.

Got to get one's viewing priorities right! Ie, the lady gets the view!... Of the city.Food was good; very good steak. Pricey yes, but not stupidly so for a good restaurant. Wine list is ok but not great. Good enough unless your taste is fairly international, in which case you will be disappointed. BUT, since the best wines come from Australia anyway, you have nothing to worry about.Service was very good, but not hovering. Ie, I had to wave to the waiter for attention, but he/they came right away.All up meal for 2 of red snapper (s$42) and Tenderloin (s$48) came to s$165 including 2 glasses of wine at $12 each, water at 6. The tart was good too. Apple and ice cream.Note: on top of the prices above, they add 7% GST and 10% service charge.I really hate that sort of deceptive stuff, and it spoiled it for me, right at the end
5
This restaurant has really got something, the wow factor is almost tangible. With views over the waterfront what is there not to like? Answer not much! There is an extensive menu to choose from which has got something for everyone. It can get very busy but we asked them to prepare us a nice table for an hour ahead whilst we went elsewhere and they duly obliged. Nice place
5
Absinthe is probably one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I absolutely enjoy coming here.I've been patronising Absinthe since it first opened its doors at Bukit Pasoh Rd. The outlet, now in Boat Quay, has the most quaint setting and lovely food. I love the lighting and the exposed brick walls of the indoor dining, and the alfresco terrace that allows you to dine by the water.Chef Francois' style is classical French. That means no crazy inventive items on the menu, but his food is executed perfectly. That, I believe, is the main draw of this place. And the cheese! I was introduced to eppoisses here, and that has now become my favourite cheese. If you're looking for a romantic night out with your spouse, or a place to impress for business lunch, this is the place to be. Vincent and team will make you feel right at ease, almost like you're visiting the home of a friend. You won't be disappointed
5
Beautiful scallops, cod fish, tender beef shoulder and ooohh we loved the soup! (Traditional lobster bisque) The service was faultless. The wait staff were also friendly and attentive and would refill our bread promptly without any askingalso dessert was a winner! The white chocolate mousse was not overwhelmingly sweet (like white chocolate usually is). Likely to pop by this restaurant again because of the lovely food and service :
5
What a difference to the hustle and bustle along Boat Quai. Once you are upstairs in the Absinthe you immerse into a little French cultured restaurant. Nice atmosphere, helpful and friendly service personnel, good selection of quality menus and drinks including entrées and desserts. The three different meats we ordered were just done the way we requested. Served nicely arranged in our plates and well-seasoned. Towards the end of our three hour relaxing and enjoyable evening the lady explained very knowledgeable what an absinthe is and with her explanations we were able to watch her dignified process of preparing and serving us an absinthe as a final drink. Great service, relaxing atmosphere, most delicious meals. Nice seating for couples and small groups
5
My wife, daughter, and I ate there last weekend. We had reservations and got a great seat outside next to the water. Our only complaint of the night is that it took quite a while for anyone to notice we were there. Finally, when the manager noticed he ran to our table and took care of us. From there on everything was first class.The wine list was not huge but had a great selection and the prices were good. The food starting from the entree all the way through desert was fantastic. Sitting outside watching the crazy world go by at the Boat Quay was an experience everyone needs in Singapore. At the end the chef came out and was seriously interested in our opinion, which we gave him. We told him what I am writing here. The meal was perfect and we had a perfect evening. We will be back. Thank you all very much

My partner and I tried this restaurant on the recommendation by reviews from Tripadvisor. I have to agree with the reviews and would recommend this to anyone who is after fine French food and awesome service. My meal was fantastic although my partners was a little chewy but all in all the food was well worth it. When they were aware of the slight issue with one meal they could not be more helpful or sorry for the issue. That alone over shone the food issue and both of us left the restaurant very happy and would recommend anyone to partake of the meals at this establishment. It does live up to all the very good reviews it receives
5
My wife and I have dined on three occasions now at Absinthe when in Singapore and we thoroughly recommend it to travellers and locals alike. The style is French and yet unpretentious and we've been made to feel welcome each time by well-presented and efficient wait staff. Walking along Boat Quay can be a little intimidating with vendors vying for your custom. Fortunately we always pre-book at Absinthe and once inside and seated you feel like you are in a high-end oasis away from the otherwise bustling Boat Quay. The food, under the supreme guidance of Chef/Owner Francois Mermilliod is exceptional as is the wine list. Whilst the restaurant seats many it is possible to be slightly hidden away for a romantic dinner and is equally comfortable for a business group at lunch. We'll be back when next in Singapore on business or holiday
5
I had lunch with my wife at Absinthe in Boat Quay a few days ago. Service is impeccable, the environment elegant and stylish, staff knowledgeable. Their set lunch selection is among the best is Singapore, with 5-6 choices for Entrees, Mains and Desserts. And as it should be in a French (or Italian ) restaurant, bread is served with the meals.Prices for this kind of food and service and environment are reasonable. My strongest recommendations for Absinthe. I have been there maybe 10 times for lunch and 3 for dinner and it never fails to amaze me. I left the restaurant with a smile of satisfaction of my fac
1
Food was served when we already run out of topic to discuss. And i guess the crews arent well trained too. The one who served kept saying "i will check" everytime we have questions. do I need to say more?
5
Simply the best restaurant for people, value and good quality in singapore. Wine is also very good I deed and fairly priced. Absinthe is always at the top of my list
5
Chef Francois is rather accommodating. I have arranged wine dinners there time and again and Absinthe always surpass our expectations. With sommelier Vincent at the helm, the service is second to none.
5
Fantastic restaurant and staff. Great for business lunches and after work dinners or something special.
5
We've known and loved dining at this restaurant since it was in Bukit Pasoh, and with Chef Francois still making French magic in the kitchen, this is definitely a not-to-miss! Not only is the setting of Absinthe great, think sophisticated and stylish, but the food is fit for a king. I’ve gone for the set menu a couple of times, which is great if you’ve got time to spare and want to treat yourself; the Carré d’Agneau is delicious, as is the Boeuf Wagyu
5
Had our wedding anniversary dinner here on a good friends recommendation, and we are very glad for it! Great restaurant with a great view in Singapore a very nice combination. The service was excellent, the staff very helpful and attentive, the atmosphere in the restaurant was nice and very intimate. The food was great, I had a whole fish and it was skillfully prepared and good to the last bite. The wine selection and help from their team was great and was priced better than most places in Singapore. Every item we ordered was to our satisfaction a truly memorable anniversary dinner. We will definitely be back. If dining indoors definitely ask for one of the tables by the windows a great view of the waterfront and the skylin

I and my friends recently visited Absinthe ! We truly indulged in exclusive 5-Course Degustation by Executive Chef Francois. The flavors rich and intense, the presentation exquisite and contemporary! Besides, the reasonably priced wines and champagne perfect for us stretching out an indelible evening. If you're looking for sweeping, serious grandeur, then hasten to Absinthe
5
Have been visiting Absinthe foe a while now and is one of if not my favourite restaurant in Singapore. To have such a great combination of amazing food and great service with experience is hard to top. Well worth the visit if you have the opportunity you won't regret it
5
Restaurants with a great view are seldom great food experiences, but Absinthe bucks the trend here! Out of all French restaurants in Singapore, it is simply my favourite for being constantly at the top end of flavours. I always order fish there( as I find fish dishes more difficult to execute than meat ones) and I hv never been disappointed. The cod is slightly undercooked to perfection and pairing it with saffron and chorizo risotto turned out to be both bold and exquisite! The ravioles are also very refined (for what could be a-too-simple-to-feature-on-the-menu dish) and the carabineros are out of this world. Absinthe is not a cheap place to go to but I would rather eat less outside and more often there than miss out on this excellent restaurant. Don't think twice, go
5
I had heard about this restaurant from friends and finally decided to try. I am a self confessed greenie and make it a point to ask the chef's about where they get their seafood and if it was sustainable. My experience in Singapore has been sad a surprising number of chef's do not really understand the concept of sustainability in seafood or they just "lie" and say "yes". In talking to chef Francois it quickly became obvious that he was very aware of his products and went to considerable expense to buy quality sustainable product and could explain the source of each one of them.The food was simply outstanding, especially the Lamb and the Chilean seabass. This is one of the finer French restaurants in Singapore in all regards
5
Absinthe is my all time favorite restaurant in Singapore. Absolutely delicious food and excellent service. A must try if you want an excellent lunch or dinner!
5
Being on holidays in Singapore we didn't expect to experience the best French cuisine we ever had. On the recommendation of a friend who is living in Singapore we decided to try Absinthe on the last day of our holidays as we were overdosed on Asian cuisine.The restaurant overlooks the Singapore river and the view is just magnificent. Deco of the restaurant was very chic and I particularly love the long glowing filament bulbs over hanging each table.We ordered the degustation menu which was very reasonably priced for 6 courses. The highlights were :Foie Gras- The Mrs absolutely adored the Foie Gras. It was cooked to perfection. I have had heaps of Foie Gras before and I must say Absinthe has the best I ever had. Foie Gras can be over cooked easily but the chef got it spot on.We also had scallops carpaccio. The saltiness of the scallops blended perfectly with the lemon dressing.Roasted Rack of Lamb - Perfectly cooked and juicy. Loved the Thyme infused sauce and the goat cheese added a nice flavor to the overall dish.Towards the end of the meal, the chef, Francois visited us as he was doing his rounds with all the patrons. I find that this a very nice touch that the chef is interested in interacting with the customers and checking on them. Overall Absinthe has been the gem of all the restaurants we tried in Singapore. We would definitely go back again when we are back
5
I have to give this a 5 because we keep going back, again and again, year after year -- an indication of how much we enjoy Absinthe! The atmosphere is elegant but relaxed. The view is lovely and the tables spacious enough that we don't feel cramped while we dine. The food is consistently excellent. I always plan to order ala carte but most often get caught by the set menu which offers such a great selection of treats. I cannot possible recommend a special dish as we have enjoyed everything dish we've had. Always on our list of recommended restaurants for local and visiting friends

It is a pleasure to dine at Absinthe as always; where the beautiful restaurant interior, warm service and kitchen team and of course, the food, completes the dining experience. Absinthe has recently changed their seasonal menu to the Summer menu and I had their Grilled Baby Octopus Salad with Avocado and Balsamic Dressing, Grilled King Prawn and Angel Hair Pasta in Ume Shoyu dressing, Halibut Filet with Organic Spelt and Olive Tapenade and ended with the Valrhona Manjari Chocolate Mousse with Summer Berries. I also had some small bites of their homemade Charcuterie courtesy of the Chef.The Charcuterie consisted of the country style Pork Pâté, Duck and Pistachio Terrine and Duck Rillette on Toast. The tangy cornichons complement the well seasoned Charcuterie and the Rillette on Toast was my favorite. The Grilled Baby Octopus Salad was dressed perfectly, with just the right amount of dressing on the salad and the hot grilled octopus were seasoned just right. Complimentary from the Chef, the Grilled Australian King Prawn with a savory miso tomato crumble and Angel Hair Pasta tossed in Ume Shoyu dressing left a deep impression! The pasta was refreshing and the plating of the dish with the micro-herbs is simple but beautiful.I love fish but find it hard to sear it perfectly so I am of course, pleased with the crusty Halibut fillet served on a bed of creamy spelt with finely sliced zucchini and cherry tomatoes. The olive tapenade on top the fish was a nice addition with a touch of citrus oil that enhanced the flavor of the fish. Ending the meal with coffee and sinful Valrhona chocolate mousse with summer berries (and extra raspberry sorbet) leaves one satisfied and full. Mr. Allen, the service staff assisting me today also provided excellent information on the menu and it is enjoyable speaking with him throughout the meal. Will definitely return

Had a corporate luncheon at Absinthe, and had the pleasure of enjoying the delicious food. Many thumbs up to the chef! Service was good, although the appetiser and main took quite long to prepare, which left our guests waiting rather long. But the good food and lovely dining area quite compensated for that.Special mention to the King Prawn with Angel Hair Spaghetti that left our organiser craving more! The wagyu beef cheek, grilled snapper, and chocolate mousse with summer berries were really good too
5
I dined at Absinthe this week with a friend. The manager was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable of the food and great wine that was served.The food was spot on from the white asparagus with parma ham to the veal and the amazing cheese platter.Service was top class and the decor of the restaurant was very stylish ... a surprise to see this top quality restaurant in Boat Quay.Very highly recommended. Can not wait to return
5
Absinthe is one of my favourite restaurant in Singapore. It is situated beside Singapore river so you can have a pleasant walk before or after the dinner along the river. The ambience of the restaurant is cosy, comfortable and is ideal for couples or with friends. The menu is not long but comprehensive: it includes oyster, seafood, foie gras, poultry, beef etc. It is a French restaurant helm by a French chef but still embodies a Japanese and Asian touch in the cooking. It is cleverly executed and will pamper you with a refreshing and satisfying meal without feeling it being too "heavy" for the stomach. The '5 courses menu Absinthe' is a great value menu compared to other restaurants in Singapore that charges double the price by simply spraying some foam or putting an edible flower on it. To have a meal that is cooked from the heart in a pleasant and classy environment with warm service, just go to Absinthe

We had a corporate dinner event at Absinthe on 9 July and it was such a memorable experience for us as the host and our guests too. Every dishes from the soup - Lobster bisque, bread, entree - seared hokkaido scallops, mains - beef cheeks and black cod and the dessert Valrhona Choc Tart was superb! Bravo to Chef Francois!Friendly service crew and nice cosy ambience contributed to the success of the event!Will certainly patronage Absinthe again

Tucked away amidst the hustle and bustle of Boat Quay, the restaurant transports you into a cosy setting once you step foot into its charming premises. Get a seat by the window for views of the Singapore river and skyline.Quintessentially French, the degustation and ala carte menu boasts classic dishes like Foie Gras, Duck Leg Confit and Cote de Boeuf, but what is interesting is how owner Chef Francois Mermilliod pairs local flavours to give a special twist to some of the dishes.For example, the appetizer of Seared Hokkaido Scallops comes with Braised Daikon – not a typical ingredient found in French dining, but regardless, one that lifts the scallop dish which is also aromatically perfumed with a Lemon Thyme Emulsion.Definitely a great way to savour the medley of dishes would be to try the affordable degustation menu. Starting off with a refreshing appetizer of Hamachi (Yellow tail) Carpaccio with Aquitine Caviar, you are next presented with an amazing intensely flavoured Lobster Bisque, which preps you up for the final starter, which is a decadent Foie Gras, the richness of which is perfectly cut and balanced by the tart Morello Cherries reduction that accompanies it.For the mains, there is a choice between Braised Wagyu Beef Cheeks or the Cabillaud – a Roasted Black Cod dish that sits atop a delightfully-light Prawn Risotto, served with Kaffir Lime Leaf Emulsion. This is one of the recommended dishes and it’s easy to see why. Desserts, too, get the fusion twist with the introduction of a Jasmine Crème Brulee, perfectly paired with a refreshing Yuzu Sherbet – the exotic Jasmine essence is infused with just the right deft touch into the crème brulee. Of course, the classic Chocolate Fondant here is given another twist by the addition of a Basil Sorbet, making this a must-try to end off the meal with.Service is outstanding, warm yet competent – without even having to ask, they took the initiative to split the Lobster bisque that was part of the set menu, so that the ala carte diner could partake in the soup as well

I've been a regular at Absinthe from the day it opened on Bukhit Pasoh Road, to the current new location on Boat Quay, coming for dinner with my wife and daughter every week-end.Both locations are good, but I think the new one is better as the restaurant is now on 2 floors, allowing for smaller rooms instead of the big single room on Bukhit Pasoh. Meaning more privacy. There is also an outdoor sitting area if the weather cooperates. The location on Boat Quay is also great as a business venue, virtually a 5 minutes walk from Raffles Place (5 minutes if you walk very slowly).The atmosphere is great. Clean and tidy. The lighting is not too bright, which I like. And again because the restaurant is organized in a few small rooms, it is always very quiet. Perfect for a young couple celebrating an anniversary, perfect for business, perfect for families etc... I am quite anal when it comes to eating in clean places: this restaurant is very clean.The service is outstanding. A mix of French and local waiters, in both cases very polite, always ready to chat if the occasion arises but not "invading" at all. You will be treated like a real Prince in this restaurant. Also, on a number of occasion I called at the last minute to make a reservation when the restaurant was quite full already, and Vincent was able to "squeeze" us in nicely. Just ask politely and they should be able to accommodate.The food.It's quite simple, there hasn't been a dish I haven't enjoyed. The quantities are just perfect for our appetite, allowing us to enjoy a 3 course dinner without feeling full after the entree. The fish dishes are particularly tasty, and in particular the few variations of the new seafood plater.For families, Francois always accommodate special requests for young kids, like pastas, ravioles de romans etc etc... and again always in adequate portions. At least to our taste.The wine list is obviously skewed towards French wines, which I presume won't be a problem for patrons interested in a French restaurant. The wine list is a little bit smaller than it used to be at Bukhit Pasoh, but all the great classics are there in particular the white Burgundies. You will find there a bottle you like. From an affordable classic Meursault, to a sophisticated Clos Vougeot to celebrate a very special occasion.Something else to note: Francois organizes cooking lessons during week-ends which is totally awesome for housewives - like mine - who would like to have a crack at French food. Not only very educational, but also very fun to attend with cocktail tasting etc...One last thing: the menu rotates regularly every couple of months, so for the regulars like us, we never get bored of the food there. There's always something new to try.In conclusion: a very quiet restaurant, great food and awesome service. My wife and I tried virtually every classy restaurant in Singapore, and Absinthe comes first with no close second

I went to Asbsinthe a few times, for lunch and dinner, inside the restaurant and on terrace, for business lunches and family dinner
This is the perfect blend of creative French food, good location, and very professional staff

Love everything about Absinthe! Food, service, atmosphere and the Fondant is to die for ... Boat Quay a great location!

I have been so many times to this restaurant that I lost count. It ranks among the best in town for consistently greeting you with warmth of atmosphere, great service and impeccable food. My most recent visit was with a large group of friends for a masterfully organised french lunch in one of the restaurant's large function room culminating above Boat Quay. As usual, the combination of well executed and traditional French dishes along with the fantastic view won over all my friends. Most other visits were dinners with 4 to 8 participants.The restaurant caters for a variety of atmosphere whether you prefer to be relaxed outdoor (warning, this is hot and humid Singapore!), enjoy the proximity of the bar area, a more formal ambiance in one of the main indoor area or even the luxury of a private room.I can't remember the last time I looked at the menu: quite frankly, I simply rely on the staff to systematically surprise us with fresh arrivals and exceptional quality ingredients combined by the Chef into delicious meals.The wine list is logically concentrating on France, is large enough to offer plenty of choice both with taste and price and contains some tempting deals for the knowledgeable

Having visited many restaurants in Singapore i must say Absinthe is on the toppermost of my list of favourite restaurants.The dinner last weekend was the best i had in a long long time. An extensive menu selections of many of my favourites. The service was flawless. Staff were very knowledgable and friendly. My guest was also very impressed with the nice decor and the overall warmness of the atmosphere.We started off with the oysters which were fresh and succulent. Loved it. From the presentation of the dishes that we were served you can tell that the chefs put in alot of care attention to details. The Foie Gras terrine was a World above all. You wouldn't find anywhere else better than this. The Lobster Bisque was served in the right temperature with a nice scent of Cognac. Our favourite of the evening was the Wagyu Cote de Boeuf served just the way we wanted. Bloody! Though we were filled to brim, we were not going let the evening off without the sweets. I had the Duo of Magnum and my guest the Chocolate Fondant which were recommended by Vincent, le maitre' d. Excellent choice! We almost die and gone to Heaven!We were further pampered with shot of Armagnac on the house from Chef Francois with our coffees. That really sealed off the evening! Will certainly return for more:)Thank you Absinthe, the team for the wonderful evening

Been to absinthe a few times now and finally made a point for a review. Food there never disappointed; fresh ingredients were used and produce were of good quality. Particularly liked their Black Cod and Beef for mains; cooked just right and very tasty. Their ravioli is nice and light, which i enjoyed very much. A nice selection of oysters that are freshly shucked. And the most delicious duck confit I´ve ever had!I like it that the food there is never overly pretentious, unlike some other restaurants I´ve been. It´s relatively straight forward food with good ingredients and simple nice plating. Bread there is served soft-centre and warm which is a great plus! Especially when slathered in butter! :P I must say that is one luxury that is not so common even in the nice restaurants that I´ve visited in Paris! Of coz I´ve had my share of suprises when I ordered the Pigeon thinking it would be more HK style (silly me), and then realising it´s the real French way (rare on the inside). Slight adventure when I tried it while resisting asking for it to be cooked more thoroughly. It turned out very tasty, albeit not what I expected. Dessert wise, my love for creme brulee have never been so satisfied! Smooth, creamy and absolutely to die for. Every time I visited they´ve suprised me with a new flavour of creme. Absolutely LOVE it. I swear I can eat it all day long. The ambiance is nice, the Fine Dining inside is fully air conditioned and slightly posh, they also have a private dining room which I´ve never tried, but looks interesting. The Alfresco Dining by the river gives a very laid back and romantic atmosphere. But my favourite spot is where the oyster bar sits, that´s where I call the best of both worlds, lightly air conditioned while still very much open air, a cozy and familiar way to dine with friends.I´ve been there with friends, with my Dad and my bf. And we´ve all had an enjoyable time, every time. Overall, I´d definitely go back again, and again, and.. probably again!Word of caution though, some of the dishes can be rather french. The French do eat some pretty grostesque stuff, like raw beef, raw pigeon, skin, fats, livers etc. so take caution when ordering! But if you do accidently order something ¨unexpected¨ (like me. ops!), give it a try anyway, it may turn out to be unexpectedly tasty

The term “cream of the crop” or en Francais “crème de la crème” as it suggest, is what Absinthe offers, the palatial splendour of French cuisine Our image of “Fine Dining”, an immaculate interior décor with bleach white table cloths to top-notch service. Just as it defines, Absinthe exudes the finest in food, service and ambience Now, for those of you searching for a culinary French experience, look no further than Absinthe Guaranteed that you will not be disappointed!The 2-storey shophouse restaurant is conveniently located along the Singapore River bank. You can also dine al fresco facing a spectacular view of the Singapore CBD (central business district) skyline.Started the evening with our entrees, the famous Asperges Blanches (White Asparagus), which is essentially steamed seasonal white asparagus (perfectly cooked), house-smoked duck breast, zesty hollandaise and parmesan crumbs. My friend had the Saint-Jacques, which consisted of soft fleshy and mildly sweet flavoured carpaccio of Hakkaido Scallops, zingy lemon dressing, aquitaine caviar and fresh fava beans (truly remarkable).Next was the main course, started with Canard Confit, (french duck leg confit), sarladaise, complemented with potatoes, mushrooms and Madiran wine sauce. The flavour of the sauce balanced the richness of the delish tender duck incredibly well. My buddy had the Cote de Boeuf, Wagyu rib of beef and Epoisse Gratin and baby veggies and Bearnaise. The dish was absolutely delectable and faultless. Beef was prepared to perfection This was a feast well worth it.Last but not the least, we made room for our fave desserts Had the sinful Fondant, just to “die for”, with rich strawberry-rhubarb ice cream and of course, the “notorious” Crème Brulee, simply divine. It was a glorious indulgence of sweetsBravo to Chef Francois and his team. There’s no doubt that Absinthe will continue to thrive and remain the best French restaurant in SG. Bravo and merci beaucoup for an amazing “food” trip as always O and yes, we are Absinthe’s regular patrons…how could you not Can’t wait to come back for our next treatA bientot:

Had a fabulous dining experience at Absinthe as expected and four of us enjoyed ourselves eating and people watching along Boat Quay.Chef Francois never fails to impress with his food creations each time. Loved the Antartica fish sashimi starter with pomegranate and special dressing!Look forward to return soon

Delighted to find this gem at the 'nicer" end of Boat Quay...Lovely spot and a range of places to sit (inside/outside/riverside/seafood counter/chef's table). Bit bewildering...We chose upstairs as we were worried about being too hot.Oysters followed by an excellent cote de boeuf.. wonderful.Scallops followed by a lovely rack of lamb... We were all happy...Advice on the wine was great as the recommendation was cheaper than the one I wanted to order.Dessert and coffee by the river.Lovely evening... We will definitely return. Simply great

Found this restaurant through the apfs website. There are not many independent restaurants that open for Saturday lunch in the downtown area, so we were lucky to find this one in Boat Quay.Food was good, but not the blow-your-mind and send-you-raving type of quality. The lamb rack came out more rare than medium. The best dish was the sticky date pudding. Overall, good enough for a quiet Saturday lunch. The restaurant was empty until 1.30pm, when two other tables were filled. Hopefully dinner is more lively.Parking tends to be quite expensive in the downtown area, so we were lucky to find this open-air carpark that could be accessed through Capenter Street and Upper Circular Road. It is a less than 5 minute walk to the Absinthe Restaurant across the South Bridge Road

My husband and I celebrated our 5th anniversary with several friends there, together our little one. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated. All the dishes were nice. They even made a special dish for my little one (who's only 10 mths old) on our request. The most important thing is the price is VERY reasonable, especially when it's in Singapore! Will definitely come back!!! And you must try their madeleines!!

One of the better restaurants in Singapore, get a table inside upstairs if you want to avoid the heat. Pricey, but that is typical of good restaurants in Singapore. This was a business dinner, very suitable.

Came here during Singapore Restaurant Week and so had the set menu (so not as expensive as a la carte).We both enjoyed the food - particularly the scallops. All the dishes were nicely presented.Good wine choices, but like the food, also expensive.I did, however, have a bad tummy the next day. Of course I cant be sure it came from their food, so I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.....

Food: 1. the spring chicken - how would you feel when you struggle for 30mins trying to cut the meat off the bone? Isn't it supposed to be tender and melted in your mouth? 2. Duck leg - to be fair, the best dish I've ordered this evening. However, the saltiest I have ever tasted. 3. Pan fried foie gras - the skin isn't crispy enough and the sauce isn't enough. 4. Chocolate lava cake - lava cake came in the solid form. Speechless, totally. Else, 1. aircon spoilt - not their fault becos I reverved an indoor table; 2. The French waiter passed me the dessert menu while I was waiting for my mains - stunned. Had a small chat with the waiter who claimed it's still run by the same chef, so I left nothing to reply.

Location and atmosphere are excellent. I ordered the tasting menu which was very well executed. I am particular about ordering fish in most places as it is generally overcooked, overworked and disappointing. Here the menu included a carpaccio of Antarctic toothfish and scallops. The scallops were hands down the best i have ever had. Thick, juicy, moist, perfectly seasoned and expertly cooked.The other courses were all equally as great and service was also very good. I had a reservation and was given the option of dining in or out and I chose outside. The view was terrific and the cool breeze made the experience very enjoyable. Unfortunately, a table of half drunk financiers were eventually seated next to me and that is where the pleasant evening ended for me. Foul language,, loud brutish behaviour and inappropriate LOUD topics of conversation prompted my other dining neighbour to ask them politely to be aware that there were ladies present, etc. I do not blame the restaurant for this behaviour but it did end the night for me. I would have enjoyed a nightcap etc as the view and service was so nice, but I had had enough of my neighbours. Too bad

Absinthe is a good choice for those who have come to appreciate the style of expensive nouvelle cuisine restaurants.Within that context it is what one might like and enjoy.In my opinion,nouvelle cuisine is really something invented for an overseas audience which one seldom sees in France,where the traditional,and to my mind much more satisfying,bistro tradition holds sway.The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant and the service is competent,but the food is expensive.Starters were mainly seafood based and were just okay,if expensive.My main course of rabbit,which contained four minuscule thumb-nails of tasty meat,was over S$40.In Paris you can get a very substantial portion of rabbit done casserole style for a third of the price.This was more of an "amuse bouche" than a main course.The cheese selection for dessert,again tasty morsels of cheese,likewise gave the impression that cheese is currently rationed.The wine selection was a plus point in a town where some fancy restaurants have a terrible policy of offering only very expensive and over-priced wines.We were able to order an excellent and reasonably priced Sancerre and a less excellent but drinkable Bordeaux for affordable cost

My husband and I recently had dinner here while we were staying in Singapore.It started off bad when the taxi dropped us off at the other end of Boat Quay (do not get a red and white or a blue taxi, use black ones only) and there we were, all dressed up, me in heels, having to walk quiet a distance amongst very casual areas, on a very hot night, finally reaching the restaurant.As one can imagine, we were rather p....d off by then.We were greeted welcomely, up stairs we go (more walking), finally to our table.From there on, all was great. Service very good, food beautiful french cuisine and a very pleasant evening. When we were ready to leave, our waiter and the head waiter, personally walked us to the taxi rank (2 doors up and up the stairs, where we should have been dropped off the first time!)Now, that is great service.Thank you and look forward to dining at Absinthe on our next visit to Singapore

I had high expectations for this place, because I've heard good things about it. When we arrived, we were seated quickly and we were the first patrons in the section. We asked for some iced (tap) water and the wine list to start, but our water was only served after five other tables were seated AND served their expensive bottled water. Our wine list only arrived after a second request. The server asked if we need recommendations, and when we said we want a light fruity red, he recommended something that he called "grape juice"... way to sell your wines (NOT!). Not impressed.Fortunately the food made up for the lacklustre service. The king prawn with eggplant had two large sesame-crusted prawns that were cooked perfectly, and large bits of prawn in the eggplant. The seasoning was perfect, just restrained enough to highlight the briny flavor of the prawns and the sweetness of eggplants.The soup (onions with caviar cream and chorizo) was served in a lovely mason jar, at the correct temperature. The cream had an oceany tang, and smokiness from the bits of chorizo. They complement the sweetness of the onion broth well. Again, the seasoning was perfect.My main course was a meltingly tender beef shoulder, evidently from slow cooking. The connective tissues were reduced to gelatinous, mouth-coating perfection. The beef portioning was just enough as a main course, but I thought the accompaniments (ONE cherry tomato, two muchrooms, one tiny disc of grilled polenta) were on the miserly side. My friend's plate was even missing the polenta (but was quickly rectified).Dessert was a winner. The white chocolate mousse was not overwhelmingly sweet (like white chocolate usually is), and the passionfruit, mango and pomelo soup it was served in was an excellent counter to the white chocolate. It was tangy, thick, and luxuriously refreshing.I'll be back for the proper a la carte menu. I hope they read this and improve the service. I'm usually a good tipper, but I want to be impressed before I part with $20. I was going to tip $10 on this visit but my dining companions convinced me otherwise

I've been a big fan of Absinthe for years owing to their impeccable service, excellent food and reasonable prices. However, I recently booked a specific table only to show up and have the bimbo hostess tell me that she had accidentally given the table to someone else and then make a silly (and arrogant) apology. The staff has completely lost the plot and I fear the end is near for this place. Only a complete housecleaning of the incompetent staff can save the place. Bon chance.

First time visiting Absinthe, heard so much about it, couldn't wait to try this place!I really enjoyed the starter - thought the flavours worked really well together, when u have the citrusy-flavoured scallops and the salmon roe mousse, with the quinoa and asparagus and seaweed. Next came the onion soup with chorizo and caviar. An unlikely combination that worked so well! It was like a surprise party in your mouth! It was just the right portion as well. Mains - The black cod dish was served in casing. When the dish was unwrapped at the table, u get a nice whiff of the shellfish jus, which tasted like a yummy, thick lobster bisque. The seafood was cooked to perfection. The duck confit was the highlight of my night. Sooo delicious! The meat just melted in my mouth. The wine sauce tasted really good with the duck. The meal was topped off with a mango/passionfruit dessert with a thick white chocolate cream. U cant have one without the other, as the creaminess of the white choc rounds off the tartness of the mango/passionfruit.Service was great in the restaurant. Nice smiley and professional people working there. Our lovely waitress told us that Restaurant Week was a great opportunity for them to showcase their menu and also to see how they can improve - a fantastic attitude for a restaurant!Overall, I enjoyed my experience with this restaurant alot as each dish has many elements to it, and the flavours complemented very well. Full marks for presentation. The food really shined through! It is a place I would visit again for sure

We had lunch at Absinthe during Singapore Restaurant Week. This is a restaurant that we had been keen to visit for some time, and restaurant week provided the motivation. We were warmly greeted on arrival by a delightful young French woman. My husband walks with the aid of a stick and she and other members of staff were very attentive in making sure he climbed the stairs safely to the main restaurant. The restaurant is on two floors and both rooms are beautifully decorated. The first level has mainly booths and the upper floor has mainly small tables. The tables are beautifully set with linen tablecloths and napkins and nice glassware and silverware complete the French restaurant experience. You could believe that you were in Paris, if not for the view of the Singapore River rather the Seine outside the windows.We chose the set lunch for 38 SGD and added some oysters from the a la carte, the strangely named Prat-Ar-Coum, from Brittany. The oysters were magnificent, probably the best we have ever had and we eat a lot of oysters! Both of us had the prawn starter, which was a delicious, Asian flavoured dish that did not disappoint. We had chosen a bottle of Pouilly FumÃ© to accompany the lunch and it complemented the first course beautifully. We did not look at the main wine list, but were pleased with our choice of bottle at 68 SGD, which was served at just the right temperature. I loved my main course of duck confit, but my husband was disappointed in his "French style fish and chips". I will say why in a moment, after I answer the question as to why I rated Absinthe an Excellent despite this issue. It is all to do with how the restaurant handled things, which was to immediately take the feedback on board, without any defensiveness on the part of the chef, who came immediately to our table to talk with us. The chef is French, charming and clearly very gifted in the kitchen. The problem with the fish and chip dish was not the taste, it was that the waiter had not been properly briefed on the description of how it was cooked and served. It is a brand new dish on the menu, served for the first time the day we went, and it was not described properly when we asked about it. That said, the fish - black cod as opposed to the ubiquitous Dory in Singapore - was delicious. The chef was keen to hear our comments about the dish and also keen to make up for the inconvenience, with a delicious glass of wine and the offer of some cheese at the end of our meal. This is exactly how a top class restaurant deals with customers and I applaud both the chef and Absinthe for handling it in this way. Before I forget, the dessert of white chocolate mousse with mango syrup was amazing. I had feared that the syrup might be too sweet, but it was just perfect. We will most definitely be back

Fantastic menu, food, champagne and wine for this Christmas eve. We all highly enjoyed . Faultless.I have been many times and I have never been disappointed with the food and service. Great place.

Hosted a gathering of friends for my birthday in their Private room.Ambience is outstanding - high ceilings, lovely decor, private bar area and toilet facilities alongside a wonderful balcony overlooking the city skyline and Singapore River.Food - Chef Francois and team put together a set menu inclusive of vegetarian options that was first class in taste, presentation and value. Highlights according to the table were a beautifully cooked Foie Gras dish, Iberico pork and a stunning rendition of a prawn cocktail. Cheese board was another highlight.Service - in a word outstanding. Hugo and team were at hand whenever required but unobtrusive throughout. When a guest advised he had a food allergy, the team leapt in to advise the kitchen and a delicious replacement was immediately forthcoming.Couldn't have asked for more on my birthday and will definitely be back again soo

This restaurant was highly recommended because of its wines. The wines were expensive and the food was nicely presented, but I have had equally as good in cheaper restaurants. I felt the staff were good but their heart wasn't in the job. They were very pleasant. I like to feel welcome when you are paying big dollars, they made you feel like the sooner you ate and left the better. WilI I go back probably not
4
This review covers my last two visits, which came in quick succession. The food was fantastic on both occasions, although a rotation of a few specials would really add some freshness to the menu. The service is always reasonably attentive but sometimes tries to hard and sometimes is missing in action - wine glasses should always be kept full if you want diners to buy another bottle.All in all this restaurant remains in my top 3 French restaurants in Singapore
4
It was a pleasure at Absinthe, the staffs were friendly and helpful when we needed some recommendations. We started with wine and some oysters for the evening, the oysters were tasty and fresh even for myself who isn't an oyster fan. For entrees we had the star of the night, the foie gras terrine. it just have the melts in mouth sensation and don't see little of the warm brioche, try it and you would be impressed. my people wonders why do I kept attacking the little brioche until they tried it. ;) for mains we tried the duck leg confit, its tasty too and looked biggest portion compared to the sea bass and Lapin. The Lapin was a delight! not chewy like my past experience with rabbit. For dessert I had huile d'olive but guessed it had too much raspberries on the side otherwise very interesting combination of dessert
4
This is an excellent, high-class french restaurant in the great tradition.Service & food was excellent: it was the best duck confit I had eaten in a long time... or ever. The seared foie gras was very good, but I'd been spoiled recently by larger portions at another restaurant.I also visited the cheese menu, which I don't normally do, but there were some lovely creamy soft cheeses to choose from & was given an excellent chablis to go with it.Crêpe suzette was nice to finish, although they didn't flambé it - the waiter said that was something they didn't do in Singapore, which seems a bit disappointing...Overall a great meal, although the travel expenses took a bit of a battering: definitely something for a treat, but almost certainly the most refined offering on Boat Quay
5
Nothing beats Absinthe's freshly made pan fried Foie Gras.... or house made foie gras terrine.. feeling hungry just thinking of it.... and served with freshly baked warm brioche!! At least this is what my 6 year old says. I couldn't agree more!I am sure most people wouldn't consider it a family restaurant but my 3 1/2 year old and 6 1/2 year old love coming here sitting outside and fine dining with mama and papa. They love the food, service, view and the house made ice cream!! This is our monthly family treat. Given the plentitude of restaurants in Singapore now that serve over priced average food I would say Absinthe serves top notch French food at very affordable prices. You can have a 3 course meal with wine for under $100 and half that price for lunch menus. The ingredients are incredibly fresh and the ambience is unbeatable especially sitting outside with one of the best views in Singapore.I have come here many a times with friends, husband, children and I have never been disappointed, in fact, I leave in anticipation for our next meal in Absinthe
4
Absinthe in its new venue on Boat Quay is miles better than the previous location. Team dinner the a few weeks ago served 7 or 8 great dishes which everyone enjoyed. service was a bit slow at times but hey... it's Singapore. After two disappointing experiences at the "old" Absinthe this was a real improvement and would certainly return for dinner again soon

For more reviews, visit ms-skinnyfatF&B restaurants are a dime a dozen in Singapore these days and most don't even survive past a year. Which is why Absinthe is great, because despite its lack of publicity and even a change of location, it has been doing good since i last wrote about it 2 years ago (read about it here).We sampled a couple of dishes from the ala carte menu. Pictures show tasting portions.Hamachi ($26), carpaccio of marinated yellow tail kingfish with Aquitaine caviar, cucumber and baby cress. A simple refreshing start to the night.Saint Jacques ($26), seared Hokkaido scallops, braised daikon, wakame and lemon thyme emulsion. Lemon line. This dish really whets the appetite with the tangy citrus. The braised daikon, while being thoroughly flavored, still maintained some bite to it. The scallop was perfectly executed with a light pinkish center and lovely browned crust.Next, the Foie Gras Poêlé ($29), Chef Francois’ rendition of pan-fried foie gras served with warm blinis and Morello cherries. I found it little on the oily side and the blinis soaked up all the excess oil. Needless to say, I left it after a bite. If foie gras is your thing, opt for the Foie Gras Terrine ($29), layered with smoked duck breast and served with warm brioche (read it here). It's certainly a hot favorite.The Bisque ($15), lobster (of course) was a little on the bland side. A hint of cognac was detected but did not lend any flavors to the soup.From the mains, the Canard (lunch $40, dinner $42) is a French duck leg confit should not be missed. Nice crispy skin with a well flavored and moist duck meat. Comes served with Sarladaise potatoes, mushrooms and Madiran wine sauce.We ended dinner on a sweet note with the Vanilla Madeleines ($15), freshly baked-to-order and accompanied with Valrhona chocolate mousse. Freshly baked goods are always good but this changed my mind about the boring madeleines
5
I have been to Absinthe so many times but each time is a thing of gastronomic wonder unto itself. The food is the best French food I have had in town and it is constantly different and thrilling to try. The wine selection is impressive. And we love the ambience which is only accentuated by the amazing staff with an impeccable level of professional service
4
It is a bit mind blowing they moved to boat quay as the place is a dump for shady bars, but the dinner was a nice experience for sure.
Set menu is good and reasonnably priced. It'll make for a nice evening for sure!

Great food great service feel sorry was difficult to eat outdoor due to the very bad weather we will be Back especially for the seafood and the reasonable price for the wines

My experiences of the quality of food on Clarke Quay have been poor, and the riverside has been a bye-word for overselling by touts dressed as Singapore Airlines cabin crew offering jugs of Tiger Beer at happy hour prices and their special prawn fried rice. Absinthe breaks the mold. The ambiance is chic with strong branding, a green theme and a mix of upmarket decor and slightly quirky aquamarine furniture in a prime location. The pricing is high, as you would expect of a joint which boats a Beluga Boudoir, but if you can get past the 50% mark up for the location, the food is tasty. Four of the five of us had the beef tenderloin with foie gras sauce and "creamy polenta" and nobody had any complaints. Absinthe is not a vegetabley sort of place, so the beef was just that, a squat cylinder of juicy meat with nary a green leaf to be seen. The bread basket was really good, though, with crispy little rolls still warm and soft inside. I had the figs for dessert - $15 for two figs and a scoop of cream is expensive, but they were tasty and we were looking out over the river and the Asian Civilisations Museum on a quiet and clear evening. The wine list was extensive and was surprisingly good value - $75 for a cab sav.The wait staff maybe needed to be more attentive as on a Monday night with only 15 covers filled I shouldn't have to wave from our table of five to get their attention. But no complaints

Excellent restaurant. We have lived 2 years in Singapore and tried many restaurants but this one stands out. Food is excellent (French menu), service is impeccable. It's in an area in town where you find more casual restaurants but Absinthe is high end and well worth the money. Don't be misled by the look of the rest of the street and come inside. Not only the food quality is superior but the whole experience and atmosphere makes an evening very special. Do try it

Located along Singapore River, the outdoor seating offers one of the best view in Singapore - A great place for first time tourist in Singapore. Set lunch is S$45 (inclusive of GST and Service Fess) 6 course dinner is S$115. Corkage is S$40, but they do have a good selection of wine. Both the main course of Black Cob and Pork were excellent. There was some service gaps and the ambiance could be improved if they pay more attention to details by keeping back-of-house equipment out of sight. The dessert of Philibon Melon was a disappointment, as it lacks favorite, nothing like the honey sweet Yubari King melon from Hakkaido, Japa

Try the Menu Absinthe with the Carpaccio of Ocean trout, the scallops, Foie grass, seared Iberico Pork. Quite memorable, no room for the french farmed cheeses. Book a table outside near the river with a most wonderful view. The service was very good, and the only (small) negative was the Philibon melon for dessert was not fully ripe. By SG standard at S$ 98++ with a excellent coffee and petits four this was good value. Recommended

Located in Boat Quay, nice romantic ambience upstairs. Good duck confit and lobster bisque and sommelier recommended good range of wines to accompany the meal. We were there for a meal with business partners, the dining room was pretty empty. It was more a venue for couples feeling romantic. Prices for mains were at least 40sgd plus each Definitely not a venie for everyday fare and for occasions there are more romantuc places with views

We were guests at a private dinner party. The private dining section on the 3rd level has a balcony overlooking the river and the CDB skyline. Great location for pre dinner drinks. Quality of food however was very inconsistent. Meats were over-cooked and ended up feeling leathery - epic struggle cutting and chewing. . Fish was ok. Goose liver was mixed - some guests had theirs over seared and others were under cooked. Service was attentive, but staff were not trained! e.g. New wines were poured before the glass was consumed (and thus inadvertently blended) with previous bottles of wine. What a waste as the wines were pretty decent. Overall, a very inconsistent quality of food and level of service - disappointing for the guests and rather embarrassing for the hosts.

I've visited twice, and both times felt like I was treated like royalty. The main dining rooms truly are special here in Singapore and you can't help but feel transported to an atmospheric classic brasserie in Paris. Pity about the food though. It's inconsistent at best. I had one great meal followed up by a disappointing one. Come here for the wonderful room and hope that your chef that day delivers the goods

Me and my gf went to Absinthe for a weekday lunch. The clean and simple design makes a good comfortable ambience. We went for the 3-course lunch menu. The foie gras appetizer is to die-for! This pan-grilled/fried liver has a crispy outer layer with a melt-in-your-mouth inside. The main course and dessert are great as well. The service was decent as well. They scrapped off the bread crumbs on the table, and they were polite throughout the meal. The portion of the meals may look petite and I thought I am going for second round after this meal, but it manages to fill up my stomach. A really nice place to enjoy good food with our significant others
5
Beautiful location with a great view we had dinner in the private room and the view at the balcony just amazing food excellent and a special 3 stars to the service thanks and will be back
5

We booked a private room. And a set menu was given. Service - well below par. Poorly trained. Examples. Red wine put into ice. Not the white wine. Red wine poured into white wine glass and vice versa. Asked for English tea got some indescribable bath water. Chamomile maybe. Food was very slow. Courses took forever to arrive. Prolonged agony. Always the wrong thing served. Wrong cutlery always given. Food - Average. For the price. Below average. Bread good and plentiful. Entrees best of the menu. Main - Fish ok. Steak way too much pepper. Wine - Way over priced and for the price below average. Best part was leaving. And going home to have some cheese and crackers. One restaurant I will never go to. Unusual for Singapore. A bad experience. For the price a shocker. Avoid. Try Indochine across the river

i had made the reservation as my wife met the chef in one of the Die Dietrich cooking class and like the dish they made. Then I came to the Travel Advisor website and saw several bad reviews in the past several days. I almost canceled the reservation but decided to give it a try. I know different people have different expectations and hence, I needed to at least take the risk given there were a lot more positive comments over the long haul. Also, the bad comments hopefully inspired the people to do even better.Upon entering, I was glad to see there was a full room of guest which to me was a good sign. We were glad we decided to try the place ourselves. We opted for the set gustation menu. The standouts were the lobster ravioli, the foie gras and the lab. The lobster ravioli was a refreshing start to the dinner. I had tried to minimize eating foie gras but given it was a special celebration, I went for it and enjoyed it thoroughly . The lamb was also delicious and tender. And for S$98, it was relatively good value. All in all, a great dinner experience. We plan to be back to try other items in the menu

This was my third time and the first time at the new location .The view on the river is nice but the neighbourhood is full of third category restaurants . The service is always as good and the wine list really exceptional for a wine lover but i was a bit disappointed by the lack of athmosphere and not really convinced by what i choose on the menu . I expected something better

Both my wife and I had heard good things about Absinthe. I must admit that we were extremely disappointed. We are both very fond of French food; what we experienced at the Absinthe was a joke! Both our meals and main courses lacked flavor, as well as taste. Furthermore, service was just ridiculous, you get 2 small pieces of bread (and they call themselves French), the waiters keep interrupting you to try and get rid of every single "empty" thing they can see on your table; and you do NOT get shown which wine is poured into your glass when you order something by the glass from their wine menu! It is like ordering wine at a bar... this is a huge disgrace! This place is simply a rip-off wannabe French restaurant, with no experience of French cuisine and service. I cook better food at home for a tenth of the price!Positive: great view and location
3
We went to absinthe because we had had a memorable, faultless meal last year in it's old location.Service started well, as lady at reception who had taken our booking the previous day is really friendly and efficient and showed us to a great table.We waited a while before we were given menus, and an awful lot longer before we were given the wine list. When we asked for the wine list, as we were worried our food would come before we had the wine, the waiter said we would have to wait until another table had finished with it!!We even waited for the bill!! With a prime table that they could have turned over!The food was absolutely delicious, particularly the fish dishes. Red snapper with spelt and cod? with risotto were cooked to perfection, and as for the lobster ravoli entree . . devine.However, the casual service throughout let down the chef's skill. A meal out is more than food, it is the total experience, and the experience left us disappointed
5
It is great French food, you will not be disappointed. The menu is a perfect selection of great French dishes, lots of favorites and the occasional left field option - nothing, and I really do mean nothing, will leave you disappointed.
2
We've been in a busy night ,S Valantine's day, 30 minute wait for one table if it wasn't for the kind and polite lady at the reception it would be 1 star!!the only person spent time to make us comfortable! Food was ok but small portion and too expensive. Bad service, too slow, waiters and managers robotic and arrogant, they did not have any more word for us than " ok" ! Won't go back!!
1
We had not been served our main course by 10.20pm. We asked for the wine menu FOUR times, We asked for our water glasses to be filled FOUR times. Nobody seemed capable or willing enough to deal with what appeared to be a problem in the kitchen. 'Just let then wait' was the mentality. Well - I shall never go there again. What arrogance. What a ruined evening. How appalling
3
For the price you are paying, $44, for a main course you shouldn't feel as though you just had an entree size portion and still be hungry. Especially when need to add gst and service charge into the mix. And the service was slow. 45mins to get a coffee is just poor and not acceptable. Won't be rushing back to this place despite its reputation.
5
Great food, great service, great chef! The food is yummy beyond a doubt, and having taken friends/colleagues there on various occasions, I am assured this isn't my bias talking (It IS my favourite restaurant). The staff are extremely welcoming and are able to competently talk you through the menu and make recommendations (not always a given, even at the fancier establishments!) - I've requested vegetarian/pescetarian substitutes on many a visit which they have accommodated graciously. The new location in Boat Quay is lovely for a great night out, be it with friends or as a couple, but they also do a great lunch menu so it's worth popping around to if you work in the area or have colleagues visiting from out of town
5
We celebrated a birthday at Absinthe and the experience was overall very positive. I can't find anything to fault the restaurant with. Staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and could describe what you would expect if you ordered the dish. Specifically, when asked "what's that like?" they wouldn't just repeat the ingredients on the menu -- they would talk about its preparation, the taste, what to liken it with, and so on. Very warm waiters and very attentive. My glass was never close to empty and they had a great handle on the place.Absinthe is located in Boat Quay, and although the first floor can probably be noisy (as well as the outside seating area overlooking the water), the 2nd floor is very pleasant and feels like a totally different place. A nice little pocket in an otherwise busy and noisy part of Sing.Would certainly recommend to others. But, it's a little pricey
5
Have heard good things about Absinthe so when we had out-of-town visitors, we decided to take them there. Before we got there, we already had high expectations for the evening, and am glad to say that the experience at Absinthe did not disappoint.Food was good. Drinks were good. Service was good
5
Food was great. Started with the foie gras which was cooked perfectly and balanced well by the tartness of the cooked berries and thin piece of bread. Continued to the steak which was seasoned so well that I barely touched the bearnaise that came with it. I had initially declared the steak too big to finish but ended up eating every bit!Molten chocolate cake was good. While it could have been a little more molten, it was obvious that the quality of the chocolate was good. Service was polite and excellent too. If I had but one complaint, it would be that the complimentary bread could've been warmer and softer. Will definitely be back for more
5
Had dinner at Absinthe last night. We had the degustation menu and the food was delicious and well prepared. My wife's fois gras was undercooked and had to go back, but that was the only problem we had. the rest of them were done to perfection. The wine list was not too long but pricy. In the end we settled for the house wine (both white and red) and enjoyed it. The service was professional and very friendly. Towards the end the chef came out to speak with the guests, which is a nice touch. The new location is really good and you can dine al fresco right by the river. Certainly a must try in Singapore
5
Absinthe 2.0 has it nailed - the last location got it right but the amazing chef here and staff in the new location have it going so much better. Attention to detail hasn't been lost at all, as someone who spent several years living in France, the food is beyond delicious. The team make you feel super special no water what the location. Top tip, there's great seating by the river you need to ask for, or up on the top floor a small private balcony that's really romantic. Book it, you wont regret it
5
Absinthe is one of Singapore's best restaurants.
Recently, they have relocated.
The quality of food and service remains the same.
I recommend you visit for lunch, to take advantage of the excellent value prix fixe lunch menu.
Highly recommended
5
our lunch was simple and very well prepare wines are reasonable and the service is high class
it s a kind of place where you feel like you are in France well done Absinthe team
5
we had dinner last thursday
great outdoor great food great service the Foie Gras its amazing and I like the cheeses platter we will be back for more
5
I enjoyed my lunch experience at Absinthe very much. The food is delicious. I had a starter of avocado with prawns--definitely whets one's appetite., followed by a main dish of perfectly seared seabream. The dessert is so pretty--raspberry sorbet! I took a tour of the interior of the restaurant. Spread over 3 floors of the shophouse, each floor features a different colour theme. Nonetheless, the decor of all 3 floors remains very elegant & feminine
4
Came here for a relaxing Friday lunch. Indoors was already fully booked but the tables outside were very pleasant with a nice view of the river and passers-by.The set lunch is very nice but the portions are really much to small for the average Singapore diner. Starters included (a small fraction of) an avocado and prawn with salad (one leaf!) and the smallest piece of fois gras I have ever been served sitting on a single mini blini (dare I say it, from one of those frozen packets of blinis from the local deli?). Mains were also microscopic - three of us had the Iberico pork with lentils which was delicious, another had the sea bream, but still feeling famished we then ordered the cote de beouf (for two) which was beautiful and came with delicious vegetables. This was all washed down with one of the house whites, a perfectly acceptable Pouilly Fume at SGD 55 per bottle and a house red, a Mischief & Mayhem Pinot Noir also at SGD 55. The rest of the wine list is much dearer.........Service was excellent and helped to make this a lovely relaxed lunch
5
Singapore is a terrific place with endless dining options, but we always visit Absinthe now at Boat Quay. This reputable french restaurant is hard to fault. Francois and the boys really know how to treat their patrons, and that's reflected by the popularity of the venue. The food is always excellent and the wine list is robust. On this occasion I endulged on foie gras and a perfectly cooked lamb rack, both could not be faulted. The whole Absinthe experience is what dining should be about, terrific staff, nice ambience and outstanding menu
3
I went there for dinner with a few friends on Sunday. The restaurant is surrounded by a lot of seafood/local restaurants, it doesnt really fit well. The starters were not bad, the lobster bisque was full of flavours. I had Cod for main course, lacks in flavour, could have more seasoning in it. The risotto comes with the cod was nice. Desserts were quite authentic. I could just feel they had shortage of manpower. Only 1 staff serving about 20 guests on one floor and an assistant who only serves bread and clear.
5
It's rare to find such a hidden gem in Boat Quay, but Absinthe is one place you must try. From the moment you walk in you're greeted by the friendly French waiters. The view from the restaurant overlooks The Fullerton Bay and Marina Bay Sands. Absinthe has a great wine list which caters for both entry level and high end wine drinkers. I didn't have an entree, which I'm now regretting, but on the positive side it means I get to go back and have one next time. I ordered the rack of lamb with artichokes and told them to not to add in the olives and ham. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the taste complimented the way it looked, which was amazing.The service from the moment I walked into until the time I left was something you seldom see in Singapore. The bill wasn't over the top. I've been to 4 French restaurants in Singapore and Absinthe is one that I would put at the top of the list. If you're someone that looks for both service and food then I highly recommend giving this place a try.

Great place for a date. Super romantic french restaurant with amazing food and first class service. We rented a private room for a birthday party and got an amazing place with a big balcony overlooking the river. It comes with a bar and a seperate wash and powderroom area. Food was fantastic and they even designed a great birthday menu for us. All in all a super place. Enjoy
4
We booked a table for two and were about 15 minutes late due to problem getting a carpark lot. When we arrived we were disappointed that the restaurant was full and there were no seats for us even though we made a reservation. The manager was nice to offer us complimentary wine in return. After about 20 minutes we were shown to our table. Service was slow even though the crowd had started to leave at 2pm.Food was great value for money. Especially delicious was the foie gras. Will be back again for the lunch sets
5
our dinner last night was wonderful the outdoor its amazing we will be back great food and great service
4
Great food, good but very slow service. Good new location. Need to improve and replenish wine cellar.
5
was a wonderful evening the outdoor its well design and a great service will enjoy our evening and will be back

Fantastic restaurant on boat quay. My wife and me had a fantastic meal, washed down by an exquisite bottle of CDP. The cote de boef (wagu) is the best we've had. Excellent service and attention without being intrusive. A must do when in Singapore.
1
We were a group of 6, and ordered the Menu Absinthe. The dinner began with not enough menus for the guests, we asked for menus 3 times before they arrived, we then waited 20 minutes to order wine, another 15 minutes to order meals. We were at Absinthe mid week and the restaurant was bit not busy.The degustation menu arrived and the second course arrived before the plates from the first course had been removed. The Main course consisted of one tiny lamb rib (about 1 inch in diameter) on a desert spoon of (mash?).Wine glasses were left empty, water was not refilled and I left hungry.Not impressed.Brasserie Gavroche is a much better optio
3
Had a business dinner, we found the experience overall to be slightly disappointing. I'd been to Absinthe before, at the previous location (which i personally prefer to the current one). Food is much more casual now, flavours not as pronounced. The service was also inconsistant, again better in the old location. Value was good, with a nice winelist to match, even if it lacked variety
5
Had a business lunch for 3 people on Friday. We all ordered from the very reasonably priced lunch set-menu which was less than $40 per head for 3 courses. There was a choice of 5 dishes for each course.The food was excellent and truly authentic to a St Germain bistro, from the bread and ham pre appetizers through to the stunning cheese board. I had the steak and my co-diners had the fish and all dishes were very well received.I never went to the old location but loved the new one where they have managed to create a truly Parisian vibe...on Boat Quay!The service was knowledgeable and faultless (as I have said in other reviews this is not always "a given" in Singapore) with that touch of faux snootiness (in a good way) that is just so French!I will definitely be back for social and business meals in the future.Thanks Absinthe for a great experience

My partner & I visited Absinthe for dinner on a Friday evening. I arrived before him but was show to our table & offered a drink whilst I waited. I asked for a bottle of water for the table which only arrived after a different waiter asked me again. No great issue with this, I wasn't in a hurry. I was brought bread & butter to graze on whilst I waited for my other half. The bread was lovely, a selection of soft white, multigrain & French crusty baguette. This appeared to be limitless throughout the meal which was nice. One my partner arrived we were brought menus but had to ask for the wine list. Again, no great hardship & they had a fine & extensive collection. We both had the bouillabaisse which wasn't quite what we expected although it was delicious. Rather than it being in a pot with garlic, cheese, mustard & croutons on the side it was individually portioned with a little plate offers small flat toasted bread(2 pieces each) & a mustard cheese & garlic pre mixed spread. A little disappointing but quite a clever idea as it took up much less space & was easier to eat. The bouillabaisse itself was lovely with fresh fish & seafood & a full flavoured broth. The other food going past all looked wonderful too. My dessert was a chocolate fondant with berry sorbet which was really tasty. My only issue would be the fondant wasn't very runny in the middle. It went beautifully with the sorbet though & I really enjoyed it. The service was attentive & friendly but professional and the atmosphere was really relaxed & warm. The dining room was very stylish & reflected the French theme. There was also the offer of a glass of absinthe to finish off the meal! We declined but had a very good quality pastis instead. We were thanked & wished a good evening by the staff we passed & felt like valued guests. I would definitely go back here again. It wasn't cheap but I don't feel it was overpriced all things considered.

Maybe our expectations were too high but we didn't really like it. We were planning to visit Absinthe quite for a while, we stepped down from Oso one day and had an introduction tour at their French venue. And we believed it had to be quite special. BUT IT WASN’T. Maybe because of the changing the location… Boat quay has a special spirit and an empty neighbors trying to attract and invite the passers do not add any chic to the place.The food was quite ok but nothing special either. It was a family dinner so my husband and my elder son had a tasting menu… they were not impress at all! Both my mom and I had a lobster bisque which was ok.The winner on that night was the lamb for my youngest son! He enjoyed his rack of lamb and could finish it up till the very end.Overall impression is quite strange: the outdoor sitting is nice but doesn’t have the feeling of high end restaurant, the service seemed to be good and professional.But do I want to come back? I’d rather say NO
3
Absinthe has moved to Boat Quay. Whilst the scenery is great, the loaction of the terrace between two loacl restaurants means you spend most of the time with peope gawping over at your food from there. Go for one of the inside tables. Food was excellent although the pigeon was a little rarer than expected. Lamb was cooked to perfection. The wine list was great but how do they expect to make money if they don't bring the wine by the time the starter arrives? The waiter was very slow and unresponsive
5
we came last wednesday great food service and all at good price. perfect service all in good time we will be back for sure
3
You can find all the beautiful people hanging out there. Seems a new place to be. We found the food to be okay and the ambiance of the restaurant quite harsh. Won't go back.
4
Absinthe's move to Boat Quay has proven an inspired choice with the spectacular new layout of the restaurant. The food is still excellent all the wine list appears to have gotten a little spartan for some peculiar reason. Definitely worth a visit though.
4
Lucky find as we strolled along Boat Quay. Good food and great service. A nice break from the constant barrage of hosts and hostesses inviting you to the restaurants along Boat Quay. We has the fixed menu with several courses for SGD $88. Reasonable value and left feeling good, and not overstuffed. Will try again since we didn't even get to try the absinthe
4
Our first time, so we can't compare to the old location. Got a call on the day of dinner to reconfirm the time of our booking. Then received sms to advice where to park. When we arrived, we were greeted by smiling and friendly staff. Taken to 2nd floor dining area which at 7 pm was still empty. It was nice because our server could pay us full attention. We decided on the Absinthe menu. The carpaccio and lobster bisque was definitely the highlights. I loved the foie gras but hubby thought they were a tad too caramelised. Our mistake to order both pork dish for the mains as it was a bit overcooked and dry. We opted for one serving of cheese platter which the server will choose based on what he/she thinks you will prefer. We got Epoisses, Camembert and Blue Cheese, served with wafer and grapes. Coffee is included which came after our desserts of poached peaches.There was one particular big group of 6 who were a bit louder and showing off that they were big spenders. Thankfully they came about 45 minutes into our dinner. The chef came out to talk to them only. Overall, was a good experience, I will go there again
2
I would have given Absinthe in the old location a much better review. The duck terrine was bland to Terrine of What, point. My Barramundi fillet arrived only to be whisked away because (assumption) my lunch companion"s steak wasn't ready. With my rose colored glasses firmly on I hoped that meant it would be moist and Barramundi perfection when it's successor made an appearance. It was none of the above, overcooked and dry without any redeeming sauce which would have been welcome relief. The chocolate tarts for dessert had an astonishing transformation en route from the kitchen, arriving as peach tarts. The service was friendly and pleasant and the correct tarts were delivered. Pretty bathroom but not enough to make us go back
5
Discovered Absinthe about 3 years ago...we go there when we need a (guaranteed!) great meal & foie gras done properly. Their new digs on Boat Quay is nice & relatively easy to find (nearer to the North Bridge Rd side). We both had the Menu Absinthe and almost every dish was divine...I especially liked the scallop carpaccio & lobster bisque. Portions are just right...actually felt a little full after the 3 entrees :SService at Absinthe is always good and it was no different this time. It was my birthday (they had actually asked my husband whilst he was making the reservation) & although he mentioned to them that there was no need for anything to be done (I hate attention!) they brought out a complimentary pair of desserts complete with candle & chocolate birthday msg at the end of our meal. Sweet eh? Literally & figuratively.We'll be back in a couple of months, for sure
5
Went here as a couple in late July. We wanted to try a bit of every so went for the menu absinthe at $88 which in my opinion was great value with all courses being deliscious. Had a bottle of house white with the total bill coming in at just under $300sgd. Service was great from the time we were greatest at the door. The only negative is that it can get quite noisy if a few larger tables are dining. Hence the 4/5 for atmosphere.
4
Great place for a business lunch within spitting distance of the CBD. Fixed price lunch menu is good value, I had the baby octopus salad to start with followed by steak frites which was perfectly cooked (both the steak and the frites), then chocolate cake to finish which was very nice. Service is friendly and efficient. I will be back

OVERVIEWEasily one the best restaurants in Singapore (#7 according to Tripadvisor as of July 2012), and quite possibly among my top 10 best (i.e most enjoyable) fine dining in the world. Mind you that this is not a Michelin star molecular gastronomy dinner extravaganza, this is a semi formal (everything in Singapore is pretty much semi formal) French cuisine done extremely well, with just the right amount of creativity. To save you time, you can stop reading now and just order the Cote de Boeuf.FOOD, SERVICE, and ATMOSPHERERecently relocated to the Boat Quay area, it retained the pleasantly frenchy, slightly rustic feel of the original place. It has multiple floors acting as various bars, lounge, and main dining areas. All the staff is very friendly, the maitre'd and sommelier have charming French accents and just the right amount of snootiness to give this restaurant an authentic fancy French restaurant :) Don't worry they are all very polite and pleasant.. Francois the chef is also very approachable, and will cater to your requests. If you like things to be more fancy and less traditional, his off the menu creations are also very interesting and memorable.I've been here several times and I always start with the Lobster Bisque (very traditional, but very well executed with a beautiful texture and well balanced flavors; they don't cheat by simply putting in lobster chunks to make you happy). The seared scallops, shrimp cooked under the salamander (the cooking equipment, not the crispy lizard eaten whole in Japan), and the thinly sliced Iberico ham (yes this one is not French) are appetizers worth mentioning. For main, we've tried the lamb chops, Iberico / Kurobuta pork chops, pastas, and fish dishes, and I can tell you that they are all excellent. The highlight of the show however, is the Cote de Boeuf (minimum order for two persons). Think a large sized bone in rib eye, served medium rare in think slices (yes like Bistecca ala Florentina, but replace the black pepper and lemon wedge with au jus). Here they do use Wagyu ribs so the meat is especially tender with the perfect amount of marbled fat (no disgusting big chunks of loose fat here). Apparently Francois just found a new beef supplier and I can tell you that my steak last weekend was even better than ever before, quite unbelievable. The texture of the each bite (the outside crust, the cooked underlayer, and then the pink juicy center) is divine. The smoky fragrance of the crust, and taste of the beef, and the slight undertones of herbs and spices is extremely well balanced. My mouth is salivating again now just writing about it, good thing I'm going back to Singapore in a couple of weeks :) They also have excellent hot English mustard (I like it better than their French mustard), and good Bernaise sauce. The potato au gratin side is both light and creamy.Dessert has not always been their strong point (except for their super fluffy Souffle that recenty got removed from the menu), but after my visit a couple of days ago I now change my mind. We had their lemon tart and white chocolate lemon cake (again, nothing fancy here, just very well done). I can confidently say that everything in Absinthe from start to finish is excellent. From the butter, to the cheese tray, all of them. I've never had a dish here that was just "blah". Simple as that.Oh, of course don't forget to order a shot of Absinthe at the end. If I am not mistaken, Absinthe (the alcoholic drink) is still not legally sold in the US. They have an extensive selection and any two of them will knock you out, so I suggest you order as an after dinner drink, not as pre dinner cocktails. PRICEAbsinthe is not cheap, but by far it is not the most expensive in Singapore either. The really expensive ones are either located in the Marina Bay Sands Casino complex or serve sushi. If I am not mistaken it is approximately 30% cheaper than Joel Robuchon or CUT by Wolfgang Puck. We had a 3 course dinner for 5 adults and a young child (the chef very kindly made him fish and chips) and a good bottle of Burgundy chosen by the sommelier, and the bill ended up at approximately SGD 900. So roughly USD 150 per person including wine.COMPARISONS and OTHER RAMBLINGSThere are no test tube glasses, dry ice gasses, and funky white foams on every dish here (i.e. Vue de Monde in Melbourne). No super stuffy formal atmosphere (i.e. Taillevent in Paris, where they actually removed my navy sports jacket and made me wear their rental black jacket, but thank goodness i was allowed to wear my own tie at least - its even more offensive that I actually called in advance to verify that ties and jackets are NOT stictly required; and no, the food turned out to be not worth the hassle and insult :) ). There's also no funky meats here either (freshly hunted wild venison sashimi anyone? Try one at the Inverlochy Castle in Scotland for a horrible gamey after taste that will linger in your mouth for the rest of the weekend). Seats are also not that difficult to get here in Absinthe (i.e. it took me 3 separate trips to finally get a reservation at Gordon Ramsey in London). Enjoyment level? It's defintely on par with the best of Joel Robuchon's restaurants worldwide (yes, the Joel Robuchon in Singapore's very good too, with possibly the best bread basket and home made butter).But I digress, my point is that I've been to quite a few top restaurants in Singapore (Le Petit Salut, Gunther's, Les Ami, etc) and although all of them have their merits, none is more enjoyable for repeat visits than Absinthe. The cooking here is admitedly not the most technically advanced, the menu creation not the most creative, but the consistency of excellence in every dish is simply stunning. Plus the Cote de Boeuf will make you drool in your sleep

What a great evening!!! when we came last friday at Absinthe everything was perfect.
the warm welcome from the maitre d' , the warm and great service to the quality of the food
Thanks for a perfect evening

Great food, great service,great atmosphere. We would go back again and again.

Food was pleasant though missing wow factor. Service staff was good,

we had dinner at absinthe last night, it was beautifull great welcome the restaurant manager vincent came to our table to be sure everything was perfect the service was perfect its what we like when we go to a french restaurant.!!!!!!!!

We had lunch at their old location as of this week they are moving to Boat Quay, perfect if you like French food, Francois is a great chef, and the service is excellent, formal but not stiff, excellent value lunch menus!
2
Went with partner for lunch. Intentionally skipped the set and asked for recommendation. Food turned out to be nice but normal - I can't recall what I ate... But sure remembered we paid close to $300 without any wine nor alcoholic drinks.Atmosphere was good, staff very attentive but noticed special attention was geared towards certain guests. Don't think I'll go back
5
Enjoyed a fabulous night with another couple on a weekend trip from Perth, Australia. Even though it was a full house the staff were extremely attentive! The food was exquisite and beautifully presented. We were also pleasantly surprised the menu was more than affordable which also had a degustation option! We sat outside underneath an elegant marquis looking onto Clark Quay/Singapore River and enjoyed the cool tropical breeze of Singapore that one looks forward to. We have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this amazing restaurant to our friends. You have to do yourself a favour and make a reservation (if you don't want to be disappointed) as you wouldn't want to miss out! We have dined at Michelin star restaurants and enjoy a variety of cuisines and we must say this is definitely 2 thumbs up!

Smart and sophisticated restaurant on Boat Quay ! Am told more on their way. Found the food tasty, quite elegant - trendy modern, service at the moment it trying too hard to please, lots of staff doing something and nothing. Had to ask for wine list three times (Rate their House Sancere but not their Syrah) waited 10 mins to get a waiter for a coffee. In general I think groups spending a fair amount on Wine.... are of more intrerest than singletons - hope fully that will change. Would if I could definitely try out their $35 3 course lunch. French Chef been in Singapore for 16 years and his staff know their stuff - sure after a few weeks in their new home it will all be good

Went to Absinthe two days before it moved to Boat Quay for dinner with a close friend. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet even for a Thursday evening, and the welcome was warm and attentive. Service was great for the first half of the meal but then the waiting staff disappeared and were hard to find for the second half of the evening. Its fair to say that the food, from the set Menu Absinthe, lacked the wow factor I was expecting. The carpaccio of scallop was ok and presented ok, bur at the end of the day, it is raw scallop! The lobster bisque was good but not great. The foie gras was excellent but tasted very similar to that served by the neighboring Oso last time I was there! The codfish main eaten by my friend was again competent and the risotto which accompanied it was the highlight. Odd for a French restaurant!The big downer was the lamb main I ordered. It was recommended by the waitress, but was one of the biggest disappointments of any restaurant I have eaten in. It was like eating tasteless leather, more like mutton than lamb. At $39++ on the a la carte menu, this was really really bad, and I think I would have sent it back if I had been able to attract the staff's attention at that point. Any requested changes to the set menu attracted a supplement, and the desserts we ordered, chocolate fondant and souffle Grand Marnier were again competent but unexciting - where was the Grand Marnier?- the ice creams which accompanied these were good. We had to try the absinthe, which was an experience in itself beyond the taste! A drinkable bottle of white wine to accompany, and there goes $400. The french reds on the menu were blisteringly expensive, but that's Singapore for you. Just about the most expensive meal for two I have ever eaten - and I have eaten in several Michelin starred restaurants in UK and Europe.So lots of room for improvement

We were a party of six and enjoyed a wonderful dinner here. The restaurant is tucked away in an interesting and exotic area (red light) of Singapore. It will be moving to a more salubrious location shortly – I hope this will not spoil the exotic and somewhat mysterious effect of arriving at Absinthe. The food was faultless – Foie Gras Poêlé - Pan Fried Foie Gras, Morello Cherries and Blinis; Turbot Filet “a la plancha”, Bok Choy, Portobello and Shallots, Parsley Coulis. Of course we enjoyed some excellent wine and champagne. The service was professional and friendly. A real French treat far away from France. Well worth a visi

last night we had a dinner at Absinthe restaurant, was great service friendly and the food was nice very good ambiance and like the music
5
a beautifull evening and great ambiance at Absinthe
4
The food was very good, and nice staff, i will came back
4
The food was decent, not fantastic but good enough. Expensive though for what you get. Good service, interesting and inventive food, but it didnt all go together and didnt work, but it was a good experience overall. Drinks were nice too.
5
Highly recommended. Great French food and attentive, caring service.
5
He was a great evening... the food was excellent and the service very profesional I will go back soon
5
first for us at Absinthe When you look at it the entrance doesnt show a very good impression but when you go in you are warmly welcome by the restaurant manger and the staff the food is good especially the Foie Gras and the duck confi
5
This is the third time I have been here now, and it's just as great and memorable each time. I was here on my last night in Singapore with a few mates, and it did not disappoint. We left completely satisfied, enjoyed some great wines, and once again experienced excellent service. This place has come to be somewhat of a regular every time I'm in Singapore- and I hope to check out their new place when they move. I will definitely be back again
5
My (now) wife and I went to Absinthe the night after getting engaged last year and returned recently on our honeymoon. From the service to the food and wine, it was the best dining experience that we ever had. Our return trip didn't disappoint either. You can't go wrong with the menu, but try the lobster bisque and the Ibirico Ham before any of their legendary meat dishes. Save room also for the indulgent cheese tray
2
Unfortunately, Absinthe turned out to be as average as the 3 people I polled before going said it would be. Having read mixed reviews and noting that it was moving to a new venue I assumed that it must be OK. In short - it was a poor choice to go with friends who appreciate good food and was in the whole, a pretty unmemorable experience. On arrival, it took 10 minutes to be asked if we wanted a drink. The vodka-martini was bland and had too much water in it. The rest of the group had champagne before we started on the wine list. I can't recall what I had as an entree - I think it was smoked eel... pretty bland. friends had soup and foie gras which was OK. My main was belly pork which was well cooked and full of flavour. The lamb was also pretty good. We had two bottles of french wine with dinner - around about $160 a bottle. Like the food, it was OK but only memorable for the somewhat inept service - our conversation was repeatedly interrupted by the waiter. Atmosphere/ambience was lacking - a comment made to me by others who have visited this restaurant. Would I go back ? - probably not. Osso, Gunther's, Valentino's all offer a better experience for both food and atmosphere at a higher cost for the food but a similar mark up on the wine. Would I recommend it? - No, sorr
5
Lived here for a few years. Tried most good places. This is the best. The actual food was perfectly cooked and quality was the best.
Go there.
5
If you don't want to go to Paris for lunch, then you should go here.
4
New restaurant, excellent menu, light, refined and delicious! It lacked a bit of atmosphere over lunch and the service while good was not at par with the food
5
Excellent food. We live in Singapore and tried this restaurant during the restaurant week. Everything was top notch. The highlight of the set dinner was a crab salad. Don't miss!
5
Very good food, tucked away on a side street in Chinatown. Have a shot of absinthe after dinner. Very cool small restaurant.
4
Like many others, my wife and I had difficulty finding Absinthe because we did not realize that the Outram Park MRT station is a sprawling grotto with many exits, not a single point as shown on the map in the website. We are grateful that Absinthe will move to a new location at Boat Quay at the end of April because it should be quite easy to find. We were shown to a table for two near the back, next to the wine cellar and next to a large table for 10 people. Service was polite, helpful, and attentive. The candlelight atmosphere was pleasant and romantic until the table for 10 started filling up. We ordered cream of mushroom soup. When we asked why it was so delicious, I think the waiter said they put truffle oil in it. We shared an order of Kurobota pork belly with potatoes. It was also delicious and very well prepared, but we would have enjoyed it with more potatoes. We are partial to sweet wines, and they provided a Domaine de Souche Juracon sweet wine by the glass that had a very fruity taste without being too sweet. We would go back just for another glass of that delightful wine. The waiter explained that Domaine de Souche is in the southwestern part of France neat the Spanish border. We had lavender crÃ¨me brulee with peach sorbet for dessert. It was good but we ate it hurriedly and paid the bill at the front as the birthday party heated up. We look forward to trying a more private couples table and the veal filet if it is on the menu at the new location
5
visited this great restaurant with friend mid of March I had to come back with my wife - and here we go - same great service, food, wine.I am happy to give 5 points to a place which really is a high quality place - especially in all three points I mentioned - service (friendly and promt), food (fantastic) and wine (yes wine is expensive in Singapore - but here you get best value for your pocket).Happy as soon as possible
2
I have been in Absynthe number of times, and use to spend significant amount on wines and others.Waiters have changed and keeps pooring water in your glass, and ask you for what you wish to drink before you are even seated. I don't find the service elegant at all quite the opposite . If we are coming there we will spend money anyway so why adding unecessary and unpleasant manner to it, I am not qutie sure. Food is still great though, and quality can't be discussed for this side. But you have quite a few restarant around with similar qualitites now, Angelus, Les Amis are some of them and I don't think I will go again very soon
5
We had the five-course set dinner and it was wonderful! The dishes were interesting and unusual combinations of ingredients and every course was delicious. The wine list was comprehensive, but very pricey. (We eased the pain by having wine by the glass -- not cheap but allowed a bit of cost control.
5
Amazing, Fantastic, Unbelievable, Out of this World, Sublime. There are no words that can do this truly amazing restaurant justice.My husband and I have been here 4 or 5 times now and it is without question our favorite and the best restaurant in Singapore.Every time we enter this restaurant we are greeted like family. The staff cannot do enough to help. The wine selection is amazing and good advice is readily available, by now they know what we like and recommendations never disappoint.The food is equally amazing we have tried several dishes and they have all been exceptional I am sure everything on the menu is great
4
Great food service and wine list Good for romanatic dinner or a business meeting
3
Went for business lunch. Food was ok. Nothing amazing.
5
We ate at Absinthe with friends who reported it on a previous trip to Singapore as being a delightful surprise. Tucked away in Chinatown it is a quiet retreat from the outside bustle ( especially 2 days before Chinese New Year. Service was friendly, attentive and discrete, and the food was suburb. Best of all was experiencing the preparation and taste of absinthe itself: definitely a memorable experience
5
On our last night in Singapore we wanted something special and decided to visit "Absinthe".The place is a bit difficult to find as the intersection New Bridge Rd/Bukit Pasoh Rd is blocked off by a building site.We made a reservation and on arrival were greeted by a friendly waitress who escorted us to our table.Shortly after, the Maitre D' introduced himself and wished us a pleasant evening. I though this to be a very nice gesture, The wine list looks interesting, but due to medical reasons I couldn't drink alcohol tonight. So we stayed with sparkling water (Badoit).The menu is impressive. We finally ordered the 5 course menu.Everything was great, but the seared foie gras deserves special mentioning.For mains my wife had the rack of lamb, which was to die for and I had the John Dory which I enjoyed very much.The atmosphere reminds me of a modern Parisian eatery. The service is very attentive and the whole affair is unpretentious.Will I go there again? Definitely !BTW, the restaurant will move to a new location at Boat Quay in April 2012. Watch their website for details
4
Difficult to find so take a taxi. We were greeted outside the restaurant by the Manager and escorted to our table. The food was excellent with French flair. Good quality, but perhaps a little expensive. The restaurant is long and narrow lacking some character and atmosphere, but would certainly eat here again for the great food and welcome.
4
I wanted to give a special treat to thank my wife and to celebrate my son's birthday so was choosing between Absinthe and Nicolas Le Restaurant. We decided on Absinthe because it was rated #1 on Tripadvisor then. My wife and I ordered the degustation, my boy ordered the chicken and truffle special. Turns out he made the better choice, the chicken with truffle was divine (there was no kid's portion so we made it an excuse to sample his portion). The cheese with the french grapes was a perfect combination, at least for my son and I. Overall, it was a delightful experience
5
Even though I have left Singapore a year ago, I never miss a trip to Absinthe every time I'm back. My lovely boyfriend took me there in November for my birthday. Everything was absolutely perfect, from the two glasses of Champagne that welcomed us, to the impeccable professional and friendly service, the cozy atmosphere and of course, the delicious food. Vincent and Francois's warmth really made that day special.We both went for the 6-course Menu Absinthe. Every course was prepared to perfection. The pan-fried foie gras with warm blini and morello cherries particularly stood out. The fois gras's caramelised crust was deliciously crispy, contrasting with the softness of the inside. The sourness of the cherries beautifully cut through the richness of the dish - geez I am actually drooling thinking of it, as I'm typing this review! :-)We also had the cheese platter. This comes with a small supplement, but definitely worth it, especially given the wide range to choose from.My only regret - not being able to dine there more often
5
I came here with a friend for lunch. First off, it's seriously a pain to find this place- perhaps my fault for poor navigation skills, but why not somewhere more accessible? Anyways, the restaurant was quiet (cos I was so late) and there was just 1 waiter there. We ordered the set lunch and got a foie gras on top of that. Food was good. Not the best I've had, but very acceptable. Price was alright too for a lunch. 50 a person? We had a fish entree and a beef rib entree. The fish was a lot better. Clean flavors and a light broth. A nice take on what would normally be a bland soupy fish dish. The beef was well cooked. But the sauce on it was rather thick. Perhaps over reduced? Well, I'm not one to judge based on set menus, so I'll be back soon.

For a full review with photos, visit http://ms-skinnyfat.blogspot.com/2011/12/indulgent-eats-absinthe-restaurant.htmlI went for the Menu Absinthe which is a 6 course meal (if you include the coffee at the end? Is that even a course really?). This is so typical of me- Variety first. Stomach space second. Besides there's the boy to finish up my food for me :)) And the smart S anticipated that already so he only ordered an appetizer and his main. :)Bisque de HomardLobster Bisque for the boy. Creamy rich seafood with chunks of fresh chewy lobster flesh. I didn't taste much of it because he finished EVERYTHING. He didn't even offer me much. :(Carpaccio de Saint Jacques, Marinade Citron et Tuile à l'Encre de SeicheScallop Carpaccio, Squid Ink Tuile and Lemon Dressing- Sweet succulent scallop flesh. Granted it's not as good as the fresh ones at the markets in Hokkaido but it sure cuts close. The lemon dressing is refreshing with the rock salt and pepper crunch and mint leaves of sort.Gambas Flambées à l'Absinthe, Pignons de Pin et Petite Salade Sautéed King Prawns Flambéed with Absinthe, Pine Nuts and Herb Salad. The dish is quite small but just about the right portion. It's a tomato cream base that is not too heavy. Slightly bland and no hint of Absinthe at all? Prawns were fresh and crunchy like fei cui xia (if there's even such a thing).Foie Gras Poêlé, Blinis et Cerises GriottesPan Fried Foie Gras, Morello Cherries and Blinis- My favorite dish!! Foie gras with cherries is the best combination ever. I like that it is a little charred on the outside (hence the crispiness) and the interior just melts (how can it not? it's pure fats anyway!). The creamy texture is contrasted by the tangy sourish sweet cherries. And the little bliny just soaks all that juice and essence up. My mouth is watering just thinking about it... Boeuf Wagyu Grillé (8+), Millefeuille de Pomme de Terre, Petits Légumes et Jus NaturelGrilled Beef Wagyu, Potato Millefeuille, Baby Vegetables and Natural Jus. Steak has to be done medium rare to maintain the juice and the soul of the cow. I kid you but this steak is extraordinary. There is no gravy with the steak but it is moist and flavorful. Must be some secret marinate that was used or some technique that sealed the flavor in. Blew my mind. Cabillaud Rôti, Risotto au Crevettes, Emulsion de Feuille de Kaffir Roasted Black Cod, Prawn Risotto and Kaffir Lime Leaf Emulsion. I'm not a fish fan but this comes recommended by the server. It was the cod or the milk-fed veal fillet. I was leaning towards the latter but that would be quite predictable. As usual, fresh ingredients. Very light despite the cream based risotto (that was cooked perfectly). A little bland. I'm quite a savory food person. In all, a good experience though the wait between dishes could be a tad faster
5
If there was a Rick's (from Casablanca). The staff is well trained, polished, and dedicated to customer's delight.Not to mention the satiable food.Soon as I mentioned my wife is a vegetarian, the chef personally came to greet us and help us with a customized menu.The tomato tarts were the tastiest ever, and the foie GRAS - the richest in taste.Would definitely be re visiting, very soon
5
Followed a recommendation as the best french restaurant in town, and can garanty that it is!
3
Pros:- Quick, responsive service- Nice atmosphere. We were surrounded by couples but we did not feel that there was anyone else in the restaurant.- Check out their array of condiments! Their mustards are out of this world!Cons:- Foie Gras was great- Salmon was alright. The lamb was a little undercooked, but the problem was solved with their awesome selection of mustards (which is kinda not the point, I know)- Crab salad (the appetizer) was alright. Nothing to cheer about.- Profiteroles tasted like they came out of a box from the frozen section.Overall:I should caveat my review by saying that we went during Restaurant Week, so the menu was capped at S$50++ per head. In view of that, I would be foolish to expect my dinner to have been out of this world. Hence the question of whether the regular menu would present a substantial improvement in standard remains to be answered. But if this dinner was anything to go by, I would probably not return again for the regular menu unless someone's buying
5
We ate at Absinthe over the weekend, whilst visiting Singapore.If you are in Singapore, I absolutely recommend that you dine here.We chose the menu Absinthe which was absolutely delicious, perfectly executed and really hard to fault. We paired the menu with some excellent and well priced French wine that was thoughtfully chosed by a very knowledgable waiter/sommelier.I can't wait to dine at Absinthe again on my next visit to Singapore
4
Service was impeccable, food was delectable! I had a pumpkin soup followed by a grilled tuna dish ( I hope it was sustainable tuna). There is a huge construction project going on just steps away from the restaurant and I have heard they are relocating which is a good thing. Not that it disturbed me whilst I was in the restaurant but when you arrive, and lets say you are looking to impress, perhaps not the best first impression.Go to Absinthe, enjoy the food and perhaps the best service I have received in Singapore. Great value for money
3
What disappointed us the most was the service. Having heard of the recognition the chef had enjoyed for creating the palates pleasers over the years,we each ordered a full dinner with individual starter,main and dessert. We even had entrees to share and the menu had more hits than misses. Great things are going on in the kitchen,though a tad too untidy. We could see it through a glass panel by our table but that's forgiven as the chef walked to the table to check on the experience. That was just before the main courses arrived. Shortly after,unhealthy things started presenting themselves. Service was run by a team of 4 staff. A manager wearing a sharp suit,during a not-busy dinner service making no attempts to engage with us but instead walking around aimlessly. A lady server who is earnest but not well versed on the menu at all,in fact she is terribly new. A french wine sommelier whom slouches and appeared young and unsure with the wines on their menu so bad that we had to order a red that we are all more familiar with. And an unkempt server asst whom we can't get attention from when we needed more bread or water. We were the last table and the last thing we needed was the kitchen staff walking past the table one by one with half uniforms entering the toilet. They stared and even looked unfriendly,as if we were culprits to end their shift late. Felt like there was no passion on the job. No one offered to call is a taxi after presenting the bill of over SGD1K for 7 persons. Recommended to go only if you are there for its food. Horrible service
3
Food (esp wagyu beef) was decent but the restaurant does not deserve being in the top 5. Ambience was poor (noisy and cramped) and service was average at best. The degustation menu is quite good value for money, but alacarte dishes were hit and miss. Overall I would say not quite there
5
I took the wife last Saturday night. We had the "Absinth Menu" and it was excelent, all of it. We had the cheese course as well and the selection was very good. The atmophere was interesting, small and cozy yet relaxed if a bit noisy (that might have mainly been due that night to the 20+ table that took up half the main rom) while the food is top notch and the service has to be some of the most attentive yet unobtrusive I have had. Beyond the wait staff the head Chef also stopped by to get our input on the meal. We will go back
4
We visited the Absinthe for the second time this month. We have awaited a long time (more than a year) since our last visit, as although the food had seemed very good to us, the place was too noisy for our taste.So finally we went last week just the 3 of us, and yes indeed the place is still too noisy, remembering of a french brasserie; however:- the service is friendly AND efficient, which is not a given in Singapore- far for the overpriced trendy outlets in Singapore, the degustation menu at about 100 SGD in excellent value for money,- the food is just great : not the classical french stuff foreigners like (I am french) but kind of innovative version of our cusine; big classics like the duck config but the lemongrass flavored sauce of the scallops give a very interesting asian twist.- nice choice of wine at reasonable price, finally you can have something else than a Chablis in white burgundies!- finally the chef is very friendly and often present in the room and eager to chat about the food or just about anything else.A great experience, we'll go back soon
5
What prompted me to actually try this quaint and cozy french restaurant is the ranking here at trip advisor. Was quite intrigued so I tried. The facade and interiors of the restaurant is pretty good. Very cozy and relaxed. I chose their set menu which costs 98SGD (excluding taxes and SC). The presentation and taste is very good but what really made me happy's their service. The staff is very accommodating and helpful. Throughout the course of my dinner, I observed how warm and pleasant their staff is. Can't wait to go back for my 2nd experience at absinthe
5
I visited this restaurant again last month for dinner with some friends, and it was excellent.I've read the recent negative reviews, and of course, I'm disappointed to read about negative experiences.On the evening of my visit, we were greeted by Mr Francois Mermilliod- the Executive Chef- who visited our table during the evening. He seemed to be genuinely interested in our enjoyment.We had the degustation menu, which was excellent, and good value for the exceptional quality offered.The service was attentive, professional and friendly.The wine list was excellent.The decor and ambience is definitely French.On the whole, we had a memorable evening.Based on my visits to the restaurant, as well as others by friends, I can highly recommend this restaurant for consistent excellence
2
What an unbelievable disappointment! More negative reviews are bound to follow for this completed overrated eatery. Zero ambiance, hopeless service and subpar food.
If you want the perfect French restaurant in Singapore you must try L'Angelus on Club St.
5
Tucked in a quiet corner near Chinatown (Bukit Pasoh) area, Absinthe offers top notch French food and a great wine list. Very friendly service staff helped complete the excellent experience.
2
Given its good reviews, was very disappointed. Beef taste was off. Food was inconsistently seasoned. My wife had the oysters and became very ill a few hours later. Will never go back.
5
We went there on a Saturday night with last minute reservation. Luckilly the staff was very helpful and managed to fit us in last minute on 7pm dinner reservation. We were treated with fantastic first class service. We ordered a half bottle of borgogne 2005 1er cru white but it didn't taste alright. The staff didn't argue somemore but serving us another bottle of recommended wine straightaway.Dinner was perfect. We gave everything 10/10 except the French wine we had that night. Lol.( Maybe we are just not used to French wine) Definitely will go back and recommend to others. P/s : pls dont judge the restaurant from outside. It might not looking grand from the outside but it is #1 on tripAdvisor for a reason.
5
Ok so I love Singapore but the best bit about this place was that it was totally not like being in Singapore at all. Very authentic- I felt like I was in Europe. Food was good, prices were reasonable, excellent wine, service was attentive, atnosphere was intimate. We will be back
5
Went here for dinner when I was in Singapore. From the moment I booked until the time I left, I felt welcome and received excellent service.The staff were friendly and helpful, running me through their Absinthe selections, while also very attentive throughout the evening without being overbearing. Food was great and the wine list extensive. They even put us in a more quiet area of the restaurant as there was a big noisy table in the main dining room- very thoughtful.I will definitely be back next time I am in Singapore
1
Very disappointing considering how many good things I had heard and was expecting from this restaurant. Our party of 10 ordered at the same time, the appetisers arrived for all of us at the same time, but then there was a long, long delay waiting for the main courses to arrive. Half of our party received our main courses and then we others were still waiting half an hour later, whilst our friends had already finished. When we complained, the chef himself came out, heard what we had to say and instead of apologising, he simply pointed at the empty plates of those who had already eaten and suggested that we should have shared some of theirs while we were waiting. Charming. Apparently that is official restaurant policy, if your food doesn't arrive, just share your neighbours. The next morning I had terrible food poisoning just to really top off the whole experience. And no it was not attributable to anything else I ate that da
5
I have tried a number of the high end restaurants in Singapore for birthdays & special occasions and Absinthe was the first one that has delivered value for the price. There are many restaurants in Singapore who charge "fine dining" prices and deliver mediocre food & service, however at Absinthe the food & service is excellent. I would recommend for a special occasion
5
Went here with a group of 6 and we were very well looked after. Waiters were well trained which is unusual for Singapore and it's nice to not have to chase a waiter to take your order or ask for a drink. Most of went for the degustation menu which consists of 3 starters, main, optional cheese (+$14), dessert and tea/coffee all for $98 a head. This was excellent value for money and we spent 3 hours happilyeating our way through the whole thing. Best bit was that when finished we were not overfull and had had exactly the right amount to eat of so many different tastes. My personal favourite was the foie gras with cherries. Overall an excellent place to take partners or for business. Highly recommended
5
I visited Absinthe while on business in Singapore where I took some colleagues and visitors for a business dinner. I can say that I couldn't have chosen a better place to leave a great impression.The restaurant is located in a really pleasant neighborhood in Singapore, it can be accessed by all taxis and public transportation. It is located in a a very traditional Asian neighborhood making the experience very "localized" knowing that you are actually going to a french restaurant.The service was outstanding, greeted at the door by charming butlers and chefs de rang, offered the menus just on time and explained everything which we asked for. The impressive thing is that for the first time I enter a French restaurant, i actually understand the ingredients included in the meals. Usually they give you a list of all the constituents, but you just don't understand anything, not in Absithe where you actually know what you are eating.The personal are extremely courteous and very experienced in taking care of you. You don't feel that you are dealing with just service providers but with actual experts in what they do. The food is just out of this world, the meat is better than most of the places I went into and serving the same kind of menu in different part of the world. The restaurant also has a list of great wines from major producers around the world. Make sure you order a bottle or two and just enjoy it with a thick steak prepared the french way.I highly suggest this plac

Deservedly well praised. A decent restaurant with nice setting and fair pricing. Advise you book in advance

Superb cuisine and great value. A good wine list and a cheese trolley that is the envy of the town.

I choose this Absinthe to spoil my French husband to have dinner on the last day of our honeymoon. It turns out to be a very big mistake. I reserve this French restaurant because of the review of Tripadvisor. The food is fine. It is not romatic at all because a couple sitting behins us brought a crying baby with them. The waitress was dishonest and rude. After we order the Absinthe menu 98$++each, which included three starters, one main course, French cheese, dessert and tea. The waitress came to tell us there are some hams tonight and would we like to share with each other? We said we would like to share, of course. She charges 50$++ to our bill for the 50g ham directly. We didn't know the price and didn't know we have to pay for it until we see the bill. When I ask her for a pen to sign my bill she refused. She said she has to check if I could pay with this credit card first. To my point of view, the waitress is dishonest and rude

I took clients here based solely on the TripAdvisor review. Dinner was absolutely superb. The service was fantastic and the food was absolutely delightful. The waiter brought an amuse-bouche for the one member of our party who didn't order an appetizer - not only very thoughtful but she said it was very tasty. Among the five of us, we had steak, lamb, fish, and seafood. Everyone was extremely pleased with their dinners. The desserts were heavenly and the cheese trolley was to die for. Service was wonderful throughout. I was so thrilled to have had such a wonderful dinner experience based solely on a TripAdvisor review . Definitely recommend making reservations

Our concierge almost talked me out of experiencing 'Absinthe' but I'm so glad we chose to ignore his advice. From arriving to leaving the restaurant we felt so welcome and pleased with the professional service. I could perhaps fault it on one very minor point but it was quickly picked up and rectified so quickly that it doesn't rate mentioning. If you love French Food and excellent service and your fortunate enough to be in Singapore you owe it to yourself to book in at Absinthe. Took my Mum along who was somewhat so-so about going but she came away raving about the Duck she ordered and the attentive service. Well done everyone for a great evening

Aftere the closing of my former favorite restaurant (the Braize at Sentosa) I was looking for a while for any equivalent in terms of quality of food and service. And found the Absinthe to be even better (except for the atmosphere; the Braize was right at the beach). We've come here for the 5th time now and have never had the slightest thing to critize about it. So I finally got myself to write a well deserved review. The maitre de service is amazing, and so is the chef who continously ensures that everybody is happy and satisfied by personally taking care of his guests. The food is just impecable. If you like french food, this is the place to go to. Sure, it's expensive, but it's worth every cent. The fois gras (29) and the wagyu (70pp) are not only cooked to perfection, you also get a generous portion (we're big eaters but have actually never been able to finish all of the wagyu; you get like a whole side for two!). And the wine selection offers very decent wines, some at very reasonable prices. We'll certainly go back at the next best occasion

Went on a Friday, place was full so call in advance (we called 5 days before). We were very happy with everything - the staff was well trained and attentive, including chef and manager. Food was good and great French wine. Ask for 'The best rum in the world' after dinner - it's amazing. Ps. bring a cardiga

Dinner at Absinthe was a very pleasant surprise. Recently, we have read positive review for other restaurants in Singapore and have been sadly disappointed. However, the good reviews for Absinthe, located in a charming part of Singapore, are all accurate. The service was professional and attentive. The food was delicious and well presented. And we appreciated the quiet atmosphere and our intimate table. The prices were very fair, and we all enjoyed what we ordered. We will definitely return and recommend to our friends

After reading the favorable reviews on TripAdvisor, I wanted to try the restaurant myself and had lunch, ordering from the two-course set menu for the day. Foie gros (available for an extra charge) was a small but perfectly prepared, a melt-in-your-mouth delicacy set in a delicate, slightly fruity sauce. The main course of fish in a safron flavored sauce was equally delectable. Dessert was less memorable but also tasty. In all, this was among the best French food I have enjoyed in a long time, at a price far more reasonable than one could find today in Paris or New York for comparable food. On leaving I learned that the restaurant was offering a promotion for those using the American Express card. Future diners may want to inquire if similar promotions are available when they visit. In addition, the restaurant is accessible from the MRT. Be sure to take exit H from the Outram Park station, which requires going to the lower level if one arrives on the East-West, rather than the Northeast, line

This is an excellent French restaurant, offering superb food, professional and attentive service, and a relaxed ambience.
The lunch special is fantastic value: three courses of sensational food for SGD38.
Highly recommended

Fantastic from beginning to end. The food, the service, the atmosphere, and of course the absinthe:) Perfect evening for us.

Phillipe and his crew provide an wonderful culinary experience here in Singapore. Outstanding service; great advice on wine selection aginst an excellent wine list. Check it out.

We held a dinner for 10 people in the private Billecart Salmon room about 3 weeks ago. 8 of us come from Perth Australia for the weekend for a special bday event. The restaurant designed a special menu for us and made a huge effort to make sure the night was a success. The food was incredible (the restauranted is widely regarded as one of the top 3 in SIngapore) and we were not disappointed. The service was attentive but not intrusive. There is a really funky bar downstairs and the place has a very cool atmosphere. The Absinthe explanation and pouring at the end of the dinner is an absolute must - even if you think the stuff tastes ghastly....Would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone and I will be going back many times when in Singapore

Whilst visiting Singapore, I took my wife to Absinthe to celebrate our wedding anniversary. As soon as we arrived, I knew that I had made a good choice. The staff were professional, yet very friendly and genuine.We ordered entree, main, dessert and drinks and we could not fault anything about the meal. We were offered bread throughout the night, until dessert arrived, and we were also surprised with an extra dessert to share on a platter that wished us a very happy anniversary, which was a fantastic touch.There were a lot of business meetings, one right next to us in the private cellar, which we found a little noisy (but a little interesting too) until the door was closed and we couldn't hear another word. Considering how busy it was, we were never abandoned, nor were we ever rushed or pressured into ordering something else or finish our meals. I even noticed that Chef Francois walking around greeting patrons, which I thought was lovely, although I would have been uncomfortable if he came to our table. But Philippe did a few times and made us feel very much like a welcomed guest. At one stage he saw my wife and I sharing food (as you do), so he rushed over and gave us clean cutlery to do so.When we left, all the staff thanked us and even asked us if we needed a taxi called. Because it was raining, they seemed concerned for us that we didn't want one and even offered to escort us with an umbrella to the nearby MRT, which we graciously declined.My wife and I found the whole experience at Absinthe wonderful and made our anniversary one to remember. And because it turned out to be a fantastic night, I scored big brownie points with the wife

I went to Absinthe after reading the reviews on this site so had quite high expectations. I wasn't disappointed ... I was delighted with the meal, the service and the atmosphere. It's just a small restaurant, tucked away but everything was fantastic!I had the degaustation menu and each dish was a beautiful surprise: both presentation and taste!Definitely recommend you go here if you are looking for a beautiful, intimate evening
5
We booked for Valentines day & arrived to a full house - always a good sign.The place has a nice feel small, intimate & lovely surroundings. Upon arrival we were a little taken aback that the evening would be a set menu - not all that surprising given the occasion so we went with the flow. Food was good the wine list extensive and the service very professional.They capped the night with a special touch by giving a lovely red rose to all the ladies - nice touch.The area around the hotel is interesting and I suspect is quite the scene on weekends.Would happily recommend and return when in town

Ignore the ignorant naysayers" would be what any proper foodie would say. Francois, Philippe and crew turn out a good show unfailingly. The food is delicious (consistently and creatively), the wine is fine (did you see the list?), the service is conscientious (in Singapore! - ahem need I say more?), the ambience is convivial (perfect be it business, date or blogging - seriously it ALL works!) - many are fans.. To show off, we had tonight: a fresh moist trout tartare, uni sitting on a plump Hokkaido scallop amidst fragrant greens, foie gras on a delicate blini with morello cherries, the best bouillabaisse in Singapore (so say the French, what do I know), crisp smokey kurobota belly, and grade 8 marbled wagyu - I'm in heaven.. Admittedly a glut's heaven - but it's a special night :-) and the guys have done it yet again.

I have been to Absinthe on many occasions over the past 2 years. Cosy ambience and impeccable service and not forgetting the great food. The food and service are consistent and never once failed us. The price is reasonable for the type of french food they offer. Good selection of wine too at reasonable price. Chef Francois is simply gifted in his culinary skill!!

Excellent French Food.
Very nice service.
Great atmosphere.

After reading all these great reviews about absinthe i was excited about visiting for a gf's birthday dinner.. Ambience was lovely, my foie gras starter was good... i was almost impressed with this restaurant till i got my 1st filet mignon which turned out well done. I might not be a great cook myself but to get a steak from medium rare to well done takes more than just a couple of minutes mistake!And it wasnt just my steak that went wrong. The birthday girl's steak was overdone too... so obviously we sent it back to the kitchen. She also took the opportunity to change hers to the veal which looked good and turned out to be a smart option.Hers turned out great and mine came medium - alittle red in the middle, no blood and slightly tough to cut. At this point the manager came over and when i said "i asked for medium rare!" He looked at it and said.. "medium.. opps" and he took my plate back into the kitchen.3rd time finally medium rare - by then i lost my appetite and i couldnt even swallow 1/4 of it. I cant say i'm impressed to be paying 40+ for a steak that takes 3 tries to get right. Best french in town? No chance really

1st I am shocked they erased my last review, that was basically the same as the one i am writing now.If not giving a 5 point review makes you undesirable, then what is the point to write a review.So I repeat what i said in my past review.The service was good and pro, fast and friendly, timing was right from starters to dessert.The food is okay, but at that high price tag, my colleagues and I would have expected more than just okay food. So in that respect it was a real disappointment.The wine list is really extensive, but again it is on the (very) high side of prices.In the end, a restaurant is about what you have in your plate and in your glass.Unfortunatly it was a disappointment on both for my colleagues and myself.Way too pricey for what they propose

I know there are many great reviews for Absinthe, but I just have to add what a great night we had for my birthday. My wife and seven year old daughter joined me and we had a really terrific time. The food was marvellous and the staff clearly enjoyed working there. I will be back very soon. It was expensive but not was worth the money spent.Well don

I have been to Absynthe many times I like the food, I like the constancy of it, the professionalism of the service, which is unique in Singapore. Culturally table service is not considered as a job in Asia, waiter do not really get a lot of attention and it explains the poror quality of it even in high class hotel or restaurant.. In Absynthe it is not perfect, but is almost there and most of waiters know their job. Treat and serve fine.. Pay attention to wine choices and check price on the list if you ask for some advice. Not everybody is driving a lamborghini... And this in consideration, you will feel like a prince. More than nic

We dined here for the first time on Saturday evening and already the Absinthe has made its way to the top of our restaurant chart!Usually, we make our initial dining choices in Singapore based on the Miele listing, friend’s recommendations or other ‘Guide’ books and magazines. While we use TA extensively for holiday planning, this is the first time we have taken a recommendation for Singapore, and what good taste you all have!Absinthe thoroughly deserves to be at the top of the pile, offering excellent quality food with an informal, relaxed ambience and great staff.Compared to other French restaurants in a similar price bracket, Absinthe is head and shoulders above the competition.The décor and ambience are just right, suiting both relaxed dining and more formal gatherings. It’s lively and there is a real buzz about the place.The waiters made excellent food recommendations, main portions are more than generous and there is also a great cheese selection.We spent $540 between two but this included a bottle of wine, two glasses of champagne, two glasses of port and two glasses of absence. If you can resist the alcohol, you can eat for under $100 per head which I consider excellent value for a restaurant of this quality.We are now thinking of an excuse to return as soon as possible……

We've been going to Absinthe now for about 2 years, and we've probably been there at least 10 times now. Usually we go to celebrate one of our birthdays (we are a family of 4). From our very first visit, Philippe made us feel special and the staff were very friendly and conversational. The food has always impressed...the tastes, flavours, presentation, creativity. A real credit to Francois, the ever-smiling chef in charge of his kitchen. We have, on special occasions, asked him to prepare a special menu and our only requests were that both his signature pork belly and foie gras had to be on the menu. You will savour the wow factor in every mouthful. Of course, one of the highlights for us is to have some absinthe, the real green fairy stuff that Philippe will make for you with his special water dripping machine. A great way to end an excellent evening

We got a table very late in the day, and were glad to get one to be honest, given the reputation of this restaurant. We booked for 6.30pm on the understanding we would vacate the table by 8.30pm and this was fine by us. We even arrived early to avoid it being too great a rush, but we were ushered through to the bar next door until our table was ready, and we were ok with this too. The head waiter was quite attentive to begin with but, frankly, seemed a little distracted, and I felt that personal touch that top restaurants typically have in dealing with their customers was lacking somewhat. One was left feeling he was going through the motions. Indeed, the waiting staff all seemed a little rushed and edgy, perhaps over eager to ensure customers were attended to as quickly as possible. In our case, clearing the table in time for the booking at 8.30pm seemed to be a preoccupation. We ordered dessert and coffee at 7.50pm, and were amazed that we were served with the coffee before the dessert arrived. We sent it back and requested that it be served after we had finished dessert, which it was, but we were then asked to sit at the bar to drink our coffee. We agreed to do so -- even though it was only 8.15pm -- and we had still to finish our bottle of wine which, I hasten to add, I had to pour myself after the main course when the waiting staff went missing in action. On the plus side, the food was great, but given I value good service so highly, I can only give this restaurant an average mark overall. I even had to ask for soap to be placed in the gents toilet early on! This sort of thing should be fundamental preparation before opening the doors of the restaurant I would have thought. Would we go back? Probably. Everyone deserves a second chance, I just hope next time we are treated like valued customers rather than traffic passing through

Lovely night out for us grown ups while the children were with friends...what a lucky choice. Divine food, wine and ambiance with professional yet friendly service. Wouldn't change a thing here, they really know what they are doing and the place was full. Reservations a must, you can't do better for an anniversary or birthday dinner

This restaurant caught my eye as it received good reviews in tripadvisor and it definitely did not disappoint! It was a lovely place to dine while in Singapore and also the reviews about the degustation were not exaggerated.I'd managed to book a table for my wife and I and lucky we did because even mid-week this restaurant was full. Although the tables were busy it didn't detract from the atmosphere of the place. It was cosy without being too small and the service was impeccable. My wife and I ordered the degustation without thinking twice and even while waiting we did not have to worry about our drinks being topped up. The drinks list at Absinthe was extensive and it also offered a variety of international wines including a lot of french labels. I found the prices outrageous and costing more than actual dinner itself but this was not a reflection of the restaurant but rather Singapore's alcohol costs. Coming from a country that prides itself on wines and also experiencing Italy and other wine countries where good wines are abundant and cheaply available, I couldn't bare to have wine at the restaurant. The degustation was served at appropriate intervals and we did not have to lift a finger to call a waiter to bring on the next course. By the end of it we were nicely filled but I also partaked in their selection of cheeses that was wheeled to us on a massive cart to choose from!At the end of the night what really embedded this restaurant in my mind was the fact that the manager asked if we needed transportation and tried calling for a cab! While dialling he actually noticed a taxi down the end of the street and actually RAN down the road to hail the cab! This was above and beyond service we've experienced before in Singapore and was such a lovely finish to an amazing experience. Definitely worth the cost of the meal and we will be visiting again

As an expat in Singapore, I have to say this is our 2nd favorite restaurant. The food & service is always wonderful & the ambiance is lovely. French food at its finest!

Francois is just amazing

We went their for a date with my fiancee and evertything was perfect.The place is really nice, the food was stunning and the service impeccable. I would definitvely recomment this place to anyone who want to have a really good french food at a decent price. (and I'm french).A must try place

Singapore has a plethora of good to decent French restaurants. Absinthe seamlessly combines all of the elements for a wondeful dining experience. From the warm welcome of Philippe to the fine linens and glassware to the exciting wine list (needing a bit of cleaning up however as many bins are out of stock) to the excellent food and service Absinthe has it all. Apart from the small quibble with the wine list the only other shorcoming of the restaurant is the service of the normally excellent oysters which would be much improved by being well chilled. Prices are fair for the quality received and when it is available the venison is outstanding as is the double wagu beef rib. It is not a static menu but favorites are almost always there mixed with a few new dishes reflecting care in selecting what is available in season. For us this is the top French restaurant in Singapore
5
This restaurant came recommended by the Shangri-La concierge and we weren't disappointed! Arguably one of the best dining experiences I have ever enjoyed, fantastic food, great wine, knowledgable friendly service and a quiet sophisticated ambience.....will definately be back at the earliest opportunity.....a must for a memorable night out in Singapore...

We had a nice lunch here last week. From the moment we opened the door the service was excellent. The food overall was good, though for the price I would have expected a little better. The Kingfish cerviche entree was very good, though not the best I have eaten. My partner had the soup de jour, which he said was OK. I ordered beef cheeks, which are my favourite dish, and it didn't disappoint. Succculent, tasty and tender. My partner ordered venison and it was also good. I enjoyed the cheese selection too. The wine list is extensive and very pricey. Overall I would recommend this restaurant, but I don't think it is vey good value for money

I have been there for business lunch. The place is situated in the same block than Oso, the italian counter part. What i liked: Good wine listNice atmosphere although a bit darkish and coldGreat service, fast and very pro.What i disliked: Dishes are a bit too simple for this price range (over 800 sgd for 3 pers with 2 bottles)I would have expected a bit more elaboration in my plates.Wines are expensiv

I tried the brand new a la carte menu, short but very cleaverly done so that there is something for everyone. I had the pan fried goose liver on a bed of tart fruit confit and blini. The goose liver and fruit confit were excellent, cooked to perfection with the tart fruit taking some the fattiness of the goose liver. The blini was a little bitter and not really needed in this superb dish. Followed by Venison which was perfectly cooked, the mini beet root and devine sauce adding to a great flavour. Unfortunetly the outside of the meat was cold when it came to the table, presumeably having waited for my lunch companions dish to be finished. The meat was tasty, tender and when served promptly will be a delight to eat. Had my all time favourite dessert - rhubard crumble with clotted cream - loved it. The triumph of Absinthe has got to be it's wine list. Take a meander through the wine regions of France and I dare you to find one wine that is not appropriate to the food served at Absinthe. Even the wine by the glass is a great selection providing the opportunity to try some great wines at affordable prices with your food. Will I go again YES definately I have to try all the rest of the dishes on the menu

After trying their sister italian restaurant next door, we decided to try this french do. We had the private room sitting 8. The bread was freshly made and the french butter was so creamy, salty and frangrant that my frend bought a box after dinner. I had the foie gras and my friends had the soups, salads, and special scampi appetiser, no complaints there. We mainly had the beef mains. My tenderloin and my friend seated next to me had the doneness mixed up by the waiter, and they had to re-do it. Others had the wagyu chataeubriand beef and I had a slice, which was delicious. We were too full to order individual desserts and the pushy waiter egged on with the dessert platter. He was pushy throughout the evening, with the starter, mains, desserts, and absinthe, a pity. The absinthe was prepared the traditional way by pouring into a glass on a cube of sugar on a spoon. It tasted like cough mixture. The wine list was also extensive, and we had the cote-du-rhone chateauneuf du pape, which was a good mix priced wine, if you don't want to pay for the pomerol

Excellent venue for a special occasion or more relaxed dining experience. We opted for the Absinthe Special Menu. Three appetizers: Lobster Ravioli, Hokkaido Scallops, followed by the Foie Gras on Blini. Lamb for our Main Course. Next, the French Cheese Selection, with an added charge but worth the money. Hazelnut Ice Cream for dessert. All-in-all, the kitchen came up to our expectaions. Comprehensive wine-list with many First Growths and their Second Wines. Outstanding service from the young waitstaff. The Chef/Owner himself takes the trouble to come out and check with each table about the dishes
