Good food and superb drinks in a small hideaway near Boat Quay, but not on the touristic trail.
Try it! Well worth the effort finding the way to this little gem on a rooftop where you expect it the least.
5
They have large selection of single malt whiskey. The view at night is really great. I recommend this place.
5
Cool place to have a drink and take in the view. Staff were nice and offered us a table even when we don’t have a booking. Oysters were good and drinks were reasonably price. Good place to bring guest.
4
Nice rooftop bar with great view over the city. Wonderful oysters and good selection of wines. Service is fast.
5
...for wonderful views and outstanding food. The views of the CBD speak for themselves, just look at the pictures. Also, the food we tried was absolutely delicious: sliders and toasties especially. It's not a cheap place to eat and drink but I think it was worth it. Service was also quick and friendly
4
A place for a drink or two! Walked in without a reservation but managed to get a table for two people, as we also wanted to have some food. The food was small snack portions so if you have a big hunger not the place for a huge appetite. I would go again, with view and drinks on my mind. I would expect to be able to have faster service and also attention for additional orders as well as paying process at the end. The service was therefore average in my opinion. If foods and service could improve this would be really an extra with a location like this
5
We made reservations for 3 people and we were delighted to see the amazing spot the server chose for us facing a magnificent view of Boat Quay.With great company and great service, I couldn’t rave about this place enough. Every dish we ordered, from the sliders to the wine, was absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for a memorable visit. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Singapore to check this place out for amazing quality food and service with an epic view!

This is a great place to come for drinks and admire the Singapore skyline. The Happy Hour isn't anything special, but you're paying for the views. We stuck to the Fürstenberg beer which was $8++ for a small glass during the HH and $10++ afterwards. Good atmosphere and efficient staff
5
They don’t accept reservations on the same day. I would recommend to reserve a table or a balcony on the river side. Can be quite noisy so if you get the table I recommended, you’re might hear your companion. Great to come for the sunset, at 6:30 +.Just a bar with some snacks. No food
5
Breezy rooftop, fantastic view of the city, we absolutely love the vibes the place gives and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. What a great find!! The drinks were interesting and value for money, but what blew us away was the outstanding service. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, and very helpful We had the oyster platter that was delish, overall an exceptional place with great vibes
4
Southbridge seems to be one of the underrrated rooftop bars in the city. It's tucked away in Boat Quay but has one of the best views of the city and river I've seen, especially around sunset.
5
Rooftop bar with great views over the city. Drinks weren't too expensive, food was good, very relaxed on a Sunday evening. Thoroughly recommend.
4
This bar is tucked away at one end of Boat Quay. It is not easy to find, but once you get the lift to the 5th floor you will have escaped the tourist hustle and bustle of Boat Quay and will be able to take in the view of the river and the older part of Singapore. It is best bar in the area. Get a table overlooking the river and soak up the atmosphere. The staff and very friendly - the food is pretty good too. Just donâ€™t tell too many people about it!
5
Visited Southbridge on a Friday evening after trying to find a nice place to hang out and catch up with an ex-schoolmate. Judging from reviews read, Southbridge offers a fantastic view of the city and river and I must say that it was pretty accurate! Perched on the fifth floor of a small building in Boat Quay, the view was breathtaking and I guess I was also lucky that it was a rather breezy night with full moon in sight. The staff were really nice but as it was a rather small area packed with other guests, it was a bit difficult to get their attention. Absolutely enjoyed the kick of the Southern Belle while my friend settled for Wo De Mei Ren and we also had the beef and pork sliders, which were pretty decent. Overall experience was great and despite the price we had to pay for what we had, Southbridge is definitely one of the top players for being a nice chill out rooftop bar
5
I read that the Southbridge Bar has one of the best views in Singapore and whilst it's not a birds-eye aerial view from up high, you get a fantastic panoramic view of the Singapore River from Boat Quay which is especially impressive at night when everything is lit up. It's a fairly small bar so we booked a table for 7.30pm and the entrance door is at the REAR of the building, there's no signage. Whilst the drinks aren't cheap ($61 for 3 drinks), it's worth it for the breathtaking views, relaxed vibe and fabulous photos that you can impress your family and friends with
4
Right first things first. Singapore is extremely expensive but great as a city. The southbridge hotel has the smallest room I have ever stayed in but gave me all the good facilities that you would want form the hotel.The bar is nice with a few gigs on at night. This place is right next to all the places you would ever want to go in the city center.If you are a business traveler or someone in the city for a day or two this is ur little lovely hotel
4
We went there for drinks on a Friday night. It was very busy, but we got a spot at the bar. The views are very good, I understand why this place is popular. I would visit again, maybe during the day to avoid the after work crowd
5
One of my Favourite rooftop bars in Singapore , location is great just between Boat and Clarke Quay . They serve great drinks and light food at good quality , love the oysters . The view from here is amazing , great atmosphere and very service minded team
5
Though I wouldn't typically describe a rooftop bar as intimate, somehow Southbridge manages to be cozy (but not congested). The small size adds to its charm, and the bar is at the perfect elevation for spectacular 360 viewing of Singapore's sensational skyline. The hostess went out her way to find us a comfortable spot at the bar, and the bartenders were top notch. Extra points for allowing our foursome to linger (after closing) to finish our bottle
5
The perfect place to go and have a nice chat and great cocktails and drinks. The open air bar allows for a nice breeze and great views whilst having a drink. It isn't really big so make sure you get up early and get a seat
4
Definitely recommend dropping by Southbridge rooftop bar for a few pre/post dinner drinks. More intimate and better atmosphere then the bigger sky-bars you would come across. Also offers a great view over Singapore.
5
One of the most breath taking view over Singapore, in a quite, intimate place.
Very romantic and peaceful.
Not having a huge menu list in terms of food, but perfect for a drink and a snack before/ after dinner.
Absolutely TO DO if in Singapore!
4
Very cool roof top setup with some amazing views. The place isn't too big, but I wouldn't call it cosy.
Had some really nice pork sliders here
4
I met a friend at Southbridge for pre-dinner drinks and oysters on a Monday night. The location is excellent with sweeping views over Boat Quay. It was happy hour, which meant cheaper drinks and oysters. We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters for S$20 and with a few drinks the total bill exceeded S$65. It was nice, but a little too pricey
5
The Southbridge is a really nice bar!Cocktails are nice, the view is perfect and the service is amazing (and obviously, it's not the same everywhere in Singapore!).Fo not hesitate to go there to have a good cocktail with a view on MBS or Singapore River!Excellent address
4
Each time I come in Singapore I go to the Southbridge rooftop. From the rooftop you have an amazing view on Singapore, specially during the night. The place is quite and intimate at the opposite of the big and noisy rooftops. They don't have huge menu list but it's enough if you're here to have some cocktails.Staff is really nice
2
Been here 3 times over the period of a year. I really wanted to like this place cuz the view and vibe was great. The service was attentive and friendly too. BUT I just don't get the cocktails. It all sounds so good on the menu, but when I tasted it, it was absolutely disgusting. I have ALWAYS finished my drink, even if it's not great (especially since these fancy cocktails are quite pricey), but this time I just had to say screw it, it's not worth it to suffer. Maybe I was unlucky with a bartender or drink or the stars just didn't align. But it has definitely scarred me for life and I will never order a cocktail there again. I went back there again (cuz of the view), ordered a beer and called it a night. Chill. (The cocktail I ordered was a tequila based one. Had some amazing tequila cocktails before and thought this would be good too...but NO.
4
Great view and cool casual hidden away place.Food was un-convincing for a trendy bar - smoked salmon and cheese toasts were nice, pulled pork sliders and pasta were only average. Red wine served at refrigerator temperature.I would go again as the venue is fantastic but would try cocktails rather than wine, and order different food
4
Roof top bar that will take reservations (but hit your credit card if you don't turn up - or so stated). Ask for seats at the outer edge of the terrace (not at the bar) for the best views of Marina Bay, the river and nightly light show (8 pm and 9.30). Some of the small plates (all the food they serve) were quite good, you could make a pleasant meal of it if required. Likely to be crowded, used by the locals as an after-works drinks venue, but everyone knows the drill: if you have a booking people are quickly moved
4
This is a very cool place to go for a few evening drinks before heading out for super on Boat Quay. Lovely view out over Singapore, albeit from only a 5th floor perspective. This I actually found nicer as you get a great view over some of the older buildings in Singapore and yet get still cannot miss MBS and the CBD.
5
annabel is awesome ... thks for the perfect service .. we had very good food , very good service .. food was so nice , waiters very friendly
5
We were told by friends to stop here for a drink. It is such a great bar. Super views, great service. The pork sliders and seared tuna were both winners. Will definitely be back on our next visit.
4
Little small place hiding on the roof top but they offer a very good view of Singapore.
You should go around 6:30 or 7pm to see the sunset if it not rain.
Good drink and friendly stuff :)
4
It's not easy to find the entrance to a place, but if you're lucky enough, then it offers a beautiful view to a panorama of Boat Quay. The place is pretty small, so reserve a table on the front, better at the right corner, if you look at the Boat Quay.They have quite a good choice of food and cocktails and the food is pretty goodUsually full of people after 7 pm, especially on Fridays.Service - they're doing their best, but it's not easy when they're full!A nice getaway for a drink after a work week or to show famous panorama to your guests
4
This entrance is on the main road going to Boat Quay. Very cool little bar with nice views. I don't think a lot of people know it's there. My piece of advice in Singapore is to look up! Tons of roof bars you have no idea are there until you do.
5
The bar is on top of the establishment and is worth your money with an array of amazing drinks and cocktails. What I love is when you have you drinks while looking at the wonderful views of the Parliament plus you get to see the dancing lights of the MBS and the famous Singapore's ferries wheel
1
Another establishment which has the potential to be so much better but fails miserably due to it's discourteous and uncivilised staff.Is welcoming patrons really such a difficult concept to grasp? 'Manners makers the man' The male Filipino on staff in particular ought to be reprimanded for his rude hosting...Certainly won't be returning..
3
Great night last night, we organized a business get together party of 10, loads of booze and food. Great view, cute bites, service okay. Was a warm night so we made comment that there should be fans, like they did at the back bar. One staff rolled her eyes, told us, "this is Singapore, if you want fan, go stand at the bar" The fans btw is inside the bar. Not sure if this is joke or sarcasm in my face but well done Southbridge for great customer service! Give Annabel a medal
5
This hidden gem is a fantastic rooftop bar with great views of the city - both new and old. Perfect stop for a pre or post dinner drink. It can be hard to find, but if you find the tucked away elevator and go to the 5th floor you will find a breath taking view of Singapore with a finely crafted cocktails to wet your palette
5
This small cocktail bar gives a retro, yet classic feel and has a fantastic array of new and old cocktail recipes on the menu. More reasonably priced than other rooftop bars in Singapore, Southbridge gives you a perfect view of Boat Quay giving you an ideal spot to see the laser show from Marina Bay at 8pm. You can sit by the bar and talk with the very friendly waiting staff or find a stool at the edge of the building overlooking the water and watch the ferry boats chug along
4
Great location great view. Small rooftop bar like most in Singapore with fantastic views over the river.
Great way to end a nice evening with a cold drink. Would go again very relaxing
5
Been here for chance and spent a lovely time. Great staff, good drinks and amazing view! They don't stay open till late (it was midnight when they asked us for a last drink I guess..), we wished to stay more to enjoy this beautiful place!
5
Southbridge is a great place, our favorite one for drinks in Singapore. Cosy atmosphere, great views, very friendly service, good drinks. Simply perfect. Will go back every time when in Singapore.
5
Really reasonable and atmospheric spit, right in the heart of things. Troublesome location to find, round the back of Boat Quay, but brilliant rooftop location. Lovely service, reasonable prices for happy hour and good bar snacks.
5
Nice cocktails, amazing view, lounge music. Quite good!
Service level is 5 out of 5 for Singapore.
Nice place to go for a drink
5
Situated at Boat Quay, this bar is a must to visit. Just love the perfect location. Service is prompt and efficient. Great selection of drinks. There is seriously no flaw about this place.
5
Like this place very much.
Great cocktails and nice rooftop bar atmosphere. The chairs are a bit bulky but otherwise I would recommend this place for couples or group of friends for afterwork drinks or even romantic (quiet weekdays) evening.
4
Drinking in Singapore is not a cheap activity! So if you do it you might as well go to a fun place with a view !!! Great roof top bar which you have to try , the owner is very welcoming as are all the staff. Crisp service and a wonderful view. To reserve a table there is a very steep minimum spend which I disagree with , but plenty of people are prepared to pay it!!!!!! Book or go early for a sea
5
I was told not to write anything about this bar by friends who took me there as they did not want it becoming too popular. This is a hidden gem in Singapores bar scene. Overlooking the river and the CBD it is a lovely palce to have a drink and some nibbles whilst taking in the view. The service was great, but you are not guaranteed a table in the prime spot, even on a Tuesday. Anyway I wanted to share this with you even though others want to keep it a secret, but its too good to not tell everyone. Enjoy
5
I had a few trips to this bar, my Son took us and you would struggle to find if not taken there by a local. Prices and service are reasonable and even better when happy hour occurs. We only ever had drinks when we went but the views from the main bar area (rooftop) will blow you away. A highlight of my visit to Singapore, simply because of the views
5
Fantastic venue if you're visting Singapore for a short trip and want to take in the view of the skyline whilst also being in the atmosphere of a busy bustling bar in Boat Quay.
Definitely would recommend.
5
This bar boasts one of the best views on the bay, in a very refined environment. This place feels very intimate and unique, perfect for special occasions or just treating yourself.
4
Lovely rooftop bar at one end of boat quay with great views of the city especially at night. It starts to get busy after about 7pm so you might want to think about a reservation. Food menu is limited but the food I have tried here has always been deliciou
4
In case the view isn't good enough reason to visit (a few floors up, overlooking Boat Quay & the CBD) then I experienced some of the best service I've ever had at a bar in Singapore before (OK, so there's not generally much competition, but this was actually really good service - makes such a refreshing change!)Great drinks, great bar snacks (pulled pork slides - delicious) great venue. It's fairly small though, so get there early or try to book a table in advance. Will definitely return
4
The bar is right at the top of hotel and really breathtaking views of Singapore. There is limited seating so you might need to wait for a table. Drinks are pricey are one would expect in a place like this but it really is worth going up for a views and having a couple of cold beers
4
Southbridge is located on the top floor of a nondescript building in Boat Quay. The view is quite nice.We had cocktails and a mix-platter of oysters. Loved both of them. Their snack menu is rather limited, though the pulled pork sliders we ordered were juicy so no complaints there
5
Southbridge is loacted on Boat Quay, Right at one end (entrance to Southbridge roof bar is behind seven eleven on your left almost at the end of the bridge . Hence the name :)I met up with a client there and this venue was his suggestion. I rocked up nearly an hour before him because i wasnt sure of its exact location and didnt want to be late. Anyway the waitress took my order immediately and showed me to a seat . The bar is in an elevated postiton being on the roof of a hotel. The views are across Boat Quay and are a delight to take in with the iconic MBS buiding in the distance and the shadow of the large banking buidlings across the quay . It was an ideal place to watch the sun go down . Upon the arrival of my client we ordered some oysters, which were in fact delicious so we ordered some more and then more. accompanied with many beers . Great little place with a buzzing atmosphere. It does get busy as the night becomes late . mainly with "city" workers enjoying an after work sharpener or two. It has a less Singaporean feel than some of the tourist trap bars do and this lends i believe to its apparent success. Will most certianly be back for another visit 
5
This roof top bar in Boat Quay is an absolute must. It not only has the most amazing views of the river and Singapore at night but it has the most amazing wines and tapas food. The atmosphere is electric and the staff are just wonderful. A very pleasant evening
4
Excellent for sundowners, good service, knowledgeable staff, beautiful location. An outdoor bar that gives you a view over the skyline at the hub of the financial district, with views of Marina Bay Sands and a very good place to view the light show at Marina Bay Sands
4
1) Food quality~ awesome oysters in different varieties are priced reasonably~ oysters are succulent and big (value for money). On one occasion, I had 15 at a go!~ not much food selection. Tried several dishes and oysters is only item in menu I will recommend. Go somewhere else for dinner before heading there I suggest- prices of alcohol is almost standard bar price you will find elsewhere 2) Service~ good despite the main area of Southbridge is more crowded and the other side (not so good view compared to the main) less crowd but staff diligently make their rounds to ensure customers are taken care of3) Ambience~ I can visualise the place if made available only for couples, it will be very romantic~ like any bar scene, can be noisy~ I like to sit at the corner nearest to "Southbridge" road. Will I return? Definitely, for the oysters!!!
4
Southbridge is a nice rooftop bar with a good view on Boat Quay. You might want to go there for a drink before having lunch somewhere down on Boat Quay. Not many beers but a good choice of drinks. Could be crowded on Fridays.
3
It's a nice place to have a couple of drinks after a busy day at work but the selection of drinks is pretty limited. I visited last Friday night and have to change my options three times due to non availability.
5
Maybe the best view in Singapore, perfectly overlooking the river, MBS, Flyer and the parliament!
And while doing so enjoying a drink which is served by very attentive staff!
5
Definitely one of the nicer rooftop bars in the business district. Unlike other rooftop bars with killer prices and lousy views (went to one which stares at a neighbouring skyscraper ...*yawns*), Southbridge has a panoramic view of the best places (think: Marina Bay Sands, Raffles Place, Parliament House and Victoria Concert Hall) without wallet-burning prices. Happy hours from Mondays to Fridays and boast a healthy selection of drinks for all tastebuds. Bartender whips up lively concoctions and has bar-bites such as Wagyu sliders and oysters.Will definitely come back again and maybe, think of hosting a few client/corporate events (perfect size...if it's not raining) ....
4
This is a great place for late night drinks, great view great service. The bar has a great vibe and a great place to relax and unwind after work or after dinner, go with friends its worth the visit. The drinks are good and well priced
4
Popped in here for happy hour during a recent trip to Singapore. We were looking for an outdoor venue to enjoy the view and a little breeze, and this place delivered. It has a limited food menu, but we had a few small bites and found everything great. Cocktails were a good size and reasonably strong, and well made. Great place for a respite from the city
4
Saturday night drinks here. Not the tallest building around here, but the view is spectacular. Really allows a great perspective on the scale and sight of Singapore city skyline. Service was polite and attentive. Drinks a bit overpriced but you have to pay for that view. Recommended

So we figured that this would be the perfect location to view the fireworks for National Day, but it quickly turned into a nightmare. Southbridge finally started taking reservations for groups under 10 a we had a pleasant experience the past few times we had gone, so we made a reservation for the timing of the fireworks. The reservation form was specific, that each reservation was for a 2 hour block and there would be a S$200 minimum for the table. We thought that would be reasonable for the view so we reserved a table for 2 in the 8-10pm block. We arrived 20 minutes early just to make sure we did not miss our block or the fireworks. When we went up the first thing that we were told was that there was no more space and we would have to leave. When we said we had reservations to 3 different people and were told to "Hold on" as they disappeared and another random server would come up to us 10 minutes later and ask us what we wanted. When someone finally looked at the reservations, they informed us that the only location they had available for our block was behind the building by the toilets where we could not see the river, the stadium, Marina Bay, the Fullerton or the fireworks.We were then granted the privilege of standing in a corner while other people with no reservations barged past the random servers that told them there was no room and set up at the bar or in the front with no intention to purchase anything. Not that it would have mattered because after we stood in our corner for almost 45 minutes we were finally granted the opportunity to buy one drink, but only after informing us they were out of several liquors and and we needed to put down a credit card since we had "chosen" not to occupy our table yet. The "block" reservations clearly were not enforced or even considered, since everyone at the front of the bar had either no reservations and just showed up and stayed in the front or had early reservations and no intention to leave after 2 hours. During the hour and a half that we stood in our corner and waited for the fireworks, we were not even asked if we wanted another drink, which even by Singapore standards was the one with the least amount of alcohol yet. When we were able to get a table next to the bar, we had to bus it ourselves because the waitstaff couldn't be pulled away from chatting with one another or with the table of women, then we had to physically stop a waiter to wipe off all the spilled drinks from the table. The same waiter then proceeded to spill a drink on our feet that he was clearing from the table next to us. And then we sat and waited yet again. It took 20 minutes for anyone to ask whether we had ordered, so we requested simple drinks that would be difficult to make incorrectly, take a long time or not make at all, a bourbon on the rocks and a glass of white wine. We ordered and watched as the four bartenders struggled to make any drink besides pulling a bottle out of the cooler (which surprisingly was also an issue when another customer had to borrow the cork screw to open their own bottle of wine). After 15 minutes and two other confused waiters stopped to stare at us before asking if we had ordered yet, we received our second beverages, this being 2 hours into the ordeal.We were able to order some food, which I will not even bother getting into as the lobster rolls were just premixed and slathered on a roll, the chili crab was ragu on a cold piece of bread, and the tuna tataki was clearly not fully thawed out. When we finally met our S$200 minimum (which we were informed that we would be charged for regardless of even with everything we had dealt with), we could not run out of there fast enough. Luckily McDonald's delivers late into the evening and we were able to find another bar to grab some reasonable drinks in.Two emphatic thumbs down. I could not rate as 0 stars but that is what was deserved. I will never return, and I would encourage anyone who has any sense to avoid at all costs. There are much better oyster places with just as good of a view
4
This place is amazing. Every time I go it is very busy. A very good place to wine & dine, food is of an exceptional standard & the views are awesome.Oysters & Champagne whilst relaxing outside in the cool breeze & taking in awesome sights of Singapore, does not get much better.Itâ€™s a must do whilst in Singapore
4
Whether it's a Friday night drink or weekend evening drinks, this place has a nice vibe and view. Situation on a rooftop, this drinks venue will wowed you, with the attentive staff, amazing view, great drinks and small bites, this place would definitely be a memory to many who visits here. The only con about this place is, you may smoke anywhere which might be a little annoying if the guy next to you keep puffing away. Overall a great place and will be a regular here
4
Awesome location with great cocktails and relaxed vibe. Chilled music in the background and a cool breeze made thisa great evening spot with friends.
5
The Southbridge is a cool rooftop bar with a beautiful view towards Marina Bay Sands. We visited upon a recommendation during a business trip to Singapore. The oysters were delicious and the cocktails divine with a unique blend of flavours.
5
the rooftop is amazing and makes it fun to hang out for a drink or two, staff is super friendly and the happy hour choices are awesome!
5
Great cocktails, fun snacks, awesome bartender and good service. Highly recommended...still small and undiscovered. Evening / night view of the Singapore River and the scene makes for great conversation and fun pics.
3
Rooftop bar with a spectacular, calm view of the marina, which is a nice way to show visitors some of Singapore while downing oysters during happy hour. The oyster quality isn't amazing, but it's good value for money. Make sure they log your orders during happy hour- once they overcharged us b/c the order was logged in the system after happy hour had wnded. Decent drinks. Great place for dates- just enough of a buffer while retaining a casual atmosphere for conversation
4
I swear it was so tough to find this area; most of the locals we asked around haven't even heard about them. I was on the verge of giving up looking for this place until i saw their black and white signage while walking along Boat Quay. Bingo finally found it after like, an hour or more?It's a small rooftop bar perhaps could not fit large crowd but decent enough for a late evening chillout spot to be as it has great view of Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay and the financial hubs. Limited choices of food on the menu but you should try out the osyter as i think it was pretty good. The drinks weren't half as bad as they had mine done pretty good on a greygoose vodka. A relaxing place to be and staffs were very attentive to check on us and ensure that things are alright
5
Located on the third storey of a tucked away building, this bar offers one of the best view of boat quay.We went up during new year count down and had a front row seat of the amazing fire work. the wait staff are friendly and funny. and the drinks are just absolutely deliciously.without a doubt my favourite bar in singapore
5
Great views over Boat Quay and Parliament House. Staff really make this rooftop bar. Friendly, attentive and most importantly generous in their gin pouring they great everyone with a smile a give this cool after work spot a great vibe. No better place to go for happy hour, Bombay Sapphires are $10! Wagyu sliders are also excellent
5
I think its the best view in Singapore, combining views of the older part of town and new skyline.Great drinks list, quality cocktails and interesting menu - with high quality food.We take all out visitors here to see a great view of Singapore with food and drink to match
4
This is definitely somewhere to take your special guest or visitors. Commanding views over boat quay and great views of Marina Bay Sands. The bar is suitable for every occasion and is modern and yummy food. Great service and very accommodating staff. Its a pretty new place so doesn't get too crowded
