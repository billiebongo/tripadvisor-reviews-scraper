Friendly and thoughtful service provided again by Fifi! She went out of her way to make us feel welcome. Looking forward to visiting the new premises in 2018.Thank you.

Very good service (ask for Helen & Fifi, both friendly & helpful). Starter portions are OK but prices are on the high side. Good place for a pre-movie or a pre-dinner business meeting

In Singapore it can be hard to find quality wines at reasonable prices. This bar delivers. There's no skyline view, it's fairly understated but they deliver a very nice selection of wines for $15 or so a glass.

Good place to pop into for a rest and glass of wine after traipsing around Orchard Rd. I didn't have any food but was impressed by the wine list. Quality and well chosen wines though I've only tried 2 there so far.

Went there for a drink to chill out with my girlfriend after dinner. Usually order white wine but decided to order red wine instead (since their white selection wasn't that attractive.... probably due to the bar is shutting down for renovation soon).Do check out their wine by the glass, very affordable white and red. Particularly the Chablis and Barolo! Didn't really try a lot of their bar bites, truffle fries was all we had. Service was also the highlight of the evening. The friendly female Sommelier, Helen, not only process an expansive knowledge in wine, but very patient and passionate about sharing all she knows relating to wine and food. We were also having a great time amused by her sense of humour! Definitely look forward to visit their up and coming new bar in the coming new year

If you have exhausted your shopping at the ION Orchard, this is a short walk. Prices for wine are quite reasonable by Singapore standards. A bottle of the lesser known but very good Bruno Paillard champagne was $SG 115 (plus 10% service charge plus 7% tax, which is standard practice in Singapore). A very good clams and spicy pork sausage in tomato salsa was $SG 28 ++. If you prefer wines by the glass they listed some interesting choices such as a Spanish albarino and a Piedmontese arneis at around the $SG 14-16 ++ mark. I can't comment on pour sizes about which some other reviewers have complained

Its been a few years since my last negative review and I really wanted to give this another try. So here's the breakdown:1. Decor: They've definitely upgraded the decor since last time. What makes this place is the subtle lighting and dark wood interior which gives the place an overall understated elegance. Overall, relaxing and quiet and thats just how I prefer to drink my wines.2. Menu (Food): Again food menu has been completely revamped. We ordered the pan seared hokkaido scallops ($16), Pan Seared gambas in white wine ($16) and ceps mushroom with soft boiled egg ($26). All 3 dishes were excellent and perfectly done.3. Menu (wine): I'm a huge relative value guy (which in banking terms means that I appreciate a low mark up rather than 'cheap wines'). As a burgundy fan, I was impressed by a strong list of quality producers such as THIBAULT LIGER-BELAIR, ANNE GROS and FOURRIER. In the end we went for a Nuit st. Georges 2012 by THIBAULT LIGER-BELAIR at $140. For a non burgundy audience, this may seem slightly pricey but for those who understand the market, this was a decent price as it usually retails around $90. The wine was absolutely gorgeous. A feminine wine which becomes more expressive while drinking with notes of dried flowers. Perfect balance. Loved it!4. Service: The manager, Aaron served us throughout our time there. I confess I am picky about service. If I'm spending over $200 for a meal and wine, I do expect good service. Well Aaron was impressive not only because he had a superb knowledge of the burgundy wines but also because he had both charm and a patient temperament which encouraged us to ask him a lot of questions about different wine bottles. 5. Overall: I think if Caveau can keep up its service, food quality and wine prices/choices stay consistent, than this is the BEST wine bar in Singapore in my view. 10/1

We popped in one Saturday afternoon, in need of a glass or wine and a relax away from the hectic world.A very nice space, tall tables, high stools, quality furniture, felt good.Ordered two glasses of wine which when they arrived, I thought were only half measures. I asked and a rather disinterested waitress stated 'that's i, a glass'. We had a difference of opinion on that point.To round off my experience, a couple came in with a screaming baby and proceeded to enjoy their wine while the baby screamed and impacted the enjoyment of others. Not the fault of Caveau Bar, but the fault of selfish 'parents'.Based on the size of the pour and disinterested service, it was expensive and overpriced

We went there to grab a quick bite before the movies at Shaw Centre and the kitchen was able to accommodate us with time to spare. Great rillettes and fresh bread. You must try the baby octopus - the marinara sauce is out of this world.Try to sit facing the inside of the restaurant or the walls/bar. There is a carpark exit across the street and the headlights tend to shine right into the place in the evening

Few facts that you should know:1. I have been visiting Les Amis/Bistro Du Vin/La Strada since 2008 on a regular basis.2. I visited mainly because of their superb quality of staff, their extensive wine list and their low mark ups and the high quality of the food.3. Just because I'm rating Caveau with a low rating does not mean that Les Amis is not a great group...as a group, its got some wonderful restaurants.Why the low rating?This is what happened tonight:1. We ordered a bottle of Chateau Sociandat Mallet 2009. (SGD 130) It was very closed on the nose and on the palette & there was hardly any fruit. It was just tannic and dry. I told the waitress who opened the bottle. Her reply was: Its 2009 and therefore, "a great vintage like this will normally be closed". Rubbish. I've had other great 2009's that were were great. She has a lot of audacity to make statements like that.2. We went to another waiter who was either German/Austrian who we thought was the manager (in Singapore the problem is, we think any white guy is the manager). We gave him a glass to taste. His reply was "yeah its very closed". And went away. He then suggested another wine (Gevrey Chambertin 1ere cru Rossignol Trapet). That was just ok....nothing to rave on even though price was way marked up @150 SGD. Again, nothing great. Thanks for the suggestion....we could've done better ourselves.3. We finally chose to drink by the glass. Reserve Du Contesse. We had 6 glasses. Even though the wine cost around 160, the bill came to 190!! The could've just given us the bottle instead at 160.My issue is the following: First, if a restaurant/bar admits the wine is closed, then replace it. Or at least, give us some complimentary glasses of house pour.Second, they don't open the wines in front of you. I asked about this and the 'European' waiter said "its the policy of Caveau". This is ridiculous. I'm ordering a bottle of expensive wine and they open it at the back away from the customers. What are they trying to do?? I have never allowed a bottle to behind my back. Even after I had an argument about this, the waiter insisted that he wants to open the wines away from us. What are they trying to hide? I'm wondering if this is a case of fraud?Third, dont offer fine wines if you're not prepared to take them back. The waitress had a terrible attitude. She had no clue about wines but tried to tell us that 2009 was a complex year and this was normal. Similarily the European guy didn't have a clue either. The only one who knew about wines was Aaron, the manager but he didn't seem to want to entertain us until the end.Honestly I have been visiting Les Amis and Bistro Du Vin and La Strada since 2008. This was the worst experience ever and I will never come back to Caveau again. I have a right to be angry. The 3 of us spend 600 over SGD on 3 bottles of average wine and a cheese platter. This poor evening could have been easily resolved if the staff decided to give us a discount/even a free round of drinks. I miss the days when Danny was the manager of Caveau or Bernard the manger of Les Amis Jardin. Things were much better than. Please give this wine bar a miss. Terrible service & I hope the owners of Les Amis are reading this because I will stress again: TERRIBLE SERVICE and a case of FRAUD if waiters are reluctant to open wines in front of you

A full glass here is 15cl and i guess a half a glass less than 10cl. A total rip off. Too bad but a nice concept. Go to hyatt bar on Scott road...

Unfortunately Caveau appears to be out of business. We tried calling the number, and we're told they no longer occupy the space in Orchard (Shaw Center).

Great place for ladies gathering and lovers .
The pasta is delicious , kind of impressive. Good wine selection. We were having red wine.
Good place for hot date!

The bar is located near Orchard road , within walk distance from Hilton and Four Season hotels. The bar has an intimate atmosphere, great selection of wines and food. The services are good and prices are fair.

Tucked away around the corner from Shaw House, this is a great place to duck into for a glass of good wine. Good choice and a nice relaxed vibe.

Nice chilled out place to get some wine. Price is reasonable and ambience is good for conversations !

We were staying at the Grand Hyatt and wanted something quick and close by. It was a Friday night and knowing some of the more popular places around Orchard Road and Scotts would be full we simply walked around for 5 mins or so and stumbles across Caveau Wine & Bar. This place is very modern, the service is efficient and friendly and the tapa's were great. The beer selection is not huge but I suppose it is a wine bar. The wines we enjoyed were good and overall we really enjoyed our time here.

I've been to Caveau 3-4 times now? We would have at least 4 glass of wine each. We love the quality of their wine by the glass. Service is always good. But do make a reservation as there're only 3 tables near the window. This remains our fav. wine place to come. Only downside is the difficulty to get a taxi home at Shaw Centre.

Tucked away in Shaw Center, that was the worst part took me a good 10 minutes getting lost due to the renovations going on. Ambiance is nice. Selections of wines adequate especially if you don't want to go to Dempsey Rd and prefer to stay in town. Tapas is a must try

I have to admit to not being a huge fan of the restaurants of this group but Caveau has taken things down several notches and in the process made it a far more enjoyable experience.My wife and I shared a bottle of wine and a snack at one of the high tables. Service was quick, efficient and done with a smile. The small bit of food we had was a bit so-so but prices are fine on the wine side of things, what's not to like
