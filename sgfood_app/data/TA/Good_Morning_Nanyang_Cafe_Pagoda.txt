Charming old shop cum mini coffee museum. Must-try for tourists to have a taste of local coffee. Good for a quick re-charge and try to local cakes and kuehs while you are there.

A very popular place among locals. Our local friends brought us there after lunch. Tried the traditional toast (pressed toast with Kayla filling) and Kopi (local style coffee), which are so tasty. The price is very affordable, must try for tourists.

This place is yum. Kaya toast is wicked. It's not fine dining and it's not flash, but its yum and fun! Plus they have wifi ;)

Good Morning Nanyang Cafe have a nice coffee museum. Other than that, the food and drinks are pretty normal but the staff are friendly and accommodating. I like the ambience but the quality of the food need to be improved.

Staff are courteous and after a while they remember the type of tea you want (less sugar for eg). I love their wholemeal thick toast with butter. Tea tastes good. Prices are ok.

After dining nearby for lunch, my local friend recommended an iced milk tea to refresh after a spicy meal. We also had a glutenous cake - my first taste...not sweet.- a subtle flavour.
Give it a try..

I loved this. The coffee was delicious. I promptly bought 2 boxes of it to take home as gifts. They were helpful and I emjoyed sitting out drinking the coffee. I only found it by chance but I would urge anyone to go and find it and sample this delicious Singapore coffee

Highly recommend this place for a good, simple, filling breakfast before a day of exploring. The coffee was good (although super sweet), the bread was toasted to perfection, and the eggs were tasty (they might not be your cup of tea if you don't like runny, barely cooked eggs)

On route to the Red Dot Design Museum, we were looking for a place for a quick meal and happened to step into Nanyang morning cafe.Ordered the Chicken curry and rice and a Laksa. Enjoyed the flavour of both dishes.The decor is minimal.The service is pleasant.Pricing is reasonable too

We only stayed in Singapore for a couple of days, however we came here for breakfast twice. The set menus are really good and include toast, tea or coffee, and two runny eggs. The staff were extremely friendly and the service was very quick. If I am ever back in Singapore, I will go there many more times

First time having kaya toast and it did not disappoint! Soft boiled eggs were perfectly cooked. Tea was piping hot and expertly steeped.

Thank you for the yummy food, great service and a smile in the morning :)
My favourite place in Chinatown !

Truly enjoy the CiabattaToast and the yin yang of Good Morning Nan Yang. Taste really great! I have to admit I like it more than Ya Kun and I moved my favorite breakfast in Singapore here haha! They even have been praised on Time Magazine!

If you are a hardcore traditional nanyang coffee, this is the place serving thick and strong aroma nanyang coffee! Breakfast set will energized your kick start of the day. Try coffee with traditional Chinese desserts and cakes to complete the nostalgic of heritage nanyang coffee cultures

If your hotel is in Chinatown, don't miss this place to start a good day.They have the best Kaya toast I ever had. Everything is freshly prepared. Their Kaya is made from their own recipe I think. Its the best one I ever tried. Very nice and courteous staff as well

Kaya toast and kopi for breakfast is ALL you need to get your day started! The bread is toasted to order, so it is still a bit warm when you receive your order. The kaya is spread on expertly, so you don't receive too much to overpower the crispy texture of the toast. I tried the eggs one morning, and wasn't a fan, though apparently they are a popular choice among the locals

Whether eating alone or introducing to friends from overseas, i find Nanyang Old Coffee a great choice, a local eatery brand that i am always proud to present it to friends around the world. Besides the good varieties of local coffee , tea and light bites, i like the simple , well managed , quality drinks and food choices with a rich cultural and heritage embience. The mini museums at the shop rear end have quite an amazing collection that gives you a good look Singapore's history through coffee making. most of the sets, with your selection of coffee, toasts and half boil eggs is a very local way of having breakfast. And compared to the westerned international coffee brands, you will be surprised that the Singapore coffee and tea does has it very unique taste , aroma and very affordable price in all. i personally suggest you to choose the out door seat, that will be a better merge into the culture and heritage of Singapore the little red dot

I had read about their orange ciabatta kaya toast and being a huge kaya toast fan, had to try it out. They're located on the second floor in the aisle just one back from the escalator. It's not a big place but I was getting it to go anyways. There was nobody there when I showed up at 10am but about 8 people came in afterwards for coffee. They warm the toast and prepare it to order so it took about 10 min but the ciabatta toast was warm. This is not a big serving, approx 10cm square, cut in 4 pieces. The orange rind in the ciabatta really does accentuate the kaya toast in a beautiful way however the orange rind is too scarce in the bread. I also found the kaya did not have enough pandan flavour (I love pandan) so overall, while I was happy to try this, I wouldn't go back for more, but I might consider mixing a bit of marmalade with my kaya toast at home

I decided to eat breakfast at the "Good Morning Nanyang Café" in Chinatown as it was just a short 5 minute walk from my Hotel (Bliss Hotel). I opted for the traditional set breakfast (A) which was 2 soft boiled eggs, toast (with a kind of sweet buttery spread on) and a cup of coffee... All for less than SG$5.The eggs come soft boiled and you crack them into a bowl... They were very soft and as I like a well cooked / firm whited egg I struggled to eat them. The toast was okay, although I'm not sure whether I liked the sweetness, and the coffee was so strong my spoon practically stop up in it on it's own accord.Well worth trying once for the experience but I'd not go to this Café again as I did not really enjoy my eggs, my sweet toast or my super strong coffee

Had our brunch at their outlet at Grandstand(Bukit Timah) last week. We were served by a cheerful uncle at the counter. Love their toast and scones with my regular coffee.. They also served curry chicken with rice/bread , stew chicken, meesiam and a variety of toast and cheecheongfun. Really a nice place to pass your time as it is not so crowded even when it is full house. Ambience was wonderful. Would definitely come back for my cuppa soon
