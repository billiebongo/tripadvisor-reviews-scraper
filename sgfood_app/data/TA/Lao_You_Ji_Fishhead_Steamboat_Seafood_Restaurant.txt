Went back to this restaurant last Friday and decided to tried their steamboat. Ordered the grouper fish fillets, mixed balls and the dumpling. Taste really good! Worth eating!

This restaurant is on the street alongside many other restaurants, each trying to entice you to try their food. We chose the Lao You Ji Fish Head Steamboat Seafood Restaurant and were not disappointed. The English from some of the wait staff could be better, but then we are not in Australia but Singapore so cannot complain. The food was reasonably priced at S$12 per plate, and tasted absolutely delicious. The only thing that concerned me was how the staff did not appear very happy. Owners were constantly watching them and I do not believe treated them very well. I think they need a lesson from Richard Branson who states that customers are not your first priority, your staff are. Look after your staff, and they look after your customers, which takes care of the profits. Have been to a few restaurants in Singapore this time and this was the saddest looking group of employees I have seen. Service was very good, food delicious, but when observing their staff, cannot rate then higher than very good. Am tempted to rate them as average, but this would be an injustice to the quality of the food
