Went there to celebrate son‚Äôs birthday and didn‚Äôt expect too much. Ordered 3 rib-I, one came out steak only slightly warm n carrots were cold while the other 2 were ok. Pizza was nice. Service generally ok.
5
Cute display of dishes. Be ready to take lots of photos there.....We had a friendly and lovely waitress.
5
This is a perfect place for Gudetama and Japanese Culture fans, the food tastes good and looks very amusing. Perfect for kids and adults alike.
4
Super cute, family friendly and Instagram friendly cafe. the food was expensive, though it is to be expected.
5
i will come back again. Cheft is best cook by here and taste is excellence. Next time i will come back again.
4
Innovative cafe and good food that exceeded our expectations. Come if you're a gudetama fan. Even if you're not, you may be converted cause everything is so cute.
4
I love the food there and the interior is really cute with gudetama theme but since the place is not that big, we have to wait for quite a long time to have the service :(
4
our party of 8 celebrated my eldest daughter's 17th birthday dinner here and we had a blast! Food was wonderful and the staff accommodated all our requests! They even brought out a nice backdrop for us to blow out the birthday candles!
3
I was attracted by the cartoon like atmosphere at first. Once I tasted the food, the verdict is 'it looks as good as it tasted'. Another place I'll visit again. However, the service staff was not sure of my reservation request. In the end, I got to use my persuasive tone to get the seats at the hut. I guess business seems so good that they probably won't going to make any improvements on their service
1
Went there because there wasn't a queue. After the visit, we now know why there wasn't a queue. Food was not hot, extremely expensive, kids' meal was spicy (why would anyone give spicy food to kids???). Service staff were slow, inattentive and not polite. Asked for bill and was impatiently given the palm-up "Wait" handsign. Had to go to the counter to pay myself since the bill didn't come.Don't bother unless you are a die-hard Gudetama fanatic and don't mind the bad food and service.
5
The food is nice and tasty we will come back to dine in here again the staff is friendly and kind hearted.
5
Nice dining place at convenient location near Convention centre, variety of food choices, kid-friendly environment. Friendly staffs.
Merchandise overpriced.
5
Desserts at Gudetama were great. I loved the restaurant decor and how the there was integrated into the design of the food.
3
Quite crowded and pricey but cute and good for children food not that worth it though so can consider drinks
4
Offered the booth seats as we booked in advance via Chope. Overall the food is above average, the service crews are friendly too. Highly recommended for family dining üëçüèº
4
Food suit me and the deco of the restaurant also very creative.
Maybe cab add in more choice especially desert and drink.
If able to adjust the price will be more better. Or maybe participate with any other promotion.

Ah, tables and chairs were clearly in disrepair, with cracks and discolouration on the tables and chairs, and some of them were unstable too! For any other restaurant this might not come to be an issue but it is meant to be a themed restaurant where the decor matters more than usual. Service wasn‚Äôt great - inattentive and slow, having to ask multiple times for water etc. Napkin was damp for some reason...Food was definitely overpriced and underwhelming. In fact one of the worst meals ever. The highlight of the meal was the ‚Äúshoyu ramen‚Äù, a chocolate based cake with earl grey jelly and hazelnut cream that was made to resemble a bowl of shoyu ramen. Other than the $20 odd price, it tasted absolutely horrible. The cake was indescribable and the hazlenut cream left this terrible oily taste in your mouth. Definitely does not go with earl grey jelly, the textures were all wrong!!! Anyway, will never come back here again, and recommend that you don‚Äôt, too!
3
Their Facebook page said that if we celebrate our birthday there, the staff would give us an "unforgettable experience". My group experienced slow service, forgotten requests and nothing special. The food looked really cute and tasted not bad. We can get better food and service for those prices elsewhere. This is a place to just go once for the fun and cute experience of eating Gudetama
4
Booked with Chope and was given a booth for 3 pax. Glad I made reservations as the queue was long on Christmas eve! I felt happy as soon as I stepped into the restaurant, the decor really brightens you up. Usually I don't have expectation on food for themed restaurant but Gudetama's food quality was not bad at all, and they were so cute to look at.It was a very busy day but the servers were trying to keep up with the orders, and doing their job with a smile.I will definitely make another trip down again
3
Overall food is okay but service need to be improve. Take long time for us to call the waitress for attention. Staffs are not initiative, they did not provide children dish plates and cups until we asked. The worse is, they did not provide us kids menu, we only knew that when we have finish our meals and end up our kids just ate egg, toast and waffles.
1
Dirty cutlery, service staff don‚Äôt bother to replace them after passing them the dirty cutlery, steak was stringy.
4
Instagram worthy cute restaurant. Food was quite big portion. Will return with kids too. I'm sure they will love it.
4
Great option for family and kids. Came here for coffee and waffles. Food is definitely on the pricier end but worth it if you are a big fan of gudetama!
3
Food is quite pricey but thankfully it taste not bad. Won‚Äôt really say its value for money but basically you are paying for the themed food. This is more of a one time visit just to experience kinda restaurant.
4
Went there for lunch, wasn't expecting much of the food due to various poor reviews of their main course. However, contrary to those reviews, the main courses we ordered were good.
4
Food taste ok, but the price rather expensive. Go there for an experience with gudetama, as it's the theme of the cafe.
4
Food was tasty and instagram worthy. Ramen dessert was very Creative and friends liked it very much. Will visit again
5
Had a good time exploring the cafe and enjoying the foods. I also took some kawaii photos. However, i think that The price is quite steep especially the marchandise.
1
visited on 17 Dec 2017. bad service from service crew all round. I was taking photo on my iPhone of the first main course on the table when the second dish arrived. The waitress saw that I was taking a photo and don't even bother to wait for me to take the snap first. She looked impatient and hurriedly place the dish on the table. She can't even wait three seconds for me to finish up a quick snap? Next, we did not order drinks and were also not served plain water. We saw that other tables were served plain water. So I tried to get the attention of a waiter who saw me but he was serving the table next to me. He nodded to acknowledge me but when he finished with that table, he did not come my way. I spent the next 5 mins trying to get the attention of the two waiters who looked busy and purposefully avoided eye contact with customers. We were already more than half way through the meal before we manage to get hold of a waitress to serve us water. We can't wait to finish up my meal quickly and leave.
5
It was my second time to treat my foreigner friends come with their family, even though not much option to choose, but looking at those kids√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ smiling face are quite worth it because you can take a chance to snap pictures with their Gudetama decorations and setting. Price and taste wise can be considered averag
5
The cafe is designed for a cartoon of an egg. Everything was so cute so we kept taking photos. They have the egg design perfectly. Can‚Äôt remember the food but had fun while it lasted !!
4
Super cute food but not worth the price for the ingredients used. Paying for the experience I guess!
4
We used the chope app and enjoyed good discounts
We loved the decor and the food presentation was so pretty . However , we hope the cafe can include more non spicy sausages and some cutlery need replacement
4
when i first stepped into the cafe, i was greeted with a warm smile and was treated like a king for the day.
4
Had the merry xmas platter and the food wad good. The pizza was also yummy and soft. Will be back again.
5
They have very creatively designed and decorated dishes especially their desserts. The serving for the main course is really huge.
4
It was a fun evening at Gudetama cafe..we loved the ambience as it was so fun with all decor of Gudetama...restaurant celebrates our birthday with a free cake and a headboard for photo taking.
4
Went there for a birthday celebration, on request of the birthday friend who‚Äôs a Gudetama fan. The cheesy sweet potato fries with beef is a starter you absolutely have to get. The amount of cheese is very generous, and it feels like you‚Äôre biting into a slice of pizza with each bite. The smoked salmon eggs benedict was yummy too, with very generous portions. Service-wise, upon being informed that it was our friend‚Äôs birthday, they brought out a huge Gudetama birthday sign and a complementary dessert plate with a little cake (: my only gripe about the cafe is that it is pretty pricey. Each Main costs about $24 and above, and their sweet drinks cost about $8.50, all before GST. So for 7 pax, the total bill came up to about $240 for approx. 5 mains, 3 starters and 5 (non-alcoholic) drinks.
4
You don't have to be a Gudetama fan to dine at this restaurant that serves good food with great service. But you'll probably be one after your visit as the restaurant put in every effort in the decor to create the ultimate Gudetama dining experience for their fans
5
Sitting in the restaurant with all the cute Gutedama items and deco, it makes one feel excited and hungry.It was my 2nd visit and the Nua breakfast always enticed me. It‚Äôs simply satisfying! And as part of the Chope Diners‚Äô Choice 2017 set menu, it‚Äôs definitely worth the money!
3
The food are very average and the cafe is under staff - with about 5 staffs serving the dinner crowd. But the food was serve relatively fast thou... nothing fantastic about the food, it just that they look cute.
3
Have been there for the kiddos. The decorative interior was pretty and fun loving, Good for theme parties for kids.
3
‚Ä¢ Staff very friendly and provide good service
‚Ä¢ the environment very cute and good to bring the kids for experience
‚Ä¢ Good Location, easy to find the place
3
Food was so so. Food presented in the pictures on the menu look nicer! The desserts was cute and probably good for young kids to wow at.
5
Food was actually not bad! Only drawback is that it is pricey. Staff was very friendly too and we all had a great time there
4
Love the room and food deco. Came during October 2017, and the halloween props were up. Food was mediocre, and abit pricy, but definitely insta-worthy. One of the best themed cafes I've been in Singapore and Malaysia.
5
Fun place and menu, esp for kids. Pretty yummy food too! The staff were v busy but still v accommodating, helpful and giving.
3
Food was overall ok but waiting time took forever despite not having a crowd. We were all starving. There were free hardboiled eggs but our dishes all had eggs - so we didnt want it. Seems like the eggs had been there for a long time too (not fresh).
3
This place is a great tourist trap. Or for those familiar with Sanrio and Gudetama. You're gonna want to go just based off that. I know I did. When you arrive into the mall and are outside the restaurant you're greeted with the character - everywhere and on everything. lol (Not joking, the napkins, the water bottle, etc.). There are great choices fro seating and each are slightly themed too. You can sit on an egg! The service and the food were great. Drink the Hula Hula, it's smokin'! lol - no alcohol! Just remember to bring plenty of cash - it's not the cheapest. Although, the food is tasty, just remember that it ain't cheap. Some dishes start at S$19, burgers and larger sets are above S$23. That doesn't even include a drink. My drink, the Hula Hula, was a reasonable S$8, which was okay since it did have special feature. If you're in it for a special treat then make it your stop, it's worth it. And the food is good. Not healthy but still very yummy
3
My children loves it. The restaurant deco was great. Too bad we didn't know about the booth and did not get to sit in it. Every serving of food came with the egg character, which makes it soooo appetising. Find the price a little too high. Guess we have to pay for all these deco.Great place for photo taking
4
Have visited the restaurant several times and the display of food is really cute. However cleanliness and service could be improved
4
My usual impression of themed cafes..nice looking mediocre-tasting food. However, at Gudetama, the food taste great, though slightly pricey but all in all, the experience was great!
4
We ordered their lobster with dry noodle (seasonal special menu), egg Benedict (signature dish) and ramen (signature dessert). Food portion is good, suitable for sharing. Taste is good and I love their food presentation. Strongly recommend their Ramen dessert.
4
It's all about the details in this restaurant that created a great overall dining experience! No details were spared to make sure one feels truly Gudetama!
5
The food overall was good. Only set back was the kids menu. We order a rice bento for my kids to share, taste of the Spanish rice really don't suits kids. End up went to waste.
3
both atmosphere and food were good. they would not chase customer away if it was about to close. Just that service was not that good as in difficult to find waiter.
4
Went for first time although passed by many times. Thrilled with the presentation esp with my Son around.
4
The setting is suitable for family and friends gathering. Food presentation is nice and tasty. Service is prompt.
1
we went there at our stated reservation time. the waiter told us to wait and she didnt get back to us at all, she only appeared to be clearing the tables. very poor service, and we had reserved for 4 children and 5 adults table, the tables they got for us at the start, was cramped and small. Never going back again and it's definitely an overhyped cafe
2
Food was pretty good. Service was poor. They seemed to be shorthanded when I patronized their shop on Sunday afternoon Oct 1. I had to take a while trying to get the attention of their staff when I needed to order my food and to get the bill. The bill took 20mins to come, because they forgot about it till I reminded them again. Seriously, I reluctantly paid for the service charge
4
Dine in just for the theme & cute designs. Food is average and the infused tea is so bland.
Quiet atmosphere as my table was at the other side of restaurant.
5
If you are a Gudetama or a Sanrio fan, this is a picture worthy place to be. Food is good and cutely presented.
4
A very good environment for dining.. Good decoration. Just nice portion. Good service with chope 10% voucher üëçüèª
4
Food was aesthetic; more pleasing and feasting to the eyes than actual taste and palate. But overall the outlet is still very nice and will melt the very hearts of Gudetama fans!
3
not very clean, bowels were still wet when provided to us. table was bit oiled too.there was not much service at all although service charge was debited straight away
4
The cafe ia super adorable filled with lots of Gudetama stuff like egg-shell chairs, waffles like ceiling decoration, Gudetama serviettes etc. Everything is so cute!!!!! Service was efficient too, food were also served not long after ordering! Taste-wise, they had exceeded our expectation as we didn't have much anticipation for character cafes. However, the food here were great! We ordered, Sataylicious burger, Chicky, Sun-tanning pizza and chicken+waffles with their strawberry and mango drinks. ^^ Definitely worth a visit to explore this cute cafe
4
Not sure if the staff are channelling Gudetama, but the service was terrible. We waited ages for the order to be taken, food took a while and then to get the bill... We had to wave many times. And the cafe was empty.We loved the setting as we are Gudetama fans and he is everywhere. We both ordered from the SGD23 menu of local items - I had crispy chicken and partner had satay. The dishes were fun with egg faces and tasty. But for Singapore this is expensive...We enjoyed our time at the cafe, but only come here if you love Gudetama! Once was enough for us.PLEASE PLEASE - get the staff to improve. And so cheeky to collect 10% service charge when there was NO SERVICE
3
Went to Gudetama Cafe for brunch with friends on last sunday. The environment was cute and sweet. The food looks very cute !! everything is instagramable. However the food is overpriced and food quality was not as good as standard cafe brunch and the soft toy on the seats are all dirty. Suitable for people who likes to explore new and fun dinning place
4
The food & desserts were so cute, so was the decor of the cafe! There was Gudetama photo opportunities all around! (Tables, chairs, booths, even the ceiling was one adorable Gudetama sunny side up..) Savories were overall tasty (for a character cafe, I held my expectations low), albeit pricey. The truffles fries were quite crispy, & we all loved the garlic aioli sauce. The dessert ‚ÄúShoyu Ramen‚Äù was very creative, but too sweet for us to even finish. Service was good, though hard to get someone‚Äôs attention when it‚Äôs full house
3
After being nagged by my grandkids for a few weeks, we finally stepped into Gudetama Cafe today. First impression was great - crowd, deco and warmth welcome. The menu was well presented and we ordered the following:MAINSRib-‚ÄúI‚Äù Don‚Äôt Care ‚ÄúAre You Busy‚Äù BurgerBig "nua" BreakfastSIDETruffle Fries in a coneDRINKSChocoNaNaHula HulaFood presentation was exciting and we took our time to savour and share the generous portions. We struggled to finish the servings and ended up doggy-bagging the Truffle Fries, forgoing and resisting the temptation of the desserts. Overall, I find the cuisine is no different from any other western food except for its eggciting twist.
4
Service was abit slow but food was good as usual!! Try the desserts!! It's a unique concept and it's yummy!!
3
When it first opened in Singapore, we decided not to queue. Just went recently, we spent $80 for 3 dishes. Wasn't worth the hype or perhaps we had too high expectations..
5
Nice place to celebrate birthday and gathering. This is the 2nd times celebrated of friends birthday at Gudetama Ôºåthanks for the free cake ÔºÅ
4
Chicken and waffles with a gudetama egg were tasty but expensive. The novelty of the cafe interior and food just about justifies the price!
3
If you are there for the ambience and characters- then this is the place. Dun expect very good service or food. Expensive and everything round out.
4
my family enjoyed the experience and we were pleasantly surprised that a theme restaurant can serve such good quality food.
1
Food doesnt come on time! My gf's pork rib only arrive after i ate half of my steak. Food isnt fantastic. The bill took more than 5 minutes to pay. I wouldnt recommend this to others.
5
Great place to bring your kids. Service & food are nice.. Would be better if the area is bigger. Will visit again.
3
Food Not Worth for the price.Not much food to eat and need to think for quite some time before ordering of food.
3
Go the the cafe, 80% for the whole Gudetama experience and leave 20% for the food. My friend and I didn't enjoy the lobster onsen (bisque) - it was mostly bitter. The pork ribs priced at $38 really isn't worth and I'll minus more points because there wasn't any Gudetama deco on the dish! :( Food aside, I really loved the deco of the place. We were sitting on eggshells! Haha. Even the base of our cup for water had Gudetama printed on. Very nice set up :) The table next to us had a birthday, complete with Gudetama photo props, etc.
3
Food varieties was not enough and the food prices are too expensive. A place for the families with kids to enjoy
5
Gudetama is a cartoon character, apparently. He is an egg yolk, so my daughter told me. The food was delicious. The presentation imaginative. The decore wacky and fun. The price was slightly higher than usual, but still the entertainment value was excellent.
4
Presentation is not bad but food is really average. Not up to my expectation. Service is also so so as well
4
Had the all day breakfast, bacon and sausage were nicely done, non spicy sausage would be perfect though. Very generous portion too!
5
Food was alright, huge portion. Egg-cellent deco! Staff reserved the cute dome egg shell seats for us too :)
5
So happy to be given a booth seat when I made this reservation on Chope! The service crew was very attentive and offered us water, napkins and even photo-taking services. Can't ask for more. Food was decent too, but big portions were served and its better to share for small-eaters like me
4
The overall dining experience was excellent and food portion was generous enough to match the slightly marked-up price for typical caf√É¬© food. The team of young service crew was attentive but again, the lunch crowd was manageable and consist mainly of tourists. Food quality was above average which was a pleasant surprise for me. However, the items in the menu was limited and hopefully there will be more food items offer in the near future for my next possible visit
4
If you love Gudetama, you will love this cafe! You can find the lazy egg everywhere in the cafe.We visited the cafe for dinner on a weekday. It was less crowded but most tables are already taken. Do remember to reserve a table! The service was alright but our table was not cleaned properly.We ordered 2 mains and 1 drink. The portion of the food was pretty huge. The RIB-I don't care was alright for the price. Unfortunately, "Are you busy" burger wasn't so good. The beef patty was overcooked and it was really hard to chew. The strawberry soda was too expensive for the taste. Overall, the taste of the food is decent for a character cafe but some food are too expensive
2
I visited during 6pm on Tuesday. Super less crowded due to weekday. However that is 3 waiters and 1 manager or supervisor perhaps(wearing long black sleeve and pant) always gather at one side and chit chat. I seated at leather sofa seat, I sense some moldy smell over there. We have ordered one portion of "whole day breakfast" and "shoyu ramen" desserts. We do not order drink due to less having beverage with sweet taste. I wonder why never offer water when order was done and I saw they do prepare a lot jug of water and glass at side station; chargeable perhaps. However, the waiter do not upsell drink too when order. The food that we ordered quite delicious and the desserts make us feel wow,really look exactly same as Ramen. We are 2 pax but only ordered 1 main course and 1 desserts, I saw other tables that is come with side plate for stand by. Unfortunately our table without side plate and the waiter never notice although they got pass by few times; check are we done the dishes as they only aware to clear the plate immediately after we done. Overall, I'm only satisfied with the food quality =
4
Food took a little long to arrive. Service was great - although we had to ask for our drinks twice. I ordered the cajun chicken and waffle - loved it! Chicken was generously marinated and cooked well, and the combination of the waffle just made it a good mesh of flavours. I made sure to leave some waffle at the end so I could have it with the honey and cream as dessert. Killing 2 dishes with 1!We shared the truffle fries which smelled amazing and tasted awesome too. I would suggest not to have the sodas, it's a little overpriced and to be honest, not that fantastic - better off with just water
5
A wonderfully themed restaurant with moving animatons. Food is really interesting all in Gudetama themes.
2 thumbs up to a nice and cosy restaurant. Highly recommended to all.
4
Place was good for gatherings. Food wise was average for the price we are paying. Overall gd place for chillout and photo taking
5
The staff gave us an unexpectedly amazing surprise for my friend's birthday! They even gave a birthday cake complimentary :) appreciate the service!
4
One of the many theme restaurants that has popped up in Singapore. Food is pretty ok compared to some of its counterparts. Prices are on a higher side compared to a normal cafe. Guess we are paying extra for dining with Gutedama.
4
The service is good, but the service crew took awhile to notice that we need their attention. The food is not bad but one of the dish sold out before we could try it.
4
The chef's recommendation on eggs benedict salmon was spot on! Me and my girlfriend enjoyed the dish.
4
Prompt service. The staffs were attention and friendly despite the crowd. Nice atmosphere. Serving was big too.
5
excellent service, excellent food, cute gudetama design cafe. we just love the cafe. was celebrating my girl's 11th Birthday thanks to the staffs for the birthday song and helping us taking photos. As well as a complimentry cakes for my girl. Very thankful to all the staffs once again
4
I went around 12pm on a weekday and there was no line. (However, there was still a delay before I was seated. I later noticed that people who were had been waiting in line for a while received complimentary hard-boiled eggs.) I left around 1:30pm and there was a long line, so I suggest visiting in the morning for brunch or an early lunch. Since I went alone, I ordered only 2 dishes: the "I'm Cold" smoked salmon eggs benedict and the Gude pudding. The eggs benedict seemed to be of a bigger portion than other main dishes, big enough to share with someone else. It had a rich combination of flavors, with the avocado, fish roe, egg, and hollandaise sauce. The pudding had a sweet vanilla ice cream base, but the pudding itself left a bitter aftertaste. I liked the crunch that the apple crumble pieces added. Overall, the food is better than other character cafes I've visited. If not for the cute designs, it could easily pass for usual cafe fare. I highly recommend splitting dishes, as most appear large enough to share. Considering the decor, design, and quality of the food, the cafe is definitely worth a visit. Plus, they give complimentary Gudetama butter cookies after you pay the bill! (At least when I went.
4
Cute cafe with everything from wall deco down to the wet tissue boxes (yes! They provide wet tissue instead of tissue). U can buy merchandise straight from there as well. Kids would have a great time. Food was pretty decent too, just a tad bit pricy - 3 pax $90+ eating just mains, no starters no drinks
4
The service level of the restaurant provided by the manager and staff was excellent. A little pitu that the choices of food and beverage are limited. Overall experience was good.
3
Staff were polite. Waiting time for food was not long, but the food was not piping hot when arrived. All the dishes were presented well.
4
Might seem pricey but is because the servings are huge. Shared a burger with my Wife and was still full at the end. Service was also good. Worth a try!
4
Food was average, but looks cute. Sevice crew was attentive and polite. Tried the truffle fries which was good. So was the big breakfast and burger. Chicken waffles was abit cold.
4
Setting is very customers engaging; food turn cold very quickly (of cos the photo taking by dinners themselves play a huge part of it). Menu must be refreshed periodically to ensure repeat visits üëåüôèüèª
4
Nice food and you have to like eggs. The place is fun for instagrams. Reserve a table on weekends with the Chope mobile app as it will get crowded.
3
This is a place for kids where the deco & food really attract the them & nice place to take pictures. Not as appealing for the adults though. Food is average but on the high side.
1
We went in for a Sunday night dinner and since there wasn't a queue when we arrived, we randomly decided to have dinner there. Despite being the only ones standing at the entrance of the cafe, staff were strangely trying their best to ignore us by walking by quickly and avoiding eye contact. Unfortunately for them, my toddler, by now excited with the decor, drew their attention with her squeals of excitement. The manager motioned to one of his staff to show us to a table and she quite happily led us to a crowded section of the cafe and then happily brought us back the main entrance to show us to an empty table.The menu is made up of a limited range of dishes that each have a happy face printed on the egg of some sort. Nothing quite like what I expected, nothing with a fluffy Gudetama character where you poke a hole in it for the bean paste to ooze out from. Rather disappointing if you ask me. I couldn't help but think this was yet another tired attempt at copying ideas from overseas but failing in every way possible.We ordered one of those all day breakfasts since it was a relatively simple dish that's hard to mess up. We also ordered an Americano and a dish of eggs benedict. The food came in a heavy cast iron skillet but ironically, the food was cold. Nothing sizzling but we let that go 'cos we're quite immune to bad food and service after living here long enough. They also brought me a cuppacino instead of an Americano. I don't quite know how this happened. I can't comment for my dining partners food was but my all day breakfast was one of the worst I've had in a long while. Would I come back? Not the slightest chance. I'd recommend you to visit the branch overseas instead. Avoid this one at all cost
4
Food wise was not too bad and deco was super good.... if u wanna celebrate birthday there, purchase a cake from them and let them know your surprise and they will really surprise the birthday boy/girl. Service was really good and they will auto help you to take a photo with your friends. overall experience was a good one :)
4
Went with my boyfriend and 2 girlfriends to have dinner there. The food are really cute with the gudetana expression on it. And the taste is not bad too. We ordered the family platter at $68 to share among us. Portion is not too enough for 4 of us. We topped up $20 for 4 cooler drinks (mango & strawberry iced teas). I have to say that the price and charges for this cafe is really pricey. But just for a one time try, this is good
4
was there with overseas frds who love theme cafes, found the place photographable as we were early and cafe wasn't too pack. food and drink taste - edible and nothing too special. staff service was better than the previous time i was there
4
service staff quite attentive, food was good.. but the downside was the selection of the food was pretty limited..
5
Really like the decoration. Even the ceiling was decorated with gudetama theme! Kids meal is good value for money and comes with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream.
4
Cafe is cute! Price a little pricey and food taste average. But presentation of food is great! Overall worth a visit.
5
Excellently done deco. My son who loves gudetama loves it there. Food was nice too and served quickly. But menu lacks variety though.
4
Food was nice and nicely decorated. The restaurant deco was cute. But I felt out of place. My wife and I are close to 50 yo. And my kids are in Sec. 3 and P.5. We are a bit too old for that.
4
Love the bright and cheeeful deco. Food taste good and special mention of creative desserts which are worth ordering.
3
Met family for dinner here, not the sort of place we'd normally go too but I think the draw card was the cutesy aspect!Being one of those annoying vegetarian types, I found the selection very limiting and ended up having a kind of all day breakfast minus the bacon and sausage. Sadly, the no meat alternative was hash brown nuggets, not particularly imaginative. However, the staff were excellent and couldn't do enough to help, very friendly and chirpy, thank you Mark, my namesake!Decor was very cutesy and bright and was very clean.Before our meal we had a nice feed of hard boiled eggs that we're in a basket and included the little face stickers placed on the, nice shot of protein.Everyone in our group seemed more than happy and despite being a little on the pricey side, we're glad we visited
3
Love gudetama, had a zip up tote bag and gudetama themed polaroid film for a month long Asia trip.Came home via Singapore. Hadn't realised there was a cafe there till we'd arrived so got pretty excited! Cafe decor is expectedly cute. The food/drinks were pretty good actually. Was happy with them both taste and presentation wise. Price is on the higher side but it is a theme cafe and I don't really mind about the price so long as I have a good experience. Merchandise at counter is beyond over priced, can't imagine them to ever sell anything. We all know we can buy it online. Would have bought something for novelty/spontaneity sake if it wasn't all such a rip off. This was supposed to be short review! Anyway.Service left a bit to be desired. One guy there was real friendly at least, even if he didn't know what gudetama is and has never seen the show, or even realised there is a show.....Generally staff don't seem to know what Gudetama is, this is poor staff/business management in my opinion. It is not the fault of the staff. They have simply gotten a job in hospitality and the concept has really never occurred to them or they're not interested. Bit disappointing to enthusiasts to go somewhere 'designed and operated for enthusiasts' and have to explain to staff about the character. Particular side note and rude point of staff: our main waitress, who's name I do recall but shall leave out on account of her obvious efforts to rectify the situation when pulled up on it. We arrived not long after 9pm, they close at 10pm. Quickly ordered and food didn't take long. We were nearly finished eating by 9:35pm when the waitress came and rudely interrupted, asking could we pay now and being somewhat insistent. It was obvious we were nearly finished and we still had 25 mins before they closed. I wanted to pay at counter and get a piece of cake before leaving (of which I would need to do at counter as I hadn't looked and don't know what cakes they have). I said soooo do you want me to come to the counter now? No I can get the EFTPOS thing. But I want to look at cakes/merchandise. Should I stop eating and go do it now? Can't it wait? My husband becoming increasingly baffled and annoyed by the waitress, while watching my obvious distress and disappointment. Anyway it was all pretty awkward and rude and most importantly unnecessary. We were about to finish and pay and leave anyway. I felt very upset. We told her it felt like she was rushing us and wanted us to hurry up and go. I reminded her that while she may have zero interest in Gudetama and that I realise she probably goes there most days of the week, that she should remember that customers are most usually going to be fans and have never been before so are excited and her attitude is a real buzz kill. She was genuinely apologetic and left us to finish, which we then done extra quickly as we wanted to go. Hopefully she will take this experience forward with her as an opportunity to see her job/the cafe from another's perspective, this may revive her attitude towards her job and improve her own feelings of her job and other customers experience. I'm probably too idealistic of the impact of our conversation and polite honesty with her.So for something that we talked about doing for 2 or 3 days and factored into our itinerary it was all pretty lacklustre. I wouldn't go back. The chocolate peanut butter cake we took away was good.

Despite many poor reviews, my family decided to try this cute theme cafe. One of my daughter is gudetama fan. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table. We are ready to reject the "side dining place" if the main hall is not available. As the deco in the main hall is much better. As reviewed. services have been poor, our expectations also been warned. However to be fair to service staffs, they are very busy and trying to meet diners need. We got what we wanted - from warm, cold water to be replenished and extra set of plates/ cutleries for dessert to clearing our main meals plates. We ordered family set , food enough for family of four, cheese cake dessert. Food wise is not bad for a theme cafe , well designed and crafted. Prices of course is not cheap because of deco not only on place but food. Space is small , understanding the high rental in Singapore . Overall - satisfied and happy meal.

Location is good and near Esplanade MRT at Suntec City.
The food selection is limited and pricey. I would get better deal elsewhere.
The deco is appealing to kids but not me.
Unlikely to visit again.
4
The food here is absolutely pricey, taste is good anyway, their selling point is on the cuteness of food appearance which wr so instagram-able. Salad was nice, dessert pan s recommended

While the Gudetama-themed interior really looks appealing, and all the food is nicely presented with decent quality..the bad service ruins it all.I waited 10mins to get a seat, only to know that I was brought up to a separate section of the cafe with not-so-neat decor, and I was approaching the manager to ask for a better seat, "If there's any opening of the seat inside, please let me know..."And abruptly putting a stop without letting me finish my sentence. I mean, the zing that always make people keep coming back is the service. No matter how small the gesture is. Filipino Manager Jason, you have a lot of homework to do, including making your service team happy, because they are the front guard of your business!
3
Its the second time I visited this place. So far their food never disappoint me, compare to others theme cafe. Price was average pricey. Service wise, still have to improve. The first time when i visited this restaurant, I accepted the service level due to its still new and it was crowded with long queues. But after more than half a year, i came back to this place.. business has slow down by a bit, you dont really see long queues anymore. but still the service was not up to expectation We have to call for service for a few times only they will acknowledged us
3
If you're a fan of cute stuff, this is a place for you! The meals are really cute, all comes with gudetama. Food is pricey, taste of the food is also average. As for me, it's a one time meal just for the sake of taking a picture, and just to say been there done that.
3
I went here on 2 occasions. Tried their limited edition mentaiko pasta (excellent!), pizza (meh...but nice nonetheless), ribs (soft to debone and quite delicious) and chicken & waffles (so-so). The mocktail drinks were too diluted. Service is good but hard to catch their attention. I have to agree with other reviewers that given the quantity and quality of the food, the price is expensive but this is how all other themed-cafe works. Definitely not a place you would frequent, a once or twice experience would suffice. Aside from those factors though, you would come out happy given all the cuteness in store
3
Read some unfavourable review but still decided to give this place a try. We do not need to queue as we made a reservation. Service staff seems to be either tired, stress or clueless except few who are attentive. We had to take our own water as the staff were too slow. Food portion was good and taste not as bad as what was being reviewed and servicing speed was actually relatively fast. Generally an interesting place to see poor egg and price is on the high side, likely due to rental and franchise fee.
2
My wife really wanted to go here so we went to have a look. The place was clean and the theme was nice. I ordered the Ribs and they were like they just came from a microwave. They were dry and tough to eat, the vegetables were meh but the chips cooked well. When we went to pay and got the final bill we were shocked as we had been to many other places to eat and this was rediculous. I wouldn't go again and my wife said the same
4
Cuteness overdose is the word to use here. Every dish comes with the iconic eyes and mouth, while gudetama sits atop staring at you while you eat. Prices are on the high side for each dish. But quite worth it for the experience. Go with an open heart and you will enjoy it
2
Came here with high expectations but found the food to be so-so. It's 20% higher than what u would pay for similar restaurant in a shopping center but not as tastier. I was really disappointed that the staff were not attentive. They put us in the smaller room next to the main. Our table did not have the wet napkins n free eggs and only when we ask, they brought the eggs over without the napkin. Overall a disappointing experience but I guess everyone will go try once. So I don't expect this restaurant to last longer than 2 years. Well done not
3
This restaurant is very cute, cozy and instagram worthy. The food and beverages also cute but the taste is so so and a bit expensive.
They also sell gudetama merchandise which, in my opinion, is also pricey.
I am sorry but the service is poor.
3
Was there with my family for dinner. A cute cafe, a lovely cushion.
Taste : so so.
Price : its pricey i think.
4
Very cute gudetama theme cafe
Someone said the taste of this cafe is bad, but for me the taste is okay with little bit pricey, the portion is big can share up to 2 people
3
It's a restaurant where you can take some nice photos with Gudetama decor everywhere. Food is average so it is not a place which we would want to come often or even a second time.
2
Leaves a lot to be expected but quantity is ok. If you're dining here with kids, the "stickers" look cute but these aren't hand drawn. Prices are pretty high for the quality of food. We had lobster bisque and breakfast. The lobster bisque was already quite little and served in a bread bowl that was leaking. Flavour was ok for the bisque but accompanying greens was quite heavy in sesame oil. Lacks balance in flavour. Greens weren't properly cleaned either with stalks that had the roots still on. Breakfast set had bacon that was crisp and not overly salty and the rest isn't really much to mention. 2 dishes at SGD$50 is a wee bit too pricey and puts it into realm of higher expectation where presentation and flavours was lacking. The hard boiled eggs served at each table was done just right. Had to have 2 just to be sure of consistency. Yolk was moist enough but totally cooked through. Service was lacking though, server mentioned bringing plates for sharing but those didn't materialise. Good for a novelty dine in just for the kids but not worth a foodie visit
4
Came here with friends to try out the food as it was too cute to miss. We are a table of 4 adults and ordered 04 Main course plus sides and dessert. Food was much better than any of the city theme Cafe I had been to. Services were prompt too. Food was in the expensive side but like I had mentioned, it was good. Presentation of dishes were Instagram worthy. Services from Richard, Ana and Renee are superb and patient. My apologies for this long overdue review. Will be coming again for my eggs craving
1
Very very very bad! If you like a cold food (but not ice cream) yeah this is the place.. and of course the cuteness does not cut the bad service. 3PM is not a busy time! But see my picture.. i got my cold steak but not my wife ramen! Yeah only ramen! Steak is ok.. cold vegie and you cannot change the potato to fries apperantly! So.. yeah.. cute but i am hungry too uou know! I AM STILL HERE BUT NO FOOD!! I will surprise myself if come back again!
4
Nice place! Cute lots of pics to take.. but food was so priceyyyy and food takes Long time to serve Try the moo friess! Sweet potato fries with beef and cheese! Love it.. it was spacious Nor squeeze but would be better if they could have a chair to put our bags cos seats are pretty small.. overall good experience only to experience for 1 time hah

The cafe took over the space formerly occupied by House of Robert Timms. The restaurant had 2 dining area : the main one with the items display for sale and a smaller one in garden theme. As we were early and there was not much customers around, only the main dining area was opened. We had our choice of seat and decided on one of the egg shaped booth table. If you were in a big group, there was a table shaped like a egg tray with eggs in it. So cute."I'm Cold" Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($26.90++)Poached eggs covered with smoked salmon. Drizzled with signature zesty hollandise sauce complete with mashed avocado, ebiko and tater tots.The dish was served in a rather heavy frying pan. It was so cute having the eggs covered with the salmon slices. Looked rather cosy. The simple looking dish was not bad and quite filling too. One could barely finished it.Shoyu Ramen ($21.50++)Shoyu Ramen made with chocolate cake, chestnut Mont Blanc and Earl Grey Jelly.Served with a side of panna cotta and sweetened rose tea.The dish looked very nice. While the cake was moist, hidden under the layer of jelly, one could not taste the chestnut in it. The panna cotta was creamy. The rose tea was lightly flavoured, that the flavour was not distinct. Finished the meal with Butterscotch Latte ($6.90++) and Matcha Latte ($6.90++) which both tasted rather average.As it was Easter weekend, there was free boiled eggs on the table to help oneself to

I knew the one in Japan and I was surprised to find this place ran that badly for the high standards they have in Japan ... I had to queue 45 mins to be seated ,,, then once seated 20mins to take the order .. and mostly because my friend was upset .. we ordered our bfast, my friends had her bkfast after 30 mins and she had time to finish her food before my eggs Benedicts arrived .. 60 mins .. !!! no one paid attention to the service .. you have hundred staff walking around but no one is paying attention to the service ... so bad for GUDETAMA.. no more for me here ...
3
In Suntec Center, looks good but some weird food. Had "their idea" of Eggs Benedict: cold, weird sauce just not even close. Service was really slow. Drinks at end of service after bugging them. Just not worth it.

Love the interior design of this cafe and the food looks si cute and surprisingly tasted really good ‚ù§Ô∏è

Portion is huge.
Total 4 ladies with two mains and one side. I had tea and rest of my friends on other beverages.
Novelty dining experience.
Theme cafe.
Nice to celebrate birthday here.
Food is nice and also expensive :)
Staff service is great!

Gudetama Cafe is an egg themed food stall. I love its bright and cheerful ambiance that's why I chose to have my lunch here. I did check the menu before I entered and noticed that the menu is limited and mostly it caters to kids meal. I ordered fish fillet and later realized it was too greasy for me. Nevertheless, I had nice pictures though. I won't recommend this restaurant if you are on a budget and looking for a hearty adult meal.
2
To be sincere, I am a huge fan of Gudetama. My boyfriend decided to come here while we were in SG. Thing is, the place is snap worthy. It's like a Gudetama dream. The menu has its variety of selections but it's quite pricey. We ordered a steak meal and soup. Service wise was average. The staff was responsive, but because the place was packed, we understood that they were tired and simply accommodated us because we called their attention. The food wasn't that great. I do think there are better places to eat, and get your meals' worth for only a fourth of the price. Presentation wise, it's great. The food can satisfy your Instagram needs. Stomach wise, we were full; but the steak wasn't even medium rare when we requested it to be, and the soup was really salty. The side salad wasn't bad though. I suggest people should come here on full stomachs and have some dessert or coffee instead. Hopefully in time, the cafe can offer a better experience for future first time diners. We appreciated the free cookies at the end though.

I was pleasantly surprised with the flavour and taste. Had lobster bisque that had egg in it and came with a salad. The truffle fries cost about $16 but sufficient for 4 to try. The menu card and the ambience are instagram worthy. The dessert is also very tasty and light - we had strawberry cake and macaroons.
2
I'd rate the food good enough but service & execution could do with a lot of improvement - the bane of service at f&b outlets in S'pore. Tried the salad with chicken & it was enjoyable.Most likely not dine there again as there are many offerings out there around similar standard.

Gudetama is a Sanrio character introduced back in 2013. This lifeless and low energy egg character or tamago as what it is called in Japanese gained quite a popularity particularly not just in local Japan but overseas as well and just like the mother brand, having their own Sanrio cafe, Gudetama has jumped out of the screen and has it's own cafe branching out in Singapore. The location is quite accessible as it is in the downtown core of Singapore in Suntec city. The outlet itself has an egg theme in their facilities as well as aesthetic design giving the overall whimsical theme. The food and drinks are quite a treat, not only does it look visually appealing and Instagram worthy, it tastes really good, my friend and I tasted their big breakfast, the eggs benedict with salmon, coffee and a specialty coffee drink and it has the Gudetama character added in each of the plate and drink and it made me hesitate for a second not to take a bite despite the food's aroma teasing my palate. They also have an assortment of desserts that has the same theme in each one. The service time needs to have a bit of improvement as it took a bit of time to get noticed when needing assistance but overall, this was a good culinary treat for me, definitely would be back to try the other dishes I missed out on
2
this was the most expensive restaurant we visited in singapore , food was ok but not worth the price. the place was very crowded and food took 45 min to arrive. the thing is they are very disorganized and what made me furious: people that just arrived being served first the same thing that I ordered !! I dont recommend it. Not worth the wait, price and struggle
3
Here's an interesting restaurant probably created by someone who ate too many eggs and is enjoying a little of a trip.Food presentation is great, but the decoration makes you feel like you are entering a kids birthday party. Weird to say the least.Food is ok. Tasty and junk-ish. Prices are ok. Even for Singapore standards.Drinks are pure sugar.Fun place, but not for me
5
Good family restaurant but option is limited, service is good but option is really limited. Need to introduce more food option.

Them restaurant based on cartoon character....basically normal food decorated with caricature of the character
As it's a themed restaurant the prices is expensive but the food is quite good.
It's an experience if you haven't been....but I wouldn't go again just for the food...

We were initially attracted because there was a queue to get in, and there was a promise of an eggs benedict breakfast. From then on, it only got worse.The restaurant is a cutesy Japanese-themed eatery, based around a character of some sort in a Japanese computer game known as Gudetama, or "lazy egg". Adding to the cutesy factor is that they somehow print an unhappy-looking visage on each egg.Our waiter got the table numbers all confused on everyone's orders, so we were constantly being sent the wrong drinks and the wrong meals. We were advised there was up to a 40-minute wait, but we were OK with that since this place was so popular.When our breakfasts were finally delivered, the eggs benedicts were a disappointment. The eggs are served cold, wrapped in salmon. Unfortunately we didn't notice this small detail when we were reading the menu. My husband's salmon was fine but mine didn't quite taste right for some reason. Neither of us could stomach the cold eggs and we left most of the meals uneaten.When it came time to pay and leave, there was another debacle due to the mix-up with the table numbering. My husband made a complaint to the manager on duty about the poor service but was met with indifference, and he just blamed their computer system.For the three of us the bill came to $108.75, by far the most expensive breakfast we've had in quite a while. All you are paying for here is the cutesy d√É¬©cor, almost inedible pseudo-trendy food, and poor service. On a positive note though, the place was very clean.We have no intention to return

We had a chance to finally try this cafe last month with our friends --out of curiosity. The place is cute and 'instagrammable'. However, despite of all the raves and long queues, you will find yourself looking for more choices since they really don't offer much options. And also, to be honest, don't expect so much with their food, they're a bit expensive for the quality. You are actually paying for cuteness and presentation. I guess if you just want to add #foodporn on your ig account and you are willing to pay 20-30 sgd for a dish, this is worth trying
4
Long queues during dinner time (even till past 8pm) - arrived at around 6.30pm and there were 14 people in the queue.The decor was really adorable and there were gudetama props to take photos with outside the cafe. Food was expensive but expected of a themed cafe. The food however was above average and the gudetama designs on the food were really cute!Would go back again to celebrate special occasions for friends who like the character. Worth trying once for gudetama fans
2
Really really nice ambience but..Food was cold, bland and tasteless. I just find that there's limited variety and overpriced! This will probably be my first and last time here.While waiting for friend to reach, there's 2 groups of patrons came and leave without ordering.Cheers,Jazly

Came here to celebrate our friends birthday, well here is what we thought:Ambience: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Customer Service: 1/5Quality of Food: 3/5Value for Money: 1/5Our Orders: Busy Burger: 3.5/5Ribeye Steak: 3/5Cajun Chicken: 2/5The Good: We thought the food could have been better, thought the ambience is incredible, and quite clean.The Bad: Customer Service.. The birthday party became quite appalling because of the way the cake was presented to us.. we could not eat the cake we purchased and had to move the birthday party outside of the restaurant.. waited 1 hr 45 mins for the table next to us to be cleared from guests who are no longer ordering.. Bottom Line: Come here for the novelty effect, but otherwise, manage expectations..

Finally tried out this place after the school holidays, when the teenage crowd has died down and the queues ceased to exist.I have heard of reviews and experienced such themed cafes serving bad food, albeit nice-looking dishes.But the food here was actually pretty good, and the serving portions were just nice... at least, for a lady. We had one guy in our company, and he was the only one who felt that he wasn't quite satisfied after his food. But everyone agreed the food was good, though prices are certainly steep.The only issue I have with them is the service. Not downright bad service, but I didn't like 2 things:One, they don't allow takeaways. Well, one of our friends was held up at a prior appointment, and since it seemed she was going to be really late afterall, plus we had already ordered for her, we thought we could just takeaway her food and scoot. But we were told they don't do takeaways. The manager did offer a cakebox, which is all they had, but how do you put waffles and chicken with sauce into a cake box? In the end, we just had to wait for our friend to arrive.Two, one of our friends was also pregnant, though not quite showing yet. When we asked for the eggs to be well-done, we were informed very matter-of-factly that they do not allow for such requests, unless the customer is pregnant. The way I see it, if you can make the eggs well done for a pregnant lady, it means you CAN do it, period. Why be such a snob and say you can do it ONLY if someone's pregnant? On top of that, since you can inform us of that "requirement" so matter-of-factly, at least be professional enough to NOT look so cynical, then give the lady a critical once-over, when we tell you that yes, our friend here IS pregnant. Do we need to show you the latest scan of the foetus to prove it? I get that she's not quite showing the baby bump yet, but that critical once-over look is just plain rude.Other than some of the not-so-polite staff and the snobby policies of this place, the food is still good, so I'll say that one can go for a special occasion. I wouldn't go again otherwise though

Food is not bad for a themed cafe. However the service was really bad, not all of the staff but the few that served our table. We came here for a birthday celebration, of course we hoped that the celebration will go smoothly with the help of the staff. When we asked the staff to help clear the table before serving the cake/deserts. However they just cleared two plates(we came as a group of 6), and left the cakes/desserts and pass the lighter to one of us and walked off. When we tried to get the attention of that staff that served the dessert to ask to clear our table, she just walked off in a rush. Then we tried our luck with other staff. With the amount of staff they have there I'm surprise that it took some time for us to catch the attention of anyone of them. Most of them were standing that the corner chit chatting. Finally One of them came up to help to clear our table, of course she took sometime because their were too many plates. The other staffs continue standing a the corner looking at her clearing the whole table by herself. Then we tried to ask a staff to take a photo for us. Most of them were chatting away. Finally when I caught the attention of one of them, she looked at me then turned around to arrange the cutlery. I'm surprise with attitude of the staff there. I think the management sound really look into this and train your staff better. I have to say I'm not referring to all of them, but at least 4-5 of them had the 'bo-chap' attitude, which I'm not sure if they were hired because their attitude matches the theme of the cafe

you'll love this place if you're a gudetama fan. there was a queue to dine in so we decided to get a baked treat to takeaway. we had a look at the menu and it's quite expensive. I had a citrus tart which was tasty and very cute.
