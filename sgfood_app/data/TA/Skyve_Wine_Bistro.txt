Food taste deserves 4 stars, but most of items come in extremely tiny portions. Services are from excellent (namely from the gentlemen managers) to super poor (e.g. one tomboy waitress tried to push wrong dessert orders to us). Ambience: nice after renovation, unfortunately, it turned rowdy due to a table with screaming child/ children.Hesitating to come back again
4
they recently revamped the menu and glad that its now much more affordable, had a great meal at 50 per pa

Friendly staff who consistently make you feel comfortable and at home at Skyve. They also make it a point to understand your preferences and share their recommendations that will help you enjoy the meal to the fullest. This makes all the difference. You get to enjoy great food while hanging out with friends. The new menu was definitely a pleasant surprise- with some new Chinese flavours included. I had the Lobster crispy noodles during my recent visit. Not only did I fall in love with how the dish was presented (see photo) but the flavour definitely was on point as if I was at a fine dining Chinese restaurant! :) So overall, a cosy dining setting perfect for that weekend brunch or that much needed chill out dinner place with friends /with your date.

As we continue to celebrate my 62 st birthday we went to Skyve. The surroundings are surprising but once inside you feel warm and welcome. As the manager told us, since February they have a new menu and the kitchen still has some problems with the logistics. We were a party of 3 and had three courses and none of them came tot the table a the same time. And although tasty the portions were relatively small for a normal grown up. They have still a lot to learn but with the passion for food and the friendly service most certainly worth to go back after a while and check how far they have come at that time
2
Went there on a Saturday night with a group of 10 friends for dinner and to chill out & chat. But shortly after we sat down, we knew we were in the wrong place...the acoustics were so very bad! We were seated in a row of long tables, 4 on either side and 1 on the two ends...And we could hardly hear the person sitting just across us due to echoes bouncing all around the glass windows & acrylic partitions!!Now the food...no complaints as far as taste, freshness & presentation were concerned but the portions were eeny-minnie itsy-bitsy! See photo of the smoked duck main course I ordered- it was a case of "Half a plate is better than none
5
The new brunch menu is quite friendly but I prefer the previous menu, where it offers nice sumptuous big lunch and truffle fries! I like the bright atmosphere during day time for brunch and perfectly romantic ambiance at night. Look forward to another wine and dine for dinner at Skyv
4
It was my 2nd time here. The food was still good, staff were very prompt to our request. Overall, great restaurant for couples time as the atomsphere was great
5
I really love the ambience. The mains were good, especially the beef and oysters. The desserts (I got the platter) paled in comparison. But I will definitely visit the place again
5
food was good, wine was good and ambience is superb :) Will be back definitely! Although the place is abit hard to get to though
2
Charming external settings nestled among the greenery. Upon entry, it turns out to be a canteen-like environment with hard surfaces & loud sounds from everyone & everything. Kitchen did amazing with the quality & taste of food, with pricing to match. Service crew at our table is either new who don’t know their wine offerings or obnoxious in response to our service request to even suggest we shouldn’t eat there. That episode spoiled our celebratory plans & I would struggle to go back again after such an experience
3
The ambience is classy but cozy, and the waiters are also very attentive. The brunch is not that amazing, maybe the other food would be better.
5
The food is awesome and of premium quality. We had the Manhattan chowder, fresh oysters, beef burger with truffle fries, duck confit and hibachi pork. For dessert we had the key lime semifreddo.The staff were helpful, polite, attentive and full of smiles. A pleasant experience indeed! :
4
You can never go wrong with this place. Lovely and tranquail atmosphere makes you feel like you are not in Singapore. Good food and even better desserts!
4
This was our third time at the restaurant, however, it was our first time trying out the mains. We had the spaghetti and grilled pork which both tasted great. The restaurant also had a wide variety of wine for us to chose from. The service provided there was also great, with friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely be back
4
Really nice place for dinner. I had the sous vide tenderloin. Nicely charred, bacon wrap was very evenly cooked as well. We also had the aglio y olio with the lobster. Really BIG portion of pasta - equally generous chili flake. Too hot. Just. To. Hot. Lobster was nice. Onion rolls were a big hit
5
Our family had the chicken, pork, lamb and beef burger from the main menu. Food was good. The service was good and the live music was a bonus.
4
Glad to have had the opportunity to visit, interesting menu food was excellent, I found a wine that was excellent so much so went for a second bottle....you promote yourselves as a Wine Bar ....please don't loose sight of the fact a full cellar is appealing ....when the cupboard is bare it sends the penny pinching messag
5
Excellent restaurant with a great menu and cool concept. Fillet steak was cooked to perfection and chowder appetiser was very tasty. Service was impeccable and loved the theme/decor of the place.
5
Good and fresh seafood as well as the beef. Wide selection of wine choice. Friendly service. A complimentary Birthday dessert too! Cosy ambience
5
Food was great as well as the service and ambience for both indoor and outdoor. Will definitely go back again
4
Hosted my team's xmas dinner. the cod, pork and lamb was awesome. Did not quite like the burgers or the steak. For the steak, the mushroom sauce was quite lumpy which was not a great texture. For the burgers, it was not well seasoned
5
The food was good, the service by the staff was excellent. They helped out with all that needed to be done and assisted with whatever queries and worries I had. They settled my nerves for the event. A big thank you to the staff.
4
The food quality and ambience is good. The music is nice and not too loud hence allowing us to chit chat easily. Location is a bit inconvenient if u do not drive. The pork chop that I ordered seems too fatty for me. But otherwise, the rest of the food is good
4
~driving into Winstedt Road lookout for the carpark on the left, Skyve can be seen from the roadside near the fence, pls make sure you slot in the cash card ~parking is limited so do arrive early~Skyve is off the beaten path of everywhere so if you want privacy here's a good place~service is excellen
5
Amazing restaurant that my family and i love. The service and quality of food is exceptional, prices are above average but definitely worth every penny. i've been patronising skyve for many years and will continue to do so.
5
After looking at multiple locations to select for our lunch solemnization, we decided upon Skyve as it managed to fulfill our criteria of being cozy, have a nice ambience and affordable. And yes it was one of our wisest choice as the event was well executed with attentive staff and the most delicious food. All my guests are tremendously impressed and are full of praises. The owner and restaurant manager are also very accommodating to our requests which made the event even more meaningful. We would highly recommend anyone considering Skyve as an event location.
5
love the service rendered and the ambienceif you are looking for a good place to wind down, think of Sky-ving
5
Manhattan chowder was best iv tried. Creamy n tasty. Pork w risotto was full of flavour. Smoked chicken has a fragrant smokey taste. Good stuff!! Would b back for more. A bit pricy for a bistro though
5
Service was super prompt, food was good. Recommended for special occasions especially :) quiet place tucked in newton :
5
Glad Skyve is opened at 10am on weekends and is the perfect spot to hangout while the children attend dance classes.Very nice decor and excellent breakfast menu
3
surprised to me that only another 2 tables are occupied. not very happening. food is okay but not a cheap place for the food and atmospher
4
Had dinner in Skyve. Service was prompt and food was served very quickly. Even had a complimentary desert! Nice place for couples as well as gathering for friends
5
We never realized that there's a nice and cozy place to listen easy listening jazz sounding live music around Newton until we went there once on Saturday night. It's walking distance from Newton MRT (walk throu the Newton Circus Food Court). The ambience (family-kids friendly), the food (are good) and the music blended perfectly; it's just the restroom could be a bit brighter and airy. (air difusser maybe?
4
There was some event going that day. So overall ambiance is affected. If not generally its a great place.
4
To be honest, we chose this place because I couldn't find a reservation on Saturday even for a bunch of other places we usually go to. I read some good reviews and found out it was just down the road so decided to go there. The taxi driver questioned our destination because it looks like you are being dropped off at an office block rather than a dining venue but don't let that put you off. Eventually found Skyve Wine Bistro at the back of the office block with its modern decor and enchanting lightning. They had a wedding group that day so could only offer us a place outside which was fine by us. We were first impressed by the service - the two guys that looked after us were really attentive and knowledgable. I had the Hokkien scallops which delicious but not as good as the Hibachi Pork! My wife loved here lamb and the vegetarian at the table said she was happy with the vego options. Wine selection wasn't as extensive as I would expect from a place that calls itself a wine bistro and we were served a Pinot Gris rather than the Rieseling I asked for but that was the only negative. We will be going back and might even try it for brunch as the brunch menu looked good
5
Skyve is always my go-to for a familiar treat. Duck confit is their signature. Desserts are passable.
4
We experienced Skyve in Singapore via Deliveroo. The main premise of this process is that we needed gluten free food, but didn’t want to leave the hotel that evening, so this seemed like the best solution. We came across Skyve because our search was specifically for gluten free and this appeared to be the only restaurant that offered this service. Whilst not extensive, the range did cover a number of dishes and we chose a dish that was essentially chicken with chips. The process was easy and the food arrived promptly. The chicken was served as a half chicken portion which was tasty and retained its moisture well. The chips were nice but in all honesty did not really travel that well and were only really luke warm at best when they arrived. The mushrooms were tasty and the accompanying sauce also salvaged the limp chips. We paid around £20 for this meal and it did fulfil its obligations. Did we feel like we got value for money? Perhaps not, as if we were both eating on this evening we would have spent the best part of £50 on a dining experience that did not include a restaurant, however this was Singapore and with that in mind and the general quality of the food on offer this experience does get 4/5
4
This is my 3rd visit to the restaurant and it's been the best dining experience there among the 3 visits.My family of 4 went to celebrate my 14-year-old son's birthday. Place was quiet, ambience was great and staff service was excellent. The staff service was just average during my last 2 visits.At my request, a slice of birthday cake was a pleasant surprise for the birthday boy. Food was pretty delectable though rather pricey. On the whole, it was a great evening for my family
5
Their sous vide dishes are always a treat on the tastebuds, using quality meat. The desserts are also very well put together flavours and excellent plating
4
Nice ambience, managed to get a quiet area for our lunch meeting. Staffs are courteous, food is not bad. Location is slightly out of the way though, will require someone to drop me off otherwise parking is an issue. Highly likely to come back again if I were around the are
4
It was my 2nd time visting the place. It's very quiet and the staff there are very nice. Difficult to find a place like this in Singapore especially during the weekend
4
Maybe we chose the wrong dishes, we order 3 pastas, 1 tortilla wrap and one french toast. The chili crab pasta was rather good, more spicy than the usual chili crab pasta and the french toast was good! But the other 2 pasta (seafood and prawn aglio olio) and wrap were only mediocre. However, the wait staff were attentive, constantly refilling our iced and warm water without having to request
3
Food was average although it cost as much as a restaurant with a better ambience. Unlikely to return
4
The kurobuta pork cheeks burger was an absolute winner, with its melt-in-the-mouth pork and toasted buns that were crispy and soft at the same time. When the staff learnt that we were at Skyve to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, they surprised her with a complimentary dessert. Thank you Skyve for a memorable lunch
4
We had lovely dinner at Skyve last night and I have forgotten how yummy the food is. Saketini oysters are divine. The cod done to perfection. Even the desserts are lovely ( we had tiramisu n key lime sorbet). But the place was not crowded on a Thurs night. Come on people. It's a nice little bistro. Staff were friendly, prices reasonable, I don't know why it's not buzzing.
5
Love this place! The team is very attentive and the food is good. Highly recommend the fries and wings. Super place for a hangout with friends or as a couple.
4
We visited Skyve for my wife's birthday whilst on holiday in Singapore. We chose it due to its location close to our hotel, otherwise it's a little out of the way. It's probably a five minute walk away from newton food centre, with not much else near it. The food and service however are amazing. The menu is extensive, and we both loved our starters and mains. My wife had a burger, and she maintains it's the best burger she's ever had. I had a smokeD duck salad to start which was out of this world. It also could have easily been a main given its size. The cocktails we had to accompany dinner were great too. Maybe not the cheapest place to eat but worth the walk from Newton MRT.
5
Beautifully lit up and the waitress were very attentive to customer's needs. Will definitely come back totry out the food. Ps: pet friendly
5
First time to this place. It's located in a seemingly abandoned building. Very cosy restaurant.Love the pork dish and it was cooked to almost perfect. Taste was great.Very worth it for the pric
5
Very helpful and friendly staff. The food was great especially the Sous Vide Hibachi Pork. The atmosphere there is really chill too! Would go back again :)
5
Skyve never disappoints. Always offering the best food and service. Had a couple of birthday celebration there and always receive a beautifully decorated dessert for the birthday star
5
great service and the food is fantastic too. the oyster with mentaiko is really fresh and tasty. the ambiance of the restaurant is nice and there's live band too.
5
Went to Skyve with a friend whilst visiting from UK. Oysters, duck and sous vide beef all exceptionally good, as was the Chilean Carmenere. Great service - efficient and friendly.. Special thanks to Farad. I'll be back next time I'm here
5
Excellent service n great food but noise level a bit high on Friday night . Cod fish was very fresh n delicious.. thumb up
5
nice place and good selection of wine. we choose to taste their wine of the month promotion, lovely place
4
We headed there for some drinks after dinner and as impressed with the ambience. The band there was really good. We also ordered a Quack pizza which wasn't as good as expected. The sauce was on the saltier side. But overall it's good to be there for a chill night
5
Nice and quite place to enjoy with family or with friends. Food are delicious. Only down side is if the staff can have better knowledge of wine.
4
friendly service crew that is prompt and attentive. they are ready to offer suggestions and alternatives and maybe a little chit chat if time permits. they really made me feel comfortable, this is noticeable even when the restaurant gets a little bit crowded. Food quality / taste / portion is good and the price is what I considered reasonable.The setup is spacious and every table is spaced out. Wonderful for those date nights or business discussion.spaciousness is a place for those bigger groups or families. They are also pet friendly, except guests with pets would have to settle for al fresco dining.Ambience is good and I personally love the quiet afternoon to unwind with a cuppaThere is also magician, bands entertaining guests on certain evenings. -Thumbs up
5
This is my 3 times visiting this restaurant. Their foods taste was consistently tasty. Services is fantastic, waiter are Super friendly and all my Friend loves it!!!
5
This was my 3rd time at Skyve . There were consistently excellent . Food , Drinks , Service , Ambience , Lounge Music - Perfect ! Definitely returning for more .
4
Smart casual restaurant and lounge tucked away in a quiet street near Newton. Love the atmosphere and the patio allows dogs. We love coming in the evenings for drinks and bites. Brunch menu is wide with an assortment of breakasty and lunch items. I ordered truffle scramble. Apart from the truffle aroma I'd say the dish was basic but well executed.
4
Good place to chill and catch up without having to shout , food was decent with good service, enjoyed the croissant eggs Benedict especially , unique and tasteful.
5
Went for drinks, stayed for dinner. Its tucked away in an old 50's school building, decor reflects ts origins 50's armchairs, school like dining chairs, with an Asian twist. Happy house drinks were priced well, service was good but not intrusive. Dinner menu included lots of seafood and some lovely wines at reasonable prices We were allowed o take our time to choose and to look at the bottles with no pressure at all and some good advice. I opted for the beef ($45) which was melt in the mouth, hubby's lamb disappeared very quickly. Beautifully presented too,. Live music that was not too loud and a delicious desert (with two spoons) ended a lovely evening. Overall attention to detail with the food and the service made a difference for us
4
Restaurant location is not too difficult to locate and its quiet (only restaurant thr). Food is abit on the pricey side but it taste yummy. Both Pork and beef is tender and juicy. Nice! Tried the dessert platter - not worth it. Super small portions of cakes, totally not satisfying at all. Cheese platter serving is pretty generous with 3 types of cheese. Overall ambience was good, food was good.
4
Enjoyed lunch with friends in this lovely, peaceful, light filled setting. The fish wrap was delicious. Prices are reasonable and the service was attentive without being obtrusive. Will be back
4
pricey but good food. expect to buy $70 each if you want to dine here. I enjoyed the live music and the coziness. the staff are also well trained and polite and we received a complimentary cake as it was my friend's birthday.
3
We went there with a group of friends. We were not really focused on the food...much more on the drinks. I must say we had many many bottles but it happens that one of them was not nice in terms of quality. We told the manager about it. Asking him not to charge us for this bottle. The least I could say is that he was absolutely not customer oriented and simply refused to do so. Not the slightest gesture. We were all quite disappointed although we had great evening all together
5
The food was good and it was a great place for catching up with friends or having a date. We enjoyed it so much that my friend left her laptop there but the staff was alert and ran out to pass it back to us. Great service!
5
Great food, nice ambience, top-notch service - sums it all. A waitress very promptly placed an extra pillow for my pregnant colleague the minite she sat down. Opens doors for me when I stepped out and back in restaurant for a while. There was even a surprise complementary cake for my pregnant colleague, with wordings "congratulations on the baby!". What a sweet gesture. The fried mushrooms appetiser was yummilicious
4
The whole compound was converted from an old school building. I believe Skyve Wine Bistro's venue was the school hall. There were not many people, as it was a weekday, and almost 2pm. But the atmosphere was nice. I had 3-course set lunch with Cod fish as the main. It was lovely. One of my boys' Shrimp on a Barbie Pizza was very tasty. Worth the visit
5
The food was awesome and the service staff was very attention. Thank you for making my wedding solemnization a memorable one
5
My wife and I had a fantastic dinner there, made even more special due to the attentive and thoughtful nature of the staff.The moment we walked in, the waitress noticed that my wife was 6-months pregnant and immediately offered to get her a cushion so that she could sit more comfortably. The service throughout dinner was attentive and not over-bearing. While there might be many places that offers similar food, I can say that the quality of service is top notch, and my wife and I will definitely go back in the near future
2
Food and service was merely average, though the ambience was nice. Burger was alright but pasta tasted pretty bad for one which cost $34. Bill with an order of only 2 main dishes totalled to $80.
5
This was my second time at Skyve, yet first time for dinner. The atmosphere is very inviting and one of the most important aspects of the restaurant is we are able to bring out puppy; by which the staff brought her water to drink. The staff is very accommodating and interactive to our needs and wants, something i find you always do not get in restaurants in Singapore. The drinks, appetizers, and main course can in the correct order; and the chef even made me a vegetarian pasta dish that was not on the menu. The food was delicious, a bit pricey but expected in Singapore. The best part was that the staff had a cake ready for my son in honor of his bday. !! Excellent place I would recommend to my friends to try it out
5
We had a wonderful time there. The staff actually overheard that one of us was celebrating birthday and surprised the birthday girl with a small slice of cake at the end of the meal. Superb! Not to mention, great ambiance. Will definitely revisi
4
Good ambiance. Service was good.Food was served promptly. Food was reasonable and taste ok.There is a band
4
Had both the beef and kurobuta pork burgers. Both were flavourful Waitress was very attentive and kept filling our water glasses without being asked.
5
Had dinner on Saturday and although the place had filled up, (1) it wasn't noisy given that the tables were spaced quite far apart, and (2) service was prompt. A (small) band was playing which gave the place even better ambiance. As for food, the wait staff and Chef were more than happy to oblige food preferences, intolerances and allergies. Kudos to the ever patient and attentive staff as they catered to my (rather long) list of intolerances. I had the Hibachi Pork which was moist and tender. Fortunately for me, the portion was sizeable, enough to satisfy my ravenous appetite.Price wise, reasonable given quality of food, ambiance, etc. Pricing is even better with entertainer and/or cheers app. Will definitely visit again
5
The perfect place to get together with loved ones or friends for a quiet (eg you can easily have conversation) out with great food (the beef rosette is divine), great wine and excellent service
4
A pleasant experience with attentive service and good food. We had the beef burger and it was very tasty and filling. Well worth it for the 1 for 1 mains promotion using the Entertainer App.
5
Very nice place with nice ambience.Great Food and the live band was nice.Definitely recommended for couples and friends dinner
4
Set lunch was good quality and decent sized portions. Down side no vegetarian option. Not busy no need to book midwee
1
Took my Mom here for Mother's Day and immediately regretted it for the following reasons: 1. My mom ordered a salad that had beets and pumpkins. She doesn't like beets, so wanted to remove the beets and suggested that they just make up the difference by adding a bit more pumpkins. Apparently you have to pay extra to have more pumpkin even though you are saving on the bets. HATE places that are so cheapskate. Don't they know what customer delight means? 2. They place Fiji water bottles on each table to trick you into drinking them and subsequently paying for them - don't fall for this and order iced water instead.3. Food was SO mediocre for the price. I ordered the portobello burger ($34) (above) while my parents ordered the duck confit (which I read good reviews about on Burpple). My parents were very underwhelmed and didn't even comment on the food. Each duck leg is served with a tablespoon of mash and is about $34 if I'm not wrong. Food was just SO blah.Avoid this place
4
It was a nice atmosphere but there was no lobster... the pork was really nice and so was the tenderloin w bacon. My Son loves the rocking chair
3
We had the 1 for 1 burgers. The beef patty was tasty but the burger lacks condiments. It would be better if there was more generous greens, and sauce. The fries were dry. It's not worth $30
4
It was our anniversary dinner and we were also given a complimentary desserts. Food was good and love the ambience!
4
Celebrated work anniversary with a lunch at Skyve. The set lunch is amazing. With rather large portions and very well done. Had duck confit and lamb shank and it's heavenly. Soft, tender and yet still juicy and full of flavour. Surprise by the dessert where they inscribed ' Happy Work Anniversary' on the plate. Nice touch and shows they were attentive. Will visit soon
1
Apparently there are some foods that you can order and cannot order depending where you are seated. Have already wrote in to their management weeks back and there is no reply from them yet
4
Recommended by friends to discover this hidden gem in old school area, this trendy and modern bar bistro with sofa and benches offers a range of exquisite tapas; mini burgers, truffle French fries, fresh oysters, hearty pizzas, nachos... Dine in also available in the restaurant section
1
Visited Skyve for lunch on a weekend, was placed in a quiet corner for easy conversation with my friend. The gesture would be appreciated if it hadn't been so difficult to get some attention from the service staff. I requested for my Aglio Olio to be made more spicy, but what was served to me was horrendously bland with no taste apart from heat from the chilli flakes! There was no taste of garlic, wine or even salt/pepper. I resorted to adding a dash of salt on it but it was still too awful to finish. The truffle fries, which at many other places easily make me smile, were also disappointing. One member of the service staff asked for my feedback when he noticed my food wasn't finished. Plus points for his attentiveness, but unfortunately it's not enough to make me want to return.
1
food is average and price is expensive. it was my first time going there. the ambience is ok. but i wont go there to eat again...
3
Food was pretty good. Sous vide pork chop was well cooked but a tad too spicy. Soft shell crab with soba was crispy and well seasoned.They should consider cloth napkins instead of paper
5
Service was good. we requested for another table and the servers were quick to check and respond. Servers were polite and orders were taken correctly. Tried the Crab Soba Salad and i love it! the Galbi Ribs was recommended by many people but i personally think it was alright only. the Beef pasta seems to be lacking some punch. we went in the afternoon for late lunch on a public holiday. not crowded and overall decor of the restaurant was pleasant.
4
Organised a small gathering and was given a good corner table. Ample space so you don't feel close your neighbours. Waiters are friendly and attended to our enquiries. Food wise, as we went for the 1-for-1 promotion, main course selection is limited but everyone enjoyed their selections. Appetisers are good as well.
4
Nestled in a quiet area of Newtown, i would recommend this place for families with young kids to have brunch. Plenty of space for the kids as well as the adults to have conversations in a nice ambience with a choice of indoor or outdoor setting. Service staff is attentive and accommodating but the food is average that comes with a hefty price tag.
4
Relaxing atmosphere with a spacious and bright interior, good for big groups. Reasonable pricing for food and drinks, especially with Entertainer app
5
Quiet place during weekdays. Food was simply cooked but quality was great! Service was excellent! Will definitely come back again
5
Always the best place to come with the family and enjoy delicious food. Highly recommend to come with family
5
Oysters were fresh, quality food, big portions, good pricing. Great ambience and attentive waiters throughout the evening! Will be back
5
While the food here is delicious, I feel that it is slightly overpriced as the restaurant has a more casual feel. Would recommend using the entertainer ap
5
The wait staff were fantastic the food were fantastic .. one of the few fusion restaurants I will go back to ..
3
Went to Skyve for dinner on a Saturday. The restaurant had a children's event, it was hard to converse with my dinner companion over the din. We used the entertainer app for the visit but we could only select items from a very limited list. In the end I ordered the parmesan beef burger - unmemorable dish. My advice would be to use the cheers entertainer promo instead. The other food options might be nicer.
5
Love the ambience of the place. Service crew is very professional and helpful. Highly recommend!!!! Food is fantastic and value for money
5
Amazing food, outstanding service, great ambience and feel to it.Great space at a very unassuming and quiet location.Went for brunch and as am pregnant they took special care of, gave me a comfrtable seat with a cushion and later delughted me with a compimentary dessert congratulating me for having a baby. Must try for everyone, I am waiting to be able to try their wine.
1
We wish that we could give this place zero stars. The bottle of wine that we ordered taste like vinegar - I kid you not. The staff was indifferent and the food less than acceptable. We hope that this review makes one think again about eating here. Just awful!
5
Great service, quiet atmosphere and good food and beverage menue. We tried a few snacks/appetizers and they were all good and the portions generous
5
Food was very good and the ambiance was equally as good. Hopefully the standard would maintain during our weddin
4
We walked quite a long way from our hotel to this bistro that we saw with a quite a high ranking! We took the signature dishes, the grilled pork rib and the cod fish... both are very tasty with good portion of side dishes...Overall is good but deco and the live music are so so..
3
Did not expect such a posh restaurant to be tugged in such a quiet lane in Newton. The ambience is nice and the deco tastefully done.The food is only average but the desserts are really nice. Nice for hanging out with friends after work if you dun like crowded places.Prices are on the high side though
4
Visited on a Friday evening. Live music provided by a duo was playing in the background and was very pleasant. The food was great. In particular the hibachi pork was succulent and flavoursome and overall was an excellent dish. The duck legs were also full of flavour and well cooked. The dessert of molten chocolate pudding was also above average. The only thing stopping this being a five star review was the service. Whilst certainly not bad it seemed a bit obtrusive at times. Perhaps the waiting staff are trying too hard. Nevertheless this is a quality restaurant and would not hesitate to visit again or recommend to others. The live music is a nice touch
3
I used to be a regular at Skyve for the quirky creative menu and ambience, but the kitchen and waiters have become complacent. Menu has been shortened, dishes taste bland and service is haphazard. Still a good place for wine though, with good selection of bottles economically priced
4
Food was great! The cosy ambience made all the invited guests felt comfortable and the bunch of service crew were very attentive. Definitely worth the subsequent visits
5
Visited skyve for a birthday celebration. A staff called to get the name of the person celebrating the bday. Overall, staff was attentive and polite. Service was good, food was served promptly and to satisfaction. Recommended.
4
Great food and great service. It's a tad expensive but I guess you get back the value through the taste and service rendered.
4
I had a sous vide pork and it was lovely. Decent place with prices are a little more expensive but worth it. the location is unique and the place is comfortabl
4
It's a good place for dinner. I would like to visit there next time. The waiter there are very kind and charming
5
It's definitely a hidden gems in town area! Nice place, friendly staff, good food. Just slightly pricey, yet still affordable. Worth trying out the place!
5
Awesome service. Food was wonderful. I like the location of the restaurant which is at a quiet corner of Winstedt Rd
4
A place you can enjoy your food with a peace & quiet enviroment. Good for small group and nice price for business discussion
5
Excellent Staff Service and good food! Staff even gave a complimentary cake to wish me speedy recovery. Very thoughtful. Baby friendly place too 
4
Very nice dinner and staff was kind enough to prepare a piece of birthday cake for us. A little pricey but enjoyed the food and quiet environment.
5
I really loved the Hibai Pork because I cannot believe how it could be so well-seasoned for a thick slice of meat. I cannot describe the taste exactly, but it tasted of a satay-like seasoning with some salt and pepper. It was absolutely delicious and outshine the other good-tasting dishes as well, such as the Beef Rosette. I also had the Uni Spaghetti as appetizer, though it tasted like it's fresh from the sea, the saltiness from the sea which was strong in the sauce which the spaghetti was cooked in. I also had 2 200ml bottles of Australian Moscato which could easily serve up to 2 glasses. Overall very glad to have visited this place, and would definitely try another time.

The service was excellent, they prepared a card and cake for the birthday celebration! The pork was perfectly tender! The miso cod fish was a tad too sweet tho! Still, will def go back!

It's been quite some time since my last visit. I recall in my last review of Skyve ages ago I mentioned that the food was consistently good but, the service level was declining. This recent visit was absolutely delightful. Skyve still manages to pack a crowd and the original service level quality has returned if it better. The duck confit was delicious as was the steak. We ended off on a sweet note with an extra complimentary dessert... this dessert was special as it was a warm gesture from Skyve wishing me a speedy recovery. I had broken my leg and arrived with my kids on what was my first night out of the house with them since my accident. The staff noticed me hobbling in with my crutches and toward my table. It was a really nice ending to what was already a delicious meal with my family.
4
Food and service is good. Great for a quiet dinner on a weekday as restaurant is not crowded. Parking is easy as there are ample lots in the compound
5
For a start, I love the truffle fries. Service was excellent too. The staff made great recommendations on the main course. Good place to relax and enjoy

Was there at the restaurant (not the bistro) for lunch date with the hubby. Quiet setting away from the hustle and bustle, Used to be a school canteen and there're elements of the furnishings giving that away. Didn't like the dining tables and chairs which look "cheap" instead of "classy" - maybe it's intentional but that wasn't my expectatiion of the restaurant. Food wise was ok, we were excited about the confit duck leg but were disappointed it looked a little too deep fried and that instead of a rich deep sauce, it was a tangy plum sauce turning the entire dish reminiscent of Peking duck. Not what we were expecting at all - it was lucky we had white wine not red. Appertisers (I had salad) and desserts (choice of two cakes) not worth mentioning. Wine pairing recommendation on the menu was spot on. Maybe it was lunch on a weekday and restaurant wasn't set up to wow? We did make advance booking..Romantic? N Quaint? Y Peaceful? 
5
Went there for our Valentine's Day dinner with 4 other couples. Though a big group of 10 the waiters served us professionally and cheerfully helping us to take lots of pictures in the midst of their busyness. The food is really fantastic too. This place is tastefully decorated in a nostalgic way. Worth a visit!
5
If I could give six stars, I would - thank you, Skyve, for the great evening.Celebrated my birthday in a group of 15.The service was fast and extremely attentive, and the food and drinks were great as well.Loved the attention to details and especially the extra eye you had on the two pregnant friends. We will definitely be back
4
Every time I've been to Skyve, they have great food and a beautiful ambience available. Service is generally very good but last weekend when I was there, they were really Low on staff but still trying to manage everything! Great effort! Also love the space for kids, especially the swing outside
5
Absolutely love the vibe at Skyve! Service was great, staff were very friendly and helpful. Seats were very comfy too. Had the uni spaghettini (main course portion) and it was delish! Would def recommend it.
5
We love the service and the food, it was a very pleasant day to us as the staffs did a very good job for making this event very successful. Thank you Skyve :
5
Cosy quiet ambience . Celebrated a birthday there . Staff was so considerate and attentive. Food and drinks were excellent ! Definitely worth the 5 stars.
4
Amazing food, excellent ambiance, great location!! The breakfast burger was the choice to make here. Hearty portions, fresh ingredients and friendly service! Highly recommended for large group or intimate couples.
5
I had my wedding lunch at Skyve on a Sunday afternoon. I must say that it was the best decision for us. Maggie and her team had provided excellent service leading to the event. We went there several times and I would have to say that Skyve maintained the standard every time. The food were also excellent!! My guests had nothing but praises for the tasty food dished out. I would definitely recommend Skyve to be the venue from weddings to birthdays or even simple dinners
5
Cosy location with beautiful interior decorations. I hosted a 30 pax solemnisation event at Skyve on the 7.1.17. My guest loved their amazing customer service and their buffet dishes. What we ordered and guest adored!Cod Fish with Cereal crustBBQ pork ribsChicken leg with mushroom saucePrawn Cocktailchocolate eclairfruit tart
4
The place was a little walk from the mrt if you don't drive. Found the sous vide egg to be eggcellent! The whiff of the truffle oil was distinctive. Burger did not disappoint with unique rectangle patty nicely done. Duck confit was good but the sauce was way too tart. Tiramisu was disappointing. Presentation was nice in a pot simulating a garden but the liqueur flavour did not stand out and taste was bland.
5
A lovely find in a quiet residential street of Newton. We went for brunch - a great selection including full English style make-your-own, and tasty coffees. Very reasonably priced. Cal, and relaxed setting, stylishly decorated, inside and outside seating. Good service.Next stop will be to go for evening meals, wine and live music. Very much recommended
5
Surprised us with a cake for my wife who's expecting! The manager was really friendly and helpful too.
5
Went there to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The food was amazing and the staff were very friendly. Ambience was great, really romantic, but good for group gatherings too. Complimentary dessert even though I also ordered one, so we had two plates of desserts! Overall super impressed
5
Food was excellent, modern fusion style menu. Service was prompt. The entertainment provided that night was a magician who was engaging and interesting as well
4
Christmas dinner average Restaurant environment niceRestaurant service good & friendly.Chef & service staff are Very attentive towards any allergy.Flexible in adjusting the menu for us due to allergy. Tried their dinner buffet at a wedding held there, was really good & worthy
4
We had brunch there on boxing day. It was quiet and felt nice and cosy. Great place for a nice brunch for a slow start to the weekend/holiday
5
Actually we came here because all brunches were already booked. But was a good time! Ambiance, food, service, we had it all. Thank you for the great time here
4
We've tried many places for oysters but Skyve serves the most succulent and freshest oysters. The bulgologi and chicken wings are to die for as well.
5
Visited this place again last night.1st impression: ok this time I was surprised, quite a crowd and noisier as compared to last times. Acoustics was not good and we thought the place has lost its coziness and we should be disappointed this time, but we were wrong.Out came the same service staff and she made the whole experience perfect again. The effects of the large crowd and noise level somehow gets thrown out from our senses and our focus was turned to the good wine and food recommended, and also the good service rendered.It was a good choice to come back again. Thank you for the evening and see you soon again :
5
My partner and I went there on my birthday and the service there was outstanding and the meal was one of the best I had had in a while
4
Had Christmas Eve dinner, food & ambience is great, small & cozy. Not very good if everyone is talking at the same time, a little loud. Location is good but not so easy to find, it's a little hidden from main road
4
The mains were great. We had the cod, beef burger and roast pork and they they didn't disappoint. The service was great too.Molten chocolate cake was adequately moist but the snickers bar dessert was a let down. Value for money with the entertainer one for one
4
The food was good - go earlier on the wkend to try to uni spaghetinni though. Was a waste we didn't get to try it. Makes up for the lousy acoustics although outdoor sitting is another option you may wish to explore if the weather permits!
5
Great ambience with excellent live music. Recommend both the beef tartare and main course, extremely juicy and tender. The waiter was very friendly and even offered to split all the courses for us when he knows we want to share our dishes :)I had a pleasantly enjoyable night. However the price might not be your everyday meal so save this for one of your special date
5
Whether you are looking for a place to eat, chill or drink, Skyve has it all! And the experience is completed with the great service provided by the team of passionate staff
5
The food was great. Service staffs were knowledgeable to advice me good recommendations on food and drinks.
5
Lovely beef and my husband was especially impressed with the lamb. We had a great time, made better with the Entertainer App! Second time visiting, and won't be our last
5
This was my second visit to Skyve and again I'm very impressed with their service and food :) A little pricey but the quality really makes up for it! Thanks to all the staff for being so attentive & polit
4
Went on a Thursday night when they have a magician performing from table to table for an hour. Food was well done - I would say their duck confit is of the best in town
4
A nice environment with large spaced tables. Breakfast burger has a sizeable beef patty and delicious fat truffle fries. We were a table of 9 and the kitchen took about half an hour to get all our dishes ready to be eaten together
4
Looking for a nice place to unwind with a couple of friends? You will find it in Skyve, Newton circus. Next to the famous Newton Hawker Food centre - loads of parking, great food and fantastic drink menu. They also have live music on Friday and Saturday. Great brunch on Sundays too. You may need to reserve!
1
It isn't awful, but it's not good either. The room is divided in two. The front room has more comfortable bench seats but low tables that make eating a bit awkward. The back room has normal height tables and chairs, but it's an open style look. Hard wooden chairs. It feels like cafeteria style and not fine dining which is what the food is priced at. We ordered oysters Kilpatrick first. They were not good. The oysters are too big and fleshy and tasted quite briny. The real crime was the supposed kilpatrick preparation. There was almost no bacon per oyster. The oysters are huge and there were only a few tiny fragments of bacon on each. Furthermore the bacon style and cut is wrong. You need some of the fat but there was none. And lastly the sauce was insufficient and too weak. It was a disastrous dish and unpleasant to eat. For mains we had duck confit and the burger. The duck confit was ok. The vegetables with it were a promising mix of Brussel sprouts and edamame. This mix was good but it was hopelessly over drenched in oil. The burger is served with fries in a mini steel trash can. It's a different and playful look. The burger was ok but nothing special. The fries were cooked in truffle oil and were not cooked well. They had absorbed too much oil. So, we had oysters, two mains, two glasses of white, one glass of red. No coffee or dessert. The meal cost $230+We simply can't understand the glowing reviews here. Poor to average food and poor ambience and high prices.
5
A trusty dining spot to retreat into as always! Haven't dined at Skyve for a while, upon visiting it's refreshed dining menu, food is certainly still up to standard. The signature truffle pasta was aromatic, and the chicken was wonderfully smoked. Service was attentive and accommodating too (the kitchen obliged to change the side in my main, thank you!
5
Excellent service is a rarity in Singapore. We arrived for a birthday lunch, and as soon as we walked in, one of the staff noticed I was carrying a present and asked if we were celebrating a birthday. She took note of the birthday boy's name, and she quietly identified him later to confirm. At the end of the meal, she and another member of the staff presented him with a small birthday brownie.In addition, one of our dining partners was coughing a lot. Out of nowhere, one of the staff members appeared with a glass of warm water with lemon slices. He continued to quietly check on her throughout the meal.The food was good, the ambiance was nice, but what really stood out was the service. We will definitely be dining here again.Thanks to the staff for surprising us with excellent service (and showing that it is possible to get good service in Singapore)
4
We had been to Skyve a couple of times and loved the place. The food is excellent and service is extremely attentive
5
The normal fresh oysters are nice and big, pizza parma is yummy and the foiegras is good. Live band starts 8pm, 2 piece band. Ask for the seats at the lounge to have romantic experience
5
food wise is average. we had steak burger and duck leg confit, average food and quite pricey. typical western food tastes, nothing special.
5
Visited the place with my fiancé upon learning that Skyve had many great reviews. After our dining expetience, i know why. Excellent service, unrivalled beef burger, extremely cozy and romantic atmosphere, convenient parking. What's there not to love about Skyve!
4
It's a frequent come to place whenever we have friends gathering. However reservation can really be a pain when you are reserving for a big group. You'll be sent an email to print out a form that states penalties on missing attendance etc and is required to sign before sending it back. It is quite a lot of effort but probably because of the location of the place, they rely more on reservations than walk in hence needing the confirmation. Food wise, they have not failed to deliver. Loveeeee the pork cheeks burger with the meat sooo tender and the added kimchi is such a surprise. The kids ordered a serving of pancakes but we were disappointed that the pancakes came abit charred which wasn't ideal for the kiddos. We feedback to the service crew and they offered to redo. We are grateful for that but when the second batch of pancakes came, they were still kind of charred... we made do by scrapping those off and feeding the kids with the remaining
5
Booked a table for 2 for my wife's 35th birthday. The moment we arrived, we were greeted with a smile from the guy who opened the door then a colleague of his showed us to our table. In the table my wife saw a sheet of paper with greetings from the crew. Then after that we were given the menu and we ordered. The crew are very kind and attentive whenever we call for assistance. The food prices are ok ( I spent 130+ for 2 with 1 glass of white wine) and the taste are quite nice. I would definitely recommend this for any couple looking for a quiet and relaxing dinner without the stiffness of a fine dining
4
Food was good but service a bit slow due to a wedding event, so don't go when there is a major event
5
We had a huge kids party at Skyve on 16/10/16. The planning process, communication with events manager Jessica, food quality, service & ambience were just EXCELLENT! The staff also showed lots of flexibility to the flow of the event. All our friends had only positive feedback to give
5
The staffs are very friendly and kind heart - they keep worrying if my fiance (now husband) and I thirsty or hungry during wedding lunch (as we were busy in serving friends and families). They serve us drinks automatically whenever we seize chance to have a small break in the event. Besides the atmosphere, the sound system quality is nice too~ food and beverages are tasty as well! All my guests are very satisfied. Highly recommend to have a small wedding banquet here.
5
I've been coming back to Skyve for five years now. The duck confit alone is worth returning again and again! The romantic and quiet atmosphere is always a welcome relief from the noise of the city as well
5
Was greeted well over the phone reservation for my wife's birthday. Experience onsite was wonderful with live band (not too loud) on a Friday night and a surprise "Happy Birthday" note and song for my dearest. Food, wine and ambience were all excellent! Great place tucked at a corner of Newton for a costly pre-weekend
5
Cozy cafe with warm ambience and tasteful decor. Food quality was good and generous portions. Service was impeccable. Will definitely go back again. The restaurant is located near city but yet not in a concrete build up area. Great location.
4
I recently had dinner and breakfast here as it's very close to my apartment.Overall I was impressed with both visits. Dinner was contemporary and wine selection was solid. Breakfast was memorable and I love the fact that I can bring my dog to sit with me in the outdoor eating area.Will be back
5
Location: Although not exactly a convenient location, this place is not that difficult to access. You can take a bus down from the Newton MRT station and alight opposite the petrol station, cross the road and walk in about at most 100 m and you see the side gate to the restaurant. It seemed to be in a school or something. For parking wise, I am not sure but the road is a one way traffic, therefore take note when you drive here. FoodThis restaurant serves Western food. We had pan seared fish fillet and roast chicken. The taste is really good and the appetiser of Spaghetti with truffle and egg was amazing. The dessert was self made Ice cream and I enjoyed it very much with a lot of Lime and Lemon zest taste.AmbienceThe Ambience is pretty modern and laid back. They have also out door seating.OverallI will come back here again given that the taste is good and I like the spaciousness of the place
4
Hidden in the corner Of Newton. Elegant, cosy little bistro. Great place for desserts, drinks (cocktails) isn't fantastic. Service was splendid!
5
Located at a quiet location, Skyve Wine Bistro provides a calm and relax dining experience, away from the busy and hectic lifestyle. The friendly and experienced staff brings your whole dining experience to another level :) Food served were FANTASTIC! Overall, i had a very very wonderful experience at Skyve Wine Bistro. Thank you Skyve Wine, Kudos
3
The service was excellent! While the restaurant is trying to present itself as a place for fine-dining, there are a couple of things that work against it. The first one is that there are two sections there. One section looks for fashionable and suitable in design for fine-dining. The other section has the appearance that just doesn't work. It did remind me of some places I go for chicken-rice. This gets worse when coupled with the fact that there are people there in slippers and shorts. The food, I think was very good, if only the chef was not so heavy handed with salt. We ordered cod and duck leg confit. Both were extremely saltish. My friend could not finish the duck. Nothing that can't be solved with a few glasses of water afterwards. But as mentioned earlier, very happy with the staff and service and great thank you to them
5
It was a extremely pleasant experience during our visit on the 17 SEP 2016.We had with us an expecting mother and her choice of food was very limited due to her condition. Skyve was very accommodating to listen to her needs and prepared what she wanted, we were impressed. She was also ensure to have a more comfortable seat with plush cushions, while the rest of us had the conventional seats. Towards the end of the meal she was also given a complimentary dessert to congratulate her on becoming a new mum soon.We will be a return customer, as this left us with very good impressions. 
1
Came for my wife's bday and was terrible service. Did not feel welcome. Would not go back or suggest anyone go here
5
Wonderful dinner for my husband's birthday. 23 people in the lovely private room area. Food and service were excellent but importantly Celine and Jessica and team were responsive and so easy to deal with and very accommodating. All our guests were very impressed
5
Fantastic food, atmosphere, live music and best of all friendly, professional service - rare in Singapore! Excellent wine list a bonus and good value. Definitely coming back!
4
 Very good we enjoyed our time. Service and wine were good as well. We thought that the food came out in a timely manner and everyone was served around the same time!
4
Food was delicious however it may be slightly tricky to locate the restaurant. Great service and ambience
4
A hidden gem - service was good, crew took initiative to surprise my friends who are getting married. Fat and fresh oysters, overall great food except for the seafood platter; could have been better.
4
Celebrated my first year wedding anniversary here and booked through Chope months in advance. I was pleasantly surprised by a note from the restaurant signed by its staff with their well wishes. Service was prompt throughout as well. For the food, we ordered the pork, which was raved about by other reviewers. It was good, and again surprised by the barley risotto which was really tasty! My husband ordered the beef burger which met our expectations. Ambience was good, was quite a quaint place at first till the other groups started to stream in. Lastly, we had the molten lava cake (yums) and a complimentary piece of banana cake (yums too) but overall a really sweet touch. Thanks for the well wishes! Recommended for all occasions - a casual first date or an anniversary! We spent $114 in total though, so it was a little pricey! (This included additional truffle fries as well!
5
Very pleasant experience here, hideaway in the heart of town, we shared the duck comfit, scallops and the short ribs. It was a lovely dinner with friends
5
Was there to celebrate my galfriend's birthday. I only asked for a small cake but was pleasantly surprised to receive a letter signed by all staff. Birthday girl was thrilled when being presented ! Their oyster assortment is a must-try! (6 different types... we love the lychee flavour the most!). Service was superb. The price is on the high end side but its all well worth it... excellent food, both quality and presentation wise... coupled with warm and friendly service... ended the night with v nice live band.... why not?!
4
I came to Skyve not really knowing what to expect. The location is a bit out of the way, but it's well worth the visit. Skyve is nestled in a quiet sanctuary with indoor and outdoor seating and live music. The wine/alcohol selection is decent. The food was surprisingly good! Presentation was top-notch and it tasted delicious. I'll try the 3-course set dinner ($60++) next time. Well done
5
It's my third time back and despite the busyness of the weeknight (surprisingly busy for a weeknight), staff were attentive, the food excellent and the ambience awesome.
4
Chanced upon this restaurant one of the Friday evenings when we were looking for a place to have drinks and snacks. The house pours were average (but didn't expect much from house pours anyway) but the snacks were good. especially the spam fries were addictive. Generally good atmosphere. Live signer wasn't too loud so you can have a good conversation without shouting at each other
5
Our all time favourite dating place, good ambience, good service. And most impt of all, the food never fail to impress. Must try... Saketini oysters!!
5
I called in a day before to book a reservation for my family. Surprisingly, the caller was able to get my name from a previous reservation about two years ago. The staff asked over the phone whether it was any special occasion, and I mentioned that it was during the period of my father's, brother's and sister-in-law's birthday. On the following day at the restaurant, there was a simple birthday card with signatures from the staff. My family members also got complimentary brownie, and the staff trusted us enough and did not ask for any identification. I was thoroughly impressed. Of course, the food was great but the experience was made so much better by the attentive staff and the excellent customer service. Thanks a lot and keep up the great work! =
4
Located next to ACS Primary within an old school building this is a quiet place for dinner.It has Entertainer one for one.Ambience in evening is great. Not too crowded. Some nights there is a live band or an entertaining magician.Hokkaido scallops and sous vide spaghettini with prosciutto were both good.My miso cod was excellent.The cheese platter was big, good for 2-3! The chocolate pudding you could possibly skip unless you are a chocoholic
5
Great food, great Ambience, Great Service. A very thoughtful gesture from the team there as well when my girlfriend received a Happy Birthday card from them which i must say, was signed off by their staffs as well.
5
Good atmosphere. Live music. Excellent food. Excellent service. We were staying close and decided to give Skyve a try. Would thoroughly recommend a visit.
3
Tucked away in a lush green surroundings and with cosy interior, this is a nice place for gatherings over a meal. Food is average and fails to leave an impression
5
We'd been to Skyve previously for a wedding reception and had a great night. We accidentally stumbled across it again on a Sunday afternoon walk. Great food and drinks, reasonably priced and accepts the Entertainer so buy one get one free on main meals! Bargain.Nice relaxed chilled atmosphere for a rainy Sunday afternoon.Will definitely come back.
4
Nice brunch menu, quiet surrounding, have both indoor and outdoor seating, reasonably priced as well. Quite a walk from newton mrt, roughly about 15/20mins, driving over will be a better option
4
Its my first time be there. Surprising good in terms of environment, service and food. Luckily found it from website. In doubt that other tables have magician show but not for ours...Anyway, will visit and suggest others to visit
4
We reserved a table prior & was very glad to be given a cosy seat inside the restaurant. Instagram worthy interior & the staff were attentive & friendly. They also look really smart in their all black uniform, overall visitation was enjoyable, not to mention the food portion was pretty generous. i will highly recommend the Soba salad as it has a really refreshing aftertaste.
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday at Skyve and the staff surprised us with a complimentary cake as well as a personalised greeting letter.Great service!
5
I really like this area and the setting. Next to some art. The outdoor seating is good if you have a small dog
4
It was my boyfriend's birthday and the service crew have left him a thoughtful birthday note when we reached. Food was value for money, given the service standard and ambience. We thought it was alright to serve all the food at once, but they were meticulous enough to advise not to as the food will turn cold. Unfortunately the creme brulee was sold out that night, was hoping to try it that night. Will drop by again to try it! Thanks again for the great night
5
Decided to celebrate a friend's birthday here. Was pleasantly surprised by the personal touch provided by the staf
5
This is a really nice place. We loved the food and the atmosphere. The service was very good as well, almost too good. The waiters where over you the second you took a sip of your wine. The menu was exquisite and we didn't know what to choose. Overall a place that is worth visiting :-)
4
The quality of food that is served in this hidden gem with a cosy ambience far exceeds my expectations
4
As a carnivore, I still found the vegetarian burger to be excellent. It's got portobello mushroom, tofu and tempeh on a tasty bun. Never missed the beef. Goes well with Chardonnay. But at 35 bucks for the burger, it's quite expensive
4
good food in well hidden location. good for chillouts. kids friendly surprisingly. ample lots in car park . located next to acs junior
5
Great food, Cosy Ambience, Smooth music, Friendly Service. What more can you ask for? My wife and I went there for our 9th Anniversary and had a wonderful time. We had fresh oysters, Confit of Duck Leg and Sous Vide Duroc Pork Rack. I would recommend them
5
This is our 2nd time at Skyve. I was celebrating my Fiancee's birthday and the staff were really helpful. They made the celebration wonderful - excellent customer service. If you're for a nice place which is away from the crowds at malls, skyve is the place for you. The ambience is great. Highly recommended! Keep it up Skyve
3
I absolutely love their dinner offerings such as the Beef ribs and fish tacos. Theyre excellent. Went down to try their brunch for the first time over the weekend and went home utterly disappointed. The corn beef n hash was bland and the potato hash that came with it was vey dry and undercooked (crunchy but not in a good way). Pesto mushroom pasta was average but I had it much better on another visit during their dinner service. Maybe it was a different Chef. I won't be back for their brunch for sure. Time to up their brunch game because it's very competitive these days.
3
Service- very good ; truffle fries- good ; burger - average ; ago olio pasta - quite blend, not enough garlic though they were very good to provide more fried garlic as added service
5
A neighborhood gem! Providing lovely atmosphere, service excellence, and quality food/wine as usual.
4
Lovely Celebration of special day, since Skyve not only accommodated request but put in extra touch
3
We went for dinner based on a friend's recommendation. the food tasted alright but was on the expensive side compared to other restaurants (for the same food). The restaurant's location is also not very convenient and hence contributed to the overall lower ratings.
5
This hidden gem in novena was a great find. Very nice ambience. Good music over weekends. Spectacular food and courteous staff with good service. Celebrated my wife s bday here was not dissapointed. The corkage policy is good too. The only thing better Could have been the quality of proscecco. this place is good value for the dollar spent.
4
Went for brunch here as my cousin was staying at Sheraton Towers. According to her, it was a nice stroll from her hotel :) Service was excellent and the wait staff were very familiar with the menu.A nice cosy place with GREAT coffee
4
What a surprise..what looked to be nothing much from the outside, was surprisingly attractive in a modern but relaxed way. The menu was interesting, and the Salmon Caesar Salad one of the best...so fresh and tasty. It was great to see so many families there, obviously one of the better spots in the area. It was a little difficult to find, but well worth it. Congratulations to the staff and management
4
It's nice to see the food options expanding in the local area and this place, although a little hidden away, is definitely worth a visit. The food was great and there was a good choice of drinks. The decor is a bit hit and miss though and feels like it couldn't decide whether it wants to be a New York style bar or a suburban cafe but other than that we couldn't really fault it.
5
fantastic hidden gem. after locating the place we were very surprised at how lovely the restaurant was as it was part of a school property and not easy to find. staff we very attentive and made my mothers birthday celebration very special. The salmon Caesar and beef cheek burgers were highlight
5
Skyve is always the place to be! Great food and choice of wine is fantastic cos the owner CELINE knows her grapes!! Food? Food's always good. Good meat, love the pizzas and mini burgers! But my fav is definitely the braised beef ragout!!! Just thinking bout it makes me drool They've got acoustic 2 pieces on the weekends! And oh definitely breakfast is always yummy and hearty too ❤️❤
4
My colleagues (friends) surprised me with an early birthday lunch celebration. There were 10 of us and we tried different dishes on their menu. Prawn Aglio Olio, Eggs Bennie, Fish Taccos, and many more. But the dessert platter was the most special as they had brownie, vanilla ice creams, strawberry cheesecake and many more laid out very prettily! Would definitely come back again
4
I was really happy with the excellent service and food provided. I ask if they could arrange for a piece of birthday cake for my friend and they did with his name written on the side of the plate in chocolate. The ambiance is really cosy and the wine recommended is great. The waiter and waitress are polite and professional
5
Had a small party for my friends and families and everybody was very impressed with the food served and satisfied with the service from their staff.
5
Staff are so welcoming once you come in, made my wife and I feel right at home. Like to thank one of your waiters (I think his name is Matthew if not wrong) for his attentiveness. Thanks to him we realised this place is actually near a train station, saved us a taxi trip. Duck is very tender and juicy, I loved it. My wife said the eggs benedict was to die for, and she's a picky eater so well done. Wonderful cozy place, and we'll be eating here before we leave Singapore soon
5
Very good in all aspects! I have been here for brunch, lunch & dinner. Standard of the food never dropped! Never fail to impress
5
I have been there twice - once for Mother's Day dinner and another time, lunch with a friend. Firstly, I love that there are ample car park spaces at the restaurant's location. The ambience of the restaurant is lovely too. The service staff was attentive and when the waitress found out that it was a birthday lunch for my friend, she gave her a slice of complimentary cake. What I love best is the duck: crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.
5
Was there on the 22nd of May with some friends for brunch. The restaurant was was situated in a nice place and there are plenty of parking too! The ambience was nice and was not too crowded. The staff was amazing! They were attentive and friendly. When I ordered, I made sure my eggs were cooked well as I was expecting and to my surprised, they presented me with the most delicious chocolate brownie (hope I got the desert right lol) covered with caramel. That was really so sweet of them.The food tasted great and all of us enjoyed our dishes. I would also recommend their orange juice. Really awesome! Mus husband and I drank 2 glasses that day.Recommend their burger and choice of eggs with selected condiments. Will definitelt go back

We came here after having read so many reviews about the place. I liked the ambience of the place, and it was really nice and spacious, which made it a comfortable place to just chill out, unlike many other hipster cafes which we have been to in Singapore, where food were both overrrated and overpriced. Anyway back to Skyve, we ordered the benedict from their brunch menu, and it was well executed. The staff were really friendly too, and we truly enjoyed our brunch.

5 stars for food and ambience. 4stars for price. A little out of the way though, best way to get there is to drive or by cab
4
Well hidden but easily accessible. The setting was ambient and very pleasant. Staff was helpful and very friendly too
2
Came for brunch. Tasteless eggs - poached eggs were also hard - and ham straight from a packet. Toast not even buttered.
4
Delicious food and cosy ambience for your private and intimate functions.was there for our solemnization and it was fuss free with no hiccups from the brilliant staffs of Skyve Wine Bistr
5
Great food, ambience and a good choice for party celebration. The event organizer, Jessica is very helpful and meticulous at organizing the party event. The staff were friendly and attentive!Great job to the Skyve team
5
Was a friends birthday and we thought of Skyve as a nice, peaceful and beautiful setting to bring her. This was our second time there and they never fail to make us leave with a big smile on our face. From a cake, to a personal birthday letter at the table with all the staff's personal signature (let's not forget a call to confirm the name of the birthday person), to great food & drinks - Skyve never fails to impress us
4
Love this place! A cosy restaurant that constantly dishes out quality food. Love their ricotta hotcakes and other breakfast items.

Skyve is situated in a weird place, you have to pay attention where you are going else you miss it. we made a reservation but it was not busy. It didn't have the feel of a bistro, but was empty and modern, not a cozy place. Both of us ordered 2 starters instead of starter and main course. Skyves way is serving all the starters nearly the same time so food was getting cold. The quality of the food was good but not special. I would rate or experience 3,5 out of 5. Expected more based on review
5
Had celebratory dinner for friend's proposal and the restaurant actually prepared a signed card and wrote congratulatory messages on one of the desserts we ordered, and that caught us by surprise!

Service was great unfortubately the food is nothing to be wowed and the price certaintly makes it worst

My friend held his wedding last month at Skyve, and we really loved the ambiance of the place at first impression.When the dinner started, my friends and I had a few brushes with the Events & Marketing manager there, Maggie, and we found her to be a really rude individual. For instance, there was an occasion when I bumped into her accidentally. I apologized immediately, but she gave me a stare down and walked away without acknowledging or replying.I also saw and overheard her complaining to the groom about how the guests are moving the seats to other tables in a very frustrated tone. As an events and marketing manager, is it really apt to be complaining to the stars of the night, the bride and groom? Shouldn't the manager try to resolve issues for the bride and groom as they are really busy running the show?The food was also only mediocre. As the wedding had a sizable amount of guests, I think the restaurant could not keep up with the pace, and the food quality was compromised. At certain point of time, some of the food trays were empty too. There were no awareness about the remaining quantity of food, and guests had to remind them to refill the food. Again, this is where I witness the "unwilling" and "black" face of the manager, Maggie. Nice place, OK food, bad manger

My brother recently had his wedding at Skyve. Personally, I didn't find the food fantastic nor the ambience great like how the other reviews were raving about. They were just ok at best but these are not the reasons why I gave 1-star rating. The service was horrible if I have to put it politely. This review is only an account of what I have experienced and observed but I am sure there are other guests who are just as unhappy with the service as I am.When I reached Skyve, I approached the Events & Market Manager, Maggie Yeo, identifying myself as the family member and politely asked if there is a room where we can put our belongings. Maggie replied me in a very rude tone of voice and a stare. Granted, it was not a big space and they do not have any extra rooms where family members can put their belongings. However, the rudeness and the stare were totally uncalled for.On 2 separate incidents, I witnessed Maggie speaking to my brother in the same rude tone in front of his guests. Once, about preparing the march in song which my brother forgot and another which my brother's guests merely moved an empty seat to their table. Personally I did not find these a problem at all, let alone being reprimanded in front of his guests. Again, totally uncalled for.The food was ok, nothing to shout about. However, food was only replenished when almost all the trays were empty. Guests have to wait quite a while before they see food in the trays again. Very inefficient if you ask me. Cutleries were not placed on the tables beforehand but guests have to get their own cutleries themselves. How different is this from buying a plate of chicken rice at the food centre or mixed vegetable rice in the food court?This is definitely not Skyve's first wedding event but this incident showed the lack of professionalism and poor service standards. As an experienced Wedding and Market Manager, Maggie could have put her words nicely in telling me that there are no rooms provided for storing of belongings. She could have spoken directly to the brother in charge of running the wedding arrangements or advise on what are the things not done and how to do it instead of having to reprimand my brother in front of his guests, not once but twice. Food should be replenished when it runs low and not when the trays are empty. Cutleries should be placed on the tables and not expect the guests to get their own cutleries.While I do not expect food quality or service standards of Celebrity Chef restaurants, Skyve can only be nothing more than a casual dining venue with normal tasting food and mediocre service. If one is thinking of having the most important day of their life or important corporate events to impress their clients at Skyve, they might want to drop the idea and look elsewhere. Skyve is highly not recommended
5
Excellent service and quality there, I liked the atmosphere as well. This is one of my new singapore spots i'd love to keep secret !Will be back for sur
4
Very good service, delicious and big portion of food. A very pleasant dinning experience. Will visit again with my family and friends.
5
This is my favorite restaurant in Singapore because of nice service and nice food!!Pp are also nice to my dog
5
Loved the truffle fries and eggs Benedict. Ordered mostly from the brunch menu. Good ambience to relax and chill at the same time getting to the place isn't that hard. Just a stone's throw away from Newton MRT. Definately will come again to try out other menu items.
4
Nice ambience with live band singingFind that not much food selection but there's a lot of different range of alcohol to choose from! Great place for after work chill! Had the duck confitte and luncheon chips, Taste perfect!
5
I will keep this short and sweet - food = great! Ambiance = lovely, customer service = next level and awesome.
3
Food is generally decent, although the portion sizes have generally decreased in the last 1-2 years. Service is acceptable but turnover in staff is very high and the last two times we were there the staff mistook our order
5
Came here for Brunch to celebrate me and my wife's anniversary with our baby girlNice , and quiet, clean and tidy place which you can sit down and enjoy your foodFriendly staff, they've printed us a certificate knowing that it is our anniversary!Wide variety in the menu provided and quality of food was greatWill definitely recommend others for Brunch / Lunc
4
The staff were very friendly. Food was good. And magic thursday with the magician was entertaining and enjoyed by everyone. Tks a lot
5
Restaurant with good ambience and live music performance (liking the genre). Wide selection of wines as well.
5
The ambience was very romantic. It has a very beautiful garden which I call it the secret garden. The garden have a swing which is very nostalgia. I had the Parmesan Beef Burger with truffle fries which is excellent. The beef burger patty was hand chope and grill to perfection. Definitely recommended and worth a revisit
3
I like the ambience and the renovation is also casual. Food is not bad but considering all aspects, price is on the high side. For those who stay in Cairnhill district, it is a good location as you can actually walk there.
5
Everything from food, service, staff, ambience was awesome! It's my 2nd time there, this time bringing my family :
4
Love the cozy environment, the staffs are very friendly. Good service with nice food. The live dual band performance with song dedication service making the ambiance even better. Will visit again. 
5
Staff is always very attentive and the Food quality is always maintain. I will highly recommend Skyve to Family and Friends
5
Service was excellent, email reply was prompt. top top service. Food was not too bad just abit oily for our preference. However, the overall service and ambiance of the restaurant is really good. Will love to go back for another celebratio
2
Food quality has decreased over time. They changed the menu and took out some of the best dishes. There was a waiter mopping the floor right next to us so our food ended up tasting like floor liquid. Back room has no ambiance, looks and feels like a school lab.
5
We had à good time for my birthday's wife. Foods are good quality, service was excellent. Just one thing to improve is about the décoration, chairs and table not adapted seem like in a cantine...glasses style also, lack of flowers,..however I would recommend 8/1
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday here, the staff were attentive and patient to take down our pre-arrangement prior to the date. Follow up was immediate. A birthday card was prepared and signed by all the staff on the day. The food was great as usual, and we had no complain at all. Indeed a memorable night for all of us.
4
It took me a while to write a review. I had my solemnisation/ROM 3 weeks ago at Skyve Wine Bistro and I got what I wished for. Simple yet intimate gathering with family and friends for our very special day. The food was great not only from me but my friends also agreed. The place was comfy and nice and they made sure that we have that specific area of the restaurant for our event. Though we had a little problem with the parking and location. It was kind of hard to find but other than that everything was great! Kudos to Maggie, dearest Maggie, who patiently chased me with all the details needed and made sure everything was in place. Thanks Maggie! Thank you Skyve. Will surely visit the place soon. :)
4
I had a beef burger, truffle fries, and skyver's wings and a glass of wine each for me and my friend.The beef burger was good, truffle fries was not too bad, could be better with skinny fries instead of the thick ones, wings are pretty average. Wine is good too. Highly recommend for couples for their date nights, as place is pretty quiet.

Went there for my mum's birthday after a slightly more hip establishment turned us down ("Sorry, we don't have high chairs. We can seat you in a booth. Would that work? No? Well, ahem." cue crickets)I am pleased to note that Skyve had a high chair and a lovely blond-haired waitress who not only ignored the mess we were making in the process of feeding our tyke, but also guided us through the menu. This was no mean feat as my mother reverts to early childhood herself when presented with menus, saying things like (upon spotting two burgers in a row at the top of the Skyve menu), " there are only burgers? Burgers! No other things?? Where? Who said got other things? Here only got burgers!!"In fact the menu was fairly extensive. We ordered salads which were delicious (get the momotaro and mozzarella salad - we ordered two, it was so goood) and then had lamb, duck confit and the ancho cod for mains. They were all pretty darn good. The chef kindly obliged my request to modify the cod recipe so that my 1.5 yr old could suck down a 0.005mm sliver of it. He came up with a smashing butter-based sauce which I would've drunk straight off the plate if I didn't have a toddler to model good behaviour for.Part way through the meal, the noise level at our table, already threatening to blow our eardrums due to the cheery tunes emanating from my kid's ipad, went up a notch when the one man band started playing. We were treated to every bit of his rehearsal and tuning. Not a nice experience. The staff good naturedly turned the restaurant speaker down to the lowest level. However, the acoustics of the place, rather echoey as it was, made it rather deafening to us sensitive-eared folks. We'd go there again to enjoy the very good cooking, but not when there is live music. Also, easy parking and the kiddo liked the rustic, hipster vibe and "haunted" playground on the premises of school within which this gem of a bistro is nestled
4
Great environment to chill on Fri nights, good food, lovin' the singing. Just thought we should be allowed to order from the bar menu while still seated at the restaurant area, and perhaps more items on the menu to choose from.
5
Love the ambience, food and service staff. Location is not easy to access unless you have a car. However if you do drive, parking is a breeze and you will definitely enjoy a quiet and classy restaurant like this. Good is unique and taste good. Good place for holding wedding reception or solemization.
5
Repeatedly great food, great staff and great ambiance! We have been a number of times and it's always on top form. Perfect for couples, groups and taking family to.
5
Nice ambience and quiet place. The food was of high quality standard and very delicious. We ordered seafood pasta and pork. Super tasty and soft meat and seafood. The staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely go back there again.
4
Good food, great service, wonderful acoustic band, nice decor and atmosphere. I discovered it totally by accident just googling a relaxing restaurant, it OVER delivered
5
Nice setup, nice staffs especially the GM. Everything and everyone is nice.Worth while to be there to have an event. Great Job Skyve!
4
Nice ambience, nice gesture of staff for preparing a birthday card and cake for my hubby. The food was good
5
went to skyve after making reservations using CHOPE. get a very comfortable sofa seat.all the waiter and & waitress were very active and friendly. always very prompt to request.thumbs up for the staff there~
5
A great place to dine with your love ones. Food was great on the valentine's day menu. Excellent customer service too, and we love the ambience, it makes us feel welcome.Also to thank Jasper for the awesome magic show!
5
I was very happy with the food and service.Service staff were attentive to details and were always on the lookout to wait on us.For example, they saw that we have finished our mains and were ready to bring the menu to us again.The menu when presented to us were already flipped to the dessert pages (that's what I call thoughtful)I like the sous vide-d food, the proteins really retained their natural jus and temperature. (the normal ala carte menu)All in all ... its a really happy place to be in :
5
thoughtful staff and the place was really romantic.it was my mum's birthday and they gave a free slice of cake and a birthday card, signed by every staff
3
Had a 4-course meal for valentine's evening. The X-factor was the fillet mignon(never had it before, so don't take my word for it), the puff pastry that came with it was slightly cold and doughy. Compliments to Skyve on getting their hands on probably the fattiest and juiciest oyster I've tasted by far, good choice for an appetizer. would have loved to trade the Gazpacho for another serving of oyster. Starters didn't stand out as much as the dessert. Hope it helps. Cheers
5
Celebrating the Valentines Day❤️,food is lovely awesome and really worth for its value.And the service is excellent I Highly Recommed Skyve to each and everyone great place and will be giving you great amazing experience.Perfect
4
We were greeted with smiles when we entered the restaurant and was guided to our seats promptly, thereafter a guy wearing a blue shirt (the rest of the staff were in black) served us and he was very attentive to our needs and was also polite to us throughout our meal. I enjoyed the meal thoroughly because of Skyve's delicious pork burger and great service from this particular guy. I hope he keep up with this impeccable service because good service is becoming a rare thing to ask for nowadays!
5
Everything about this experience was perfect. The ambience, the attentive staff and most of all the amazing food. Good portion sizes and selections.
5
Best lobster risotto and molten cake ever!!!!!!!Very attentive staff, service is superb.Thank you very much.
5
The food is very good! Especially their foie gras and sous vide egg spaghetti! Not only that, their service is of a good standard! You will not be disappointed. Trust me
5
My wife enjoyed her birthday celebration with the family at this place. The service staff are very friendly and attentive to our neededs and she had her memorable moments when our 6 year old son had his first own crafted speech on stage and singing the birthday song.Thank you Skyve for the great food and service quality .!!! Cheers !!

I was there for a birthday celebration with my partner and request for a comfortable and private seating. We were given the seat near the entrance of the restaurant on armchairs that were a little too high for the dinner table. Luckily there was an empty table for 4 pax with plush seating which we requested for and were given the seat. There was a live performer who we both felt was good. He took in requests and performed a variety of old and new hits effortlessly. Service was pretty good. Staff was attentive most of the time. Food-wise was pretty average. We ordered scallops, oysters, beef wrapped bacon, duck confit, wine (2 glasses for $26) and dessert. Duck confit was way too salty and the wine was pretty bad. I’ve ordered wine at $8 a glass that tasted much better. Beef wrapped bacon was quite good – seafood and dessert was quite ordinary. That said, the dessert was slightly customized with a birthday greeting which was a nice touch. Total bill came up to over $200. I think I could have gone to some place nicer for the same amount. It is not my first time here but possibly my last
5
The title says it all! Love the deco of the restaurant and it is tucked away in a nice quiet corner near town. The food is lovely and the best thing is the super attentive and friendly staff there! A hidden gem
5
Great ambience - Tucked in a quiet corner, it was nice and comfortable. No crowd on a Tuesday night.Great food - Lamb and beef were scrumptious! Fresh oysters all the way from Belgium. Bad seafood triggers allergy, I have none so, yes they were fresh!!! Tried all three - lychee, raspberry and the natural one. You should too! The wine from Coonawarra is awsesome!Great service - We were served by friendly and knowledgeable staff who went the extra mile. At the end of the night, one asked if we wanted a cab; she called one for us
5
Was deciding where to dine and Skyve bistro came to mind. It was an impromptu dinner date and I made the reservation via Chope. Easy and fuss free, instant confirmation. This is not my first visit to Skyve but for dinner yes. Glad we did. The restaurant gave a different feel in the night with live band playing and soft lighting which make the place cosy and nice! Food wise it did not disappoint as well. Ordered the Hokkaido scallops as appetiser, mains duck confit and steak wrap with bacon ( can't remember exactly the name of the dish ) . It was all perfect. Service was excellent too with the service staffs being very attentive to our needs. Definetly will be back again.
5
A lovely place in almost every aspect I can think of. My title says it all. It's a little on the pricey side but well worth the money for what you get. Especially lovely and quiet on weekday afternoons. Ask for a table at the lounge area
4
Arrived at the place but not sure where is the car park. managed to park along the roadside as it was single-yellow line.Went inside and found a cosy place. Had a nie dinner. The codfish was the best I had. The wine was fine too and we enjoyed the evening very much.Oh! Didi I forget to mention the waitress was very friendly and attentive.Regarding price, be prepared to fork out a bit more for all the good things the restaurant can offer
5
Food was fantastic and portion was big! The staffs were very helpful in planning a surprise birthday celebration for my boyfriend.
5
I do visit Skyve quite often to dine or just to chill and have drinks with friends. Venue is very cosy to catch up and food quality is superb! To add on, serving staffs are very attentive consistently! Will definitely recommend friends to visit
5
Good food,must try the oysters,excellent wine list.The overall atmosphere was delightful and the staff especially front of house were very attentive.Good parking available as well
4
Went here with a friend for lovely relaxed dinner in the outdoor seating area. We enjoyed the charcuterie platter, duck confit and lime semifreddo. Service was good if a little slow, not particularly cheap but worth it for a nice evening out
5
A new hangout place that we wanted to go. Reservation made online. Next day replied from the staff. Very efficient and helpful. Overall experience was great. Food at the Bar bites section is delicious.
4
Since November 2015, my wife and myself have been searching high and low for a venue for my son's 1st birthday.After several disappointing visits to other restaurants, we chanced upon Skyve through some online reviews.Went to the restaurant for dinner to try the food and it was great so decided to hold the party there.Skyve created a buffet for the party and we also had bouncing castle and ball pit delivered to the restaurant for the kids.The food was great and service was excellent, they paid attention to all my guests and made sure that the food was replenished promptly.Thanks to the Skyve team, the party was a success.Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely visit again
5
The food was splendid and so was the in-house entertainment in the form of a magician Also, with a simple request, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday girl, which made the dinner just so much more special! It was a great experience overall and I'd recommend it to lots more people
4
Skyve Wine Bistro has a personable service, making returning customers feel welcomed. I like to visit the restaurant for brunch with my girlfriends and so far, different groups of friends have expressed satisfaction with its food and ambience. It's really popular so do call ahead to make a reservation, in case they are booked for events like wedding receptions
5
Skyve achieves the balance of a casual setting and excellent service very well. We had a group of 8 adults and requested a quiet corner. Service staff regularly checked on us to make sure that everything was great. Food was really good the portions were more than decent and the wine list was extensive. A good option for vegetarians as the kitchen prepared a vegetarian pasta dish for one in our party. There was ample parking and the lots are spacious
5
Perfect place for friends to get together to enjoy the wonderful brunch menu! Highly recommended for friends who want to get-up after not seeing each other for so long :
5
Made reservation for a birthday celebration on a Monday night. Service was prompt, attentive and warm. The place was cosy for an intimate dinner. Try the pork rack
4
Excellent service and good food The atmosphere can be better and the location is not central I will definitely come back I recommend the place as is good and affordable
5
This is by far our favourite restaurant in Singapore - which is no small feat as we've pretty much eaten at every possible restaurant/cafe/bar/bistro/hawker centre on the island! We absolutely adore Skyve. Every time we've been there it has been consistently superb. The ambience is great - we love the decor, soft lighting and funky vibe; the staff are superb (they greet you by name at the door which I love) and are really friendly and relaxed (not a given in Singapore, where we find most waiters have zero people skills). But best of all is the food! We just adore this menu. My husband's favourites are the pot stickers, oysters, duck and the beef roulette. My favourites are the scallops, truffle fries, duck and the burger. If you want a gourmet burger that will utterly rock your world, you will not be disappointed. We also love our wine, so it's a nice surprise that there are some really affordable wines on the menu. And if you have a sweet tooth then you'll be massively excited about the dessert menu! Last time we went there we shared three desserts between two couples - the creme brûlée, the tiramisu and the chocolate dessert. Exceptional! It's lovely to go to a restaurant where it doesn't cost the earth to have an amazing night out. For Singapore - and considering the quality of the food here - it really is affordable. 5 star dining at 3 star prices. Oh, and an extra bonus - live music (acoustic guitar and vocals) several nights a week and a magician on Thursday nights! Don't be fooled - a magician may sound extremely cheesy but this guy is absolutely incredible and had my girlfriends and I amazed when we went there recently for a girls' dinner. We were left speechless! Such great entertainment. Overall, I couldn't recommend this restaurant enough. Oh, and we've also been there for lunch on the weekend with our children (2 year old, 5 year old and 8 year old) and it's really family friendly. You won't be disappointed

Skyve is a delightful little brunch/restaurant located at the outskirts of town, tucked away in a spacious greenery setting in a corner of Newton. The manager Chun Kiat (CK) is well known in the F&B industry for his industrious attitude and personalized service, with an eye for detail he ensures the satisfaction of every diner. I have patronized 2 of CK's previous establishments - Broth, and Boathouse; both businesses increasing their popularity rankings (to top 5 positions in Singapore's popular restaurants) under CK's management. It was therefore no surprise that Skyve has done increasingly well under CK. This was my second time to the restaurant, for a group of 15. Even for a large group, CK and his staff were consistently polite and informative, letting us know the estimated waiting times for each dish and providing their recommendations on the food as well as how to get it served quickly. Food was consistently good, and the ambience casual and relaxing. As it was a birthday party, CK and his staff went out of their way to plan and coordinate the entire sequence of events, never rushing us but always waiting by and ever quick to respond. Will definitely return to Skyve again. Thank you for the great time there (again) CK and team
5
The food is delectable coupled with the impeccable service by the staff. With the entertainment (magician walking around) , our experience at Skyve was perfect
5
Great service and food as usual. Love their chicken wings, truffle fries and luncheon chips! Great combi with drinks
5
When I am in Singapore, I eat lunch here at least once a week. Like the ambiance: cool decor indoor and outdoor. Very leafy outside. The tables and chairs are very comfortable. Quick, courteous service. Menu with eclectic choices of food. Many items gourmet. Expensive, but worth it.
5
The food was very good! Had the cod and my bff had the rosette steak, perfectly done! It was very sweet of Skyve to leave a personal birthday note and a complimentary slice of cake for her (: excellent service, there's no doubt that we will visit agai
5
Lovely service. Portions were just right. Fresh, well-prepared, authentically flavourful dishes. Love the genius and cute table mats too. :)
4
Great service, good good as always...Very attentative, looking into our needs well. We had a buddies gathering of which it includes spouses and kids..
4
Great place to have a dinner. Atmosphere was quiet and setting was comfortable. Service was very attentive
5
Celebrated my husband's birthday with friends at Skyve. The thoughtful management and staff left a note wishing my husband happy birthday on the table, and surprised us with a complimentary brownie (nicely presented with happy birthday wishes on the plate and candle). Food was excellent, and we had a wonderful time. My husband loved the Sous Vide Beef Rosette and I really enjoyed my Parmesan Beef Burger. Will definitely go back again soon.
4
If you're like me and often enjoy a late European breakfast/brunch, this is the place to come. Although in a very random location, in the middle of nowhere, with a not so great entrance, it was worth the travel from Marina Bay. Breakfast and brunch are served up until 4pm with a choice of breads and eggs. The eggs benedict was made perfectly with fresh ingredients and had good portions. The atmosphere inside looked very high end with friendly staff and a decent selection of cakes.
5
Love the oyster there try almost all flavors still natural is the best......Lobster Risotto is a must try and the appetizer Truffle Pasta is a must to share. Don't order it as main unless you have more people dinning as it can to to heavy as a main. Manhattan Chowder is equally good Staff is always Helpful and attentive. Highly recommend if you are planning for any celebration!! :)
5
Great service from the moment you walk through the door. Servers were very attentive at all times. Great duo band as well. The music was a little loud in the front hall but we had a table in the inner dinner hall, so we manage to have a conversation without raising our voice too much. Food was awesome. We had the oysters (al naturale) and beef tartare for appetizer, and for the main course, we had cod and the beef rosette. Great wine selection as well
5
Spent the perfect evening here with 11 girlfriends for a leaving get together. The food, staff & ambience were great. The menu is pretty varied & all of us were extremely happy with our choices. The waiters were very efficient & attentive & we were not rushed in any way. We sat in the comfortable casual seating area which worked very well for our group & the table was still the right height for our meals. As there is a divider between this & the normal dining table & chairs area, but you can still see through, I think it prevented any noise from our group affecting the other diners. There was a great atmosphere in the whole place & I would definitely return. Many thanks to the restaurant for the lovely surprise dessert for our friend who is leaving. It was a very thoughtful gesture
5
Relaxed and warm atmosphere - food tasty and with good presentation - presented a lovely complimentary dessert for my son's birthday
5
Love the simple note left on the table which being setup from be beginning and finally a lovely cake to top it off for a unforgettable evening. 
5
First and foremost the service is prompt and friendly. I arrived on crutches, nothing was mentioned of the injury, yet they served us a cake that exclaimed 'speedy recovery' of their on accord. The food was of incredible quality, as were the drinks; and the music and decor were very classy.I can't express how much we enjoyed this place for brunch
2
The place is nice but the flavor combinations were not my favorite. The carbonara had too much wet egg in it.
5
Service was one of the best that I have been too. Been here a couple of times for abt 2 years, and I observed that the food and service standard have been consistently good, if not better. Keep up the good work. And I hope the prices of the food do not increase when it gains even more popularity.Been here a couple of times using entertainer app, but sadly next yr it will no longer be available on entertainer. I do hope that it would continue so that I can frequent more often!Ambience is good too, with band singing on certain days. This restaurant is good for special occasion celebration, lunch, dinner with friends or for couple
3
Brunch menu had a decent variety but there's better in my own opinion. Had the pancakes but they were so thick n mushy, was disappointed
5
awesome food with great hospitality! :) best place to enjoy a weekend brunch with your loved ones..
3
I hoped that the food would be better on the second visit, but it wasn't. Four of us ordered coffee, truffle fries, steak and eggs, salmon polenta Benedict, prawn aglio olio and another Benedict set. The pasta, even with chilli flakes, was not seasoned enough. The prawns seemed undercooked and hadn't soaked up any flavour. The salmon was overcooked so the fishy flavour overwhelmed the dish (especially the polenta). The steak was average and unmemorable. The restaurant seems popular enough (it was full) - it's in an interesting, cozy location (old school house) close enough to town. If only the food were more enticing
5
Reserve your seat in the lounge area and enjoy a relaxing atmosphere and friendly customer service. Start with the chargrilled beef skewers and let the evening go from there.  
5
The service crew is awesome, especially the general manager, CK. He is quick-witted, well-planned , thoughtful and attentive guy. Will be back
5
We had the most amazing mini wedding at skyve. The staff are amazing, food is so delicious and we love it

My fiancé planned a surprise proposal for me on the 1st of November, right here at Skyve. We are impressed with the hospitality of the service crew, especially their senior manager by the name of CK. He paid meticulous attention to the slightest details and helped my fiancé in every way that he can. The ambience is perfect for an intimate occasion like this: chill and laid back. Not to mention their food that's worthy of a praise. I especially love their cod fish and brownie.

Skyve has given me a memorable wonderful birthday this year 2015. Not only have they been so attentive to our requests, needs, they were so creative to present one of the best birthday cake I had. Most importantly, every staff signed and gave me a nice birthday card! I will definitely be back again and more!!

Great atmosphere for celebration and live music was really awesome, which made this entire dinner even better with impeccable service! Would come back again on special occasions.
3
Good ambiance for bar food and drinks (they have lush sofas). However the "proper" dining area looks like a cafeteria setting. Could have been better for the proper dining area. Food choices are limited, but good, but a bit pricey
4
Love the whole day brunch which means no worries when you're late for breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful, which always ready with a recommendation or two.
3
The food and service at Skyve Bistro are impeccable. Whether these amenities are worth the bloated prices is up to the diner. They gave us small rolls that we assumed were complimentary, then charged us $5 a roll. Trust me - not worth $5. 
5
Celebrated a friend's birthday at Skyve and not only was the food deliciously yummy, the service staff were attentive and go out of their way to make us feel comfortable. One of us was not feeling well and a waitress brought a hot pot of water with lemon for her, without us even asking for it. That's what I call GEM..

Just had my solemnization at Skyve last weekend. Initially was worry that things wont go well as I planned. But I was so wrong. Everything become so good in the hands of Skyve! Just don't worry and be a handsome groom and pretty bride on your big day ;) Maggie and Jessica from event team are so responsive with emails. They will guide you well, give you ideas, their best opinion. Just trust them. You will be in very very very good hands with them around. Just when I was at the site cracking my head to display my decorations, they are cracking with you at the same time too! They know the best ;) My family and friends all love the food. And also the cozy area, making them feel so comfortable. I feel that Skyve have given me a prefect wedding with everything going on so smoothly. Just exactly the feeling I am looking for ;) After the solemnization, I even stay on for dinner with my friends to chill. Live band was awesome! A big big thank you to Skyve for helping me to create my prefect solemnization.The event team, all the staffs that help serve my guests...I may not know you but deep behind I am really thankful for everything that take place on that day <3 I don't usually write reviews.. But this is already my second review for Skyve! =

Very nice food. Beef was perfectly cooked to medium rare, pairs nicely with the Merlot. They had a birthday surprise cake for me (4x4cm), but it is an excellent gesture.Price wise, a little pricey... We used the entertainment app (1 for 1 main course), but the bill added up quite a bit. > 350 for 4 pax.4 mains (2 free)4 red wines (glasses)1 bottle red merlot2 dozen oysters2 desserts1 fries1 fried mushroomsThat is quite a bit we ordered, but bill shouldn't be that high...
5
I can't find any faults with my experience at Skyve. Upon submitting my reservation and a request for call back I promptly received a call the next day to confirm details. I was also informed of a party being held the same time of my reservation, but was assured that the party area was separated from the rest of the restaurant. True enough, they had very beautiful partition set up and we didn't feel the least bit intrusive. The food was excellent, we were informed an hour in advance of the closure of the bunch menu at 3.45pm.Looking forward to returning
5
the service of the staff was really good. they were very attentive. i made a right choice by celebrating my boyfriend's birthday there. a cake was provided as per my booking online. i was really impressed that they remembered. the atmosphere was suitable for a nice dinner with your loved ones. food was really good as well
5
was @ the restaurant with a group of friends. Our dear friend was pregnant and the staffs saw that and immediate proceed to change the chair and provide a pillow for her to rest her back. That was a really nice gesture! They even sweeten the day by giving us a complimentary dessert that reads "Congratulations on the baby!" We were really Wow by the service by Skyve! Little gestures makes our day :
4
A good change to dining experience when a magician is involved. Not only does that create entertainment, it also allows people to have something to talk about.
5
Service is always impeccable, the food is always on point and the wine list would make any aficionado a happy camper. Lovely little nook, right in the heart of town. Highly recommended

There were 3 of us and we shared 3 starters: Sous Vide Egg & Spaghettini ($18), Hokkaido Scallop ($24) and the Crab Rangoon Potstickers ($18). For the mains, we shared 2 mains: Confit of Duck Leg ($36) and the Sous Vide Duroc Pork Rack ($37). The stand out dish was the Sous Vide egg which was a combination of poached egg, iberico ham, truffle sauce over the Spaghettini. This reminded me of the ikura prawns with Spaghattini at Iggy's and the similar Spaghettini with caviar at Gunther's. The truffle flavor soaked into the ham and the pasta giving it a heavenly taste in the palatte. The other excellent dish was the main course of duck confit. This was a generous serving of 2 pieces of duck leg together with mashed sweet potato, candied brussel sprouts, beet root juice. The skin was crisp on the outside and the meat succulent and juicy.The crab dish was actually a gyoza in disguise. Fairly nice but not stellar. The pork came out a bit salty. A bit pricey for a pork dish. The scallops were nothing to shout about.There was some light entertainment provided by 2 guys on acoustic guitar. This wasn't too obstrusive for us to carry out a conversation despite being seated two tables away.What was uncomfortable was the seating. We were seated on a sofa which was out of sync with the height of the table.
4
We loved the restaurant setting, service & food. It was a lovely lunch spent either the family. Thanks Skyve.
4
This should be my 4th time at this place and the staff are always friendly. I was surprised at how fresh and sumptuous their oysters were when I first had them during my 2nd visit and have always ordered them with my subsequent visits. The freshness and succulence never fail to deliver! This round I also tried the lamb rack which was simply divine
4
Very cosy interior, nice ambience. Great team of butlers meeting your every needs with outstanding service. Very nice mouth watering food but the desserts could be improved though.
5
We were overjoyed with the quality of food, amazing wait staff and excellent flexibility of all involved at Skyve. This private dining event was truly an amazing event, all thanks to the team at Skyve.
4
Nice ambience tuck away in secluded area. Live band at night, great food & very good customer service makes the first dining experience very pleasant. There are also reasonably priced wine choice available. Definately would like to recommend & visit again.
5
We can't thank Skyve enough for going above and beyond for accommodating to my father's needs. Their wait staff made the effort to carry him down the stairs into the restaurant to get away from the haze and enjoy the atmosphere inside and to enjoy his birthday lunch. The attention by the staff is much appreciated and the food was good. Thank you for the time, effort and the care shown to us.
4
I love the interesting creativity of how oysters are plated up. We had a Lychee ‘Saketini’ Granita made of lychee & sake sorbet, seaweed “caviar”, Kilpatrick, made of lardon of bacon, worchestershire, chives... they were all so yummy. Plate down and gone in 5 mins. The location maybe looking a little dodgy on the outside, but the interior of the bistro is charming and elegant with lots of natural sunlight let in during the day through the glass paneling windows. In my opinion, Skyve as a restaurant has the perfectly casual yet still romantic enough setting for a date
4
Lovely place, we parked inside and it was a little dim and we took a while to find the place, but once we got into the restaurant, we loved the ambience! we visited on a Sunday evening and it was surprisingly nice and quiet. I had the burger which was delicious and came with toasted brioche bun and bacon jam- it went really well together but this is definitely for a big-eater, far too much for me! My fiance had the Steak which was one of the best we've had so far, it had bacon wrapped around it and was beautifully seasoned and done, each piece was juicy, tender and pink. the asparagus and mushrooms was grilled to perfection as well and was just the right accompaniment to the truffle potato mash. Amazing meal, I will come again and hopefully have room for desserts the next time. And I'm considering this place for my wedding
4
Was there on a Friday night. Nearly couldn't get a seat as we have not made any reservations. Half of the restaurant was cornered off for a private function. Food was good. Attentive waiters. One small issue - the glass where they serve water had a lipstick stain on the rim. But we discovered it almost immediately, and they changed it with apologies. Nice ambience. Good for couples as well as friends' gathering
2
The appetizer dishes ( truffle sauce pasta and crabmeat dumplings) were really nice. The main dishes like the pork and beef burger were overly salty. 
4
Nestled away from the bustling main street, Skyve is a pleasant surprise in the vicinity of Newton. A wide selection of wine to suit your individual taste, great food (try the Luncheon Chips and fried mushrooms for starters) and a welcoming staff, this is perfect for a evening with your loved one or after work drinks with your buddies. Indoor sitting is classy and laid back; outdoor is relaxing. Try the outdoor swing if the kid in you wants some fun. Live band in the evenings is great too. Note to management: Your current staff is top notch, keep them employed ;
5
The place to go for couple dinners and family celebrations. This time we celebrated our son's birthday. Nice personal touch for a signed birthday note for all the staff at the restaurant with a complimentary slice of cake. Food and service is as usual still top notch. I only wish they could add more variety to the kids menu
4
The staff was friendly and the place was nice. Food presentation was okay but the taste of the food was normal only. The bread for the salmon Benedict was too soft.
3
Decided to give Skyve a try for brunch, which was average at best and likely would not come back. The staff wasn't very knowledgable on the menu, and the seating arrangements feels like it is more of an evening music venue than a quaint weekend brunch spot. Recommend Wild Honey, PS Cafe or Jones the Grocer for a nicer weekend brunch
4
Overall nice food and great place to visit. Great customer service provided by all staff. Well done! 
1
I absolutely hate it when a restaurant cuts corners and cheats it's customers. This is such a restaurant. This restaurant advertises $9 for a half pint of beer during happy hours like it's a big deal. But if you ordered the full pint, it would have cost you just $18 at REGULAR price.Check out the picture of the beer ordered. It looks like someone else had a drink from my glass. I had to ask the wait staff, and the lady bartender reluctantly topped it up and gave a look.This horrible restaurant would cheat you for a full glass of beer. Imagine what it does to your food. I am never coming back
5
I came to Skyve with my parents for my birthday lunch, and was very impressed! The staff are absolutely lovely, friendly and welcoming from the minute you arrive and over the phone when making a reservation. Once we were seated, we noticed a personalized birthday message printed on an A4 sheet, signed by all the service staff - a cute surprise! Then while deciding what to order for dessert, I was presented with a slice of marble vanilla and chocolate cake with a berry coulis, "Happy Birthday LeeLee!" pipped in chocolate sauce on the plate and a lit candle! Again, a very sweet gesture on their part and something I wasn't expecting. The main meals were also well executed, making the entire experience enjoyable for me and my parents. I had the 'Skyving Breakfast' with brioche toast (deliciously buttery!) and poached eggs, and an apple crumble crÃªpe with vanilla gelato for dessert. Would definitely recommend this place for brunch with family and/or friends and especially if you are celebrating a special day (birthday, anniversary, etc.)
5
You can expect great quality sous vide food served in a quiet and nicely decorated bistro. Great for celebrations or just a romantic date for 2. Have had great customer service even for my pre-booking requests and enquiries. This is my second visit to Skyve. Will be back for more. P.S: Do bring back the airline chicken! Patrina
5
Enjoyed my dinner at Skyve. The wait staff were attentive and polite, and the food was tasty. we had the duck confit and the poached egg on truffle pasta. The duck confit was very enjoyable and done well, with a delightfully crispy skin, yet the meat was moist and tender. The truffle pasta was good, although it could use a little more truffle flavour. Oysters were daily priced and good. Would return again for a casual meal
5
Went to Skyve to celebrate my husband birthday, was surprised to see a lovely happy birthday note signed by the staff in Skyve. The service given is very personalized and attentive. Love the ambiance and the food is great too. Definitely will be visiting them again!
4
Celebrated my birthday with my family. Portions were big. Desserts just the right finishing touch. Service excellent.
4
The food is good. The service is good. Everything is good there. Celebrated my anniversary with my boyfriend there. The staffs were all so attentive. They even gave us a small cake for our celebration. Love this place. Made our day feel so special :
4
the beef burger is awesome. love the aroma of the beef patty and the plentiful supply of the truffle fries. the foie gras is great too. will visit again.
5
Brought a dog along with us and were treated very well, with iced water brought out for the pet and even the outdoor evaporative coolers turned on for us without us asking. A lot of attentive wait staff even though a wedding was happening inside and they were clearly busy. Also left my handbag behind when we left but were quickly called to warn us to come back, so staff are definitely to be commended for their service. To the chef, your pancakes are to-die-for! One of my favourite bistros, will definitely be back for more.
5
I was here twice in the space of a week, once for brunch and the other for dinnerOn both occasions, service was excellent. Food is good, fresh and cooked to perfection. There is a live band in the evenings, they play good songs! Well stocked wine and beer collection.I would come back here again for a special occasion.
4
Love your service... Excellent!! We were all awed by the service of your staff. Very attentive and we love the dining experience at Skyve.

This review is long over due. My wife and I chose this venue to have our Anniversary dinner based on a recommendation from a friend. We were not disappointed at all.Situated just outside the city center, the environment is quiet and welcoming. It sits back off of the street. We sat outside while Live acoustic music played inside. The dishes were engaging and well presented. We started with pork cheek sliders and oysters for Apps, followed by black pasta with Prawns and beef short rib ( we share everything). For dessert there was molten chocolate cake, and a surprise treat of Rose Macaroons! The Macaroons were unexpected... There were none on the menu, but we always ask when we eat out because my wife adores them. Word must have made it back to the chef, because we were surprised with a plate of them! They were experimenting with new flavors and we were some of the first customers to try them! I Cant emphasize how special this made us feel. The best part of all this was the cost. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced. Apps, Entrees, Desserts, 2 mixed drinks and a bottle of Malbec ( it was on special) came in just under S$250 ($170 USD) . Well below average in Singapore for a comparable meal at another restaurant. If you can't tell by now, I highly recommend this establishment.
5
we had a fantastic experience for holding our solemnisation at Skyve. The coordinator was prompt in response, friendly staff and tasty food!
3
The ambience it's cold and not very elegant. The service is slow, but especially the food is decent. I hoped was better, but It's only appearance
4
Very good food, great service, lovely atmosphere. Perfect night! We both had a 3 course diner. All the dishes where very tasty.
5
I chose Skyve for my birthday brunch and not only the food was delicious, the staff had excellent service too! And the ambience was amazing. Would definitely come again!
5
Suitable for brunch with your close friends, chatting and catching up over good food. Really nice place!
3
My friend and I went to Skyve last weekend for Sunday lunch. We had to ask to be given a proper table instead of the table with armchairs that was allocated initially which would have given us both backaches and very likely would have ended with us dropping half our lunch onto the floor. It was only when we asked that they told us that they were trying to seat us away from a large, rowdy party at the back of the restaurant.The salad dish that my friend wanted was not available that day. I ordered a sandwich with avocado in it but could not find the avocado. The service staff pointed out that I should have raised this when I got my food rather than at the end, as by then they could not verify if the avocado had been there or not. Dessert was fine - banana split was huge
5
It's always nice to go back and get the same quality of service and food. This visit must be the 6th or 7th time I've been there since the start of the year but the first time I held surprise bday party. The staff accomodated our request for a quiet corner and allowed for decorations to be up. They prepared a bday letter and had the staff sign on it. A thoughtful and appreciated gesture! Go visit if you like good food, a quiet atmosphere and a little something off the beaten track. You will not be disappointed
5
The service was excellent and we had a whale of a time! It was the perfect place for our gathering. Thank you for having us!
5
Very good service from the moment I made my reservation to celebrate my partner's birthday! Gave my partner a birthday greeting letter signed by all Staff as well as a complimentary birthday cake! Yummy food and cozy environment ;
4
Had a pleasant time catching up with frens at the bistro this morning. The staff, although young, was service-oriented and definitely helped made it a very pleasant experience for us
4
Nice cosy environment and excellence service. Like the sweet potatoes fries. I had the lobster risotto which I enjoyed thoroughly. My friend's seafood pasta was kinda sourish to him but the manager was really thoughtful and gave us 20% discount for the pasta. The other friend thought the cod fish she had was too bland.All other food we had was good, including the yummy dessert and the thoughtful act of complimentary birthday dessert for my friend and a lovely printed greetings from the restaurant.I would recommend this place for nice evening dinner and chill out with friends. Good place for birthday celebration as well, with live singer singing you the birthday song (
5
The place was located in a very exclusive location, service staffs were attentive and food served was very much to our expectations
5
Service was superb and Maggie the restaurant person in charge of my event was very helpful and efficient. The event ran smoothly!! Very good atmosphere

This marks my third visit to Skyve. I had won an Instagram contest, and was awarded with $50 worth of dining vouchers. Prior to my visit, CK, the general manager, emailed me to apologize for not being able to be present during my dinner reservation on Wednesday, 8 July, and assured me that his service team would be on hand to ensure that I would have a great dinner. I was very surprised at this warm gesture. My partner and I were warmly welcomed into the restaurant. We ordered a side of truffle & thyme fries, which were served in a steamer basket. For $12, the portion was really generous! The fries were crispy and the taste of truffle oil was strong enough work it being overwhelming. We were also impressed that the fries continued to remain crispy, even after some time. Next, we enjoyed a pizza slab of Prosciutto Ham. The pizza base was thin and crispy, and served with fresh arugula and prosciutto ham. For a small eater, this will suffice as a main dish. We next tucked into Sous Vide Grilled Duroc Pork Rack ($42). The crackling skin of the pork was succulent and crispy. The pork rack was really delectable, and served together with spinach and sweet corn, this made a great dinner. Skyve's refreshing take on a typical grilled pork dish impressed us.There's always room for dessert, so we ordered Callebaut Molten Chocolate Lava Cake. This was decent, but not extraordinary. The cake could be a little more moist, though the chocolate lava was not too bad. For $14, this was a little pricey for us.Lastly, kudos to the service staff, who were warm and attentive, constantly checking on us and refilling our glasses with water. We also appreciated the lovely ambience of Skyve, with music playing softly in the background, dim lights in the restaurant, which enabled us to enjoy a lovely date night and spend quality time with each other. We highly recommend Skyve, and will return again!
4
Skyve is one of those rare places where you can get good service and great food. Coffee is excellent too.
5
Had a birthday celebration/brunch at skyve. Service was warm and prompt. The interior was pretty although I wished they had opened up their window blinds to the outdoor greenery.
4
Lovely place we chanced on when looking for drinks one evening. Love the quiet cosy decor. Staff were accomodating and good! We had drinks, and only snacks in Luncheon Chips. The latter i found a little too salty (they had an innovative way of slicing this thin like paper chips and frying them crispy). The other thing i noticed were fans and air coolers were on. So i can imagine for lunch or when restaurant is full it may get hot inside! But if overall a nice place worth a visit
4
It was by chance that we ended up at this place. We wanted to try somewhere different for a birthday brunch and it was worth a try. The area is quiet and private.We tried the eggs Benedict, hot cakes, Skyve breakfast. Serving was generous and quality is good
5
Food was pretty delicious but the service provided by the staff needed special highlight. Due to my pregnancy, I was offered a cushion for my back without any prompting. In addition, I was also presented with a complimentary dessert by the restaurant! Staff were also attentive and came at regular intervals to fill our glasses. I'll definitely return again!

Skyve was the perfect venue to hold our wedding dinner. It did not disappoint, in fact it surpassed our expectations!Gavin & I are not fans of the traditional wedding dinners. We were looking for something different; something casual, cozy, fun, relaxing and most importantly, with good food. Skyve was THE venue. We decided on a buffet lunch for about 130 pax for our family members followed by a sit-down 4-course dinner for about 80 pax for our friends on 14 June 2015.Right from our first trip down to Skyve to recce the venue, Team Skyve impressed us tremendously. Maggie, who is in charge of Marketing and Events at Skyve, is such a darling. She is the most patient and bubbly lady around. Very prompt and efficient in addressing our five million and two questions and concerns. She gave superb advice on every little thing that we were unsure of. Maggie is THE expert in event organisation. Gavin and I appreciate deeply every little thing that she had done in the coordination & execution of our wedding. The manager of Skyve, CK, is without a doubt one of the best in his trade. He has an eye for details and is about the most observant and alert to his surroundings. This trait of his enables his customers an extraordinary experience. He has built a team that provides top notch service that all our guests were impressed with. CK also has the ability to pre-empt problems well. That speaks of his vast experience in this trade. We are very impressed with the way CK runs the floor. Gavin and I are extremely appreciative of all the little things that CK has done to make our wedding a very memorable one for us. The food! OMG. So gooooood. I won't rave about food unless they are really good so it speaks volume when I do rave. Our guests at both lunch and dinner couldn't stop giving good reviews about the food. The cod fish with cereal at lunch was DA BOMB. Our French guests at dinner loved the beef cheeks and devoured a second helping that we offered them. It was that good! Thank you amazing chefs at Skyve! We love you! But we love your food more! LOLWe engaged the band that plays at Skyve, Hafiz & Yuji, to play at our wedding dinner too. These guys are amazing! So spontaneous and fun-loving! We love their singing and the fun & laughter they brought to our wedding. We even have guests asking for their contact and wanting to engage them for future events. Thank you Hafiz & Yuji! We'll defo be back at Skyve on Saturdays to enjoy your music. We also engaged the decoration team that works a lot with Skyve, Wedding Diary. We love the decor put up by Lily and her team. Lily took time to listen to what we wanted, gave good advice and suggestions and put together decor that really helped in creating the ambience that was perfect. Thank you!In all, Gavin & I had such an amazing day at Skyve. We enjoyed our wedding tremendously! Cozy & relaxing, exactly how we wanted our wedding to be like. Thank you Team Skyve & vendors! It was puuuuurfect

Celebrated a graduation with 15 friends and enjoyed the evening at Skyve immensely! Great food and service!
5
We really liked the ambience of Skyve. The place has a laidback and relaxed atmosphere and was great for catching up with friends
5
An evening of great food and top notch service from start to finish. Great atmosphere with the live band playing in the background too. We will definitely be back. 
4
We were here because it was my hubby's birthday celebration. We came with friends & their service from arranging seats to recommending food items & serving each of them were excellent. The food were superb too. Good recommendation!   
5
Went back again and still the same consistent excellent service and good food. And now there's a magician there on Thursday nights, which is not necessary since we are already please with the evening but nevertheless entertaining.
4
Great ambience for groups or solo, good service and delicious food. When we were there, we get to enjoy the live music and singing too.
5
I went with some friends to celebrate a friend's leaving. Everything there is awesome, the waiter was very accommodating for my request to custom a good-bye dessert for a friend. Food was superbly crafted, and prices were very very reasonable. A hidden gem
4
The dining environment is really comfortable, especially for friends gathering and couples. Good variety of Food but quite a number are not available. Service are within my expectation. Staffs are quite friendly too
4
We had a wonderful birthday celebration here - the service was great, every dish we ordered (the Sous Vide Angus Rib Eye served rare as ordered, Grilled Lamb Rack, Duck Confit) looked good and tasted better. We then got a pretty cake and candle with a signed Certificate from the staff - it was a great end to a laid back evening:thanks Skyve for a great night out
5
Excellent food, World class, personalised service. Professional and very thoughtful. Staff were extremely friendly and played an important role to the success of our happy occasion. Will definitely look forward to my next chill out session there.
5
Staff were very friendly and main course and desserts are very good and nicely presented. A perfect dinning place for all occasions.

I went here for a first date and we since we wanted to have some mojito, I searched for recommended good mojito places in Singapore and shortlisted this based on the good reviews on the drinks and the ambients.My date arrived first and order a standard glass of mojito and she made me try hers before I decided to order mine but found it relatively sweet and though the alcohol was kind of in a less side and the waiter mentioned to us that they put 2 glasses of sugar so he suggested to put 1 instead. Re the alcohol he said it's a standard 90ml or something so I agreed. When my drink came, it tasted like lime juice and I even made my date try it and she too agreed that it was worst that hers and complained to the waiter about it who changed it for it. They made it better but not too my expectation like the ones I had in Fullerton Post Bar and Cube Libre. Re the food, she initially ordered the Luncheon chips for appetizer which were really crispy and good. For the mains, we go the Proscuitto Ham and Seared Grouper which were both good and tasty. Quite satisfied with the good overall
3
We arrived for brunch at 10am. Although we were the only customers at that time, the wait staff still messed up our order. My daughter had ordered the pancakes initially and was thinking of changing her order as the others in our party were placing their orders. In the end, my daughter opted not to change her order but the waitress did not key in the pancakes. She should have repeated our orders before she left the table, if she was not sure. A new waiter then began covering our table but the service level remained poor. The staff is great at clearing the dishes but not very good at listening. We asked the male wait staff to follow up our orders of coffee because our guests had to leave for the airport soon. He then asked us if we wanted to cancel our order. Perhaps it would be better to just have customers place their own orders over an iPad app because the order taking is really awful. Sadly service pulls down the dining experience in this restaurant.
5
we went to Skyve for our wedding anniversary! the very attentive staff surprised us more than twice! :)we had a wonderful evening, enjoyed the extremely delicious food and the pleasantly tuned live music from the bar area!thanks a million for the experience
4
I've been here many times and food is always good. Nice place to catch up with friends. Will definitely be back again.  
5
Egg and spaghetti, duck confit and roast pork were all excellent as was white and gold dessert. Am pretty sure the others are as good just not able to try in one seating. Better than a few "high end" restaurants that cost twice as much. Oh and the service was impeccable!
5
Food, ambience were good.All service staff were awesome!!Thank you Skyve Wine Bistro for the wonderful experience
4
We had the Spicy Kalbi Beef Short Ribs $36 and Sous Vide Grilled Duroc Pork Rack $37 which were delicious. Special mention goes to the Beef Short Ribs which had that added spice and kick
4
Persuaded to book through positive reviews on the net. Used email which was responded to promptly with a confirmed booking. (nb All the high end restaurants were booked solidly) We were surprised to enter about 20:30 to find the restaurant nearly empty!Disappointed that several dishes were not available, including the sous-vide octopus which was a trigger for the choice of venue. We settled for one entree and one main plus 2 desserts. Each was executed and presented well with appropriate flavours and textures. Service was polite and friendly but mostly needed summoning. Not like a starred venue but nothing to criticise either. Adequate wine list on the expensive side, somewhat typical across Asia
3
The food is overrated. Tasted better truffle fries in other places, and food is abit pricey.However I must really say that the ambience is awesome!
5
Was pleasantly surprised with the individual birthday greetings at our dining table. Service, ambience & food was good. Enjoyed the evening
4
Went there for Sunday brunch to celebrate friends birthday. Received a cake. Venue was spacious warm and friendly. Food and drinks were good. Lots of parking spaces
5
I came for the first time with another couple. Food was good and reasonably priced. we went for breakfast. They surprised my friend with a cake (she was pregnant) which was an unexpected but delightful level of customer service. Will be coming back
4
Service had a very friendly familiar vibe which I liked as the host made you feel like you were an invited guest to his home when you first enter. We were entertained by a magician that kept my 2 kids entertained through lunch. We ordered the Cote de Boef which we were told was good for 3-4 people but was slightly disappointed that it was actually good for 2 to share. Overall it was an enjoyable lunch. Food was good, and kids were happy and enjoyed themselves
4
We went there for friend's BD and their service is very good. The waiters always ask customer's needs and very fast service. I highly recommended this place. It must go place
5
I celebrated my sister's birthday in Skyve and I made a special request beforehand for a cake to be presented with her name. When we reached there, the staff paid special attention to the birthday girl by presenting a birthday certificate on our table with all the staff's signatures. We were very delighted to see this surprise. The food served was also delicious. Service was excellent, as details on our dining experience were taken care of. Cosy environment, recommended for anyone who want to experience causal dining in a comfortable setting
4
Great food and a reasonably priced wine list. We will be back, but will ask not to be seated in the less atmospheric back section
5
An excellent place to eat and chill out. A place to go to. Not far from a main road and quiet enough for a good conversation
5
Very cosy environment with good food and drinks and live band. Great place to chill and chit chat with your friends and loved ones awa from the bustling crowd
4
Decent dinner grub tucked away in a quiet part of Singapore away from the bustling crowds. Great for supper as well

I had my wedding solemnization at Skyve and it was amazing. All my guest said that it has a nice ambience. They provided me with the necessary settings and beautiful set-up at the alfresco area. You do have a choice to have your lunch / dinner at the lounge or dining area (with each different minimum spending), course meal / buffet menu. I chose the lounge and food was great for a buffet menu.Only down point is that price is a bit steep for a buffet menu

We booked for 6 plus 1 child but in the end we have an additional person. We asked for bigger desk, got changed but with a remark 'you did not call us to change reservation '.It was our friend's birthday, we got a cake but at entry point,we were told 'you did not mention you have a cake upon reservation so there will be surcharge '. The air cond was not working on a hot day and they only had a pathatic fan to circulate the air. Only after we complained, then they brought out a bigger fan.Overall not a pleasant experience on a Saturday

We celebrated my husband's birthday at Skyve yesterday. The service was nice, the staff signed on a personalized birthday note for my husband and provided a complimentary slice of cake.We had the sleeping oysters, which was a little overrated. I had the pork rack, that was nicely done and my husband enjoyed his steak too. The portion of food was really generous, we were both so stuffed, we had no room for desserts.The small dinning area was packed with diners, making the restaurant really noisy, so if you are expecting a romantic ambience, you will be disappointed, like me.Overall, I kind of like the place, except for the washroom. It's unisex, two cubicles for males and two cubicles for ladies, sharing a common area for washing our hands. I felt extremely uncomfortable, sharing such intimate space in this manner. It's a good place to hang out with friends, but no quite the place for a date night
4
I was there twice in one week, once for a company lunch where i fell in love with the place and the truffle fries. Went back again for a dinner where my friend was the performing act! The reviews are right their burgers are really pretty good, including the sliders! Desserts were pretty decent, big portions would be ideal to share
5
Went to this restaurant for a dinner and birthday celebration recently. The service right from the point of reservations to the dining experience was simply excellent! For appetizers, we tried Chilean oysters and Blue mussels broth with fries. The oysters were very fresh. The mussels were slightly smaller than expected though the sauce was simply delicious. For mains, I would recommend Spicy Kalbi Beef Short Ribs, Confit of Duck Leg, Sous Vide Grilled Duroc Pork Rack and Grilled Whole Boston Lobster. For desserts, we tried the chocolate lava cake with salted caramel ice cream and was also given a complimentary chocolate birthday slice. Both were nicely decorated with birthday wishes! Overall service was excellent and attentive. Very good experience though the location is slightly off the usual crowds and malls
4
Great outdoor atmosphere and decent prices. Food is not bad. pets are allowed. Service was excellen
4
What a nice place Skyve is! The ambience is relaxed, service is fast and with a smile and the food is excellent quality and is made up of good sized portions. Try the lobster with spaghettini. Excellent.We will definitely be coming back
5
Like many others have mentioned, Skyve is indeed a hidden gem. Although there are signs placed outside the compound, you may find it a little hard to locate the restaurant. However, I can confidently say that the entire dining experience is well worth the search! Once we found the place, we were warmly greeted by CK and his team and ushered to be seated in the lounge area. Food was delicious and prices were decent. My partner and I were absolutely delighted with the service provided by the staff who were extremely polite and professional. On the whole, Skyve is a wonderful place to dine at, my partner and I will definitely be back for more

I like the idea that the restaurant uses an online system to allow easy self-reservation. I called in to make reservation and received an email confirmation 1 second after I put down the phone with the restaurant staff. I was able to make amendments to the reservation online without calling the restaurant. *thumbs up*We shared a caesar salad which was great except that the hard boiled egg was too cold, it seemed like the egg was pre-cooked and stored in a fridge. The egg was rather tasteless too.My husband ordered lamb shank. According to him, the lamb shank was tender and flavourful. I ordered Norwegian Salmon Fillet with poached egg. The waiting staff informed that I could change the poached egg to something else (e.g. scrambled egg) so I changed the poached egg to scrambled version. The salmon skin was crispy and the salmon fillet was nicely browned.If I have to pick on something, that would be the scrambled egg. I didnt like the texture of the scrambled egg. It was grainy and tasteless.We ordered an Apple Crepe dessert. The apple was too sour and the serving of the gelato was just a mouthful. Not so nice, in my opinion.But all in all, it's worth a visit
5
Skyve is a hidden gem! Tucked away in the compound of a old Secondary School, the environment was nice, spacious and quiet. Great for chilling out and a nice dinner. Parking is easy and the location is minutes away from Orchard Road. We arrived at 5pm, which was too early for dinner so we decided to have tea and snacks. They served Gryphon Tea which I loved. We ordered the fried bunashimeji mushrooms and the sweet potato fries served with wasabi mayo. Both were served in cute dim sum basket and were very delicious. For dinner, we ordered the Pan Seared Grouper and the Duck Confit. The Pan Seared Grouper was served with a small portion of risotto. The Duck Confit was excellent. Crispy skin with tender meat that falls off the bone with no gamey taste. I highly recommend this dish. Service was impeccable. The staffs were polite and professional. Our glasses of water were never kept empty as they just kept refilling it. Would recommend this place to my friends
4
Good food, Good ambiance, although took us a while to locate the restaurant, otherwise it is a good experience
4
Nice place but parking information not clear. Faulty electronic gantryI sat at the lounge area, it got warmer and warmer along our 2 hrs brunch, air conditioning can be improve
5
Parking easily available. Sous vide eggs always perfectly done but would be better if the eggs were organic free- range. Perhaps there can be an option for that on the menu
4
Food was delicious, ambience was amazing. Live band is not too loud despite being indoor and they played well too.

Hubs and I went to Skyve for the first time as I had heard Abt it from some friends. We were there for a late dinner and being our first time there, we actually got slightly lost and had difficulty locating the restaurant, as it is actually located inside what probably used to be a school in the past. Signages could have been clearer. But apart from that initial hiccup, the rest of the evening went well. Being a Sunday night at abt 8pm and quite tucked away in a pretty obscure place, the restaurant wasn't very crowded, which was good. (Maybe abt 4-5 other tables of diners, apart from us.. And a couple of others who arrived after us) We had the truffle mushroom soup, duck confit, pork rack and the tiramisu. Service was excellent and the waiter kindly offered to split the mushroom soup into two portions for us as we said we wanted to share it. Our mains were wonderfully executed and flavorful. Desert was also exquisite. It helped that we also had the Entertainer app which we could use to offset one of our mains (the cheaper one). So our entire meal cost us $74. Will definitely be back again.
4
The staffs are very cheerful and greeted us with a warm smile upon arrival. The staffs were also attentive as they refilled our cups the moment it went half empty. The food portion was just right and the flavor was not too overpowering. The lounge area looks more cosy than the normal dining area though
5
We have dined here a number of times. We particularly love this place in the evenings as it's quieter than orchard area and parking is always easy.On weekends they have an acoustic band that plays nice background music and you can still have a conversation without raising your voice.The service is pretty good. Not always polished but they try. The food is very good for western food in SG. We definitely recommend the well-priced Lobster with pasta, Lamb Shanks, Steak, and finish off with Tiramisu or warm choc cake. We will happily come back again just to relax, unwind, listen to some nice music and good food without any parking issues even on the weekend
5
Wanted to find a place to dine with group of friends and have live band and found this place and fell in love with it. Had my b'day celebrated here last Sat and their service were surprisingly thoughtful in their own special ways. There were many waiters & waitresses and they're attentive and experienced. Seeing that I have a little baby bump, they offered a cushion to place at the back of my chair to make it more comfy. There was a b'day greeting "cert" signed by the staff and they also surpise you with a personalized cake at an appropriate timing. I doubt anyone from my table gave them the cue to do so. We even had a group photo taken at the bar counter, with a pose suggested by CK that turned out pretty fun and cute. Thanks CK for being the photographer & suggesting the location and pose :)The food ordered was nice too. Had the truffle fries, wings, snapper and chicken. Snapper was grilled to my liking, crispy and yet juicy, but the portion was not as filling as compared to the chicken dish. Hubby prefers the chicken as it's not dry and is boneless thigh.For those with pets, you can also dine here, but al fresco
5
dearest Skyve service team,there's no compliment great enough for me to write or type for that matter. But I will attempt to highlight some of the positive feelings and vibes that I have felt in this placeFrom the moment I placed the enquiry to the follow up on each of my requests was so impeccable. I knew from the start that this team at Skyve would be something that would not fail me.I was planning to propose to my girlfriend of 11 years and the team were so willing and ready to assist with this special event. I even forgot that i would probably need someone to take photos for me, the manager that evening CK was so willing and had some staff cover him so that he could assist me that evening. Thank you so much CK.Prior to the dinner, Jessica who assisted me with the reservation was very helpful and was extremely patient. The service team that night was also wonderful, coming at all the right moments to do the table service, filling of water, clearing of plates etc.This service is really something special. I would definitely come back again, and I wish Skyve all the best. A truly beautiful restaurant and impeccable service. A really BIG thank you to the entire team! :)- Clarenc

You can choose to sit inside in the restaurant section or in the lounge area (with retro sofas) or out side on a raised patio complete with fans and music. This is a great find, it is out of the way a bit - a short walk from Newton MRT.They stock good wines at good prices (for SG). The food is just delicious, whether it is brunch, afternoon nibbles or dinner. If you plan to go on the weekend, phone ahead and book a table. The staff are very accommodating.I have eaten here on more than one occasion and Skyve does not disappoint
4
I brought my boyfriend there to celebrate his birthday and everything went well from the service, to food and to serving out his birthday cake, which was on the house. There was even a greeting paper signed personally by the staff at Skyve, wishing him a happy birthday, that was laid on the table as we arrived. My boyfriend had the pork rack, which the both of us love. The rub on the pork rack was thorough and even infused in the meat! I had the beef short ribs but the kalbi glaze falls short in comparison to the pork rack. The staff are really friendly and are attentive to even the minute detail such as personally smsing me to let me know that the live band would be ending their first session soon and hence, it was time to bring out the birthday cake so they could sing for us. It was a wonderful evening and I will definitely return
5
I went for brunch with my pregnant cousin, her husband and my mum.Not only did they anticipate that she needed the ladies, they told her where it was even before she could ask them! And at the end of our meal when we asked for the bill we received a little complimentary brownie to share with "Congrats on the baby" written in chocolate.On our way out, a lady and her friend were din in with their dog and the dog was given a bowl of water! I'm won over And so was my cousin. She is now planning her baby's first month celebration there
4
the place is secluded from outside.you need to have car or taaxi to dine here. the ambience is good and food taste good
4
Visited the restaurant with my female friends. Quiet location, good service, albeit Main course is a bit expensive. Dessert platter is a must try! Girls will like it.
4
I brought my hubby there for his birthday celebration and we had a great time there! Ambiance was romantic and the restaurant was spacious, not cramped like some. We had a ribeye and a lamb shank. Hubby commented that it was good. Staff were attentive and was constantly checking on us to ensure that everything was good. We would definitely go back again
4
I have previously made arrangements with the manager at Skyve before going down as I wanted to give my best friend a surprise for her birthday.We were greeted by friendly staff at the restaurant upon arrival, and they served my best friend her "surprise birthday dessert" after she was seated. Every staff there has actually made the effort to sign off on her birthday greeting "card".Food were great as well! Waited quite awhile for the food though, due to many people that day. Need to have a carpark outside! If you are looking for somewhere to celebrate your special day, Skyve is highly recommended! Will definitely return again
4
went there for supper on a saturday. there was a wedding party so had to move to the tables in the back. the area in the front is nicer and more cozy. the starters are great and a lot of meat dishes prepared sous vide
5
Hv been here a few times. The service of the staff has been consistently good. Both the service and food were excellent
4
Truffle fries is the best. Ambience awesome. For more reviews visit my blog https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/qiuxue?ref=bookmark (
4
Very attentive staff and good service.We ordered a sous vide pork ribs that was a tad tough but otherwise overall taste was good. The camomile crÃ¨me brulee with lychee sorbet was a perfect way to end the meal. we would come back to try other dishes and would recommend the place to be a get together venue for its settings and ambience
3
My partner and I wanted to have their lobster and we were told that they wont sell us any because there is a lobster set meal sold the day after our dinner and they told us they don't have anymore lobster. Obviously they do have lobsters and we have asked repeated asked if we could have 1 but our request was declined which is a disappointment. The waiter did not tell us that lobster is off the menu and why did the kitchen ask their staff to lie that they have run out of lobster?I enjoyed the food but I dont feel right when pple lie.
5
Some may find the location odd but we found it well and it had great parking space along with a great ambiance. The name says its a wine bistro and it truly lives up to the selection well!! Very attentive service staff BUT the best thing has to be the food. We had brunch so usual eggs ben (made very well) & THEN the Kurobuta Pork Cheeks Burger - 6 hr Braised Pork Cheeks in Balsamic Vinegar ; which melts! Amazing
4
Abit pricey good ambience and food service can be improved. On the whole good place for dates And anniversary
5
I have been to Skyve many times, and the food is consistently amazing! They have a wonderful menu with many delicious options, and their cocktails are really great as well! I highly recommend the Duck Confit and the Dark Cherry Mojito. They used to make the most amazing sous vide pork belly, that was honestly the best dish I have ever had, but they took it off the menu for some reason. Skyve, if you read this review, PLEASE bring the pork belly back!
4
From the outside this restaurant doesn't look much and it was deserted when we went but the food blew me away. Very interesting use of complimentary flavours, well cooked, well presented and very tasty.The service is also excellent. Not sure about the name though "skyve" as in skive?Worth going for the food alone
4
Lovely little restaurant and bar which is a bit difficult to find (better google a map beforehand and come by cab, no parking close by).The retro interior looks great and offers you two options, lounge and restaurant. The menu has very funky titles that are inspiring. Food is great, don't miss the desserts as they are really good.Strangely, this place closes pretty early at 10:30 pm and staff will make this obvious when they bring the lights up and do a full clean of the toilet area blasting it with water.You can stay a little bit longer in the outdoor area and enjoy the swing ;-
3
Food was mostly good, but the apple crumble wasn't very fantastic. Try the sticky date pudding instead. Service was overall okay, although one of the staff members was visibly annoyed by something
5
I'm so glad that I've chosen Skyve as my Solemnization Venue, itâ€™s a great place to held a intimate and cosy wedding or Solemnization and not to mention the foods are great as well!A big thanks to Maggie and team for helping us out all along
4
We are regulars at Skyve. It took a while but we have finally found that place to go in the evenings when you just don't want to cook but not are you organised to go out. We sit in the casual bar area and share plates. The wine is delicious and well priced, And the service is good (no, truly I mean it). Skyve has a lovely relaxed atmosphere and it's usually quite busy. On the weekends there's live music which we really enjoy. You can also eat outside on the deck if you like which we have done successfully with larger groups. I'm not so wrapped with the back formal seating area. I find it sterile and canteen like and the chairs uncomfortable but for a party with heaps of kids I think you would use this space. Overall rating reflects that I think a slightly more extensive food menu would be good thing
4
We looked for brunch recommendation in Trip Advisor and we found this restaurant. It is a little bit hidden but easy to find. There was this guy that recommended us the signature dishes in the place and it was all good. The best thing definitely was the Duck. Crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside. We also tried the Pork Hamburger which was something different and it was great!My wife ordered a fresh and just squeezed green apple juice that was delicious.The atmosphere is nice, just take a look at the photos.
4
Fantastic service by the host (Mr Shaiful) who had taken my telephone requests patiently and ensured that everything was in order!The food was quite delicious and the ambience was fabulous. Will surely return to try out other dining times.
5
Service here is fantastic. Staff are attentive and come across as really genuine. Pork cheek burger taste great
5
My colleagues and I wanted to have a nice dinner with our boss on 21 Nov, fri night and decided on Skyve based on the good reviews given. Knowing CK personally also helps in my decision to try out this place. ^^The actual experience was great right from the moment we entered the door. CK and his team was very welcoming. The first impression of the place was nice and cosy. I also love how smooth the reservation was made online with instant confirmation.We were showed to our table and service was prompt and attentive throughout. When we asked for recommendation, our server was able to give recommendations since it was our first visit. Food ordered were Chilean Oysters, Skyver's Wings, Funghi'ed Out pizza, Truffle and Thyme Fries, 2 main courses - squid ink pasta and Sous Vide Grilled Duroc Pork Rack and the Callebaut Warm Chocolate Molten Cake. Special mention to the Skyver's Wings and Truffle fries, they were great! The warm chocolate molten cake was a little disappointing thou (slightly dry) Of course, not forgetting the beer, Happy hour from 5-7pm and a live acoustic band every friday and saturday night from 8-11pm.We had a wonderful and memorable time at Skyve. I will be sure to make a return visit
5
I came once before to this restaurant attending my friends wedding. I find the environment is very suitable for couple as it is far from town and quiet and kind of romantic just nice for the couple to spend a special dinner night. Brought my bf to skyve for his birthday celebration and we love the place, food is nice service fabulous we had a free brownie cake and have the attention of waiter lost of time. Service level is 5 out of 5 but of course it comes with price. The main course price here is above average. We ordered boston lobster spag for sgd49, like this dish the most but will be great if the lobster could be bigger. Overall it's a good experience and will come again.
4
I had the fish which was light and good. Ambience was relaxing. After dinner, we requested to switch to the lounge area for desserts and chats. The restaurant promptly agreed and helped us shift. And no, we did not have to move our glasses of water. They gave us new ones
5
My third visit to Skyve was not a disappointment . This time we just wanted a simple light meal and drinks. The home made pizza is very good andc their is a wide selection of choice. Desert and cheese board + wine selection all very good.See you next time. Andrew

I definitely agreed that you need to be attentive in service line but at the same time, you shouldn't let your customers find it intrusive. Servers are walking around, to check whether you have finished your meals or do you need any help. But they are way to close to the table while walking and we do not feel comfortable with them able to overheard our conversation. I think It will be better if the servers can observed the guests from a distance and check them out once in a while but not every 5 mins. I feel pressurized that I need to quickly finished my food and indeed, the moment I have finished, they came straight away and ask permission to clear our plates. With this act, I felt that did they want me to leave asap? I feel that Skyve can do better. Food is not bad. Atmosphere is great. I will come back again, for the food sake. But should they continue to be this attentive the next round I am back, I may not return again. I believe both food and service are equally important
5
Proposed to my girlfriend at Skyve. Extremely comfortable and romantic ambience and setting, with the help of the lovely helpful crew
3
Place was warm and we had water dripping on us from the aircon, food was slow and not as nice as previously visited standards have dropped and expensive
5
all our courses from start to finish were excellent. Special mention going out to the duck confit and the snickers dessert that was both innovative and well executed.
5
First impression was the service and the atmosphere was awesome it was my 3rd year anniversary with my girlfriend ! Delicious food
5
The brunch menu is creative. I had seared tuna on toast - excellent (and I have finally found somewhere in Singapore that knows how to toast bread!) Went back for dinner
4
I see a lot of reviews mentioning the service here. Keep in mind this is Singapore, and the service is erratic everywhere as they are still getting the gist of customer service in this city. To be honest though, I found the service at Skyve better than other places in Singapore. The staff was welcoming, friendly and did not take too long. The food was excellent - we went there for brunch and the pancakes are simply amazing, truly some of the best pancakes we've ever had. Value for money is good, especially compared to some other brunch places in this city. Note: as with all the popular brunch places in Singapore, go early to avoid crowds and noise - we went there a bit before 11 and it was quiet and pleasant. Overall, Skyve was a great experience. We live right next door so we'll definitely be back with friends

My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Skyve. The place was a little tricky to find but once we got there, it was immediately obvious that the atmosphere was very cosy and quaint. The service was great and the crew even prepared a letter which wished us a happy anniversary! We ordered Crab Rangoon Potstickers for starters: the filling was delicious but overall the dish was a little oily for my liking.For main courses, we ordered the Confit of Duck Leg and Sous Vide Grilled Duroc Pork Rack. The duck confit was very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside which was a huge hit with us both. The sweet potato mash which accompanied the dish complemented the duck perfectly. The pork rack on the other hand was not quite on the lean side and my husband had to trim the fats off the rack. We ordered tiramisu for dessert but it was maybe 2.5 or 3 out of 5. The cake wasn't as soft or moist as we expected it to be. The staff however gave us a complementary brownie with 'Happy Anniversary' written in dark chocolate at the side. That was a really nice gesture and needless to say, we are very happy with the service. Overall, I would say that it is worth giving this place a try
5
Skyve has a welcoming vibe to it. The setting is perfect for a nice meal and for private functions. Service at Skyve is excellent with staff showing attention at the right time, definitely not hovering around. Meals wise, a variety of options are available. Food is aesthetically-pleasing and of decent quality. I would visit Skyve again to try the other items on their menu and to 'skyve'.
4
Tucked away in Windstedt Road, Skyve provides the perfect ambience for a casual post-wedding Hi-tea reception: quaint and intimate, backed up with great food and service. We particularly loved the mini beef cheek burgers, truffle & thyme fries and cuban coffee tiramisu. Service, while laid-back and friendly, remained professional and attentive. Special thanks to Maggie and Chun Kiat for overseeing the event and helping to create such wonderful memories for us
3
Food was very mediocre but it has a pretty extensive menu. Maybe it was the things we ordered tht wasnt good. Service was excellent and ambience is cosy and quiet
3
There's a lot to like about Skyve... it's a concetp (Skiving) that's been taken right the way through all that they do, without becoming overly wearisome or twee.The space is light, airy and bright with lots of neat design touches.The service is attentive, without being intrusivePlus it's not bad valueThe menu though is worryingly large (too many items on a menu always makes me suspicious) and dishes do vary enormously in quality, presentation and portion size (the kid portion fish n fries being bigger than any adult main course)So while truffled eggs and sashimi salad got thumbs up, nicoise salad was mean with the tuna and pretty average otherwise.Truffle flavoured oil seems to be a little too favoured too (we had a 4 year old, a 3 year old and a 1 year old with us - their dishes all had truffle oil... really?)Ultimately though it's a nice concept, a lovely space and a great atmosphere... you won't regret coming here, you'll just leave thinking that perhaps as much attention should have gone into the foo
5
The ambience and food were great but more importantly, the team at Skyve was what made our wedding celebration a memorable evening for our friends, my wife and me. Super professional and attentive, the team at Skyve were the perfect hosts
3
Good ambiance and brunch menu, had a decent time except my pizza took WAYYY too long to be prepared. What's up with that
4
Loved the options for the Snoozy Brunch and over-ordered as usual. We got the Salmon Polenta Benedict and the Skyving Breakfast with Scrambled Eggs, with a side order of truffle fries (what can I say, I saw a plate go by and had to have it!)The servings were very generous, and the polenta was a nice option to soak up all that runny egg yolk, Would have loved slightly crispier edges to the polenta. The Angus sausage was lovely and the combination of mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and greens was perfect. Loved the toasted brioche (I am such a carbo queen) but wished the scrambled eggs were a little creamier. All in all, it was cosy, quaint, had great food and a lovely ambience to chat and hang out for a while. And if there hadn't been another couple parked on the swing set, I would have been hogging it all afternoon
5
The moment I walked in, I fell in love with the atmosphere. It was very welcoming and warm, with attentive service staff to address our needs, and the moment the food was served (squid ink pasta), my eyes lit up!it was awesome, it is worth the visit!
3
Food was great. But found it hard to carry on a conversation when the live music (although good) was so loud. Was straining to hear my friends. This is a restaurant, not a club.
5
I have had a few brunches at Skyve & have always enjoyed the experience. Keep up the good work & keep delighting
5
Had a great dinner @ Skyve with my friends some time back. I called to make a reservation to celebrate my friend's birthday, the person who pick up my call is very friendly, and even check with me any special occasion and if I require any assistance before I even mention to him. And he offered to do a special dessert (some pudding) with my friend's name written on the plate for the birthday boy which turned out to be very yummy. And all the different food we had ordered turn out really delicious. Highly recommended
5
Skyve serves up good food, provides good service. In addition, Skyve is located at a nice quiet private location. Good place to visit
3
We've not been back for a year. Food was acceptable. Drinks were acceptable. Wait staff are still just as friendly and courteous. They need to do something with the acoustics. It was terribly loud. Didn't help that neighboring table was speaking at the top of their voices. Strange table manners. 
5
I stated that I was celebrating a birthday when I made the online reservation. When they called to ask for my friend's name, I thought it would just be a complimentary cake. But there was actually a letter to wish my friend as well. Although a simple gesture, it was very much appreciated and reminded of our times in US. The waitresses were also really amicable. Plus great food and great ambience on top of all these. :
4
Was my dad's birthday - nice touch to receive a personalized "card" signed by the staff. Service was attentive throughout. Food-wise, the pork rack is superb. Atmosphere with the live band was unfortunate to be marred by a large family group comprising many young children at the table behind us
5
We went to Skyve for our daughter's 16th birthday. The place has a cool vibe to it. The service at Skyve was top notch. We have not had better service in Singapore. Our food was delicious. The menu had lots of options. One of our kids wanted something different from the menu and they were happy to oblige. They had a lovely treat for our daughter for her birthday. We are looking forward to our next visit to Skyve!
5
Had my birthday celebration with a few close friends at Skyve. My friends enjoyed the food very much especially the fresh oysters. Though the price is not cheap but quality of food is worth it. Love the cosy ambience too
4
Nice quiet area and surroundings. Went to do a Sunday lazy brunch. Place is not overtly crowded and the food served is great. Coffee can be further improved however but it was not too shabby nonetheless
4
I have visited Skyve 3 times now and every time I leave a happy and satisfied customer. Every meal we have had has been delicious. Service is one of the best in Singapore and when it comes to the $$, you guaranteed good value for money. Cant wait to go back there :-
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the food especially the pizza; it was really tasty! Service wise, everyone was attentive with tip top service
5
Skyve is a place that prides itself on good service, great food, and a fantastic space. Suitable for a gathering with great company any time of the day whether it is for a lazy breakfast, energetic lunch/brunch or a chill out dinner with drinks. The Kurrabuta Pork Cheek Burger is a must try
4
Decent food that is reasonably priced. Service has improved from the early days thankfully. Great place to catch up with the girls
5
Ricotta pancake was a standout. Prawn aglio olio was wiped out in no time and we had to order another. Sashimi salad, skyving breakfast, burrito were all good
4
Thinking it was new to Singapore, but shocked stunned to discover has been open for over a year, this is a superb hideaway brunch venue, away from larger expatriate crowds. Good menu, with something for most, reasonably priced, and a lovely decor to relax in
5
My family and I had a memorable and lovely meal over the weekend at Skyve! Service was top notch and we were all impressed with the quality of the food served. Thank you CK and your wonderful team for making this a joyful and yummilicious dinner for us all! Thank you for sharing with us your reccomendations and great insights on how the dishes are prepared! It's gonna be tough to find another restaurant in SG with similar service and quality food to match Skyve's. We'll defintely be back! Great place for romantic dinner/ gatherings
5
Was over at Skyve for dinner - actually a friend's wedding dinner - this was 2 weeks ago but i still remember the meal vividly.Starters - some kind of miso soba with ikura or fish roe. The dish was fresh, al dente, with the ikura putting up perfect resistance to each bite before bursting forth with briny umami goodness.Mains - i had Wagyu steak which was perfectly timed despite having to prepare multiple platters for everyone at the event. The doneness and pink hues were as you would expect from an establishment like Skyve.Dessert - was the highlight for me - their own rendition of the Snickers Bar. Decadent chocolate praline with layers of bitter chocolate, paired with caramel, and of course great Vanilla ice cream. They were very generous with the ice cream.Service - was attentive and prompt, headed by some dapper fellow with some cutting edge hair-do. Cannot remember his name though. Perhaps it was Charles or something like that

Food was not bad. Parking was easy. But they had stools to sit on to eat which wasn't so good for the back. Even then, will probably be back.
4
I'm planning for my R.O.M and Skyve is one of my shortlisted place for this faithful event. I must say, they provide good food and superb service. Friendly people. Nice and cosy place
5
A very child friendly place, good food and excellent service. Totally enjoyable experience. Will revisit

was genuinely surprised when I stepped inside for lunch after my church service which was the building next door. I was greeted by a rush of air-con which was great. I had foie grass and short ribs which were just wonderful. Hope to be able to go again

To me, the best dining experience has to go way beyond that of the selfish "I want the best tasting food" mantra. Having said that, the food was splendid, of course. That's already nailed in stone. However, my intention here is to share the overall experience.Skyve Wine Bistro is a like a sanctuary - it is like a place which feels like home. The service, spearheaded by CK, feels so genuine, non-rehearsed, and personal that I feel like family. Food is a way to connect with people - across cultures, amongst friends, new friends, family and so on. What Skyve provides is impeccable food that is not astronomically priced, and an all-round environment plus service experience that makes you want to stay there, go back there, and organise events there with people who matter to you. Even when we sang our mum's birthday song, the 10+ other people who were sitting beside us clapped and sang along spontaneously. And no, they were not "ang moh", in case you doubt the spontaneity of local Singaporeans. You really just need the right, homely environment to nurture such spontaneity in all people :) So there you have it, a good sign that this place is non-pretensive. The food is real, the value is real, the service is real, the experience is real.Skyve is open to all, but it is like a home - it is real :
5
I am a regular at Skyve, It's tucked away in a nice quiet area around Newton and serves great food. Service is fantastic and the space is suitable for catching up with family and friends. Absolutely children-friendly as well! In terms of food, make sure you have the Kurrabuta Pork Cheek Burger (only available at lunch or brunch)
5
My family and I chose to dine at Skyve to celebrate our mother's birthday and I would say that she was not the only one who was pleasantly surprised that night! The first thing that struck us all was the great attention to details - from the decor/menu to every aspect of the service we received. CK was absolutely warm, chatting with all of us and giving us excellent recommendations while still leaving us time to look through their selection of food and drinks! The mussels and spaghettini (I think that was the name) we had for starters were superb; they were well flavoured and we could taste the quality of the ingredients. For mains we had the pork, duck leg, squid ink pasta, beef ribs and cod - all of which were just amazing. The skin of the duck leg was so crisp and tasty and the cod was sooooo well done. The two vegetarians of our party were so very pleased with their vegetarian pizza, salad and pasta - a very rare occurrence considering how some places do not even have much vegetarian options or do not accommodate vegetarian requests. The service was needless to say top-notch. The staff were very courteous and attentive, which really allows you to relax and have a nice meal. All in all I would say that the service definitely impressed us and we know that we will visit Skyve again, not just for the marvellous food but for the entire wonderful dining experience. Also, special thanks to CK for the special arrangements! Mommy Lee was very happy with everything!Lee FamilyP.S. Even the butter for the bread was served on a chilled plate

We visited skyve again after we held our wedding there in April 2014 and made reservations with maggie the wedding co - ordinator to visit again.As we walked in the staff greeted us warmly and cheerfully with smiles on their faces.The food was wonderful and is always consistent! We loved the short ribs, foie gras, cod fish and pork belly ( although it seemed to have changed since the first time we tried it?? Still good though!)! They had a live band who also made the effort to sing a song for us and to welcome us back.We love visiting skyve because of the wonderful and consistent service and food. It's amazing how you keep all your staff motivated and offering such wonderful svc all the time.Thumbs up and we will be back

it was dinner with a close girlfriend of mine. she arrived early & noticed i booked a table at e "dining area", she preferred e "lounge area" where the live austic duo band was performing..the guy who welcomed us did sm arrangements for us & we had our seats near the band although it was gona be a full seating(fri night)...very sweet of him...food was tasty, we had mussels, a pizza & the beef tartar...a jug of mojitos & a jug of sangria...excellent.band was great! somehow we felt cozy w the beautiful songs! we cant help but singing along(w or w/o knowing the lyrics)......
5
Melly and I would like to thank Skyve for catering for our wedding at Sculpture Square. You guys did a marvellous job and pulled off the event perfectly. Our guests were well taken care of and we were told they loved the food. Maggie, thank you so much for your professionalism, everything went smoothly from the setup, placement, handling of waiters/waitresses to our guests etc. We are very grateful and glad to have Skyve cater to our wedding. Once again, thanks a million
4
The service staff were attentive and friendly. Food was good and we were not disappointed. Generally the ambience was pleasant and cozy. Having a band is a great idea but what would have been appreciated was some breaks between the singing. It went on endlessly and it was far too loud for decent conversation to take place. We had to project our voices above the volume of the music to be heard. Overall, it was a lovely evening. I would definitely go back again and bring friends too
4
I've been to Skyve several times and the experience I had never fail to meet my expectations. The service was exceptional! A lovely place to chill and catch up with friends. The sticky date pudding is highly recommended
4
Had a wonderful dinning experience at Skyve Wine Bistro in conjunction of celebrating my friend birthday. made a special request with the management team for the bday surprise. very helpful restaurant manager CK called me and advise me on the arrangement. actual day itself, the crew is very helpful and provided with good service. thanks you for making the night for so perfect for us. appreciated !! food is nice.. ambience is cosy. worth going !! Thanks Skyve !!
4
We were seated almost immediately upon reaching. Great hospitality and service. Food and dessert was great! Thank you
5
Skyve has always been a place for me to catch up with my close friends. It's located at a rather quiet corner but accessible by MRT (with a short walk). The ambiance is nice and the restaurant is spacious. I recommend the breakfast menu! I will definitely be back again to try out the dinner menu and of course, its array of wines and cocktails
4
Contrary to a lot of reviews here. Went there with a party of 6. Only disappointment was no oysters and mussels for the day. We had the beef tartare, foie gras, salad, crab meat appetisers. Beef and foie gras were wonderful. With nice portions. Crab meat could have used more seasoning but had really fresh ingredients. Salad had a hefty share of prosciutto ham. The main courses were large portioned and all were great. We had the tenderloin, lamb rack, pork shoulder, beef rib, squid ink pasta and the Boston lobster. My personal favourite was the squid ink pasta. A large prawn and a huge portion of squid. And really tasty pasta. The tenderloin was soft n really deliciouslyWrapped with bacon. Didn't have anymore stomach space for dessert. Overall was a pleasant experience. Will come back. Compliments to the assistant chef because from what we understand the head chef wasn't ard yesterday. :)
4
Was there 2 times this month. Food was nice. Service was great. I like the decor too. Will be back again soon
5
We booked Skyve for a group dinner knowing from past experience that they can provide great food, great service and overall .....an excellent experience.They delivered all of the above. The food across all courses was innovative, fresh, hot and delicious.The service was friendly, prompt and the team were always engaged with what we needed.The layout of the restaurant allowed us to have drinks together first and then use a corner so we didn't disturb all the other diners.Whether dinner for two, for a family or for a group I highly recommend the team at Skyve!
4
Been to Skyve two times so far and we always have good experience with the food each time we go there! First time we went for brunch and I had steak sandwich for the main. It was really good! For the dessert, we had crêpe with vanilla ice-cream, this was great! The crêpe was really thin and it went well with the ice-cream! We went for dinner for the second visit. This time we had the mini burgers for appetizer. The beef was really juicy. The size wasn't really "mini" though. We then shared a plate of lobster pasta. I really like this! The lobster was fresh, tender and juicy! We really enjoyed the food at Skyve !
5
when my friends suggested that we go to skyve for brunch, I was very reluctant because of its location. However, im glad I did. the ambience was sooooo smoothingly nice and the service was top notch. Staff were very attentive and friendly. I had the kurobuta pork cheeks burger and wow, it was really good. this is a place that I would definitely be going again and again. Thank you to all at skyve for making the visit so wonderful.
5
We really enjoyed our brunch at Skyve. The food was delicious and the place is gorgeous. It has a nice local atmosfere far from Singapore busy center or aseptic food malls
3
Skyve has a great location and nice decor, unfortunately the food and service doesn't quite follow. Perhaps because of the private group, the staff wasn't very attentive. We've ordered just salads but for S$19 Salad Bowl it was really dissappointment - Cold Storage lettuce, pre-cut tomatoes (maybe 5 cherry tomates for whole bowl) an 3 slices of parma ham... Hope the warm food or brunch is better
4
The greeneries in the Skyve's compound made us forget that we are actually in a city. That itself was a good start to our brunch in November 2013. We ordered:- Skyve Sous Vide Eggs Benedict- Croque Madame- Clam Chowder- Kurobuta Pork Cheeks Burger- Funghi’ed Out PizzaThe eggs were beautifully runny, the pizza had generous topping, and everything that was served just smelt heavenly, including our neighbour's BBQ Pork Spare Ribs. I highly recommend the Kurobuta Pork Cheeks Burger as it was DOWNRIGHT AMAZING. The crispy bun was delightful, and went very well with the juicy and tender pork cheeks. The fries were the ultimate comfort food. The only downside was the Korean sauce which was a redundant addition to this already superb dish. The sauce tasted odd and we hardly touched it.I wouldn't mind going back there again for a weekend brunch
5
This is the 4th time I was back at Skyvve for my husband's birthday. The food was awesome. All the times I have been there the food has been so good. Well done!! Would like to come by for brunch next :
4
Came here for bruch and it was great. Prompt friendly service, lots of choice and really good food. Not cheap (not outrageous though) but would recommend if you want good food in a good environment
4
I've been enjoying the food, ambiance and experience for a number of years. The quality has been consistently very good Brunch, Lunch, Dinner...all nice and not too over thought
5
Abit pricy but apart from that awesome!!! Love the food and ambience! Great place to chill with friends and loved ones
5
Tried: Parma Ham Caesar Salad, Chicken Avocado Burrito, Seafood Laksa Linguine, Grilled Prawn Aglio Olio, Brownie w Ice CreamFood, service and setting were all awesome. Made my reservation via chope a day before for early mothers' day lunch on 10 May 2014. Skyve had little surprises for the mothers, complimentary wine and macarons, which was a really sweet gesture! Keep it up
4
Food was great, excellent service. All in a night we enjoyed thoroughly.Hats off to the service crew for putting up with our boisterousness and also for contributing to a great birthday celebration!The food was good: we ordered oysters Kpatrick/an naturel.Beef tartare and the foiegrasMains of beef Rossini, sous vide poulet and pork, duck confit as well as the kalbiSides of Hendricks gin & tonic
4
Hidden close by to Newton Food Centre, the restaurant is a pleasant find. A small menu but sufficient variety to suit most people, I found the food was good, however for a wine bistro I was disappointed in the Merlot and Malbec. I did find for two it was pricey for what we had. I doubt I'll go back, simply because of the choice that exists in Singapore
5
Dear Everyone at Skyve,Thank you for making our wedding such a memorable one. Right up till today, we are still hearing from our guests that they loved the food and beautiful ambience at Skyve. It was a whole new experience for them.When we first thought of visiting Skyve to check it out for our wedding, we were extremely pleased with the food we tried and also the wonderful service and information Maggie provided us since day one.We fell in love with the food and the place and how they seemed to emphasised on the food and promoting their restaurant rather than forcing packages down our throat like what many other restaurants and hotels do.Maggie and her team were extremely efficient with handling all the details leading up to the wedding and also accommodating our every request.The event went so smoothly and the service staff were excellent paying attention to every single one of our guests.Thank you again Maggie and your team for this wonderful experience.It will be something we will keep in our hearts forever.Love,Wei Meng and Joycley
5
It's my second time to Skyve, I'm really happy with their service. A special request made and it was fulfilled as to what I had hoped to be. Food was delicious just that the onion jus was a tad too salty other than that everything was perfect. Thank you
5
Great food in an off the track central location. Don't miss the ricotta pancakes ( they sell out fast!) and the French toast.
1
First impression was good for this cozy little place tucked away in quiet place. We saw a lot of good reviews and decided to try it out. Several items on the menu were not available. So we eventually ordered dishes we were not too fond of including the beef tartare. To our (bad) surprise, the crackers served with the beef tartare housed a couple of insects. One crawled out and made its way towards my girlfriend. The other was dead and lying between the crackers. Staff were very kind and understanding. They helped us to book a cab to leave to another restaurant
5
It was a great explore of new taste as well as cozy restaurant to be in. I felt so relax being in the restaurant; warm lighting and soothing music made it even more wonderful. Of course, not forgetting the food! I've order the Oysters (Super freesh!), truffle fries (crispy and yet not oily), Pork as my main course (soft, tender and juicy), Snickers bar as my desert (it's not the normal snickers bar we bought outside.....). I will definitely visit again! :)Note: The service is excellent! That's the most important to me when I visit any shops
5
What was meant to be a normal work day birthday lunch w colleagues turned out to be something quite nice and special for the bday gal.To be honest I was expecting a basic bday cake but the service was just excellent. Thanks CK and staff! And the pork cheeks burger was as he had recommended excellent. Will definitely be back again..
4
We made a reservation for a big group and the place was well-prepared when we arrived. Food and wine is good. We had a good experience with the friendly staff
5
Celebrated birthday.I want to note some dishes.Certainly fresh oysters! Beef on an edge.Pizza, Desserts.Everything is simply excellent!Very attentive administrator and waiters, added drinks immediately, orders accepted very quickly.The fine couple of musicians sang amazing
3
The food is great..But service is very terrible..They are rigid. They only allow people sitting in the lounge to order lounge snacks but not for the dinning table to order lounge food. same vice versa..When trying to get the waitresses attention, you can try calling them very loud 3 times.. knowing very well they heard. BUt they just ignore you totally.The restaurant ambience was destroyed by a bunch of noisy birthday party people. Management have totally no control with them making soo much noise causing noise pollution to others. I could barely hear my friend talking who is just sitting beside me.Overall, food is good but im extremely dissapointed with the service
4
If you have to pick only one thing on the menu, you have to try the luncheon chips! Thinly sliced and fried to the perfect crisp, the chips are out of this world! The other food items were good too. My personal favorites would be the pulled pork burger, truffle and thyme fries, buffalo wings and the spaghettini. Ambience was great on a Sunday night when I visited. The service was also decent and the wait staff were helpful and efficient. Price was a little steep for the amount of food we ordered, but it was an overall satisfying meal
5
Great fusion menu that combines a la carte dinner with lounge finger good in a very elegant way. Great live musi
5
Was here with some long-time college friends. We ordered two set lunches and two mains to share. The food is great, quality at good prices. The duck confit and pork is super, would come back for these again..was pleasantly surprised by the tomato soup, not the usual kind! The place is quite aloof from the rest of the world, yet its just next to orchard/newton area. Perfect for a long lunch
5
I went there on both nights this week as I have vouchers that are due at the end of the month. Ordered the beef (I've forgotten the name) that cost around $40. but honestly, it was the best steak that I had ordered for awhile. It was juicy and the doneness that I've requested was just right, medium-rare! I'm very impressed with the mashed potato and asparagus as well. It is definitely one of the recommended dishes that you should try when you're there! I've ordered the chicken pizza as well, however, there was much more mushrooms as compared to chicken in there. And being a person who doesn't like mushroom that much, I wasn't too glad on this dish. Hahaha.The second night I went, I've ordered their truffle fries, chicken wings and beef burgers. The chicken tasted like ha chiong kai, which isn't that much of a complain because I like hck. :) the beef burgers were mini but so bite size and yummy which was good! But the truffle fries was a disappointment though, about 80% of the truffle fries didn't had any truffle flavoured in it. I felt like I was just eating normal fries. Definitely would not recommend this.Overall, I'm just very impressed with the beef steak which thus made me give this restaurant a rating of excellent! :
5
Excellent service coupled with great food and ambience (love the live band) made the experience unforgettable.
4
This was our first visit to Skyve. The service was very attentive and friendly.The election of both food and drinks is very good.My eggs Benedict were cooked to perfection with nice tomatoes, mushroom and bacon on the side. The rest of my family was also happy with their respective choices.The ambience is okay but nothing special, maybe there is a different vibe at night.This place is casual for brunch, hence ideal for families or get togethers with friends.Yes, we will be back
5
This was my second time at Skyve. First time it was awesome food and great service. Second time, it was also awesome food and great service! My husband and I just wanted a nice evening for date night, not for a special occasion, just a simple date. And this place was it. Impeccable food (cleaned our plates!!!), friendly and attentive staff. It's not overly posh or pretentious, just a great casual place for a night out. I can't say enough good things about Skyve, except that it's one of the few restaurants that we'll go again and again
5
Celebrated my birthday at Skyve.The buffet spread was very tasty and excellent.CK and Maggie provided exceptional service and were super on the ball.Had an amazing birthday celebration and everyone had a great time
4
Our organisation had a corporate function at Skyve and it was great. the service was prompt and smooth and the venue was also spacious enough for performance and games. The food was delicious too, esp the starters. There were mixed reviews for their cocktails but I enjoyed mine, which was called Detention Class. We had an awesome time and much credit goes to the service team and chef of Skyve
5
This is the second visit to Skyve, which is a gem of a bistro serving great food and excellent wines. Atmosphere is very relaxed and serviced very good. My wife ANC I will definately be back for another meal, or maybe next time we will try out the eggs Benedict for breakfast and a coffee. The restaurant is off the beaten track yet centrally located and within a short walk from Newton MRT station. Try it out you will not be disappointed. Andrew L
4
My friend and I chose this place for a small celebration dinner. Reservations was easy via their website. The restaurant had a relaxing ambience and the service was quite good. We started off with some beer (happy hour), truffle fries and squid rings. For entrées, we chose the cereal crusted cod and mushroom stack with polenta. The cod was done to perfection but the polenta was decidedly too heavy and oily. It's a god thing we left some room for desserts. Their creme brûlée and molten chocolate cake were simply divine, accompanied with good, strong Vittoria coffee. In all, we spent about S$70 per person
5
The one and only best Lychee Saketini Oysters! nice combination and it was refreshing. The oysters were fresh that makes it even more appealing and tasty!The main courses tastes delicious with nice culinary art to the presentation. Unfortunately, one can only have so much in a day...will definitely be back again to try other main dishes.Great job to the team for the great service
4
A friend and I spent a very pleasant few hours here eating, drinking, eating some more and chatting. When we left, we had no idea how late it was, which must be a testament to how relaxed we both felt. The location of Skyve is interesting, near Newton Circus, but not near any other restaurants. If you go, watch out for the sign with the Skyve name, otherwise you may miss it. I think the premises used to be a school, so there is a kind of industrial space vibe going on, which I liked, but if you are looking for romantic and intimate, this is not the place.There are some really good things about Skyve and the best thing is probably their flexibility. The menu is varied and includes lots of a la carte items as well as a well priced set lunch. We ended up going a la carte, but there were some tempting choices on the set lunch as well. We shared a Caesar salad with Parma ham then I chose the truffle pasta and my dining companion had the Kurobuta pork collar. Mine was delicious, although the sauce could have been more truffley, and my companion seemed very pleased with his choice. We had chosen to go BYO, although the restaurant has a good wine list, with lots of well-priced (for Singapore) bottles. CK, who was looking after us, did a great job with decanting and serving our wine, in fact he did a great job full stop. Although there was no cheese course offered on the lunch menu, he created one for us to share, with freshly made flat bread. We also shared a chocolate brownie with cherry compote for dessert. It was just delicious.Can't wait to go again
4
Our food was excellent, service great, and location really pleasant, but mains were quite pricey, and for example, a very small capuccino cost 6 SGD
4
a nice place to hang out with friends after work..good ambiance to be away from the city
food served were mostly good and a plus point; friendly staff!
4
it was a day after vday and it was our anniversary! the team at Skyve was exceptionally awesome, with the memo specially printed for us :) The food was gastronomic, especially the fresh juicy oysters!! Dinner was served promptly and the ambience was at its right setting!Great job to the team at Skyve, will definitely be back for more!!!P.S: i was hoping for a little more gift, such as a complimentary dessert, but nonetheless still the thoughts that count
4
Had a Saturday brunch. There was a good selection of food, the location was great and the service was quick. Overall a great experience.
5
Awesome place for a quiet lunch for two! The poulet rotisserie and duck confit was perfect and the service was excellent. Highly recommended to go
4
I was pleasantly surprised by the service even from the point of making reservations. CK is friendly and always willing to assist. I was there for brunch and had the Kurobuta pork cheek burger. Excellent service added on to good food and great ambience made the experience a pretty good one
5
Great food and atmosphere. 5 stars! 2 thumbs. The Cod and he Sou vide egg spaghettini are perfectly cooked. Service staffs are very friendly even the baby gave a hi five
5
We went there for lunch on my husbands birthday, we got a birthday note on the table that was reserved for us with all the staff individually signing the note, that was simply wonderful and so personalised. I thought it was just a wonderful idea. The service and the food was brilliant. Hands down the best service we have received in any restaurant in Singapore. We will surely be back again
4
Love the ambience, love the food, love the interior design!Worth every penny. Try and you'll definitely love it
5
Really enjoyed my experience! A must go! Cool seating and furnishings. Go visit and find out for yourself

I just done my Sunday Brunch at Skyve on 2nd Feb 2014 with a group of friends. Initially, my reservation was only for 4 pax. But more people wanted to join, I called once to expand our reservation to 6pax and again to 8pax. The host was very nice and was able to help us with it. So we got there on time ordered our food and drinks. I ordered mini beef burgers… I would think Carl’s Jr tasted better. And I had cider for drinks, which was served in a champagne glass stained with a pink lipstick mark. And i was not wearing any lipstick. When I asked for a fresh glass, the servers gladly replaced. However, half of my drink which was by the bottle was in the glass which was not automatically replace. We decided to ask for replacement of my cider, the server had to check with the management. When the fresh bottle was served, they actually took away the half bottle left as well. We are not cheapo, but we felt there was no service recovery to make us feel better of the situation. On top of that, the mini burgers were tasteless. I could have made better tasting burgers. I was expecting more from Skyve, as it was my 2nd time there and I was the one who recommended for my whole group of friends to go there after my fantastic 1st visit. And also, they had to ask us to leave due to a subsequent event which they would be hosting in the evening. It would be nice if they let us know earlier than to chase us away
4
Skyve is a cosy hideout away just mere minutes from the commercial hustle and bustle of what is downtown Orchard Road, The food is excellent and the service professional and friendly. Parking is convenient and you don't feel rushed to finish up beyond your own pace to enjoy the evening. Specialities include principally cuisine 'slow cooked' aka 'sous vide'. Couple of my favourite starters include the Spagettini and the Tuna Tartar. Oysters with champagne on Thursday are also a great idea. The place has a dining room indoors ( acoustics could be a tad 'brittle' in nature with the glass interiors) , a comfy drinks lounge section with LIVE unplugged performers twice a week, and an outdoor patio area too. At this time of the year when the weather is especially cool & breezy, dining/drinking outdoors can be a real treat
4
Had a cod fish and steak with a friend and both of us enjoyed it. Ambiance is perfect for friends or couples to hang out and chill after a day of work. Food was served in an acceptable time frame. Will definitely go back for more
4
Been here a few times....near town but not crowded. Interesting brunch & love the salads! Staff also accommodating, will whip up something not on the menu if they can do it!Parking is a breeze! No queues, waiting in lines.....
4
The first time we tried to go to Skyve for brunch, we failed to make a booking. When we got there, the place was not packed and we could see a few tables empty, so we were quite hopeful. Unfortunately, we were told that the tables were reserved. When probed further, we found out that the table was reserved for 10:30 am. We were perplexed because it was already 11 am at the time. We were turned away for people who were late, or worse, may be no-shows! At the time, I had decided not to go again.I found myself at a dilemma when I kept hearing friends rave about the food. The straw that broke the camel's back came with the deal that gave us a one-for-one on mains. Man, am I glad we decided to give it another chance!I had the sous vide eggs benedict, which came with muffin, sauted mushrooms and streaky bacon. I love how with the sous vide technique, you get perfectly cooked eggs. How many times have you gone to a brunch place and you order eggs benedict, and the egg yolk comes out solid? Not here, nosiree!My wife had the maple granola. Huge portion. I think she almost had a cramp in her jaw eating all that fibre.Even though we only had brunch, we could tell that there was quite a bit of effort going into the food. If this is their standard, I will definitely be back very soon to try their regular menu. Just make sure you book your table
4
Love coming here!!! Easy, casual place for weekend brunch or drinks and small bites.... Been here several times and the quality of food has always been consistently good. Service staff also very well-polished and professional :-
4
It was a really great experience visiting this restaurant with a group of friends who has so much to catch up on. The food that was recommended by the staff was fantastic and I really like my main course which is the pork. the mini pork cheeks burger we ordered for starters was juicy and tender as well. In short, it is very highly recommended if you are just looking for a good place to chill with very good food and a great ambience. and there is 1 for 1 happy hour on house wines in the evening as well! one drawback perhaps was that the staff were not really topping up the ice water that was served in a really small cup.. but that is just very minor as the good food and ambience more than makes up for it
5
Excellent ambiance and it wasn't crowded for Xmas dinner. They were pet-friendly too which was much appreciated. Staff were warm and friendly and were very efficient.A very memorable experience for my group of friends, so thank you for that. i would highly recommend anyone to Skyve be it for a romantic date, a family dinner or a place to bring your furry friends along for dinner. one area of improvement was that a better singer/entertainer would have been preferred or even the music which was playin prior to the performance
4
The burger tt I oredered was really unusual. The meat is tender and fries are generously sizzled with truffle oil
5
Had Christmas morning brunch with a group of friends and it was great! The atmosphere was perfect for the bunch of us who pretty much were looking for a place to chill and rest our minds for awhile before heading back to work on Boxing Day. The food was good. All 4 of us had some variation of eggs and they tasted great. I would recommend Skyve to anyone who's looking for a nice place to relax and enjoy a good meal, especially with friends
5
Great simple and cozy ambience. Helpful staff who played along to make the surprise a success!!Luncheon chips were amazing. Never knew you could do that. Truffle fries were very good too. The mentayaki oysters were a surprise. For someone who doesn't eat oysters, these were incredibly tasting. 4-course set menu:1) Manhattan chowder was just nice. Consistency and taste were perfect. Not too overpowering.2) Sous Vide & spaghettini - good carb starter. Was it pesto? Amount just enough to still enjoy the mains3) Beef tenderloin - although no one check what doneness preference, I thought it was done (medium) incredibly well. Preserving the juiciness of the meat.3) Cereal cut Cod (was the other option on mains) was a very interesting fusion of cereal-style cooking which enhances the sweetness of the cod. 4) chocolate brownie was rich and "chocolaty", not dry as some places make them.All these washed down with red wine, proseca and sangria!! Will definitely return soon to explore your ala-carte menu!! It was a great memorable evening!
4
4 of us had brunch here on a Saturday and we love every dishes we had- skyving's breakfast, eggs ben, hotcakes and banana nut french toast! Service was great too!
5
My favorites are the duck confit and the Bloody Mary oyster shooters.
For brunch, I would recommend their ala carte buffet brunch/breakfast.

Thanks so much for a wonderful experience! It was quick and very tasty all around. I cannot wait to return. If there was only one complaint I had to make the Lobster Bisque was a bit salty... But other than that it really was a great experience

Decided to pick this place for our New Year and my daughter's birthday lunch. Certainly no regrets because we all enjoyed the food. We ordered the cioppino to share followed by seafood linguine for my daughter, prawn aglio olio for hub and their brown & orange sauce pork collar. In minutes, we finished every single food on our plates. Service staff was great. We asked for a complimentary cake for my daughter's birthday, though thought they would have sang her a bday song. I would definitely recommend my friends here

Location tucked away at the outskirts of town making it a nice place to chill out.The oysters and the snack menu are a great way to start the evening. Despite the small selection, the main courses are well prepared. The beef, duck confit, lobster Spaghettini (not always available) and cod fish are all excellent and flavorful. We especially like to go to Skyve on the days with live music. We were there to celebrate my parents wedding anniversary and my sons joined the live band to sing along for the special occasion

This is a nice place for a drink and some food either as a couple or with friends. It's not too busy as it's away from the centre of town although it's clear that people like it enough to make the effort to come. So far I've only had drinks and bar snacks - pizza slab and truffle fries - but they were all to a good standard. The service is good and the prices are what you expect from a quality bar in Singapore

Spent once a week at skyve every week for the month of December and its fantastic chillax time! Always look forward to heading there and left with a smile after the yummylicious food! Thanks chun kiat for recommending the luncheon chips.. Now we know.. Spam really sells! We also love the crackling sous vide pork (hope I get the dish name right) and pesto chicken pizza almost become our regular dish! Enjoy the live bands very much, especially tt Wednesday with the little boy performing his spontaneous act with the live band.. Lovely crowd and atmosphere! I definitely will head there as frequent as I can.. Maybe for brunch.. Or juz to play with tt golden retriever who is a regular there too.. Haha! Happy 2014 in advance to chun kiat and team.. Thx for ya wonderful services!!

Try the oysters, they are really beautifully prepared and presented. The sous vide dishes, duck confit, pork, lamb, beef were all tender, flavorful and beautifully presented. I went with 4 friends, we all ordered different dishes and then shared. I highly recommend you do this to enhance your experience. I loved the menus and the Skyve theme. The service was great. Dessert was very good too

My husband and I have been ardent fans of the chef who helped set up and run Skyve before this. Although he has moved on, it's great that the kitchen has kept up with the high standards of food and continue to use the sous vide method. Their food is really tasty and portioned well- only wished that they had a rotation menu so that there are more choices to try!I would give them full points, if not for the noise level. I agree with othe reviewers- sometimes the jazz music and the level of noise in the dining area just makes it impossible to have a dinner conversation. This becomes even worse when there are big groups trying to overcome the noise, haha

We had 64 deg Sous Vide Egg & Spaghettini, Cereal Crusted Cod, Sous Vide Pork and Squid Ink Pasta for our mains - all of which were very well executed. The cod went very well with the cereal which gave a nice crisp to the dish. Spaghettini had a strong truffle smell and though creamy, was not too jialat. Pork was so tender and loved the crackling skin that came along with it. Squid Ink was just right, and balanced the meal with its more neutral taste.Mains were definitely the highlights of the meal. Point to note was that sangria came at a very reasonable price though. Bill came up to be around 312 for 4 of us. Among us we shared, 2 appetizers (Cheese Platter, Mushroom Soup), 4 mains, 2 desserts, sangria and 2 ciders.Would definitely return again. :

The food and the service was just outstanding. And to very reasonable price. Tvist must be one of Singapore's hidden treasures. Highly recommended
5
Definitely one of the place you must visit. Brunch is great, dinner is awesome as well. Location tucked away at the outskirts of town cuts down the hustle and bustle making it a great restaurant to chill out

This is a nice place for a good coffee or a nice lunch. Good atmosphere and quality of food. I like the jazz music in the background although sometimes too loud.Also a good place for having a discussion over a coffee with a business partner

Was there with 2 other friends who brought me there to celebrate my birthday. while showing us to the seats which we can get to choose as there are more than one table available, My friends just commented to each other that they will leave it to the bday gal to decide. Happily we enjoyed the meal and towards the later part when our dessert orders arrived, a small cake came together as well with the note of happy bday on the plate. We were all pleasantly surprised as well as puzzled as my friends keep reiterating that they never pre-order nor did they tell the server. Moreover the cake was immediately placed in front of me.As we all really could not figure out, we had to ask them when we paid. Obviously this last server does not know and when we requested him to check our, we were pleasantly surprised that it was in fact the very first server who brought us to our seats. She has apparently taken note of my friends comments on letting the birthday gal decide that she concluded that I was the one who is here to celebrate. I must add that we are all very impressed with the sensitive touch that is so essential to a good delivery of great customer service :-)Following this incident I had been sharing the great service. Go try it and hope that you all get excellent service too! Was told by others that the brunch was good and I tell myself to go back for that :-)

Egg benedict is the best I had.. Tuna sandwich is also very good. Tasty n value for $.Nice quite, cosy ambience

The oysters are so FRESH and tasty!! My friends and I enjoyed the food, ambience, music and most importantly the service! Keep it up crews of Skyve! Well done! This is a restaurant not to be missed!

A lovely place to hangout, quietly seated near newton circus. Great for events and weddings. Live music on weds a plus! Food, wine and service top notch
5
Enjoyed the live band, followed the band from red dot to skyve and found out skyve was very atmospheric. love the atmosphere and the food was very unique. The one-for-one special perk my night up and to add warmest service i ever seen in these recent two years in singapore

Decided to try this restaurant after reading many reviews. Place was quite empty when we were there for breakfast. Service was great, nice ambience , food was not too bad. Remember to ask for the $6 nett breakfast set menu ( without drinks) . Servers did not show the menu until we ask for it

very charming, unassuming place close to a school, so you almost mistake it for being part of it. Relaxed place with good drinks and food, nice alternative if you are done eating at Newton Circus hawker centre.

Was an invited guest at a Wedding Anniversary that booked the whole restaurant. The menu was fixed. The outstanding dishes were the oysters and the main dish of Spicy Kalbi Beef Short Ribs. They prepare their fresh oysters in a variety of ways in the a la carte menu and we got to taste three varieties - au naturel, lychee saketini gratina and another with a cucumber topping. The oysters were plump and creamy and the lychee one was the best - there was a tiny lychee/sake sorbet on top of the oyster and it complemented the oyster well. Almost like a shooter but these oysters were served on the shell. And the oysters had already been detached from the shell - so no struggling was required!The Spicy Short Ribs were cooked sous vide style and the meat while tender, still retained the bite expected from this type of cut. There were also chewy, yummy "tendon" pieces and the slightly spicy glaze made this dish stand out. A nice touch was the accompanying crispy sweet potato/yam "ribbons" that I polished off in a jiffy.The restaurant's location is a plus point. It is located "behind" the Newton Hawker Centre and has ample parking out front. It looks like an ideal place to entertain, or to have a lazy Sunday brunch, without the hassle of fighting with the crowd. I will be back as I am eyeing the sous vide egg and spaghettini (which was the alternative appetiser to the oysters) and the duck confit

It was the morning after a party and we were in need of something to soak up the excesses of the previous night. Skyve hit the spot perfectly, truffled scrambled eggs with baby asparagus and portobello mushrooms with sourdough toast was really excellent, as was the prawn linguine alio olio with chilli, not to mention sinfully creamy French toast with berries and maple syrup. We sat outside which was very pleasant, although it was pretty crowded with just one poor waitress struggling to serve all of us. Will be back soon

This restaurant specialised on French sous Vide cooking. Lamb shank and Duck confit are must have. So are the beef dishes. For starters the fois gras is out of this world. the oysters comes in 5 different styles you can order half dozen in all different flavour but please call beforehand as they don't keep much stock to keep fresh.

For reviews and more, visit blog at ms-skinnyfatSous vide is the focus at Skyve Wine Bistro, as it was at Table 66. With the larger kitchen, Chef Vincent has taken the sous vide technique to a higher level and practically every item was done this way for their updated menu. If i were to give a description of the 64 deg Sous Vide Egg & Spaghettini ($18) on the menu, it would be 'The starter that you will NEVER wanna share". I'm just a little disappointed that they only serve this for dinner! Soft poached egg, spaghettini in truffle salsa, iberico ham, truffle hollandaise.. this is perfect breakfast food hello! The truffle taste was pretty strong on aroma but the taste was bland. However, if you mix the whole lot together, the saltiness of the Iberico ham will help to overcome that. Still.. this is my favorite dish.When i first heard that we were gonna do a tempura of beef tongue, i was puzzled. Like seriously? Beef tongue? With all its chewiness? But that's the great thing about sous vide and its ability to break down all that sinew and proteins and that's how the beef tongue became.. Tofu. The other half of Tongue in Cheeks ($36) is a 6 hours sous vide wagyu beef cheeks that is soooo well done (not in the overcooked sense) it melts. Lovely lovely dish.Now what i like better than the beef and fish was the Lamb Rack ($40), a lovely grilled marinated lamb rack served with a light curry spiced roasted pumpkin (da luuurve). The sauce is a little sweet and sour a la Korean style when eaten on its own. However, when accompanied with the mango and mint chutney, the dish took on a Mediterranean taste. Surprise surprise.Desserts were pretty stellar. The Mango & Cheese Semifreddo ($12) wasn't the least heavy/gelat because of the frozen lime foam that tasted like a zingy yogurt. I'm glad that Chef Vincent shares my love for buttery and crumbly pastries because the sablee cookies that he insists on making himself were fabulous.Inspired By Reds ($12) is an intense strawberry parfait served with sous vide strawberry in balsamic vinegar (werrrt), raspberry sorbet, flower tuile, dehydrated raspberry. I can go on eating dehydrated raspberries because the flavor was much more powerful than the fresh ones.Skyve gave the typical Tiramisu ($12) a twist with this open presentation. The ladyfingers were soaked in STRONG coffee liqueur, piled with whipped and light mascarpone cream and icy kahlua granita. More crunchy cookie bits to give it more texture. So yea.. Skyve is definitely my chill out place from now. It's great for a lazy brunch (which i will post up on the blog soon), a fun dinner with the girls or even for drinks with the pals. I do love the alfresco area on a breezy night. Live music also available every Wed and Friday. Now let's go skyving. ;

This is a lively bar & restaurant. Hip & trendy. The food was excellent and service very attentative. It's quite pricey and watch out for the 'busy rooting' service charge, which they added on top of GST & service charge. New to us!!

Comparing it to other places in SGP our group found it ok in terms of price, unlike the other reviewer. Food and drinks were a good mix In terms of price and offer. Friends and I went for the communal Sunday lunch and we found it good value with the drinks and the amount of time we spent there

Went for dinner based on a friend's recommendation. Located a short walk from Newton MRT, it's close to Orchard Road, yet far from the crowds. Tables were available without reservation as the operating hours are 10am to late.The atmosphere throughout our meal was peaceful and welcoming.There wasnt the rushed feeling that staff wanted you to eat quickly and leave so they could pack up and go home. Staff were attentive but not intrusive. Tables were cleared on tmely basis.The bar area is partitioned off from the main dining area. With big oversized chairs, subdued lighting and background music,it was a great cozy nook to unwind, relax and catch up with friends.What we tried:Oysters - Au Natural, nice and freshOysters - Japanese Style, fresh with a nice blend of flavoursOysters - Skyvefella, cooked - oysters lost in the sauceEgg Benedict - Nice blend of flavours and texturesOcean Trout - Enjoyed the potato pave and herb fondue. Trout has crispy skin but was a tad dry on insideDuck Leg Confit - Nice crisp duck legs. Again a tad try on the insideHomemade ice cream - Served between 2 wafer slices with toppings of strawberry, caramelized apple and mini marshmellows. Yummy.Ivory dome - Fantastic blend of flavours within the dome. Delicious.Their desserts and appetizers better than their mains

I agree with the previous reviewer that the chef is good. The food is imaginative and nicely done. Both my starter and fish main course were done extremely well. Wine cellar is also nicely curated; impressive selection of Bordeaux and some decent Italians, as well. My biggest gripe is the service. My server was quite friendly, but extremely erratic and knew very little about the food or the limited menu. Really detracted from a restaurant that is aimed at providing a memorable culinary experience

Someone wrote a good review on this place having good brunch. Having had brunch at numerous places in Singapore and around the world.This has to be the worst. I do not expect anyone to charge >$20 for a main, and >$6 for coffee, if you can't do any better than I normally do at home. In terms of value for money, PS Cafe, Prive, Epicurious and many other local faves beat them hands down, and for that same price range. I definitely would not be coming back to this place again. What doesn't go well with a customer is poor quality food, even the presentation is sloppy, and a price that totally doesn't warrant that. They are in a nice location, so it is a shame that their food did not keep up with the place. District 10 which was previously in this same location was more deserving of this locale
