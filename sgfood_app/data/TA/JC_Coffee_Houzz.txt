Tucked away along Joo Chiat Road, a self contained neighbourhood with one of the largest holding of those colourful conservation of pre-war shop houses. Once inside, We were warmly welcomed by their GM Diane Yong. Her articulate & charismatic promotion on JC's Houz Specialmade us all d r o o o l...We polished up all our finger licking JC' Houzz Special including the Molten Lava Cakes & ice Cream WaffleFood aside, the Cosy Ambience and the Contemporary Decor complimented with its Oldies but Goodies selection of music brought me back to the Good Old Days, reminiscing those Nostalgic memory of then The Magnolia Snack Bar & Skillet Coffee HouseWithout being prejudice or bias, this review was written after my 3rd visit and having savoured most of their food on JC's Menu and summary of feedbacks from my family and friends Rating: ☆☆☆☆☆ Price: $$ Very Affordable Ambience & Service: ☆☆☆
