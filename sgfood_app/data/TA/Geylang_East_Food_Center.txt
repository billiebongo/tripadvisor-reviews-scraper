There's a stall facing the road selling Lor Mee, I've been there since young and I don't find better Lor Mee than this very often. Most other food choices are also very affordable. Visitors to this area should stop here for your lunch. :)

Nice place to try cheap and quick street food. Dont miss the pork fried rice, beef stew and noodle soup. Serves beer and other drinks

Having lunch here quite often since my office relocated nearby. Plenty of stalls with lots of variety. This is definitely one of the best food centers I have been to in Singapore.

I am not a fan of the area as I had problems around my hotel, but go here and one gets very good food at half the price of downtown.

This food centre is renovated and upgraded not too long ago, with a few stalls changing hands. A few stalls I'd recommend would be the duck porridge, fried prawn mee, pig organ soup, braised pig organ with kway, jiming zichar stall and the wanton mee stall

Roti Prata at Geylang East is, in our opinion, the best in Singapore. Operated by 3 young Indians, the store offers a selection of different Pratas. We had 10 Roti Prata Kosong (that means without eggs), 2 Roti Prata Egg (means mixed with one egg), 1 egg and cheese Prata and 1 martabak with mutton.Price is reasonable! We did not have enough capacity to try Nasi Briyani (yellow rice with curry chicken and pickles) but we saw our neighbors eating. Looks great and a reason to come back for more...Simply lovely and delicious! Yummy ..

Lucy's Penng Delights at Blk 117 Aljunied Ave 2 #01-05 has to be the best and most authentic Penang guotiao and laksa in the whole of Singapore! Fresh ingredients, bouncy and large prawns and the best thing is the dish is not oily at all! Also tries their laksa which was delicious too. Great neighbourhood atmosphere, residents lazing and chilling with their coffees. A must visit when you are in the area
