Really good cookies with ice cream. The matcha cookies was the bomb. Thought I would be sick of it in a few bites but the cookies really wasn't overly sweet.

We took the staff's advice and opted for a double scoop. The ice cream was good and the experience overall was very pleasant. There is free wi-fi available as well. We plan to return to try the ice cream lava cookies.

We were recently in Singapore and this spot was recommended by friends of our son. The four of us shared two creations. You pick out which cookie or cake type dessert you want and which ice cream to go with it. We had the lava cake with chocolate ice cream and a cookie dessert with some kind of berry ice cream. I wasn't sure if I would like it because I don't really like chocolate ice cream and a number of the other flavors weren't ones of my choosing but everything tasted delicious. You place your order and sit down because the person then goes and makes it so it comes out warm. When we were there it was a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't that busy. It's a small place so it might get busy sometime. It's a little different from just getting a dish or cone of ice cream. It was definitely worth a visit

Went to this place on seeing a friend putting a post on facebook. Really lovely small,quaint place, but looked after with love.. Loved there flavoured ice creams in the lava cookie especially the passion fruit. The lava cookies and ice cream is suffice and really enjoyed it. My wife adored there whiskey christmas lava cookie special, to die for, a definite winner. The service of the staff there was good, friendly, fast and efficient. The combination of the ice cream and the dark chocolate is a winner. Will definitely be going back with friends and famil

A very instagramable product. Staff would actually bring the cookie on the hot pan and ice-cream in a scoop separately and ask before slapping the ice-cream onto the cookie and making the molten filling ooze out. Personally, I find the taste changer is more of the ice-cream than the molten content. Place holds less than 20 pax, hence better to go on a weekday than weekend. They have online offer occasionally, hence a value for money if one manages to grab the deal

Most important first: the lava cookie with ice cream was so delicious!! Amazing taste and presentation, we were blown away. On top of this the woman serving us was so nice to let me taste the different ice cream flavours. The place is very fresh, but does not have a lot of seating. Would really reccomend!!

A great place for dessert after a good meal. Very friendly and dynamic staff. They serve different flavors of cookie set. The combination is really good with hot cookie as base and delicious scoop of ice cream on top.

We were impressed with the cookie which went well with the ice cream melting on it...i loved the lychee sorbet and salted caramel.. best of all the service was excellent!
5
Very delicious ice cream. They let me try a few different flavours to choose one that I liked the best. Very busy, no free tables so I had to take away.

Uniquely blend of fresh baked cookie/brownie paired with your favourite craft ice-cream. Very refreshing and surprisingly, not too sweet. Perfect dessert for the young & old!

A nice place to spend your lazy afternoon, for a sweet tooth like me , the ice cream is just "WOW" !!!

Definitely a place that i will suggest for gathering with friends or family. The lava cookies is so unforgettable and when it comes together in my mouth, the lava taste explode in my mouth and the ice cream flavour come after that.üëçüèªüëçüèª

A 15 mins walk from Mustafra Centre at Seragoon Road or take a train to Lavender Mrt Stati and have a short 10 mins walk towards Jalan Besar Stadium, you will find this cosy cafe where they make awesome and delicious home make cookies, brownies and even ice cream. A franchise from Bangkok Thailand, they have receive great reviews by food bloggers alike. Constantly changing their ice cream flavours is one of their plus points as well and you get to try it. Some desert cafes do not let you try their ice cream (sadly its true). If you have any doubts on what ice cream goes well with the brownie or cookie, feel free to ask their friendly staff for advice for preferred pairing. So if you are in the vicinity and want to satisfy or desert craving, head on down to Creamery Boutique Ice Creams and enjoy some yummy and delicious desert
