Good durian and kaya swiss roll cakes. Make a call first before going to check if store is open or if they have ran out of any cakes. Go there and just say your order to avoid any unhappiness with the rude owner.

Got some kaya and strawberry swissrolls. Kaya was nice. Strawberry was a little sweet. Worth a try but will only buy if I am in the area.

Usually there is a long queue at this shop, for a good reason: the cakes are excellent! Not too sweet, light...(If you are not dogmatic), best are the durian rolls, then the kaya...

We ordered 3 flavours, kaya was especially nice! I like strawberry because the fruit can be found between the cake, not just the cream.

Highly sought after by a niche local followers. Durian rolls were wonderful and creamy too. Irresistible desserts

Having heard this name for a long time, finally the hub drove me here to "sample" it. We bought their signature Kaya Swiss roll ($8), and the chocolate one ($7). Well I would recommend the Kaya flavor. To me, it's very authentic and nice. If you are walking around the Arab Street area, take a swing around into Kandahar Street. It is directly opposite the big yellow house ( Gedung Kuning).Many other flavours awaiting for youu

We bought one durian and one green tea red bean swiss rolls this morning. After making the payment, we decided to walk around Arab Street for a while and the swiss rolls might not be fresh if we carried it under the hot sun, so I went back to the cake shop to ask whether I could put the swiss rolls into their fridge for 2 hours. But the middle age lady who has attended us just now just said" NO, we have no space to keep your cakes!'This kind of after sale service is absolutely rude

After a very long time, my colleagues did a mass order to R&G Cake Shop. As usual, they did not disappoint.The Almond Cookies came in a reusable container (like Lock & Lock type). Tasty (the cookies, not the container). The swiss rolls were yummy too. Must try the Durian roll (not in the office or else memo will come out) and kaya.We had to do a second mass order shortly after the first as people wanted more.I wanted to go into the shop last month as I had a family dinner to attend nearby. Didn't go in as it looked like the doorway looked a bit narrow and was blocked by some furniture. We always had our orders delivered and most of us had never been to the actual bakery.Do try it. At least you can say that you actually did try the goodies even if you eventually don't like them

Decided to try their Swiss Roll after reading the reviews and heard from so many people. So we bought a chocolate and a green tea roll from them. However, the moment we step in, the auntie shouted "wait" without asking what we want. After choosing the rolls, she just place them in a plastic bag roughly and handed them is unwillingly. Well, we thought perhaps the rolls are really yummy so we simply dismissed her rudeness. Upon trying the first bite of the roll, we thought this is really over rated! It is not nice at all. Yes, it is moist but it is definitely not the best in Singapore and the taste of the chocolate and green tea are too artificial. We wonder how much food colouring and food essence they used. Verdict: We will never buy again and in fact we discard the remaining rolls. Polar has better cakes than them and is so much more accessible.
