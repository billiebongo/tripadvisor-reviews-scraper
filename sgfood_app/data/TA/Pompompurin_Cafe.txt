Nice setting. It is more of an experiential ride. Kids love it! Photo taking with different Pompompurin settings plus the cute food decorations!

I just wanna said little bit disappointed about the taste of food, little bit pricey but the taste is bad!
For pompompurin lover maybe u will like the theme

This place is a one time experience. The food is average and once you have been here the novelty wears off and there is no compelling reason to come back as the food is not very good.

we all had different dishes and all were made in the pompompurin style. we liked especially the pancakes

Usually it is rather expensive for most of these themed restaurant and it applies to here as well, just not THAT expensive. It is the price of typical western food plus a little bit more. Well, you get all the food themed with the cute Sanrio character Pom Pom Purin! And at least I would give them the credit of making the nice rice dumpling into the shape of the cute character if not anything else!The food is actually pretty decent and in fact good as compare to even some "typical" western food chains. You basically come here for the environment and atmosphere more than anything else. Feel free to take photos of the food, the seat, the eateries and everything else. They are all selected with the theme with good considerations.I would also urge anyone who wish to go do so fast, The restaurant is closing on Aug 20 2017, so unless you plan to visit it in another country (Taiwan's has also closed. FYI)

Came here for lunch on a quiet weekday afternoon - seats were aplenty.Ordered 2 lunch sets for myself and my spouse:- Butter and Shoyu Pasta (Spaghetti) ($13.99)- Hamburg(er) Rice ($16.99)- Matcha Latte ($9.99)- Iced Peach Tea ($6.99)The food was so-so, and the only thing I could recall was:- The hamburg rice was so sticky it was like eating glutinous rice. Not what I expected.Nothing else stuck in my mind as the food was really of an ordinary quality.This themed-cafe is good for kids though, but it saddens me to say that the food will probably not amaze even the kids once they've had a taste of it

Went with my kid and hubby and ordered pancakes and cheese tart. There wasn't much people but the servers were not attentive enough. The cheese tart tasted sourish and we asked to have it changed but they said it was the lemon used but still they were nice to change it. Pancakes were acceptable. Merchandise were not too expensive and they give free glass mugs to you when u order the mains. Good for a one time experience

I don't get these "theme" restaurants which basically serves food and drinks dressed in the character of the theme.This cafe is located in orchard central next to 313 orchard mall. It's not new and thus has sustained the initial early novelty interests ..We ordered their pancakes and some ice tea. Honestly.....i have had better and at cheaper prices...

The food is nice but really rave-worthy -- somewhere between the quality of Hello Kitty Cafe Orchid Garden Changi Airport and Pokemon Cafe Bugis. The afternoon tea set is well worth the $40 price tag, since it's serves two and come with premiums you can take home. Overwall, a fun way to spend the afternoon for Sanrio and Pompompurin fans

The cafe had a nice ambience. However the food was average. The fruit tea we ordered was lovely. It wasnt very crowded. The cafe was nicely decorated. Hope the quality of the food improves soon!

I'm lucky enough that I don't have to face the problem of crowd to line up for seat. The environment is nice and peace. While the foods are delicious, and the workers are very friendly.

Very nice and cute and detailed pompompurin decor and there is a plush toy at each table. Food looks awesome cute and just like pompom. However taste wise is quite lacking.

The Cafe is extremely adorable as everything in their cafe is about Pompompurin. On the tables, there are very cute Pompompurin stuff toys. I like how there is a gate instead of a door placed at the entrance so it feels like you are entering Pompompurin land. We ordered a lunch set, you can choose any main course and any drink and you can get $3 off your bill. I ordered the Autumn Special dish which was a rice dish with omelette and mushroom sauce. My drink was the cookie and cream caramel latte. My dish was average and the drink just tasted like milk. However I was especially impressed with the presentation of the food and drink(refer to photos). My mother ordered the spicy pasta with a fruit tea and she really enjoyed it. The fruit tea was very fragrant and the spicy pasta was super delicious(especially the bacon!!) I feel that the cafe is definitely worth going but a little bit pricey. The menu is also very kiddish and it seems to be more of a kids menu. However, the cafe and presentation of the food is extremely adorable and very unique!

I admit, I enjoy cute things, and seeing the cute decor and style of this cafe simply excited me. Sure, the prices are expensive, but I expected that due to the nature of themed cafes. The food was aesthetically pleasant, with the cafe's mascot being ever-present in all the dishes. However, it was rather disappointing. I had the beef curry rice (can't recall the name) and the beef was like, tiny. Totally not filling for a 18 dollar dish

We took our 5yo here whilst her older sisters were out with friends. She loved the cuteness of the character and sitting with a big stuffed toy and eating in a cute booth and the take home mug included in the meal.We were unimpressed with the menu offering. Feeling too awkward to walk out and not wanting to disappoint our daughter, we ordered a "royal pancake stack", a pot of tea and an iced caramel latte to share. It was less than memorable and set us back 52SGD

I love pompompurin that's the reason why I decided to visit the cafe. Indeed the cafe is nicely decorated; food are well presented but is slightly overpriced. The portion can't keep you full at all. Average meal is $35 with beverage.A place you will only visit once for experience and photo taking :

Went Pompompurin Cafe last month (8 August) no queue, so we went in the cafe. Ordered the mango pudding, Kaya and butter pancake and the summer jelly. They are too cute. A place to take pictures, eat with the cute pompompurins. A mango pudding for $19.99. Think that do not worth it. After you eat finish the pudding, it's filled with cream... Below is a sponge cake. This should be cost only about $8-10  The summer jelly is okay, but the Kaya and butter pancake... Somehow is only Kaya.. Butter is about 1/4 of the pancake or even less..... Total cost $71 for these. But the good thing is that you could take kawali pictures of pompompurin and eat with the pompompurin beside you. ( A plush toy) Maybe I will go back again sometime.. But only for the experience

I was thr on a weekday afternoon 3.30 pm till bout 5 pm. The cafe was very quiet and only bout 4 tables occupied including mine. No queue at all. Service staffs were very friendly and my orders took less than 5 min to be served. Excellent cafe in Singapore ! However, DO NOT visit the cafe from 6.30pm onwards as the waitin time in e q is expected to be 15 min n above. I love the interior design n furniture of this cafe. Do not worry about dining alone as pompompurin soft toy will be thr to keep u accompanied thruout ur meal time! You can even hug it all time

If you are a fan of Pompompurin, I’m sure you will love this café, thought personally I think the dessert was okay and definitely not for those looking for a wallet-friendly café to visit.We ordered the Bagel’s Special Pancake Tower ($21.90) which comes with a Pompompurin mug where you can bring back home as a souvenir. Layers of pancakes are stacked together, filled with caramel, chocolate and custard, accompanied with chopped fruits. We felt that the pancake was alright and I guess the main reason for people ordering thing is for the bring-home mug.Read more about our dining experience at darrenbloggie.co

Overload of Kawaii goodness. If you have kids they will love it. Or if you have a wife or girlfriend you will score some points. Wasn't dissappointed we went. A nice peaceful spot away from the action.

The restaurant has very good decoration and definitely good place to take photos. However, the food we ordered were all disappointed! Not worth another visit.

Like most cartoon themed cafe out there, it surely have a good decor on its interiors and food.. unfortunately the food also tasted like most of those cartoon themed cafe out there, bland and satisfying only to children I guess.. well its a pity that I can, at least, make a pasta taste better than what they made.. and the worst thing is the price was quite expensive considering the taste!! at least the give you a mug to go home with lo

Was kind of excited to check this place up, the queue was long in June. Reach there at 10am, and get to be seated around 12.30pm. There is only 3 waitress serving outside, obviously is short of man power. The environment are filled with cuteness, the food and drinks was just average. Nothing much to comments about. Price is not cheap either. The menu is the same regardless of which day (morning, lunch, dinner) you going

My gal friend and I had decided to visit the cafe for an impromptu lunch. Luckily we had reached early, otherwise we would be queuing for a while. The aesthetics was really cute with the characters and it was very instagrammable. Even the food decoration was good. However I can't say much about the menu. The drinks were too sweet. The pancakes were as hard as cookies. Even the services were lagging as the crew seem to be mentally absent. Unfortunately we will not be returning to the cafe in future.

Came here because Purin was my favourite cartoon character during my childhood days and my kids love it. Food was on the pricey side and it looked nicer than it tasted.Overall, it is a place for new experience and for people who love to take photos of their pretty food

Went here around 4 pm and the line wasn't too long. Got in after only 10 minute wait. As one can imagine, the concept is the main drive to visit. The menu is quite small and there is no vegetarian option in the main dishes. They try to create the pompompurin face on every dish which is really nice. We ordered banana pancakes and Napolitana pasta, which came with the free cute cup. Service was not bad at all and fairly quick. One thing we were told is that we couldn't move seats even after other customers left. Not sure what the reason is behind this policy. Overall, worth visiting once but expensive to visit regularly.

Chose to go here for Hi Tea with friends. Really cute cafe to look at. Food wise - menu is limited. I seriously thought there will be finger food but no. The food is pretty expensive even though they r cute to look at. The Hi Tea platter isn't fabulous. Food tasted average. I ordered hot lemon tea n was told to wait as they didn't have enough teapots. The cafe was not even packed to begin with.Service is slow. We only saw 3 staff (including cashier) for the whole floor. They probably need to hire at least one more to help with the needs of the consumers. Overall experience wasn't good n we will spend our money elsewhere. Bill for 3 pax (3 mains, 1 Hi tea platter n 2 drinks) came up to be $151+.

Very cute image of the food. Delivery time was slow. One curry chicken need to wait for more than 30 minutes. The ingredients and cooking was nothing special but the image is the big seller. I just ate a few of small cubes of chicken for the curry chicken rice but cost $19.90. Pancake is normal and it cost $16.99. Can try but not suggests for 2nd attempt. 可爱的主题餐厅。食物摆盘可爱但味道一般。等候食物的时间不短，咖喱鸡饭要等30分钟，但鸡肉只有几粒小鸡丁，马铃薯好像还有些发黑，要价19.90。松饼可爱，但味道一般。可来尝试，但一次就好了。价格偏贵

I had arrived on a Friday evening at 6.10pm but had to wait for approximately 1.5 hours before there were available seats for me and my friends. I had ordered the chicken curry and had to wait for another hour for the food. The food was served lukewarm but I find the taste slightly delectable for a character cafe since the main focus for such concept cafes are usually on the cute interior design rather than the taste of the food. The drinks with the characters on them were rather expensive (approximately $12 and above). If not for the long waiting time, it is a suitable place for families with young children or gatherings with friends
