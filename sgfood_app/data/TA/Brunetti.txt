The food came fast, wide selection of desserts. With Entertainer, the food is very value for money. It was pretty quiet when I went with my friend, so it was a nice place to catch up
4
Good ambience in a busy mall like Tanglin. Good mall to catch up with friends. Food was good. Nice variety.
3
Enjoyable, practical â€” good cookies and average gelato... reasonably good value. Overall good option
1
Very dirty ice cream counter. Also the flavours we wanted were not available this time. No whiskey, no Belgian chocolate, no mint and no rum/raisin. A real disappointment for S$10,50. Expensive!
2
(1) almost no vegetables with dishes (2) should extend lunch sets to dinner
(3) should allow choice of salads or fries or coleslaw with dishes (4) allow added sidedishes for $3 similar to Svensen or Mcdonald.
5
What a fabulous meal and service from Mohammed Taha and his staff. Food was sensational and service exceptional...even to the point of explaining the region of the wines. Gelato was also awesome as recommend by M Taha...my compliments
3
This place is like a cafe style restaurant. Overall, we liked the food there, we had Baked Mac and Cheese and Spicy Prawn Arrabiata.Wanted to sit outdoor, but the outdoor space, I noticed that many tables and chairs have bird droppings. Therefore decided to sit indoor
4
prices on the menu seem a little higher than usual, but prices are nett. Though we've to place orders at the cashier, the wait staff will serve us the food. I wanted to take over my dish as im sitting further away from the wait staff and challenging for him to place my plate properly, but he insisted to place it nicely on the table for me with a smile. Food was great, wanted to try the pistachio gelato but was unfortunately not available. Will be back to try agn
3
Nice cafe for a respite from shopping or to meet friends Patrons are mostly families with young children Counter service with some experienced wait staff (teenage wait staff are in the minority)Pizzas and pasta are main staples for sit down meal Cake counter is well stockedA good alternative to noisy hotel coffee houses serving mass market buffets Worth considering for simple mea
2
the seats (not chairs) were rather smelly. there weren't any service other than serving the food to us. staff don't know about the chope dinner set, except for the female staff. showed the staff the reservations then she says okay. I asked where are the seats and she mentioned free seating. plus staff did not serve any drinks. only four tables were occupied when I was there. the food and service has dropped so much. not recommended
3
The title says it all. The mains are totally underwhelming. We ordered the fish and chips and quesadilla. Enjoyed the waffles with Gelato.
1
Food average. They forgot part of the order. When chased up they eventually served it 10 mins after everyone else had finished their meals, but no apology.
4
Food was up to expectations and the mushroom/truffle risotto was excellent! Staff seems understaffed on day of visit but were nonetheless friendly and eager to serve. Kudos!
5
Everything we needed for brunch - eggs Benedict, profiteroles, gelato... in a spacious comfortable setting :)
4
Excellent service by the service staff. Food portion was good. Quality is above average. Will return again
4
I highly recommend the wagyu burger and the fruity pancakes! We also tried the margharita pizza and the executive breakfast, all were absolutely delicious! Prices were fairly reasonable too! Highly recommended.
3
It was pretty alright. Food ok service ok ambience ok , merely passed but nothing to really draw us back here..
2
Brunetti's is located well and has a back door entrance to Jen Hotel too where one can sit outside as well.Very friendly service. Howver, that is pretty much where it stops. Two ice cream scoops were first served in a small plastic cup with a plastic spoon and then changed to a tea cup when the ice cream overflowed! Had to request a teaspoon too. Cakes are overpriced.Felt sorry for the obliging and apologetic staff who were trying their best
4
Pros- They had other specials available which were actually cheaper than the 1 for 1 deals- staff were very helpful about my vegetarian optionsCons- when i ordered the waiter didnt inform me the fish and chips could come as a set with soup etc-when we found out and asked he said the ala carte set was larger than the set lunch and so I couldnt add on a soup :(- staff initially forgot to deduct my chope discount but did when reminded.- service was slow :( - gelato scoops tiny for the banana spli

Thanks to chope reservation, I managed to enjoy a 1-for-1 deal on the pasta/risotto that's valid throughout the entire month of August! Service wasn't that efficient though with the surprisingly huge crowd on a Monday afternoon. Apparently there's no service charge here and orders are done manually at the counter, much to my surprise for this seemingly high-class restaurant. Nevertheless, I am glad this was the case as it would help me to save up on the extra expenses :P I ordered the black truffle mushroom risotto and gnocchi endamame hazelnut pesto pasta, both of which were satisfying, fulfilling and enjoyable. I personally prefer the mushroom risotto that comes with a light, creamy sauce and generous amount of mushrooms, a chewy and juicy mouthfeel with a pleasant earthy note. The truffle flavour was distinct and aromatic as well. On the other hand, the gnocchi comes with a pesto sauce that was creamy, thick and flavourful but a tad heavy and oily on the palate. The gnocchi was chewy and mochi-like, served with endamame beans and a little melted mozzarella cheese that was thick and gooey. We also tried the waffle and triple scoop gelato for desserts. Feel free to sample the gelato prior to your order, which I did and the samples were given in a generous amount too! The gelato flavours that I had were: salted butter caramel (my favourite), yogurt and dark chocolate on a belgian waffle served with butterscotch sauce. Texture of the gelato was smooth, creamy and melt-in-the mouth kind that I adore. Really love the gelato here though the waffles were just a run-off-the-mill, lacking crispness and fragrance in the batter.
3
Desserts were ok. Pasta and risotto are alright. Experience was so so. Staff service were quite rigid.
1
I came in with my kids to get a simple meal. This stuff is all
Prepared so I thought it would be quick. All the good is displayed, And they still took ages!
4
Great place for desserts and a cuppa. Not too crowded on weekdays so you will not need a reservation
.
5
Good menu and reasonably priced. Highly recommend this establishment for a hearty breakfast or brunch. Loads of choice and food quality and taste if good, and its fresh. Right next to Hotel Jen.
4
I had breakfast at lunch, truffle eggs and sausage. It was fine.
the fresh orange juice tasted a bit off, not sure if they squeezed into the peel?
5
Went to Brunetti last Friday and ordered a pizza. The food was tasty and service the service is excellent. The dessert was great too!
3
Pizza was quite ok, waffle was super soggy, not crispy at all and gelato was not to my liking. Place was quite nice though!
3
The range of food and sweets are much lesser than Australia. There were only 2 to 3 serving staff even during lunch time.
4
The staff has not much understanding what Italian food should be, but what I've got as risotto con truffo was rather good. They suggested adding chicken meat to this risotto which might change completely truffle flavor.This is rather a bar than restaurant and prices are also rather at bar level
5
On a short trip to Singapore, I popped in here 3 times to eat. The menu was great and the food was delicious. I was particularly impressed with the front of house staff, especially "Arlynne". They all remembered my name and treated me very nicely, which is nice when your on your own.Molto bene!!
3
A great ambience for family dining. A la carte menu are slightly pricey and you will need to order and pay, before obtaining a number tag for your order.
3
We had pasta there. the chilli prawn arriabata had many prawns inside that were big and juicy. We saw many cakes in the fridge that looked good. Would love to try it out one day.
4
Brunetti is based in Tanglin Mall, a favorite hang out for the expat community. It serves good food quickly. Often there are lot of kids there, so crying and tantrums do occur...
5
Tried the risotto. Impressed with the quality of the cream mixed together with the rice. Quiet air-conditioned environment. Great place for gatherings.
5
Went with friends. Tried the parma ham pizza, the pesto gnocchi and the alfredo chicken pasta. Food was good, ambience was great too. Would come again!
5
We enjoyed the risotto and the pizzas. Service was good although they were a little slow in giving us the take-away boxes for the pizzas which we couldn't finish.
5
One of the best looking desert counter, this open concept cafe still holds small spaces to be cosy enough for a coffee without being disturb by the traffic. But the one thing that sets this place apart from other cafe is the desert. Afternoon tea is very affordable at under $20 for a cake and a coffee, but the cakes taste as good as it looks interestingly. Give it a go
5
My boyfriend and I were lucky to have made reservation before the kitchen closed. The service crew was very attentive and helpful with showing us with food we can order using the Chope promo... I had Mac & cheese which is honestly one of the best I've ever eaten and my boyfriend had the San Daniele. Both big portions for a reasonable price
3
Redeemed a $1 deal (compliments of Chope) that was valid for pizza, risotto and pasta. The pizza was good (with generous ham serving) but burger was like a half-hearted effort. Guess it's a safer bet to stick to Italian familiarities. And I was charged for the pizza, even though it was supposed to be on a $1 deal. Anyway... A large floor space is dedicated to desserts. May come next time to try that
4
Curiosity pulled me to the pastry showcase of this restaurant looking to see if I could find a gluten free pastry. As I looked at the ingredient list of the interesting orange shaped pastry.. it was indeed GF. It tasted as good as it looked and gave no trouble to my GF kid
5
Went there using a Chope One for one pasta deal. The last time I didn't like their pasta. It's improved now.
3
Food was of good quality, we were pleasantly served. It was a warm birthday celebration for my husband's birthday.
5
Excellent and responsive to special reservation request manager was attentive and customer centric super awesome service !!!!!'
5
Amazing! I love the interior and the promotion was very worth it! Lovely service and really a great place to dine
5
Family friendly restaurant with beautiful cakes on both sides. The pastas were yummy. I loved the hazelnut gelato.
3
Had Pizza, salad, waffle which is great. Great coffee too. Waffle is abit chewy which we like. But service could improve
4
Ordered 2 pastas and thoroughly enjoyed the spinach and ricotta ravioli. Also liked the bruschetta and Mista salad. Nice for a quick lunch on the go.
2
This was once the best cafe in Singapore. In the last years it had started cutting corners in every department. Terrible coffee and service now combine with a truly second rate range of cakes and pastries.Crazily they try bucket of beer promotions to try and attract a crowd they will never see.Once tempting cakes are now a minimal range of badly tempered chocolate cakes and second rate limoncello cheesecakes.The service system changes monthly and only gets worse. I am told the branch in Melbourne is iconic.The branch in Singapore is moronic.Brand guardian needs to stop this rot fast
3
We were surprised to find a Brunetti in Singapore. This is a popular Italian cafe serving coffee, cakes, sweets and gelato in Melbourne. The decor style was similar to the parent as were the dainty pastries and cakes for special occasions. Our eyes were drawn to the croque en bouche. We had to taste test the coffee at least. Unfortunately it was a pale comparison to the barista-made version back in Melbourne. The cappuccino was weak and lack the fragrance of fresh beans and rosetta
5
Nice little place with limited seating. They seem to specialise in Cakes & bakes.Had gone for lunch. Had a very nice menu & lots of vegetarian options & if you can eat eggs you can have a gala time.All things we ordered right form soup, salad, pasta, pizza, pastries, coffee & tea was top notch, Totally worth visiting often
5
Super Italian cafe located in Tanglin Mall on Tanglin Road. Hugely popular with expats, this cafe serve all day breakfasts, lunches and has a wide selection of cakes and deserts.
4
First time to Tanglin
Seems like a place more popular for coffee and cakes and macaroons so perhaps lunch / food not the best. Menus can be updated and improved
4
This eatery is right next to Jen hotel Tanglin and is a good option instead of the hotel. It is in a shopping centre.
4
I went for a simple lunch that came quite quickly. The food is good overall. The cappuccino was average but pastries were good so we packed a few back. Good place for hang out with friends too.
4
The One-eyed Jack is my fav dish especially with a spicy Italian sausage. Coffee is good but the service is so so only.
4
Clean, nice and quiet place for a meal. Had dessert here and it taste pretty good. Price range are reasonable. They have quite a bit of desserts (ice cream / cakes) on display as well.
4
Went with my hubby for brunch ordered 2 sets of breakfast. The truffle scrambled eggs were amazing. Love the coffee as well. By far the good ones I had.
3
The display of cakes makes ones mouth watery we ordered a almond corrisasant. Very yummy till I got to the part when I was trying to slice it something black burnt fell down. The whole experience was spoilt. Finally realized that when they put the crossiant in the oven they probably had not cleaned it properly. They should definetly keep up the standards considering how expensive the pastries are there. Had a Strawberry Sorbet very nice. Unfortunately the bad experience lasted more than the good experience
4
If you are looking for a quick and easy lunch on Tanglin Road then I would recommend Brunettis. They do a pretty brisk trade as this area is popular with ex-pats and locals alike. The Italian menu has many choices and serves are generous. We shared our meals. There are also a multitude of delicious sweets to complete the meal including macaroons. Coffee is good as is the service. They do offer a catering service as well if interested. It's worth dropping in for a coffee and a look through the special cake selections on display. Wow 
4
Visited this restaurant for lunch today.Order and pay at the counter and take your numbered flag. First choice of main was halibut but that was out of stock so settled for chicken.Had pumpkin and butternut soup for starters which was quite good and came with garlic bread. The main event - roast chicken was tasteless and oily. Quite a let down.Dessert of which there is a mighty selection all look very appealing. I had pear cheese cake which was good. The ice cream looks fantastic too - a great variety of flavours.Ambiance is good and there is free wifi
4
Lovely desserts and that's the main draw factor. Food is acceptable but hey, we're all there for the desserts right!
2
Food isn't too bad; gelato is good; ambience esp the outdoor seats is relaxing but the service is poor.
Serving staff are distracted and brusque.
Not recommended except maybe for takeaway gelato.
5
I asked for a variation to their menu. This was no trouble to the staff. Service was excellent. I had two great meals there. loved it.
3
It's really a bit of an expensive cafÃ©. But the cakes and macaroons are really nice. They have these really great looking cakes and there's a very good variety. But a tad expensive to be honest.
3
We went there when they were just opening in the morning, Totally disorganized and breakfast for 2 cost over $50. Coffees arrived after we have eaten our food. I cant say I would recommend this place.
4
Its our first time trying this cafÃ© after non-stop walkin' at Singapore's shopping district. I'd say overrrated. Nevertheless, its a quiet place to chill away fm the busy cafÃ© at Paragon or Ion malls.The Opera Raspberry cake is a heart stopper with its heavenly creaminess (who's shouting diet?!)!! The New York Cheesecake is kinda' dry.....Overall satisfactory and shamelessly cheaper than downunder of course!! Will definitely be back
5
It was our second visit to Brunetti. Today the generous portions of ice cream were most welcome after walking around the Botanic Garden, just a few hundred yards away from Tanglin Court.Whilst my husband opted for ice cream, I could not resist the strawberry cake. I hesitated to put my fork into this little marvel. It was almost a shame to damage this perfectly shaped strawberry. I could only do so after taking a photograph. The taste was as fine the shape. De-li-cious!!We shall no doubt visit Tanglin Court again during our stay in Singapore and I am pleased to learn that the Brunetti story started in Melbourne which we shall be visiting in January
2
The service here is just lousy. Sadly a good western breakfast is tough to find in SG, so I foolishly keep returning for more of the lousy service. Cannot tell you how many times I have had expat spouses openly cut the queue and happily served by staff, undercooked food that needs 45 minutes to be remade, burnt food i am to tired to argue about, and service staff simply pretending you aren't standing in front of them. Overpriced, far lower food quality than what you pay for, and lousy service staff.
4
We been there for quite long time ago.. 2015 July, the place was located at Shopping mall and not easy to see it. The food was nice and a lot dessert for you to choose, is a best place for reading book or chatting with friend's. We love the pizza, coffee & dessert over there..  yummy.
4
We were debating where to go in orchard. Wanted somewhere quiet with good ambience. Settled on Brunetti for the Italian gelato, pizza, pasta and wide range of cakes. This is our first time here. Orders at the counter, free sitting and a few tables empty at around 3pm on a weekday. Welcoming selection of Italian fares from the escalator. Many choices of starters, 2 types of soups, more than 8 pizzas to choose from (1 size only), good variety of pasta n ravioli, vegetarian options are marked with a letter V. Weekday 3-6pm high tea set special at $9. Was certainly a good value. However was not informed about this promotion. Waiter was kind enough to allow a top up with the cake set. When enquired whether there is any card promotion, was told only HSBC credit card. After we were done, and walking out of Brunetti then we saw a A4 advertisement of UOB's 1 for 1 promotion. Alas, the waiter did not even know!Anyway, staff was friendly but seem to lack knowledge esp the cashier. Place seems slightly understaffed on a weekday afternoon. Need to wait at the gelato section to be served.Overall, pasta was 4 stars, pizza (marinara) 5 stars, latte 5 stars, cake & presentation 5 stars. We will be back again but will make sure all card promos were scrutinized before ordering:
4
good food and value for money if you can get mains 1 for 1.
desserts -wide selection and all look so delicious
2
Used to come here often when I lived here! It's been a year and have to say quality of food has definitely deteriorated! Just ordered truffle scrambled eggs (very very dry), tomatoes looked old and my extra bacon was half cooked!! Not happy!
4
The food is nothing to shout about but it has a nice quiet ambience for an early breakfast. Service is rather good.
1
Service was poor, wait staff did not appear to be aware of how to handle use of the entertainer app.
4
This place serves nice cakes and gelato, probably one of the best in the country. I was here twice; tried their pasta and steak, which are overshadow by their superb cakes.
5
My daughter loves this place, especially after a day out visiting Singapore attractions. They also offer a great selection of cakes and savoury food in a nice relaxed setting. If you are staying nearby a visit to Tanglin mall and Brunetti is highly recommended.
4
Great place for such amazing bakery and pastries. Their food menu offers quite a selection and not to mention their gelato too!
4
Great place to hang out for good coffee and a wide variety of tasty desserts. I had afternoon tea with a friend and we found ourselves chatting at the place for over two hours. Good ambience and free wifi available. Will visit the outlet again for sure
3
The pastas are excellent but the staff can probably learn to be better with the menu. We asked for Special Cajun Sweet Potato Fries with Aioli Sauce but normal cajun fries with mayo sauce came. We asked for a change and got sweet potato fries with wasabi sauce. When I checked with the staff, he didn't even know what I was talking about and said that the normal cajun fries were what we had ordered (the menu definitely said sweet potato fries) and they thought we wanted to change our order only after getting it
5
Whether you come here for dinner and just for cake it is well worth a visit. We were surprised about the high quality savoury food given the restaurant is known for cakes. We had salmon and our girls had kids pasta and kids pizza. All delicious and well priced. The cakes were divine of course
5
Situated next door to Hotel Jen so convenient. Clean Restaurant, nice friendly staff Great Meals, pastries, Icecream. Good Service. Gary Nathan
3
This italian joint is rather famed for their macaroons and profiteroles. The cakes look ok too. It's self service so kind of blah. Because it's a cafe, don't expect too much if you have dinner
4
My friends and I dined here for the first time. The food was pretty good, and we like that the place wasn't too crowded on a weekday evening. Prices are reasonable too. Will come back again.
5
We came here for a quick bite and were not disappointed. The food was good, service polite and prompt and you just knew from the moment we sat down that it was going to good. The burger was outstanding
2
We popped in to brunetti as we had walked passed a few times and i wanted to try the cake and icecream. Unfortunately I didn't get to taste them as the service was completely diobolical. We chose to have a meal here so ordered fish and chips and a margarita pizza. Easy order! They brought out the fish and chips in about 10 minutes . No sign of pizza, i told my Mum to start eating as i didn't want her food to get cold. 5 minutes later i asked where my pizza was, waiter looked embarrassed and went to find out came back and said 5 minutes. 5 more minutes no sign of pizza. A waitress asked if we were okay i replied "no i would like my order please. My mum has nearly finished and im still waiting". A table behind us who arrived and ordered after us got their pizza . 5 more minutes passed and i was still waiting. Mum had finished and I hadn't eaten. Nearly 30 minutes after i ordered it my pizza arrived. The waiter kept saying i will pass comments onto my manager. I will let them know. They knocked 15% off the bill for the inconvenience which was $5.40 I decided not to have dessert here as didn't fancy another long wait so i can't tell you about the cakes and gelato.
5
An indulgence for the weekend, a satisfying brunch option with family or friends, especially loving the Eggs Benedict and their range of very palatable pastries and desserts. The ambience and decor augments the dining experience, a neat and quiet restaurant despite located in the hustle and bustle of the city center
3
A small group of colleagues and I came by after hearing there was a Brunetti's in Singapore. A Melbourne icon so I had to go! I was a bit disappointed, the cakes et al on offer were lovely but the coffee was not great. I would come back, but only due to the location
3
Have always love this restaurant and their food. Though not Michelin star quality but the ambience and environment is great for meal with children. I can see that the level of service has went downhill and I can understand it is probably due to not enough staff working. Management should look into this as it will be a shame for brunette to go under.
3
Have been here abt 3 times. Hot drinks are good, very wide variety of sweets, bakes etc. Ice cream looks good. I find the staff unfriendly..always feel like they are impatient when i order at the counter. Breakfast portion small for the price and burger super dry. Juices are good but expensive!
4
I had a long mac topped up and the chocolate flourless cake (not because it was flourless, but because I love chocolate) and my partner had the profiteroles. They were both delicious and I'd go back. I can't remember how much they were to be honest. My friend had the strawberry sponge cake and it tasted stale unfortunately. Overall, lovely place for good coffee and desserts. Their menu looked good and there was a lunch special as well. Check it out !
4
We had a business lunch at Brunetti. THey had a good selection of italian food. It is however more like a coffee and dessert place. Service was reasonable and so was the food.
4
I was staying at the Hotel Jen and popped in to Brunetti for a late night gelato snack. It was well worth the visit!
5
One of the favorite Gelato i always go for in Singapore is here. Love love love. Unfortunately today they don't make the Orange Gelato. The combination of Cappuccino and Orange Gelato is the best for me.
5
Perfect refresher for hot S'pore weather, and a break from the rain! Many flavors and you can taste test!
4
This restaurant was vey convenient for our hotel, there was a link to the mall from floor two.We both had pizza and a bottle of wine. Food was vey good, nice thin crispy crust on the pizza.While we were there, Terence was cleaning tables. I have seldom seen anyone as thorough. Even cleaning the sides and edges of the tables. He is an asset to Brunetti's as much as the food
4
Brunetti Singapore is part of the Melbourne, Australia chain of cafes. It is definitely the place for those with a sweet tooth....the wide array of cakes was very temptingly displayed. Lunch dishes were average and so was the coffee, it could be stronger. Glad I saved space for cakes, thanks to my host. It was delightful. Nice place to while the time away
4
Small breakfast menu, but adequate, prices reasonable about the same as any modern city. Hollaindaise sauce not very true to authentic but toasts etc all delicious. Butters yummy with truffles. Large range of sweets etc, we sat outside so not too hot actually under large overhang of building so cool. Staff attentive
2
We are occasional guests and sat outside on a Saturday afternoon but the space was soon invaded by a group of about six or seven kids who were sent outside by their parents. The kids processed to rum amok, scream, crash into tables and doors and generally ruin lunch for the diners outside. Meanwhile their own parents enjoyed a relaxing meal inside.I mentioned it to one of the waiters as we left and he said they had also caused him difficulty with the trays of food but he had not intervened. He said he would report my concern to his Manager.We have high spirited kids ourselves who were present and we understand what family friendly means but this was beyond anything reasonable, the area was treated like a playground. I regret not approaching the parents when it started. The staff should sharpen up and look after all the customers. These customers should be more considerate of others
2
I was disappointed with Brunetti. I bought the entertainer book and it has a buy one get one main meal free. They told me that the club sandwich and the burgers are not considered main meals...only pasta, pizza and 3 other dishes. REALLY? Pretty pathetic and inflexible given that they are same price as some of the pizza's
5
As cafÃƒÂ© owners we were keen to find good coffee in Singapore and we found it at Brunetti's. Our DiBella account manager recommended us to go there and we were not disappointed fantastic coffee, great breakfast, and chocolates and cakes to die for. Reasonable prices too
4
We ate pizzas and gelati. The variety was good and the standard was high. It was a little pricey but all good quality with good service.
4
I only popped in the evening to get coffee & pastry to take back to my hotel. Good service, coffee and delicious pastr Large seating are.y. Serves Italian style food well in to the evening.
5
Good coffee and great quality breakfast at a reasonable price. The cheese cake was one of the best we have had !!
3
Stopped at brunetti's at tangling mall. Initial service from regularly dressed waiters were very nice and warm. I felt totally welcome. Didn't feel too bad that my young daughter was making a bit of a racket too, however as she got noisier , decided to sit outside. While I finished my salad I ordered a drink and a rather dapper and ninja like waiter all dressed in black brought it for me and said I have to pay for it then and there. And then he even asked me if my lunch had been paid for ., I said no as I am still in the midst of it.. And then he said he will check on it.. And asked my nice server at the start to bring my bill. So I paid for my lunch .. Decided no more to be ordered!! The other staff apologised and said that the ninja server in black had requested for my bill!!! After that I just couldn't even enjoy the rest of my meal! But I made sure I finished it!! Food so-so! Value for money I would say .. But so wish this one individual didn't spoil the overall experience!! Not sure if he didn't like the colour of my skin, as none of the other tables got their bills before finishing!! I definitely won't return!
3
Whenever we drive past Tanglin Mall, we will be attracted by this huge advertisement poster of Brunetti. Decided to visit this place.I went today. The ambience of the place is good. There is a choice of indoor and outdoor seating. There were customers but not noisy so you will still be able to hold a conversation properly.The menu has good range of cooked food, desserts and drinks. They serve breakfast too (8:30-11:30)am.My husband ordered the tenderloin. The portion was decent but he felt that the steak was average. We have to bear in mind, this place does not specialize in steak. I was attracted by the range of desserts, they look appealing. There is gelato, chocolates, pastries, cakes, macaroons, etc... What I like about the desserts is that they have minuet and normal sizes. This is good for me because I can order a variety and eat by myself as my husband does not have sweet tooth!The desserts are acceptable.We ordered a coffee, it was good too. It was not too strong.
5
Living in Melbourne, I've been spoiled by the abundance of great cafe's around the city. One thing I dread as a traveller is finding good coffee when overseas. I can confidently say that Brunetti's delivers the goods in Singapore. Although its not cheap, the coffee is rich with good crema. The baristas know how to make the goods and its worth spoiling yourself with some pastries. If Staying at the Regent, it's just next door to Brunetti's and you're set for a great day.
4
Whenever I stay at the Jen Hotel Tanglin, I do try to squeeze in a breakfast at the Brunetti. They do have the best egges benedict in town! Service is soso, it is setup for ordering inside, but if you sit outside there are waiters roaming around to take your orders. However, they are not always very responsive, could improve on that by getting them in a more proactive behaviour
1
Okay,I have been to this coffee shop in Tanglin a few times. And it is fine as a coffee shop.But hey, it is pretending to be italian. So maybe they can cook italian?No no no, they cannot even cook pizza.Very far off. If you are listening management, have you heard of herbs???Seemingly not!The worst pizza I have tasted in a long time.Quite horrid!!!!You can make coffee, but I am evaluating you on dinner. Very, very bad!Just get coffee and cake. Fake italian but they can do coffee and cake (bought in)
4
We ate here on a Tuesday when and they had a buy one get one free deal on pizza's. We decided to go for a pizza each and some fries and were both very please with the quality and quantity of food! The dessert selection was amazing and we each had some ice cream which was delicious and I got some chocolates to take away.The whole the was very reasonable (especially for Singapore) and all in all very good. Would visit again if I am ever back in Singapore
5
Be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner, Iâ€™m a regular at Brunettiâ€™s.Located in Tanglin Mall, with access to the thruway/ courtyard shared with the Hotel Jen, Brunettiâ€™s offers something for everyone: families, work, casual dining. With free WiFi and outdoor air-conditioned seating I think youâ€™d be hard pressed to come up with many negatives for this cafÃ©.The pastries are fantastic and coffee is very good. I was particularly impressed with the Pork Chop on the lunch/ dinner menu. One of the better chops in Singapore for a fraction of the price of other restaurants.Some tips â€“ get the Brunetti club and enjoy 15% of your bills. Call ahead to order pizzas for pickup. Also, the most impressive and reasonably priced birthday cakes.
4
Its a well small place and in a mall but seems to attract a steady clientele most of whom are waiting for someone. It has order on the counter and coffee brought to you style Good variety and a decent place
4
Interior of the cafe is very Italian. Their cakes and pastries are one of the best in town. Sinful sweet indulgence anytime! Bravo!
5
Brunetti's gelati is sensational - always something new to tempt you and if you are still hungry there's the patisserie!

If you didn't have breakfast included in your Hotel Jen stay, eat here. Great coffee, and surprisingly good food brekkie options (waffles, full english, lots of pastry things etc). After breakfast they do decent "Italian" type things (paninis, pasta, etc). But save yourself for cake or their gelato
3
For people from Melbourne Australia the name Brunetti equates to lovely Italian cakes and pastries with the possibility of a nice ice cream. While some of this is available in Brunetti in Tangling Mall the offerings are much more limited than in Melbourne. Staff are friendly and do their best. Overall we have come to expect better than what was on offer at Brunetti in Tangling Mall
3
Arrived early with a friend although dinner was planned for 7pm. Decided to try the afternoon tea set which ends at 6pm and it's a slice of cake with tea, coffee or iced tea for $9.90. Afternoon set was great with quite a few choices of pastries. However dinner choices were disappointing. We ordered mushroom/chicken pasta (can't remembered the exact name of the dish), mushroom risotto and Saint Daniel salad. The pasta and risotto were bland even after salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese were added. The dishes smell great but the pasta was dry and not cooked al dente. I would go back for only the pastries or afternoon tea set

If you like gelato or quality cakes, Brunetti is the place to go.We stumbled across it while seeking Air Conditioning walking back to our hotel.Tanglin Mall as a small boutique Mall with a small variety of shops and a supermarket in the basement; as well as Brunetti.Brunetti (as the name suggests) is an Italian themed cafÃ© serving beautiful cakes and exquisite ice-creams, but it also serves a savoury selections and a wide variety of hot and cold drinks.The walls are decorated with black and white scenes from Italian 1960â€™s cafÃ© culture (including one of Sophia Loren, if I remember correctly) and accompanied by a white tiled floor and black and white cafÃ© furniture.The waiters (who are all very professional) finish the scene perfectly in their classic waiterâ€™s uniforms that would not look out of place in any quality restaurant in London, Paris, Milan or Rome.It is not a cheap place to visit, but well worth a visit for singles, couples and families that like naughty treats and good quality.The next time I am in Singapore, I fear I will visit again :-
4
Lots of competition in Tanglin Mall for the expat dollar. Brunetti is good, not outstanding. We had a pizza, Stagione (I think) that was good. Hot, crispy base and deep flavours. The Caesar salad was a little heavy on dressing, perhaps ask for dressing on the side. One complaint...the service is not great. The servers who took orders were a little brusque and were quite rude to another customer. I would have walked off! Advice: wait in the queue near the till. Otherwise you are not in the line and won't get served. Avoid sitting outside where there are lots of birds in the fake trees, waiting to plop milk into your long black.
4
Breakfast treat. Delicious eggs benedict.Daughter had the pancakes which she loved. Also many sweet treats to choose from.This is a popular cafe for a lot of the expat wives with too much time on their hands. Prices are high though but Nice to visit once in a while
5
My husband and I love to have our cappuccino at Brunetti. The pastry is excellent.The service staff need some straining. Perhaps, because they are understaffed due to Spore's hiring rules on hiring foreign labor that the current staffs feel overworked. They do not do their work from their heart
4
Went there for tea with my sis. There are plenty of cake and pastry. Food is not bad, service is okie but lovely ambiance. We had nice and relaxing afternoon there, Its an Italian restaurant, we will go back for pasta and pizza next time.
3
The spaghetti carbonara is quite nice. The coffee is pretty good. The service, however, can be frequently uneven, excruciatingly SLOW and irritatingly indifferent. Sometimes the vibe is that they are somehow doing the customers a favour by serving us at all. A few servers are nice and friendly. Others are surly and insincere.
3
To be honest I had a bad experience last weekend. I ordered a medium rare tenderloin and I was served what seemed to me like a flat piece of leather - and I suspect that it's a piece of cheap rump steak. Tenderloin? Looked nothing like the picture. When I asked to return the steak, I was told that it was the last piece- really? At 4pm? So I cancelled the steak and ordered a pizza instead. While the desserts were decent, I should warn you that unless you like birds walking on your table to try and steal your food(as well as the potential hygiene factors involved), do not sit outdoors, as tempting as it may look
4
I loved the smiling faces and welcoming attitude of sales boys/girls. Food is really nice fresh. I ordered Latte Macchiato which was much better than other cafes around. Sitting arrangement is good and the place is big enough to cater a small get together, They even have an outdoor place which can sit 20-40 people.The only down side is the environment.the aircon was very noisy. It was difficult to hear the person next to you. Besides being noisy it does n't work properly. It was warm even in the early afternoon when the restaurant was not even half full.Overall it's a good place to go but be prepared for a walk or a bus ride if you are taking public transport. If you are driving you might have to park in a nearby plaza
4
This is a lovely little restaurant with delicious fresh pastries. We had a glass of wine and a pastry on the patio on a Sunday morning and it was delightful. There are lots of families and it makes it feel very homey. Service is good and very friendly. Nice way to spend a Sunday morning
4
Having both indoor and outdoor seating, this is great for a long weekend brunch, it is family friendly and the table outside are great for the kids to run around. We also met several friends here at different times. We sat from breakfast till lunchtime, and everyone can order their own food and drinks, the laid-back atmosphere also made it easy for people to join in and out of our group as they arrived/left. We loved the eggs benedict and their coffees and cakes were excellent. The table next to us recommended the cheesecake and boy, was it good! As we sat outside, it was confusing to see the menu laid out on the tables only to told by the staff that it is a self-service restaurant. Also, depending on your service staff, they may bring you a glass of water or point it out to you to get yourself. Over-all experience was very good but could use some consistency on the table service or the absence of it

Brunetti is an Italian cafe (or Roman Pasticerria) that interestingly started in Australia and has many outlets there now. It expanded internationally and now at Singapore's very own Tanglin Mall, we have a branch serving aromatic coffee, delectable-looking pastries and lovely gelato! The cafe's decor is rich in authentic Italian flavor and hues, transporting one to another world literally.I chose to try the Cappuccino (SGD$6.50) which had a lovely taste to it, as Italian brew goes.Although we were full from lunch, we just couldn't resist some pretty little desserts at Brunetti. Hence, it was a good thing that they have these dainty miniatures of the original cake slices. We had a mini Lemon Tart, mini Opera Cake and Mud Cake Mignon at a mere SGD$2.90 each.The Lemon Tart was pretty good - refreshing citrusy lemon curd surrounded by a crumbly crust that was light and fragrant with butter taste.The Opera Cake was pretty good as well, the almond and coffee gelled really well together to give the cake a sweet union of flavors.As for the Mud Cake Mignon, it was a little disappointing because the cake was very hard and dry in texture. The chocolate taste was redolent but the hardness of the cake did not sit well with us.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/03/afternoon-tea-at-brunetti-cafe-tanglin.htm

This has one of the most attractive displays of cakes I have seen. They taste as good as they look- fortunately I was only able to visit twice on a short stay in Singapore. The icecreams are also excellent with plenty of choice.Well worth coming to visit
4
Came because we heard that the dessert is good and it is! We ordered Baci di Dama, lemon tart, chocolate eclair and an iced latte to share. Would recommend to come back for all that I have tried. The service was also pretty good, just that I had to wait for a while before I was being attended because of the queue in front of me. Sat outside, do not recommend because of pigeons walking about... Not a fan of birds at places where food is consumed.
3
We had one for one main course coupon. We got risotto and a pizza. Vegetarian Risotto - can be better as I feel not soft enough but the taste is good. Pizza - a very large old Chang Kee curry puff like pizza with mozzarella cheese, ham and raw egg. Tasted quite ok but the raw egg really not my type. Dessert we had lemoncello, taste good but texture to be improved. I heard their opera cake is good but it was sold out during my visit
4
I loved the little cakes that they have - excellent sugar fixes! Their pasta dishes are good and reasonably priced. However, it is the wide selection of pastries, cronuts, and ice cream that I regulary bought from here.
4
The only good coffee in Singapore!!! Very similar to Brunetti in Melbourne. Cakes were excellent, coffee good. Most coffee in Singapore was dreadful ie Starbucks and expensive ($5-$7 per cup compared to $3.50-$4 Australian) but at Brunetti coffee is tasty.
5
Emm.... just love their desserts. Can't believe they actually have a dessert that has all the ingredients that I love = Pistacchio + Hazelnut. Perfect combination. The best part was, it all came with this little surprise. A mini bucket with my favorite baby blue color too. How could I not fell for it?Of course, something that pretty and delicious need to accompanied with a good Italian coffee isn't? So I got myself a cup of Piccolo latte, just a good size to serve me for the day.While sitting there, I saw many people takeaway something in a big box. I was curious to know what it was. It called French King Cake/ Galette des rois. So I takeaway a slice to try it for the first time. The filling was made by almond, the pie was delicious.Every staff seems pretty busy at the cafe which was understandable. However one of them was from Johor Bahru Malaysia. I had a brief chat with him, quite a friendly person. I will revisit Brunetti, also to try out their weekday afternoon tea time special set promo too
2
Boasts new chefs but none were in sight: new table service but no waiters in sight either. And beware the all-day breakfast. Most of the items are only available until midday. Panini and baguette were mediocre at best and overpriced. Stick with the cakes and coffee
4
Brunetti is a fanastic easy place if you have pets or a young family. There is plenty of space in the al fresco area for hyperactive toddlers to run free. The food's great too. We are a big fan of the fish and chips, the truffle mac & cheese and the myriad of gelato flavours which greet you as you enter the cafe. The italian pastries are also fantastic, as is the coffee.
1
We went here because "the ice cream is good" and my wife had had a nice coffee as well. We had lunch. BIG BIG mistake. We waited an age the realized we had to get our own menus. We had three different waiters non of whom were in the least bit interested in serving us, we ordered two paninis and a fish and chips. Despite there being 5-6 things on the all day breakfast only two of them actually are all day! We got literally two paninis - one on each plate, very sad looking, no garnish and barely any filling. The fish and "chips" came in a basket. Heavily overcooked fish to disguise the poor flavour and fries that had seen better days and certainly a lot fresher cooking oil. They were truly horrid. We may go back but only to eat the very nice looking desserts. We will never try the savoury food again
3
After Walking from Sheraton Towers a to the St Regis and Dropping the bags off we enjoyed the Gelato(lime and Cappuccino) and a pot of tea (even got a sneaky water refill and it was still good). Chocolate penguin as well.Average for the price though pretty good overall
3
Wonderful selection of cakes and desserts with great coffees and drinks. We had a marvelous caramel chocolate invention in a foil cup and the lemon meringue pie with smooth flavorsome chai latte.We wouldn't recommend the mains though - Forgettable and uninspiring! Service is rushed and impatient
4
I know I shouldn't but I had to...I had to stop at my favorite Melbourne escape, whilst in Singapore. Now Brunetti is my way of escaping the daily grind back in Melbourne and whilst I specifically promised myself I would abstain from Brunetti for my week off, I caved. For me it's about the affair with "the escape". My weekly, (sometimes daily) hit. It's not about the coffee which I agree in Singapore is woefully expensive for a "Porchetta" style cappuccino but it is amazing to see Brunetti continue to charm in Singapore despite the expense.And charm it does, very well. Why, because it is colourful, kid and adult friendly and provides a story, or many stories. I look around and there are 100 people. My wonderful tolerant waiter was efficient and polite and supplied me with endless photo opportunities despite the crazy roar of groups.I love Brunetti.....As I loved the Myer cafeteria when I was little. They both provided an escape and for now my affair with Brunetti secretly continues
1
We ordered a birthday cake for delivery the next day for our son, called up the following day to check if the cake was ready. By the time we hung up and walked over to the store in 30 minutes the cake was apparently sold to another customer and the staff was not even apologeti
4
Certainly the best coffee I had during my stay in Singapore. The weather was warm so the gelato was very refreshing. Lots of cakes and pasta on offer too. A great spot to take a break and plan the next foray into the shops.
5
Very enjoyable place to eat, the wild mushroom risotto was my favourite , the cakes and macaroons very delicious, the staff were friendly but took their time.handy when shopping in the mall to pop in I would return.
4
Great coffee and the usual range of delicious cakes, plus all-day breakfast. My scrambled eggs with toasted sourdough were excellent. The food is great, but very over-priced. An espresso cost the equivalent of AUD$5.60. I wouldn't pay that here in Melbourne, no matter how good the coffee.
2
From the outside, and even as you walk inside, Brunetti appears to offer everything on needs to sate a Saturday morning coffee craving, and at $8.77 (incl GST) for a Large Latte, you would think the coffee standard would be pretty good, however you would be sadly mistaken. The Coffee is woeful, especially considering the price.As for the Croissant that accompanied my coffee, legally speaking I wonder if it can be termed a croissant. I am sure when the baker threw his standard bread dough in to the Croissant shaped tin, he was struck with a chill down his spine, as if millions of french voices suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.The place looks lovely and I am sure the cakes and sweets are fine, but the Coffee (and croissant shaped bun) is (are) woeful
3
The coffees here are excellent, and a very quaint Australian Italian cafe ambience.I recommend the mushroom dishes like risotto or the pasta, which are executed well, while the other items are pretty meh. The pizzas are pretty average as well.Go wild on the desserts too, they have a huge range from macaroons to cakes to gelato
3
From the moment it opened, it became a favourite with expats and locals .. as an upmarket italian-style cafe ..I would expect also commensurate service ; yes business is brisk ..but there is no need for rudeness. You have an amazing choice of patisserie ..but for 20% less you can eat one floor below at Cedele The outdoor area is perfect for families ..so it can get noisy .
4
We visited here on a Friday night for dinner and was very impressed by the food selection and quality. We had the Baked Mac and Cheese which my kids absolutely loved, the spinach ravioli and a cheese pizza, all dishes tasted very authentic. The selection of pastries and desserts are to die for, tasted great and a good way to finish off the dinner. However, the service was very hit and miss and we requested cutlery and plates many times and it took very long for them to bring it. There was a case where I had to get up myself to bring it from the counter. We used the entertainer app and got 1 main course for free (saving of around $21) all in all a good experience
1
We stayed at the Regent close by and thought we would have lunch at Brunetti's.The service was poor, the food excepting some of the cakes was well below an acceptable standard. There were flies in the establishment, and the food handing was questionable.Over all, a very disappointing experience, not comparable with Brunetti's in Melbourne, when I complained about the 40 minute wait, the service improved marginally, terrible
3
The food was great, no contest on that but the experience was all tainted due to the rude manager. I qued up for long, only to be treated like trash by the manager. My sweet macarons turned sour... If i see him again there, i won't hesitate to turn away
4
We recently stayed at The Regent and were very happy when we stumbled across Brunettis in the Tanglin Mall next door to us. We often go in Melbourne and we loved it in Singapore. The cakes and the coffees were exactly like Melbourne though coffee is very very expensive at $8. Gelati was very good and similarly priced to Melbourne. We had dinner there one night eating pasta and pizza and they were both very good and for the four of us including drinks cost around $130 AUD which is reasonably priced. If you are after good coffee and yummy cakes come here
4
Brunetti is located in Tanglin Mall. Their menu has a few pizzas, pastas and a bit more but their speciality is coffee and desserts.
They have some very good desserts and gelato. The lemon meringue tart was very nice.
5
Coming from Australia I was shocked to pay SGD$8+ for a Soy Latte but the amazing cakes and treats made up for the expensive but good coffee.
5
Enjoy the best macaroons and the most delicious lemon ice tea you'd have! They actually mix the tea with a scoop of Lemon Sorbet to get the flavour in. I had an enjoyable evening, so close to Orchard road, yet some peace and quiet.
5
For Aussie expats, Brunettiâ€™s is a little oasis. Love the entire look and feel of the place, which has been faithfully recreated here in Tanglin. Iâ€™ve visited many times, but never for food --- the coffee and pastries are the drawcard for me.
5
This was a hidden gem in the middle of Tanglin Mall. We travelled from Swissotel (City Hall MRT) to Orchard MRT and then walked along Orchard Rd to Brunetti's, after reading great reviews by Lady Iron Chef on the Internet. We enjoyed the unique cronut (a mix between a donut and a croissant) and a delicious strawberries and cream eclair. The choux pastry melted in your mouth. Well worth a visit. The coffee was the best one we had in Singapore. The only problem we faced was choosing what to eat as it all looked so fantastic
4
The restaurant is located in the Tanglin Mall just behind Traders Hotel.I frequented the Mall fairly regularly during my stay and this business seemed busy irrespective of the time of day. While I was stunned, initially, at the price of coffee, I soon learned as I went to other venues, the coffee price here was fairly normal for Singapore, and this coffee was far superior to most other restaurants/cafes I tried. The cake selection is just so tempting to resist .......
4
Can only comment on the coffee & ice cream but both were fantastic!! Coffee was very smooth, not bitter at all. Large variety of gelato & sorbets which will appeal to kids of all ages. Cakes looked great as did the food, will definitely be back for a meal soon
2
I'm a huge fan of brunetti's in Melbourne and was excited to see on Singapore's shores. Unfortunately, I find the pastries and hot chocolate to be a disappointment. The long black is still good thankfully. The hot chocolate wasn't as rich as its Melbourne counterpart and the pastries ( including the opera cake) are just as poor. The cake even felt a little soggy, unlike brunetti's normal standard. For this price, I had expected more of brunetti Singapore. It would be disappointing for those lured by the brand name of Brunetti.
2
Came with my hubby for a nice dinner. This visit was anything but nice. I ordered an iced latte and my hubby ordered orange juice. Iced latte came in a milkshake glass and over flowing. I asked for a regular glass and poured my latte in it infront so they see it was a hassle. My hubbies orange juice tasted from a bottle. Fresh juice.. I think not. I ordered the spinach and ricotta cannoli or something like that. Marinara sauce was cold and the pasta was hard. Husband ordered the peas and ham risotto. Very buttery but the peas tasted fresh. So far, give you props on fresh peas. Desserts were good and had many mini versions. Place was nice from the outside but there was pasta and trash on floor, we sat at 3 different tables because they were all wobbly. Here comes the worst part, for our desserts we asked for 2 glasses of water. I was about to drink my water and noticed there was lipstick marks on my glass. Completely gross. Very unclean place.. Would not go there again and would NOT recommend anyone to go there just based on hygiene and well the food flat out sucks. I feel I am very fair with my ratings and rarely give places a bad score but that dirty glass with someone else's lipstick pushed me over the edge. Thumbs down.

Hi ,After visiting enormous restaurants and trying .... a lot of pastas.... I finally found the taste I was looking for. This restaurant served the best fettuccine I have ever had during my travels. The taste was authentic as I have always expected . Also I would like to mention about the new menu that has been introduced offers great stuff. Do visit Brunetti whenever you visit Singapore for heavenly food. Bon Apetit
4
If you are looking to start your day with a Power Breakfast, with good ambiance and top quality food. Look no further. MUST TRY and you would come again for more!
4
it is a bistro type of restaurant with semi-selfservice. menu is short (pasta, risotto, chicken, etc, they have a kids menu) but quite good and of good value. great for coffee and sweets. ok ambience.
check my other reviews of Singapore restaurants.
3
We ate at Brunetti's three times, twice for breakfast and once for an evening snack and coffee. The first two were fine, good even, though the coffee is expensive. Very nice pastries too (a combination of croissant and doughnut. But, and it's a big but, our third visit for our second breakfast was not good. We arrived at 8.20am, to find the place didn't actually serve food until 8.30am. However the person taking our order said it was fine and to go ahead, the kitchen could produce toast straightaway. We actually waitied until 8.35am for the toast. We consumed half of it but, on turning over one slice I found it was really mouldy. Both toast sets were in fact mouldy (and only toasted on one side). My complaint was quickly dealt with and a refund of the cost of the toast offered. But breakfast was spoiled. My view is that a top class place (apparently) should have offered a full refund for breakfast. It's not small thing to be offering mouldy toast after all. I run a small hotel myself so know very well how things ought to be. Smiles and apologies are not enoug
5
I tried the latte before at their Carlton outlet and learned that they have a shop in SG which is not far from my workplace. Well the small cup of latte is quite pricy for me, but it's still the best latte in SG from my point of view
5
The first thing you'd notice when you walk past this neat little cafe in Tanglin Mall is their Display of Desserts. The colourful Gelatos greet you at the entrance, followed by a row of pastries and snacks that tempt you. When you sit down and look at the menu, you're torn between buying the whole lot of pastries or their cooked dishes.I'm a big fan of their truffled scrambled eggs, which is just great for breakfast or brunch. The food in general is really delicious, no doubt about that.Just one small problem - the service is a little slow (compared to other cafes and restaurants in Singapore.) We had to wait around fifteen minutes for breakfast to be served, but that's not a bad thing - that's your chance to walk over to the dessert counter to get a few of those awfully tempting macaroons, cakes or biscuits to satisfy that craving inside you! Not the gelato though, that might leave you too full for breakfast! You can always come back for that when you're done walking around the mall.In all, a great place for breakfast and brunch, but not if you're too hungry to wait! As with the other eateries in that area, be prepared to pay a little more
5
Visited this cafe as we were staying at Traders Hotel in Singapore. We did not have a meal there but we had excellent coffee with mouth watering cakes, just as good as the ones we ate in Paris.I am very particular with the way my coffee is made, well, it came perfect every time. The young people that work there are most efficient and friendly. The gelato is great too. Well worth a visit
5
We have just spent four days in Singapore and I went to Brunetti three times. What a culinary delight. Their presentation of mouth watering delights from wraps, bruchettas, cakes, cakes more cakes and cookies, not to mention the ice creams, is not to be missed. Service with a smile and the coffee was also good. What more could you ask for, a real find in Singapore
5
I was staying at the Traders hotel and one evening decided to venture to the Tanglin Mall it was near to closing time, i.e. 8:45 and the food court was closed down :( I hadn't had any dinner and well, I thought what the heck, I'll try the Gelato, it looks pretty good! I had a medium cup of the very dark chocolate with chocolate chunks inside, it was AWESOME!!!! I just spent a week in Italy last September and I can tell you the Gelato I had a Brunetti was better than any of the Gelato that I had in any of the cities I visited in Italy, just sayin. It was rich and creamy and not too sweet I could have eaten half a gallon vs. half a cup, but it was worth the calories for sure! Check them out if you are in the area ;
4
We stopped by Brunetti for a late breaKfast on Subday morning. Place was quite busy. I ordered a mushroom omelette while my son ordered an Italian breakfast. My omellte came with salad, sausage and bread. My son's Italian breakfast had scrambled egg, beans, sausage, and salad. Inspire of having a huge appetite, He did not finish as he was quite full. They also had a huge selection of cakes and pastries. This is a good find for a hearty breakfast
5
After stopping off at Traders Hotel for the last 3 days we've been wanting to come to Brunetti since we arrived!It's vast array of cakes of all types and colours are amazing as are they tasting!!!Had a Beer, milkshake and 3 cakes with the mrs and came to S$38 - This being what you'd expect in a location next to a hotel.This place is always busy (a good sign) and best off if you sit in doors in the air con. Outside although covered is stuffy and the pigeons are a bit of a pain.Avoid weekends if you don't like the running around of kids... But to be expected when they are off from school.A good place for a coffee (or beer in my case!) and a bit of cake or 3!!!! LOL :)Enjoy!!
5
beautiful looking cakes andd pastries, but we were never there at snack time! really convenient if staying at adjoining traders hotel.
5
Everything here is a must to try, from macaron to all things Italian, I mean desserts could be found here. I love their breakfast menu too, it's just sumptuous
4
This is a great place ( an Australian Chain), located in a mall, that offers inexpensive Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or just a pastry and expresso or great Gelato!! You can dine in with the family or take some to your hotel or home and enjoy.
2
Very nicely decorated, hunger inducing food/cakes looking great inside those displays but the positives stop there. For the price I was paying, I was expecting better cakes & food but apparently, it stopped short. Very short.
5
Fantastic selection of cakes and gelato. Macaroons are to die for especially the salted caramel ones
3
good for casual meals- latte and cakes. Not quite the same a Brunetti in Melbourne if indeed owned by same owners. On a very hot day I imagine the outside tables may pose a problem because of the heat.
4
A nice place to have desserts, a wide range of variety cakes and pastries. They have some good ice creams as well. Macaroons were also pretty as well together with pralines. Overall a good place to chill and hang out.
3
I visited Brunetti, Singapore, twice on my short stop-over in Singapore last month. On the first occasion, I arrived early in the morning after a sleepless flight from Europe. I ordered a double-shot cafe late in a mug - probably the most expensive coffee I've ever ordered. But it was worth it, because it lifted my thumping headache and made me feel human once again.On the second occasion, I arrived late morning and this was a mistake. Brunetti was filled with mums with their toddlers, as well as two breast feeding mums. Happy, normal confusion reigned and I felt completely out of place. I was sitting outside and the noise level was elevated by the children's playground of the Trader's Hotel opposite. There were screeches of joy from the children as they played on the equipment and their mums enjoyed the companionship of other mums. Both the Hotel and Brunetti share a long outdoor area which is enclosed by a high roof and it is the tunnelling effect which I suspect increases noise levels.I checked inside Brunetti and there is a loud, permanent machine-like noise there. I'm not exactly sure what causes it.I'm sorry to be so negative about the noise. If you can call in at quiet times you'll enjoy yourself . When I visit a coffee shop - and I do so often in Melbourne - I enjoy reflecting, catching up with my reading, or simply calming down and chatting quietly with a friend over a high quality coffee
4
These guys have their original restaurant in Lygon Street in Melbourne, Australia (or so I'm led to believe). When I got there for breakfast recently, the coffee aromas and the l-o-n-g counter full of cakes, doughnuts and other to-die-for pastries was stunning. Forget those airy doughnuts from those doughnut shops...the one at Brunetti's are doughy, almost brioche-like and real bits of sugar. This is a robust doughnut that you have to bite into and just savour...love 'em! I'm not doing justice to the dozens of other party varieties...go look for yourself and tell me that that's not a selection and a half.The breakfast are pretty good too. The truffled scrambled eggs are nice and creamy, obviously done at a lower temperature so as not to turn them into yellow eggy-flavoured rubbery shards. Other items on the menu include ranch eggs with bacon tomato and usual fry-ups served in the pan, scrambled eggs with polenta...ooh, yummo. The coffee...well, if that's all you have at Brunetti's, it was worth the visit
5
Quite simply one of the best breakfasts ive ever had: Scrambled eggs served on polenta mash with an italian rustic sausage and shavings of truffle! Excellent coffee and a mouthwatering selection of desserts and ice creams. If staying in Traders hotel it is right next door backing on to the main f&b outlet on the ground floor. Delicious
