It’s been a Long time since I last had a French meal and this was all worth it. I had the beef tartare and it was fresh and well put together with little or no mayonnaise and a little mustard.

I always enjoy dining at Brasserie Gavroche and it has become my french restaurant of choice n Singapore. The food is always great and the prices are not over the top.

If your are looking for something classic, cosy and yummy, you will enjoy Brasserie Gavroche. The service is good and attentive and is a good place to chill for the night.

A very good ambience taking you out of Singapore and into France. Service was friendly and attentive. The food we had was high quality. Great cold cuts with fantastic pate and excellent steak tartare and salads. Wines are awesome.
4
Good food, good wines, good service. Cheeseboard was disappointing: both selection and quality. We love to come to Gavroche and would definitely be coming again. It's a great combination of relaxed athmosphere, attentive service and authentic food. We also love the house selection of brandies.

We recently ate here for dinner and had an absolutely delicious meal. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it is very authentic (makes you feel as if you are in France, rather than on the other side of the world!), It is a very nice setting for a date night and had a lovely ambiance about the place. We would recommend booking a table to avoid any disappointment as it was very busy and popular. We shared bone marrow to start which was fantastic and then had steak and duck confit for mains- both fantastic and perfectly cooked. It was honestly one of the best meals we have had since coming to Singapore and the waiting staff were very friendly and professional too. The restaurant offers a good selection of wine and came round with a complimentary freshly baked Madeline at the end of the meal too, which was a nice touch. Looking forward to our next visit already

Our early Valentine's night out and glad to find a good French brasserie. We arrived an hour early and were seated at the high table by the bar. It was a better choice given the very crowded seating in the back. We enjoyed the privacy for about an hour until a large group started to have drinks by the bar. Given the shortage of staff, we could see the owner had to roll his sleeves up to care of a full house. As such, service level dropped as we progress with our dinner. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the excellent food; and portions were rather generous. The cold cuts had a combination of various styles of pork and plenty for two. The oxtail was superb but very filling and heavy. We also tried the rump steak and loved the tender and sauces that matched well. No room for dessert. We ordered the wines by the glass but thought they could do better on the selection of reds. In any event, we would recommend but do make reservations.

Love this place...classy, great food, awesome wine list, top class service. Business dinner for 7 of us...started with bone marrow on toast, pork pate, cold cuts & pickles, aged goats cheese salad. Most of us has the steaks for mains...either the 21 day dry aged rumps or the rib-eye. The scallops looked really good to. Finished off with a round of Calvados Lovely meal again. Thanks to the Gavroche tea

We experienced only the best hospitality and service during our recent visit for the birthday of a family member. We were given a wonderful table and attentive service, especially appreciated when we had two small children with us. The food was beautifully prepared and prompt, we enjoyed excellent wine and shared amazing desserts between us. The atmosphere on a Saturday night was busy but still cosy and relaxed, with authentic dÃ©cor and tucked neatly away in a beautiful shop house in Tras Street. I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions and for excellent French brasserie food.

Had a lunch there. Very good lamb shoulder, but the potato gratin was more on the watery side than creamy side. I hesitated having a half bottle of Rollan de By Bordeaux, but it was priced at 75sgd (this half-bottle is sold EUR9 in retail in France- it is a usual winner in blind tests). The glass of the same wine (with a better vintage) is priced at 19sgd, so we opted for th glasses instead, wondering about the price policy here. Very fine profiteroles. A good experience, but wine pricing is on the high side
4
One of the finest french food - great duck confit , excellent appetisers served here. Service is very good - staff attentive. Variety of food is good.
5
When you need some culinary pampering on a Friday, you can't beat fresh moules mariniere and tender cote de boeuf, simple but extremely well cooked..
5
Visited 2nd time. This time with my in-laws. This is the first time they had French food. All 4 of us enjoyed the food greatly!
5
Super experience as usual. Not the first time going, definitely not the last. Brasserie Gavroche is providing great food, with an outstanding service.
4
Good ambience, food was awesome too. I tried the duck confit and its really good. The appetiziser we had (some crab dish) was so good too
5
Cuisine as you find it in an upper class French bistro in France. The service is very good and the restaurant atmosphere transports you to the center of Paris
4
Excellent service from our table waiter - Robin. Food was very good we had the snails, the foie gras, the special - Cote De Beouf and desert of pavlova. Also had a great bottle of St Emilion 2008. Bill of 400+ was reasonable given the high quality overall

With so many new and modern restaurants in Singapore, it is rather refreshing to revisit a traditional French brasserie in Brasserie Gavroche. They might have been a French no-signboard as one can walk past it unknowingly along the many shophouses along Tras Street in the Tanjong Pagar vicinity.The antique and beautiful powder blue doors opens to the classic French décor which provided the perfect segue to a wonderful traditional Parisian dinner. I reckon the best uniform for waiters is still the French’s white shirts, black waistcoat and long white apron.The menu is also as French as you can get, starting with terrines, escargots, oysters, onion soup and salad nicoise. The three of us shared an entrée of poultry terrine with a mustard sauce and rather interesting mache (a small leafy green) salad. For our main courses, we had steak frite with béarnaise, lamb shoulder confite and monkfish cheek with cream sauce of mushrooms and young potatoes respectively. We ordered a side of spinach to add greens to the meal. My daughter loves the French’s steak frite because of its perfect size but she reckoned Gavroche’s could have more “wok hei”. But the béarnaise sauce made up for it. Trust the French with sauces. So’s my sauce for the monkfish. Taste of France you might say. Some say monkfish is not tender for a fish and even tough. But then again, that’s why they call them the poor man’s lobster. And Gavroche’s memorable for me to return for.We completed dinner with a tarte tatin. Theirs is an upside-down version with the ample apples showing rather than the pastry. I like the natural sweetness of the apple and perfectly complemented with the vanilla ice cream. As I looked around the Brasserie that Saturday evening, I can’t help but noticed that there were mainly Caucasians and we and two other were the only Asians. Perhaps another testimony to the authenticity of the cuisine. The service was prompt and immaculate. They were noticeably shorthanded that day but everyone including the maître d chipped in and we were none the worse.Our dinner worked out to be about $100 a head including a glass of Cote du Rhone each. Not inexpensive for a meal but together with the charm of Gavroche it was worthwhile. I forgot to mention that they also have a bar as you walk in for your champagne before dinner or as you wait for your table.I can now count Gavroche as one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore
5
Consistently the go to place for a proper long-lunch with friends. A place that you immediate forget you are in Singapore, but instead somewhere in Paris. The service is professional, unhurried, and reflective of a top notch Paris brasserie.The food, simple, understated, unfussy, with fresh ingredients but very well executed.The ambience, laid back and not the first time one has spent 2.5 hour there, nor is it the last time.Chef Owner Frederic Colin keep it going
4
It is very French in a good way. I had the lemon sole for mains. They told us that the fish was bigger than normal and was $10 more expensive. Now I have been at this restaurant 5-6 times (yes it is that good) but they have said the same each an every time. Why not just price it like that in the menu? This time the fish was not fully cooked - slightly raw in the middle. The potatoes were a bit overcooked. My wife had the mussels - and they were a bit undercooked to my taste. The sauce was and bread was nice.
2
It’s the only one on the street and therefore usually busy. The drinks are all overpriced service is strictly ok and the food average. There are much better places close by so do explore and venture out
5
Everything was great from bread basket to desert. We had the oxtail, duck confit, and fish quentelles.
4
For an authentic French food, you can never go wrong at the Gavroche.
Fig is in season. We had figs salad with blue cheese. Pate de foie gras is a must when I have French food. Gavroche always serves very good fresh oysters from France.
4
Nice food and service is good too. The servers are very attentive. However there are 2 hours of limit for the table and they will served us the dessert menu when we are still eating our French fries.
5
Nothing to add to the title.prompt, accurate and efficient.
Ambience is truly brasserie and the quality and value consistent with Gavroche in Sydney.
4
Rump Steak is of good size and good value ($38), Poach Cod Fish and the scallop dish is equally good, Profiteroles Dessert is excellent.
4
This restaurant has great authentic French food! Service was good too. The duck confit didn't look refined but tasted delicious. The hanger steak was tender and well seasoned. Our lamb rump was excellently cooked. Our upside down apple tart was out of this world.Overall a wonderful dining experience
4
Very good menu and attentive service on arrival. Took some time however for a drinks order to be taken and again for the food order. A bit frustrating given they were not very busy. Food when it arrived was good, as was the dessert.Overall a pleasant night however for the cost we felt something was lacking.Nevertheless a pleasant experience dining in a themed restaurant in a shop house in downtown Singapore
4
A very cosy place with exquisitely prepared French food. I ordered trout while my friend ordered duck confit. In the end I preferred the duck confit! I will be back again to try on some other dishes. Side note: Well, I hope the staff can be more friendly.
2
My wife ordered Snails for a starter, when they arrived 3 of the 6 shells were empty, she advised the waitress who just took the plate away without saying anything, a few moments later she returned with the same plate and said "just eat the three and will bring three more" to which my wife refused, she returned 5 minutes later with 6 snails...3 hot for new preparation and 3 cold from the previous prep, no apologies or anything.....first time there has now turned into the last time there, super bad service and average food
5
Authentic setting, good music, very good service and the food was great. The menu is simple with enough choices.
They have a fine wine list so go for it, even by the glass.
4
Good food and service but slight on the expensive side for simple bistro food like escargot and duck confit.
5
Awesome food and atmosphere. Excellent attentive service. Highly recommend this place. Definitely will visit again.
5
Had a fantastic experience on the occasion of birthday. The hosts did a great job to make everything perfect
5
Great authentic brasserie that gives you the feel of being somewhere in France. Nice atmosphere in the restaurant with a generally well-dressed clientele, and comfortable layout with reasonable distance between tables. The service is good albeit a bit distant/business-like (except for the French maitre who is a bit more personable). The food is great, from the super fresh oysters to the great foie gras terrine, everything is excellent. The steak frites is also great: good quality meat and well-prepared (although there was some initial confusion between medium-rare vs medium-well which was swiftly resolved). The profiteroles were also good but my wife and I had to share this as the portions are quite sizeable so we had no space left for individual desserts...speaking of desserts, the choices on the menu all look so good that I wish they had a grand dessert option where you could get a small taste of everything...will definitely be back as this has quickly become one of my favourite spots to enjoy a steak and I am sure I will also give the sole meuniere, duck confit etc a try on a future visit
5
For dinner menu - Duck confit, lamb and beef steak were excellent. Very good value for money as price is reasonable. We paid about $85 per pax for 4 pax's consuming 4 main course, 4 starters/appetizers. Staff was friendly and warm. Very good service. We will definitely go back again.
5
We had a very nice dinner at Brasserie Gavroche.Service is very attentive and unhurried.We found the steak and seafood dishes a highlight - lovely presentation and beautifully prepared. The restaurant has an extensive wine list and we found some beautiful white wines that complimented our food choices.The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is well worth a visit for a great night out!Highly recommended
5
Just loved this place. You have a feeling you are truly in Paris with the decor, the menu and the French accents of the waiters. The "os a Moelle" appetizer is to die for. Then the duck Parmentier is my favorite dish. Great wine selection as well. We will come back.
4
Came here to celebrate my daughter's birthday with her godmother. The cold cuts platter was outstanding! My daughter's rump steak was better than my ribeye. I also enjoyed the homemade Earl Grey Ice Cream and Peach Sorbet. Gavroche gave us free orange madeleines after our meal. Restaurant is quite accessible, about 10 minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar station.
4
Very cute and intimate French restaurant. The moment you step in, you forget that you are in the middle of Singapore. The restaurant arranged some tables in the middle, which I'm not sure how it feels in terms of privacy. We got a table on the side which is just perfect. The menu is good, easy to navigate with all the classics. The salmon tartar had too much avocado and not very well balanced in my opinion, the foie gras tartine didn't come with enough bread which comes as a waste since the foie piece is quite big. Quail was great. Be aware that the floor can be slippery! Overall I'd definitely be back here again, great atmosphere and decent food. This is a good place to take 1,2 intimate friends or your first dates.
4
We had a great time at Brasserie Gavroche were we pent 2 hours drinking home made sangria and rose wine. We also shared charcuterie and cheese plates, what a pleasure to savour it ! Well decorated place and good service also.
5
Authentic French brasserie with great traditional food and attentive service. Nice casual ambience, good menu and excellent wine list.
5
I really like the decoration and the atmosphere. The waiters were polite and helpful. The food was really good. I tried the special Pea soup and tartare. I recommend.
3
Business lunch a Friday. Visually nice environment but smell of mold at entrance. Fabulous old wooden bar. Friendly waiter. Supposedly French food. I ordered veal rump medium rare and my colleague order boef tartare. In came something looking like fried ham slices on top of a nicely tasting hash browns. Unconvinced about whether or not meat was veal. Okish dish. My colleague witnessed he has been there many times and like their food. The boef tartare looked like raw meat mixed with some sauce or perhaps with egg yolk and looked kind of gooey. I personally prefer when you see the beautifully grounded meat and add the condiments by oneself. Anyway - probably good for business lunches but nothing I saw convinced this restaurant is worth a detour. The moldy smell at the entrance needs investigating and remedy
4
Great place for dinner. Lots of delicious food to choose from (pity the egg with split peas is not on the menu anymore), great wines by the glass or bottle, and good service. It can be noisy when it's busy but I think it's part of the ambience and they are good at pre-warning you if you're next to a big group
4
Service and food were great! I brought my friend for his birthday dinner and wrote in the note to request for a good seat. We were not only given a good seat, my friend was presented with birthday madeleines and a instant photo souvenir. Thank you for the great experience!

Went to restaurant for nice french food but experience was not great. (1) Booking come in 3 seatings with specific hours you can stay in restaurant, for example booking for 630pm needs to leave by 830pm. (2) Did a booking for 730pm and arrived early for pre-dinner drinks. Can't do it in the restaurant and also the bar opposite (belonging to same restaurant) are not connected. (3) Requested for corner table but was provided a table right in the middle of busy restaurant. (4) Restaurant seems short of staff and they tried to serve but they are apparently really busy. (5) We ordered a bottle of wine, the service staff arrived with the wine and then disappeared for 15 minutes. It is unusual as we expected the bottle to be opened for tasting and then poured for consumption. We thought the restaurant was having the wine poured into a decanter but it did not happened.
5
Unassuming restaurant front adds to the charm of the entire dining experience. I felt I was in a different time and place. Beyond the good food, everything else was so well considered! Great ambience from the lighting, music selection etc. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there and would definitely return. So glad to have been able to introduce the restaurant to my husband and friends
5
Once you enter the restaurant, you are transported to a bistro somewhere in France. The decor, furnishings and menu are authentic. Starting with a white Burgundy to accompany my first course of escargots was the perfect pairing and continued thru my main course of a beautifully prepared filet of sole meuniÃ¨re. Passed on a delightful dessert offering to close on an expresso, which was the perfect finish. If you are in Singapore and searching for a fine French meal, this is the place
5
The brasserie experience couldn't be more authentic and both the settings, outside (Tras Street) and inside complete the picture. Food is high quality, plenty and super value for money. Wines are fairly priced and the 'chef-de" always has a great off the list recommendation. Cold cuts, tartare, french fries (the real ones), spinach: divin
5
Love the Ambience of this bistro...very chill out experience and one of our favourite hang-out! We love the steak and salmon tartare :) yum yum
4
Very pretty interior, warm & cosy place... Great place for friends to catch up.. French tunes added much more ambience to the beautiful place.
5
the real food of french brasserie, fine and tasty, well cooked, friendly service.. great wines!! enjoy this restaurant and his atmosphere!
5
My favourite place to have a business lunch or dinner! Service was great and prompt. Food was perfect.
5
Good to see that nothing's changed since December and Gavroche continues to please! Being a regular its nice to try new things, and never disappointed!
5
There is an air well in the building that provide natural sun light. Love it.
Food is fair. Good service. Even debone my fish for me
4
Having visited Paris last month we are in love with the French Bistro, the concept is simple, basic wholesome food that is not expensive but it's tasty. Nothing fancy but good ingredients and the great thing is it's good value, lunch for two was about $75 no alcohol, decent size portions, can't wait to go back and hoping the restaurant is as good as the Brasserie, that will be my next outing
4
Food is good, reasonable price, great atmosphere. There are two reasons why it doesn't deserve 5 stars 1) NO BUTTER KNIFE. This was the same feedback I gave 1 yrs ago and nothing has changed. This is a french restaurant that serves bread and butter, but no butter knife. Instead of the waiters ask me to use our main dish knife????? wtf is this.. a restaurant like this surely isnt difficult to get butter knife ??? I have never been to a proper restaurant that serves butter and bread but no butter knife?? Completely unacceptable. 2) I respect that each waiter manages their own tables. However waiters should be helping out each other when things get busy. One particular young french waiter refuses to help our table with small things eg. getting the bill or asking for a spare plate. These two issues really need to be addressed
2
Invited my friends from Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Shenzhen for a pre b-dinner. Had to wait 30min for our table.Great bistro setting.Generous meny with many french traditional dishes.We had, onion soup, fois gras, oysters, salmon tartar, all excellent except for the soup. Lamb, steak, duck confit, fish quenelles, poussin. The poussin was frozen, then sous vide and the coloured when ordered!! Not ok. The texture is like raw, not nice. Why? Served with some horrible corn mash. The quenelles had egg yolks instead of cream, that made them like poached scrambled eggs. With several seating in one night there are never too many guests at one time. 7very young people in the kitchen, no one french. When we addressed the chef/owner he was very defensive and not apologetic at all. He blamed the huge amounts of guests, 60over a whole evening! As a chef myself, educated and trained in France, I dare to comment on french food. That was not appreciated that we catch them cut corner and not stick to french quality.
4
The food was very solid and the wine list was good, but the place had a few weak spots like service (we had to keep waving down waiters like overly eager school children), attention to detail (come on, would it hurt you to bring two more slices of bread for the main course sized beef tartare?) and, to my husband's horror (I'm not kidding, he wouldn't shut up about it) the espresso machine is a Nespresso machine. Like, they don't make your coffee by grinding beans - they make it from a pod. So, overall, our experience was fine, but I doubt we'll be back. Lots of other French places to try! P.S. Ladies, feel free to bring a shawl or sweater, it gets chilly inside!
4
Nice French food, good ambience. Price wise, same as other French restaurants. Dessert is good. Customer service good.
3
Food was well prepared, nicely presented and good portion. It was good but lack the WOW. Service was good. Parisian chic ambient. Pleasant meal.
2
2 mains, one dessert and one glass of wine for 150 SGD. The quality of the food is standard French brasserie but the price if of a 1* Michelin restaurant.
4
A very nice and cosy French restaurant. The food is superb yet the price will not burn a hole in the pocket. Really love the ambience and it all started even before we step into the restaurant.
5
Our family had dinner there. It was recommended by my French colleagues. The steaks were excellent and reasonable priced. The price of the wine is a bit stiff but it's still ok. We will definitely dine there again! Service is good and attentive.
5
My regular - at least once or twice a month. Consistently good quality of food and service . Never tire of Salmon tartare and the Steak Tartare! And the Madeleines to finish.....
3
My friend and I was slightly disappointed at our recent experience at Brasserie Gavroche. It wasn't the first time I had been there and I feel that the standard has dropped. We ordered an appetizer to share - it was on the specials menu: sunny side up eggs with truffle; and two mains - the rump steak with fries and the seabass. The meal started out well with the special appetizer, the truffle was amazing (and I'm not crazy about truffle). While this was good though, it cost $48++, quite expensive. The mains were very disappointing: - the black peppercorn sauce drowned the steak and it wasn't medium rare enough for me, the fries were soggy and when we mentioned this to them, they replaced it with over-fried fries (too hard this time.. not crispy). The seabass wasn't fresh and we made the mistake of not saying so at the outset. We went somewhere else for dessert
4
There's a very relaxed vibe,with excellent service.Extensive wine list. Wide but not terribly deep. We had a Chablis and Gigondas,but were told we'd had the last bottle of each.The rib eye steak frites were really good,the pork loin on red cabbage didn't really work. Not sure why,I think it was the way the pork had been cooked and the fat was not pleasant. I know,we Brits should complain more !. Onion soup was again authentic,and there nothing more French than the escargots we had.All in all,it was a memorable evening and we would certainly returnPre dinner drinks in the Gavroche bar across the road was good fu
5
We are lucky to live nearby and visit it once or twice a month. Great food, excellent reliable service. Good choice in the menu both meat and seafood.My recommendation - go for mussels and oysters, really delicious.But any choice from the menu will satisfy you. Busy, better to pre-book. Don't mix it up with cafe Gavroche across the street. They are connected, but another one is more simple and the menu differs
4
Beautifully decorated restaurant that transports you to Paris. We ordered 3 appetizers for sharing - escargot, foie gras and bone marrow. The escargot and foie gras were great, however, the bone marrow was a little too rich for most of us. Ordered Steak Frites for main and it tasted perfect! I was slightly disappointed with Crepe, it tasted quite bitter, more than I'd prefer. the profiteroles were much better! Good wine selection too.Overall, the food and service were fantastic! Highly recommended!
4
Seems popular for non-chinese as we were the only Chinese diners on Sat night. Excellent and attentive service but menu price on the high side. Would be great if pricing is more friendly for regular visit.
4
It was a nice place for small gathering and was accessible approximately 5mins from train station. The toilet was pretty though is a little small.
5
Service was good, steak was great (medium rare was better than medium, we both had the steak and I made the mistake of ordering the medium), the french onion soup was great but could have used more cheese and bread.
5
Been here loads of time. Always coming back because their service is always good and food is on point each and every time. Try the sole, trust me.

We had booked this as a special restaurant for dinner and were really looking forward to a special night. Unfortunately the night was spoilt by overly attentive staff who removed plates while we were still eating and rushed us through the whole night. We sat down and were given menus immediately and within two minutes they wanted to take our order. The staff were pacing up and down the restaurant constantly looking for things to do and were obviously over staffed. I like good service but this was over the top and felt very intrusive. The meal was very ordinary too which made it worse as it is not cheap. I had the duck confit with mashed potato, which actually tuned out to be a duck 'shepherds pie' and was very boring. My husband had the lamb with mashed potato. It was very chewy and fatty on the outside but tender in the middle. There was absolutely no decoration, not even a green leaf to break the plainness of the meals. As soon as we had finished our main (and still chewing) the plates were whisked away and a dessert menu placed in front of us. Five minutes later we were asked for our desert orders. At that point we couldn't wait to get out of there
4
First impressions of this place are great - you step into a little part of Paris, or as near as it's possible to get in Singapore - decor, French waiters, furniture, pictures, every cliche nicely in place and not overly done. The menu is perfect - bone marrow, escargots, foie gras, warm goats cheese salad, hanger steak - all my favourite bistro classics - if I have a complaint with the menu, it's that the wine list is a little over priced and there isn't enough choice in the sub SGD100 bracket, but then this is Singapore after all…. Service was friendly and reasonably quick, particularly considering this was a packed Friday night - the one wrinkle was when a junior member of staff came and told us our 2 hours was up and we had to move to the bar, despite the fact that this was the first time we had been told of a time limit and the fact that my wife had made it clear that this was a birthday celebration - problem was quickly remedied when the senior waiter came up and smoothed things over and to be honest we took it in our stride - you can't get 100% faultless staff in Singapore with the hiring restrictions in place but this place gets pretty close and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a French food fix, just bring the cheque book…
5
Very good Brasserie in a quaint storefront in Tanjong Pagar section of Singapore. Service was great and our meals were so much better than a French place we frequently visit in NYC. Rib eye was very tender and the lamb shank was equally good. Both were cooked to perfection. We recommend Gavroche for dinner. They also have a cafe across the street for lighter options and lunch.
4
We tried out this restaurant in the hope of adding a bistro/brasserie to our favourite eating places in Singapore. It's tucked away in a popular locale behind an interesting old door that opens into a safely conventionally set out restaurant. Bar in front of main restaurant. French, relaxed &unstuffy, ambience. Staff and service ranged from slightly surly to excellent - luckily the chap who took care of us was the latter. attentive,helpful advice, non-intrusive as opposed to a couple of female waiters with scowls We ordered steak frites and a salted cod brandade (fish and mash pie) for mains with escargot, onion soup and grilled Mediterranean prawns for starters. I got the impression that the prawns would be accessories on a bowl of salad so chose to check out the traditional soup. I regretted not going with prawns but the soup was all it should be. Daughter loved the escargots Do bring your reading glasses, as the menu is more decorative than functional. COD brandade made me feel like I was being taken care of as house guest of the French family - balanced, mash texture nicely offset with crispy crust. steaks were good medium rare - like any good restaurant in this range. The frites portions are big. Pip got to doggy bag hers for later. The wine list was ok. No BYO but if you buy one, you can open one of your own. In Singapore where many people have collect excellent wines relative to restaurant lists, I think the restaurant should consider corkage that matches their average margins. We ended with a Gevray Chambertin, relatively young 2010 for around $150. Ok given list was not Long. We ended sharing a Mille Feuille for desserts and it was just delicious. 2 seatings in this restaurant and 830 scowls came round to ask if we wanted our bill. which was around $500 for the 3 of us including the vino. Wife and Daughter loved the place. scowls put me off a little. if our usual is full, yes, I'd come back and hope the nice chap serves our table. and obviously it's not affiliated to the London namesake.
4
It has been sometime back since we visited this Restn. Had dinner last nite. Every single dish is still very well done! They wouldn't fail us. Love the little gougeres (French cheese puffs), a little nice touch to start off before your meal. Salad Nicoise is heavenly! For mains, we had lamb rump & lemon sole, very well done & love it! A nice touch that they offer to debone the lemon sole. Hard to find a Restn which can maintain their quality after so many years into operations. They had done well
5
Arrived around 6:30pm with no reservation, maître d was very accommodating and extremely welcoming.This is a fantastic place to visit, great for casual business and private gatherings. I expect it would be very good for a romantic date as well.The service is exceptional, not often found here. Went with the maître d's recommendation of a 500g sirloin to share, along with starters and a crepe for dessert. Overall it was a great experience, quiet enough to have a pleasant conversation without shouting
4
Brasserie Gavroche provides a lively sometimes noisy presentation of good simple French cooking. A little on the expensive side but what is not in Singapore.
5
This is a place that never failed to deliver. Salmon tartare is a must for me. Don't forget their Tartine d’os à moëlle .... Impressive wine list for Singapore. Their côte de bœuf always satisfy my need for good meat in Singapore.
5
Service was attentive, food excellent. This was a return visit as I will be back again. Only negative was that we were squished on to a small table for three when it was really only suitable for two.
4
the steak and bone marrow were just awesome. reasonable prices for an authentic French restaurant.
would love to be back!
5
It felt like being back home, in Paris, with the added bonus of friendly and attentive service. I will definitely be back for more real French brasserie cuisine.
5
Excellent food beautifully prepared. Wines were too expensive. Some mid range wines should be included. Service was good but could be more friendly
5
This is a French style Brasserie service most of the favourites; roasted marrow on toast, onion soup, steak frites, crepes suzette etc. Always a reliable choice when I am in Singapore. Excellent service, well prepared food, good cheese selection, decent wine wine list. Nice bright ambience at lunch time, cosy at night.Always a pleasure dning here

It's a real french brasserie and the quality of food is stunning. Quality of products, quality of cuisine, freshness, service, etc. Everything is perfect. Only minus : even if very nice list, Wines were too expensive. 100% recommended PS : the homemade foie gras is 10/10 and the beef is AMAZING (french quality). Congrats for the sourcing

Despite half of Singapore seemingly missing, we visited Brasserie Gavroche and had a superb evening. Service was excellent even though the restaurant was very quiet, and the waiters and staff engaged with us at our table. Food was of very high quality and the Bordeaux wine by the glass was a great accompaniment. Hopefully the quiet night was just a blip, as this is a place well worth visiting
2
The decor and style are very much run-of-the-mill brasserie and the food options are hit or miss.But the service was downright basic - considering this is a place that charges more than a $100 for a bottle of everyday table wine, the expectation is that the waiter will advise the availability of dishes - and not come back 5 minutes later saying to my wife that she is "unlucky because the last ox tail was just sold"- in this regard, the customer service is authentically French.This farcical number happened *twice more* and is reminiscent of "Fawlty Towers" not Singapore in 2016.I would not recommend this place
5
Not the first time there and we've never disappointed! Good food, good wine, impeccable service! Recommended!
5
One of the most authentic French restaurants in Singapore. Not one dish didn't meet expectations. Delicious !
5
Love this restaurant!! All food is fantastic and bread is really good too! Highly recommend French Resturant in SG!
5
Really lovely service. Ambience is very pleasant. Food is so well presented, different and delicious! The wine list is great - but even the house wines are very pleasing and good value.
1
Restaurant was very crowded and noisy, not ideal for talking.
Service was poor and food took very long to serve.
4
Friendly staff, food quality as expected, professional service, good wine list. Desserts possibly the only letdown.
3
Appetizers were presented well, however the main courses left a lot to be desired in presentation and taste. The sole in lemon butter looked very dead and came without any decoration on the plate. Although being mentioned that this is a birthday dinner, no congratulations or cake option was offered. When we asked to use our own small cake, we were told in a stern voice that no outside food was allowed. Disappointing experience - We will not have any celebrations at this place in the future.
5
My friend and I love french food and we loved the food at Brasserie Gavroche! We had the foie gras, goat cheese salad and duck confit with grated potatoes. Everything was delicious! We thoroughly had a really good time there and the service was good too! I would definitely be back!
5
Second run out to this French restaurant. Very high standard and a good choice on the menu. The oysters are served with traditional shallot/ red vinegar and makes the French experience. The meat is cooked to perfection. A great place for that special occasion, but like Singapore, perhaps not cheap. A magnum of champagne is a good selection for that special evening
5
Introduced by French friend to this restaurant. Been there twice since.I like the ambience, the food, and the wine.Food prices is reasonable, though slightly more expensive. But for the quality, I am ok.Wine is, well, you just can't get reasonably priced French wine in Singapore. Right? Trick is, I go by the glass from the house pour. I drank mostly champagne anyway
5
The entrance of the restaurant is easy to miss, but once you step into the restaurant, you get a feeling that you have been transported into a brasserie in France. Loved the food and the service. They had an excellent wine list too.
5
Thoroughly good French bistro and good value for money. Only regret is we hadn't found it sooner, it will become a regular
5
Great food, decent service, good advice on the menu and wine list as well as a very charming location. Number 1 choice for a small-party lunch any day.
5
We came over here on St Valentines and it was packed. The food and decor were classy and it was an enjoyable evening. Will certainly return....
4
Typical French bistro atmosphere. Very friendly service. Good menu and wine list. Fairly expensive ($350+ for 2 people with one bottle of wine).
4
We felt like having dinner at a French bistro and we were told Brasserie Gavroche was good so we booked in and left fulfilled.We kicked off with the duck liver pate and this was soft and tasted incredible,we followed this up with the salmon tartare with horseradish and lemon - a great dish !the next dish was an omelette which was unusual but nevertheless a winner.we washed all of this down with the cheapest bottle of Malbec on the menu and the bill still came to $200.well worth a visit
5
Banquette seating! Fantastic. Asia just doesn't get good seating but here we have it. Good wine list and some fantastic food. French waitress was good but local waitress insisted on trying to balance our table whilst we were dining...how would anyone think that's the right time to try that? Like the place and will return
4
We come here often, perhaps twice a month. It's a hit with our family and friends.So we call for a table for 5 pax early evening, then add another 2 more persons as we ask our family members if they would like to join in. And at 5:30 pm, we call to add another 2 seats. Could you do it, yes or no, I asked. I have worked in restaurants before and I know sometimes demanding customers are unpleasant. I simply asked - can you accommodate 2 more.Imagine being told in that unpleasant imperious pissed off French manner "Oh now I have to re-arrange the whole restaurant (!) and it is half hour before opening."This place is not cheap, it is considered good dining but I'm afraid they lack the manners and grace to be consistently pleasant to their regular customers!They should hire Filipinos rather than Frenchmen
4
Was greeted by very warm server. Very good service and great food. Love the complimentary cheese ball and the bread! Love the French onion soup as well. Server is super attentive because my gf dropped her phone and this female server hurrily rush over to pick up her phone. Recommended place to go.
2
Non-French speaking staff cannot even read or pronounce the French menu properly.The onion soup did not have the authentic taste as the menu claims.The cod was salty and did not taste fresh.Waiter only tops up once our glasses with sparkling water. Not value for money at all!
4
Wonderful environment to dine at. Dessert was superb.
The serving time could be faster if possible as I need to wait around 15mins to be seated down, and another 15-20mins to have the main dishes served.
5
A wonderful restaurant to spend an evening with friends. An interesting and varied menu with some great specials all presented and explained by the good staff and even the chef himself. I can recommend the bone marrow and the quenelles. Definitely going back.
4
visited on Xmas Day. Not very busy. Service very good. Typical Parisian restaurant with good quality food and large portions. A little expensive but overall a very enjoyable experience.
3
Expect very friendly and helpful staff, however the food was slightly disappointing. Rib eye steak came slightly tough despite ordering it medium well. Atlantic cod was very fresh though.
5
We had a wonderful experience at the restaurant. The service was superb and the food was delicious. We will definitely visit again!
5
Nice place with a truly French atmosphere. Only one of the waiters didn't speak French. We had typical brasserie food, which was well prepared. The escargots could have done with a bit more butter, but that's personal taste. The bearnaise sauce was very good and the fries were the best we've tasted in Singapore so far. Loved the French veggies: epinards with some garlic. Bery tasty! Good wine, although a couple more affordable bottles on the list would have been nice.
5
Found this restaurant recommendation on one of the food blog and wanted to give it a try. After much researching especially from the reviews given on hungrygowhere, I was slightly apprenhensive with the 50% score. Right after stepping into the restaurant, I have to say all doubts were immediately blown away. The service from the start to end was top-notch, and honestly one of the best service I have yet received in Singapore. The service staff were attentive yet not intrusive, was prompt yet not forceful. I honestly do not understand all the negative response that was given previously. The whole atmosphere was in line with what I expected of dining in a French restaurant - laidback coupled with its exquisite dishes. The main course we ordered (pardon me I have limited knowledge in french cuisine) Welsh Lamb Rump was done to perfection and while the Hand-cut Beef Tartare was slightly salty, this could be down to personal preference. I would definitely recommend Brasserie Gavroche if you're looking for a exclusive, romantic & classy restaurant to bring your date to 
5
You Will enter in Paris With brasserie Gavroche , From The door to furniture , it's a beautyfull set up , food are in generous portion and pretty good , wine selection is proper to We ad wonderful time there and will be back on our next trip to Singapore
5
I follow them since the opening almost 5 years ago. The quality of the food is amazing. The choice is ample and the receipes are coming from the chef's Frederic Colin grandfather.Overtime the stability of quality is achieved thanks to the presence of the chef in the kitchen every day. Good level of service. Not the cheapest but one of the very best in Singapore
4
Tasty and excellent! The Organic poached eggs with red wine sauce and bacon was to die for. My friends and I shared the braised oxtail and pork hotpot and they were both very good. The meat was tender and falls off the bones and the the sauces were wonderful with the bread. Place was crowded and noisy. We had to talk loudly but it adds to the atmosphere. Overall good experience
5
Brasserie Gavroche is cooking delicious authentic French Brasserie cuisine, service is top level, great selection of wines, ambience and vibe like in the heart of Paris.
Great place for Lunch, Dinner, Business or a great night out with Friends.
4
Good food - well served - always have a pleasant experience. Brasserie Gavroche continues to maintain high standards. Café Gavroche across the road is also one of my favourites - great bar - and again really nice bar staff. Vive La France!!
5
Rustic french bistro feel, food is fantastic, really good service, really good vibe. definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore.
5
Love this place. The service and food are delightful. Highly recommended to make a good first impression or catch up with old friends.

Celebrated our wedding anniversary here with a weekday lunch. We had:
- Escargot
- Terrine de Foie Gras
- Quail
- Rabbit
- Macaron
- Cheese Mousse

Food was splendid, coupled with wine. Me and partner had beef dishes and they were executed to perfection.

We had dinner as two couples, going with high expectations after all the reviews. There were many pros, but two big cons (the second of which was the deal breaker and the reason for the title of this review). Pros: charming decor, old shophouse, French ambience, quaint feeling, decent food that enough reviewers have written about. Cons: (1) The waiter told us about the two specials of the day, both appetizers. When we were ready to order, he came and said, "Escargots and ...?" We replied, "No escargots, just the potato skins and crab gratin please." Next thing we knew, the escargot tongs and forks had been placed on the table. We told a waitress that we hadn't ordered the escargots. She called the waiter, and we told him the same thing. He said, "I know." The waitress cleared away the escargot tongs and forks. We got the rest of the appetizers, then the waiter appeared again and asked, "Do you want the escargots?" We said if they were free of charge we'd take them, otherwise we hadn't ordered them so didn't want them. He said "No" and left. We found his behavior with the escargots rather strange. (2) One of the people in our party ordered the lemon sole, which was listed on the menu for $42. He received a large piece of sole, a slice of lemon, and two boiled potatoes (very different from pictures on the Internet of the same dish), which he found tasty enough but boring and monotonous bite after bite. We had the restaurant split the bill in two, signed it, and left. After getting home, we checked our bill. We had been charged half for all the dishes, as expected, but $31 for the sole. We called the restaurant and said there must have been a mistake because the sole was $42, not $62. The person at the other end said, "It was a very big sole. The waiter must have told you it was one of the specials, and the price is $62." We told him we had specifically pointed to the $42 sole on the menu, the waiter had only told us about two specials that were both appetizers, and that if we had known it was such a "big sole" for which he was going to charge $62 we certainly would not have ordered it. We were subjected to a high-handed lecture along the lines of "The market has different sizes of fish every day. We can't control that. Today the fish was very big." My advice: before you eat what you are served at Brasserie Gavroche, double-check that it is indeed what you ordered ($), and before you sign the bill take a careful look at it
5
I go there at least once a month! Always opt for the Tartare (salmon or steak!) - Always excellent, whatever I choose - French of course - what would you expect. Can be busy so need to book. Same menu for lunch and dinner - charming shop house
4
Went on a weekday night and place was crowded. Service was good. Food was good. Wine list was exhaustive but I'm not a wine connoisseur. As long it's nice, I'm happy. Overall a good place for dinner but crowd was noisy. Not sure it's a good place for romantic dinner. And good looking servers they hav
5
I went to this restaurant being the nearest french restaurant that serves steak tartare. I had a bad craving for this. This was over marinated, the tomato paste and horseradish stood out, masking the taste of the fresh beef. The fries that came with the dish was crisp on the outside and soft in the inside.I had a warm goat cheese salad, which was served on a bed of salad and bread toast. The salad was tangy, i think the manager mentioned onion dressing. It was great. It complemented well with the heavy cheese. The goat cheese was on top of the camembert chees and melted. Overall taste was good, i liked this but i think i put on 10kg
4
Pork and duck liver starter is great. Duck main course is just fine, but lamb is good. We ordered light wine, for me it's a bit too sour while not so flavory.
5
Classic recipes executed well. Also possibly the best rabbit I've ever had. Outstanding and well worth a visit. We'll be going back.
5
Really good food and atmosphere! We had a lamb steak and a beef steak. Very tender and delicious! Service was very good too!
5
Great classic (and not so classic) French fare... Keeps getting better each year with some additions off the menu from time to time
5
Loved this place. Very authentic French cuisine. Highly recommended. Always enjoyed the friendly service.
5
It has been a long time since I walked out a business lunch feeling: that was perfectly traditional and old school. By luck it was the client's favourite place and so double bonus!It was how shipping business was done in London, Paris, Hamburg back in the old days, and certainly Brasserie Gavroche provided the atmosphere and experience as well as the excellent food to go with it.Very French and refreshingly so given the modern settings for lunches these days.Long may it continue
5
Careful you may miss out the entrance to this lovely restaurant. The senior staff was awesome and very helpful... The junior staff can be quite blur but overall we are happy with the service and attentiveness of the staff...Food is superb and tasty! Must try the salmon tartare, it was awesomelyyummy! The ambience wasperfect for gathering or chatting. It was auite criwded eventhough it was a weekday, so reservation is encouraged...
5
This place is warm & cozy. It could be rather noisy as it's always full house. I love their fresh oyster. It's creamy, plumb, sweet & of course fresh. I love the steak too. Always perfectly cooked. Charred outside, soft & tender inside. Not bloody at all. This is also the place where I would order fish. Normally I don't eat fish in a Western restaurant. I'm sorry to say that Western restaurants could not handle fish as good as Chinese restaurants but this one is really good. really go
4
It was a celebratory occasion - our Anniversary. Our son took us to this fancy place, a corner of Paris in a happening part of Singapore. We were not disappointed. The food was great, service good, could have been more energetic, but in a happy mood we took it with a smile. We were happy with warm appetizers, salads and fish for mains. Our son went for the roasted Welsh lamb rump to splurge. Don't ask what we had for desserts. All FUN
3
Tables were squeezed so close to each other that i was worried that my bum would end up in the neighbouring table's soup bowl. This happened when i was led to my seat at the start of my dinner that saw me having to do an awkward manoeuvre in order to get to my seat between two other tables... and i am a US size 4. Food was good but comfort level was really poor for this price range
3
Food was good. Service needs some work - e.g. water was never topped up at any point during the meal. Nobody came to ask if the food was okay once we had been given our main courses or asked how any of the courses were.
4
Went to Brasserie Gavroche for mum's birthday dinner, the ambience was very cozy felt like we were back in Paris! The food was great not to forget the Chef's delicious signature Madelines. Overall a very pleasant experience, Will definitely go again.
4
I thoroughly enjoyed my fish with ratatouille complemented by a glass of champagne. The staff are attentive and it is nice that you can hear your lunch companion!
5
never upsets me! brought some workmates to experience it this time and they loved it! fantastic warm team to complement!

as a bunch of practising students of the french language, we have harboured the thought of eating authentic french cuisine for some time now. finally as fate would have it we arrived at brasserie gavroche almost by chance (don't book the wrong restaurant—there's a REALLY noisy bar and the much more ambient restaurant opposite each other)... and the food was très delicieux to say the least. our maître d' was lovely too—he actually took time to entertain our poor french and even correct us when we used more inappropriate verbs. (:overall, a very enjoyable experience.for starters, we had tomato salad and onion soup. the onion soup was slightly underwhelming, but the tomato salad was definitely a great way to start the meal.for mains, we had quail, pork stew and fish in crayfish sauce, all of which absolutely delighted us. the quail was done to perfection, but too tough, but what really stole the limelight in this dish is the corn purée—lovely layering of flavours and a delight in every mouth. the pork stew reminded us of home and one of us instantly wished for rice (à la chinese style) to go with it. we especially liked how the pork was still so tender and juicy despite being stewed for many long hours. the fish was an interesting concoction of flavours—definitely on the rich side, but we enjoyed it all the same. don't expect a slab of fish... this was fish purée mixed with some other ingredients but strangely enough it was not at all underwhelming but a great blend of savoury and creamy in every bite.the desserts were tout parfaît! we had crêpes, tarte tatin and marquise au chocolat. and not to mention, complimentary madeleines. the desserts were the best. we're not going to give it away, but trust us, you got to have desserts when you dine at brasserie gavroche... their food is definitely not gavroche.a very lovely meal. (
4
I continue to be dissapointed by the service industry in Singaporem . However Brasserie Gavroche impressed me. Right from entry, the cater during the ordering and meal until we left. We done. Good simple and superb food delivered efficiently. Was quite busy for a weekday lunch. Keep it up
4
I do not think I can count the number of times I have gone to this restaurant. Weather it is with friends, or clients it does not disappoint. The service is top notch and are very helpful choosing a good wine to go with the meal. Their steak in my opinion is the best value in Singapore. The place has a great vibe, but it is small and the tables are close together which in my opinion adds to the ambiance. I believe it will be one of the first restaurants I go to when I am back in Singapor
5
We had booked a table for 7.30, unfortunately NDP rehearsal meant we were stuck in traffic. A telephone call to the restaurant to let them know we would be late. We turned up a full hour late, our table was still reserved for us, thank you brasserie gavroche.As ever, the food was delicious, service fantastic. Our starter choices: onion soup, deep flavoured stock, bone marrow on toast, very creamy and melt in the mouth, warm goats cheese salad, very subtle nutty taste.Main courses: has to be steak and frites in a French restaurant! My friends were praising the quality of the steak. I chose the quail, very moist and succulent. My husband had grandpa Henri's pork hot pot. A huge pot of very tender pork and vegetables, well done grandpa Henri!I was too full for dessert, but my friends opted for the profiteroles, they weren't disappointed.Service was great, we will be back. Brasserie Gavroche you never disappoint us.
2
Great food, great atmosphere, no doubt about it. The steak was perfectly cooked. However we were over-charged by two coffees ( @ $12!) and only noticed after we left. They explained there's nothing they could do over the phone and basically if I want my money I had to go back on that exact day and collect my money which was OWED to me
5
We had read the menu before we arrived and it contained some of the dishes we had tried in France and we were keen to see how Gavroche would compare. It compares extremely well indeed. We were looked after by a totally professional group of staff who advised on and served us a fabulous meal. The menu covers a great range of classics (broader than we found in France) and all the dishes were just completely authentic and would not be out of place anywhere in France.We enjoyed great service and very good food in a very French style
4
The food is really great, the service is great but the ambiance could be better. It lacks a bit of warmth and originality.
4
Great rustic menu, honest French food delivered with aplomb. Service was efficient and attentive, but could have been friendlier
4
One of my favourite French restaurants. Love the steak and fries :) good wine list and wait staff is knowledgable
5
I have been dinning at Brasserie Gavroche for 2 years and always received excellent services and food.
4
French restaurant with nice decoration and two different atmospheres and a nice bar to have a drink while waiting to be seated.
3
Heard great reviews on the food but was disappointed that it was only mediocre. Pricy but portions are big. Somehow the food lacks oomph. Definitely tried better French food. I wouldn't go back again to pay that price.
4
We walked in and the atmosphere was great, lots happening and the restaurant is very well decorated. Food was good but not great, and for the price there is a lot of choice for French restaurants in Singapore. Pate to start? So-so. Steak Tartar? 2 of 3 were very good. Cod with mashed potatoes? Not good. Profiteroles? Very good.I cannot say it was a memorable meal, it was a good meal. For the prices you are paying for dinner here, the French restaurant Bistro Sommelier blows this place away
4
Brasserie Gavroche has a discreet location behind some narrow wooden doors in the shop houses of Tras Street just off the bustle of Tanjong Pagar. Coupon parking on the street is available outside the front door. The service is very European with very smart and and very French looking waiters working amid the dark wood fittings. There's a selection of excellent wines and a small bar. The skylight provides natural light and an airy feeling.The steak and chips are excellent, as is the walnut and goat's cheese salad. I commend this restaurant to anyone pining for a piece of France in Singapor
5
There is a lot of competition for fine dining in Singapore, particularly French cuisine. In my view, this restaurant is one of the best. The food features many French classics, interspersed with fresher recipes, with change from time to time. My colleague had the onion soup, which he said was the best he had eaten outside of France. The rest of us had a selection of meat and salad dishes, all of which were excellent. My friend paid for the wine, as he can afford to have a taste for Pomerol. I can only say it was wonderful and closed my eyes to the bill at that point!Nice to see French staff in attendance and taking charge
5
This place was recommended to me by some friends and I was not disappointed. It's a small intimate place, the staff are efficient and friendly. The food was great, the steak tartar was tasty, portion size is good, not scary big or too small either. The warm goats cheese salad was yummy and a good size. I am going back there again and I'm looking forward to it. The menu isn't extensive and what they do, they do well. This has definitely become a wee gem to visit and I'm excited to go back. Also it had a great and extensive wine list, what more can you ask for.
5
Nice cozy place with outside seating ( Drinks) and balcony (Optional) for a romantic or chat with friends evening. nice food but may be they should remember Sicilians have large appetite ( ha ha) over all great experience
5
Excellent steak tar tar, wonderful salads, some unique menu items not found at any other French restaurants in Singapore, great service, and lovely French decor. Like stepping into Paris.
5
I have been here with my wife as well as for business. It suits both and they have food for every type of taste, all the dishes I tried were very well done.
4
Used to go here a lot, now rarely, because the lamb chops (best ones I've had in Singapore) are no longer on the menu. The place is quaint with characteristic French charm. Bar across the street. Good for dates and intimate dinners. Hang around Tras street for drinks after
4
Nicely designed brasserie with a definite feel of Paris about the place. Mixture of French and Singaporean staff and clientele. The food was very good. Simple French food, beautifully cooked.We had the French onion soup (excellent with stringy cheese!), a couple of seared steaks (tender and tasty), the lobster (a little rich) and pan seared cod with lentils and mushrooms (moist cod and al dente lentils), with a serving of creamy mash and hot crispy fries. All excellent! This restaurant would have scored 5 stars, but sadly was let down by the service. It was not a busy night, yet we struggled to get served. Nobody seemed to be responsible for our table, requests were put in (water, mustard, menus) and had to be re-requested, waiters almost seemed to deliberately avoid making eye contact in case we wanted something. A bit odd and certainly not "French" in terms of service
4
I'm not a great fan of French food but picked this restaurant as it was close tomy friend's office and he felt like French food. I had the bone marrow on toast as my starter and the cod as my main course. Both were really good. Fish isn't always done well but this time round, the cod was tender and moist. i will come back again
3
The decor of the place was quite comfortable and not to snobbish. Lovely little place tacked away in the heart of the central business district. Like what they described..."Expect hearty French classics and decor straight from the 1930s at Brasserie Gavroche. Three-horned chandeliers, dark wood antique furniture, art deco lampshades and reddish-brown leather banquettes set the scene at this white-tableclothed brasserie and bar. Framed old photographs and recipes by chef Frédéric Colin’s grandfather complete the picture." -Time Out SingaporeThe appetizer needs to be shared between 2 persons for each plate... cos they are quite a healthy serving size, and not your tiny little portions usually served in many other places. we had Terrine de foie gras du Périgord et pain de campagne which is the Terrine of Périgord duck liver with toasted country breadand Tartare de saumon au raifort et citron  which is Salmon tartare with fresh horseradish and lemonSalmon was a bit too creamy for our liking, otherwise it's quite tasty.For the mains that we had, we enjoyed them tremendously , tasty and again quite a decent size portion. we had Vol-au-vent au homard et fruits de mer which is the Lobster and seafood with béchamel sauce, puff pastry ( in my opinion was done perfectlyand a shredded duck confit with potatoes in a caserole...(I cannot find it in the on line menu, so sorry no french description) But a lovely dish to have. My friend and i was satiated with the portions of the meals. We would definitely comeback to try the other interesting diishes when we have our French cravings again. And the crew of this place, did a wonderful job, and we enjoyed ourselves there very much.
5
In Singapore my first choice wouldn't be French food, but under the circumstances I could not choose. However, the restaurant was a very pleasant surprise - the waiter was very good (attentive, but not overly so) and the food was as good as anything I've had in France. I chose the quenelle as the main course and it was simply excellent
4
Suggestions for customers1) we ordered 3 dishes, snails as appetizer, grandpa hotpot and duck confit with grated potatoes and all were great. Portion of hot pot is big so order when you are hungry or have someone to share with2) waiters are all caucasian and service is pretty good3) we wanted to go Saturday night and didn't book so we had to go at 930pm4) we wore casual (ie jeans and shorts) but the rest of customers wear high heels, dresses, heavy make ups and light jacket (no one stopped us so I think no dress code)5) ordered one app, two main, one glass of wine and costed $140 see the photo with receipt for detailsFeedback for restaurants1) super noisy - i have to yell for my husband to hear me2) can you direct some traffic to your bar/cafe across street? Too crowded with seating. I just wanted to eat and get out!!3) can you serve warm bread? What we had was cold and tough to chew4) can you give butter/bread knife?
3
What a disappointing evening. We came with 6 friends and service was poor. Food orders were confused and one lady sat with no food while we all ate. No appology that they had NOT taken the right order for her. Staff did not seem happy. No friendly banter from the staff. I would not go agai
5
I only was introduced to this restaurant about a month or two ago and have since been a few times.
Love everything about it, the atmosphere, the food, staff, choice of food/wine and location.
5
Had the recommended quail and nice bottle of french wine .Even i didnt order anything else but my 3 other friends were very satisfied with the frog legs and steak even though the fish is a little disapointing
5
Great French food in a typical brasserie setting, no thrills, no pompous dish names, just great products… and wine
5
Excellent French cuisine done by Frederic Colin who takes pride in the ingredients he is using. Loved the set menu, we had an excellent time there.
5
A wonderfully authentically decorated brasserie. The food was good wholesome French cooking. My wife and I shared a bone marrow on toast as a starter and we for mains we went for safe (steak frites) since it was so highly recommended and adventurous (lobster & seafood vol-au-vents). both were excellent! I was surprised that for a small steak (bat 200-220 grams) they managed to sear the surface so well yet maintain the pinkness inside. The vol-au-vent was drenched in a lobster bisque - quite decadent. I would not recommend having a whole one to yourself as it could be a bit of a cream overload. As usual, my wife and I shared everything including the cheese selection.The place is quite unpretentious yet impressive enough to bring someone special. The wow factor is certainly the food!
4
We arrived an hour early for drinks across the street where they own a little cafe as well. Had a flight of wine and an appetizer there first and then we went back across the street to the restaurant. The restaurant is lovely and will really make you think you are in Europe. When we arrived at 7:15pm the place was still completely empty except for two men who they sat us directly next to at a small table boxed in by a potted plant on one side. Very tight!! We asked to move to another table. It felt weird being 12 inches from two other guests in a totally empty restaurant. We also noticed as the night went on and other guests started to arrive many were not happy with their tables and asked several time to be moved. Their seating arrangements are not great and ti might be something they want to work on. We ordered several appetizers which were all fantastic. Escargot, Bone marrow, Fois Gras, basically all the classics. Husband wanted a cocktail before dinner but apparently they no longer have a cocktail menu? That is odd because they were able to make cocktails. For the sake of improving business they might want to fix that! As far as dinner it was totally lovely! I had a seafood pastry and my husband had steak tartar which he said was the best he ever had! We finished the meal with Crepe Suzette and it came with a single candle that was melted on to the plate to hold it upright. A nice touch! Husband finished with a French aperitif. Our total meal cost including the flight and appetizer across the street was about $400sgd (with the added vat and service) I would recommend this place to others. :)

Had a great meal here with friends, menu is very French and of great quality. Good wine card too. Atmosphere is fun and buzzy , so you should give it a shot. The street is full of restaurants with some being more miss then hit ! Service is good but French surely ness comes to play at time ! Reminds of a saying everything is great about France except the French ! Kidding of coarse. Anyway fun place to go , all that I will say is that it will leave a hole in your wallet . Enjo

We went to this French restauant in Singapore on 66 Tras Street. The food was very French and good, the service generally pleasant and the staff friendly. The interior decor is simple and elegant.. We enjoyed all the items except the oysters. My son ate 3 of the 6 oysters served and when he said they did not taste fresh. I said "don't eat any more lest you might get sick". Either they were not refrigerated/stored properly or they have not sitting around for a while. In any event we returned the oysters saying we felt we did not want to consume them and no replacement was needed. When the bill came, they charged us for the full 6 oysters. I thought they could have charged for only 3 or better still, not charged us at all for the not so fresh oysters. I decided not to argue about it and just paid up, but nothwithstanding their high quality,I personaly will not return to this restaurant again. There are so many good restaurants around in Singapore. What a pity though.On the other hand, if anybody wants to try it out, just don't order oysters

I have visited Gavroche a number of times for lunch and dinner and have always had good service and quality food. While the menu may be a tick pricey for some it is worth it. I recommend this restaurant without hesitation ... just not always easy to get a table
3
Food quality is reasonably consistent - good but not exceptional. Standard menu for lunch / dinner. Can be quite expensive for lunch (100 ph. no drinks) and the food is too rich for lunch. Service was terrible despite the restaurant being 20% full. Would not visit again, Significantly better options exist on Tras Street uitself
4
Authentic good French food, of course it's not cheap but the execution of the food is excellent, service was good overall.
4
Nice food served in significant portion, share your salad or you will struggle to finish your main course. Went with my wife and we had a really nice dinner.
4
simple menu; authentic and good wines. Relatively affordable meal and nice chic french ambience conducive both for couples as well as large groups
4
Just ahead of the year end holidays, the place is packed with celebrants. The authentic brasserie decor, menu, food cooked to everyone's pleasure. Good wine and bubbly, profiterole for a birthday boy. Yes the starter was so generous I had half dozen oysters for my main. Sympathy gained me taste of dover sole (one of our favorites), steak onglet and "stolen" fries.I've never been here for lunch and I agree, these are fine dining prices - typical for Singapore
5
No set lunch. Ala carte is expensive but very good and generous sized portions. Some dishes come with a bucket of fries, which is way too much for one person to finish, but worth it :) Dessert definitely meant to be shared as each dish is large!
4
Nicely designed brasserie with a definite feel of Paris about the place. Mixture of French and Singaporean staff and clientele. The food was very good. Simple French food, well cooked. Not outstanding, but very good and reasonably priced. Only one problem.....the starters were so good and big, that we were pretty full by the time the main courses arrived! Recommend the oysters, saumon tartare, foie gras, steak frites and contrary to some reviews the pork hot pot was well received.
5
This small 60 seats restaurant in Tars street invites you to a journey back to Paris - its really an authentic and true French Brasserie - so from the decoration to the menu, the casual service setting and ambiance - great all together. The food - under the leadership of Chef Frederic - is brilliant -he builds his signature dishes on the family heritage - his grandfathers recipes and more - and its consistently well executed. Its a casual restaurant - if you are looking for fine dining this is not your place - its a family run Brasserie - and hands down - brilliantly done

this is my favorite french restaurant in singapore for my girlfriend and i !!!People who work there are nice !Food is good ! Simple french cuisine like home !!! when i miss french food that the place to i go all the time with my girlfriend ! We ve been there more than 20 times in 4 years...For me its always a good choice.

Visited Gavroche last night, was pleased to hear a number of french accents when we walked in.The decor is very authentic and has a great feel. It was packed. Another good sign..Started with fois gras which was excellent - a favourite of mine. My wife started with the frogs legs and was not impressed not served on the bone and too much garlic.Main course I had the Pork Hotpot which was bland.. my wife had the Duck Confit which was delicious..The serving were substantial and rich so we did not opt for a dessert.I had not read the trip advisor reviews but they now make sense.. some dishes are great other no so much.The service was ok.. but we did have to call over the waiter to make our orders and ask for the bill maybe they were just busy.

Having lived close to 5 years in Paris several years ago one may experience the best of the best French cuisine has to offer. I was looking for an authentic French restaurant for quite some time in Singapore and finally found what I was looking for. A typical French Brasserie with its unique interior design. Not just another "ang moh" place where dishes are just average and overpriced. The foie gras, pate en croute or salmon tartare is definitely worth visiting this charming restaurant again and again. Grand pere Henri certainly also put all his skills into the main courses on offer ... the steak tartare or rumpsteak is delicious and cooked the way you really wanted it. For those who prefer a dessert ... Profiteroles or Tarte Tartin. Ambience is great and cosy, the staff is very attending and the owners truly French.A wonderful and recommended experience ... Bon apetit

Good ambiance with good food and attentive staff.
The mussel was fresh and delicious,
Please bring back the Ox-tail menu.

Booked this restaurant after hearing about from friends. Refused to pre read TripAdvisor just to have a sense of how good it really is..or just another "ang moh" eatery hype.Ambience is great. Intimate and cosy. Food value is definitely great. For local Singaporeans dont order the Grandpa Henri Pork Pot. My closest description is its like a ang moh version of a bak kut teh..without the savoury flavor. Its flavor is helped along by the onions only. However..the roast ribeye steak was gorgeous!!! Aircon needs to be stronger. Ok i know this is a french restaurant..but it doesnt mean i need to smell like the french without cologne. (Grin)Service is great. Julian..i think hes the manager.. has an attentive staff.

Still my favorite French in Singapore. Good traditional fare, good wines, good service, good atmosphere.Complimentary cheese puffs are always good!Our favorites - dover sole and a few nights ago- it was the best. The fish was "sweet" and not too thin, the bones were grilled to crispy that we could eat them, yet fish was not overcooked. Pronounced perfect!Saumon tartare and steak tartare (ordered by 2 from our little group of 4) were also pronounced good as was the smoked duck salad.Wine pouring was generous.We were too full for dessert but madeleines were offered. We felt that with 4 diners, we were entitled to take home 4, but the management stood firm on 2 for takeaway. And we are regulars!Tut-tut, the small details....

I'm probably not the best judge, what with my limited French dining experience (Guy Savoy and Robouchon in Singapore, a few cafes in Paris/London, etc.), but the food here comes across as being .... just so-so. We've been looking to try out some new French ever since perennial favourite, Guy Savoy MBS, shut down, and decided why not here. I think I read somewhere that the chef had an excellent stint previously at St. Regis.2 appetizers: duck liver terrine, and escargots. The Girlfriend loves foie gras, so it's a guaranteed order when its available. Still can't decide whether its made in-house or store bought (don't laugh, loads of Parisian cafes do this), but it tasted pretty good with the relish and hot toast. 7/10.Not much to say about the escargot, except its not something I'd order here again. 5/102 mains: quail stuffed with foie gras, and duck with orange sauce.Now I know the French are good with their fowl, and I freely admit I haven't eaten enough to definitively say whether it's executed right or not. However, I do love to eat (ALOT!), and these 2, my friends, is not very good eating. The quail is bland, and lacks the richness you'd expect from the foie gras. 6/10. The duck, on the other hand, is simply foul (no pun intended). It's dry on the edges, very chewy on the inside, and distinctly unlikable. What a shame. 3/10.Dessert: millefeuille.Tasty vanilla cream sandwiched between sugary, flaky pastry, served with raspberry sherbet. Split down the middle on this. The Girlfriend didn't like it - something about the pastry tasting burnt. I loved it. Well, I wrote the review so it gets an 8/10!Service was what you'd expect from this price range. Speaking of which, bill came up to SGD$220, including a glass of wine each, so not exactly cheap. We noticed quite a few French-speaking diners, and the joint was packed on a Sat evening, so it must be doing something right. Perhaps, just not our taste. To each his own
4
Overall, this is a good restaurant - décor and service are good, menu is traditional but well executed - it does lack consistency; some days are clearly much better than others. Nonetheless, a very solid address in this area and an authentic French brasserie experience... on most days..
4
Très chic dining experience; and sister of Cafe Gavroche (also worth a visit!) - a lovely light atmosphere, with excellent service; and great menu choices for fine French faireAlthough at the higher end of the price spectrum; I didn't mind paying more; because the service was attentive; the food portions decent; clean, quirky and quaint all at the same time. I came back to work in the afternoon, a little stuffed, but suitably happy
3
Really nice inside, good service and decent food. Between us, we had the bone marrow and onion soup to start - both decent but nothing much to write home about. For mains, we chose a stuffed rabbit leg and the lamb rump - again, both were good. No real complaints. The reason I give this place three stars is that with two glasses of wine each the meal came to 200+ Singaporean dollars and, ultimately, we both left underwhelmed. For this price, I imagine there are a lot better restaurants in Singapore to try

Dined at Brasserie Gavroche for the second time last week, and had a delightful dinner. The cod was cooked perfectly, the portion substantial. My previous visit saw me ordering the escargots as a starter (nicely done) and the steak frites.The restaurant features an expansive wine selection (as one might expect from a French restaurant). The decor is classic bistro style. It's all very good, but what stands out is the service -- quite excellent - and in Singapore, where restaurants are all too often understaffed, it makes a difference. The only off-putting thing I found is when making the reservation online, the restaurant makes clear that a 7:30p reservation must be done by 9:30p, a warning also made by the staff who later called to confirm the reservation. I understand the need to turn tables, but as my friend and I approached the witching hour, we found ourselves rushing. Fortunately, the place wasn't that busy that particular evening, and we were allowed to stay and enjoy another glass of wine.In all, BG offers great food and ambiance and even better value -- not pricy by Singapore standards. Recommended

A great venue for a romantic dinner. Traditional French bistro style decor, crisp and efficient service and great food: escargots, steak frites, steak tartare, French salad, crepes Suzette etc. Solid French wine list and digestifs. My only criticism was the absence of a subtle light source on the tables (candles). Makes the menu a bit difficult to read. Lots of customers using the flashlight on their cells to see! Will certainly return
4
This is as close as you can come in Singapore to a classic French bistro. Atmosphere is perfect. Menu is traditional. Service is what you would expect. Excellent bread. Boutique pastis. Perfect pate. Fresh sole Meuniere. Crisp fries. I wanst crazy about the recommended tarte tatin so would try another dessert but the free orange Madeleine was a nice way to finish
4
The steak frites is awesome. Friendly service. Do book early to avoid disappointment. Perfect location for a date night.

We had heard good things about Brasserie Gavroche,and the reception by the owner and the decor were in keeping with the traditions of the French brasserie.However,by the end of the meal,though there was nothing specifically wrong with what we were served,we left feeling disappointed.The pate of my starter was just okay,though the bread that came with it was excellent.The main course of stuffed rabbit on a bed of mashed potato had a look of the microwave about it,and was more in the traditions of nouvelle cuisine rather than the hearty portions one expects from a French brasserie.The crepe suzette dessert was disappointing.As for the wine list,many of the wines were over-priced,though the Bordeaux we ordered was an average price by Singapore's outlandish prices though not very good.Maybe the fault was with us,and we did not order well,as most reviewers favour this restaurant,but for us it was disappointing
5
What a lovely spot for all things French. From the decor, the wine list to the food, this place most certainly captures the spirit of Paris.I was there for dinner with a business associate and amongst us we ordered the Rumsteak d’agneau, ail rose confit et pommel purée (Pan roasted Welsh lamb rump, pink garlic confit and mashed potatoes), Cuisse de lapin farcie aux champignons et herbes, pommes purée (Stuffed rabbit leg with mushrooms and herbs, mashed potatoes) and a few glasses of Bordeaux, but of course.The servings were fairly small. But looks are deceiving. Any plans we had of ordering desserts were put on hold. We were pretty stuffed, and with a huge grin plastered on our faces! Kudos to Chef Frédéric Colin and his team. Merci beacoup! And we will be back for those desserts
4
Started with a drink across the road at Cafe & Bar Gavroche, which is relaxed and tastefully done. Over at Brasserie Gavroche we had to take an 830pm seating on a busy Friday night which did mean the place was pretty empty when we left.Couldn't fault the food. Four of us shared starters of the charcuterie and pork terrine. The lamb, rabbit leg and sirloin steak were all excellent.Wine, like most Singapore restaurants, is over-priced but a one for one policy (one bottle max I believe) makes it more palatable. I did feel the food was fairly priced but still budget for $100-150 a person for dinner if you are drinking wine and making an evening of it.The service has a hurried and French bistro feel to it. Efficient but don't expect lots of warm and fuzzies.Overall, we thought this place was a pretty big hit
4
We particularly enjoyed:- Great welcome: although without booking, staff could arrange a table for us (2)- Variety and quality of food- Staff was always there to serve and take our requests- Reasonable price for high quality French foodWe will definitely go there again !!

Gavroche is a place that would be overpriced in Paris, where brasserie are supposed to be cheap restaurant, but it is also a place that wouldn t be disqualified in Paris regarding food quality. I have been there 4 or 5 times in the last year, I have tried many of there dishes and I have never been disappointed. Sure it is not cheap but it is definitely very well made. The Ingredients are good, it is very well cooked, carefully prepared and it tastes just right.The restaurant has a "Parisian restaurant decoration" one that doesn t look fake (which is good as there are many other restaurants in singapore that try to look like a Parisian one and end up with a lame cheap decoration).Definitely my best brasserie style french restaurant in singapore. Not cheap but it consistently delivers a quality and tasty brasserie food. Not so easy to find in singapore

My experience with the restaurant has been extremely disappointing and I am compelled to share it. I booked a table at the restaurant for a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday. The booking was made 9 days in advance of the date. The attendant on the phone informed me that they could only do an early seating at 6:30 and would have to have the table back by 8:30. I confirmed the reservation (provided a name, phone number etc.) and requested her to get the manager to call me back to check if I would definitely have to vacate the table by 8:30. However, I did not hear back from the restaurant and just accepted that we would have to make do with the 630 to 830 reservation. 3 days before the booking date, I called them back to confirm the reservation. The manager informed me that there was no reservation. He refused to check with his staff or to even try and figure out why my reservation was not on the list. His response was "No one informed me so there is no reservation". I appreciate that there might have been a communication error, however, the way in which he spoke to me was rude and completely unacceptable. When I mentioned that i was extremely disappointed and would have to share this with others, his response was "OK. Go ahead". Bottom line is - if you are looking to host an important event then this establishment is not reliable or helpful
5
Feel good French dining at its best, with perfectly executed courses. Food menu is not extensive but offers something for everyone. My only qualm is that I was at the Gavroche wine bar across the street before dinner and had set my eyes on some wines which were not available to order at the Brasserie although they are sister outlets under one name
3
I was asked, after finally getting the attention of a server and requesting a menu.main gripe, the place is understaffed, service was slow, they forgot my coffee order too. Foodwise, we had the onion soup, steak frites, lamb shank, profiteroles all non-descript, dessert underwhelmingMain selling points, ambience, good wine selection, and they have cigar

This review is long overdue. I have been in this restaurant many times. And always forget to say something about it. My first visit was around 2012 with my family. And it was really good experience. Interior: The first impression when you see this restaurant from outside was... It looks plain. But once you open the door..BONJoUR!The interior was superb. Most of the furnitures looks so antique to me. Wonder how they managed to bring those furnitures inside the restaurant.?! Every details of the restaurant will reminds you of the old Paris.Food: How am I gonna forget the complimentary cheese breads?!and the most memorable dish was the bamboo clams....unfortunately they don't have this anymore.I had a steak , for main which is pretty HUge. For the price, it's really worth it! They do recommend the grandpa Henri hot pot. Too bad we didn't order that time.The next few visits are with my friends and colleagues. Which they do really enjoy. And on the third visit I finally tried the popular grandpa henri's hot pot... The meat really melts in your mouth. The meat is so soft!! One of my fav!!highly recommended. WINE: they have good selection of wine. And I noticed that they change it the last time I visited. Aswell as the food. Guess they follow the seasonal food in France. SERVICe: Don't be surprised to see good looking French guys serving your table. Which will complete your Parisian experience.But they are not snooty like those in paris. Since we always had a table bookedOn the 2nd seating, we always managed to see the chef/owner. chef Frederic is really funny and cool chef! Overall: it's worth the trip. Good food and good wine. All you need is a good companion.Just make sure you reserve a table if your planning to go for dinner. And highly recommend the second seating if you want to stay longer. Parking is a issue, so better asked when you called to reserved a table!

I am french therefore I can tell you Brasserie Gavroche is a very good restaurant. You have very good dishes without any mistakes. Atmosphere is good: you are in Paris. Wine selection is good as well. We will come back soon
3
Nice atmosphere. We've been here a few times, and the experience has been consistent: good, simple bistro food, and pretty lousy service. In this category, i think le Bistro du Vin offers slightly better value.
5
Had a wonderful meal at the brasserie Gavroche.
The sirloin steak was cooked to perfection and the champagne delicious.
Wonderful company and very friendly staff
I'll be sure to visit again when I'm next in Sing

Service was great but the food was a bit obvious French unfortunately I have been to better French restaurants in SGP. Food well executed but just missed something.
4
What a fabulous find in Tanjong Pagar. A lovely little french bistro. The decor was lovely & the menu fairly extensive. We had a lovely dinner and told the head waiter (a Frenchman) that it was better than a real french bistro because the service was so much friendlier. The wine was great, the food was hot, the service was friendly, and all in a fabulous atmosphere & with appropriate french music playing in the background.Apparently they have a sister restaurant almost directly across the road which is more like a cafe & they do breakfast/brunch on the weekends. We will definitely be giving that a try : ) We booked early (6:30) which really helped with parking (on the street w/coupons) otherwise I am not sure how difficult it would be to find a parking space
4
Finding this restaurant is an absolute delight...We felt welcomed and most importantly not rushed or pushed to order expensive dishes.Ample time was given between our appetizer and main course, meaning that we did not feel like food was forced on us quickly so that the table would be vacated asap.The ambiance and decor are reminiscent of Paris..
2
Good is not too bad but it can be extremely noisy due to the crowd and small space. However, the service is very disappointing. I was left unattended at the table for more than half an hour whilst waiting for my overseas guests who arrived late. Not even a glass of water was offered.The waiters are not exactly helpful when they give you the impatient stare whilst you ask a for suggestions. I also can't help to smell racism when the waiters constantly refilled the wine glasses of my Caucasian guests and not mine. My last draw was when I called for the bill, it went to my one of my Caucasian guest. I guess this restaurant probably doesn't really welcome locals
4
This restaurant is quite small, so if you want to eat at a specific time with a large group, make reservations well in advance. Excellent interiors, similar to bistros/brasseries in France. Service staff could have been friendlier. Wasn't served cheese puffs (was it because we did not order any wine?). Refilling of tap water was slow and I wonder why they didn't just place a carafe on the table, considering there were 6 of us.It's puzzling that BG does not have a non - alcoholic drinks menu. The service staff seemed to be trying to get us to spend as much as possible, as they kept asking if we wanted to order wine and additional courses. My baked pork terrine and quenelles were excellent, but I would have preferred more crayfish sauce with the latter.For those who are wondering, the texture of the quenelles is akin to mashed potatoes. The chocolate tarte was good with a very fine, crispy crust, but the chocolate itself could have been hotter. Complimentary madeleines were served at the end of the meal
5
Love this place and the Cafe Gavroche across the street. Husband loves going to Brasserie Gavroche for the steak tartar and steak. I love the pork stew / broth that comes served in a pot. The little cheesey pastries served when you sit down are divine (and warm) as well as the tasty madelines (sp?) served at the end of the meal. Love the cookie also served for dessert. Lovely service, nice atmosphere and wine list also very good.The cafe across the street is also adorable, feels like we could be on the streets in France. Love the decor and atmosphere. The food was also very good. Everything from the street flooring to the "kitchen dining" room table to the covered courtyard is so French. Had the Croque Madame and Scrambled eggs on toast with tomatoes and olive spread for brunch. The olive spread on the toast with the scrambled eggs was a bit salty. The only thing was they didn't serve the food at the same time. So my husband got his dish and finished it before my dish even arrived :(Despite that, it was worth the wait and both dishes were incredible and will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu options

When I'm looking for a traditional french meal (french comfort food) in Singapore, this place is on the top of my list. The food is consistently good - I've not had a bad experience here so some of the negative reviews are a bit surprising to me. I've rated the restaurant Excellent mainly for the reason that I have always had an enjoyable meal here. Among the starters, both the foie gras and pork (pate en croute) terrines are excellent and a friend has said the onion soup is also good. Among the mains, the duck confit, which is in a different style from the norm (a casserole style), is excellent. I've also had the fish quenelle and pork hotpot, both good. Frederic changes the menu occasionally so I'm still waiting for his roast chicken to make a comeback. Among the desserts, I would recommend the Crepes Suzette, Tarte Tatin and Mille Feuille. The restaurant does get busy and the problems in Singapore with a shortage in the service labor pool can make service a tad slow, but not exceedingly worse than in some other similar places. The service team has a couple of french waiters who know their stuff so I would suggest to grab them if you have any questions and want to have a wine suggestion to go with the meal. I normally go for a bottle of La Grange Neuve (second wine of Chateau Figeac). I don't find the pricing of the dishes to be that expensive given the quality of the ingredients and relative to other French restaurants in Singapore. I would say that it's priced decently (eating out in Singapore restaurants is not that cheap, alas)
5
We always go to this place and have great meals. It's not too pricy for SIngapore standards, but it offers authentic French cuisine with great service and dishes.
3
Run by French - who have classic Parisian malaise,in not liking service and arrogant.
Make you want to turn around and leave before you reach the table
Food portions generous and good but brasserie standard, prices are steep.
5
Although the price isn't cheap (but hey, this is Singapore), I really enjoy going to this eatery from time to time.It is just the way it should be, honest, straightforward and uncomplicated French Brasserie food.If you have the chance to speak with the Boss/Chef you will quickly understand that he knows his way into the kitchen with a very strong background of French cuisine and top 5stars hotels.I would recommend it to any French expat, or French tourist
3
Very nice place well located in a little street in Singapore. The atmosphere is cosy and you will have the impression to be in a typical French Brasserie. The food is very good with a lot of choice of European dishes. The service is a bit slow. But even if the food is good the prices are too much expensive, especially the wine.

In my opinion the most reliable test of a french restaurant trained chef is the escargots, and it just lacked any real depth of flavour or sense of accomplishment, the rest of the meal followed suit. I’m not describing my escargots plate, let’s just say I’d rather to stay hungry than eat it again.None of the food wowed me. I made the mistake of bringing a business partner there and let me just say if it wasn’t for the company the experience would have been ruined. The Crepe Suzette was a disaster that tasted like a bottle of peroxide – too booze-y for my taste. Though the shrimp and avocado salad and pan roasted grouper and scallop were not bad, I expected a ton of flavour but didn’t get it.Bottom line – not so FAB. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

Right from a friendly and painless reservation to its simple, comfortable and relaxed setting, BG just sets you up for a relaxed evening of back to basics French brasserie dining, and they do it well! Service was attentive and friendly and every item ordered that evening by our party did not disappoint. Fresh oysters, foie gras, the oxtail special, sea bass, steak, were all done very nicely with nothing to fault. BG is definitely a keeper on my list of favorite French restaurants in Singapore

In Singapore, everyone talks about places to eat and drink. Constantly. And sadly, the more people rave about a place, the more commercial, bland, homogenous and confected it seems to be.For all the excited talk about truly average places, I wonder why there is not more talk about fantastic places like Gavroche, both the Brasserie and Cafe Gavroche across the street.I was recently taken to Gavroche by a French friend. I was immediately taken with the old school metal window grills, the beautifully tiled interior, and the natural lighting.For appetizer I had bone marrow and for main I had steak tartare, probably not the kind of dishes everyone enjoys, but heaven for me. The bone marrow was moist and bursting with flavour, perfectly complemented by the oil preserved garlic and the crusty bread base. The steak tartare had me close to tears of joy. Hands down, the best steak tartare I have had in Singapore, with the perfect balance of quality beef, creamy egg, acidity and pepper. It came with a generous bucket of mouth watering fries. I downed the meal with a reasonably priced burgundy and I topped it off with an excellent macchiato.The service was efficient and attentive. The worst I can say is that my macchiato was a little slow.No, Gavroche is not cheap, our bill was just under $200 for two, but that covers three courses and a glass of wine for my friend, two courses and coffee for me. For what you get, it is great value.The lovely tiled decor isn't great at absorbing sound, so it can get a little loud, but not unbearably so. The natural light can also suffer dramatic changes from a sky littered with moving clouds, but it's a nice change from insipid but steady man-made lighting.If you like fine French food, book a table at Gavroche

I enjoyed all , with the only down , the acoustic !The welcoming , the choice of drinks , had a lovely bone marrow tartine at Bar first , some great champagne by the glass at a very reasonable price ...once we sat down...all that i like was on the menu ..authenticity , served in generous portions , excellent and friendly service ..what else can you ask

My wife and I invited two of our friends who love French cuisine and we were attracted by the menu showing a few typical French dishes that are not often available in Singapore. So top marks for the menu and we had a lot of expectations. When it came to execution it was a basket of mixed successes and failures. The Salmon tartar was a nice appetizer but my Escargots (snails) were served with a butter sauce without garlic at “warm" temperature so very unforgivable as this is a real French classic. The foie gras en croute (baked pork terrine with duck liver) was good and so was the goat cheese salad. The entrees were also a mixed success. The Shredded duck confit (that looked pre-cooked) was too salty and so were the two Bavettes (Grilled Angus flank steak). The bavettes portions were generous and beside the excessive salt, were very well cooked and tasty. The roasted potatoes accompanying the bavettes were "mushy" more like a “wet” gratin and obviously pre-cooked, the taste was not very nice and we would have preferred to have real fresh roasted potatoes as done in Paris.For the desert, the Profiteroles were generous and tasty but, the Tarte Tatin was obviously prepared in advance, too thick, served barely warm (maybe just re-heated), the caramel was missing and it was not an appetizing desert. The wine was nice and reasonable in price. The service was very good and friendly.Overall, I expected more talent from the cuisine, more "fresh" cooking rather than "ready made” and for over $600 for four people it should have been near perfection instead of below average

Nice casual French style brasserie with very friendly and professional service. Indeed it us true as we know that 'friendly' can be an issue in these type of establishments.And the food is very good with a great choice in dishes. We had a warm artichoke mussel salad and a tuna tartare with avocado starter. Delicious they were. Then sole meuniere and duck confit to follow. Great flavours. Only the rum baba was disappointing, while the tart-a-tin was good.We will return, thank you

Good food but if someone asked for what they thought of if they thought of French food this would BG's menu it would be nice to see some originality, was a good to take clients though :)
5
We had three courses menu with my wife. Both of us took meat for main course and it was delicious. We had some free Madeleines for dessert. Staff is really nice.
4
Nice french brasserie in Singapore. The food was authentical and tasted as in France. The price is, as in most similar restaurants in Singapore, of course a bit too high. However if you would like to taste real bistro style french food this is the place to go

The atmosphere of this brasserie in Singapore is very genuine indeed. The decor, the french staff and even some of the food reminds me very much of places in France.They didn't have the mussels the night we went due to some supplier issues.The food was alright. Not fantastic. I liked the chef's creations better when he was at St. Regis.The dessert was tge highlight

We had a great dinner at brasserie Gavroche. I was also pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the wines by the glass. I had escargots with a glass of haut medoc as a starter. Then moules marinieres with a Sancerre. Both dishes were very good. My mrs had a tartare de crevettes and a bavette a l'echalotte. The tartare was stunning. The profiteroles for dessert were excellent.The restaurant (decor, mirrors and furniture) really makes you feel as if you we're in a upper end Parisien brasserie. The service was good and French speaking, adding to the experience. What I would have liked to avoid:Having to ask for lemon water to rinse my fingers after eating the mussels.The ambient noise can be quite intense at times.The lighting is a little low which can make reading the menu difficult. The wines are pricey, even by the glass ~$18 but, the glasses i had were very good.Overall a really good authentic French experience (some may say stereotypical, but remember, you are in Singapore). I will definitely go back, soon.

After deciding to give Brasserie Gavroche a try rather than revisit Absinthe, I can't help feel that the bistro failed to live up to expectations and seemed to 'mis-fire' somewhat throughout the evening. First impressions were good from the very French door (note the centrally placed door handle) to the Parisian feel - having just recently visited France there were some very nice authentic touches. It was a shame that we held open the door for the maitre d' to enter the restaurant from outside rather than the other way around....The selection on the menu had a good range throughout but again two of the dishes we chose were actually not available that evening...it would have been nice to have been advised this beforehand.And so starting with escargot & onion soup (both fine but nothing special) we moved onto the entrees.The ox tongue and duck confit, although arriving in unexpected styles, were quite passable and left us full. But again the course was slightly blighted by having to ask for wine to be topped up throughout the meal.We passed on the dessert being quite full. Noting the price was slightly high for what we had eaten, we also left slightly disappointed that the restaurant had not taken hede of the notice that one of the party were celebrating their birthday...

French food was always good when there was Le Cascade Le Notre and then there was L'Angelus, owned and run by Frenchmen with flair .Then many others jumped into the fray and other cuisines competed for our palate and placemats .So when Braaserie Gavroche was suggested for a birthday treat , we went with ambivalence . Prices were intimidating and our request for table water was not quite rejected but ....However we were not disappointed . The starters of seafood in vol a vents , rilletes ,salad nicoise and cold cuts with early sides of fries and rye baguette were excellent and authentic .Selection of the mains was limited but the sole was done perfectly with crisp sides yet tender . The meat was quite average though or perhaps we do them pretty well at home anyway . They did not have my favorite side dish , spinach.and what was termed roast potatoes were pan fried in way too much butter and oil . Dessert was mixed . Mille feulle was dry and the choc mousse was good but pricey at 14 dollars for a tiny portion .Service was smart but tended to be haughty especially the manager but it was just like Paris anyway . Efficient , no nonsense and unobtrusive .Go if you feel like spouting . At least it is worth i

We had an excellent experience at this restaurant. We try french restaurants all the time but this one offers something really special. First of all a different menu from all the other french restaurants in Singapore which is very refreshing. We had a salad with artichoke and clams which had a very particular taste (you love or hate it, I LOVED it). Then we had the tongue which was divine and the cod which I thought it had a Portuguese touch but the waiter told me it was 100% french (from Britannic region in France). We had the dessert of the day which was delicious too.The atmosphere is excellent. I am definitely going back...

Overall the place was ok. Atmosphere was very nice and reminiscent of a Parisian bistro. Prices are reasonable and the food portion size is generous. I had the steak tartare, which lacked flavor as it was under seasoned. It was tough to finish. Service was disappointing. We had to repeatedly ask for water (and then refills) - perhaps they were unhappy we didn't buy bottled water (though we did order a $100 bottle of wine). Anyway, the place had good atmosphere, we were with friends and it was not a bad experience. I'm not rushing to go back though

We had just arrived from Paris and our party of six were lucky to have a booking for a busy Saturday night. Our immediate impressions were favourable with the authentic ambiance of a quality French Restaurant. Our entree specials of fresh melons dishes provided a delicious start to our dinner and our mains of Angus steak filets were superbly cooked and presented. One couple were upsold a Chateaubriand option which turned out to be of very generous proportions and also very enjoyable.Some crepes suzettes completed our meals and provided us with a memorable overall experience. Would recommend for very good food, professional service and authentic french experience in a restored historic shophouse site
