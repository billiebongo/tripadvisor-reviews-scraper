This place is a real Brasserie as you can find in France
Great set menu(s) with a qualified French speaking staff
Bon appétit

French Beer, French Wine, French Food. That is all, and it's all great. Get there early for a good seat so you can see all the passing traffic in Club Street. Enjoy

They have great prices and happy hours here for wine. I have never had any food here, but the service by the French manager is great. Highly recommended.
5
Coming from France to oragnize an event in Singapore is not so easy. the O'Batignolles help you for everything. I could organize my meeting with 25 guests very easily. Wines and food are very good, like in France.
Thank you.

Good food, great wine, best time with friends.
Ambiance is very good and service is top-notch.
Will definitely go back!

The place it’s just at the corner and it really looks like an old French bistrot. I enjoyed talking to the manager which is a French girl that was previously working in Bangkok, so we’ve just shared opinions and thoughts about living in Asia as expects. She suggested me a beer that was quite good, while my boyfriend took a glass of French wine. We didn’t have the chance to eat anything as the kitchen wasn’t yet open, that’s the reason of the 4 stars. I’ll be back for sure to try the food next time
5
We visited this Bistro while on a walk towards Chinatown and it was such a find. We opted for the set menu consisting of a superb Mushroom soup followed by duck for myself and a beautiful fish for my husband. Completing the meal with petite dessert on a board.We complemented our meal with a delightful glass of champagne. the decor is historical and delightful. if you have time to linger over lunch this is the place
5
Was headed to another place for brunch, but it was closed. My friend & I cycled around and stumbled on O Batignolles & was pleasantly surprised by this cute little corner bistrot! I requested spinach with my Eggs Benedict, because I couldn't decide between Eggs Florentine & Eggs Benedict. The Hollandaise sauce truly won me over & transported me to Rue de Battignolles in Paris. I sampled my friend's croissant & was pleased to find out that it was made the French way -- 80% French butter! Wonderful, relaxed ambience & music, good food. French-owned & run. Will definitely come back for their charcuterie & fromages!
5
Happen to be area the area for after work drinks and end up having the best nights of year. Small intimate bistro, with street side seating for people watching. Wine by glasses allows us to explore fine wines from different France region and the Cheese selection, OMG! So much varieties and very reasonable price too (almost super market prices which is hard to come by in this area) Good value, honest and helpful staff. Will come back if I miss France anytime.

This small and cosy restaurant is a good place to dine in a small group.
Food is ok. Prices are reasonable.
Service is good.
5
Great weekend brunch, lovely staff, good quality wines reasonably priced, excellent salads, good value deals for lunch, super relaxing on weekends ie for a Brunch

Excellent lunch offer
Diverse menu for all
Fresh and tasty cuisine
Convivial and friendly service
Great atmosphère

Cool little bar, small bites eaterie, cheap wines and beers and quick service in excellent location and always friendly atmosphere outside. Nice place.
5
Chilled out with the girlfriends over cheese and wine amongst other mains, awesome location for a girls night out.
5
The ambience of the place is great to chill on any evening, accompanied with a wide range of wine selection. The service is impeccable, courteous and makes everyone feel welcomed to the restaurant. Food wise was excellent. We ordered grilled salmon, French burger, and steak. Burger patty had the hand-made flavour and succulent. Salmon was a tad over-grilled but it was okay. The steak came with a generous portion of pasta and tasted marvellous. All in all, a great place for some French flavour in the city
5
Excellent service on my second visit I was recognised and welcomed. The cafe was full but for one reserved table , the waitress told to sit there and she would get my beer, she said an outdoor table would be available soon and she kept if for me.The next evening I received the same friendly welcome the staff were willing to chat. If back in Singapore I will definitely revisit Great place to spend an hour or so
5
Cool ambience in the club st area. For something different, select some of the cheeses. Fantastic delicious selection. Cocktails were ordinary (why did I order?!) but wine was excellent.We had a soft goats cheese and a hard one. Each comes with a small label! Both were great.We dropped in for a quick snack so also ordered the truffle fries (!)
5
I organized a private event to celebrate the end of my master with my class. The food and the drinks were very good and the service was perfetc. The staff is very friendly. Special mention for the French Chess plater and the quiche. I had an amazing night in O'Batignolles and I highly recommend this spot
5
A glass of Rose, a bottle of Crement (it was Wednesday, special day) salmon rillette, croque monsieur. Good variety of dishes, wine by the glass. Service was welcoming, attentive and personable. We have teturned once and going back again for Sunday breakfast. Warch the world go by on Club Street. Not cheap but very pleasant
5
We visited this lovely bar on more than one occasion and greatly enjoyed it every time. Good winelist, lovely food and some of the nicest service staff we have encountered in Singapore. Recommended
5
Had a great Friday night out at O'Batignolles after a long work week. The cheese is amazing and the overall bill so reasonable.
4
Food was fantastic for such an inexpensive price. The service staff were extremely polite and were quick to tend to our requests.
4
The truffle fries and beef burger was delicious. Warm and relaxing atmosphere! Service level was standard.
5
A dependable and simple lunch venue that offers a taste of France near the CDB. Very good service from the team - friendly and attentive.
4
Food is quite good, do not expect the top quality but prices are reasonnable for a french restaurant in SGP. Service is quite good.
4
Good location, several french wines by the glass, chilled out atmosphere, and food is good enough.Don't expect aircon on a normal day, it can be hot, but it's ok as long as you dress prepared. And the cigarette smoke from the outdoor seats seep inside, which is why we always ask for seats as far away from the smokers as possible
3
We knew about the restaurant for lunch, but it was the 1st time we came for brunch. We booked for 3 but were given a table for 2, which was changed upon request. Food was excellent but the bill was very expensive for standard "Brasserie Parisienne" type of restaurant. The place is not exactly kids friendly: only one menu with ham-fries-salad. We loved the croissants and the scramble eggs plate. I would defintely go back for lunch because they have a set, but probably not for brunch
5
Was actually on way to Chinatown when we came across this place. It is not large and I would try booking if we returned as it was busy but we managed to get a table for two near the pavement (though would not recommend this particular table if possibility of rain)Reasonable amount of choices on menu Food was good portions OK and served promptly by friendly staff. If looking for something different we would be happy to recommen
5
A lively, casual open corner bar with a great French wine and food offer. Great choice of cheese and typical French dishes such as salad nicecoise or croque moniseur. Used a lot for after-work get-togethers and packed as from Wednesdays ...They even sell and deliver their wines.
5
Good Food, Good Wine, accomodating staff's! New to the place and was impressed by the ambiance, food, and the service provided.
5
Very tasty!!!
Recommened: beef steak, salmon, salad, bread with olive oil!
Wine: all of them.
Especially then rain))
5
We are guests at O Batignolles very often and we love the food (the cheese!) and the service. The staff are friendly and very accommodating and food and wine well priced. It is our 'go to' place for wine and cheese!
4
Somewhat slow service, but the food made up for it. I liked that their Sunday brunch menu was available till rather late in the afternoon.
4
We enjoy coming here for 'date night' on Saturdays and always give it a 5 rating. We only gave a 4 this time because they were out of stock for 4 things we ordered. The food quality was still excellent for our 'back up' orders. Thank you

I usually like to get a drink at o'batignolles after work and grab a quick bite to eat however I may have to change my habits after my last experience. I showed up this past Monday 6/2 with a friend and it was a really disappointing experience :- no service : after waiting a while to be attended to i had to go to the counter to order, ok fine however for every other requests/order I had to do the same as if the service was inexistant- bite to eat : out of 5 cheeses I selected only 3 were available. Again this can happen however the presentation was minimal and no condiments on the side.- wine : i order a bottle of white as I usually do when i am not alone... The bottle was not even cold for a white...- ...Overall a pretty bad experience for a place where I have been used to better.Hope this was just a one off
5
Once again we were at O'Batignolles to celebrate my daughter's birthday and once again it was total satisfaction, great food and wonderful atmosphere.The food is always equally good, no difference and disappointment from one visit to another, the service always impeccable and efficient but with a pleasant friendliness making the customer happy and special.Again a wonderful time there and hopefully more to come
5
Aside from this another famous wine bar that everyone's talking about, O Batignolles is definitely one of our go to place if we want to have wines in a relaxing vibe. They offer mainly wines from France! One thing that definitely got me though is their absolutely amazing food! They definitely come a long way from offering a so so food, to offering real food and french cuisine! I was in awe because this was definitely unexpected. I remember going here in the past years and their food was a mediocre but when we were told about their menu and tried it that night, I was really surprised! We went back for lunch and it was packed, no wonder! This used to be just our go to place for french wine and cheese but now, this is our fave place for french food and this is definitely their edge! You can say that this restaurant found their "heart" Congratulations to the Chef! We will definitely go back and hungry for more!!
5
Great place to share a bottle of wine and cheese/cold cut platters. Feel like in Paris. We visited Asia and we missed our foods, after reading the recommandation of Lonely planet, we did not hesitate and it was a great experience. Friendly & helpful staff, wide and affordable wines range. Feeling ready for another 2 months in South East Asia
5
this french bistro has a very cozy ambiance and is a great place to do meet-ups or small gathering. the main reason however that i've went here for 3 times already is because of the great and delicious food they serve! kudos to the chef for making very traditional french cuisine! i'll surely come back again for any new special set:
5
Food is nice, service is good and reasonable price. Am happy with everything there!
Am excited for their free flow croissant in the brunch menu!
4
Would love to see more salad choices like spinach or arugula. Other than that, loved the seafood salad! Thanks for offering healthyou choices for my lunch :)
5
Great atmosphere, service, food, drinks and value for money. French feeling in a big city. Recommended! 😀
4
This restaurant located in a very popular area has recreated a great Parisian atmosphere in the centre of Singapore. You really feel like if you were in Paris. The menu is good the cooking accordingly good and the staff is very professional.

Sitting outside on a nice sunny day could not be better accompanies by a lunch at this lovely French restaurant. If you are looking for something more up market than the classic hawker, but don't want to blow the budget, then the $17 or 18 dollar set menu is perfect. The $17 gives you two courses with a soup started (tomato and cucumber - absolutely lovely) and a Tartine Pouline with a great selection of toppings. I had the goats cheese and it was deliscious. The $18 comes with the soup to start and either a salad, sandwich or quiche. You then get a coffee of your choosing and a trio of small deserts. The presentation of the food was sublime and the waiting staff were very friendly. The one thing I did notice, is that unlike many places, they served the starters and the mains SEPARATE! For me, this was an enormous plus. It can get slightly frustrating when you haven't even finished your starter and the mains suddenly appear, filling up your table. Overall, a fantastic lunch experience, very tasty well presented food and an very pleasant location to relax and have a leisurely lunch. As I'm writing this, and should probably be working, I think that I've just convinced myself to go back today. *stomach rumbles*.. Bon Appetit. I also had a glance at the wine menu *french wines are my favourite*. If you are fond of a Cotes du Provence then this is your place. Affordable and great tasting rose wine

We were looking forward to a good brunch but was disappointed that they serve more of breakfast items and salads rather than brunch. The brunch items that we had chosen, Salmon Eggs Benedict and Croque Madame were mediocre. The positive points are the venue, which was lovely and our service staff, Gurpit, who was really helpful and attentive
4
We sat in a little corner inside the restaurant, away from the main part, which was nice, cozy, and quiet. Everything we ordered was delicious. We had the bacon & cheese quiche, linguine with chicken, herbs, sun dried tomatoes and parmesan sauce, and the pork jambone, with sausage and lentils. Mine was the pork jambone and it was amazing! The meat was so tender, it fell off the bone, and the lentils were cooked to perfection. Everyone agreed my dish was the most delicious, and such value for money! We would definitely come back again
4
If you want a touch of France you found it!Croissants, French Toast, a Glass of value Champagne, would lose e to eat here everyday but alas it's an indulgence!The Eggs Benedict is Awesome, although I was disappointed with there Croque Madame (to big and to much Bechamel) but no ones perfect! The Cheese and Ham Toastie is a better optio

My husband and I went to grab dinner there at around 8.30pm on a Sunday night. Everything went well, and the food was pretty good. Until it came to around 9.25 when we were in the middle of our main course. One of the waiters came up to us and said he had to give us the bill as they were closing the restaurant soon. We were rather taken aback as there was no call for last order. In any case, being the accepting customers we normally were, we said ok, but that my husband wanted a final glass of wine to finish off his main course. The waiter came back a minute later and said no, the bar was closed, so here's the bill (and I still had half of my main course left). What kind of terrible service is this? Felt like we were being chased out of the restaurant. Whoever owns this restaurant, please be aware that just one lousy waiter with a bad attitude can turn your customers off forever. We used to like this place, and are actually rather disappointed that we probably would not want to go back again due to this bad experience
4
As always we enjoyed our time there... very good balance between the great food, friendly but still efficient service, and a comfortable atmosphere.Waiters never put pressure on customers, and unlike most places in Spore, they remember regular clients and have always a friendly and welcoming wor
4
Good place for a good wine and meal. I had the skirt steak which was unbelievable. Portion was a little small but it was filling. They also have good set lunch specials
4
Came back here again for another visit recently, again to try the set lunch. This time the main size was a little small but the quality of the food was still very decent. No issues getting a table at lunchtime without a reservation.
5
Fantastic spot for drinks and nibbles after work. Good wine menu and AMAZING cheese platters. You can also include some cold meats.
Lovely atmosphere with friendly staff and reasonable prices.
I had the stuffed chicken main, and I would highly recommend it.
3
Great location and friendly service let down by limited choices in main courses. Starting platter with cold cuts was good.
5
The Restaurant/Bar has excellent service staff. Despite the large crowd that turned up on Bastille Day, they were able to accommodate our needs swiftly and efficiently. Furthermore, the restaurant/Bar boasts a wide selection of French cheese that is sold at very competitive prices.
1
All the potential of being good. Spoiled by the complacent waitress and management team who offer service below the poor level generally found in Club Street.

It’s been around since 2012, but I only discovered O Batignolles recently when trying to escape the rowdy excesses of Club Street. I’ve been back several times since, thanks to the warm ambience, extensive wine list and good service. Food wise, expect classic French bistro fare of salads, tartines, and mains. They also offer a choice of platters all day long, where you can choose to mix yummy French cheeses with cold cuts, or if already drained by a week of decision making, you can let the kitchen choose for you. My last visit was Saturday 27 August, and the place was incredibly busy with only a couple of staff on hand to serve. Not that it mattered though, as Nora was one of them, and this is a lady who can seriously multi-task: she cleared tables, greeted and seated customers, took orders, served drinks and food, checked on her tables frequently - in fact it’s quite possible that on the rare occasions she wasn’t on the floor, she was in the kitchen rustling up some food or doing the dishes! As a plus, prices are reasonable, so next time you tire of fighting your way through the overcrowded, (and overhyped) bars on Club St, this is your place
5
I absolutely love their food and wine menu. Don't get me started on the cheese. It is extremely delicious and i cant wait to have another session of wine and cheese. Absolutely adore the ambience, great for any kind of occasion! Very helpful and friendly staff
4
I always enjoy my time there, for its food, great choices, good prices, and very professional and friendly service...However I have a small comment, after taking one of their menus few days ago, I thought the delicious soup was really too small to even enjoy, it was a bit shocking to be served the equivalent of 2 or 3 tablespoons onl
3
We came here after reading good reviews but we did not find the food deserving of the good reviews. Firstly the portion served for the set lunches which cost 25++ were quite small. The so called duck confit was actually shredded duck meat buried under a bed of mashed potato. It wasn't the drumstick. For 25++ the shredded meat didn't meet my expectations. It was also quite warm as it was open air. On a hot sunny day this is NOT the place to come for lunch. It was quite empty when we were there probably because people preferred cooler placed. Dinner should be better but be prepared for the humidity. Compared to so many other bistrots in Singapore I would not come back here as there are better alternatives elsewhere.
5
As if we were in France. The food was great and rich in flavours. We had three different dishes of the day and they were extraordinary. The atmosphere is very lively and the staff is very kind and attentive. I look forward to come again

My wife and I had a very remarkable experience at this French wine bar. We did not just like the food, we loved them. Thumbs up to their chef/cook. They were the grilled salmon steak and the grilled chicken stuffed with mushroom. The taste was really amazing we wished to have ordered more. These were suggested by a lady named Maricar. Her smile and service was awesome, we felt so special that night. We were also served by a more petite lady named Nora. Her smile and pleasant approach made me ordered a bottle of red wine La Duchesse Sancerre as per her recommendation which my wife and I loved too. We even brought the leftover back home to our hotel. Although that time was quite busy as more and more guests are coming in, in groups, as it was a Friday night, these ladies were able to serve us with superb quality, indeed a real customer service. This made our visit in Singapore more pleasant and memorable. Our utmost thanks and salute to the staff and management of O'Batignolles
4
Spent last nite her with abt 10 of my friends! Such a great spot on Club street if u are looking for good food and drink! Girls nite promo includes one bottle of prosecco for every 4 girls at a table -FREE! We ordered some food to share of which the cheese platter and the quiche were a favorite! Will recocommend especially for a relaxed evening of drinks with friends!
5
O'Batignolles is the perfect place to spend a quality time with your friends, family or better half. We visit this beautiful place almost every weekend to have nice brunch or romantic dinner. There is cozy chilling atmosphere, nice music and tasty food. In one minute you are carried away to the beautiful french street, somewhere in Paris - and you don't even need to take a plane to feel yourself in romantic France .  I can recommend this amazing place with pleasure to people who want to spend their time easy and lovely. The food and drinks are very delicious, also there is a nice collection of vine. The service is fast and accurate, very affable and nice. The atmosphere is great here!
4
Situated in a comfy corner of Club Street, this place is cozy and has good atmosphere.We only had a bottle of wine cuz we just had a meal before. Service could be better. The waiters/waitresses are not very easy to find.A well spent afternoon
5
It was a amazing experienced which make my Sunday dinner wow. an Indian staff who greeted us when we entered in the restaurant n follow by a excellent n fast service by him.We came here first time n the ways he suggest us about the wines and food was really impressive. And the wines was great and we had the mixer of cheese and salmon plus burger was superb.Great service will be back soon with more friends
5
Came here for Sunday brunch. The restaurants offers a full brunch with sweets and savouries to choose from, or a la carte options. This time I tried the full brunch, however in the past I also tasted some of their a la carte dishes which were equally delicious. Unique to their brunch are the unlimited croissants, and as a guest you are lucky they offer them unlimited because they are some of the best croissants you will ever come across. Next to my eggs benedict and french toast I had about 4 croissants, they were just amazing. The staff are very friendly too, and the locations is great being in the picturesque area of Club Street
4
Came here for lunch recently and opted for the 3 course set lunch for $25++. This consisted of a soup (which was served a little too hot, but was still quite tasty), a main course (roast chicken which was decent, although only a very limited selection included in the set lunch options), and a dessert (chocolate brownie, very good). Coffee or tea was also included: I had a cappuccino which was also quite good. I would definitely come back here
4
Tried to book a table for four, but was told that if we just turn up we would get a free bottle of wine. Decided not to book, and found a squishy table on arrival. Once seated, the details emerged that it was only if it was four women.... Sign....Two couples don't get the deal.....The service was awkward, and we found it difficult to understand their English.The cheese & meat starter platter was yummy, and the salmon was good, despite being a little overcooked.Watch out for the smokers, that light up next to you eating dinner......
4
My family and I love this place, especially for its sunday breakfast.... truly good experience relaxing, good food and very friendly waiters...However I have just a small complain which explain that I gave 4 stars and not 5: when having their famous breakfast menu, it would seem normal and fair to the client that it's free flow of Coffee/Tea.... we all know that it's not an heavy cost for the Bistrot, however it's annoying for the customer and seem a bit "cheap and stingy"
5
Parisian spirit in Singapore with great selection of wine and food. Perfect host for our charity event with excellent and personal service.
4
Food there was great. All ingredients were fresh and paired wonderfully. Service was excellent as much attention was given to us throughout our entire meal.
5
Great food and great service. True to French bistro traditions. Good wine and cheese selections. Knowledgeable staff. The salmon was perfectly cooked and presented. Great atmosphere and perfect location.
3
overall was great except when I helped my friend to enquire for beer promotions, I think the person behind the bar for irritated and answered, "no, this is a wine bar..." - I felt silly for a minute.. otherwise, it was a nice&quiet weekend late afternoon. wine is cheap&good all day paired with fun charcuterie selections. we were lucky that we got seated indoor, but near outdoor on a breezy overcast day
4
Had lunch there with a friend recently. There's some Ã  la carte possibilities with focus on French food. The salad and quiche lorraine we had was very good, maybe a bit light in portion but still very nice. We also had tiramisu which was very very small but very good nonetheless. The staff is a bit pushy because they came to ask us maybe 5-6 times if we wanted sparkling water, other alcoholic beverages, and so forth. The lunch menu (set menu) looked good as well and good price/quality. All in all it's a good place to have a snack, not for a really heavy meal. The alcohol is also not very expensive to Singapore standards. And after-work drinks can be very crowded here as well as it's just at the beginning of Club Street. Nice location, nice snack foods and alcohol, so why not go there again?
4
We had a good time at O Batignolles, service was friendly and not too slow. Food is good, I recommend taking a cold cuts/cheese platter as starter with a glass of wine... I am French and I enjoyed the French food there. My only surprise was to discover the dessert menu, which has a selection of only 4 choices, and none of them is French! Being a huge fan of desserts, that left me a bit disappointed.Note that the windows and doors are fully opened, so it can get a bit hot inside although the air con is turned ON
5
What a great place! We were able to get a table as a walk in. Wine is reasonably priced. Ordered a variety of cheese, salad with bread+cheese and a croque Monsieur. We asked the server if they could cut the sandwich for us to share. And that they did with toothpicks in each piece. Fun atmosphere and great service.
5
Came down with friends and had wines with platters. The platter was very good as we can choose the cheeses from the list. Wines are value for money and the service is attentive but not intrusive. Very welcoming staff and knowledgeable. He informed me about the up coming wine tasting. Will booked it with my friends
4
I have eaten here three times recently. That probably says it all. Certainly at lunch time the S$18++ set menu is excellent value (soup/quiche & salad/mini dessert/coffee), with everything very nicely cooked and presented. The service is friendly and efficient. I would certainly recommend making a reservation as each time I've visited the restaurant has been full
4
Club Street is full of inviting eating places but we did not want a large meal so we were welcomed into the French Bistro on the corner.We were served by Nora who was delightful and we had Caesar salad and Quiche Lorainne.Both were delicious.We finished with a selection of three cheeses,in excellent condition,with lovely crisp,warm bread.This is an atmospheric venue to which we would hasten to return
5
The location of this little restaurant is perfect for a night out with close friends or a date. Food's good and the variety of affordable wines are great. The service staff are friendly and helpful too!
4
- Nice French-style bistro off Club St
- Good selection of wines, does promotions and tastings every now and then.
5
Great little place on the end of Club Street. The breakfast was delicious and the atmosphere was lovely. Very quaint. Would definitely recommend for breakfast / brunch. The poached eggs were perfection.
3
Lacklustre, warm, poor air circulation. dried eggs cocotte and tasteless French toast. Food does not taste French in general. Better for reasonably priced alcohol.
5
Perfect location for a casual alumni network meet up, good deals on French wines and food platters, excellent service and friendly staff!
4
The service was impeccable and the ambience was laidback and perfect for my valentine's day. I had the brunch set consisting of egg pacifico, french toast and free flow chocolate basket. I was actually heading there for the free flow croissants but they were all sold out when I reached so I was a bit disappointed. Nonetheless, I am satisfied with the rest of the food and also thankful for CHOPE as it made my reservation hassle-free and convenient
3
Came here for dinner, most of the places nearby were still closed for Chinese New Year. The food was quite average and some dishes were underseasoned and lackluster. We shared the salmon starter which comprised of salmon in toast (essentially), a bland rillete and a cucumber shrimp salad that agaib lacked taste.We shared the beef burger. The patty had no appreciable seasoning.The suggested wine pairing with the burger was nice and reasonably priced too.Service was ok though they were probably understaffed.Overall, not a place I'd go to for dinner. Plenty of better options in the area. Brunch may be a different experience based on the reviews I've read
4
My husband and I were looking for a casual place for Saturday dinner in the Club Street area and O Batignolles appeared on our Entertainer app, so we decided to try it out.We had a nice table waiting for us, good wine selection and tasty food. The creme brûlée was the best we have had anywhere!The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. We will definitely return
4
Great to visit whilst on a trip from Jakarta - relaxed atmosphere and good wine list.Visited twice (Fri & Sun) whilst here, kitchen closed early (7pm) on sunday, and bar was also shutting early at 8 so sadly was deprived a second glass of Pouilly Fuse (first world problem I know).Will be back next time I'm in town.
1
I guess you need to be French and a friend of the owner to be welcomed properly. We grabbed a table outside and the owner stopped us very aggressively saying it was actually booked (nothing on it though). I was about to leave so he said we can have the next available one... We moved to the next available one and have also been sent back to our seat... Because it has finally been given to a friend of the owner. I paid my bill (expensive for a small glass of "piquette") and left "sans demander mon reste". Welcomed like in a bad parisian café..
5
I spent 15 years in Paris and I can say O Batignolles is very good. Happy I found my Brunch place as I was doing in France. Next will be dinner.
4
Went there for a quick lunch. Loved the ambience, the fresh juice and the steak. Very nice all in all. Didn´t quite have the time to really appreciate it, but the food was good and that´s the main thing.
5
We ate there two times during our visit for lunch. Great authentic French food. Fast service. Very reasonable open wine prices and selection. Fast service. We enjoyed the outdoor seating.
4
As we went for lunch, we chose Executive set.It was hot and humid. So we sat inside.Service was good.Food came promptly.We had brownies as dessert.Overall, a decent place.
5
O batignolles is a very nice French restaurant. The cheese is good, the wine selection is great and their brunch amazing. Thanks O batignolles
5
We were headed to the usual suspects at club street when we found this place at one end of the street and am so Glad we did. The wine was good and very inexpensive by SG standards. We also had the smaller version of the cheese platter which was delicious and "more than good" for two. Made us wonder how large the big one would've been. The cheese and breads were wonderful. The ambience isn't fancy but this place will deliver you a nice relaxed French evening
3
I came here before during the week and it was fine , nice food , good service ... Today was a different story , had to ask for the table to be cleaned after that the waiter already took our order and should have seen that the tables was dirty when we arrived , needed to actually stand up and go inside to ask to order and a second time to ask for the bill (only 3 tables of clients so not that the waiter was overwhelmed) . And no bread on the table which was one of the thing I appreciated last time. Let's say that the previous experiences were better
3
Popped in for dinner, but on Sundays the chef is at home. Platters are menu de jour, or soir/nuit, so tasting plates that are modestly priced, but nothing substantial. Wine list is good and fairly priced for Singapore, but lacking that 'je ne sais quoi'. However, inoffensive, but not deserving of its high ranking
5
Cute little wine bar in a trendy street. The ambiance makes you really feel like in Paris. We had a couples of their wine by the glass and shared a yummy cheese-cold cuts platter. The wine selection is really nice and affordable. Their staff informed us that we could buy it to take it home at even cheaper price
5
We always liked this place whilst still living in Singapore - good vibe and definitely best price/quality wines in Singapore. We did our pre wedding drinks here for our overseas guests and it was a blast. Staff friendly and consistent quality, also that day. Highly recommended if you fancy good french wines when visiting or living in Singapore. My wife to be at the time was a happy woman - so was I. :)

Good spot that the beginning of Club Street, for an after-work drink session on the terrace, see the early nightlife starting and passage. Good snacks french stype, and relatively cheap wines by the glass and bottle (they do retail too).

Went there with the family of 2 kids... Very relaxed, great place both inside and outside... But not a place to let the kids run around. Foot was really good and both kids finished off all they were served.

After a long walk from the Marina Bay Area, this looks like a little oasis for us to refresh and ease the thirst.

Very nice restaurante in a new up and coming dining area in Singapore. Though not too old the french atmosphere is there. Good good and nice environment. The cheese platter is highly recommended.
5
A typical French bistro that seems to be patronized by the French community (including myself). Classic bistro food. Nothing fancy but everything is just right. Including the wine and the service. I think I will come back (thank you to Ling)

Visited for Ssaturday brunch combined with baby shower. The staff were so accommodating and friendly and the set brunch of croissants, butter and jam, pains au chocolat, followed by a wide array of egg dishes with or without champagne option was so nice and familiar. Everything was just as you would expect in a Parisian bistro except for the coffee, which surpassed expectations.Would love to return for supper

I had lunch with a friend at O' Batignolles and I was very impressed. The place was sold out so we stood at the counter for a good half hour drinking iced water and chatting before our table was ready. But the meal was worth the wait - the tomato soup was fresh and tasty just like the sort my wife makes from scratch at home, then the salads as main courses were large and delicious. I had the goats cheese salad which was gorgeous, with crisp, thin toasts topped with melted mature cheese rondels. My friend had the generous sea food salad with avocado.We closed with a taster dessert platter and coffee. The carrot cake was moist and tasty and complimented the fresh mango. Our waitress was friendly and swift, the ambiance was like being in a relaxed cafe in France. The wine list is extensive, and compared to some of the neighbouring joints O Batignolles is great value. It serves what you expect of a classic French bistro.

Don't expect too much and you will have a nice meal at O Batignolles. Cheese board is decent, and ask which wine to pair it with. Wine is quite cheap for Singapore standards, so this is a regular with our girlie catch-up dates. Croque Moiseur is to die for - mouth watering! Ladies night also a great deal - 4 girls = one free bottle of fizz
5
This restaurant always impresses. Great service, fresh French food and a very reasonable set lunch with soup, main/salad, dessert and tea or coffee. A perfect corner of Paris in the CBD of Singapore - and a perfect place for business meetings. Also a fun place for an evening pint too
4
Great wine by the glass at affordable price (8 S$ for Ugni Blanc Colombar blend). On Club street corner and ideal for people watching. Very friendly staff. Small and simple menu but good quality ingredients. We had Charcuterie and bread with the wine Not so touristy and I can recommend highly
5
I love this little place on the corner of Club street. The food is simple, but good, so is the coffee and the wine by the glass. There is wifi and one can sit at the tables outside in the afternoon, just like in Paris.
5
Really nice ambiance, professional staff, appropriate music and moreover delicious authentic french "charcuterie" and cheese, outstanding bread, reasonable price. I can just recommend this place, whether you are French or not :)

About the 3rd time or so I've been for the brunch. It's a nice change to the hotel buffet mania with a good balance of good food and of course, champagne. Service was a bit off this time and slower than expected.
4
Went to o batignolles for Sunday brunch. Very good food and excellent service. Fairly small restaurant located on a corner in downtown Singapore. Enjoyed this very much. Would recommend it to my friends.
4
This place feels like a true french bar.I frequent here regularly with my girl friends for mid week socials. We always order the sharing platters because we love the selection of meats and cheeses.I've also been here on a ladies night with the offer for cheap bubbles and seem to remember it was a good deal. The only criticism I have with the service is that I find one particular french waitress/manager quite arrogant/unhelpful and have experienced this on most occasions. However it doesn't put me off coming back!

Weekend brunch (11-3?) is excellent. All you can eat croissants (the very best in town!), chocolate croissants or outstanding french toast, very nice eggs benedict, orange juice and coffee or tea. Setting is very pleasant with seating outside. Charming street. Place is let down, however, by poor service. Of course, it is both Singapore and French, so you are getting the worst of both worlds
5
If you miss France or if you want to have a real taste of what an everyday bistrot atmosphere is, this is the place!The food is similar to what you would get in France for a very decent price compared to some other fancy French places. You have the weaved chairs, the stone tables, the decoration and the service. Waiters who can actually advise on wine, are polite, nice and funny always open to arrange...I can't recommend this place enough

Saturday night dinner with my boyfriend, we were looking forward to a relaxed evening with great cheese and wine, music and atmosphere...some of these were excellent, some not so much. The service wasn't as good as I had expected, they couldn't find the reservation so I had to find the email and show them even though they had empty tables. Then as we were just finishing our starter of cheese and meat platter with bread - which was delicious and I would have again for sure - they brought up our mains before they had even taken the starter plates away, which caused problems for the waiters and our tiny table. So we had finished both courses within 40 minutes of arriving! Not quite what we had hoped for. Of course next time we will ask for a delay between courses but we shouldn't have to. The red wine was the best we've had in Singapore so far (in 3 months). The other thing worth mentioning is that the menu for main courses is extremely small with only about 5 options so I wouldn't make it a regular place for dinner.I would return though and recommend it, next time just for cheese and wine

Very cute Parisian cafe on a popular corner of Gemmil Lane near Club Street. On Wednesdays (Ladies Nights) it's overflowing with people (mostly French-speakers) and groups of 4 or more ladies get a free bottle of champagne which is a great perk. It's a lovely, hectic and authentic-feeling place
5
The first time I went to ô Batignolles, a group of girlfriends and I decided we needed a catch up so headed to their ladies night. On arrival we were promptly seated and given a bottle of free champagne- what more could a girl want?! To stop the bubbles going to our heads we ordered the mixed cold cuts and cheese planchette, which was excellent quality. I had such a good time - very casual and lively atmosphere - that I went back a few weeks later for brunch which was equally as enjoyable. Again there was lots of champagne (can you see why it’s quickly becoming my favourite place?!), the food was yummy and from what I could make out with my rusty language skills, there seemed to be a lot of French people there, which in my opinion makes it very authentic indeed

Located in cool club st this cute cafe is great for a light lunch the la mer salad with shrimps, avocado and grapefruit was yum!
4
Nice hangout place for groups / friends. even a casual catch up over a drink with a known biz associate possible
The staff know what they are serving and can recommend good food with the drinks
5
Its located in a great spot, the have Good service, nice place, i like to go on wensdays with my friends, always a good time.

nice cold cuts and french chees along with a vast choice of french wines at an affordable price....
whatever is not easy to find in singapore :)
5
Just enjoyed a quick lunch in this cute little French cafe. An excellent eggs benedict, and a tasty goats cheese salad. Glass of champagne, fresh orange and a bottle of Badoit. All that, plus friendly staff and a nice location at the bottom of Club Street, all for sixty bucks.We'll be back for sure
4
My teenage daughter and I enjoyed a light lunch which basically consisted of salad which was delicious.An oversight on my part as there was nothing more substantial on the menu. Water was offered, but again an oversight as I accepted and it was bottled and expensive.Service was good and waiters were friendly
5
The atmosphere of this place brings you back to the French cafÃ©s in Paris in the 50s. Food was good, the wine list is also good. The owner works in the premises which is why everything is running smoothly and peacefully. A good place for dinner and brunch
1
Wednesday night = ladies night = no reservation ! OK but when we arrived they didn't care about us. We had to ask for a drink menu, ask for ordering the drinks etcThe service was really really bad. We waited for more than 1.30 hour. And get a table of 2 although we were 4. The service is really bad, there is no organization at all so some people who arrived later could be able to have a table before us... So food was not so bad

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfat.comA revamped brunch menu now includes a decadent Champagne and Croissants brunch (yes croissants) served only on weekends from 11am to 4pm. For $89, this includes free flow bubbly and croissants, along with coffee/tea, freshly squeezed orange juice (we saw them bring in oranges), a choice of bread (4 option) and a choice of eggs (4 options). If you're not up for that, there's also the $29 brunch set which excludes the free flow champagne and croissants. Sandwiches and other brunch items are also available on the a la carte menu. From the bread section, we had the blueberry pancakes and the bread basket. The pancakes were horrible and made us conclude that we should never order anything that isn't French at a French place. They were hard and dry and despite soaking them in the maple-ish syrup (i don't think it's real maple), it weren't enough to moisten the dough. MEH. Should have gone for the Brioche with Nutella or French Toast.That said, the bread basket was fabulous. The croissant and the chocolate pain are deliciously buttery. Just look at the gloss on the pastry skin! Layers and layers of thin crisp goodness that peels and crackles away to reveal the moist, chewy and savory center. No additional butter required though butter is always lovely on croissants. One of the better croissants around Singapore. No kidding. Now i understand why they would have a Champagne and Croissant brunch. It was impossible to stop at just 1!The croissants are available for takeaway. If i didn't remember wrongly, each small little baby costs $1.50. A little on the pricey side but they are too good to be missed. They certainly evoked deep wanderlust for France.We had the Eggs Benedict and Eggs Pacifico, one with parma ham and the other with smoked salmon. I wasn't wowed by the eggs, they were adequate but again nothing mind blowing. A richer hollandaise sauce would have made the difference. The muffins used were quite good however.I would make a trip back to O Batignolles for their out-of-this-world croissants but i'll never do their brunch sets again. Pick from their selection of sandwiches instead. The croque monsieur from the next table looked rather fab and their salads sounds really good too

Set up and run by a French man in september 2012, it is a nice restaurant to stop at with french flavor both in terms of deco setting and also its menu.it is not far from the busy business district, on the way to Chinatown. French food has the reputation of being expensive. this place serves at very normal prices and all typical classic french dishes around S$20. good french cheese plate, and also good wines at very reasonable price (S$7-8 per glass). A buz place in the evening for drinking. Many french expats or on the way home business persons but also groups of friends around 22h.the brunch is nice and worth your money. If you fancy champagne so early, you can have your brunch with free flow of champagne at S$89. it is served on weekends from 11h-15h30for those who want to have a last stop over before entering the chinatown area with its touristy restaurants, it is a nice stop to have a good coffee or fresh generous size salad to rest, and get ready your next part of your day tour.it is a good size restaurant but it is not very big either; if you really want to go you may wish to pre book a table especially for the brunch.for drinks, in the evening side road standing tables will allow you to make it with few friends even if packed

We came here on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Great staff were great, very fun but professional (even though we may have been a bit noisy). Wine reasonably priced (for over priced Singapore), good location.
5
After driving by here in a taxi, I decided to go back and try this eatery. We were not disappointed. My husband and I shared a cheese platter with a bottle of wine sitting outside, just like Paris! To add to the atmosphere, the waiter was French. We took friends back a couple of weeks later, and they enjoyed their experience as well

With a very limited menu, this lovely little place at the beginning of Club Street is perfect if you want to collect your dinner party. Nice and well priced French wines accompanied by great charcuterie and cheese mean you're not wanting there. Attentive service here but with tasting notes on bottles you won't need their help picking your poison. For dinner you really need to walk up into the smorgasbord that is club street but hey that's right there.

I visited here with friends and although a fun ambience - well very loud french music to shout over - it is not a place for dinner. It is good for lunch or nibbles and drinks. The menu is very limited with croque monsieur and quiche and salads which are not great for dinner options. For a french restaurant there are no pates, no snails, no french onion soup, no steak, no coq au van, no beef bourginon, no french fries whatsoever, no side dishes (french beans etc) the list could continue. The very limited main courses they do have (there are five and two of which are pasta?!) are tiny. We all left starving. We did drink good wine and I did enjoy the meat and cheese platter we shared to start so I would go back purely to have that and then go for dinner at one of the other great restaurants in Club Street. The place would be great if they sorted out there menu and actually gave you decent size servings and a real choice of options

A bit of Paris in Singapore.... what else !It is my favortie place in Singapore for having drinks with my friends. The place is nice, the interior design is fancy and the owners are super lovely. The wine and champagne are really good (not causing any headache the day after) and the prices are really attractive for Singapore. I haver never been disappointed about the service & the quality. It is definitely a must to go ..

Great little place, good drinks and food.Slightly over-priced, but you have to pay a premium for the great location. As I'm sure their rent is nuts.It's a great place for a drink and a snack but not so great for main meals. The menu is very limited, and the mains aren't satisfying. (For example, Steak served with just green beans, no fries or other carbs.)The platters are great. Good quality and quantity. And very good coffee.Free Wifi has made this place my 2nd office for a while

This is a wonderful corner site cafe oozing atmosphere. Wine is great and well priced in a country that hosts mostly big new world brands with equally big price tags and alcohol content. O'Bats however falls down on service and food but even with that hugely in its disfavor it is definitely a place to visit. I wonder if owners expected such success maybe this accounts for their being understaffed and having poorly trained staff. Nevertheless staff are lovely and naievely helpful if in need of a lot more training. So staff issues forgivable but whats less forgivable is the very poor standard of food. Several cold glatenous beef dishes have been served as well as lasagna with poorly mixed flour sauces , this unfortunately makes for a pretty disgusting after taste which is a great pity with such a good concept as O batignollesCold potatoes gratin are equally not acceptable . Other than cold cuts its hard to pick a winner from this menu.I do so hope the owners read this and tweak the food and service, they have a super place here

Sitting outside in the evening, tasting the excellent meat, the cheese, the Quiche Lorraine or the goat cheese with a glass (or two) of good wine, and it really feels like you are back in some bistrot in some street in France. Interesting how a bit of genuine, good tasting food in a casual setting can transport you so far away
5
Good food, good service, good coffee, nice airy cafe. Great place for lunch in Club Street where there are so many places to try. Face tissues in the toilet to dry your hands is a bit strange but that's the only negative for this lovely little French place

Went to this restaurant with a former colleague as neither of us were really overly hungry but felt more like a glass of good wine with a plater.Had a very nice French red wine and a mixed cheese and charcuterie platter. Initially when the serve came my first thoughts were that it was a bit small but have to say this was merely due to the size of the platter itself.Both of us were full and the taste was wonderful.Service was great and very welcomingCan highly recommend this plac
