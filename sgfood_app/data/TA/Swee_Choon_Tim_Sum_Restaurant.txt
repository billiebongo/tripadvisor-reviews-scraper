4 stars for Taste, 3 stars for Value & Ambience, 5 stars for the thoughtful and friendly services. Lunch menu is limited compared to dinner menu.
5
as usual good service provided, fresh and hot food from kitchen, and quick service tendered. will come again.
5
No frills dim sum in Jalan Besar area. Efficient service and good food quality. Love the fried mee sua.
4
I ordered black paper prok rib, prawn dumpling, siew mai and carrot cake. The food is authentic and well prepared, service is fast and enviroment is ok. But now they start charging service fee which is not good.
3
This place serves good tim sum and is open till late in the evening. Good for supper place. Must try their siew mai and chicken feet.
5
sweechoon is LEGENDARY
i eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. it is bombz go if u havent tried it you're missing out life.
4
When we arrived at this restaurant around 9:30 PM, the line at this restaurant was really long and we must have waited at least 45 minutes. They practically ran out to space inside, so we were seated outside in the back yard which had about 10 tables. We ordered about 15 portions of a variety of dim sum for the 3 of us. Everything tasted so fresh and good, especially the shrimp dumplings which had big scrumptious shrimps. You must try this one
3
The dim sum is quite good in terms of taste and pricing for Singapore area. They got massive selection menu. You can get Shanghai and Hong Kong dim sum in the restaurant. The queue line is quite long and i don't recommend it if you are in a rush
4
We just wanted a snack and enjoyed a spring roll and custard tart to go. Then realised that the place occupies the whole block and you can have sit down dim sum etc as well. Sadly we didnâ€™t get to go back but it was obviously popular with the locals.
3
Meal: 3.5/5 (out of five)Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (out of five)Service: 4/5 (out of five)Summary: A good place to have supper with friends after midnight. Food variety is good, service is quick and prompt, pricing range mid to low.Note: This place is closed every tuesda
4
I ordered big bao, prok rib, prawn dumpling and carrot cake. All food is authentic and well prepared, service is fast and enviroment is ok.
4
The food was good but portion was small. The fried mee snua was delicious. Service was prompt and pleasant in an old world sense. Despite reservation, there was no actual reservation system - more like first come, first served.
5
Enjoyed my trip there. The menu looks really sumptuous. Simple but really great food. The servings/portions were really generous despite the affordable price. Atmosphere was “old school” but sound and smell were well ventilated. :)
5
The food here is highly recommended for Dimsum lover like me. I honestly enjoyed the food. Even though we wait for about 30-45 mins. It’s worth the wait! My favourite are Mee-Suah kueh, Pan fried Pork Dumpling and Siew Mai.
4
The place is no frills and simple. And the food is great, offering a good spread of Tim Sum, noodles and others. Really liked the Fan Choy and Siew Mai
3
This tim sum restaurant captures the mass market by the big varieties of tim sum provided for selection as well as reasonable pricing. Hope they can improve tim sum quality and service so as to make it more value for money.
5
The service crew was good in handling huge crowd. I'm not sure why they assign 2 persons to a big table anyway but I'm fine with it. Food is good as usual. Will return again.
4
Those night owls can come here for DimSum during odd hours. Nice food here, just that the place is quite cramp and noisy. Pricing also a bit high compare to others.
3
Foods wasn’t fantastic for the price. Service was average. Was noisy in the restaurant. Don’t think will visit again
4
A very popular dim sum restaurant on Jalan Basar with a numbered queuing system displayed on a digital screen outside. They will also call your mobile when your table is ready. Prices are reasonable by Singapore standards and attract a predominantly younger crowd. We found the dim sum to be good but not outstanding. The restaurant stays open until 6am for night owl dim sum lovers
4
Arrived there around 11 pm and there is still queue and we wait around 15 mins and our table was ready. The food itself was great and it is value for money. Recommended for after hours food.
5
Food is serve timely, service staff friendly, Ordering of food is very simple and fast. Will recommend to others friend and colleague .Thumb up.
4
Very popular with local people for dinner or late night supper. Selling tasty dim sum , Zi char dishes and porridge.Prepare to wait and long queue sometime.
4
The place to go to for dim sum at all times especially for lunch or supper.
Parking is further away and need to walk a distance
Otherwise the range is extensive and value for money
3
Can always depend on sweechoon for a sudden dimsum fix since it's open till late & has a wide variety. Service is prompt.
4
I love the food there. So many variety, affordable pricing and it taste good. But the problem is sometimes, there can be a lack of seating. But come on, good food are worth the wait.And the best part is, it is opened till very late. So late-night supper goers, you know where to go
5
Yum dim sum - XLB and the spicy wanton with Chilli oil . Carrot cake was ok. Lucky to get a table immediately as the crowds came in . Nice to sit outdoor near the side lane - quieter and good place to soak in the local atmosphere . Great value for money restaurant. Likely to come back.
5
Not a fancy dinner place but one that offers you delicious local fare that can't be found anywhere else. Brave the Q on the weekend evenings/nights or swing by during the mid-week to share plates with family and friendsExtensive menu to satisfy every craving from savoury to sweet, and if you can't fit everything in there is always a take-away selection! And seriously be tempted and grab some home.

@TheKuoKnowsStuck for somewhere to eat in the early hours of the morning? Have no fear. Swee Choon on Jalan Besar is there to the rescue.But be prepared to queue. This place is, probably, the worst-kept secret in Singapore, especially amongst young diners who descend on the place in droves.Thankfully the electronic queuing system works a treat.Swee Choon serves the full complement of Dim Sum items. The Char Siu Bao is hot and fluffy. The Cheong Fun is meaty and fulsome. But it’s not just about the Chinese delicacies...........The selection of cook-and-fry items are definitely worth trying. The Sea Spice Aubergibes is beyond delicious. So too are the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops.And just one more thing. Swee Choon is ridiculously cheap. It doesn’t take credit cards. But who needs a flexible friend, when a meal for four comes to less than $40
4
This place been doing dim sum since 1962, so they must have got it right! A mere 8 minutes walk from Tyrwhitt Road, famous with the locals. Opened day and night (used to be night time only). Always long queue at the front of shop.So, as tourists, one night we gave it a try after a shopping session at Mustafa Centre. We got there around 7pm, already queue started to form albeit a short one.How to book a table? Here where technology took over: book via iPad at the front of shop! follow the iPad instructions and they will send you via sms, your booking number. When you got the sms, then the staff would show you your allocated table, then gave them your order sheet. Food arrived very quickly too and DELICIOUS!Will come again for the food and its very fascinating booking system via iPad, nothing like this in Perth! ha ha
5
The small serving portions of dim sum (and corresponding cheaper prices) meant my table of 4 could enjoy a huge variety of dishes and re-order what we liked! Waiters were quick to attend to us too. Cheers!
5
Swee Choon is still good as before! Love their liu sha bao, siew mai,har gao, egg tart and XLB! Would still continue to come here for a dim sum fix :D
5
Dim sum place with local atmosphere.
Open from lunch to midnight supper.
Have to wait but the taste is great. Reasonable price. Love Mee-Suan Kueh!
ローカルの点心レストラン。席数は多いが、夕食どきは10分以上待つ。ここの焼き餃子はジューシーで美味しい。看板商品のMee-Suan Kueh(そうめんを練りこんだ焼きもち)も是非試してほしい。
5
food was good value for money, abt 20 per pax. recommend their egg tarts! long operating hours so can late night supper
3
Traditional dim sum place with always long queue during dinner time. Overall dim sim consider average to me, if no queue required, i will be dine in else i will give a miss. The price is average, not expensive in general.
4
Spilling onto the front pavement, scattered through two or three adjoining shops and finding even more space out the back, in the alleyways off Syed Alwi tables are packed with late night dim sum lovers, drunk, loud, and blissfully happy. There is a huge selection at Swee Choon, and in the small hours when you’re not quite ready to go home, they’re all fantastic.Wash it all down with a sweet lime juice - beer isn’t allowed late night in this dry part of town - and it’s the perfect late night feast. I hear they’re good at a more sensible dining hour too, but that just doesn’t sound like so much fun does it?
1
I had been to swee choon many years back. The food has always tasted average to me. This time when i got there, it got worse. The staff seems keen to turnover the table even when i have pending orders not served. Just bcos business is good doesnt mean service should be neglecte
3
The dim sums were very average. As we were there on a Sunday afternoon, the queue was insane. We waited for around 35 mins for 2 pax. Despite the crowd, staff were very polite and friendly.If you are craving for Dim Sum but do not wish to pay a hefty price to it, I would recommend this place
4
Due to the increasing rental overheads and difficulty in hiring manpower, I must say this is one of the rare few that is well run, combining both physical manpower and advanced technology in the queuing system.I've noticed it's easier and quicker to get a table with just 2-3 pax but a long wait for anything larger in the group.The food items are out of this world. We have tasted some very authentic dim sum and freshly made.We were escorted to the back alley seating but that only adds color to the dining experience. Most locals would shun them under the heat but we simply adore it.Will highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a feel of the local dining without much exaggeration under any influence of marketing strategy.Will certainly return
3
I went there with my buddies there yesterday. It was crowded, located quite a distance to walk from Farrer MRT about 15 mins. Traditional old fashion Tim sum cuisine. Portion very small although the prices not expensive. Food was average only. But you like to try the very traditional style and type of Tim sum, you can give it a try. Dishes not refined. We ordered 6 tim sum bill was $43
4
Great food especially the salted egg yolk bun. Only thing is the price is SLIGHTLY expensive. The place also have a latge variety of dim sum that you can choose from.
4
Nice dim cums with many varieties. However the fishskin is not very worth it. Feels likes they just sprinkle the pepper salt onto pre bought fish skin
4
The price of the food are reasonably priced. There is a huge variety to choose from and the food is still as delicious!
5
It was not as crowded as expected at the time of visit few minutes before midnight.
Three of us dine-in and filled and paid less than a hundred dollars including drinks.
4
never fail to enjoy the food here. would love to bring my family here to try! maybe good if they could do delivery!
4
Made reservation for 11.45am. Reached earlier around 11am and there was already a long queue. Had to wait till around 11.35am for our table. Items were served fast. Prices were reasonable. 5 adults 1 kid bill added up to $85.
5
Great place to dine with friends! Will definitely come back for more. Liu sha bao is a must try! 😍😍
4
Last weekend, decided to bring the children to eat at Swee Choon. The last time I was there was probably 8-10 years back. The setup was still the coffee shop with back alley sitting then ! The place is totally different now, with air conditionaing a large dinning area made up of a few ship houses.There is a wide range of choices of dim sum, and northern Chinese Xiao long Bao and La Mian. I am sure that the Xiao long Bao and la mian was not in the original menu (10 years back !) Prepare to wait to be seated during peak hours.Overall - > Food : Good. Value : GoodEnjoy 
4
We were recommended this restaurant by a taxi driver one day, so when we were craving some dim sum, we decided to try it out.There was a waiting line and we quickly figured out how to place our phone number on the waiting list and grabbed a menu and filled in the selections.We were seated relatively quickly and gave the waiter our order. The food started coming out and it was a good succession of dishes and not all at once. All the dishes that we ordered were very delicious and plentiful.We enjoyed this restaurant and we will return
3
The place was recommended by a friend in Singapore. It was very busy when we visit and had to wait 40 minutes in the outside (on a hot and sweaty day) before being seated. The food was not bad but the portions were quite small. Is it worth queuing up for this place? Probably not
5
the salted egg bun, siu mai, xiao long bao, zha jiang mian were all delicious!! I went at about 12pm and there wasn't any queue. The service was pretty fast and quick. I definitely had a good meal in there !
4
Good. Will be back again! No crowd during lunch hour, but aircon too strong which makes the food cold very fast.
5
The egg tarts were not really impressive this time round. Also, some items were not available during lunch (the restaurant usually opens from 6pm to 6am).
3
Average dim sum, pricey and not worthy for a re-visit. Still as crowded as before. Nothing much to add on.
5
Been here multiple times over the last two years and have loved 90% of their dishes. I've visited mostly after midnight but also went for lunch recently and could get a table for 4 quite fast.My must try items that are always amazing are their xiao long bao, cheong fan with prawn, crispy squid tentacles, har gow, prawn wrapped with beancurd skin, tofu and floss and black bean pork ribs.The items I recommend to skip is the cold chilli chicken, spring onion pancake (soft type) and spring rolls.The worth trying items are the hot and sour soup, steamed and pan fried dumplings and desserts like the egg tart, mango sago and coconut pudding.Definitely a fantastic place for fast, tasty, affordable dim sum in the evening, throughout the night and now for lunch as well! Good for a few or a big group
4
Nothing beats an authentic evening dinner and or late night supper at a local favourite This place offers outdoor and air conditioned seating, and expect huge crowds on the weekend! If you can plan your visit during the weekRecommendations Egg white puff with bean paste (it's like a donut but better), steamed and baked buns with pork, local stir fried beans, creamy egg tarts The list goes on ... if unsure one can always look at what the locals are ordering and take it from there Will be back again for sure!
5
Swee Choon Tim Sum Restaurant is a casual restaurant, good for meet-ups between friends who just want to have dim sum at wallet-friendly prices. The spread of the dim sum is great, as is the quality of the food. Open until the wee hours, it is a great place for supper! Do remember not to over-order!!!! (Because every item on the menu is so tempting
4
Loved the har gau with its juicy prawns and marginally thin skin. The scallion noodles was fragrant and value for money. We really loved the carrot cake which was crispy, peppered with bits of chinese ham and just simply divine. Do not come here expecting a high class dim sum restaurant where the waitresses will be pouring your tea for you or that your dim sum will come in pretty little plates. It is no frills but worth every penny you pay for.
4
This infamous dim sum restaurant offers a wide variety of dim sums. It is always packed of people, even in the late night, and we had to wait for around half an hour to get the table. Once you arrived, you can inform the waiter/go to the self-service machine to take the queue number, and you will be informed through your mobile number when your queue is getting near. The price is also affordable. You also do not have to worry whether you cannot get taxi on the way back as the street is quite busy. You can also take Grab/Uber to go home
4
Went there around 9:30pm n there was still a long queue, lucky it's just the two of us n we dont mind sittine on the outside table so we got a table about 10 minutes or so. As for the food, I really like the glutinous rice, baked bbq buns n har gow (very big piece of shrimp ). We also ordered the pork ribs with salt n pepper, the spicing was just nice for me. Service was fast and price was affordable
4
Long queue but fast & efficient service. You pay for what you get. Had a great time savouring plenty of variety.
4
Food was okay, better than average for some such as the egg tarts. The fried ones are a bit too oily.
4
As a Malaysian Chinese, i had tried many "Tim Sum" before, what i would say is, Swee Choon have many Signature Tim Sum that i couldn't get at others Tim Sum Restaurants.
4
Great food at unbelievably affordable rates and fast service. Radish cake and the noodles always hit the spot
4
love the fried meesuakueh its a must order! its like my go to place for dim sum! and its quite near lavender mrt!
4
Friendly staffs. My most favourite in order as follows: fried fu zuk, chicken feet, shrimp dumpling / ha gao, Siew mai. $50 for 4 adults.
4
Having been here more than once, we are attracted to it's authentic local atmosphere, reasonable prices and very good food. Try the Szechuan dumplings, coconut pudding, pan fried dumplings, Xiao Long Pao, among many others. The ambience is fantastic as well and brings us back in time.
5
Eat here at least once a month. Does not break the bank. Bang for your buck. Worth every dime. The queue during dinner/supper peak hours are very long. But once you get a seat, food is served rather fast. Do not order too many at one go as dim sum is not as good when the food cools. Have it piping hot and you will have a blas
2
Overrated for Swee Choon!! Is our first visited so we tried almost all the thumbs up dishes on their menu but was really disappointed. The must order Mee-Suan Kueh is too hard, Siew Mai, Har Kow, carrot cake are on average level. The ginger slices provided with Xiao Long Bao could be thinner... The look of the Crispy Pork Rib w/pepper is unappealing.. dry, over fried and as expected, texture is tough. Dou maio is too salty... plain noodle in onion oil is like a dough of noodle when serve
5
came early at 645pm, lucky we did. the queue started to lengthen immediately after we got in. ordered a number of items, including the popular fried mee sua cake. portions were just right, not too much, and we were able to quickly wolf down the food plate after plate. we left quickly after finishing, walking around the perimeter, we were impressed at how large a sitting area, and still packed, it was. will come back again
3
Pleasant experience. Food was ok and kids enjoyed it. Affordable but could be cheaper. Coffee option was bizarre. Even the staff suggest I drink elsewhere!
4
Love the dim sum and prices are reasonable. Not many people around during lunch time so good place to have a nice relaxing lunch there.
5
Swee Choon food was the best! Went during lunch time and there were not as many people as they would have at night! So if you want to miss the crowd, go during lunchtime!
4
We had a delightful yum cha at Swee Choon today. The food was exceptional and the sambal chilli very good. Prices reasonable and it's open 24 hours!!
4
Mdm Chong was friendly and made the meal pleasant unlike usual "stone-face" staff. Quieter and more relax atmosphere compared to the evening crowd.
4
Good dim sum available almost anytime. Restaurant is spacious and air-conditioned. Wide variety of dim sum for everyone. I like their carrot cake and fried rice.
5
Wide range of variety dim sum, love the ambience. Each plate threw us a surprise, the mee sua kway tastes so nice.
4
Even though the experience wasn't that great, I've given them 4 stars. I had heard a lot about this place so I had to sample some of their food. And then the age old problem, the staff didn't speak English at all. They come and give you massive sheets and sheets of menu for you to choose and tick mark and pass it on to them. I ordered Pork soup, double fried golden pork and some steamed bun which was sweet. The soup was nice, fried pork was awesome, and the steamed bun wasn't to my liking.I would love to pay another visit with an absolutely empty stomach to sample more of their awesome food
4
Was quite crowded even on a rainy day. But the wait was not long. Need to get a queue number and queue. There will be an automatic phone call when your queue number is called. Remember to order their signature Fried Mee Sua, Yam fritters, baked char siew pastry etc. Price is reasonable and varieties are definitely more than restaurants. Parking maybe an issue though. Suggest grabbing a cab there.
3
5 of us went Swee Choon for lunch, parking was easy compared to nite time. The kou shui ji (spiced cold chicken) was so..good, custard bun also delicious. Ordered plain ramen which they la on the spot, v q and fresh. Besides these 3, I find the other dim sum average. We ordered red bean cake had clicked "serve together" but they missed out and gave us a refund. First time ate lunch at this place, it's a good experience. Caution: do not make wrong turn and get jam at city square mall
4
Dim sum is good. The fried rice is a little too dry. Staff's attitude can be improved. It would be great if the staffs are more attentive to the customers.
4
Great place to have Dim Sum, affordable prices at an historical environment.
Attitude of staffs is not at the best, but i guess its those dim sum restaurants cultural that you will see at many traditional shops.
4
Dim sum was good and the price was also reasonable. However location of the restaurant was a little inconvenient
5
Visited Swee Choon for lunch. Food was great and served piping hot. There wasnt a queue that day probably due to the heavy rain, but I also had a reservation, so no waiting was involved.
4
good food reasonable serving size, reasonable prizes and unpretentious no frills dining experience that's all about the food
4
They serve tim sum and zhi-char food. Food tastes good especially the Pain La Mian with Onion/Oil, Fried Custard Pumpkin, Prawn and Banana Fritter, Shanghai Xiao Long Pau, Red Bean Paste Pancake and Chicken Claw.Crowd starts to build up around 7.30pm onwards daily and continues to stream in till 2am on Fridays, weekends and PH eves. When you reach the restaurant, make the reservation via the electronic gadgets placed at the entrance. Choose both "outside and air-con seatings: option if you want to have your seats fast. A waiter will call for your reservation number and show you your seats. Have your food and pay at the cashier counter when you finished.Good place to try tim sum and Chinese food. Now they do open between 2-5pm for tea
4
Finally had a chance to patronised this restaurant. When we arrived at 8ish for dinner, there was queue we took the chance to wait; we took a queue number and stated the waiting time is about 45 minutes, but we had the place after 20minutes! The dim Sim are yummy. No service charge if you buy from the take away counter which is next to the restaurant.
1
Hi, chope allowed us to make a reservation for 22nd may but the shop was actually closed for renovations which lead me to making a wasted trip. Some coodination and communication would be good?? Surprised to find this happening in this time and day (where technology is so advanced) please improve on your services if not i suggest you close down. :)
5
I ate at Swee Choon as the first restaurant when I came to Singapore! It is situated very near the Little India and adds a really good food to the area. The dim sum is so good and is offered in a wide variety. Please try the Har Gow and Siew Mai above all. The vegetable dishes are so good too! The sauce is singular! As I am from Southeast Asia, I find nothing wrong with the environment or weather. It is quite easy to adapt. The service is good and the staff are friendly. Note that the restaurant does not serve alcohol. So try to enjoy some hot traditional China tea. It is good too
4
Food was good and the service was good. The only bad thing was the environment, as Singapore's environment can get really humid and hot, it was quite unfortunate for me not to be sitting in an air conditioned environment. But other than that, everything was good, a must go to enjoy exquisite dim sum food
5
Was not really crowded when we went (12+pm), didn't actually need to book.. but the atmosphere is really good when it's not crowded and dimsum is good n affordable!
5
The food was delicious and very value for money. One of the best dim sum places around. Best to go at lunch time as not much crowd as compared to dinner.
4
Overall experience was good. The food and services was overwhelming. The dessert was not that good compared to their main dishes. Will be back again!!
4
This could be my new favourite dim sum place. After ordering, the food started streaming in less than 5 minutes later. All hot and freshly prepared. It also has a good price (4 of us ate our fill for $24).
5
Best dimsum I've had in Singapore, hands down! The other dishes are also very good, particularly the sweet and sour pork.
5
Swee Choon never fails to disappoint me! This is my all time favourite place for dim sum because it serves all the authentic dim sum dishes that I LOVE!
3
Visited with colleagues after night class. Din sum are served fast and the taste is ok for me. Option for eater at night.
4
Awesome dim sum with reasonable price. Salted egg liu sha bun and mee sua kueh are super nice and a must try!
5
Have dined in before quite afew times already! We were seated promptly upon arrival and once we send in our orders, our food came within 8-10minutes, which is very efficient in service!
4
Been here a couple of times because it's opened till 6am in the morning. It is now also opened for lunch but do take note that it's closed on Tuesdays.Service staff aren't very polite so don't expect a five star service especially when there isn't any service charge to the total bill, just gst. A must order is soup dumplings, chicken feet, fried prawn wrapped in beancurd skin and egg custard buns. Bean paste noodles are not the best but not bad in Singapore. At around 4am, things will start running out/they'll stop producing certain items and offer a different menu
5
The Shanghai Xiao Long Bao is favorite dimsum here and everyone much try. Dumping also the best but this time can't have them.
5
The food here is varied, has a good price and very good service! One of the top dim sum places in Singapore.
3
Went here with Family, Wife and I are normally Din Tai Fung fans so expectations were high but grounded.Prices are extremely reasonable and it is very busy which is great sign. In our opinion the freshness taste was just not there like DTF. Selection is great and great hunger buster but location is to be desired and in our opinion needs renovation to modernise. Average but good when in area
3
It sells primarily Tim Sum and Zhi Char dishes. Average food quality (as food becomes cold strangely fast) and prices (may be slightly on the higher side). It's unique point is perhaps it's operating hours from 6 pm to 6 am. Well suited for supper and group dining if one is not particular about its quality. Do not compare its service quality and expect it to be same as a restaurant. Also, not every part of the place is air conditioned. Otherwise, simply enjoy your meal for the price you pay (with NETS or cash only and no credit card accepted). As it is located next to the main road, if you are sitting outside in the non air con space, it may be a bit noisy.
5
We ordered eight dishes for three people. The came out gradually which meant none went cold. The Pickled Chillie Vegetables went down a treat and next time ( tomorrow night) we will order two. The Spicy Sour Soup was amazing. With Chilly oil Won tons, rice Roll Pork Dumplings, which we dipped into the Soup mixture. We had the best Spring Rolls and the hottest I have ever had. The flavour of the Hometown Singapore Stir Fry Noodles went a treat with the Crispy Pork Rib with Pepper. Finally the Sliced Duck in Crispy wrapper went great. My mouth is watering writing the review and can't wait til we go again.
4
We stopped going to this place for some time cos previously we found the standard dipped from the usual. However, we tried the Portuguese egg tarts, 红油抄手 and yam paste recently and it changed our opinion of Swee Choon! Definitely coming back for more of our favourites soon
1
Sorry for this bad review. Yes price is cheap and it is the reason why their food sucks. Yes they have clientele but its because its the only joint that opens very late and it is fast in serving but besides that we wont be back. To be in Singapore and they serve this quality food, one would think you would be in a thirld world country wherein ingredients are hard to come by but Singapore is a country with lots of food
5
This place opens up at 6 pm until 6 am. So if you need a dim dum craving at night this is your spot. Its off the Singapore beaten path of pristine hotels and sparkling new building but there's nothing wrong with that. The food and service is great and pictures on the menu to help you order. I do only wonder how much MSG they use...
5
I was very satisfied with the booking experience from applying at Chope, as well as the service staff responding promptly to my request over the phone, patiently arranging for extra chairs as well as baby chairs for the kids.The best of all was that the number of chairs and table size were appropriately prepared and cleaned before we reach even when there are exorbitant among of customer lining up and service staffs were busy handling the crowd), simply impressive.Food were served very quickly as well, most of all the standard of the food (Dimsum) was maintained at top quality, happy that the quality of the food did not drop because of the high number of customersKudos to the chef and service staff for making the whole experience a memorable one
4
I went there solo for dim sums on a Wednesday night. It was still quite empty when I went but the queues quickly formed outside once I left at around 7pm. The food there is good, I especially love the har gau and chili oil dumplings. These are my best order every visit. There is only gst, no service charge levied on the food..
5
Entirely authentic - the place packed by locals. For a good reason - the food is good and affordable for many
2
If you've tasted dim sum from Hong Kong or Malaysia, food here would be disappointing for you. Probably only the xiao long bao is acceptable for our palate.
However service here is quite good and fast though.
5
Easy to find location with extremely fast service. Many options. Dishes are delicious and fairly priced.
4
Came here for the first time with family. Satisfied with the food and service. Will come back here again.
4
This is indeed a place known for dim sum!! The staffs there were really friendly and the foods were 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 .
5
Stopped by here to try the Dim Sum, my favourite being Chickens Feet. I always find that if a restaurant can serve good tasty Chickens feet then the rest of the food is almost certainly good. They didn't disappoint, all the dishes were excellent, add to that the cost and you have the perfect recipe. Excellent food & excellent value for money.We will definitely been going here again!!
4
The nearest station is Farrer Park MRT (not Farrer Road MRT stop - my mistake in getting off on the wrong stop )... If you happen to visit the place, try to include the below in your list:#121 Salted egg yolk custard bun#111 Steamed pork ribs#251 shanghai xiaolong bao#256 Peking Dumplin
4
After shopping in Mustafa Center in Syed Alwi street, one should try this Chinese resto just in the corner of Syed Alwi & Besar road from exit gate 6 of Mustafa Center. Dim Sum & ala carte menu is good. Try lava eggs, half boiled soy sauted eggs. Shrimp fried rice & carrot cake plus silkened eggs plates are good. Place is average but food yummy. It's OK-4 to me.

I have visited here several times before. This restaurant seemed to open late in the evening to early in the morning. There is inside seating and alley-way seating. I prefer the latter cos it seemed for relaxed, even though it might be a bit dirty for some. There is a wide selection of dim sum and other chinese dishes. I often have plain noodles - which itself is quite tasty. I also like the bean curd skin salad. The hot and spicy noodle soup isn't that great

This restaurant is a little bit far from MRT Little India. My friend recommendes this restaurant to me.I tried portugese egg tart and many dimsum.The taste was good and the restaurant was crowded in the night.Its difficult to reach the restaurant if you are tourist and the street near the restaurant very crowded with indian people
4
For me this dim sum restaurant is a ones of the best dim sum in singapore...the taste of dim sum is very fantastic, sometimes is long queue but is worthy for me.
4
Very nice, yummy and authentic dim sum serve at the old shop house. First time here, but really like the dim sum.
4
A great value for money. I enjoyed my visit to swee choon. I strongly suggest visiting here if you're brokebut still want a hearty meal.
4
Had a full lunch meal, dim sum are generally good, a tad cheaper than top Chinese dim sum. Good enough for me to come again for it. Parking can be very challenging, you can park at Mustaffa Center, short 2 mins walk away.
4
It's a well known Restaurant located at the heart of Jalan Besar in Singapore and it's attracts many celebrities, expatriates and tourists alike one must visit this place for tasty and yummy food.
3
Good dim sum in relation to the price. Quite surprised actually how they can keep the quality decent considering how much they actually have to cook here. This is definitely not fine dining, nor is it the best dim sum in Singapore, but if you're on a budget and you are craving dim sum, you'll be happy here
5
Finished work late and struggled to find food at 10pm. Our uber eats order got cancelled by the vendor so happened upon this listing in trip advisor. Was only 5 min drive from where we were staying and we were impressed with food, service and speed at which we got a table. Will definitely go again

Swee Choon is an old brand that has been diligently serving dim sum since the old days.Located in Jalan Besar directly opposite from Berseh food Centre, this is a nice place to visit before or after your meal. For me, i had just finished a meal nearby and came to pack some dim sum for the tum tum later in the day.Damage was $7 for 2 char siew pastries, 2 egg tarts and 1 big carrot cake which is pretty reasonable.Upon eating them, i can say this is absolutely worth the money. The egg tart is a cross between the Portuguese version with charred sugar on the top and an extremely buttery crust. This can be a boon or bane depending on your preference but it was great for me. The egg custard was well balanced and thick which added to my enjoyment.The char siew pastry, though small, was also good with a buttery crust and very nicely made char siew as its filling. Mostly, run of the mill versions fail at both parts, the crust and filling or at least one of them. Swee Choon's version tested well with me and my wife.Finally, the simple looking carrot cake was surprisingly good. It had some bits of chinese sausage, lup cheong, in it that really added a fragrance and sweetness that is very pleasing. The carrot cake was itself very soft and delicate along with mildly charred sides which was great.I don't know how i managed to not try this place for so many years but i'm going to be eating here a lot more often whenever i pass by. I'm sure their other offerings will be equally surprising given the sample we've had.Verdict: Worth a try

Bustling, super casual , but high quality food.No frills here, no alcohol even, but excellent tim sum style eatery.We ate loads of dishes and all (with one small exception) were good.I would hesitate to try anything from the menu and its open late late!Don't expect any fine dining aspects but do expect fine cooking.A gem
3
The dim sum is always my first choice because nice tasty and reasonable prices. I always go with large groups to have our dinners. Although the food size is getting smaller with unchange prices, the temptation is still there. However, until 2 daya ago when we visited, the staff there were so rude, especially young ones! I still remember the guy with spec, chinese, small eyes. When we asked to confirm the order quantity we have (we ordered 2 mango dessert, but they came 3), the guy said the writing is like 3 not 2. -.- Hello, just one mango dessert with all of 11ppl there, you thought we no money pay? We just don't want to waste food! Okay we eat then. Because this is my colleague farewell, so we request one of the staff help us to take group picture. Then the staff ask others staff, all like not willing to help. Then when the other staff askef the rude staff (above) to help, he even replied walao eh why ask me... This super rude attitude just not suitable to be in F&B line. We have do nothing to you somemore. Even ask him to refill hot water, he replied "har". Excuse me, if you don't want to serve, please don't wear the uniform and go home la. Anyway finally the lady staff helped us to take pic although this staff got a super black face.
5
Loved the food and service- efficient and no nonsense for both. This is as good as it can get. Bang for the money! Will definitely revisit.
3
Went with great anticipation as good reviews posted.
Food is not fantastic, price is considered not cheap with the ambience. Overall not a woah! experience.
4
Good food. Place already crowded even though just opened. The staff cleared the plates very fast when they see that you have finished the meal. Try their Liu Sha Bao. yummy!
4
Came for lunch and didn't have to wait for a table. Service is quick and friendly. Loved the pork and watercress soup
3
Although no service charge ,staff and service are good , keep it up , some items price are at the high side , air conditioning need to be improve quite warm.
4
Was brought to the palce by our hosts to try Dim Sum. Suprisingly packed at almost midnight. The siew mei and harkao are real tasty. They had fried cake which you call carrot cake surprisingly. Great with the chilli,
4
Great place to have Tim Sum at late night, wide range of food and Tim Sum, great place for gathering as they have expand their shop at bigger space.
4
When any of my friends come visiting Singapore, I always recommend Swee Choon. So finally sitting down to write a review. I always have a delightful time at Swee Choon, leaving feeling comforted and many a times full! I recommend having the Big Pau, Shanghai Xiao Long Bao, Sichuan Oil Chili Wanton, Salted Egg & Custard Pau and Portuguese Egg Tart. These are my personal favourites and have always been consistent in flavour the times I have visited

This is apparently a super-popular dim sum joint located in Little India in Singapore - everyone mentioned it to us during our recent visit so we thought we'd give it a try. There are no reservations so you have to put your name down on the electronic computer and wait for a bit until they call you. The restaurant itself is quite-dingy looking, not really inviting an with crappy seating, so that may put some ppl off. In terms of dim-sum dishes, we ordered about 10 (including beancurd prawn roll, congee, bbq pork buns, salt/pepper squid and siew mai) and I can say that they were all barely average apart from the Steamed Salted Egg Custard Bun - this single dish is *amazing* and can be an excuse for going to this establishment in of itself. What i did, however, think was unacceptable is that some dim sum dishes only came with 2 portions, instead of the usual 3 or 4 - that is totally "cheap-skating" the customer and unacceptable behaviour. Pricing for each of the dishes was otherwise fair and towards the low end - so no complaints there.Service was just okay - you have a bell button on your table and we had to use it a few times to get their attention. Otherwise it wasn't really a memorable visit and to us it seems that Hong Kong is still king in this food category..
4
a regular dim sum place for us; one of the most inexpensive i know in Singapore and such things don't lie, it is packed with teens on week end evening.not everything is premium on the menu but there are quite a few very good choices. and it is a good place, although not the best in Singapore, for Xiao Long Bao.Of course, it is an absolute no fuss \ no frill \ efficient service joint. still for us a good regular spot. pay attention though : no beer
5
Love the service, food and plus an in expensive place to eat frm 6pm to 6am. Sometimes i wait around the place for an hr just to b able to eat the pan fried pork dumpling.
5
Food was good, service was fast and most importantly the price is very affordable. will definitely visit the restaurant again!
5
The dim sum is one of the best around and for a reasonable price. The service is good too. The busiest time would be during supper so if you want a table it's better to go for dinner.
4
My local friend brought me here to feed me true local food. Tried a whole lot, a bit of everything. Really nice
4
Though the queue for a table can be long during dinner time (open at 6pm-2am every day and closed on Mondays), but the food never fails to amaze me. We love the spiciness the wontons have given to the tip of our tongues. Other options of dim sum, baos and porridge are all good. Prompt service as well
4
First off, if you hate queuing, don't try this resto. It's very popular with both locals and visitors, that there is always a queue every time I visit. But then, the original restaurant has expanded to several shophouse spaces, so I suppose the queue is not that onerous. Busiest time would be in the evening, but that's also the best time to be here to soak in a bit of the local atmosphere. Come here when you're in a group or are very hungry, as you'll want to try different kinds of dimsum or tim sum. It's tempting to order a little bit of everything because prices are reasonable, but be warned that you'll get very full if you do that. All the tim sum we've tried here was pretty good, so have fun ordering
5
I went there after work with some coll and it was fantastic. Dont get me wrong - they dont speak english that well and the receipt was in chinese too - but the dim sum are to die for. Ordering will work anyways because like in many other restaurants, you fill out a ordering form and the menue is in english too (with pictures). The prices are very good and it is a authentic way to have chinese food. I will come again and I can totally recommend it
4
24 hours eatery place located in Jalan Besah Area.Rather crowded around 12 plus midnight they served great xiaolong bao nut not the har gao taste horrible I guess due to the prawn are frozen prawn so not advisable to order Har Gao siew mai still acceptable and other dishes
4
I visited this eatery with a group of friends, who were in search of supper. I normally do not expect much out of casual diners, but my experience here was way better than my first impression of the place.An efficient system of seating meant that customers needn't have to wait too long in queue to get a table. The food was delicious, and the staff serviced customers with a warm attitude despite being very busy; a stark contrast to most other eateries where staff get increasingly frustrated as their workload increases. Also, the food came at a quick pace, which boded well for our ravenous stomachs. There was a plethora of items from the menu to choose from, from which we selected a diversity of dishes. They were all remarkably good, and what made it all the more pleasant was that the price tag that came along with the meal was not too harsh on our pockets.My supper cravings have seldom been satisfied as effectively with such quick and good food. This place is definitely a to-go for those looking for a snack in the middle of the night
4
We tried 3x (went on day and time they were closed ) and finally got to eat here! They start serving at 6pm and in weekend, the wait line starts around 7pm so go early! Coffee shop style - order from menu no push cart. Food served hot and tasty. Favorite - tofu with pork floss! 2-3 pieces per plate for the dim sum. Reasonably priced. Maybe a bit challenging to find. MRT - Farrer Park the. Walk from City Mall down Kitchener and turn right at Jalan Besar.
5
The dim sum is very simple but good, Price-wise very reasonable.
The hand-made noddles are very good.
The service is very fast and efficient.
4
The food here was very nice. Traditional style Hong Kong style food.
Price point was okay too ( if comparing the restaurant in Singapore).
More suitable for family or friends than eating alone.
4
Really good dimsum that is totally affordable. Recommend trying the pork chive dumpling and salty custard steamed buns along with their hot chrysanthemum tea to wash it all down. My go-to place for dimsum fix anytime!
5
Simply sit on the non-airconditional side of the house and you can avoid the queue. The food is served from the same kitchen
4
Had one round of dim sum over at swee choon at 4am! the siew mai , Shanghai Xiao Long Bao, Chee Cheong Fun , Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun , Chicken Claw , Beancurd Chicken Roll. The unique one would be the Swee Choon Mee-Suah Kueh!!!Tips : best to go for supper , if you go later most items would be sold out by 4am as they closes at 6am.Good for : Friends get together Operating hours : 6pm to 6a
4
Decent dim sum in Singapore, but the amazing thing is that the place is open from 6 PM onwards until the next morning so you can go there for your midnight cravings. Really near Mustapha Centre, and the queue can sometimes be crazy. Expect a 30 - 45 minute wait if you're there during dinner time
4
If you are looking for a nice local restaurant you should try this one. Sitting outside in more or less a canteen with local people is a nice experience and the food is great for a good local price. (dinner for 2 for $ 25). Down town you pay almost 3-4 times higher.
5
Came with a large group of friends past midnight and we managed to snag a table. We ordered a lot of dishes, especially the famous mee suah kueh, custard baos, banana and prawn fritters, pork dumplings and so on. The bill came up to 100 plus which was rather affordable. Food was fantastic and definitely a good place to go to for late night supper
4
I like every single dim sum I've eaten here, from har gao, shu mai, xiao long bao, bak pao, and carrot cake. But most recommended is their xiao long bao. The skin looked thick when it's served, but when you eat it, it splashed inside my mouth. Such a lovely pork stock.Ah, they open from 6 pm to 6 am.IG: @sharetheyum
4
Surprisingly we found this restaurant serve dim sum late night. We tried the signature mee sua kuih and it was a must try dim sum. They pan-fried the surface of mee sua till crispy, and you can dip with the sweet sauce. Tried the beancurd prawn roll, love the crispy bean curd skin! Other than that, we ordered chee cheong fun, custard bun with egg yolk, xiao long bao, overall foods is quite nice
4
The food, service is good.
just have to wait a little but it is worth it ;)
it is better to go on weekday !
4
Value for money, efficient service, attentive service staff, will be back for more.
Fried golden tofu is crispy yet soft
The Chee cheong fun with char sure is good
5
I love dim sum, and i've tried it at many places, but this has to be the best dim sum place i've been to. Very cheap and tasty food. Everyone has to try this one.
4
Glad that I was able to reserve a table this time round. With a 2 year old, we were still able to enjoy our dinner. My son enjoyed his dinner too. Good service
4
Quite a enjoyable dining experience ..with good food and atmosphere .the quality of food was great , quantity was sufficient , service we are satisfied .. Will recommend people to visit ..
4
Looking for food for supper. This dim sum restaurant provide from heavy meals to just light dim sum to enjoy with friends or family. Price of the food is reasonable. Prepare for queuing since this place is famous and well patronise by locals. Try their Mie Sia kue, is one of their famous dim sum menu. I will recommend to everyone to visit and try their food.
5
It was my first Swee Choon experience and now I understand why my friends keep coming back. Food is at par with Din Tai Fung and Tim Ho Wan, not the price! The place may not be posh but you wouldn't really notice because the food is something else. YUM
4
Everytime I have cravings for dim sum at night - this place will be at the top of my mind and one of favourite supper haunts. Its menu has a wide range of variety - be sure to try their very popular custard egg yolk buns and signature mee sua kuay.Best to go in big groups as price can be a bit expensive...
5
The price is very affordable, much cheaper than other dimsum restaurants. Efficient staff, the food come out quite fast after you order! My meal consist of 6 dishes, a dessert and a cup of water and it only costs me around S$21. Definately will visit this place again when i'm back in Singapor
4
Made a reservation so there's no waiting time. Food came quite fast after ordering too. There's two of us and we ordered 14 different dim sums to try. Among the usual har kow, siew mai and chicken claw, I personally liked their salted egg yolk custard bun aka "liusha" bao. The salted egg yolk filling really flows out of the bun and the bao is soft. I also liked their prawn and banana fritters, crispy on the outside, and a mixture of sweet and savoury from the inside because of the banana and the prawn filling. It's unique and tasty. I will definitely come back again for it.
5
This was a great find in Singapore. I love my dumplings and to find somewhere that serves dim sum from 6pm to 6 am was perfect after a late night working. Quality was fantastic, service was speedy. Will be back.
3
The food service was quite fast. Staff is helpful, manage to order what we want to eat. Overall it was good.
3
Quite delicious, with very affordable price for having dimsum at singapore. It opens at night so when you craving for dimsum at night, this place would be the perfect place
5
Sweet choon dim sum is good. Quality of the food is awesome. Service is good. But can improve further.
4
Swee Choon is a great Singapore establishment to dine at with the right expectations. It's not offering high end dim sum but a local experience. The restaurant has become extremely tourist friendly in terms of getting a seat and ordering food. Price-wise, it is actually not that cheap taking into account the hawker-ish setting but the lack of service charge makes it reasonable (gst is a given seeing how good their business is). Expect long wait times if you go during the weekends during peak dinner hours
3
I will not comment on the taste, as it's subjective and vary individual.There is a self-service reservation counter where one need to key in the number of diners and preference of where they want to sit (airconditioned or open space) before your given number be flashed on the screen to notify your table is ready (not in sequence).The waiting time can be as long as one hour or so when during peak period.Would be good you select those dishes you want on the menu list and hand over to the staff while usher to your table to shorten the waiting time.There is also a takeaway counter for patrons to dine out
4
Just had dinner here and the items were all freshly made and reasonably priced.They open at 6 pm daily (closed on Tuesdays) till 6 am. We arrived about 615 pm and managed to get the last available table in one corner. Diners who came after had to wait about 30-45 minutes and the queue got progressively longer.The siewmai and harkow (2 ewch per serving), as well as the salted custard buns, were especially enjoyable. We also liked the BBQ pork buns, with its deliciously sweet and tangy filling. We did find that the skin of the various buns were on the thick side, but the fillings were always fresh and tasty.The century egg porridge and the fan choy were okay, but not memorable, butnthe desserts of sea coconut with longan and almond tofu with longans made for a sweet ending to the meal. If you want something more substantial than dim sum, they also serve fried rice, noodles and chi zhar dishes.Dinner for two, including Jasmine tea and serviettes and taxes, came up to @$33, which we thought was reasonable
4
If you're super picky about your dim sum, this place probably won't be up your alley. But Swee Choon is dependably good, and has a few standout dishes that make you want to come back for more. Try the Char Siew Pastry and the Egg tarts. Very nice stuff. Opens till super late, so that's always a huge plus. Head to the nearby Mustafa after Swee Choon for some fun late-night shopping
4
Restaurant is jam-packed with clients when we came. You have to queue to be seated. While waiting, you can order your food by filling up the menu sheet. Menu has pictures so you have an idea on what you are ordering. They also put a star for recommended item which is good. Seating system is electronic making it organized.Food are delish!!! Dumplings, fried rice & buns are tasty. Though the desserts are a little disappointing. We ordered the coconut pudding & iced mango with tapioca.Tip: to be seated immediately, don't choose the seat. Also, wet tissue are chargeable and they don't have tissue so bring some if you will visit this establishment
5
This is the cheapest Friday night dinner my Husband and I have had in Singapore in 8 years. We were quickly seated at this crowded restaurant and food came out shortly after we ordered. Sure you can't have a beer and food isn't amazing but for the price and with very efficient service, we had a good dinner. I'd def return.
5
Affordable and nice yummy dim sum esp their salted egg yolk bun. Their Mee sua kueh is very unique and good as well!
4
Affordable and tasty, this place serves authentic local food and is a great option for those seeking a local culinary experience.
5
Dim sum very good.... Price also ok laah.... Dessert pun nice laaaah..... Price? Ok lah for a good food in the middle of the night....
5
Come here at 00.30 and all the menu still available. Luckily one table available. The taste is very delicious. One of the best dimsum I've ever taste. Surely will come back here again.
4
Went here at around 7:30pm. Have to take your own queue number. The queue number system will let you know the duration to wait. If you choose "seat anywhere" then you can jump lots of queue. We had it outside, windy and it is behind the lane. I personally like the mee sua cake and carrot cake. A wide variety of dim sum choices. They also cater to people who do not really like dim sum. There are some zi char dishes and also soup which is also very nice. Worth tryin
4
Loved the food and vibe of this place. Its near little India and be warned you will need to get a ticket number and queue for at least 30 mins. The wait is worth it, the menu is vast and all the dishes we had were super tasty. Would suggest trying 3-4 different types of dim sum as you want to taste the different styles and varieties. The service was a little lacking but they were so busy it wasnâ€™t something that could not be forgiven
5
Some of the best dim sum I have ever had ... and quite a nice pricepoint for the superb quality, consistency & service!I loved the shrimp wrapped in plantain and fried ... stunning piece of dim sum ... Totally recommended as a must stop if you are in Singapore
5
Swee Choon is a hot favorite for locals' dinner and supper, with queues to prove it. Be prepared to wait up to 30 mins during their peak hours (supper). Fortunately they have implemented an electronic queuing system so one do not need to stand in line. Opens from 6pm to 4am, serves as a great post-clubbing/pubbing eatery. Hargow, siewmai, mango prawn roll, watercress soup, liushabao, and the lamian are my personal picks. Highly recommended
4
Went there with three friends, we ordered nine different dim sum including xiao long pao and salted egg yolk bun, to this we drink tea and all this was less than 50$. Great value. Sometimes there can be a long queue and mind the odd business hours.Don't miss this place if you like dim sum
2
referred by a singaporean friend - went there on Saturday night the que was horrible!! Took a que ticket put your mobile phone number and number of seat you need and they'll send you update how far you are from getting a table... waited 30mins - 1 hour. The food was ok but is not worth for spending your time waiting to taste these ...
5
A very local coffee shop setting for an excellent meal of a wide varieties of dim sum & more. Pricing is of unbelievable good value. Quick friendly service. Highly recommended
5
Very yummy choices with wide variety, had a great time together with my secondary sch clique! Will definitely go back!
2
Yes, everyone knows this place and it has became famous over time. But the food wasn't as great as previous. Level of salt has increased and standard is dropping
4
At first glance this place may seem a little off-putting with the side of the road atmosphere, but if you`re able to embrace it you`re in for a real treat. The selection and variety of food is great and a real value for money! Best done as sharing plates so you can try a large variety
4
Had been patronising them since the 90s. Place have since expanded and is clean and neat. Ideal for a late night supper out with friends. Also good for just couples as the portion comes in small quantity which allow you to more choices of items you can order.The taste remain good and I particular like the Siew Mai (Use to be much bigger in the past) and Carrot cake.Worth a try for those craving for dim sum at night as they operate between 6pm and 6am
4
Nice place dimsum and very good chinese food. The problem is we are indonesia who always consume tasty food. For us they serve the food less of kick flavour. But it's still okey for us. Tips : if you don't need the tissue don't use it also the pickle it will be charge
5
If you fancy for affordable dimsum, good quality and big amount of dimsum with affordable price, this is the place to go in Singapore.SweeChun has been our regular place to have a meal with friends for years. With a large group of us (more than 10 pax), this restaurant is the place to go. They have indoor with aircon area, also a back yard outdoor area if you want to dine in fresh air and experience the tropical weather. I really like the out door area at the back, it has the feel of dining in the local "mamak-store", and dine like a local. Service is very good (asia standard) and very accommodating. One of our encounter with the stuff is: It is chinese new year season, and we brought our own "LouHei" to the restaurant, planning to have it with our big group of friends (about 15 of us). It is one of the common thing in Singapore is you are not allow to bring outside food to dine in the restaurant itself. But we politely request from the stuff, and are very friendly and accommodating, and allow us to "louhei" in the restaurant. The stuff is very understanding and being very reasonable, as they don't serve "louhei" in the restaurant, so they made an exception for us to "louhei" in the restaurant. They even provide us the utensils for us to "louhei". (Try to google "yusheng", you will know what is it about, and "louhei" is the local term for this celebration). We really very impressed with their service, we even apologies for making a mess of our table after "louhei", and they are very understanding and says it's okay to us with a big smile. Strongly recommended this place if you get to visit Singapore. Dimsum is one of the traditional food for Chinese. How to go there: 183-191 Jalan BesarThis place is very close to Mustafa at Little India. The nearest MRT station is Farrer Park Mrt Station, NE8 (along purple line/North-East Line).Dont forget to try their Liu Sa Bao (Chinese Salted Egg Custard Steamed Bun) and Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings). Pair with their homemade Barley drink. :)Enjoy your meal!!
1
Thought what the rave was all about, since we were looking for a good dimsum place to eat. Hell yeah even the taxi drivers recommended this place.From the reviews here too, i dont get it, which part is delicious? Is it because its too cheap that it will turn something bland into something delicious? This is Singapore and there are i mean there are really other dimsum options far greater in quality than this aweful restaurant is serving!Place is not clean, the toilet OMG, the toilet of a restaurant reflects how the kitchen is in that restaurant! I dont get the reviews here, i guess the cheaper the price the better the review! Not recommending and not coming back ever
5
I was recommended to eat here by a Singaporean friend and they didn't let us down. There was a queue and you get called through your mobile phone but as we weren't using ours I asked the guy what else we could do and he found a seat for us straight away (just two of us though)! We ordered steamed char siew (bbq pork) buns, dumplings with prawn and the ginger soup in them, and around four other dishes, it is the best dim sum we have had and we go to a lot of them at home (Perth) hut our first in Singapore. Would recommend this place to anyone

Most locals are no stranger to Swee Choon. With more than 50 years of heritage, it's one of the most established dim sum places around. Located at Jalan Besar, it occupies the space of four shophouses. Due to its popularity, long queues are no surprise (no reservations are allowed).Besides dine-ins, you can also take-away your favourite dim sum at their take-away counter.Xiao Long Bao! (4 for $4 - a tad expensive). With its thin but firm skin, tender meat and tasty soup, that is definitely a must-try!The Mee Sua Kueh kind of reminds me of Maggi Mee. Don't be fooled by its appearances. It is amazingly delish! The crispy mee sua coating the soft carrot cake made the kueh stand out from all the other kuehs that I've tried. We ordered 5 whole plates (aka 30+ pieces) of it. Chilled chicken in spicy bean paste - Reminded me of a Sze Chuan dish. Too spicy for my liking.Pork Ribs with Black Bean Sauce - It felt more like a yam-based dish than pork rib-based.Har Kow - Only 2 in a plate. :( The prawns seemed like they were literally BURSTING out of the wrap! It was delectable! Red Bean Paste Pancakes - Crispy pancake dough and a generous portion of red bean paste!Siew Mai - Huge, fresh and yummy with amazingly smooth thin skin.Fried Golden Tofu - Too dry and bland.Onion Pancake - Fragrant, crispy and delicious!Egg Custard Buns - IT'S LITERALLY THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD! The custard just flows out of the bun in the most glorious shade of yellow. PURE BLISS.Chicken claw - Well-cooked and chewy! The taste might be slightly too strong for some.Lor Mai Kai - Grainy and bland rice, but well-marinated chicken. Honestly I prefer Breakthru Cafe's more strongly flavoured rice.Plain La Mian with Onion and Oil - Springy and nice! Carrot cake - AverageBeancurd Prawn Roll - AmazingDeep fried crispy fish skin - Slightly too fishy and bland for me.Egg tarts and fried dumplings are average at best.We averaged about $20 per pax for that meal
5
i love this place! the dim sum is so good! my absolute favorite dim sum place in singapore. everytime i bring friends here they love it. for around 20S$ each you get a big feast of the best dim sum.
4
It's been a while since I visited the place. Thanks to the Chope app I could reserve a table with ease
5
Before visiting Singapore, i had a thought in my mind that i had to visit this restaurant to get the dim sum. It was very awesome.
4
Good food at affordable price! Love the salted egg buns especially! Do make reservations before that in case the queue is long
3
Food is okay.. but value for money... definitely not great dim sum.. and considering the long wait during weekend etc. i will stay away... go during weekday when there's no queue is fine for some quick bite...
3
Overall food was acceptable but tastes ordinary. Food was a little expensive but service was really good! Would still re-visit again but not frequently.
3
Service was okay, food portion was quite little. The reservation service is generally quite good as they seek confirmation an hour before the actual reservation timing.
4
This place is always busy, lots of people anxiously waiting for tables! The menu is no longer the typical tim sum menu. The operators has modified it to become a hybridised menu- a criss of tim sum and cher char. You can get char siew pau and fried noodles, Ma la Chicken and even jelly cakes for dessert.If the front of the restaurant looks busy , try going to the back alley, there's al fresco sitting there, it's can even look a bit romantic, eating Siew Mai under the stars!Bon appetit!

Headed down for a dinner gathering with my friends at Swee Choon with the chope App, i dont't have to wait outside amidst the long queue. When i arrived at the place, table was ready for me and from then on, everything was good. Food, Service, Overall 9/10! Highly recommende

Out of all the high end dim sum restaurants I've been to, Swee Choon still boasts some of the most delicious (and REASONABLE!) dim sum on the island. A pair of you can eat till you feel like bursting at the seams for under $50. Truly one of my favourite eating spots in Singapore. It's nothing fancy, but who needs fancy #amiright

Definitely best Dim sum in Singapore with all Favourite Hong Kong Sim Sim varies. Other Chinese food also very nice. Service is slow and difficult to get a table if you visit here in the evening.
4
Food was nice, yummy, delicious, cheap and most important they have a lot of choices. Waiting time takes around 15-30mins. You can choose to sit indoors or outdoors. Food was served quite fast.

Recommend: shrimp fried rice $6, braised beef noodle soup $6.5, food is delicious and price is very reasonable. My family love to come here weekend. This Cantonese Tim Sum restaurant very famous in local and operate from 6pm-6am.
3
Overhyped 24-hour dim sum place. The price is not really cheap for the quality and quantity of the dim sum served. There are more dim sum places that serve better dim sum, such as 126 dim sum.
4
Im not going to lie, this is not the best dim sum in the world but they are open till 6am everyday except Tuesday(?), i think. Options are order from the take out window or sit. No alcohol is served but service is prompt. The food is maybe 3 stars max if you are being generous but 4am dim sum centrally located gives you what you need when you need it
4
Very good quality / price ratio for this Dim Sum place. Good Chinese food served within minutes! Great choice, BBQ pork fried rice is highly recommended!Expect good things from the food, not so much for the ambiance (white lights, plastic everything, but good standard for this kind of restaurant!)Will definitely go back

Went there for a friend gathering and was given table quickly. Its our 2nd time patronising the shop. The Dim Sums were still as good as ever but the only bad side as the service crew's attitude. The forms that we are suppose to use to order might have been drawn by previous customers which lead to wrong dishes being served. We told the crew but their only reply was since there is a indication on the paper so they serve it. Being understanding we accepted the dishes . 2nd time we again failed to check the order paper and the service crew almost served the wrong dishes again. When we quickly called to cancel the dishes they were very rude.  - Always check the order paper for markings and the service crew should double check the order with the customers

Have been to this place several times and every time it is packed with people. Swee Choon is quite well known and an icon in Singapore. Been there for years and it open to very early hours of the morning.The service is fast if you get there early, if not it can take some time. Nonetheless it is worth the wait!Excellent food and a wide variety of dim sum. Prices are moderate for Singapore. A great place to go with a bunch of friends to share the food and share the experience.Will continue to eat there as I enjoy it very much!!!

It's been awhile since I had such tasty chinese food. We came all the way here which is kinda out of the way for us. It's worth the trip, was not disappointed. Seating was horrible, you either wait about half an hour for air-con seats inside the restaurant or you pick the seats in the alleyway behind the restaurant which is what we did. Ordered grass jelly with soya bean for drinks, 2 bowls of rice, haw kow, fried chicken, carrot cake, dong po pork and the signature dish, steamed chicken with egg is a must try. I enjoyed the dong po pork as well. Cost us $33 in total. Affordable and well worth the money.
5
If you want to eat great chinese food for local prices, this is the place to be. You can tell by the size of the place, and the crowd of people waiting for a seat inside (we were able to eat outside right away though).Don't expect a cosy atmosphere, just really good food and fast, but friendly, service. You order by filling in an order sheet and waving for staff, or pressing a button on your table.
4
recommend by friend.
nice food. not so expensive.
its affordable.
the liu sha bao and xiao long bao taste not bad.
need to queue.
4
I came at 11.30pm and wait to be seated for 30 minutes ..the food was good but not thats my expectation if im looking for the que ... but wort it to try
4
We waited about 5 mins for a table for 3 just after 11pm. Service was prompt and food was ok. The place is an experience to enjoy. Must try.
4
We went there at Saturday evening 545pm & there are people queuing (starts business at 6pm). Food are nice & economy pricing . Have to wait for quite sometime once the restaurant is packed😊
4
In Singapore you will find a lot of roadside restaurants... This is one of them.. Serving local food... The dimsums were different good.
Price was ok....
You should give a try if you are in neighbourhood and are fond of sea food.
5
One of the best places in town. My favourite food item there is Shi Zuan dimsum which is tasty and delicious. Visitors should head there early around 6 - 6.30pm to avoid long queue, esp at weekends.
4
This is not exactly a restaurant but more like a coffee shop. If you do not mind the queue and their odd opening hours, this is one of the best places to experience the Singapore of a bygone era and enjoy some great tasting traditional dim sum like a local
2
After hearing much over the years but never had the opportunity to visit, had to say that my first visit was disappointing. The steamed items such as siew mai and har gow are OK but nothing to shout about. Deep fried items are way too greasy, overwhelming the interior contents taste. The carrot cake for example would probably have been better off being pan fried, and oh by the way some dried shrimps and Chinese sausage would have also made the dish taste better.There were some unique dishes like the mee suah 'kueh' and the banana and red bean wrapped in egg white but sad to say not enough to entice me to return
3
Operating from evening to wee morning 6am, SweeChoon is the restaurant for many youngster. Place is neatly furnished with many friendly service staffs. Food quality however had deteriorated and not as good as before. Reasonably priced dim sum with great variety of selection. Do avoid dinner hours as you could be in for a 45 minutes wait if you are going in a group more than 5.
4
Not the usual Cantonese Dim Sum, so do not expect smooth thin rice roll like those in Crystal Jade. In Swee Choon, they serve Hokkien Dim Sum, the rice roll is thicker and comes with the sweet/spicy sauce, which I assume is Hokkien style. Personally, I'm not a fan for their rice roll, too thick and bland for my taste but the rest of their dishes are great. In fact, if you go with a big group of 5-8, you can order almost 70% of the menu. You will not be disappointed with any of the dishes. For those who is going in 2-3 pax, I would recommend these dishes: 1. Seafood Horfun (rice noodles with seafood & gravy)2. Century Egg Porridge3. Golden Tofu4. Prawnpaste Chicken Wings5. Siu Mai 6. Steamed Chicken Wing with Egg White (very popular dish since the 80s)7. BBQ Pork Pastry8. Fried Yam Pastry 9. Egg Tart10. Steamed Custard BunAverage $$$ Spent Per Pax: S$6-10Opening Hours: 5.30pm - 6am (Takeaway Counter open till 10am)Do take note that they do not open on Tuesday
4
We have tried many dim sum places of the same price range in Singapore and this is still the best. This is well worth the effort in getting to Jalan Besar; better than Wen Dou Shi at Sims. What we liked? Freshly made dim sum and you can taste the difference from the other places which may be serving up some frozen dim sums. Some must-trys include the Shanghai dumplings, har kow, egg tarts, pork buns, fried rice, long beans with minced pork, prawn dumplings among others. Queue They open at 6pm and if you are lucky, there won't be a long queue and you may still be seated in the first batch upon opening. We went for dinner at about 7pm once close to Chinese New Year (before) and there wasn't a queue. We were seated right away. We were rather lucky the first four times. I think it gets crowded after 8pm
4
This is the timsum place where you have to q! They have a very organised electronic q-ing system. First time I came here, it was a long q, 2nd and 3rd was considered only 10 minutes q. Perhaps because it was weekdays and 8 or 9 pm above. The food are fresh and the meats are packed. If you need anything, you can just press the bell
3
There is always a long queue outside thus restaurant whenever we passed by so we decided to give it a try one night. They are open from 6pm-6am which is good for people with late night cravings. You need to take a Q no. which will be flash on screen and call you when there is a seat already available. We ordered golden tofu, mee sua kueh, xiao lang bao, egg tart, big pau, pork dumpling and prawn banana fritter. All are good but we liked the mee sua kueh and big pau more. The prawn banana fritter is an interesting choice but a bit oily. Good value for money though dont go if youre really hungry coz you need to wait for a while.

Our family went for a dinner last night at the above-mentioned restaurant and experience that the practice of waiters and waitress using their finger nails to strike off the order form when each dish is served. Don't understand why they can't use a pencil is available at each table or carry one along. BTW, after striking off the order form they proceed to the next customers to deliver the foods. Such an unhygienic practice I expect come from a third world countries road side stall and never expect this practice in Singapore. Another point to note is that the most of foods served are not hot, such as the century egg porridge we order. Never to go again for dinner in this place

Our kids introduced this place to us in June this year after they ate there with their friends. Its an interesting place nestled within Little India in Serangoon Rd area (the actual address is along Jalan Besar). To get to the place, we actually drove along Syed Alwi Rd pass the famous 24 hour Mustafa dept store. This dim sum place opens in the reverse timing from 6pm to morning 6 am (where almost all other operate in the morning to lunch.Been there 3 times since June. Just gave the number of people in our group and get queue for a number - just like waiting to see the doctor and wait for number to be flashed on the screen. From the second visit on, we just decided to sit in the back alley and got our table almost immediately as most other guest wanted to sit in the aircon section. The back alley is actually very cool in the evening and our preferred location too - provided if it did not rain.The service staff are quite friendly and efficient. We tend to strike up a conversation with the waitress that assigned to take care of our table and it helps in building some form of rapport which adds positively to the overall meal experience.The menu has a wide variety and there is something for everyone. There is the traditional dim sum items - steamed, baled and deep fried. There is also the cooked dishes, la mian, xiao long bao etc...its a bit like a crystal jade kind of food stuff. Also find the food value for money. Its tasty, delicious and yummy. Portions are good sized for 2-3 pax to share. For 5 adult pax dinner, we spent around $80 in total. The last visit was 7 adult pax dinner and we spent around $120In our last visit there 3 weeks back, we went with our 3 kids and also 2 other kids (both boys) of a family friend whose parents went on a holiday - the friendly waitress said "wow" - we have 5 grown up children. When we said "no", she quipped that the 2 extra boys must of boyfriends of our 2 daughters...

Lots of people at night and with 4 shop lots, there's still a queue. Very efficient waiting list. We chose to sit "Anywhere" and received a text and call straightaway. Went through the restaurant to the back alley, sat beside an entrance door of foreign workers' accommodation. Quite amusing. We weren't famish so didn't notice if the service was fast or slow. Har kow was fresh but okay, Peking dumpling wasn't spectacular even with "chef recommendation" star. Mee suah cake was good but very tasty. Dry la mian with onion was good. 4 items at SGD13
1
came here the food part was really fast but the drinks part was just horrible , asked total of 6 times for my drinks never appear all they know how to say was "its too busy you just have to wait" I finished 3 times of re ordering and I finish my food every time u tell me I have to wait? Don't even bother to do a check for me. What kind of services Is this when they stated "restaurant" outside.
4
The dim sum in this place is tasty without being too oily or salty. It's basically one of the best value for money dim sum you can get in Singapore at night. The queuing system is quite organised and they basically make use of an electronic system based on your handphone number you input in a machine at the entrance.
4
Swee Choon is not the typical tim sum restaurant which we are used to for morning tea. They only open for business in the evening. Have been there quite afew times and had brought some chinese colleagues there and they also like the food served. One thing is that they have a wide selection of tim sum to choose from steam to fried. Price is reasonable and the tim sum are nice. However, will recommend to go earlier to avoid the crowd if not will have to queue quite some time especially if you go in a big group
4
This restaurant was my first stop when I arrived in Singapore. Got there at 2:30am and the place was still packed to my amazement. They couldn't speak English but no worries pointing to pictures of what I wanted and ordering. I love yum cha and this was fantastic and fresh. Priced well for Singapore, I don't know why it isn't rated higher on TA. They are open from 6:00pm to 6:00am, highly not typical for yum cha as it is usually a brunch thing. A must to visit especially after a night on the town ...certain cure for a hangover. A must to try!!
4
A street side restaurant that serves great food at late hours. The pork dumplings are the start of this place, a little pricey but worth it. When you bite into the dumpling a warm soup fills your mouth leaving you with a warm happy feeling.
1
Finally has a chance to try out this well known Tim Sum place as usually is either long queue and full house. Price is reasonable however, food served is not hot except sream items. Should be my only visit. Not worth to try again.
4
We went there approximately 10.30 pm and wow....the queue are still there! They have 4 places next to each other and all full.
After approximately 20 minutes we got our table. Food are normal dim sum, nice and not so expensive.
4
It's not the easiest to get to but it's pretty good. We only had a small selection of the entire menu, focused on dim sum. Only thing we did not enjoy : the siew mai (steamed pork dumplings) because the har gow (steamed prawn dumpling) is much better. Crowded so go just before 6pm to ensure you get a seat. (If not get a number asap)
4
I've heard mixed reviews about this place, but Swee Choon is one of, if not the best, dim sum I've had here in Singapore. All five dishes I ordered were above par and the bill came back more than decent. Definitely worth making the trip for
5
Head down to swee choon on a Sunday evening. My husband and I reached at 6.15pm and there was already a queue!! (Opens at 6pm). We don't mind a non-aircon seating, hence we got our table much faster than others. I must say that they provide quite a wide variety of dishes on their menu. From Hong Kong to Shanghai dim sum, and other zhi cha and appetizer dishes. The service is quite fast, with helpful waiters/waitresses. From our first dish to the last, we loved it sooo much. To mention a few memorable ones: 1) Swee choon signature mee suah kueh: Crispy brown skin packed with soft mee suah. Awesome. 2) Salted egg yolk custard bun: Perfectly flowy salted egg yolk. Love these sinful buns so much. 3) Sichuan oil chilli wanton, beancurd prawn roll & Red bean paste pancake: The skin/crust is thin and fully packed with meat/paste. Yummy and well-worth the money!! 4) Steamed chicken with egg & sweet & sour pork ribs in black vinegar. Do reach there early (around 6pm). As the queue is terrible when we finish our food at around 7pm. We will definitely drop by again :) This is definitely a nice place for dim sum at night or supper!
4
Sick of the endless shopping mall food courts in Singapore? This place is old school with bamboo steamers filled with dim sum in the un-gentrified Jalan Besar area near Bugis. The dim sum is very good but you have to be prepared for a wait though. They open from 6pm to 6am so they serve the late night clubbers. The clientele is definitely young - teens and 20's mostly while I ate there which is kind of strange for such an archaic (for Singapore) restaurant. The price is very good for super expensive Singapore and it's fun to see the crowd and the food whizzing by
5
We we're introduce to this restaurant by a Singaporian friend and we were not disappointed. Best dim sum totally authentic and very tasty. We got seated straight away although there was a queue we were asked if we wanted to eat outside so we said yes. We were taken through the kitchen to an outside seated part of the restaurant and it was fine. The menu has photo's and in English you are given a sheet to write the amount you want. This place is very close to The Mustafa Centre. Give it a go!
5
We got lucky and were seated right away, but we saw the lines that everybody talks about when we left. Never mind the lines. Wait for a table because this is just amazing dim sum. We only wish we had more room in our tummies because it was that good
4
Pretty much everything on the menu is good. Honestly. Service might be an issue though since they are just so packed! Truly, go with the mindset that you will not get service, and you'll be fine. Takeaways might be an option as well since it can be quite a wait to get your own table
4
close to the J8 hotel and was a fun experience. ring the bell for service, hand in your filled out menu, and sit back as the row of dishes arrive. the were very busy during our visit.
4
Great food.. Bun with salted yolk was great. Siomay harkau lau mar kai chee chong fun was great too.. Definetly will come back for more...
4
Absolutely must place to go if you are around the area. Dim sums are great and variable, so you have plany where to choose.
4
Went there for supper a few times. Not very convenient to go if you not driving though, so we walked from Mustafa.Very nice food. Had been years since I tried and the standard still maintained. Price is cheap as well. Recommended food are century egg porridge, liu sha bao, carrot cake, chee cheong fan, shrimp dumpling (ha kao) etc. ^^ If looking for a good place with nice supper, and you are driving, you can try this restaurant. Well commendable ^
4
Swee Choon has always been my favourite place when it comes to dim sum, especially when it comes to their salted egg buns. There is usually a long queue but if you don't mind to sit at alley, you can skip the queue and get a table right away
4
Went as a 4 person family..Came in as hungry person and went out very2 fullOrdered all in all 25 dishes. With a bill of 90 sin dollars.Very2 satisfying indeed.Steam salted egg yolk, har kau, siomay is out of this world..Will certainly return here again.
4
A place to have a simple yet a great meal. The waitress (Magret) was so helpful to me as I only eat fish and finding a dish without meat is next to impossible in a Chinese restaurant in singapore. She assisted me even with the restaurant running full. It's open only after 6pm till 4am! No beer but the food will make it forget.
4
Great place for Shanghai and Cantonese dim sum in Singapore. 24 hours. In comparison to the sparkly 'dim sum' establishments in Singapore malls that make you pay more money for the interior blings rather than good food. Must try the soup dumpling (xiao long bao) and salted egg yolk custard bun.6 adults, ate till our buttons popped and we paid only SGD77 in total!Depending on luck, you may have to wait for 30 minutes before you can get a table. So try not to go there during peak hours like breakfast, lunch and dinner time
4
I used to go often, however recently it has been too over crowded for a pleasant experience. The food still tastes good, and some new items in the menu are pretty good too. I always go for the mee sua cake, siew mai, chilli oil wanton, fried tofu, these are the ones that make the wait worth it. ^
2
This was my 2nd time at Swee Choon. The first was about 18 months ago and I thought that it was a decent place for late night tim sum.However, during my visit last month, my wife and I were sad that the quality of food had dropped significantly. Service was brisk but we were disappointment with almost every dish we ordered.Perhaps the recent publicity made it too busy. Wouldn't recommend this to tourists
5
Not many tourists will know that the best dimsum (and good value for money) in Singapore can be found in Little India. One of the best restaurants I've tried. Salted egg yolk bun is a must try!!
4
One of my favourite Dim Sum places in Singapore, mainly because of the really laid-back atmosphere and efficient service. Don't expect to be treated like a VIP though.Food is pretty good and it usually arrives at your table soon after you place the order, and seldom with any mix-up in the orders. 2 thumbs up for that!Their salted egg custard bun is a must-try. The standard dim sum fare (har kau, siew mai, etc) is pretty all right too
5
We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere to eat around our hotel. It seemed to be famous among the locals because the restaurant was packed. We had to queue but it was just like 5mins and then our number was called. It's a great chinese. The only thing was that their receipt has no english translation. So we weren't really sure if the items in the receipt were exactly what we had ordered. All in all it was great to have stumbled upon this restaurant.
4
Swee Choon expect lots of customers each day, it operates from 6pm to 6am everyday excluding tuesday. Getting your car parked can be a huge issue so be prepared to scout around for slots.Average waiting time can be around 10 - 30 minutes on an average day. Interesting facts:1) Every table has its own dedicated service bell which is really refreshing. 2) Dimsu service is really fast, you even get your dimsum before your drinks!3) It's noodles aren't very good. All in all, do come down to experience Swee Choon.
5
This is certainly one of those off the beaten track places that I would not have discovered on my own. It is one of the favorite dinner places of my friend here in Singapore and she took me here to try almost everything on the menu! The queue was long but it was worth the wait. Fantastic food and relatively cheap. Of you like Dim Sum and other Chinese dishes, definitely try this. One of my favorite (other than the dim sum of course) was the chili sauce deep fried tofu. Yumm
4
In Singapore, there is no many late night supper. We only can think is MacDonald .. There is Dim Sum that is open till late night. There is a lot of variety dim sum to choose from. I love their porridge and egg tarts. The price is reasonable and affordable. Sometime their service is quite slow.. * don't get outdoor seat because i saw rats running around 
4
This dim sum restaurant is just 5 mins away from me but I'll usually do takeaways only. They bought over the next door shophouses and expanded their business over the past 2 years. This is a restaurant with 50 years of history - currently selling both HK or Cantonese as well as Shanghai dim sumIf you want dim sum from 6pm to 4am, this is probabaly the only place in Singapore that would satisfy your cravings. There was a long queue at 7.30pm. We were given a queue number and the menu and order form - and were told that it might take 20-30min to wait. While we were seated comfortably at the waiting area, we managed to decide on what to eat before we were called by the queue system (less than 20 mins' wait).Service was prompt and efficient. We were served almost immediately after the order form was handed to the service crew. They were smiley and polite. Soon, our table was laid with food and bamboo steamers. We paid abt $50 for abt 15-18 dishes. Our fav were the red bean pancake, carrot cake, brinjal in bean sauce etc. The usual siew mai, har gow, and char siew bun were good too.In general, don't expect wonderful top class service (like those from expensive restaurants) or fancy delicacies like sharksfin dumpling or scallop chee cheong fun - this is the place to go for if you just want down to earth everyday dim dum ;.. at late hours ... for a reasonable price (Cash and NETs only
4
Dim sum consists of a wIDE assortment of small dishes like dumplings, carrot cakes, egg tarts. There's even noodles. The food traditionally is eaten for breakfast but swee choon opens late and people usually go there for supper instead. For a casual eatery, the food is surprisingly good. Just don't expect your food to be as delicate as those you find on restaurants. My top picks would be fried chicken wings, egg tarts and buns but practically everytjing's bite-sized and delicious so you may end up eating more than you intended. Order a cold soy bean milk to go with the dim sums.
3
The restaurant hires elderly as waiter and I am alright with that. In fact, I thought that it was good to provide them with jobs. But the last time I went, an uncle aged around 50 plus spilled some hot water from the basket containing dim sum. It was unintentional but he did not intend to clean up. It was the condensation for the steam in the food basket and all the water from several basket collected at the base of the tray. When we ask him to help us wipe politely when he walk past us, he threw a rag on the table and ask my mum to wipe it. I really was speechless then. Did not want to spoil my family's mood but it was way too much.
4
This is a good place to fill up ur stomach if you have craving for dim sum, anytime of the day. simple fair and simple setup with simply service and simply economical. One dish to highlight is the salted egg yolk pau which is simply delicious. pretty economical in terms of price and so, don't expect ambience and great service here
