They provide prompt and alert service whenever assistance is required. Food are fresh and soup are served hot. Staff know their job well and always so caring to elderly.

Visited Coca @ Kallang many times. Though menu not alot but its enough. Embience is very nice and service is good
3
It‚Äôs just normal steamboat with lesser choice of soup and food selection. We tried ala carte menu which has slightly more selection than buffet. Golden mushroom cost $10. A portion of pork costs $12.
4
always an old favourite place to satisfy your steamboat cravings. the buffet is more value for money given the unlimited portions 1 can order.
5
My family was extremely happy with the restaurant ambience, seating arrangement and most of all the fresh ingredients & chilli sauce for the steamboat. Initially my mother was abit hesitant to take steamboat but after the lunch, she had good comments and would definitely retrun for future lunches/dinners
4
I couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Having not been to Coca for a long long time, I decided to dine there again. It brought me fond childhood memories with the signature chili dip and fish glue. What impressed me more was their attentive waiters and waitresses who were always there to help. A wide selection of choices of steamboat dishes ranging from seafood, meats, vegetables etc. There is bound to have something for everyone. I will definitely return, not because there isn‚Äôt a better steamboat buffet elsewhere, but I will return for its sincere customer service and for rekindling my childhood memories. P/s: there was a chinese, young male intern which I would like to comment for his attentiveness and great service. His attitude was worth way more than an intern. Hope the management will cherish such wonderful worker.

Easy reservations with Chope except that we wanted an earlier slot instead of 12:30 but was told 11-12 is full. Hwr upon arriving the entire hall is empty save for 3 small tables used. Was wondering why. We could have not needed to loiter around but proceed with food. Good thing was food met all expectations.
5
There got a lot of food to be choose. They are fresh made food. Good service. But cannot sit too long because it is full house.
5
Good dining place. Have been there many times. Value for money. Went there at 7.45pm do not have to rush some places their buffet have time limit.
5
great! food and service was good. overall very satisfied. had the buffet ($43.20++) for dinner. would definitely go again
4
This is a repeat visit. A pleasant experience in overall. Comfortable atmosphere, with staff that were helpful and attentive. Food were fresh, and it was good value for money.
4
The service was efficient! The staff was helpful in helping us get the table earlier than our reservation time. The soup base for steamboat was good too!
4
The food quality was good and valuable for money. Overall a pleasant experience and we will definitely go back again.
5
Good variety, nice soup for steamboat, excellent sauce with condiment like coriander garlic. Fresh made balls and fish glue are super nice!
5
I really love this place. The food is excellent quality, the broth is absolutely beautiful both the Tom Yum and the chicken, and the service is very good! Alex the manager really looks after you. Better hurry though, their last day of trading at this outlet is 15th March 2018
2
Food was really good but the cleanliness failed big time. Cutleries was either dirty, stained or maybe wasn't even washed properly. Found a small fly in the soup and only to be replaced with no apologise from the manager or staff. Food and replacement of items took too long
5
We had 2 soup bases and tonnes of food. The variety spread was not too wide and the serving portions were small. Fortunately, we had attentive staff who served us when we needed refills. There was also a 1 for 1 promotion on the Coke which pleasantly surprised us.
5
Very attentive and prompt service.
Food was fresh also. Will recommend to my friends to visit this outlet for steamboat.
4
Seniors enjoy discount.
Food is great, Service is excellent
Carpark is convenient
Cozy and quiet ambience
4
Fresh
Yummy
Service staff attentive.
Soup base salty better if less salt msg. Kept drinking water after meal.
4
We chose the ala carte menu instead of going for the buffet menu as I came with a group of girls. Good was average. nothing special.
3
Visited Coca for a friend's birthday. Friendly and fast service. The steamboat has good base stock and the selection of ala carte buffet items was quite satisfactory. Seafoid items were fresh and yummy.
5
Restaurant was very clean and service staff were very polite. It was a pleasant, peaceful and delicious lunch with my family.
4
Always delivering the good food and ambience.
Staffs attentiveness can be slightly better and with more friendlier approach.
4
Environment is conducive and the food quality is consistent. We will come back again for another meal.
5
The chili sauce is the best thing here, quite a variety and service was good. The tomyum soup is more towards the sour side not the spicy side.
4
One indian staff was very attentive. If you like steamboat must go there for steamboat. Nice n fresh
4
Service provided was excellent. Food was acceptable. Recommend to book early for Fridays evenings and Weekends as their buffet slots are easily fully booked.
5
Quite a good experience
... The food was good and felt that the service was also quite proactive and pleasant
3
Mistakes in our orders. Those we ordered didn‚Äôt arrive and instead were given those we did not make any orders
4
Location good with ample car parking space.
Fast service..attentive staff that responded fast to our need.
4
Would recommend anyone who's looking for steamboat. Would be perfect experience if could have the premium buffet. But was sold out by 1pm. A wasted trip in my opinion.
5
The staff is very fast on answering on our request to accommodate the baby and helper needs. Speedy service and good food quality
5
loved the food! loved the spread. really enjoyed it.
would come back again.
my mates enjoyed it as well.
5
Food serves are fresh. Garlic rice , fish glue, oysters, cockles , meat ball just to name a few. Fantastic.
5
Excellent service and ambience. Price affordable. Good food and good company makes it never a dull moment!
3
Wish they have more soup base choices to choose without extra charges. Overall food was ok.. service was prompt & good. Considering the price... it was reasonable...
5
The place is nice and quiet. Very cosy environment and the food are fresh and prompt when ordered.
The service staff are friendly and are very prompt in topping up the ice water and soup.
3
Though I understand that it is a buffet and I can just order again, but It upsets me to have missing orders. The food was just ok. Oysters were not fresh and cockles extremely tiny.
4
Good lunch with nice ambience. Service was excellent and and price affordable. Highly recommended. üòÑüëç
3
reasonable value for money. Tables less cramp than at Taka. service fast and portions are kept small which is good to prevent wastage. Standard fair, good place to go to avoid crowds and get your steamboat fix.
4
Dining experience was above average. Food, service and atmosphere was good. Value for money. Overall very good.
2
Disappointed with service and one of the ordered dish did not come out despite 3 reminders to 3 different waiters - yet item included in billbut was removed after I pointed out to cashier said food item was not served at all!
5
PREMIUM LUNCH BUFFET Well worth it. Lobster is really mini but it changed the entire chicken soup base to very nice mini lobster bisque.
4
I book for 745 however we reached early at 7 and the staff check for table and let us in although the restaurant was quite pack at the time. The service staff is very friendly and quick in refilling our sauce and soup. Good experience and will come again for sure
3
The basic set is good enough for hotpot fix. The additional top to Premium is not value for money. The lobsters are not really fresh, maybe due to mass thawing in the kitchen. Likewise for the scallop, sea cucumber and fish maw.Just opt for the basic buffet set. Period
3
I went on a weekday and the place was quite empty at around 6:30pm. The interior of the restaurant was nicely decorated and you have the feeling like this is a five star restaurant. However, the food quality was just average for the price of $50/pax as this is my first visit so it might prob be my last as well.
3
An average restaurant which tried to give customers that they were getting volume of food offered under the buffet package. Nothing to set this restaurant apart from many. So will I visit again - maybe if I want value for money otherwise probably not.
4
Value for money on food, services and the atmostphere. Will recommand friends and re-visit the place again.
4
Staff is attentive and friendly. The service is not bad. The food was good but not sure if there is any MSG in the food. Overall, it was great
5
Staff were very attentive. Offer to change plates and fast with order. Restaurant about half filled when we dined there around 2pm
4
Staff were pretty friendly. Personally thinks this outlet is more spacious than the one at ngee ann city? . As usual, i love the handmade dumplings and wantons.
5
Service was excellent, food was fresh but would have been better if the selection was a little wider.
4
WIth so many steamboat restaurants in the market, COCA still a place to visit because of the fresh ingredients. However for a better value of your money, please visit the outlets during dinner timings as the variety of lunch is rather limited.
5
I have been to Coca a few times and I really love their tom yum soup there. My favourites in the tom yum would be silver noodle, green noodle, prawns, yam and golden mushroom because they all absorbed the soup. Also, it's really clean and hygienic (food-wise). Overall I really liked my experience there
3
This steamboat restaurant offered both buffet and ala carte. Recommended to go for the buffet as we have 4 adults and 2 kids and we ate almost near to buffet prices in the end. The steamboat got free chicken and tom yum soup which herbal chicken soup got to add additional. The only down point is that they do not offered set meal like Thailand. The ingredients are fresh though, the food also served fast. During dinner time there are a lot of people so reservation is preferred
4
It was an advance Mother's Day celebration and I was racking my brain on where to bring mum. Then I remembered Coca that I have been once and forgotten to return even though it was good for the first time. So our family of 5 went to Coca at Kallang as I understand that that branch of Coca has a special Cockle Salad and we love cockle. The salad turned out to be a disappointment and we didn't eat much of it. For a salad, I believe that there should be more larger sized cockle and the salad sauce is far too sour. Unless they improve, I will never order this dish again. The steamboat however was very good. We ordered the spicy tom yam soup but as it wasn't spicy enough, the waitress promptly brought us a generous amount of paste so that we can adjust according to our taste. This is understandable as not everyone can take very spicy soup! The vegetables, meat and seafood are all very fresh. Their Signature Fish Glue and Homemade Meatballs are very tasty and we repeated our orders as it's alacarte buffet. One mustn't forget their special chilli dip too! Service is prompt too. No complaints. At the end of the meal, I am the only one charged at $27.50++. My parents, brother and daughter are all charged at $20++ each as they are senior citizens and my kid is a student. Repeat visit recommended 
5
The food was grear but lack of soup choices. Only 2 available. Food were fresh n nice. A bit pricey for children at $20++
3
Can have more varieties. Chicken soup was good. Environment is clean. Good service by the staff. Good
3
handmade beef balls and the special wanton are good, must order. remember to ask for rice and egg, cook some porridge before you go, yummy! the tom yam is average nia, can miss. service level and crowd are alright, kallang outlet is not as crowded.
4
Spacious place, clean and good service. Lunch buffet is reasonable deal and easy access by MRT.. recommended!
3
Food was fresh and to our liking, service staff was friendly but could be improved and it will be good if there is some small snacks to munch. (But not peanuts)
5
-Staff were friendly and attentive
-Especially a Indian male staff gagan
-food were clean and fresh
-love the atmosphere
5
Very good choice of buffet food available. Recommend to select the premium seafood option for the lobsters and scallops!
5
Excellent and friendly service, and impeccable assistance was rendered on the serving of the birthday cake which we brought along. Love the dining atmosphere at Kallang too. Far more peaceful and less chaotic than the Orchard branch!
3
Fresh choices, thou small in portions for buffet. All the servers kept asking how old my kids were; at least 5 different times we were asked. Was quite annoying but i guess it was because they were afraid we would "cheat" cause the kids were not getting buffet but ala-carte fried rice. Other than that, food was tasty and overall a pleasant experience.
4
Coca steamboat has been one of the fav place whenever my friends & I want to have a steamboat. Food is kept fresh & clean using cling wrap. Service is good & almost immediate with attentive staff. Love their prawn balls, house special dumplings etc. Wide range of food to select from. The branch @ Kallang is rather spacious, like the ambience there!
4
Excellent Thai Steam boat with fish fillet, beef fillet, chicken fillet, fish glue, special fish ball, golden mushroom, cabbage
5
Clean and nice place for small family dining. A trainee staff was very attentive to our needs. One of mine fav outlet due to location and ample parking.
5
Good quality food at reasonable price and friendly stuff. It not often you got plate change at a buffet setup and mini lobster top it off as great value
5
Excellent. The roast pork combi and the roast duck were excellent starters. We were also very happy with the oysters and the unlimited amount of thinly sliced beef. Only disappointed with no enough Tang O.
3
Value for money Thai steamboat. Seafood is very fresh esp prawns. Ambience is good and cosy. Location is very convenient just next to MRT station.
4
My second visit to Kallang outlet, supervisor was efficient service staff were helpful & friendly.food as usual was good no doubt about it..will definitely visit again
5
The ingredients were fresh and service was great. Good for family and friends gathering. Will defiitely returning soon!
4
I am always delighted to eat at Coca. Items prepared by Coca is fresh especially the "balls" items. My favourite are prawn, squid, chicken and pork ball. Not forgetting the wanton and dumplings too, great freshness in them. I would also like to comment on the fish glue and garlic rice too
4
Coca was the first restaurant I had Tom Yum steamboat more than 10 years ago in Bangkok. They still continue to serve the soup base that is consistent in taste and ingredients that are fresh. I like Coca also because their service is prompt and the buffet is value for money (if you can eat a lot). The outlet at Kallang Leisure Park also has private rooms which is good if you are looking for some private dining
4
Variety of food is good and fresh. Only tomyum and chicken soup base are available. Must top up $20 and $25 to change to fried fish head soup and chicken collagen soup which is very expensive! Staff are efficient and have good attitude so overall it is still a good experience
5
Ambience is cool
Food is fresh
Quantity of food is well balance
Service is quick
Staff is friendly
Good team spirit
5
Food and service was good. Ambience was nice and cosy. Coca Staff were very pleasant, at tentative and accommodating!
3
Honest good & fresh good served. Atmosphere nice. The staff needs to be more customer focused. They should be prompt to share any promos.
3
Quality of food is good but it feels like the soup is not as good as before. Especially the Tom Yum is kind of diluted now and not as flavourful.
3
When ordered came, every plate with meat, there is red bloody water in the plate.
Other food was fresh though
Veg was fresh but came with some already rotten.
5
Came upon this steamboat recommendation from Facebook and so decide to try it out with my family to kick-start the new year. I must say it's money well spent. Good food, though not very great variety, good ambient and great service staff.
3
Service was average as they seems to be shorthanded. Not enough staffs catered for year end lunches.
4
Nice atmosphere to have meals with friends or even business meetings. Attentive service staff and fresh ingredients served, definitely value for money.
4
Unlimited flow of a selection of meat, seafood, vegetables. Pretty fresh. You get a choice of 2 soup bases per table. We chose the default chicken broth and tom yum. Chicken broth was pretty bland, tom yum on the other hand was overly sweet and not in the least bit spicy. Service could be more attentive but overall was a pleasant experience
3
Food are nice. Staffs attitudes need more training as when asked them questions no smile and showed a face of unhappiness. In charge of collecting payment staff also need more training. Smile more and don't make it seem like customers owe them money when we are just there to enjoy a meal. Prefer the outlet at Takashimayah, staffs are very friendly and helpful
4
food is fresh and certainly can add more choices in the menu. Not too crowded , suit for friend gathering and the service is good.
1
Horrible experience, staff with bad attitude- rude and unpleasant, signature chili was diluted, a total disappointment.
3
The variety dishes for Buffet is a little disappointed judging from the amount they charged. Hope they can either adjust the charges or increase the variety of the dishes for Buffet.
4
Love their chili and their soups and their green noodles. Pretty worth it. Would head back again. :)
5
Nice and attentive staff in a quiet ambiance with really fresh food! Definitely coming back for more!
4
Overall was good and ambience was something we like. Lunch menu selection seems to be lesser than before. Quality of Chili seems to be different (sweeter) and fish glue is so much thinner. Otherwise overall is good. Will come again.
5
Good food at value prices. Service staff did a good job at meeting our needs and were helpful in quickly replenishing ll requested food items!
5
Klp steamboat session
Food was amazing
Place was nice n comfortable
It was quite quiet so easy to talk to friends
Service was so good
5
As usual, never fails on the food and services was prompt as well as attentive.
Quick to provide seating arrangement.
5
There are only 2 soup base (tomyum and chicken) with many different fresh ingredients. Really worth the money, even more so when there is a 20% Safra discount :)
