Tasty and good looking dishes in a very busy and laud restaurant. Rude and untrained waiters like from china town market. Food will deserve 4stars but the service is pulling it down.

I had been to multiple Chinese restarents by far this was the Most boring one. The food options were pretty blunt and lacked the taste

The Putien chain of restaurants offer consistent and good quality food.
The house specialties like lu mian noodles, fried bee hoon, fried oyster omelette never disappoint.

The restaurant is usually busy and this is not place to have a leisurely meal. Expect busy clearing of plates and dishes. But the food is generally well cooked, unpretentious and comforting.

The restaurant itself looks unpretentious despite its Michelin star. Some of the dishes they serve are rather unique. Everything we've tried tasted great.

Visited with Singaporean friends after busy morning around Singapore sights. Very busy and we just managed to get a table. This is part of a chain created by chef who got 1 Michelin star for his food market restaurant and our friends told us that he refuses to go upmarket and charge excessive prices and wants to offer good food at reasonable prices to all an amazingly refreshing viewpoint. We shared some great dishes - drunken cockles fantastic, lotus seed with white fungus soup (kind of dried mushroom), stir fried yam,steamed prawns with minced garlic,home made bean curd, stir fried chilli clams and spinach in supreme soup - every dish was truly great in flavour and all enjoyable. Well worth a visit to one or more of the outlets even if you have to wait for a table

On 3 February 2018, visited Putien Restaurant located at Marina Square. 15 minutes queue time before we were offered a table. Clean place with friendly service staff. Serving set menu, festive set menu and alarm carte. Decided to order alarm carte. Order 1 appetiser, 4 dishes and 1 soup. Food sufficient for 3-4 diners. Clear soup was good. Fried oysters filled with flour and tasted extremely greasy. Garlic prawn was tasty too. Sweet and sour pork was fine. Do not know how to appreciate the fish. Unlikely to order the fish and fried oyster again.

The day we wanted to try it in Ion Mall, we would have had to wait for more than 2h. In Sentosa we just walked in.Food is very good, setup however is pretty simple in comparison to the quality of the meal. My boy got a blue balloon, this is nice. The local team in Sentosa would however benefit from a better proficiency in English. Only the woman at the reception had a decent knowledge of English. All waiters and waitresses inside were always assuming rather than understanding which lead to some confusion. Otherwise, maybe a great place to test your Mandarin? Just joking. This is the restaurant where I've had the biggest difficulties to be understood in Singapore

My wife and I were wandering around raffles tower shopping centre , when we felt like a bite to eat, as all we have been doing for the past 2 weeks is eating , we felt like something a bit lighter.It was rush lunch hour in Singapore , so we wandered into Putien, as the photos of the soup on the menu looked great,We were not to be disappointed .The place was jam packed with locals, we were the odd people out , to the point where the waitress said"do you like this type of food"Hey, it's food so we will always give it a try.All the flavours were fresh, and abundant , we just wished we were in Singapore longer to try more!The prices were also surprisingly good for the quality and taste of the food.This place is definitely worth a look if you like Chinese style food, I am only not sure what region this food is authentic to, sorry

Lots of noise from clanging of porcelain plates and cups add kitchen staff handled them. Small seating areas.Food was OK ie nothing exceptional. Dishes were average tasting. Fried yam dish was boring. Sweet and sour pork had more dough than pork. Chinese tea was expensive for a Chinese restaurant at $5.90 per glass per person. Overall an expensive meal for an average experience. Not sure why this is a one star Michelin restaurant as stated in the menu?
