Every time I’m in Singapore, I have a lunch in this restaurant, and it never changes. My laksa was as usual, delicious. Service was quick, no hassle.

Visited today the SPC and had a full lunch with my family. Food was good, portions nice. Service was slow as usually.

We ate lunch at the Verandah. Good food, good service, and a relaxing atmosphere. This must be one of the only places in Singapore where you can eat with a such a wide view.

We came for a (booked) Sunday lunch as a birthday treat for my husband. What a mistake. Ever since the catering has been taken over the service has gone from slow and apologetic/friendly to slower, indifferent and rude. A little reminder- the customer is not to blame if you’re busy and understaffed. That’s not our problem. The waiter barked at our daughter for daring to ask for a menu, didn’t bother to take a drinks order before leaving with our food order. Food took 45 minutes to arrive - cold and overcooked in the case of the fish - dry and tasteless to the point we had to compare the taste to see if it was in fact the advertised cod. “Greens” consisted of 3 leaves of lettuce with a bit of balsamic vinegar.Getting drinks before we left was another semi-futile exercise- “we serve tables one by one as they come” ? What does that mean - don’t order until everyone who arrived before you leaves? The club still benefits from location and greenery, but I noticed the shocked faces of many other customers as they were treated rudely and abruptly- no wonder all these clubs are on their last legs. It’s sure going to be the last time we waste our money there

Our host is a member of the club and we went there a couple of times for a meal. They have a simple menu, but an adequate choice and the sweet and sour pork dish was very tasty. On another visit the English breakfast was excellent for brunch

Discovered this lovely club last time in Singapore - luckily on a Tuesday so we could see polo at 5 o'clock. This trip we lunched! The food was some of the best we've ever had in Singapore and the best creme brulee I've EVER had. Perfect weather! Delightful young waiter looked after us

I do not know there is such a place in Singapore if I am not working nearby. On a nice Friday, we went there for lunch. Environment is good, did not manage to see any horse as they are not having training. A good place to catch up although the place is not that accessible. Food are fine with mid-range price

Great food at reasonable prices. The cost of drinks (alcoholic) will boost your bill (as it does anywhere in Singapore. However, I love taking visitors there on Tuesday or Thursday for an early dinner (from 5pm) to watch the polo matches from the verandah. Just double check before you go that a match is playing, as they start up from March. If I had to fault one, sometimes the service can be slow

The Polo club serves an ordinary western and local menu but the quality of the food is usually very good. This visit somehow was disappointing cos the fish n chip's standard has dropped. Chips were good but not the fish. Batter was ok but the fish meat was more mushy this time. The other dishes were still fine. Overall still a good place to hangout

We played tennis, had lunch with friends, and generally loitered by the pool and our children played in the play area. All good. The minced chicken with lime was well seasoned and delicious, the burger was good, and the mutton dum biriyani was very good. A great view, friendly staff, and definitely recommended

excellent view of the polo range. food was average. try the western dishes - especially grilled chicken with mash.
bad point - this place is too x1000 hot in the afternoons. even with full fans , it is still tooox1000 hot.

The food and prices are good. The place is fantastic. But service can be improved.
Lovely place to chill, read, or catch up with friends.

Went there on a evening, parking was free and getting a table was easy as well. Nice place for lunch/dinner, away from the city centre. Menu is pack with local and western delights.Service was quick however, was not really impress by the food presentation, and staff was not keen and detailed enough to assist the patrons. Nonetheless food was still alright for my liking and the location was a nice place for a catching up session

Sadly we were there during "haze" (pollution from Indonesian forest fires) so the horses could not play the sport and were only being walked not run, so they would not breath in too much yuck. Even so seeing the space in which matches are played and having tea with a charming friendly couple I know in Singapore was a lovely occasion

I went there to grab a light bite on a quiet afternoon, and was confronted by one of the worst service I have ever encountered. Not only were the staff impatient, inattentive, and unconcerned with your needs, they were also rude and unhelpful when I asked questions about the dishes available, and how long it would take for me to be served. In the end, I ordered a bruschetta which ended up coming quickly and it tasted really delicious. That was really unexpected, given the crappy service by the wait staff (not just one, but a few of them!

Had a fish & chip, reminding of the Fish & chip i had at Mt Pleasant, Perth, W.A. Here they serve a variety of western and local food. The Viet. Beef ball noodle is nice.should try once in the morning for a breakfast.The staff are friendly and feel free to talk and joke with them am sure to enjoy the stay.Facing the large field for Polo sport. Place are well shaded and would be extremely nice with cool breeze. I am a person that sweat a lot, nut i am feeling comfortable there. Thumb up. of 5

The Singapore Polo Club is a great place to spend an afternoon in the large colonial style pavilion overlooking the lush green polo ground in the heart of the city.The Roti Prata with curry and the Prawn Sambal Java were really very authentic.Great place to sip beer and enjoy a quiet afternoon.Staff is nice and friendly.On the weekend, entry is only for members but non-members can visit the rest of the week

I have been many times to eat in this gorgeous setting, of lush green and if you are early enough you will be able to watch the polo horses. You do not need to be a member if you go during the week. Some menu items are really good - Pizzas, fish and chips and curries are my favourite. The service is a bit slow at times however but that is my only negative point. It is perfect if you have just been to the spa as well.

Very out of the way in a good way the Polo Club is a great spot to get away from the Singapore hustle and bustle. The verandah is a perfect place to just relax for a few hours. Food is generally pretty good - favorites are the chicken curry and the hor fun. The menu also has western dishes including a good burger. Good selection of beer and wine at not so bad prices. If you are looking for something a little different definitely go. Be aware it is only open to non members during the week

We go reasonably regularly on Sundays and as long as you manage your expectations you can have an excellent meal. Granted the service is not really up to high end restaurant standard but it is honest and friendly and if you engage the staff politely and nicely you'll find them incredibly eager to please rather than if you just complain, sometimes you need to put in to get back..........Value for money wise it's very tough to beat, especially given the ambience and the opportunity to watch a polo match right in front of you if you're there later in the day.The food can be a bit variable granted and it helps if you know the menu in that respect. Last evening was a typical example where I ordered the mutton biriyani which was superb and my wife ordered the mutton curry which was dreadful! The staff offered immediately to take the curry off the bill, my wife had an ice cream cone instead and everyone was happy.Do not expect 5 star cuisine and 5 star service, you might have to wait around occasionaly for something but for the price and the setting it's a pretty good deal we think
