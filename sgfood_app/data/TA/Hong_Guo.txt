It's just a very ordinary place, if you never tried Yunnan rice noodle, worth a try. The concept is just put every raw material in the soup by yourself.

I had no idea about Honguo’s dishes except that it looked Chinese. But we decided to give it a try. Pleasant surprise! Service was warm and attentive while facility was cozy. Food was even better. We had 3 simple dishes of Szechuan chicken basket, dou miao veggies in garlic, and shanghai pork dumplings. All were really good. Be careful with the chicken basket as it contains many red chilis. Try pairing those with drinks of lychee aloe vera and iced lemon tea. We failed to order their specialty of xi mian and cross the bridge noodles with plenty of side dishes. That would be a good reason to come back.

A sundate lunch with friends and decided to try something new and hopped in to 红锅, a cuisine from Yun Nan - China.Ambience fits the cuisine well but..Food served shortly after we have placed our orders. I ordered less spicy and when it came, I saw a thick layer of chili oil. I felt really unhealthy at the very moment (probably its name as 红锅). My friend ordered Mi Xian with the 15 sides dishes was really good and love the soup base after all had been mixed. We ordered some side dishes and I love the crispy silver fish. The vegetable that we ordered was really salty.Overall, its so so only.Jazly

I have always returned tot his restaurant whenever I want a good food fix at affordable prices.The service is prompt. As soon as you are seated, you can place your order by writing on the chit available at each table. The food will start getting served within 10 mins depending on what you order.Here is what I usually order: Garlic cucumber (very refreshing esp when you order lots of other spicy food), sze chuan chicken (very aromatic), crispy silverfish (it is tasty and crispy), pumpkin w salted egg (nicely cooked and soft on the inside, eat it while it is hot), Zhaung Yuan Mi Xian (the soup is very delicious!!)The last item allows you select the number of ingredients you want to add to the noodle soup, we went for the max (think it's 15?)We tried one of their new rice vermicelli sets - Hot Sour; it was surprisingly good! I was expecting it to be too spicy or too sour...it was nicely balanced - good job! The noodles went really well with the soup. Comes with a free drink.Beverage wise, I highly recommend the Honey Lemon Sour Plum - much better than the salty dog in my opinion...right balance of sweet and tinge of sour. Delightful!

We had no idea what food we were going to get when we entered this place. We were beat after a long day of sight seeing and just wanted to sit and have a decent meal. I must say that though the staff knew very little English, they never got frustrated. They tried their best to explain to us when we asked any questions about what is there is any dish. We had the Garlic cucumber which was spicy to say the least. However it was extremely tasty. Since my partner is vegetarian, we asked them if they could make any one of their Rice/Noodles without egg/meat/seafood. They obliged with a smile. They gave a nice hot water to drink since our throats were sore and worn out, which was very kind of them. I had the Beef fried rice and the pork dumpling in Chilli sauce. Dumplings just melted in my mouth and the fried rice was seasoned perfectly. It was spicy but it was exactly what I wanted. Size of the serving is also quite good. After the dumpling I could not finish my fried rice and had to get it packed as a midnight snack. On the whole a very lovely meal and it was made even better by the pleasant service of the staf

This place is often quite full and I think it is because most of the items are below S$10 which is good value compared to the other eating places in the building. One of their specialties is the "Cross the Bridge" Noodles. Basically you get some very nice noodles with between 9 and 15 tiny plates of condiments and a huge bowl of piping hot soup. You (or the wait staff) puts all the items into the soup followed by the noodles. The noodles and soup were quite tasty (although many will say bland" but even though you have between 9 and 15 items, they are basically a teaspoon+ for each item and you don't really get a lot for the money. If you think Japanese ramen is poor value for the amount of non-noodles you get, this is probably worse.So, quite good, but I think they need to be more generous with the items you add to the soup (other than the noodles). Also, the picture shows 2 large unpeeled prawns and what I got was 2 tiny peeled prawn. Charge a dollar more if you must. Their other dishes look good thoug

Keep coming back here for their fried rice with chicken chop in lotus leave. The chicken was well done and crispy yet juicy. The fried rice was tasty. This with their sambal (need to request) makes the whole meal just wonderful. It also comes with soup. Sometimes they offer a set with drink
