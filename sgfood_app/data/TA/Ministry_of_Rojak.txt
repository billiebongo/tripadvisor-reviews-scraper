The Ministry of Rojak serves fresh and yummy Rojak in a clean and air conditioned environment. Gravy is nice and fragrant too. Especially love the cuttlefish, prawn fritters, fish and fishcake. So glad that there is a gem like this in Pasir Ris, White Sands Shopping Mall. Note: The Indian Rojak is best eaten at the eatery. The takeaway version is a bit less shiok.

Very bee delicious! I love the way they fry the items, crispy n fresh. Gravy is out of this world. Small little place but cosy. Reasonable pricing. Clearing of table slow & some chairs greasy. I can compromise this with the delicious taste of Rojak!!! Great place for Muslim cos halal. Definitely will return.

The Ministry of Rojak is an excellent typical Singaporean Indian Style Rojak that you should try. For many we call this - Rojak Mama.You see, for all Rojak Mama stall, all of them taste the same, but the thing that differentiate them all are always the Sambal Rojak (Rojak Sauce).Well people, this place is different, the Sambal Rojak is full of flavour & once you dip that Rojak of yours in the sambal, you will know why.AC indoor seating are available with very limited seating's. I advise you to do a take away or once you are done with eating, whatever you are wearing or your hair will smell of Rojak!Pricing is relative standard. I had a $30 Rojak that manage to feed 4 hungry adults
