The cafe had a very old colonial feel and the selection of cakes and pastries were more than enough to make anyone want everything.
The Shibuya Toast was lovely and I believe everyone should try it!

Great breakfast cafe in nice neighborhood.
Brilliant Kaya toast, with nice kopi & teh,
friendly staff with very reasonable prices.
Been here many times for breakfast & will continue to go back again & again.

Not all westerners will like these breakfast combinations but the place is clearly authentic. If you look for a small authentic place near the arab street, this could be nice for you

Quaint little Bakery cafe situated in a cultural rich heritage attraction provides good quality spread of traditional toast and Pastries. Cafe setting of 70s brings back the memories of old days...

Somehow this is my favourite place for local tea in Singapore. The ambience of the old shophouse rather than a generic location perhaps helps. The tea itself is pretty much the same as you get anywhere else, but the ambience makes it somehow better. I've been back a few times already so far this year, and no complaints as yet

We ate here for bfast. They serve kopi tiam speciality food and coffe. This place perfect for bfast or having a afternoon snack. The food is good, as I can find better than this. But the place is good. There are many vintage stuff and ornaments. Their service also fab, serve with smile and friendly

Plenty of character in this small local cafe in Kandahar street. Great to get away from the various local chain cafes and experience something a bit more authentic. Been here around 5 times in total now, just for tea or coffee, but it's always got a nice vibe to it. Happy to return again

A nostalgic Kopitiam set in the midst of Kampung Glam. The variety of beverages would be about the same as Ah Kun Kaya Toast and Toast Box or any other similar F&B outlets that sell similar product.I tried the Rum Cake that was sold in the display case. Comparing the taste and texture with Polar Cake, it lacks the spongy softness and the rum flavor was too light. It did not deliver the punch of rum require

Tucked away this lovely coffee and tea house serves the traditional kopi and delicious pastries. I have been back again and again as I just love the atmosphere and history. Run by a 4th generation baker, the traditional pastries (almond finger, sponge cake, coconut tart) are awesome. They innovated the sponge cake in a tall column shape to make them easier to dunk in your coffee. The walls are covered with antique Chinese pin up girl advertisement posters. Just a special spot and very reasonably priced

Came here today for a tea after lunch nearby. Great atmosphere and a nicely renovated shophouse. Usually these places will be serving higher end tea and coffee but it was a nice surprise to find regular local tea here. I'll have to come back for sure
5
The ice coffee is super nice.
Try the Kaya Butter Toast tea set and you will miss it.
The price is very reasonable and it uses traditional way to make the milk tea/ coffee and toast üëç
Highly recommended.

I brought the family (3 Gens) as some have not been here.
Everyone loves the food and drinks. Part of the charm is its setting.
Service is friendly and prompt. They offered some takeaways ie Kaya which is homemade.
Great place to spend an afternoon.

This cafe is good to start your day with local style breakfast. We fell in love with toasts with butter and kaya coconut curd which is made by themselves. Friendly staff and quick service.
4
this place is lovely very quaint decor with lovely tea and nice cakes at a very reasonable price. If you looking for a cheap sugar hit with some delicious tea than you will find it here!

Good old traditional local favorites.
Kaya was fragrant and mildly sweet, lamington was tasty and coffee & tea were thick and rich.
Love the ambience of this cafe.
Highly recommended.

Been here a few years ago, came again as we are visiting haji lane. Enjoyable experience, will recommend both locals and tourists to pay them a visit!

This was a very pleasant surprise - a super smart fairly priced cafe hidden away in the Arab Quarter. Service, food, ambience was spot on. A hidden gem
5
Tuck in a quiet street (near Masjid Sultan), this cafe serve delicious old time favourites , Kopi-O/Kopi C or Tea with Kaya Toast, half boiled egg, cakes and puff.My favourite is the lamington - soft, moist, coated with strawberry and desiccated coconut ; don't miss this in your visit ! A detour to this cafe during a hot day for your favourite dessert is worthwhile

I love Dong Po! Love the facade, the interior, it's a not so big cafe in Bugis, I tried their special toast which was sooo GOOD. I'm a fan of sweets, the texture of the bread is so nice with special caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream on top. Feels so heavenly. We also tried their egg, bread and butter toast which tastes good as well. The price? Won't hurt your pocket even a bit. Trust me, good for breakfast, snack or simply chit chatting with friends.

Nice place to visit, as the name suggests reflective of a past Singapore. Location near Arab Street is good. Food is ok for a cafe, a bit of a limited menu but good cafe stuff. Open for breakfast over the weekend but limited to a few dishes only.
4
Quaint, independent, retro cafe serving very good cakes, pastries and great coffee.
Good local vibe and decor.
No table service but staff is quick and efficient at the counter.
5
Luvin e pyramid dark chocolate cake whenever I visit dong po. A great cafe for cakes selection below $2.50 with friends, family or just alone.
3
Good value for money all day snacks and beats the commercial toast box and Kopitiam.
They even have lamingtons n chocolate eclair. Egg n toast set was 4.50.
4
This is a great place to have your local coffee or tea. Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is great. Pricing is reasonable. You will feel welcome here
5
Down memory lane in food and deco, great place to sit and have a bite, traditional cakes, authentic traditional coffee and tea. They even have bread and butter pudding and scones which is fantastic.
Price good, value for money.

Retro cafe or rather kopi tiam with aircond. Kopi is nice, think and aromatic. Simple decor with artefacts dating back to the 60s , 70s , 80s - nostalgic . Besides kopi, the pastries are tasty and fresh. Overall, a good place to be at to take a breather and enjoy the kopi that plied the streets of yesteryears. Price wise - no complains. Great place, Friendly Staff, Great Ambience and Great KOPI ! A must d

We popped in here after being recommended it for the kaya toast breakfasts. It was late evening so instead we opted for cakes and tea. The cakes were yummy and very cheap, the service was fast and friendly, and it was a nice place to stop in a quieter street than the busy lanes and streets that surround it. Recommend it for a stop

If you ever want to experience life in the 60s in Singapore and Malaysia, then you got to visit this Cafe. For someone like me who grew up in the 60s, it brought back a flood of memories.This quaint little cafe offers hot and cold drinks and a good spread of home-made cakes, pastries, and cookies.A good place to stop after lunch to get your drink and dessert, or come in the mid afternoon with friends and enjoy the variety of cakes with your tea/coffee. It is hard to find a cafe like this in Singapore, where you can get away from the maddening crowd and frightfully hot Singapore weather and just enjoy a quiet time with friends and family seeping tea and enjoying the delicacies from this cafe.Great food, great service and great ambience

The place serves breakfast items.It has a few types of set menus which you can choose, from toast to cakes.I love how they toast the breads. Light and crispy. The kaya spread has unique taste too. Not too sweet and heavy.Milk tea is not too thick too.As for the cakes. They have a range of traditional bakes which include Australian, lamination cakes too. If you miss traditional bakes, do visit this place.There is outdoor and indoor sitting. Not a very big place but comfortable.Do visit early over the weekend to avoid the crowd.There are parking lots available there too

It's really nice to know there's such a nice cosy local cafe selling nice teh and great cakes.Will usually order set D that comes with a tea/coffee + 2 cakes of your choice. My favourite is the chocolate truffle. Tried the rum ball once and brought back good memories of my childhood days.Only not so ideal thing is that the cafe closes early on weekdays so not a place to catch supper or late night kopi session with friends here
